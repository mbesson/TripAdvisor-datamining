We had a king suite. Our room was clean and comfortable. The only odd thing was the layout with the bathroom door - if you opened the door from the toilet/shower area it nearly touched the sink outside - open carefully if you think someone might be brushing his teeth or plan to apologize for clobbering him with the door. The crew at breakfast did a great job of keeping things cleaned and stocked though a little more variety for fresh fruit might have been nice. There were grapefruit and apples everyday. A couple days there were oranges and bananas. There were also make-your-own waffles, scrambled eggs, another hot selection that varied (sausage, potatoes, biscuits/gravy), oatmeal, yogurt, cereal, muffins, bread/bagels. The noise level in the hotel was mixed. It was far enough from the highway that we didn't hear road noise, but we faced the courtyard with the pool so heard the revelers in the hot tub until they closed it down at 10 PM. The hallway doors were nice and tight, but the walls still pass quite a bit of sound - babies crying, people on the phone. One morning they started doing some very loud work in the hallway outside our room at 10 AM, one way to make sure we got out and about after a late night I guess. The location worked well for us since we visited Legoland north in Carlsbad and spent time south in San Diego.

The room did not smell that bad, but the hallway was atrocious. To the Hotel's credit, they did offer to move me the next day, but at that point I did not feel like packing up and moving. The hotel is decent, but showing some signs of needing updating. Older cabinets, carpeting and cracking grout in bathtub. I agree that not having wireless in the room is a little odd.

We wanted to be close enough to home to keep an eye on the progress of the repairs and also be comfortable, and to me, that means being able to cook our meals. I am a local internet marketing consultant so I am all about checking reviews online before I make a decision about where to buy, eat, stay, etc. This particular had great reviews so we booked 2 suites. From the very first time we walked in, stressed, upset, and my mother almost in tears, we felt like we were home. All of the staff are so kind and generous, going out of their way to make sure guests have everything they could possibly need. There were a few who stuck out though, and in the best way possible. Stephanie made my mother feel sol much better, just by being attentive, chatting with her, getting to know her. She always asked how things were going at the house and made my mother really feel hat she cared about her welfare. The chaos of the demolition in her house was extremely stressful for her and being able to come back to Homewood Suites after being amidst the debris and the construction was like a balm to her. She was able to head upstairs after chatting with Stephanie or one of the other front desk staff and unwind for awhile before I brought dinner to her. I am a night owl and got to know the staff who worked the afternoon and night shifts a bit better. Monica was, during the time we stayed, worked in the evenings and many times I would wander down and chat. because most of my work is dependent on having a good internet connection, when there were occasional issues, she bent over backward to find a solution, whether it was calling any one of the wonderful maintenance staff to trouble shoot, or running next door to find a cable I needed. These folks are so efficient, thoughtful and frankly, creative in the way they take care of their guests. I have traveled a great deal in my time on the planet, as has my mother and we have both stayed in so many hotels, neither of us could even begin to count them. Out of all of them, we both agree this is the absolute best experience we have ever had . From the physical space, the rooms, the actual kitchen...really...with a stove,a dishwasher and a real refrigerator where I could actually cook, and did, every day, to the housekeepers, the maintenance guys, all of the front desk staff, especially Stephanie during the day, Monica in the evening (though she works during the day now) and Dan,my favorite night desk man, these people take pride of place and service to heart. All of them, every last one of them, made what was a very unpleasant experience for my mother and me and turned it into a rather fun little adventure...one where we actually made friends and felt truly cared for. They wear many, many hats, wear them extremely well and are at home in all of them. We are grateful we found them...and I have decided that the next time I need a vacation from my mother, I am running to my other home in Del Mar.

I only stay at Hilton's for their great rewards program; so I know Hilton pretty well. The Homewood Suites in Del Mar, CA is by far the best overall hotel. The staff is so great, you'd think they were all part owners (and i have never wanted to take the time to get on this site and write a review before). Last year i got sick, the front desk offered to bring me meals as well as a free VCR with a library of movies. This year, a boiler had gone out, so I had no hot water when I woke up. i went to the front desk who were very sincere and offered me a shower in their spa; which i planned on using during lunch. Only by lunch time, the boiler was back up to full speed. The manager asked if I needed anything else. I did need a haircut, so she booked me one. When i went in for the cut, they said i would get 50% off. Well the hair cut, shampoo and style was probably the best ever (when I got home, my wife said, \"finally! a great haircut'). After the cut, I paid the 50% i owed and left the rest for a tip; about $20. When i returned to my room later that night, there was an envelope with a note from the manager saying, \"Sir, sorry for the misunderstanding. Your service for today was compt. Please see attached\". When I turned the letter over, there was my $20!!! This hotel truly cares more about their guest than making an extra buck.

The front desk staff was always available to answer questions and provide assistance (we needed a pencil, we got a pencil; we needed dish detergent, we got dish detergent). Breakfast was well displayed. Food was good except for two items: coffee which was weak and the oatmeal which was more consistent with congee instead of oatmeal. Kudos to server David who was there on two of the days - working with a fractured rib and thumb. Talk about dedication. The afternoon meals were good and they always had ample amounts of drinks, food, and beer on hand. Nobody was ever searching for additional food. Two knocks: 1) the pool was not working while we were there (under renovation). We were directed to the Hilton Garden Inn which was 50 feet away (so, it was not much of an issue - except for the need for someone to let us in because the HGI pool required a HGI key card). 2) no WiFi.

This is the second time coming to the Del Mar Homewood Suites, and though the rates were a lot higher than normal for this time, I understand supply/demand given the high reviews for the hotel and that this was the 4th of July weekend here. Most of the people that normally stay here are businesspeople I believe who have work in the nearby Del Mar/La Jolla/Carmel Valley area, but there are a large amount of families too I think given the value proposition. Service first of all is pretty great. I would think that the people here are all from the MIdwest in terms of the attitude [friendly] but they are also very motivated to help [eager]. That's a great thing. Negatives here are that they don't have bellboy service, so if you want someone to help with your luggage then this is not for you. They didn't have dual double beds so we ended up with a King for our stay of the family of 4 [kids are 6 and almost 4], and that was a little struggle. Sleep quality would be higher if we had double beds I think. They have free wired internet, but who does wired in the iPad/iPhone era? WiFi would be really nice in the rooms. The pool is also small, so when it's crowded it's not as fun and there aren't many chairs. The pool towels are also basically the golf towels with the blue or green line down the center and with a rough feel, so if your tushy needs to be babied instead of just dried, then don't expect Frette quality or anything near that there. Other than that, the sheets are fine [it's San Diego, so no need for down comforters], and the shower is decent. I'd love to have a double sink basin, but no need of course. The kitchen is great, and the topper are the complementary breakfast buffets [with waffles for the kids, though there's almost always a line] and happy hours [meals during the week] with beer and wine. My waist didn't thank me, but my stomach did.... The kids also got balloons and different little rubber duckies at breakfast one day which was a great touch, as well as opening up their Del Mar Ballroom when there was an overflow at breakfast. They played some kid movies on the TV in there, which made for a long but entertaining breakfast for the kids. Overall, it's a great stay, and usually great value. As it was, it was darn good.

For the active-types, you'll certainly get your running in with the surrounding hills and spacious bike lanes which will take you right to Torrey Pines, or should you crave a little more inland trail running action, Los Penasquitos Inland Preserve resides just to the east. There are beach supplies available for rent (beach chairs, umbrella, boogie board) individually or as a package deal ($30) which is convenient for beach-goers that packed light. There are multiple grocery stores (Vons) and restaurants within driving distance or utilize the handy shuttle provided by Homewood Suites. There is plenty of room in a King-size suite to stock up the fridge and freezer. The room itself was very well kept and housekeeping maintained strong attention to detail by restocking the room with fresh towels each day. Kitchen supplies are abundant all the way down to the mini-cutting board. Our room overlooked the courtyard in which a small pool and hot tub were situated among tropical plants. We also checked out their evening reception as the schedule was posted on the fridge. Their daily offerings vary from enchiladas, teriyaki chicken, and of course the BBQ Thursday nights. While outside dining options throughout San Diego are delicious, the evening reception is convenient and satisfying as it is accompanied by a full and fresh salad bar. The wine offerings left much to be desired. It would be nice to see some offerings from local vineyards (i.e. Temecula). Breakfast showcased the strength of Homewood Suites with real eggs (not that powdery, dry stuff), sausage, bacon, potatoes, fresh fruit (not day-old), and waffles. CONS: It was tough to find one, however, travelers should note that wireless internet access is available only on the first floor rooms. Only hardwired, ethernet connections are available on the other floors. This may be problematic for some - not all.

Family of four including two teenagers. We booked a king bed suite adjacent to the pool using the hilton web site for 200$ plus tax a night. The suite was quite nice (ground floor) with bay window that opened on a small table + chairs area with view on the pool. The masters room was quite nice, great king bed, comfy bed, great pillows, i had great nights of sleep no problem. Very little noise from the outside. Rooms are well insulated. The living area was nice as well, altough the sofa bed was a bit rudimentary. The two teenagers slept on it but complained a bit on the comfort of the sofa bed so i would not recommend it for adults. The pool is nice, there is a jacuzzi as well (small) but quite handy after a full day of sightseeing in order to relax. The staff was very helpful and friendly, the self-parking around the hotel, very easy to go by. There are no restaurants at the hotel but you can walk across to the hilton garden inn and you have a quite decent restaurant - we tried it one evening - with decent food and prices. There is as well a snack bar at the hilton garden inn where they have great sandwiches, we always loaded up with food to go at the snack bar before we hit the road towards the beaches, parks, etc... You must have a car to visit around. There is a von's grocery store less than five minutes drive, so you can get all you need as well for snacks or if you want to use the kitchenette area in the suite to cook your own meals. The breakfast buffet was quite OK and it's included with your room fee. If you are back at the hotel between 17h and 19h from monday-thursday evening, you even have the managers reception free of charge. On Thursday evening they had a nice BBQ and salad bar outside by the pool area... free of charge... so we loaded up before hitting the road to go to the padres baseball game downtown. It is a very nice hotel and i would say very convenient for a family. The only drawback is that the hotel is a bit remote from the main san diego areas, it's location is however easy access from highway 5. Our favorite beach from our trip : La Jolla Shores (beautiful beach!). Our favorite nature hike : torrey pines state reserve (10 minutes drive from the hotel) a must see i would say. Our favorite attraction : san diego zoo and balboa park. It's a great area. I definitely recommend both the destination and the hotel. /Montrealer2", "Date": "July 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, California", "Title": "\u201cfamily reunion\u201d", "Author": "califorvacation", "ReviewID": "UR70448787", "Content": "we came to san diego for a family reunion and stayed here for a week. loved the dinners with wine and beer, and the hearty breakfast. staff was super friendly. room really big and we bought our own groceries to save on money. very clean and suffiecient.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cSuites, dinner and breakfast, allright!\u201d", "Author": "mehudson1", "ReviewID": "UR70444721", "Content": "Very nice accomodations.

When my husband and I travel, we try to find a hotel that offers breakfast and free parking, this one met our criteria and then some by including dinner. We did have ONE DISAPPOINTMENT during our stay however. One afternoon, we returned to our room about 4:00 p.m. and I noticed the bathroom door was shut. When I went in, there was a very strong smell of cigarette smoke!. (We do not smoke and always ask for a non smoking room). This was fresh smoke and I know for a fact that someone was just in there smoking prior to our return! I called the front desk right away to let them know and to ask for fresh clean towels. Someone brought the towels and some air freshner, which I guess was all that could be done for us at that point. It's rather disappointing and infuriating to know that an employee goes in to a guest room/bathroom to smoke. For all we know, this could have happened on other days of our stay and the smoke disappated before we got back, or it could have happened in someone else's room too. I don't know what management did to look in to this matter when I reported it, but hopefully they found out who it was and let that employee go. Despite that, I do recommend this hotel for all the positives we did experience. One suggstion I have for the hotel to consider is installing a towel bar or hooks on the door to hang towels.

Their motto was make yourself at home and we did - using the bbq and setting up our w/end meals in the dining area, with smiles all around (no dirty looks at the kids or dirty dishes). My only regret is not taking advantage of the early booking rate which would've saved us more $$. Family with 6, 8 & 10yr old.

They also had a mini buffett with a nice simple salad and some other food. I wished they had a vegetarian option other than the meat option for the buffet, but can't complain since it was free. The location is easy and close to the beach if you have a car. If not, it's too far to walk. But, there's a free shuttle that can drop you at the beach area in Del Mar and then pick you up when you're ready. The walls are a bit thin so you can somewhat hear your neighbors. The rooms are nicely decorated, but I'd wish they'd lose the silk plants. They are just dust collectors no matter how clean a room is. Couldn't they just get a simple real potted plant that does not require a lot of water? The flat screen TV was nice, and the bed had a poor quality mattress. I think you just need to make sure you really get a suite, as we thought we'd have one, and to our suprise, it was just a couch on the other side of the room opposite the bed! We were traveling with a small baby and wanted that extra room to be able to not disturb her when she was sleeping. I hear from others that the rooms do differ and some are really suite like with a separation between rooms, so make sure you ask for what you want if they have it available. I'd stay here again. Front desk was friendly and helpful. Next door is a SPA at the Hilton Garden Inn and I got a nice hair cut. It's a bit pretentious there with all the Spa rules though..they have a SPA Etiquette list on the back of the pamplet that made me almost not go there. I ended up going anyway to the spa for a haircut with my daughter and it was empty. Not sure why all the rules, but per the rules, they don't want kids (i.e ones that can make noise). Luckily they let me bring my kid who was good, but who wants to go to a place where you're not really welcome with your little one? I would have spent a heck of a lot more money there if they were more welcoming with in their pamplet.

We had booked a 2 bedroom room but this had a problem when we arrived, so was offered this as an alternative and it was fantastic as ended up with 2 living areas, so the big kids could have a sofa bed each, and was on the ground floor, so close to the pool and eating area. We headed out each day to the Wild Animal Park, Seaworld and the Zoo and found this to be an easy spot to get to these destinations with the Zoo probably the furtherest away at about 30 minute drive. We also drove to Coronado and the surrounding beaches leading to San Diego, like La Jolla. All of San Diego is connected up by freeways, which is very different coming from Australia, so didn't feel that when we headed into San Diego itself that we were missing out on much by not staying in the central areas. You do need to hire a car to get around and a GPS is a must, as would have got completely lost without ours. This hotel is in a nice residential/working area and whilst there isn't anything around it, there is a good supermarket just up the road, which we found handy as did end up cooking pasta for the kids as found my 2 yr old really didn't like much of the food anywhere! La Jolla is a close drive and there are restaurants and shopping there if you want to go out but while we stopped one night for sushi in La Jolla, the other nights we were exhausted after big days and ate at the hotel and crashed! Two major bonuses of staying here was the laundry, which when traveling with kids meant we could wash everything and not have to carry as much, and the other bonus was the free dinners during the week, which we were apprehensive of but tried the first night and decided it was just as good as most of the food we had been having! The rooms are nicely decorated in a homely way and are very clean and comfortable. Having the TV/kitchen area means they are a really good size and the king bed is deluxe.

I always like to research hotels and was only hesitant to choose Homewood because of the location (not close to Sea World). However, we were not disappointed! We arrived Monday afternoon, with just enough time for the kids to enjoy the pool. The \"light snacks\" are really a full meal. We had lasagna, bread and salad that first evening. Other nights we had fajitas with rice and beans, and stir fry with rice. Breakfast is nice hot buffet with eggs, potatoes/sausage, oatmeal, waffles, cold cereals, muffins, bagels, toast, juice and coffee. The coffee is always available in the lobby. We also used the laundry, and spent only $3 to wash and dry a full load of wet, sandy clothes. The room was great, especially when travelling with kids. We had a one bedroom suite (2 queens) and a sofa sleeper. Plenty of room for us to move around without feeling crowded. The full kitchen was very handy when the kids didn't want stir fry. I ran to the grocery store on the first night (about 1.5 miles away, easy to find) and picked up some mac and cheese, hot dogs and milk. The kitchen has only a stove top, no oven, but that was fine for us. Again, the evening meal really is a meal, not a snack. We figured we saved about $200 on meals by staying here. The room was well worth the price. The staff was very warm and friendly. The location is quiet and only about 12 miles from Sea World (easy access to the 5 freeway and maybe 10 minutes to La Jolla beaches).

We stayed for a week (11-18 June 2009) in a one bedroom suite with 2 queen beds and LOVED it! Location: For a week\u2019s trip to the San Diego area, we LOVED Del Mar. We thought it was quite, nice, and scenic. After seeing all the sites and driving by other locations such as Hotel Circle and Gaslamp, we were so glad that we were in Del Mar instead. It could be nearly 30 minutes to some of the attracts at the wrong time of day, but it was so worth it. Room: The room is actually 3 rooms. The first is a kitchen, living room, and dining all in one. The kitchen is nearly a full kitchen including dishes, a dish washer, garbage disposal, stove, microwave, and fridge. The only thing not included is dish soap. In the living area is an average size TV. This room includes a desk. I believe high speed Internet access was available, but we didn\u2019t bring a computer with us. The cable on the TV includes many good kid friendly channels with movies and video games for rent. The bedroom was a good size. The two queen beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room for a crib, which they provided. The sink/mirror area in actually in the bedroom. I was able to use it without waking my children. Another TV is in the bedroom. The bathroom contains a shower/bath and toilet. They were good about providing cleans towels. The cleaning service did a great job. Once they came while I was dealing with a fussy baby. She said she would come back and left right away. The best part was that they always found time to come back when we weren\u2019t there and did a thorough job cleaning. Breakfast: They have a hot breakfast buffet everyday that includes items such as eggs, potatoes, bacon or sausage. They had cold items like yogurt, cereal, and fruit (oranges, bananas, and apples). They have the do-it-yourself waffle makers. The only truly bad thing at breakfast was the coffee. It was HORRID. I tried flavored creamers, sugars, etc, but it could NOT be saved. It consistently tasted too strong and brunt. The first day my favorite breakfast item was the seasoned potatoes with peppers and onions. They were perfect and delicious! However, in following days they were tamed down and less seasoned. I\u2019m sure they were more kid friendly, but disappointing to me when on the first day they were so flavorful. Amenities: We used the pool once. The girl at the desk thought it was heat to 82 degrees. It felt a bit cooler than that to me. It was early evening though and probably not the best time to swim. I like that they have plenty of lounge chairs and spare towels in the pool area. The business center is just 2 computers with Internet connection. I only got on there briefly to check e-mail. It did the job, but was running slow. The laundry room is two washers and two dryers that are coin operated. I paid a total of $4 to do 2 loads. It was nice to not go home with a week\u2019s worth of dirty laundry. They only powdered Tide in their micro store, so bring something else if you want it. We didn\u2019t get to use the manager\u2019s reception as we were out running around too much. Price: I thought the price was pretty decent especially considering the fact that they didn\u2019t have parking fees or resort fees. We paid something like $175 a night plus tax.

I even felt comfortable enough to not wear shoes while lounging around in the living room. While the room was in the right configuration and clean, the room is not the highlight of this hotel. The staff was absolutely EXCELLENT. So often, the hotel has the goods (the rooms) but the staff is not helpful or courteous or is in some way lacking. This was not the case here. First off, we checked in kind of late (almost midnight) and the night host was chipper and cheerful. He insisted that I park right outside the front door so it would be easier to carry bags up to the room. He let us know the various amenities available in the lobby and what we could expect at breakfast. He talked it up so much, that despite my fatigue from being up so late, I got up early and went to the free breakfast buffet. It was excellent! We had decided to go to the beach, but didn't know where to go or what to do. Another helpful staffer came by to clear some of our breakfast dishes and when we asked him what to do, he gave us many suggestions and his own personal preference for the beaches. He then came back with a map of the area already highlighted and marked with directions to beaches, shopping, and local eateries he thought we might enjoy. He was right on the money with all of it. Thanks to the staff of this hotel, my family and our friends enjoyed some of the most relaxing adventures we have ever encountered and would heartily recommend this hotel (and their OUTSTANDING STAFF) to anyone and everyone.

I researched hotels *endlessly* including all the reviews on Trip Advisor before I booked this hotel. It was not my first choice initially, but after we discussed what we would need for a family-type trip we decided this would be the best bet. I rated the hotel 4 stars for two reasons. One, I booked using the Hilton web site and then tried to call for a lower rate, and they simply would not negotiate--although I'm sure I never got the hotel's actual front desk. I got a much lower rate for the weekend than I did for our \"business\" days from the web site and wanted to see if they would meet it for the rest of our week stay, to no avail. I also marked it lower because there's really nothing super close to the hotel. While there's a shopping area relatively close, to get food or supplies, you basically need a vehicle to get anything you might need. That being said, we had an excellent stay at the Homewood Suites. LOCATION: We visited sites both in San Diego, Carlsbad and Anaheim-area and the hotel was centrally located to those and close to the highway for easy access. It is on a one-way so you have to do U-turns and sometimes come in through the sister hotel next door, but not inconveniently so. (NOTE: We found their highway and road system complicated to negotiate because everything is named virtually the same thing, bypasses do not go in intuitive directions and you never know if there's an on-ramp at the same place you take an off-ramp -- so having it convenient and easily accessible to the highway was a plus!) HOTEL PUBLIC AREAS: The hotel is charming in its way and well-kept. The front desk area is spacious and clean, and the breakfast/reception area was always well maintained. The pool is small and is situated such that I don't think it gets a lot of sunlight, especially in the afternoon, but the area was always clean, the pool was heated, and they had a great whirlpool/hottub. (We were lucky to be there when it was 70s/80s, but we swam even on a night when it was 59!) They had a good supply of towels for the pool area, although it would have been nice if they were a little larger in size. Plenty of comfortable deck chairs. The guest laundry area is smaller (two machines each W/D), but the machines were clean, well-maintained and inexpensive in my opinion ($1/load each machine) and had a folding area for clothes. The business center again was small, but we didn't require it b/c the rooms have free wired internet access that worked fine for us. Fitness center was again small, but had a decent selection of machines for its small size (although they need to pump air into their exercise ball, for sure!!). The breakfast area had a flat screen TV and was bustling, but we always had a place to sit and it was again well-maintained. STAFF: The front desk staff were competent and friendly. Our room was available when we checked in early and they had our reservations easily accessible with information about the hotel and area services also readily available. There were hotel staff and maintainance people always working to keep the areas clean and well maintained, and they, too, were very friendly. The staff seemed to take some pride in keeping the hotel well-maintained. The cleaning staff for our room did a great job, and even though we were definitely living in our room, it was always noticeably more organized when they had been there to clean. I also called for extra towels and other items when I was there, and it was always brought promptly and in one case when I had to leave the room after calling, all items replaced in our room and laid out for us. We were always greeted cheerfully by all staff encountered. ROOM: We booked a 1 bedroom 2 queen suite, and while I agree with some of the other reviewers that it would be more convenient to have at least 1 1/2 bathrooms so you wouldn't have to access the bath in the bedroom all the time (we stayed up later than the kids and it was always an interruption to brush teeth, etc.), it was workable. The rooms were well kept and clean. Not luxuriously spacious but definitely workable. Some of the appliances and items in the room were obviously used, but not in bad shape. The beds were in general comfortable and there was plenty of space in the bedroom. It would have been nice to have towel hooks in the bathroom or some kind of rack to use, as the bath is separate from the vanity area, but again, it was workable. The sitting area was slighly cramped and the furniture not overly comfortable, but definitely workable. The televisions always defaulted to the hotel station and it was INCREDIBLY loud; otherwise, they were fine. It was very convenient to have a microwave, fridge, stovetop and dishwasher available. They even sent snacks to us upon arrival. Overall, very satisified with the room. It would have been nice if the windows had opened more than a crack to get fresh breeze in. OTHER NOTES: The hotel serves complimentary breakfast in the morning, which we feel saved us a ton of money. It wasn't gourmet, of course, and we prefer our eggs a bit more done, but definitely worth it. Daily they had multiple cereals, waffles, eggs, breakfast meat and potatoes, muffins, breads/toast, fresh fruit, yogurt, milk, juices and coffee, although be advised their coffee leaves much to be desired. :-) (It was worth the drive we made every day for starbucks...) The hotel also serves dinner M-R and we found it perfectly acceptable for such an offering. We arrived Thursday night, which is cookout night, and it was a very decent meal of hamburgers, hotdogs, baked beans, and other assorted dinner items. Definitely worth it. The kids weren't interested in the offerings the other nights, but would be doable for adults if you wanted to keep costs down, for sure. There seemed to be many more business travelers than families staying at the hotel, but I actually found that kind of nice. It was quiet and peaceful and we found our stay to be quite pleasant and comfortable. SUMMARY: I feel I'm pretty picky about hotels b/c I stay in them quite a bit. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who was traveling to the San Diego/Del Mar/Carlsbad area. Clean, comfortable, and worth the money -- and even more so if they would negotiate rates more.", "Date": "February 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alaska", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for a family\u201d", "Author": "kaylor02", "ReviewID": "UR23300007", "Content": "We stayed at the Homewood Suites Dec. 26 - 31.

Our family stays here any time my husband's work brings him to San Diego, and we absolutely love it. For starters, the staff is absolutely terrific. Everyone, from the front desk staff to the restaurant staff to the maintenance team, is friendly, helpful and courteous. It is so pleasant to stay at a hotel where you know that you'll be treated wtih respect, and welcomed with a smile, regardless of what your question or concern is. The amenities are fabulous as well. The rooms are true \"suites,\" with fully stocked kitchens and living areas separate from the bedroom area. You can actually cook full meals in the kitchen, although you won't have to Monday thru Thursday nights. On those nights, the hotel offers what they call a \"light meal.\" The last time we were there, their idea of a \"light meal\" was lasagna one night, chicken breasts in mushroom sauce with mashed potatoes the next night, and then their signature BBQ on the patio (complete with burgers, hot dogs and chicken breasts) on Thursday night. Light? I think not! With the meal they offer complimentary beer, wine and kid-friendly drinks like lemonade, so everything (and everyone) is covered. They also have a full breakfast served every day of the week. This is not a continental breakfast (although you can get cereal or bagels if you'd like). They usually have two egg dishes and either bacon, ham or sausage, with potatoes of some sort (on the days they don't have biscuits and gravy!). If you consider the price of feeding a family of 4 both breakfast and dinner, and take that off the price of the room, you'll rapidly figure out that this hotel is a real deal. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The pool, although on the small side, is always stocked with towels and is more than adequate for the size of the hotel. There is a Hilton Garden Inn next door that is affiliated with the Homewood, and they have an absolutely fantastic restaurant, for those nights the Homewood is not serving their \"light meal.\" The location of the hotel is ideal. Even though it appears to be off the beaten path a bit (it's in more of a residential area, which actually makes it very quiet since it's away from the highway), it's actually very close to the beach, Torrey Pines, Legoland, and it's only a 20 minute drive to downtown and Sea World.

It's actually one of the best suite hotels I've stayed in. In fact, the service and room quality has been so superb, I decided to actually write this review as I sit in my room. My wife, daughter (2 years old) and I are down here visiting San Diego and have found this particular Homewood Suites to be the perfect home base for our vacation. ABOUT THE ROOMS: The rooms are all well appointed with tasteful furniture, granite counter tops (in kitchen too), LCD TV's, and pleasant color schemes. We opted for the 1br suite which separates the living area from the bedroom so that we could put our daughter to sleep and then retreat to the bedroom to watch a movie, read a book, and yes... even type this review. The King sized bed is comfortable, though I have to say that the Westin's \"Heavenly Bed\" is better. Pillows are abundant and of varying firmness so you're bound to find one or three that fit. ABOUT THE SERVICE: As I said before, the service has been superb. We unfortunately had to move rooms (see \"GRIPES\" section below) and the staff handled every detail except packing our things. ABOUT THE AMENITIES: The decor is a bit better than you might expect from a rural business-type hotel. There is a business center that has a computer you can use to print whatever you need. A decent little sundries corner where you can charge snacks and other necessities to your room, and a lounge/buffet area that is used to provide guests with complementary breakfasts and even dinners/drinks (through Thursday). The pool is outside and there appears to be a hot tub but I haven't been in either so I couldn't tell you how they are. ABOUT THE PARKING: Free... Abundant. There you go. There was an Embassy Suites around here that was going to charge us $17 a day. Now perhaps it's in a less business-like locale but quite frankly free is better, unless of course you're in a resort, downtown, or on the water. Even then free is better - if you can get it!!! GRIPES: Okay, so enough sunshine... every hotel has its down points. This one appears to be either the elephant that was staying above our room, or the relatively thin walls and noisy floor structure. The person above us stomped around so much that we couldn't get a decent night sleep (he/she apparently woke up around 5am too) and ultimately had to move rooms. It very well could be that that person was just a heavy-footed, rude individual, but judging from the muffled sound of the TV next door to our new room it's probably not the case. All in all you can set the fan to be \"on\" all the time while still maintaining temperature and it creates a nice white noise that pretty much drowns out neighbors (just not the stomping feed above you). My recommendation - GET A ROOM ON THE 4th Floor. One other nit is the fact that in the South wing (4th floor only apparently) the intersperse their smoking and non-smoking rooms. The problem with this is the fact that the smoke smell seeps into the non-smoking rooms leaving them smelling rather rank. We know this to be the case because they moved us to one of those rooms and we had to be instantaneously moved again (the staff was great though... very accommodating). After settling into our \"final\" new-room we learned that the issue isn't a problem in the North wing as it is 100% non-smoking. Second recommendation - GET A ROOM IN THE NORTH WING. That's about all I've got to say. Enjoy your stay and I would certainly recommend this place to a friend.

Extremely clean room...actually super clean hotel. Management seems to be doing a great job. I had actually booked this hotel very far in advance, using the Hilton website. I've never had this happen, but I went ahead and booked using the Advance Savings Rate which required prepayment in advance. Of course, this is one of those rates that cannot be cancelled and/or changed for any reason. Being vigilant, I was just checking the website again about a month before arrival and noticed that the hotel had greatly discounted their rates...my early bird special rate of $179/night was now available at $139/night. I was not pleased, to say the least. Especially since I've never seen a hotel lower it's rate so much that it has been substantially lower than my advance prepaid rate. After much haggling with Hilton Honors, I was able to get a nice customer service person contact the hotel directly -- and they agreed to at least offer me the specials that were running. Granted I did not receive a refund on the difference in the rates, but we did receive two free tickets to Legoland and free in-room movies. I was pleased that the manager was willing to do anything and when we checked in, he was actually there and immediately said they were aware of the issue and no questions asked gave us the tickets and the coupons for the free in-room movies. Breakfast is ample and free -- included Belgian waffles, eggs, potatoes & sausage and/or bacon. Bagels, pastries, granola bars, yogurt, juice, toast and fresh fruit. The folks running the breakfast do a great job, cleaning tables and replenishing the food. Can't complain when it's free and hot. I think Monday - Thursday, they also offer a Manager's Dinner type reception. I don't drink, but there appeared to be wine, and then various offerings for food from 5 - 7 pm. When we were there, the offerings were Swedish Meatballs and then a barbeque on the patio with hots and hamburgers and grilled chicken breasts. Again, it wasn't a full meal, but they had tossed salad, steamed vegetables and wine, lemonade & iced tea. Very nice touch. There are two computers located right off of the lobby and there appeared to be a printer for free. The rooms have easy to connect free internet service and the hotel had free parking. Now that the bypass is finished, the hotel is easily reached right off of I-5 and you can get just about anywhere within 15 - 20 minutes. We'd definitely stay there again when we visit San Diego.", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lakewood, California", "Title": "\u201cVery clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "MHS62", "ReviewID": "UR11086847", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights in November 2007, there were 7 of us.

I have stayed with Hilton worldwide paying 1st class airfares but this is an awful hotel. The hotel has been set up for the benefits of the manager's friends.

I had the misfortune to be evacuated after the San Diego fires. Not only did the manager expect me to pay for the taxi to take me to safety but I was actually charged for the nights accommodation I spent in a shelter (actually under the stars). I am still fighting to get my money back. When I returned to the hotel the staff didn't speak to me, were rude while my room wasn't even serviced.

From the time we arrived to the time we left, we had a nearly perfect stay. Check-in was easy, and since it was dinner time, they gave me a sheet that listed all of the nearby restaurants, including driving directions and a note referencing those that were 'family friendly'. While we ate in restaurants Saturday and Sunday night, Monday through Thursday they provide quite a good dinner, with a rotating menu (such as pizza, chicken Caesar salad, chili with baked potatoes), and complementary wine and locally-brewed Firehouse beer. Breakfast, while not made to order, was quite good, with scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, meat of the day (bacon, sausage or ham), make-your-own waffles, cereal and pastries. Our suite was well-maintained, with the typical Homewood amenities including two-burner stovetop, microwave, full-size refrigerator, small dining table, two TVs, tall showerhead. The bedroom also had a ceiling fan, which I appreciated. Unlike a previous reviewer, I had no problem with noise, either from the street or from the neighboring rooms. A squeaking door was quickly dealt with by maintenance. The business center had two free computers with Internet access. The outside pool water was cold, but the hot tub was refreshingly warm. As for the local restaurants, we tried the Italian restaurant next to the nearby Von's (skip it--overpriced, mediocre food). We also tried the locally-based regional chain Rubio's, which is a fast casual Mexican restaurant known for their fish tacos. All of the food we had there was good--and reasonably priced. Overall, I highly recommend this hotel, particularly to families and to business travelers looking for an 'extended stay' facility.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colusa California", "Title": "\u201cBuild more Homewood Suites!

This suite had a seperate kitchen with stovetop, microwave, full size fridge, cooking utensils, plates, silverware. And the room was big and comfortable, lots of drawers and closet space and my favorite and wish more hotels would do this-cabinets and drawers in the bathroom. I read a negative in another review that the walls are thin and you can hear your neighbors and this is true. I had a crying baby on one side and a very loud man on the other, but the AC fan drowned them out. My only complaint would be the lighting in the seperate shower room, it was pretty dim. But over all it was a very pleasant stay-I could live in that room comfortably! Nice area too, isolated-you don't hear all the traffic.

We found this hotel to be modern and very clean. The staff was very nice, especially the manager. There was a great complimentary breakfast every morning, free newspaper, free parking, free coffee/tea and some fruit available all day long. The hotel is located very conveniently close to I-5, but it is up the hill from the freeway and there is no noise. There was a fire on a construction site beside the hotel a couple of weeks before our stay. It occurred on appoximately June 12, 2007. The hotel next door that was under construction, and soon to be open, completely burned down. This caused some external damage to one of the wings of the Homewood Suites hotel, and some water damage in the suites of that wing. As a result, the hotel closed that wing for renovations. Otherwise, the hotel is fully operational, including the center courtyard, pool, and hot pool. Other than seeing the external damage to the one wing of the hotel as we drove up, nothing bothered us. The hotel was easy to find when travelling from the SAN airport. I suggest following the directions as outlined on the Homewood Suites website: Heading I-5 North - Take local bypass for state highway 56. This is 100 yards past the Sorrento Valley Road exit. Exit Carmel Mountain Road and turn right. Drive one third mile to Vista Sorrento Parkway. Turn right on Vista Sorrento Parkway, drive one half mile to the Pacific Plaza traffic light. Make a U-turn at the traffic light and the hotel will be on your right. These directions are much more accurate than the ones from mapquest. The hotel was a great base for tourists exploring San Diego. An approximately 20 minute drive to San Diego ZOO and Balboa Park, 15 minute drive to Seaworld, 25 minute drive to Coronado, 10 minutes to Del Mar Beach or La Jolla area. Although there are no restaurants next to the hotel, there are restaurants and a Vonns grocery store within a 5 minute drive. Front desk has a very good information sheet with directions.
