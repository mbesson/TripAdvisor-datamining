Residence Palazzo Odoni was the best. The magical city of Venice as a backdrop helps.

The water taxi was an option but overpriced and in the end unnecessary. More stairs to navigate once at the hotel, however Michele was there to help us with the bags. We stayed for four nights in two apartments (Tiziano and Caravaggio) on the last night Caravaggio was unavailable so we moved the kids to Canaletto. All apartments are excellent, very spacious with a kitchenette. The layout in each, quite different. Furnishings nice with modern bathrooms. We loved the area. Very quite with lots of restaurants and shops. We ate a number of the nearby restaurants and eateries. All were good with their own character. It was also nice to grab some supplies from the supermarket or food purveyors and have drinks and snacks in the room after a long day walking, experiencing Venice. We prepared breakfast in the room most mornings, however due to lack of supplies we had breakfast in the restaurant next door on one morning for 5 Euro\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s each \u00e2\u20ac\u201c very basic but fresh.

There is no way to avoid stairs as soon as you get off train. You need to get over main bridge across main canal ...all stairs and than you need to hop over smaller canals on the way to the hotel. A water taxi is expensive but i would've done it to avoid the complaining from my wife & kids. Anyway the hotel is charming and loved the bathroom , but make sure you pick the ones on one level not a split level...we were away from our kids and my wife was worried about the kids climbing the steep stairs at night.

Also, the hotel is 5 minutes to the number 2 (red) line for the canal \"bus\" boats. A great ride through Venice and you end up right at San Marcos area. When we come back to Venice, we will stay at Palazzo Odoni since we found this part of Venice much more authentic than the San Marcos area which is much more touristy. This is definitely the place to stay. Also there is a great restaurant next to the hotel and Palazzo Odoni has agreat map of Venice with 10 suggestions of good restaurants.

It was clean and decorated beautifully, though simply at the same time, including interesting antiques. The bathroom was modern and convenient. We also loved the afternoon sun flooding the bedroom, just begging to open the window and take in the lovely view of the quiet canal and pretty old buildings! The palazzo itself is beautiful, especially the courtyard, which was lit with candles every evening as we returned from our adventures. The location is good, especially if your visit is not tied to St Mark's Square, which is good 20 minutes of brisk walking away. We highly recommend taking the Academia bridge route from the Palazzo to St Mark's instead of going via Rialto Bridge. It really helps avoiding hordes of tourists that flood the path between Rialto Bridge and St Mark's. One of the reasons we preferred staying in Santa Croce is because it is not as touristy and is right next to the Dorsoduro neighborhood, which is even more \"off the beaten path\". It was also convenient to the bus stop, so I believe we only had to take on 2 bridges going to/from the airport with our luggage. Our highest complements go to Michele. He is most gracious and accommodating host. He was always available to us. If he wasn't on the property, all we had to do is call him from our room. Two days in a row we had a hard time getting the restaurant reservations we wanted (beware: a lot of great restaurants in Venice are closed on Sundays and Mondays!) and he went out of his way to try to help us. Michele's recommended restaurant just a few steps from the Palazzo turned out to be our favorite restaurant in Venice.

This establishment offered us the double chance of hotel room and apartment, it seemed very romantic and was very well located, close to the port, bus terminal and train station Santa Lucia. But the real surprise was that, to contact them, Ema Giangreco proved to be a true professional in the organization of weddings, vow renewals and honeymoons. From the beginning, she gave us every facility to book an apartment overlooking the Gaffaro Canal to make it more beautiful, gave us a lot of very interesting suggestions that would be a surprise for the newlyweds on arrival, with a very warm treatment, engaging with genuine interest and enthusiasm in hosting the couple with flowers, toasts, breakfast in the garden and a lot of remarkable details. As a perfect ending to the stay, she hired a gondola ride ending at La Fenice Restaurant, where they had reserved a table for a romantic dinner at candlelight. And all for a really balanced price. Venecia is not a cheap city, but we came out better than doing it on our own and better than other hotels we had looked. The Giangreco know how to convey the spirit of Venice to lovers and have always been willing to help in whatever they needed during their stay. Our friends have been happy to have lived an experience they will never forget, and we have been great with such a personal attention. Do not hesitate, if you want a special place for a special occasion, choose the Palazzo Odoni. In addition to its many conveniences and comforts, will make your stay an unforgettable experience.

We walked from the train station and although we got lost, the locals knew the residence and gave great directions. Although it is close to the train station, it is far enough so that you get immersed in the Venetian life style from the start. With a very unpretentious gate, you ring the door bell and Michele greets you and leads you through the most amazing courtyard. The staircase leads you into a building that is what you imagine a 5th generation Venice villa. Our apartment was a large one bedroom unit with a living area that could be closed into another sleeping area with a large curtain. There was a nice kitchen with a large table and a huge modern bathroom with a jacuzzi tub/shower and bidet. The decor was again what you would expect of an antique building, and yet with all modern amenities and very clean. At night candles lined the courtyard and the staircase creating an absolutely romantic setting. Whenever we opened the gate to enter or leave the apartment, people outside would look in with the same awe we felt when we arrived.

The maid came in every day to clean and tidy up. There was a whirlpool bath and a good shower. Everything was sparkling clean. We had the option of shutters and windows open, to listen to the day and nightlife of a backstreet canal in Venice. However, when both were closed, the room was almost completely silent. I saw a criticism of the access from the street in a previous review. Yes, there are a number of steps to get to reception, and yes they are quite steep. However, if you are staying at a hotel, away from the main 'bustle' of the touristy centre, you will have to walk over many bridges. We are in our late fifties, and managed perfectly well, and feel much fitter because of the experience.

At the time of the booking, the owner did not specify that the hotel is divided in two different businesses - a B&B/hotel and the Residence which is apartments. Hence, when we had an issue with the missing baby crib and poorly managed utensil, we reported the issue with the staff at the reception. The staff rudely said that he could not help us with any one of the amenities of the apartment because he looks after the hotel requirements. Later on when we communicated the issue with the owner through e-mail because we did not have any phone in the apartment, and our phones were out of charge, the owner seemed very angry with the idea of sending him an e-mail. He said he would have liked if we have reported the issue when he was around. But we noticed that issue around 7:00 pm in the evening, and he was not around at that time. Later on the next day we went again in the morning to talk to him directly. We could not find him. As soon as we stepped out of the hotel, my son fell down on the streets, and he was bleeding on his mouth. We immediately went back to the apartment to look out for the owner or somebody who can help us with his bleeding. The owner was nowhere to be found. Later on one of the cleaning ladies helped us clean my son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bleeding. Later on when we talked to the owner about our issues, he was not at all ready to listen to us, and kept on showing his disappointment with the e-mail. When we told him about our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mishap, he was rude and said we could have gone to pharmacist, which is two blocks from the apartment. He was not all kind, and did not show any empathy. Thanks to that cleaning lady who helped us. However there was no first aid box in the hotel. Also, some of the hotel staff was also kind. One of them helped us carry our luggage down to the apartment door early in the morning. There is no printer the hotel, and nobody provided us any information about the nearby attractions. We had been in so many hotels since the time when we arrived in Europe, and we have been welcomed with the information booklet, and necessary information about the surroundings that we expected the same with Residence Palazzo. But, when we asked, we were told to consult the information center, which is supposed to be close to the hotel. The controls for Jacuzzi in the room were not functioning properly. Once in ten times it used to work. We had been very disappointed with the owner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s behavior and his negative receptiveness to our concerns, so we did not take pains to report this issue. However, the owner did seem slightly concerned when he in the response of my e-mail, asked me to keep the windows open (in the chilling weather) while cooking to avoid causing any inconvenience to others. But it seemed more of retaliation to my e-mail than a concern for the neighbors. We do appreciate the owner for carrying our luggage up to the apartment when we arrived. We had cancelled our booking in one of the prestigious hotels located in Grand Canal at the same rate that was offered to us by the owner because of the low season. However, the owner kept on mentioning about the low rate he offered us in the e-mail. We are not fools enough to know that almost all the hotels were offering the discounted rate in low season. After talking to the owner, we regretted the idea of cancelling our previous booking. We had an issue with carrying our luggage to the apartment. Even though it is close from railway station, but it can be a major hassle if you are carrying heavy luggage and if you could not get any help from anyone to carry your luggage across the bridge.

Make sure you organise breakfast day before - we didn't but no drama's we went to a local patisserie.

Our apt. had a gorgeous view of the canal(the owner kindly up-graded us since it was our 25th wedding anniversary!), was beautifully decorated with fine antiques, venetian plaster walls and had a well equipped kitchen.

Due to luggage volume of 2 adults + 2 kids, the location to Piazale Roma was the initially the reason for booking this apartment. We were pleasantly surprised once we turned into the quiet side street, rang a non-descript door bell and stepped into a beautiful courtyard. We were greeted warmly by the young owner, Michele, who graciously allowed our tired family to check in early both times once the rooms were ready. He also let us stored our extra bags for no charge while we were on the cruise. The apartment was done in beautiful Venetian style and I was particularly impressed with the Venetian plaster on the walls. Great air conditioning as the outside was extremely humid and muggy. The large bathtub was the highlight of the apartment. Michele recommended a wonderful restaurant (Restaurant Ribot) 100 yards to the right of the hotel. In the other direction approx. 500 yards was a delicious bakery.

The Residence Palazzo Odoni was perfect.. We along with family and friends stayed at the Residence Palazzo Odoni for four incredible days. From the moment you walk throught the hugh wooded doors into the stone courtyard you feel a sense of romance and history. The owners Michele and Ema and staff greet you as if you were an old friend who has come to visit. The palace is just as shown on the website with murano chandeliers, elegant decor and modern amenities. But it's so much more. The apartments decorated in beautiful antiques,and art work make for a warm and inviting retreat. The fresh flowers enhance the welcome as if you were staying at a dear friends home. The views of the canal below just take your breath away. The staff are kind and thoughtful, passionate about making your visit to Venice and Palazzo Odoni wonderful. Ema the owners wife made all the arrangement for my wedding in the courtyard and reception and at Ribo's Restaurant steps from the Palazzo Odoni. The only thing I had to do was select the menu and flowers. She created a wedding venue that was both beautiful and mystical. The reception was elegant and romantic. Being serenaded in the garden by venetian musician, I was in complete awe. The owners Ema and Michele and staff at Residence Palazzo Odoni cater to you as if you were royality. And experience I will never forget. This is an amazing place. I cherish my new found friends in Venice and intend to return often.
