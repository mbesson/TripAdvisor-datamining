We enjoyed the low occupancy (just missed the weekend crowd that came in just as we're leaving). The pool was very nice - everything was what you saw on the website. Spa and food is very cheap in the hotel. The theme dinner is done in candle light at the restaurant or poolside tables under the frangipani trees.Rooms are minimalist with concrete structures for beds and side tables. A wooden daybed accomodates a 3rd person. Rooms upstairs is private and lower floor gets access directly to the pool.Only thing is it's wooden sliding shower doors may need to be replaced by material more resilient to moisture than wood. And the place is very hidden from the main road - the entrance is a narrow elusive alley.", "Date": "Jan 21, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR240227003", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "kicking_asphalt"}, {"Content": "Basic hotel with excellent pool Oasis Kuta is a 70-room, 2 star hotel. It is cheap and is conveniently located at Kuta area with around 10 minutes walk to Kuta beach. I stayed here in 2004 and stayed there again in September 2007 for our honeymoon. The hotel is not very old as evidenced by its minimalist architecture.The main attraction of this hotel is its 50m lap pool. At first I did not believe that so I counted the tiles and it measured 50m indeed. For those who love swimming, the 50m pool is undeniably very appealing. As an Asian who does not like to get tanned, I particularly like the pool as it is relatively shaded by the hotel buildings and the frangipani trees. So for those who may want to relax and do the sunbathing, the pool is not the ideal place. Room size is just adequate. Room is minimalist design. Bed is comfortable. Shower room is very small (a bit difficult to change clothes) but considering its cheap price, I don\u9225\u6a9b bother. No bath tub. Depending on availability, you may be located on the ground floor room so you have access to the pool just in front of your door.We did not interact much with the staff but we did not have any complaints with the service. Check in and check out process is fast.Breakfast is buffet style. They do not have many varieties (due to small number of rooms) but the breakfast was quite tasty and fulfilling. Fried noodle, sausages, some breads and fruits. Juices, coffee and tea are also provided.The main disadvantage of this hotel is its gate entrance. The entrance is very small that it was very difficult for a typical car to get in to the hotel (you have to fold both of side mirrors). So if you rent a car, DO NOT book this hotel. This hotel is best suited for budget travelers.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR343028479", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "PMUL74"}, {"Content": "Filthy bathroom, grey linen       Nice pool though", "Date": "Sep 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR926652273", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "runninggirlMelbourne"}, {"Content": "Dim and Drab My stay in Oasis was definitely not love at first sight. The hotel is not visible from the main road. You have to walk through a back alley. When i saw the reception or lobby area, my heart sank. It was dimly lit and it didn't resemble a hotel lobby at all. It was neither clean nor inviting. So different from the photographs shown by the agent. Only the pool area was similar to the photographs. The staff were ok though they can be quite stingy. We were only provided with toiletries for the first day. They don't replenish it daily. You have to request for these items daily if you want them. The room is badly lit. The toilet doors cannot be locked. If you sit on the toilet seat, it moves forward. V'ery badly maintained. Insects will be crawling around.

The hotel's location was excellent and the staff were very firendly and helpful. The rooms were quite nice with a clean, large bed. Ground floor rooms had access to the pool via sliding doors and first floor rooms had their own private balcony overlooking the pool.The rooms and bathrooms were cleaned daily, however, the shower room was in need of some renovation (door and shower floor was in need of replacment). Breakfast varied daily and usually consisted of tea/coffee/juice/water, bread/pastries/crossiants/cakes, noodle/rice dishes, fresh fruit and eggs cooked the way you like.Overall if your looking for a hotel with a location close to kuta square and waterbom park at a reasonable price - then this is for you.

The hotel itself didn't look as good as the pictures in the brouchere depicted. The rooms are very dark with poor lighting and gaps in the doors meant mosquitos entered the room easily. We were bitten everynight and had to spray our room before we slept. Our room was also broken in to whilst we were at the pool and money was taken from wallets, as well as my partners PDA and charger. We are assuming it was staff as the room had been locked and they would have had to have a key to enter. We kicked up a fuss and demanded to see the manager. It was Bali New Year and after waiting for hours for the manager to show up, nobody came. The staff ignored us for the rest of our saty (2 days). Upon leaving they were quite rude and didnt offer us any form of compensation or show the slightest bit of concern as to what had happened. This was disappointing and dampened our spirits and overall view of our stay at the Oasis.

The breakfasts were fine- fresh fruit, eggs to order - I like the omelettes which were custom made and very quickly. I did not try most of the hot food-mostly personal taste but noted that others seemed to enjoy it-and it changed daily so the menu was varied. However we did not eat any other meals at the hotel.The problems were: rooms were awkward- one closet to put clothes in but it wasn't user friendly so we hung a few things and everything else stayed in the suitcase-digging through to find what you want gets old after a few days - especially since the lighting was extremely poor- you did most things in the dark. We had a ground floor room so almost no daylight came into the room. There were two quite useless lamps on the wall beside each bed-could not read as they blocked most of the light they gave off with a rather unattractive metal shade that was not flexible enough. The rooms did not seem very clean but it was hard to tell in the dark. There was a light near the sliding doors to the patio but it only provided light to one slice of the room-right by the door. There were bug problems, spiders that bite, cockroaches in the rooms ( well it is a tropical climate so the cockroaches can be hard to manage). The wild cats left a mess everywhere so it was hard to sit around the pool. The hotel allowed hawkers into the pool so we were bothered there as well. And if you walk out the alley from the hotel it was a virtual assault-hawkers from the shops, transport drivers, taxi drivers, fake nail sellers.....well it was constant, aggressive, endless and after a week absolutely exhausting. We started taking taxis short distances so we could go to lunch or dinner without the hassle. We changed hotels after the first week and the new hotel had the hawker issue, but much less prominent.I would not stay at the Oasis nor would I recommend it to anyone else unless they clean it up and put lights, lots of lights in the rooms. I have stayed in some interesting hotels over the years but this was the dirtiest I experienced. Oh yes, and 4 requests for an extra towel, 4 promises to deliver-no luck-two grey threadbare towels for 2 people are not enough.", "Date": "May 16, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR602944785", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Hereandtherelife"}, {"Content": "Bed spiders at the Oasis, Kuta, Bali It looks nice but If you want to be bitten by tiny bed spiders, stay at the Oasis, Kuta, Bali. I was eaten alive by the tiny things - my legs itched in bed at night and at first I thought it was mosquitos but later found out it was spiders - other guests had the same problem. The sheets were whitish grey/stained and we suspect were recycled due to fresh stains - and the blankets were stained with holes in. We were given one towel each - sometimes very damp. I had to ask quite a few times for an additional pillow. We had a very small low-light bed lamp which was nigh impossible to read by. However, the breakfast was great. The pool was lovely. There were several very sick ferral cats around the place - which pooped on the lounge chairs etc. It is a centrally located hotel - right outside were hawkers which pestered us everytime we walked by. We met 6 other people who decided to move hotels because of the spiders, sheets, cats and noise - we followed them to the Febri's - which was the newest hotel in Kuta.

We had enough room, using the adjoining room door area, for our 4 large suitcases. It's worth noting that the rooms are very poorly lit, there's only weak side lamps on either side of the bed. The bathroom is divide into a huge shower (good hot water  water pressure), a tiny vanity area with nowhere much to put toiletries, and a tiny loo. We had a ground floor room which opened onto a tiny deck and then down a couple of steps to the pool. The pool is long  narrow  we quite liked it. There are some tiles missing at the mid-point of the pool, but it was otherwise clean  well maintained, as were the small bits of garden around the hotel.The breakfast was fine as long as you were happy to have fruit  toast because the hot food was dreadful, as was the coffee. It's included in the price  is enough to get you going for the day. Because the hot food was so bad we weren't tempted to have any other meals in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options around.You have to go down the tiniest lane to get to the hotel - plenty of room to walk, but an inch either side of the mirrors in a 4 wheel drive - the kids thought it was hilarious.We would stay there agagin but mainly because it's so very cheap  the staff are lovely.", "Date": "Apr 8, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR377203776", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Dromomaniac"}, {"Content": "Fabulous I have travelled all over the world and this is one of my favourite hotels.

The pool is lovely and your patio windows lead directly from the back of your room to your own sunbeds next to the pool. Breakfast is a wide range of hot and cold dishes both indonesian and western style. Service was wonderful and every afternoon they would serve complimentary tea and cakes by the pool.
