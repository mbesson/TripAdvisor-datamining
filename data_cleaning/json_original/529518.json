This time I stayed for 4 nights between 15th and 19th December and paid 150 Euros which included breakfast. The hotel occupies 2 floors, the second and fourth, within a typical European building. You have to ring the door bell to gain access, then take the quaint old wooden lift to the second floor for the reception area. I arrived at the hotel early but I was able to check in immediately with the minimum of fuss. The reception staff were friendly and eager to help with information, maps, tickets etc. I was given room number one on the 4th floor. I was given 2 keys; one for the door at street level and the other which opened both my room and the door to the 4th floor; this made me wonder whether all the rooms could be opened with the same key. Despite this possible security issue I felt safe within the hotel. The room was clean but could do with being painted. It was quite large with a desk, 2 chairs, a couple of bedside tables and a wardrobe. I had booked a single room but this one was set up as a double with 2 single matresses contained within a double bed frame; but only a single duvet was provided. There was also a small television with lots of German channels; the only non German channel I found was CNN. The bathroom was OK but I found the 6 inch step from the main bedroom into the bathroom and then another large step up into the shower to be a bit unnecessary. I also discovered that I had to let the water run for 4 or 5 minutes before it became hot. Breakfast was served in a large room on the 4th floor. It the usual European fayre; breads, cold meats, cheeses, pickles, eggs, yoghurts, fruit, cereal, coffee,tea and fruit juice. The hotel is located on a side street about 20 yards from Kurfurstendamm with all its shops and transport connections. It is conveniently situated for the bus from Tegel airport but is less convenient for most tourist sights however these can be easily reached by public transport. The hotel is clean on the surface but when looked at a bit closer it is clear that the whole building could do with rennovation.

Many pros and cons. Location: In West Germany's traditional shopping district. If you're like me, and prefer to spend more on shopping than hotels, this is a perfect location. On a side street off Ku'damm, so you've got Hublot, Louis Vuitton, Valentino on the block. Even a Prada-in-process right next door to the hotel. Public Transportation: The 109 bus stops a block away, providing a direct line (~25 minutes) to Tegel Airport. In the other direction, the 109 will take you (<10 minutes) to the Bahnhof Zoo, from which you can get just about any bus, S-Bahn or U-Bahn, including the much-loved 100 and 200 cross-town busses. Other busses that stop one block from the hotel include the M19 and M29, which (among other places) go directly past the KaDeWe. Elevator: Small old-fashioned lift, worked fine when I was there. WiFi: Available at 1 euro per hour. You pay at the front desk and get a password (in 1 hour increments). Pretty reliable in the time I was there. Breakfast: When I booked and checked in, the hotel indicated breakfast was included in the price. However, on my bill checking out, it is listed separately at 5 euro per day. This did not increase my room price, instead the room price listed was 5 euro less. Unfortunately, I never quite got up early enough to try the breakfast -- it was served from 7:30-10am. Passed by the breakfast room frequently, though, and it looked quite spacious and very nice. Rooms: I booked a single, was given a \"double\" bed (2 twin mattresses inside a double frame with a double sheet). Of course, this means you need to beware of sleeping on that middle crease. Aside from the bed, there was a fairly nice armoire with full-length mirror (nice addition), small television (over 2 dozen channels -- 1 in French, a BBC, CNN, and the rest German), small desk and chair, and en suite bathroom with toilet and shower. There are some rooms without en suites, as I saw the communal shower and WC in the hallway; these looked clean but creepy and I'm glad I did not have to use. Drapes were very thin and did not cover over entire window; because the building is shaped like a courtyard, I was in the awkward position of trying to avoid being seen by the across-the-way neighbors through the window. The room has 2 radiators and in theory you could adjust the heat, but in my 3 nights there I was never able to get it very warm. The duvet provided was sufficient, however. Service: Friendly front desk staff. I arrived around 11am (4 hours before check-in), and was given a room right away. Spoke good (not perfect) English, without my having to ask gave me maps and pointed out how to get to various suggested locations. Stored my luggage securely in the office the day I checked out. Housekeeping was not so friendly and spoke limited English. I mostly think I was bothering them by leaving each day so early (they wanted to get into the room and do their jobs). Building: I had never stayed in a Pension before. This is basically 3 floors of a larger building that has residences and offices. When you arrive, you need to ring the Hotel buzzer to gain access to the building, then take the lift up to the 2nd floor to reception. My room was on the 4th floor. You are given 2 keys -- one for the building and the other for your room. Despite the issues with the window (see above), I felt perfectly safe in the hotel. So, if you've read this far ... would I stay here again, or recommend to a friend? Perhaps, if other accommodations were not available or too pricey. The specific deal-breaker cons: - No hot water. I tried, honestly I did, but I never could get the water in either the sink or shower to get above tepid. This was regardless of the time (even waking at 6:00am to beat the rush). - Hard beds. So this is not news for Europe, but for some reason these were extraordinarily hard. Maybe it's just coincidence, but I woke up the first morning with a tremendous backache that only got worse each night. I am positive it is because of the bed. - Sour experience during checkout. I mentioned that the reception staff is friendly, and for the most part I was pleased. However, during check out, the front desk agent purposely withheld my change (a minor amount, 6 euro), but it really rubbed me the wrong way. He gave me the bill for 94 euro and when I paid with 100 euro cash, he simply took it and turned away, not even given the pretense that he would get me change. Like I said, it was a minor amount, but it rubbed me the wrong way, especially when combined with the bill itself which made it seem that breakfast (which I did not have on any day) was a separate charge. If you can overlook those last 3 issues, I think Hotel Kima Pension is a fine place to stay, and definitely a great bargain.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't recommend it to anyone\u201d", "Author": "Karleriksen", "ReviewID": "UR91661758", "Content": "I was forced to cancel my stay with this hotel due to unforeseen events at work.

We each had different interpretations of the cancellation terms. I cancelled at a date where I believed I should not have been charged; the hotel thought I was liable to pay for the full rate because of a special exemption period. Regardless of who was right or wrong, the hotel approached the whole dispute in a way which was rigid and extremely unhelpful. Clearly the Hotel Kima does not believe that \"the customer is always right\"; they seem to feel, at least in my case, that the customer's views should not be considered at all. Over the course of the dispute, they repeatedly refused to address the multiple specific issues I raised about contradictions in the cancellation terms; offered no compromises or suggestions of ways to resolve the dispute; did not acknowledge or respond to a compromise I proposed; and even suggested they could charge me full price for a night which fell outside the special exemption period. They made no concession to the idea that I might in any way be justified in my interpretation, instead implying that I was obtuse (they said 99% of their customers understand their terms). When I decided to dispute the charge with my credit card company and ultimately post my story here, they accused me of not fairly representing their views, even though I had repeatedly tried to see things from their perspective: in the end in fact, as I told them, I understood why they believed in their interpretation of the terms - but I also felt strongly that the terms were contradictory and that my interpretation was absolutely justified.

There is a nice irish bar nearby (found it by accident)....turn left on Ku Damm,then right at the next junction and its 5 min walk.its a lot cheaper than the one in the europer center. ps my wife loved the authentisity of the lift", "Date": "December 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Little Gem\u201d", "Author": "anchel79", "ReviewID": "UR51548888", "Content": "Hotel Kima is a fantastic hotel central to Berlin. Our room was large, clean and bright. There was a wardrobe, desk and Television. The beds were very comfortable and the room was amazingly quiet. The hotel is in a great location, a short bus ride from Zoologischer Garten station. The surrounding area is a incredible shopping district with premium brands like Burberry, Rolex and Bvulgari. The check-in desk staff were lovely and very helpful in planning our sightseeing, providing advice on what to see and transport. They provide a traditional continental breakfast of cold meat, cheeses, cereal, tea, coffee and juice. Quite a good spread when compared to what I have received in similar Pensions across Europe. The only negative about the hotel was the cold. We stayed in a very cold snap and for some reason the heating wasn't on. It eventually came on in the morning around 10 am - just as we were leaving for the day sightseeing! My advice is that if you do stay in during colder weather to make sure you have warm PJ's! A great place to stay in Berlin, and is good value for money.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Midlands", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Missithompson", "ReviewID": "UR49991317", "Content": "This is a little gem.

Nobody's fault really - things break sometimes.
