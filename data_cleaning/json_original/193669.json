I was traveling to London and later Paris, alone, to celebrate my birthday. What a mistake to choose the Tria! My threadbare, single room was drafty because of a broken window in the bathroom, and, worse yet, stone-cold the three nights I was there. I eventually came to understand that the desk clerk(s) controlled the thermostat for the entire hotel. (Perhaps this is standard in budget European hotels?) When the lobby was warm, she or he would turn down the thermostat. It was cold and rainy in London that week, and I am fortunate I didn't catch pneumonia. Since I had to block the cold coming in from the bathroom window with one of the two towels they provided me, I had to ask for a clean bath towel each day, which I was given reluctantly. The breakfast was adequate, because having been to London before, I knew I was in store for cereal, toast, and coffee. The desk clerks weren't rude, exactly, but they exuded a \"I don't care\" attitude. They also misled me about the use of the phone in my room -- although I had a calling card, I still had to pay connection fees and a non-refundable deposit. None of the clerks I encountered were British. Just as miserable as the hotel was the seedy neighborhood in which it is located. I don't know if it was because of construction, or because late November is the off-season for tourists, the well-recommended Indian restaurant and Italian bistro just a couple of streets over from the Tria were closed. And, the Tube station closest to the Tria, Westbourne Park, had no security guards (or even ticket-sellers that I could see). The walk to it was a little hairy, again because of the renovation of apartment buildings and empty storefronts. There was nothing open in the Tria's neighborhood at night, unless you count the Pizza Hut, a package store, and one smoky pub. Again, I understand this area is undergoing gentrification, which accounts for the construction and closed storefronts.

What the hotel lacks in wall thickness (it was a tad noisy from other guests coming in late from the pubs on Saturday night) it completely made up for in charm, location and ease of transportation. There's a bus stop just a few steps away that is used by six different busses. For my family, the Tria filled our needs well. We were gone from the room exploring the city most of the day and the beds were comfy, so it filled our simple needs perfectly. Although I'd read a few complaints about Tria's breakfast, I enjoyed it. The morning staff, mostly comprised of young French women, efficiently served the juice, coffee, tea, cereal, milk and toast in the breakfast room. Often, we chatted with other guests. The arrangement of the room promotes that kind of interaction. We picked up a small wheel of delicious brie at Portobello Road Market, nearby the hotel, to supplement our brekkies and stored it on the window sill at night to keep it cool. That made for a lovely start to the day. The staff was multi-cultural and pleasant, but not extremely knowledgeable about bus routes, etc. If you buy an Oyster card, you can use all of London's extremely efficient means of transportation without having to buy individual trip tickets. Ask the locals at the stop where the bus goes until you get used to it. There were plenty of good places in the neighborhood to eat, but one I was particularly impressed with was Star of Bombay. Also, the fish and chips at the Metro Pub, right next to Westbourne Park Tube Station, is some of the best I've had in London.

First of all, we enjoyed our stay and the hotel was perfectly ok! We've booked the room on the internet, via [...] - where you pay only a small amount to secure your booking, and the rest is paid directly in the hotel. Also, the price in this site was quite small - only 42.73 pounds a day (for 2 people + continental breakfast). It is a small hotel, located on a very quiet street and overlooking a small park. It is 5 minutes by foot from the nearest tube (Westbourne Park station), and you can get to a station with better choice of tube lines by bus just outside the hotel (every 5 minutes, a 5 minutes bus ride to Notting Hill Gate station). It is also in a walking distance from Paddington train station. The hotel overall is very clean, and it's a non-smoking hotel, which was very fine with us. The only place where smoking is allowed is in the lobby. In the lobby, there is a soft-drinks machine, a place to sit (sofas, TV and such), internet (0.5 pound for 0.5 hour), and a place where you can prepare tea and coffee (for free). There is also a safe deposit box that cost us only 3 (or 5???????????) pounds for all our stay. The room: of course it wasn't big, but for 2 persons it was fine. There are nice claret-colored carpets on the floor, and the mattresses have just been replaced with new ones (it happened during our stay). A mirror has also been added above the desk (although still a lamp lacks above it to turn it to a dressing table). I think the total room (including the en-suite shower) was around 3x5 meters. In the room there were: a double bed, a big wardrobe with mirrors as doors, a small writing desk (2 drawers and a bigger compartment) with a small lamp, a chair, a \"trouser press\" (a strange machine that presses and heats trousers - to replace ironing; didn't venture to use this thing, though), a TV set+remote, a telephone (we didn't try to call from it, but we did receive a call), and 2 glasses. There was no tea/coffee tray in the room. There is no air conditioning, which can be a problem in the summer. There is a small air-opening in the window (which can be closed), and it was enough for ventilation, most of the time of our stay. The shower looks pretty new and nice, there is also a toilet, and a washing basin (with one tap and hot-cold water mixer, and not 2 taps as it is in many places in England). In the shower: 2 big towels, 2 towel pegs, a feet towel, soap, hairdryer, a place to plug a shaver in. No hand towels, no shampoo. There was continental breakfast included, consisting of (and only): a small glass of orange juice, tea/coffee, milk, a bowl of cornflakes, 2 toasts, jam, butter. We did occasionally ask and get more toasts. Overall it was enough for us for a light breakfast. There wasn't any alteration in the food, except one-time different type of cornflakes. On the whole, the food wasn't anything incredible, but it was all fresh and I'd say usual. The breakfast room is in the basement but it has windows, and doesn't look dark at all. Tips: Remember to bring the special electricity plug for the UK sockets.
