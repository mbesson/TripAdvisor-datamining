Our room (we paid a bit more for superior) was lovely with a huge bathroom but it was a bit tight space wise after they put up a camp bed for our son. The beds were so comfy!!! We chose this hotel purely for the swimming pool and in doing so paid more. The pool area was nice but rather small with too few sun beds, if you arrive in the afternoon you won't get a space. As other people point out the pool loses the sun late afternoon which is probably why it is rather cold. Although this hotel is close to retiro park we felt it was a bit far away certainly from the old town and did not find good inexpensive places to eat in the vicinity so ended up getting the metro to Sol or Opera in the evening. We opted not to pay the extra 19 euro each for breakfast so cannot comment on that. The hotel bar was extortionate, having stayed at another hotel in Madrid at the start of our trip and just eating and drinking generally in the city we know it wasn't good value, but that's 5 star hotels for you I suppose.

We booked a Superior Double, which supposedly are upgraded to a modern style compared to the standard rooms. But sadly most of the changes are cosmetic. The corridors reminds me of scenes from Addams family. - The double bed we had were way too small, we're not big people. So we had to change to a twin room.

Our stay was a mix of business and recreation. We did ask for a \"quiet room, non smoking\". Upon checking in, everything looked perfect, although we were on a smoking floor. But the room was nice and very spacious. The first night we had a lot of noise around 4-6am as our room was obvioulsy very close to the employees wardrobe or some other service room. The next day we asked for a more quiet room and this was no problem. The new room was a bit smaller, higher floor, but smoking room again. Anyway, the initial smoking smell we covered quickly with our own (my wife's nice perfume) and the following two nights we slept without problem. The internet service is a bit old fashioned. We had the internet included in our package, but we had to ask for a new access and re-enter the code every 24 hours. And it allowed only one work-station to be active simultaneously...

The fitness centre is well equiped, clean and spacious. The staff at the recpetion and room-cleaning are all very friendly and helpful.

The staff are all terrific, helpful, friendly and efficient. The rooms are well appointed and comfortable.\u00a0 Breakfast (22\u20ac) with no a la cart available, is held in a dedicated room and the buffet is huge and a perfect way to start the day, with the following caveat: if you love coffee, get it somewhere else. It seems to me that a hotel that is this expensive could find a good coffee machine. Wait! Go to the \"Llaves de Oro\" cafeteria on the property. Good coffee by Spanish standards, but no food beyond rolls (many varieties) or maybe an edible but not exciting sandwich. \u00a0They open at 8:00. \u00a0BTW... It's \u00a0a cafeteria in name only... Just a limited menu restaurant. Don't eat there except in an extreme calorie emergency.\u00a0 For foodies, there is an amazing restaurant on the property... Goizeka. It is, sorry to say, tr\u00e9s expensif... Errr... \"muy caro\", but happy to say tr\u00e9s amazing.... Errr... \"Fabuloso.\" Worth every penny. The wine list is mostly Spanish wines and about a hundred pages long. (Spanish wines are seriously underrated. Delicious. The Rioja wines are the most famous, but also try the Riberas.) The wait staff is there the second before you know you need them and the food is brilliant. Americans should go early (8:00 is early)\u00a0as much to get acclimated to the late dinner times as to see the parade of beautiful people coming in. Our meal lasted 'til almost\u00a011:00. We were the first to leave. \u00a0Families with children showed up as late as 9:30. No kids? Even later. It was our lot to be among the earliest to eat every night... Frankly, I don't know how they do it, but they all seem to take it in stride. It's \"normal.\" Yes, there are some flaws at the Wellington so lets get to them.\u00a0 1. I don't like starched sheets. They are lovely but just not to my liking. I've never had a desire to sleep on sandpaper.\u00a0Hey... I'm a hedonist. 2. The pillows are way too big and overstuffed... Again, beautiful to look at, but not comfortable. Take your own. (As a dedicated hedonist, I always do, just in case.) 3.\u00a0I'm an early riser so I had to walk two blocks to \"Cafe y Te\" for my morning coffee, which was actually a good thing because I got to see the locals on their way to (or from) work, and listen in on their conversations. (It was probably the best coffee of the trip.) It was fun watching the young office workers having coffee and pastries as well as the late shift people having beer and pizza on their way home after a long night - all there at the same time.\u00a0 4. We have to renew our wifi passwords every 24 hours. Really? What a waste. Also, their wifi provider is \"kube\" and the signal was often weak, and would almost as often just quit and we would have to get new passwords. Worst of all is that my wife and I each have an iPhone and an iPad and we were allowed only one device on the system at a time per room. Time to upgrade your system, Wellington! This ain't the Holiday Inn. 5. We wanted to buy a bottle of water in the library area (after several glasses of wine) to take to our room and were told we had to get it from room service. Huh? Get a grip Wellington. To be fair, we managed to do it the next evening, but that night I walked a hundred yards to \"Llaves.\" 6. There is a large, clear glass door between the bath and toilet areas of the bathrooms. Nice idea in a way and very pretty, but at 3:00 in the morning, it can be a hazard to navigate in limited light. I know this from personal experience. 7. Speaking of bathrooms, the faucets for the sink are directed a bit forward which means that - since the sinks are a bit small - you have to be careful not to turn it on all the way unless you actually enjoy getting your legs wet. (Maybe a thrill for some, I don't know. ) 8. We stayed at the Wellington for a week. They left us the same bathroom glasses every day. Huh? Despite all of the above, \u00a0the Wellington is a nice, if imperfect place to stay. There are lots of places to eat that are walking distance from the Wellington. \u00a0 \"El Alkalde\" is very expensive, but worth trying for the foodies in the house. I'm not sure why our lunch for three was 130\u20ac, but it was excellent. I highly recommend the \"El Colonial de Goya\". The food was delicious, the wait staff and manager very friendly and helpful, and it was almost embarrassingly inexpensive. (Dinner for three with too much (delicious) food was 80\u20ac, including wine.) There are at least five other places within walking distance that looked interesting, but we just didn't have time.\u00a0 \u00a0A tip about tipping in Spain.\u00a0 Unlike the US (or most other countries,) there is nowhere on a charge slip to add a tip.

A 5 star hotel had it not been for some service faults, especially with the final bill: had we not checked carefully we would have paid 100 euros that weren't due! Got no aplogies for that either. We found a very good package offer which included breakfast and spa. LOCATION: located in an elegant part of town, full of high class shops and beautiful buildings. It's quiet and very close to the underground that will easily take you anywhere. The Prado Museum is at a 10 minutes walk and the Retiro Park is even closer. It's not right in the city center though. ROOM: We had a superior room, recently renovated, very charming and perfectly comfortable. No noise came from the street (quiet and with triple glass windows). But one night we heard some annoying music coming from upstairs, so the room is not totally sound proof. FOOD: Breakfast was quite good as far as quality of food, coffee and service is concerned (scrambled eggs, sausages, salmon, ham, cheese, toasts). May be there could be a vaster variety of food to choose from Room service was a mess: we chose to have brunch in the room and although the order was for two, they only came with one glass and cuttlery for one. The omelette was the worse ever tasted: no taste at all. The hotel also has a very good restaurant. Dinner there is not cheap (150 euros for two) but the food was very good, the atmosphere and the service were not too formal but attentive. Careful to allergies too. The caf\u00e9 serves light lunches: service there is careless. We ordered sparkling water and they brought it still, I specified three times that I am celiac and must not have bread with the ham I ordered, needless to say they arrived with a dish of ham covered by bread. Worse of all the waiter said he would pull it off! I had to follow him and make sure he'd prepare a new plate without contamination of bread (which could kill a celiac, so it's no joke). SPA: small but pleasent. The girl at the reception is very kind and willing to help. They provided a bathing suite since I had forgotten mine hairdresser, not too kind but the outcome was professional. SERVICE: just about sufficient but not as kind and efficient as one would expect in a 5 star hotel. This would only be a minor nuisance had it not been for two facts: I tried to hire an Ipad for one day. It took endless tries to get it working (first they said they would send it to my room, then they called back saying I had to go downstairs to sign the contract, then I went willing to pay cash but it was impossible, they wanted a credit card-although I had left one for their garantee, when they finally gave me the Ipad, I found out it wasn't working. I called back and they said they had forgotten to give me the access code, couldn't do it by phone, had to go back. I go back and they can't work out how to make it work. I get annoyed so they suggest they'd work on it and then call me back. In the end they apologized and made up for the nuisance letting me use it a second day for free). But what bothered me the most was the bill at the end of the stay: they charged us 100 euros for breakfast and another couple of things that were not due. I told them that breakfast was included in our package and proved them the other costs were a mistake too. They took them off but without apologies nor explanations of their mistake, which left us with an uncomfortable feeling and some doubts. All in all it is a good standard hotel, in a good area of Madrid.

As of 2010 it is the only bar in Madrid capable of presenting you with a perfect Martini (steered, never shaken).

If, on the other hand, you just like sushi you will be disappointed for it is fancy and expensive. Consistent with its MICHELIN star rating. The we get to to the rooms. They are ample and elegant like the rest of the hotel building. Unfortunately, this an old building with lots of limitations and inconveniences which derive from a combination of age and poor maintenance. Our room was so hot during the first night that I simply couldn't sleep. We tried adjusting the temperature by operating the thermostat to no avail. Remember, this is a monarchy. Old and out of touch with the times. The rooms have a separate heating and AC system and the only way to lower the room temperature that night was to open the window.

The chef's were constantly checking food and more than happy to comply with personal requests (the family seated near to us were brought freshly cooked churros on request). The location in my opinion is excellent. Retiro Park is only a block away.We spent Sunday in the park,it's and excellent family day out with live music in the bandstand and lots to see(highly recommended). A taxi to Plaza Mayor from outside the hotel costs 7 euros with a tip included,or there is a Metro station within a few hundred yards and all journeys cost 1 (yes one!) euro to any destination. Being a veteran of city breaks (been to virtually every major european capital and then some) I was impressed with Madrid,it retains some authenticity and has not \"sold out\" simply to cater for tourists in the way other cities have. But back to the Welllington,why no five stars ? We would have loved to use the bar/ lounge area but cocktails/drinks are massively over priced (in my humble opinion) and during our stay there did not seem to be many guests indulging.

We had been in Madrid earlier in the week, loved the Salamanca neighborhood, but weren't excited about our first hotel. While out on a walk, we passed the Wellington and a few days later, made a reservation on-line. The location is terrific -- close enough to walk to the Retiro or art museums and since we enjoy walking, we easily walked to the Plaza Mayor and Palace one day. The neighborhood is lovely, lots of smaller streets with trees, beautiful shops, plenty of dining options. We far preferred this location to being right by the museums or Puerta del Sol where there are mobs of people/tourists. The public spaces retain some historic flavor; some people might find that a little dated, but we liked it. (Note: if you like ultramodern decor, this is not the place for you.) We opted for a superior room and were very pleased -- it was large, with a big window facing a quiet side street, beautifully furnished/decorated (we were told it was recently renovated). It was very tasteful and definitely larger than the room we'd had a few years ago at the Westin Palace in Madrid. The bathrooms are somewhat small, since the hotel was built in the 50's, but plenty big enough and had 2 sinks with really nice toiletries, towels etc. We did not have breakfast, since we were leaving for an early flight, so I can't comment on the quality or cost. As for services -- we didn't get off to the best start only in that when we arrived, the front desk gentleman was clearly busy with some other issue or problem. It took several minutes for him to look up and greet us, let alone begin the check-in process and when he did, he was still attending to another matter so we did not have his full attention. Not a great start, but I have to believe that is not the norm. We did have to go along with someone taking us to our room, but he was friendly, told us about the hotel and didn't linger. Our suitcases arrived promptly. We immediately went out for a few hours and on our return, found 2 boxes of Leonidas chocolates and 2 upscale bottled waters waiting on a silver tray. Nice touch. And soon after, when we discovered that the air conditioning wasn't working very well, we had an excellent experience with service. My husband called the front desk, the person was efficient and kind about the problem, and a maintenance person arrived very quickly. He fixed the issue very quickly, was very friendly and attentive, and took the time to make sure it was truly solved, so there would not be a second call. Yes, that's how a 5 star property should handle things, but it doesn't always happen. I don't often stay in 5 star hotels, so it's hard for me to compare the Wellingon with its competition. We know we liked it better than the Palace -- less stuffy, more intimate, better neighborhood. Compared to London, Paris or Rome, I think hotel prices in Madrid are much more reasonable anyway, so I think the Wellington is great value for money.

Rooms are spacious, clean and with a classic decor, even if I found ours was starting to need a bit of an update, esp. as regards the bathroom (details that, albeit small, should be dealt with on account of the high price you're paying). The only downside is that the hotel does not bother to hide its right-leaning stand: only right-wing newspapers are available (\"El Pa\u00eds\" was nowhere to be seen) and the atmosphere is definitely conservative.

We were paying 140 Euro per night including breakfast for single occupancy, which was excellent value. With that in mind I should say that it is nothing short of excellent.

Given the street noise, that was a problem. It was also impossible to control the heat; it was very warm. Opening the window let in even more noise from the street and made the heating work harder. Despite the excellent bed, my sleep was less then optimal. I was not convinced by the breakfast buffet either. I would not like to pay a lot of money for it. It wasn't bad, but the choice of really healthy food was limited. The abundance of carpets could be a problem for those having allergies. The hotel is located alright, but I think some other hotels are even more central. The close proximity of the Retiro park is an asset though, and some nice restaurants can be found two blocks down the road. A real asset in summer would be the terrace and the outdoor swimming pool. Given the weather we could not use it, but I am sure that this will be a very enjoyable place when the weather improves, worth additional money. The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff could not be faulted, and also the lunches we got were excellent.

We ended up dining at the restaurant he suggested (which ended up being a chain restaurant specializing in rice dishes), hoping it would be something special if the concierge at such a good hotel recommended it, but the food was disappointing.

It was lovely and well worth visiting. On our return we were taken to our room, we had booked an executive room and glad we had as it was a good size. The bed was really comfortable and even though our room overlooked the busy road, there was little road traffic noise. On the 15th June the pool was still not opened and it was still closed when we left on the 19th June !!!!! very disappointing as this was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel over others.

If you want to eat near the hotel try Gino's Italian resturant a 5 mins walk from the hotel down Calle Del Hermosilla this is good value for money and cheaper than most places in the area. For a cup of coffee in the morning, try Delliea Coffee shop 2 roads down, it's the best value for money.

We had room service in the hotel. It wasn't great and also very very pricey. For example I had a chicken burger and chips, which was about \u20ac16 or 18 and the chips were so soggy and awful I didn't eat them. The burger was passable. Also the water in the room service bar was very expensive. There is a lovely bar and lounge area but again the drinks are pricey.

After having stayed at the 4 star Vinci Soho a couple of months ago and hated it, decided to go with a 5 star establishment that was priced the SAME!!! Well, there\u2019s a huge difference between the Soho and the Wellington, even if there\u2019s no difference in price!! Firstly from the hotel location, again a fantastic spot to be in, most important shopping streets just a short walk away, great restaurants (try Iroco a few steps from the hotel and Thai Garden, another excellent restaurant a short walk down Calle de Villanueva) as well as the Prado and Retiro park is right there at your doorstep. In terms of the pros for this hotel: 1.Great location 2.Spacious 3.Underground parking in the hotel 4.Rooms are big by European standards, medium size by US standards. I think we had what they call an Executive room, but it was surprisingly large, with high ceilings, faced inwards, and had a small entrance area and a seating area. As for closet space, I haven\u2019t seen a hotel room in such a type of hotel before that had as many as this! No less than 3 full size double door closets, with drawers and plenty of hangers. 5.Nice size LCD TV with several English channels as well as on demand movies. 6.24hr Room service that was super efficient and VERY fast (longest wait I had was 17 minutes). 7.NO NOISE! Can\u2019t stress this one enough. The rooms are super quite. So if you want a quiet sleep, this is great (though beds as usual in Europe seem to be lacking comfort) 8.Large bathroom (though not exactly best designed for efficient use of space). Still wonderful to have a very powerful shower (no water saving flow control here), double sinks, plenty of robes, towels and a host of amenities provided daily. As for the cons; 1.Room service and mini bar prices excessive!! 2.There\u2019s a lounge area downstairs, usually typical place to have an afternoon tea. This hotel hasn\u2019t got a clue what \u2018Afternoon Tea\u2019 means. Ordered Afternoon Tea and got a piece of cake and a tea pot???? Went to the Ritz instead. 3.Despite the hotel having been refurbished, room d\u00e9cor was dated and dull. But at the end of the day, I only want to sleep in the room not live in it, so it didn\u2019t bother me much. 4.Small elevators\u2026but again, typical of European hotels. 5.INEFFECIENT elevators, you can wait for 5+ minutes to see an elevator come to your floor and then you better hope it doesn\u2019t have 4 people in it because that\u2019s the maximum it can take, or 2 people with 2 pieces of luggage. 6.The dreaded Kubi WiFi at 17 euros a day! At the end of the day, the hotel served its purpose; it gave me a place to stay, with a great location and peace and quiet at night. The hotel isn\u2019t the Ritz or the Palace, so don\u2019t compare this one to 5 star establishments like those. But at the price for this place, it\u2019s more than half the cost and even cheaper than some of the 4 star hotels in town.

This hotel reminded me a lot of the Grand Hotel de la Minerve in Rome or the Cour des Loges in Lyon where I have also had the chance to stay. This is good and bad... The good: Location is absolutely great, close to the Prado and the other museums, good restaurants, shopping and nightlife within walking distance and the MadridVision bus is indeed a nice bonus. The room was clean, with loads of closet space; the Wi-Fi worked well. The bad: As a North American, I just can't get used to the two single beds stuck together instead of one queen! Also, the room is small by our standards, though bigger than the other two I mentioned above. The bathroom was clean and the two sinks was nice, but it needs an update. All in all, if I was paying 150-200$ a night, I would have thought it was great. As it were, for 205EUROS a night, so more than 300 of my lowly Canadian dollars, I thought it was quite expensive and not a great bang for your buck. As an added frustration, the bar prices are truly out of control, at 5,90Euros for a measly Diet Coke.... All in all, expensive but at least nice. I would guess Europeans would find it more to the norm than North Americans. That being said, Madrid is a really nice city, worth seeing. We also spent two days in Santa Maria de El Paular in the north mountains, which were awesome.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cThe Wellington Hotel is very comfortable.\u201d", "Author": "Reports", "ReviewID": "UR6750798", "Content": "A girlfriend and I booked the Wellington for four nights.

The staff were most solicitous and breakfast was excellent with a wide choice of food including whole smoked salmon and a ham, and one could eat as much as one liked. There was Spanish Champagne and wine too included in the breakgast. The hotel is well placed for the Prado, the Thyssen and the centre of town, and the Reitro park is within a two minute walk, as is the underground. We also found the Wellington reasonably quiet at night. This could not be said about all the hotels in Madrid! It also felt reasonably safe to walk in the immediate area. We were also well placed for the main shopping seats in the Serrano area. The hotel is slightly old fashioned, but in the nicest possible way. This is not a hotel for jeans and trainers, or those wanting designer minimalism. Some of the furnishings are rather dated, and our shower needed to be replaced as it was static, and not what is expected in a 5* hotel, however we were very comfortable and happy with the surroundings. The foyer and lounges were comfortable and there was a pianist in the evenings.

Tempers get very frayed because the fare is not cheap. Use the Metro instead. When we were there there were two bus loads of Japanese staying. There are only two lifts holding four persons in each lift - you can wait a very long time because the lifts are not synchronised and skip your floor if the first call is from another floor. Very annoying for the less mobile. Very friendly staff and excellent, but expensive food. A small fruit juice costs over six euros. Not far away is an Irish Pub doing excellent food after20.00hrs. 12 euros gets you food and a pint of Guinness.

Somewhere close to the UK, somewhere a bit elegant and accommodation to live it up a bit. After much deliberation from reading various reviews of Madrid hotels, plumped for the Wellington and very glad we did. As has previously been stated it is located in a very upmarket area of Madrid. Ideally situated for a visit to Retiro Park - literally 2 minutes from the door. We took a walk there on Sunday afternoon and I'm guessing this is the place that families and tourists go for a relaxing time judging by the number of people there. A lovely parkland oasis in the centre of such a bustling city. Full of outdoor cafes, street entertainers, market stalls and a large boating lake. The Hotel itself is what I would describe as 'very olde worlde'. A throw back to the days when service and charm were available to those who could afford it. Nowadays of course these attributes are much easier to come by through competition from other hotels but the Wellington has lost none of what it takes to make your stay both enjoyable and comfortable. Rooms are an ideal size with large comfy beds. The bathroom is almost the same size as the room itself ! Shower/bath; super power in the shower; dual wash basins; large mirror; double unit toilet; and the largest array of complmentary toiletries I have seen. We had breakfast included and took advantage of the service on both mornings. Great spread of food from just basic toast, marmalade & coffee, if it suits, down to the 'full experience' with a Full Scottish; smoked salmon and ham; AND the nice touch we had on the morning of our anniversary - the Head waiter opened the bottle of cava that sat on ice for us to set the day of as we wanted it to continue, proving it wasn't merely there for display purposes. Yes - the in-hotel menu for drinks and snacks is a bit expensive but it is served with discretion and sitting in the opulent seating area with it's chandelier surroundings - what the heck !! Another plus point for us, as it turned out, was the vicinity of the MadridVision Tour Bus Stop. I had calculated we may have a few minutes walk to the nearest one. Not at all !! Stop number 14 on the Red Route is literally on the Hotel doorstep - a bonus - as it was our intended way round the city for the couple of days we were there. It runs until midnight so you know you can get back to base having paid up front. That said we did make one taxi journey which was swift and reasonably priced. BTW - taxi fare from airport to Hotel - 25 - 30 Euros. All in all a lovely place to stay for a short break.
