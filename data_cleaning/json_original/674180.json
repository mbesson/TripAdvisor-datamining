{"Reviews": [{"Content": "perfect We booked the villa through weddingku.com for the 3D2N package for our honeymoon, were picked up right on time at the airport with their shuttlebus that had a cooler box containing cool towels and refreshments. What surprised us was that the photos on the internet made the villa look larger that it really is, but we prefer the actual size (more cozy for us honeymooners). we were lucky to get villa #1 which is the closest to the reception and has its own jacuzzi next to the private pool. The villa is very well equipped, the honeymoon cake delicious, the sofa set comfortable, the bathtub big enough for two.- Use the bicycles for free to explore the surrounding area, we cycled to the beach next to Petitenget Temple, the roads are not busy but the location is close enough to oberoi 'eat street.' or you can rent an automatic scooter for 50 k/day - It was very hot outside in the afternoon, so we suggest you get your massage at that time or swim in the shady private pool at that time and venture out before 10 am or after 3 pm.- The villa would be perfect for a gathering with your few closest friends, you can buy food supplies nearby, cook dinner, entertain them by the living room, pool and even the rooftop sundeck at night. - The staff are unintrusive, polite and helpful. Some butlers may not appear as enthusiastic as the others but they did their job well and we think it is merely a matter of disposition.Overall, we enjoyed our stay and highly recommend it for couples and friends traveling together.", "Date": "Oct 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR798490798", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "chatoyant"}, {"Content": "For the price, I am not impressed       Bathtub", "Date": "Aug 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR997823160", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Ganee"}, {"Content": "Absolutely great Villas Me and my wife had excellent 6 nights stay in Island Villas. The location is not on the beach, but you can use Resort Seminyak services for free if you like which is a beach front resort (good surfing in front). Resort is a bit tired though. Island Villas are within walkable distance from many great restaurants in Seminyak and your butler will drive you any restaurant in Seminyak, Kuta, Legian for free if you dont want to walk. Butler will come to pick you up as well for free. Even in the middle of night. Excellent service! All the Villas are same standard and size. They are very comfortable and stylish. Great kitchen/living room combination with flat tv and audio system. Separate bed room and big bathroom with big tub for 2 people. Each villa has own private garden with a 10m x 2m swimming pool and a sun deck with outdoor shower. You can access to your swimming pool from the bedroom and living room. You have also nice private pavillion and sun loungers on your rooftop. Island Villas has great staff. Very friendly and they are willing to help you in any case. Villas has also nice in-room dining menu so you can order great meals to your villa with very reasonable price. Breakfast is also served every morning in to your own unit. This place is very comfortable and I can only recommend it.", "Date": "Jul 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR230132681", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Blumma"}, {"Content": "The Great Escape       delicious american breakfast served in our villa", "Date": "May 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR560382918", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Flyuphigh"}, {"Content": "Love the hotel Very nice escape while in Bali was this Bali Island Villas  Spa, my wife and I had a enjoyable time for few days.

Every villa has its own spacious sundeck, and an upper-floor open space where you could have your in-room massage on super-king size lounge bed under the sala. The interior decoration is modern chic, designed by the same team behind Ku De Ta. Each villa is equipped with modern kitchen and a good size living room and separate bedroom.The hotel service is superb. On our second visit 6 months later, the hotel manager welcomed us by our first names, and remembered exactly each of our food preference. Your stay comes with your private car to use around Seminyak and Kuta areas at anytime you wish. We took several 10min trips out to the supermarket to replenish our champagne and wine appetite during our stay.Suggest to dine one night in the villa, it may sound boring, but I guarantee you not. Dine under the stars, surrounded by 100 candles and rose petals covered pool, I say no more. We celebrated my partner's birthday during our stay, and the hotel staff presented a surprise birthday cake during our delightful candlelight dinner. We've tried other properties with pool villas every time we visited Bali, and each time we stayed only 1 night in the new property and checked back into Bali Island Villas for the rest of our stay in Bali. The hotel service, the privacy and the comfort we received at Bali Island Villas set a difficult benchmark for other properties to match.", "Date": "Oct 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR605603506", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "capybaradays"}, {"Content": "\u9477\ue044\u578e\u9287\ue1bc\ue18d\u9287\ue0a2\u7733\u9288\u5b28\u501b\u9287\u55d0\u4efe\u705e\u546d\u7e3e\u9366\u822c\u4f04\u9479\ue218\u4e9c\u9289\u6dec\u5045\u9289\u253f\u4ef9\u9287\u6b0d\u20ac?#x201d;   showReview(21744992, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR533194200", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "\u9289\u5fcb\u5118\u9289\u72ae\u5157\u9289\u70bd\u4f00\u93c8\u20ac\u95ac\u253e\u6ad4   showReview(19914585, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR715975604", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469404-d674180-r21015839-Bali_Island_Villas_Spa-Seminyak_Bali.html", "HotelID": "674180", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
