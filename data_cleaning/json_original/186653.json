Upon check-in we naturally asked for something with a view, the response was it's hard to get a view these days in downtown Montreal - fair enough. We were given a room on the 7th floor - not too bad but not that great either: smaller room at the end of the hallway so the shape was a bit cut out, it had a window that covered 2 mini walls basically - this would be ok but as it was a very cold weekend the room was pretty chilly and turning up the heat did not do much. Little outdated TV was on the side of the bed but could not be totally turned to face the bed due to the wall blocking it. The view was of a large office building across the street. We knew there was construction happening and assumed it was all throughout the hotel because we could actually see and hear people working on the 2 rooms across ours. No biggie. However at about 6am we were awoken by some serious banging what seemed like a room above ours. We could not believe our ears or fall back to sleep so naturally I called the reception desk asking if there is construction everywhere and if we can be relocated: she responded saying \"oh no construction is only on 7th and 8th floor!\" Why on earth would someone give us a room in the middle of construction zone was beyond me! The lady was very nice and of course offered us immediate re-location which we accepted as we were staying 1 more night. The next room we were given: 21st floor! AMAZING view of the bridge, sky, Molson building in the distance, big screen TV, Internet etc... Totally made up for it! Overall staff service was very good, location is great, the only minus was the renovations and the first fellow who checked us in giving us a room in the middle of construction zone with no view when clearly better options existed.

The location is terrific, it was clean and convenient, and all of the staff were very nice. On arrival I asked to see a couple of rooms and the receptionist advised me very well. Everyone was very child-friendly -- the receptionist gave our 6-year-old a little gift bag when we arrived, the housekeeper arranged her stuffed animals very cutely, and she was welcome to accompany me to the pool. We had a spacious room with a balcony and a nice little sitting area, which made it comfortable to have a couple of small meals in the room. The beds were OK, not as firm as we like but with nice medium-weight duvets and tons of pillows. The bathroom furnishing was not the most modern, but we don't expect everything to have been built or updated in the past 20 years, and the towels and toiletries were lovely. The carpet was not new and there were some old stains in the entryway, but it seemed clean. Internet access in the room is 16 Canadian per day and you are tethered to the wall (ethernet, not wireless), but we paid for it anyway. There is free wireless in the lobby but that isn't so convenient for families with young kids. There is an IGA 4 blocks away, handy and valuable given the prices even in convenience stores are. It took some time to find a parking spot in the garage on our Saturday night arrival due to a wedding being held in the hotel, but the rest of the time there were plenty of spaces. The price for parking seemed steep -- 26 Canadian per night -- but I'm not sure what the alternatives are. It was definitely nice to have the in/out option in addition to the Metro just a block away. The food in the hotel restaurant was good and the service was very friendly. The lap pool in the hotel is a great bonus for swimmers. I think the web site claimed three lanes and it was set up for two, but that was no problem when we were there on the weekend. It was a nice temperature and the changing room and fitness center were great. Apparently the hot tub was overheated, though -- we didn't try it but another guest had to call the fitness center assistant in to fix it, which must have taken some time. All in all a really nice experience.

A Metro stop is about a block away. Our room was huge with a large sitting area with two comfy armchairs with a small table in between. A good reading lamp sat directly behind the small table. The beds were so comfortable I slept like a baby. There was a balcony where you could go outside and watch the people below. There were also two other big windows giving the room a very airy feel to it. I saw photos posted by a traveler to the Delta Montreal in June 2011 that showed peeling wallpaper in the bathroom and it looked terrible. The first thing I did was checked out the bathroom -- large, clean, no peeling wallpaper (great shower). If you're into working out and swimming on your out of town stays, wait until you see the workout room and the pool. I have never seen one like it in a hotel. The pool is Olympic size and has warm salt water. It was great after sightseeing all day. I also have to mention the staff -- they were so helpful and soooooo nice. We were able to find some great places to eat based on their recommendations. I know I'm going on and on, but it was truly a great experience. And I was able to book a rate of $109 CAD per night.

The room was as described in many other reviews - carpeting was buckled in on place( I tripped over it several times) and looked dirty, one curtain was not hung properly, bathroom door had a hole on the inside, shower head only worked on one setting, sink drain stop didn't stay (was fixed after complaint),towel rack was loose (also fixed), furniture was dated and looked very worn and scratched, one lamp socket was hanging loose, phone was an old unit with no instructions, tv was an old model. There were holes in the balcony floor. I had also called a few days before we arrived to request a refrigerator, but it was not there when we arrived. My wife was shocked that I didn't demand a room change, but the room location and comfort of the bed were very important because of many poor previous experiences with noise. I discussed many of these issues with the general manager, a very nice young man, who explained that he was well aware of them, and received many calls from people who had read these reviews.

First off, the carpets in both of my rooms (906-908) were disgusting and dirty, they had noticeable stains all over the them. I did not take off my shoes while in the rooms they were that disgusting and dirty. Also the shower heads had barley any water pressure and water came out almost like a dripping tap. The service at the Hotel was terrible, the front desk was rude and snobby when asking about anything. They lied to me about the cost of parking overnight by only telling me parking was $26. They did say that I could go in and out but forgot to tell me it was $26 per night and that parking in the city is free during weekends. So I was quite surprised when my parking bill was $63 and not the $30 I thought it would be. The hotel concierges knew absolutely nothing about the city when asked and they too were rude and snobby. I asked for directions numerous times and was either told the wrong way every time or told \"oh it's about 20 minutes that way\" with them pointing to a random direction. The map of city they had at they're desk did not even a compass on it and I'm not even sure why I kept asking for directions after the first 3 times they got us lost (it was mostly to see if they would ever send us in the right direction). They never once offered to print out directions, write them down or even lead us to a good place to eat only saying \"St. Catherine's street has food\". It seemed every time I asked about anything they told me to goto St. Catherine's Street which was about 2 blocks from the hotel. They never once said to check out Old Montreal or Mount Royal or actually anything when asked where there are good places to see and eat. I asked them to make restaurant reservations for 9 on Saturday and that too I had to end up doing myself after asking 3 times, without once being offered to take my name down so that they could try to do it when they get a chance. I seriously think they should all be re-trained because they have one of the most important jobs in the hotel and they knew nothing but to be snobby, unhelpful and annoying. I know I learned more about the city in 3 days then they probably know after spending they're whole life there. Overall it was a very bad experience since we did spend most of the time getting lost and looking ourselves for places to eat and site see. For spending $560 on two rooms for 2 nights and staying at the well known hotel chain, I will probably never stay at a Delta again, especially that one.

The rooms were spacious, we had two rooms with king beds and a third room which had two double beds. This last room had a balcony of its own even. It is one of the better delta's i've stayed at. Comparable to a sheraton. The hotel was quite busy and the elevators are very slow.. something I heard a lot of people complain about. Morning staff were extremely helpful and friendly. I had free internet ( had i taken a laptop) in my room. Parking at the hotel is fairly expensive given rates at the other garages and the didgy condition of the Delta garage, but we paid the $26/night for the ease. Only real issue I had was that on our 1st night, one of my friends got locked out of their rooms and concierge had to call and wake me and my husband up. Because the rooms were under my name they wouldn't let my friend back into his room,despite me okaying it over the phone and providing them with his name as verification, after all the concierge did call my room directly. I had to go downstairs with a piece of ID and when I did, the guy didn't even look at my ID but stated that it was ok ( I suppose in his defense I did have a pretty mean look on my face and was not pleased about being woken up at 3 a.m. ..) On check out it came out that we didn't have hot water in the morning and the staff very kindly volunteered on their own accord to discount 40% off that night's rate, which was very nice of them as we weren't expecting that, especially because we had already paid for all three rooms.

I filled out all the information including that we are a family of 4 including 2 children. Having said that, when we arrived, which was late at night, at the hotel and went into the floor (3rd) the smell of cigarettes was overwhelming so I thought maybe the room will be an exception. Well, I was wrong. The room smelled so much like cigarettes... much more than the hallway. I was not expecting this because as I mentioned the information I provided to hotwire included that we were traveling with two kids. Two seconds after we got inside the room my son (10 years old) went to the bathroom and got locked in. The door would not open. We had to call maintenance but they did come right away and fixed the problem. Needless to say we had already decided we would ask for a room change however we waited for the next morning because the kids were too tired. The next day we asked to change rooms and were asked to come back after other people had checked out, which we did and were given another room without problems. The 2nd room was smoke free so we had no problems in that department. However, the showers were a mission. The hot water was not consistent and would go back to cold and then back to hot in an instant (this was also a problem in the 1st room). I did like the beds (they both had pillowtop mattresses and very comfy pillows and he rooms were seemingly clean (I write it that way because the first room had kit kats under the bed). No fridge or microwave in either room. On the second day my kids asked if we can go to the pool so we did. The pool smelled funny, and after our time there and our swimming clothes were dried they stunk very badly. I had to put them in a separate bag so I would not mix them with the other clothes. They need to do a better job in cleaning that pool. Also, there are not lifeguards. The things that I did like about the hotel were that is very closed to everything (at walking distance), had many services available right in the lobby (entreprise rental, taxi, spa, etc), and were very cordial.

We booked it for a good price on hotwire, which I picked because they rated it a 3.5 star and it had a pool. The pool is a necessity because its always the highlight for our kids. That and watching movies before going to bed. Here's the rundown of what happened: The first night: We arrived late- about 8pm and the \"ONLY\" room left for me, my mom and my daughter in this huge hotel was a smoking room with a king size bed. We are not smokers and my daughter was gagging the whole time. So we went to the pool. The pool looked much bigger online, but at least it was indoors. After getting into it however, it seemed very dirty. Again, I can put up with a lot, but there was dirt all around the edges, the water seemed cloudy and in spots the bottom of the pool seemed slippery. And there was mildew all on the ceiling. So we went back to the room hoping to see a movie and after an hour trying to work the tv and calling down to the desk, they could not get it to work. By the way, the tv was one of those old boxy kinds and not very big. The second night: We requested to be moved, so somehow by 9am we got a non smoking room and two full sized beds that was clean and ready to be moved into. (Were they really full the night before or was it because we were discount guests they didn't want to be hospitable?) When we tried to rent a movie that night, the same thing happened. The person at the desk could not get it to work even after checking to make sure everything was activated. The janitor was even sent up to the room to check it. It was kind of insulting- we are seasoned travelers who know how to rent movies! It never worked, so the front desk person said when we leave the room in the morning to tell the front desk and they will get a repair person to go up and fix it while we are out. Third day: So in the morning we did that. Finally we got a competent person who looked in back and found that the switch had never been activated! That evening we finally got to watch our movie on the old tv. Another aspect about this room: the sheets on the mattress are not fitted (which I don't think is unusual for beds in hotels) however, the sheet wasn't even pulled down over the mattress- it was like a previous review said- like the bed was short sheeted! So we remade the bed, not well enough I guess though, because in the morning the sheet had slipped off and we were sleeping on the bare mattress! Gross! The last morning: I went to see what kind of compensation we could get for the mattress experience, the smoky room and the tv problems and they kindly waived all my parking fees for 3 days. And of course we weren't charged for the movie. It was fine. I don't like complaining, but this was a crazy bad experience. Also, the concierge was only adequate. Not friendly at all, but gave the basic information we asked for. The hotel from the lobby looks like a 3.5 or 4 star, but the hallways and rooms look like a 2 star. Worse than any cheap hotel we've stayed at. The rooms were dated- formica counters in the bathrooms. One bathroom light over the sink- making a very dark toilet and shower area. No fridge in the room. Badly stained carpets and a thick layer of dust around the corners of the room where the carpet meets the walls. Now that my kids are getting to be teens, our values have switched in hotels to needing decent pools and movie service. We won't be staying here anymore. But I imagine someone looking for a deal could make this hotel work if they tuck in their sheets real well and overlook the mold and dust. The only good things were the location- right downtown- and the bar. We had dinner in the bar that first night and it was amazing. The food was delicious and beautifully presented. Better than most restaurants we went to those 3 days.", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cModern, clean, great location, quality weight room\u201d", "Author": "saltsunandtime", "ReviewID": "UR43102026", "Content": "Travel zoo $99/night.

We were excited to get a good deal and to stay in a beautiful place. Service was good overall. Staff were helpful and resourceful. Room was very disappointing though. It was a small corner room (our booking said it was to be an oversized hotel room!). As well, it was very dirty, stained and torn up. Rugs were heavily stained throughout the room, closet doors and walls were dirty and evidently not routinely cleaned (water stains, dirt smears, etc.) and the carpet was ripped, torn and loose entering the bathroom area.

We ended up talking to the Manager about our experience and disappoinment where he was shocked to hear that the hotel was rated as a 5 star. He said that it was only a 3 star!

The hotel is clean, well staffed and equipped. Overall, a good value for the money (depending on your rate). HOTEL OVERVIEW: The facilities are good. Arrival was painless. First impression of the hotel was clean and well maintained with an attractive lobby area that was well marked with signs and easily managed with luggage. Parking was easy (we self-parked) and came right up the elevator into the hotel lobby from the inside. Front Desk staff were pleasant and friendly and assisted with everything we needed upon arrival. We took up our own bags so bell-service was not used (nor offered oddly enough). ROOM: I was on the 19th Floor in a superior room, smoking with two full-sized bed (room 1919). The room was a good size for two people but I could not imagine a family of four being comfortable. The little balcony was great but it needed a could of chairs and a small table so your could enjoy it. I would have loved to sit out there and have breakfast and a coffee but there is not furniture out there. There was only one chair in the room due to the space limitations obviously. I think King rooms have two chairs. The photos are size-misleading so that was a surprise. The overall impression was that the room was dated (except for the beds). The green carpeting, old style TV and mis-matched, falling apart lamps that were chipped and wobbly gave the impression of a motel decor rather than a full-service hotel. The furniture, decor and fixtures could use a soft-goods upgrade. The bed was extremely comfortable so that was a nice surprise. The bathroom was dated as well with formica counters, 70's sink, bad lighting and tub/shower combination. Maybe I've gotten spoiled but it also gave the impression of a motel bathroom (utilitarian and clean but not much else). FACILITIES: We went swimming and used the hot tub in the pool area. It was clean, well maintained and pleasant to use. I didn't use the gym part so I can't comment on that. We stopped by the spa and looked around. It was well staffed but a bit overpriced ($30 CD for a manicure) but if you need a service, they have it available. STAFF: We used the Concierge a few times but often his suggestions failed to impress. The first night we asked for something close and he sent us to an Italian restaurant around the corner. While close, the food was not very good but okay. He was unfamiliar with a few restaurants I asked about (Les Halles is one example). He also stated that the buffet at the casino was open 24/7 however that also was not the case as they stop serving at 10:30PM. One would expect he would know that, as well as other details about major tourist attractions. He had to look online for restaurants, ect. which lead me to believe he lacked personal knowledge of a good concierge and instead relied on the internet or a program to guide his suggestions. The housekeeping staff and reception staff were all friendly and helpful. I was pleased on both ends with their service and friendly hello. Overall, I would return to the Delta Montreal but only if the rate was good (we paid $166 per night AAA rate). They didn't WOW me in any particular way but they didn't turn me off either. I would only suggest they upgrade/update the rooms to match the public areas of the hotel, train their concierges and allow more personal experience with tourist areas and restaurants so their advice is from personal experience and not a computer program used to guide them.", "Date": "July 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam, NY", "Title": "\u201cLove the information\u201d", "Author": "nan315", "ReviewID": "UR18038514", "Content": "Very friendly atmosphere.

Local, and 800 calls are free if you sign up for a Delta priviledge card. Ther is a reasonable price Spa, and a good sized fitness center. I did not notice the pool, neither of us was interested in swimming over sightseeing. There was a boxing convection on the 2nd floor conference areas. However, no fights were reported.

The Delta is very close to the main shopping district so if that's something you're into then the Delta would be a good choice.", "Date": "May 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando, Florida", "Title": "\u201cVery Pleased with the Delta Montreal\u201d", "Author": "marc1976", "ReviewID": "UR16450524", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Delta Montreal from May 24, 2008 to May 27, 2008 in room 1110. Overall we were very pleased with our stay and would definitely stay here again. About a week before we arrived I mailed the hotel a letter requesting a non-smoking room on a high floor that was recently renovated. When we arrived we got exactly what we requested (the 11th floor was the highest floor for the type of room we stayed in). Check-in only took a minute and there was almost no wait to check in at about 2:30 pm. The hotel was in a great location, halfway between Mont Royal Park and Old Montreal and amidst all the large skyscrapers. The walk to Old Montreal was only about 10 minutes. The Place Des Arts subway station was a 1 minute walk down the street, which we took to Casino de Montreal and where I won $103 playing blackjack (yeah for me!). The room was very large and spacious. I could tell it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t renovated yesterday, but still looked very clean. The beds were very comfortable and had a large assortment of pillows. Our room had its own balcony. The television had about 35 channels to choose from, which came in crystal clear. Half the channels were in French, but they still had CNN, TLC, NBC, CBS, ABC, ESPN, Discovery, a local Vermont affiliate, and some other channels. The room also came with a work desk and some sofa chairs. The noise from the AC was very minimal and I was not able to hear any of the guests in the adjacent rooms. The room also had cordless phones. The bathroom was nice, but not spectacular. The sink had a lot of counter space and our complimentary shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion were replaced every day. The shower worked fine, but the tub seemed a bit small. We had at least three large towels every day and about 4-5 smaller towels. The bathroom also had an extending vanity mirror. We used the indoor pool and hot tub area every day. We did not go into the pool and preferred the hot tub instead. The pool water was a little too cold for my liking, but I saw plenty of adults and kids swim in the pool so it must not have been too bad. I appreciated the fact that the pool area was open until 9:00 pm every night. There was also a fitness center and squash court that we did not use. There were also two computers available that had free internet access. There was a free newspaper every morning delivered to our door and maid service was excellent. The staff was friendly and helpful. We called for a Chinese food restaurant recommendation and they called us back within a few minutes. Everyone was polite and spoke English. There is a supermarket on Rue Bleury due east on the tourist map (north in reality) and a nice little bakery called La Patisserie Belge just one block past that where we purchased croissants and bread every morning. Across the street is a Second Cup Caf\u00c3\u00a9 (the Canadian Starbucks) that had a nice outside seating area. Be forewarned, there is graffiti in the area adjacent to the hotel. Graffiti, however, seems to be rampant all over Montreal, even on nice buildings in nice areas. Therefore, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re in a bad/unsafe part of Montreal just because you see a lot of graffiti. We felt completely safe walking all around Montreal, day or night. There were some minor issues with our stay. The room did not have a refrigerator and we were not able to get a queen-sized bed, but two full beds instead. The pool water could have been warmer, the windows on the balcony were not clean, and they could have had a much better selection of tourist-related information pamphlets. Only the even-numbered floors had ice machines. The odd-numbered floors had Coke vending machines. The carpets in the hallways need to be replaced badly. The restaurants in Old Montreal were a bit pricey. We recommend Peel Pub on Peel Street. The food there was very good, very affordable, and came with huge portions. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on a budget, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great way to save money, get a great meal, and have leftovers to bring back to the room. I do not know the exact price of the room per night as I purchased a vacation package on Expedia for 4 days/3 nights, roundtrip airfare for two from NYC, fees, and taxes for $958.00. I guess we paid less than $90.00 per night. This was not the Ritz or Four Seasons, but it was a great value for a very good hotel. We would definitely stay here again. Marc T.

This hotel is a 2.5 at best. The room we were given was in need of renovation. The carpet was worn, the bathroom sink dripped, the heat in the room didn't work correctly. The bed wasn't comfortable and only had 2 pillows. Most 3.5 hotels have at least 4 pillows without asking for them. The food was overpriced and we ended up walking downtown for our meals. Being close and within walking distance to the downtown stores/restaurants was a huge plus. If you wanted to have internet access in your room it was $13/day which I feel was on the high end for this service. However, if you timed it right, you could use one of the two computers they had in the business center for free. When we checked out we were asked how our stay was and when I said okay I was asked why just ok. So I ended up saying we booked this hotel based on the 3.5 rating and she said we could have been upgraded to a better room (Delta room) for $20+ per night. In my opinion, if you book a 3.5 hotel the room should be a 3.5 and not have to pay additional money to get the 3.5 room. I guess this is where I probably won't book through Hotwire.

The Pros: Location is great, close to all the excitement downtown.

For $73/night, the room we had was great, on a non-smoking floor as requested. Nice pool and hot tub in the hotel, and free copy of the Saturday Globe and Mail was delivered to our hotel room. The Cons: Internet access in the hotel room is not free, which was disappointing. Parking at the hotel is $22.50/night, which we avoided by using 24 parking at the nearby National Archive library. However, because we couldn't pay for an entire weekend of parking at once, we got nailed with a $25 parking ticket because we were delayed in returning to the parking garage to pay for the 2nd 24-hour time period. Still cheaper than using the hotel's parking though. We also got billed $1.50 for a single local telephone call in the hotel room. Nothing comes free these days I guess ;) The only other issue we had was that our taxi driver from the hotel to take us to the biodome was very rude, but I'm not sure how closely affiliated with the hotel he was.

It reminded me of a resort breakfast with plenty of fresh fruit, cheeses, hot waffles with maple syrup, eggs, meats, cold and hot cereals, fresh juices, teas and coffees. The second night I was on the 21st floor. The 21 to the 23rd floors can only be accessed by room card in the elevator.

There is a table on the balcony for you to use when the weather is pleasant. This breakfast is mostly business people reading their paper or quietly texting. The second room had a larger washroom with extra items like body wash. The main room had a sitting area with two chairs, a small table and desk. The office table was large with a comfy office chair, lamp and a bamboo plant. It was a lovely room. I received a Globe and Mail in the morning.

It is not quite the Parisian outpost you might have heard it is but it does have a French flavor. You can watch the Simpsons in French and then watch the Simpsons in English an hour or two later!

The rooms are quite spacious, which is a nice change from hotels that cram every open area with either more furniture or a wall (so they can put in another room). The staff were very friendly and did what pretty much every other human being does: if you're friendly to them, they'll be friendly to you. I'm betting that a lot of the people posting reviews who had evil staff experiences engineered a lot of the tension, directly or indirectly. The location was great -- very close to either McGill or Place Des Arts Metro stations. Unlike Toronto, the Montreal metro is extremely convenient and very well planned (i.e. you can actually use it to...go places that you want to go). There are only 2 real problems with this place: 1. The self-described \"Business Centre\" isn't. It's a couple of (very, very dirty) desktop computers in a room that is actually smaller than the hotel room. It's not a centre at all -- it's more of an \"internet kiosk\", like the kind you'd find at the library. This is (probably) okay if you're just checking your email, but if you actually want to conduct business then don't be fooled by the title of this little room. You will be unable to conduct any real business here, so don't count on it. 2. The idea that you have to pay for in-room Internet is as TACKY as it gets. I have actually been in hotels in the 3rd world -- places where most people couldn't afford a laptop if they saved for years -- that offered free wifi. Why? Because it's just a basic staple. It's not a luxury anymore -- it's as basic as a telephone or TV cable. This hotel, however, weasels around this and charges something like $15 a day for Internet access. Why? Not because they have to offset the cost -- their Internet cost is fixed, like their TV cable. They're charging it because, evidently, it's a cash cow and people are willing to pay. This is just tacky. Overall, $15 a day is very little, but the idea of it lingers -- it's just bad PR and Delta Montreal should be ashamed of this.

The fitness center and aquatics facility do leave something to be desired. The hot tub jets did not function, even after visits by the maintenance staff. The salt water pool was nice, but is more suited to lap swimming than family vacations. There were times that the pool could not be used by hotel guests, as aquatics classes were taking place.

It was slightly larger and had free internet (which we didn't use).......but the bathroom was a trainwreck. A drippy faucet, the shower had a very slow drain and the toilet would hardly flush. Ugh. Not wanting to change rooms one more time, we stuck it out but my the time we left, we literally had to remove the top off of the back of the toilet and fix the plunger chain ourselves to flush it! I emailed the hotel with my complaints but have had no reply whatsoever from their management. It ended being a lot more expensive than we'd hoped. Adding the charge for our \"superior\" room and two nights of parking (self-park, not valet) our bill with the 17 lines of different taxes came to more than $90 (in addition to the amount we paid in advance on Priceline).

I wanted to book a group spa day in Montreal, but my group was only available on Canada Day...most spas in the city were closed for the holiday. Also, the Jazz Festival was being held in Montreal the same weekend so lots of tourists were in town booking restaurants & spas. Appointment: There is no spa menu on the Delta Montreal website- the only reason I knew the spa was there was from a past stay. I called the spa and asked them info about the spa and to send me a brochure & price list...person who answered the phone was very informative and friendly. However, they would not block the afternoon until I received all the requests from my group, though they took my name and phone # for reference when I called back. I gathered my group's appointment requests, and called the spa directly to schedule the appointments- no problems there. Staff: Receptionist is friendly, but often overwhelmed as guests come into the spa asking questions and spa go-ers rush to and from their treatments through the reception area. Estheticians were very accommodating as well, no snobbery here. Spa layout: Small spa lounge is located toward the back of the spa, so each time a treatment is complete, you would have to walk past all the treatment rooms to get there. I had no problem during my hot stone massage, but others commented that the doors were not soundproof and talking from guests & staff are heard throughout what is supposed to be a relaxing treatment, even when not very loud. Our group pretty much took over the spa, so if I were another spa guest, I would have been annoyed. Nail salon area is across the hall and pool is down the hall, all in a open area that hotel guests can wander through. If you are somewhat self-conscious in a robe moving between the areas, that would be a problem. Reception area is busy & small, with guests & staff moving through, and not enough chairs. We were also given access to the pool & fitness center down the hall...the pool & jacuzzi was indoor and ok...just not too well decorated. Locker rooms were kind of old looking, and definitely not very spa-like. Spa treatments: I had a wonderful hot stone massage, great esthetician. One person in my group commented on how cold the treatment room was, but I didn't notice b/c of the heat from the stones. I also had a pedicure- I was stuck in a corner of a small room across the hall. The pedicurist was very nice...but she did not have all her tools in one place and was constantly getting up to find them. The pedicure itself was fair, but no spa chair...I was sitting on a regular chair while my pedicurist was on the floor. Not sure if she was new or less trained, the pedicure did not last long after the day. Value: Spa treatments are very inexpensive compared to the US. My hot stone massage would have cost twice as much in the States. Nail & other salon treatments are about the same price as other spas, but I would say overpriced for what I received. I would have just gotten the massage had I toured the spa area prior to booking but I was booking from out-of-town. Some of the group wanted more spa treatments than others so timing was a little off- some of us had more \"downtime\" than we had intended. Free snacks in the lounge & access to pool was a nice add to the treatments (I've been to other hotels that charge for these). Pros: Friendly staff, snacks available, nice massage rooms, access to pool & locker room Cons: Small spa lounge, so-so nail salon Overall, to me a bargain but don't expect a 5-star spa.", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201cHummer Stolen in Lot Be Careful\u201d", "Author": "rcp126", "ReviewID": "UR5530554", "Content": "We arrived at the Delta on Thursday and the first thing we noticed was the faint smell of smoke in the hallways.

Perhaps I am too picky and maybe a bit anal, but the pictures advertised and displayed on the internet are not an accurate reflection of the hotel and the rooms. We arrived at the hotel at noon on our day of check-in. The hotel is in a good location more in the business district, but relatively close to everything. The lobby was nice and appealing. The front desk staff was extremely friendly and allowed us an early check-in. Our room, located on the 12th floor was not a 3 star, and by far not a 4 star as some places advertise it as. The entire floor smelled like cigarette smoke as did our room. Both were in poor condition. The carpets were filty and all the furnishing were VERY dated. Basic bathoom. The window were so dirty you could barely see out of them. And the balcony is hardly such as one chair could not fit there; it is a concete enclosure and not at all appealing. We brought our 7 month old with us and fed her on the bed accidently spilling her entire bowl on cereal on the sheets. The next day at bedtime we noticed that the sheets had not been changed. I requested some be brought up to us and moments later they arrived damp with stray hairs on them. The pool, hottub, and gym very satisfactory. Nice, but nothing special. I would not stay here again as the hotel does not compare to other Delta's I have had the pleasure of enjoying. The only positive thing I can say about this hotel and Montreal is the staff.

Only one clerk and a long line. We had reserved a non-smoking king size room over the phone.

We were told that there are king sized rooms on the upper floors that we could have for an additional $40 per night. What a joke!

We walked onto the balcony only to discover cigar butts all over. After calling downstairs I was informed that they do not clean the balconies after each guest checks out. They did send someone up fairly quickly to sweep them up. The beds were extremely small and uncomfortable. No good view. Furniture rather shabby and the tub would not turn completely off.
