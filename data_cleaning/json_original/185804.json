When a fire forced us out of our home, I called the Granville Island Hotel and asked their rate for one night. It was evening and the fellow at the desk said he \"could do $149\". We took the room, and the next morning I called down to the desk and asked if we could stay in this room another night at the same rate. The answer was yes. When we checked out we signed the credit card bill and were off. However, when we got home,I looked at the bill and realized we were overcharged. $169 and $179. I called to straighten this out and spoke to Kim, the manager on duty. We went back and forth for a while, but I gave in when she told me \"Impossible. We have no rate ever of $149\". I swallowed the new rate and felt she thought I was trying to pull a fast one. I was so upset with the fire, maybe I had made the mistake. We could still not return to our home and since the location was best for us, we called to book in for a few more nights. The woman at the desk easily offered a room for $149 the first night, and a bit higher subsequent nights. I took this but had her email the confirmation this time. My mind was on dealing with the restoration of our home , not the rate of this hotel, so I let this go at the time. When I received an email asking me to write a review for Trip Advisor, I phoned the gal and told her why I was unhappy before i wrote this. Christine sympathized but did not adjust the rate. She said she would send us a free dinner coupon to make up for our troubles. I declined, saying that was not the reason I had phoned. She insisted she attempt to make it up to us. Never received the dinner coupon! Had this not happened, my review would say nice hotel, but beware there are huge differences in the rooms here. There are some that look down on huge vats, which I gather produce beer, and the hum of these kept me up all one night. One night our room was spacious, another room was quite cramped.

It's a calm, well-designed \"boutique\" hotel tucked just past the end of the road on Granville Island. Check-in was friendly and efficient, and our room, although small, was fine. Even though we had requested the basic \"non-view\" category, our little balcony had a view of the water across to downtown, and a bonus was the fireworks over Science World (after all, it was Halloween). My only quibbles are small. The public spaces are nicely decorated, but our room had a couple of sad \"department store\" prints on the walls - and considering Granville Island is a hub of artistic activity, I would have loved to see better art (why not link with the Emily Carr school of art across the street, and promote local artists?). A tiny problem, but big when you are in a hurry: offer better hair dryers than the low-powered one provided. And the most annoying: the room lighting is poor, in particular the reading light. There actually isn't any; the bedside lamp is too dim to read by. My husband tried removing the shade from the lamp, which only helped a tiny bit. On November mornings, it's great to get the newspaper delivered to the door, but until the sun came up we had trouble reading it.

We had been on Granville Island before and wanted something close to the action there. We were very pleased with the hotel. We arrived fairly early in the day (mid-morning) and were able to check in right away. Our room was reasonably spacious, clean and well-maintained. When we had a minor problem, maintenance came immediately to look at it and fixed the issue right away. We found our room quiet and never had any noise issues. Front desk staff were very helpful in giving us hints on local activities and with check in and out, as well as bike rental. The location is close to the Granville Island market, a comedy club, theatre, the galleries and studios of the island and a small ferry ride from the recreational pathway that goes to Stanley Park and the seawall. It is located in a quiet corner of the island next to a waterside park. One night that we were there a fireworks competition was held in the English Bay area. With good directions from the front desk, we found an excellent place to watch the show for free from across the bay and were able to easily walk there and back. The hotel rents bikes (including helmets) right outside their door and by means of the small ferry (which also takes bikes) you can easily connect with your bike to the main pathways leading all the way to Stanley Park. We also made use of the bus which we caught just off the island and were able to reach the beaches area in about 20 min. There is a restaurant associated with the hotel. Our first experience at lunchtime on what was a beautiful, busy sunny holiday weekend was a bit disappointing in that the service was very slow and not super attentive. However, when we later ate breakfast there twice the waiter was exceptional - he even remembered our likes and dislikes from one day to the next. The quality of the food was good, although it was fairly expensive, as you might expect in a big city hotel restaurant. There are several other very inexpensive, informal eating choices nearby for breakfast or lunch in the Granville Is. market building. There are fewer dinner choices on island after the stores shut down, although there are some.

If you are a jogger simply head to the seawall and head in either direction... personally I prefer heading west towards the beach.

We ate at the restaurant for breakfast once and had room service as well. Both were good. After living in Vancouver for several years, then coming back to visit, we found this hotel gave us an entirely different perspective of the city - one that we fully appreciated! Our only slightly negative comment was that the large kitchen area had plenty of wine glasses, but nothing else - no cutlery, no plates, etc. so that when we bought food to bring back to the room, we had nothing to eat it with. However, a quick call down to the front desk had all that delivered within minutes. We mentioned this upon check-out and they seemed happy to add those items to the room in future. I would definitely come back to this hotel and bring my kids next time!", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charlotte, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Location, needs more updating\u201d", "Author": "sungirl18", "ReviewID": "UR117592550", "Content": "My husband stayed at the Granville Island hotel in May of this year for the second time. The location is perfect. With the convenience of the water taxis you can leave your car behind and explore the city. I love the character of Granville island. It is a wonderful eclectic community in Vancouver with great restaurants and wonderful views. The hotel is lovely, however they truly need a major room makeover. We stayed there March 2009 and it needed updating then as the furniture was pretty banged up. They made a several changes I imagine due to the Olympics last year but from what I could tell from the room we were in this time they only got part way through the redecorating. The bathroom was remodeled and very modern - they did a great job there. The furniture in the room though was a comical combination of modern minimalism (design of lamps and headboard) with the older traditional style cherry wood dresser which had seen better days. It was as if they had stopped for a lunch break halfway through decorating and forgot to start again. What made it even more challenging was that there was almost too much furniture for such a tiny room That being said ... the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. The staff were so friendly and really made our stay enjoyable. We had breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was delicious. My husband is still talking about the French toast. The menu items are fabulous and wait staff were so nice.

During that interim we have stayed at other hotels downtown. Now, I'm happy to say, the Granville Island Hotel is right back near the top rank of Vancouver hotels. Its location is unsurpassed. The setting of Granville Island is an oasis in the heart of Vancouver. The island's attractions are well known and detailed elsewhere. In addition, let me say that Robson St and downtown is an easy 15-20 minute walk once you cross by Aquabus. And Broadway is just 10 minutes or so in the other direction. Parking is relatively inexpensive at $16 per day, and usually you can park almost adjacent to the entrance. If you can't find a place, the courteous valet will find one when an opening occurs and park the car for you. The convenient parking was a big plus considering all the luggage that we had to schlep inside after 5 months in Asia. Incidentally, the hotel staff were very kind in storing this luggage for us during a three-day absence from the hotel in the middle of a week-long stay. The front-desk staff were very friendly and helpful. They responded well and promptly to email requests and some changes in our reservation before arrival. We arrived at noon after an overnight flight from Japan, and a room was ready for us. Yuko, who was at the desk during much of our stay, was especially helpful and always greeted us by name. This is the way a boutique-style hotel ought to be run. The rooms are well laid out and appointed. Both of the ones we had during our stay had a partial water view, were quiet, and the layout and furnishings were of high quality. The bathroom and shower were excellent. Cleaning staff were thorough and respected \"Do Not Disturb\" requests as we recovered from jet lag. Despite weddings taking place during the long weekend we stayed here, they created no disruption for regular guests (except for some photo shoots in the lobby, which were more interesting than inconvenience). One problem we did experience was an obvious staff shortage in the restaurant one morning. While lined up for a table, one departing party was heard to comment: \"We could wait a hundred years here and still not get served.\" At that point, we decided to head for the Market for our breakfast.

(it's one of our favorite places to stay) - there must have been a woman involved in their en suite designs. In your room, I had to sit at the window and prop up my tiny magnified mirror on our suitcases.

We could not believe the view when we walked into our room. It was outstanding. We didn't even turn on either of the two TV's while there - we just sat and looked out the window at the ever changing scenery. It was very hard to leave. Most everything else about the hotel was great as well - the size of our room, the friendly staff, a great dinner and breakfast, again with outstanding views from the dining room. We only have two comments - we were planning on a \"nightcap\" when we got back from the theatre on a Saturday night at 10:30 - only to discover that both the dining room and the lounge were closed at this early hour. Not what we expected to find in Vancouver. Luckily we had our own wine, and raided the mini bar for some munchies. The only other comment is about the huge trees that are planted directly in front of the million dollar view. Fortunately the trees were not yet in bloom so we still had a great view, but that will be more limited in few weeks.

We love it and it's very hard to upset us when we go back for our visits. Usually, B.C. can do no wrong!! The location of the hotel is great. The front desk staff were wonderful Unfortunately, our room was extremely cramped. The bathrooms are poorly designed. Especially in B.C., with their environmental initiatives, we were surprised that they didn't have towel racks to hang your used towels to dry and the hotel only offered two 'hook's to dry towels. There were two queen beds in the room and it was cramped having two people stay in the room. I couldn't imagine having more than two in the room. We had a wonderful dinner Friday night, celebrating our reunion with our cousin who we hadn't seen in a long time. Jeremy, our waiter, couldn't have been better. He was absolutely wonderful and helped us create a dinner we will never forget. Thank you, Jeremy! You were the best! I wish the same could be said for our breakfasts which were poor. Don't order the shrimp-lemongrass omelette. Instead of using the lemongrass for flavouring, they grind the lemongrass into the omelette and the result is sharp sticks in your mouth and you can't taste the shrimp. Combine that with a waiter who pours coffee across your cup, saucer and table, doesn't come back to ask you how your meal tastes, and you wonder where he was trained. The next day there was a wedding, so we were seated in the lounge for breakfast. There was one waiter working really hard, while ours kept disappearing to use his cell phone. In fact, he didn't even try to hide. We felt sorry for the one waiter still trying to work hard. He was much shorter than our tall waiter, and that's the only way I can describe them.

I'd stayed in Vancouver before and visited Granville Island so thought this would make an ideal place for our first couple of nights in order for my son to see a bit of Vancouver on his first visit to the city. There's always lots to see and do on Granville, even if most places do close early in the evening. The Aqua Bus terminal is a short walk from the hotel and this will whisk you across False Creek into the main part of town in no time. The Hotel was recommended by a friend who stayed there in 2008, prices have risen sharply since then but I decided to go ahead and book it up anyway. Check-in was hassle free and within 10 mins of arriving at the reception we were on our way to our room. The room was nothing special but it was clean and comfortable with a nice bathroom / shower. Reception staff were very helpful and personable - given that we'd just flown into Vancouver and had needed to wear most of our motorcycle gear to travel in from the UK as it was too bulky to pack. We must have looked a fright but they never turned a hair Breakfast wasn't included in the room cost but we ate at the hotel anyway as there's not a lot of choice on Granville for breakfast other than the hotel, the other eating places there don't open up 'til around lunch time. The breakfast served up by the hotel however, was pretty good and there was certainly plenty of it, the waitresses were very helpful and pleasant The only real downside to this hotel is that it isn't cheap, in fact I would say it was quite overpriced for what it offers. Take it away from this location and you have what is quite an ordinary hotel. In fact our room wasn't overlooking the waterfront, so being in there we could have been in any run of the mill corporate hotel in the world. Budget in the pricey breakfast and the cost goes up even more per night. What I did like about the Granville though is that their prices are fully inclusive of taxes so there are no nasty surprises when you come to check out, unlike certain other hotels in Vancouver. This is a hotel I would stay at again, but before booking I would try to negotiate a better deal to get the price down a bit.

So I declared that I was taking the dog and going away for the holiday. My then-love was invited, of course, but he decided to stay home and fulfill his obligation to his family of origin. We had shared a home for over 6 years at this point, so the loyalty to family surprised me a bit but I got over it at this lovely get-away. I discovered the fantastic European-influenced, waterfront, dog-friendly Granville Island Hotel and have been back every year for Christmas Eve through Boxing Day ever since (with one exception.) I make my reservations in August, typically. I arrive early in the day on Christmas Eve to be sure to have plenty of time for the market and other fun shops on the island before they close for the holiday. It's such a wonderful experience! The staff has always been really great -- and I especially love their friendliness and sometimes cheeky humor (or maybe I love that they put up with mine.)

And the hotel is a $10 cab ride from downtown or you can take a water taxi to the edge of the downtown area. Otherwise, it is kind of a humble little hotel. Small personal feel to it. Very accomodating, offering the use of their umbrellas (take one!), pointing out attractions, giving you maps, friendly greetings every day. Friendly and informal. Attached to the hotel is a great little patio restaurant by the water's edge (when weather permits) and a bar/restaurant inside with a mico-brewery. The food is acceptable, but don't expect gourmet. But don't fret, you are in Vancouver, where a new restaurant is born every week.

Granville Island is actually a little peninsula (more like a giant pier) with a very laid back feel to it, complete with a down-home fresh foods market, like something you would see in the movies. There are several shops and plenty of excellent places to eat FRESH seafood, including the Dockside Restaurant and pub (microbrew). The hotel is right on the water (harbor) with a direct view of the hi-rises of Vancouver. There is plenty of pathway to take a romantic walk around the island (on the water) and to observe water traffic. The hotel itself is pretty up-to-date (complete with Internet access) and the staff is very nice and extremely helpful. We stayed in an executive suite, which had a separate living room, and was facing the water and downtown Vancouver... an excellent view. If you're going to stay for more than one night, I would highly recommend spending the extra few bucks for the upgrade. I've stayed in all types, all ratings of hotels around the world and I rank Granville Island Hotel as one of my top picks due to the location and relaxed environment... especially for an adult getaway.", "Date": "June 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "derby", "Title": "\u201c4th rated hotel on Tripadvisor?\u201d", "Author": "sheds", "ReviewID": "UR5304950", "Content": "We stayed at the Granville Island Hotel on 25th May 2006.

The staff was consistently warm and friendly and above all very servicing. The rooms in the section away from the Front Desk by the banquet rooms seemed larger than those in the wing closer to the Front Desk. The bathrooms in the newer section had more counter space to place personal toiletries. That aside, the rooms were very clean and provided all the amenities needed to help make our stay quite comfortable. Hairdryers were provided along with lighted magnifying make-up mirrors (we found in the larger rooms). The mini bar was stocked sufficiently with a wide variety of refreshments and snacks. The Front Desk staff went out of their way to provide excellent directions along with helpful driving tips. The Dockside Restaurant has a beautiful view of the waterfront and the ambiance was warm and contemporary. The food and service were outstanding. What a great plus to have a class-act restaurant located within the hotel. Loved how this hotel is centrally located within Granville Island which made it convenient to walk to nearby art galleries, restaurants, shops and the famous Public Market. Driving to Yaletown, North Vancouver, Stanley Park and other surrounding attractions/destinations made it easy. The computer and printer located in the lobby for guests to use was very helpful. We used it mainly to obtain addresses and directions via Yahoo! or Google Map and simply printed the directions. Another plus was the complimentary high-speed internet access in all the rooms. Whenever we travel, my husband and I bring our laptop and check our emails daily. This also allowed us to research events and activities and various places to visit for the following day.

We didn't want to rent a car, and this location was perfect. A cab from the airport cost around $18 US, and then the rest of the days we used the excellent public transportation system.

The room was the smallest we stayed in during our tour of western Canada, and it was a struggle to fit in a rollaway bed for my son. The rooms are fairly well equipped, and on the surface look good, however the fittings when you look closely at them are not top quality, and will not last. Parking is a problem, and you will probably need to use the valet parking available at the hotel which costs $7. I personally do not think the location is particularly good, you do get a nice view across False Creek, but the downside is that access to the city is difficult. You really are forced to use the ferry boats to get across the creek. This is an enjoyable way to reach the city, but gets expensive if there is a group of you as it costs $2.50 each way. Granville Island itself is very disappointing. Basically a food market and some specialist shops.
