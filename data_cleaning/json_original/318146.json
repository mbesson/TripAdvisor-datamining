The rooms were well appointed and the breakfasts more than fine. We felt we got a good value for our money. Some pluses: Anca - who seems to be the primary housekeeper, and jack of all trades... total sweetheart. Doesn't speak any English but sweet and helpful. Maria - who came and spoke English to us first day, oriented us to our rooms. Breakfast: hot tea, hot milk, delish cornettos (croissant). Super comfy bed on 2nd floor. Great location. Minuses: first floor noise from construction all day Saturday. Sound radiated up to even upper floors. First floor bed not so comfy and shower sort of IKEA-ish. Overall, a good place to stay right in the Ghetto and very near Campo di Fiori. Be sure to try Filete di Bucala around the corner.

The room was comfortable with a good bed which was made afresh every day. There was also aircon and fans which is essential in the hotter weather. The small bathroom with shower, loo, sink was very adequate and the whole room/wc was nicely decorated so no complaints there. Rome is very expensive to 100+ euros a night was very good value and the breakfast was spot on, with fresh coffee, bread, jams pastries etc. The owners were very friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed being able to walk out of the B&B and through the shops in the lovely rome back alleys. There is a daily market just a short walk away where we picked up fresh fruit for our outings and there are plenty of bars, restaurants near by. There river is very close and we walked to the Teatro Marcello for an outdoor concert in the grounds of this mini coloseum like building. The vatican is also fairly close by via a 15 minute along the riverside and even the Forums and coloseum isn't far. All in all, we had a very pleasant stay here. If you don't expect too much you will be pleasantly suprised. If you want luxury we looked at a room in the hotel de russie and they quoted me 1700 euros, so save your money and get good value accomodation, and spend what you save on great dining and expensive attractions. Note. If you go to the vatican don't go for the guided tour. It's a con quite frankly. We waited for 30 mins while they got enough people together, they then lead us to a cash machine outside the vatican so everyone got money out, then on to their tiny office to pay and then finally when we got in there was no queue anyway!

We were in rome for 3 days kicking off our two week Italian vacation. It is in a very vibrant part of town, Campo de Fiori, with good shopping (mostly fashion), cafes and restaurnats. Everything was in walking distance: 10 min to Piazza Novona, 10 min to Pantheon, 30 mins to Villa Borgeses, 40 mins to the Vatican. We only took transit to get to the casa from the train station in Trastevere (there is a train that goes there pretty much directly from the airport, once you get off the train you get on local Rome transit - a tram that takes you accross the Tiber pretty much right to the hotel. I would agree with others who said, the Casa is tucked away - it is behind a mainly pedestrian street witha ll the shops and cafes. This it close to everything, but very quiet at night. The windows face into the centre of the lovely enclosed courtyard, so you will sleep well. There is no outdoor sign, so you must simply use the street address - google it and print a map beforehand. Anna, who was working there during our stay is a lovely girl, and very helpful. She does not speak much english, but is so eagar to please, it did not matter. The owner/host did speak english very well, but we did not see her as often. Rooms are graceful ,decorated with style, and ours had an exposed brick arch which showed how historic the building was. The room has everything you need: wifi, a small fridge, cups, etc. plus a little table to have a snack or nightcap at. It is near the Campo de Fiori: a wonderful, lively market square-good people watching- with many shops and cafes. We first heard of this b&b in Frommers. The breakfast is not included in the room rate, and I didn't particularly like the breakfast, but there was a cafe a few steps away for hte same price you had wonderful cafe late, croisant, and fresh OJ. It is helpful for most b&b owners in Italy if you pay cash. The credit card fees for small business owners are very high.

Specifically, we stayed in the Romantico B&B room, easily able to sleep 4 people. There was a nice king-sized bed upstairs, a sleeper couch downstairs, another single bed upstairs, a nice sized bathroom (and if you've stayed anywhere in Europe, you'll realize what a luxury this is!), and a small kitchen. It was very clean, and the house-cleaning service was fantastic (we had fresh flowers in our vase every day!). The proprietors were very friendly and very helpful. For the location and the price of the apartment (split amongst 4 people), it was truly a bargain. Also, if you're traveling as a group of 4, ask them about their taxi service to and from the airport. The price you'll pay between getting from Fiumicino airport to Termini, and then the bus to Casa Banzo, is almost as much as their taxi driver charges for the 4 of you combined. I think it came out to an extra Euro for each of us -- well worth avoiding the hassle of trekking through Rome with your luggage, especially on the bus (the #64 to boot, a pick-pocket's haven!). The only complaint I could muster up would be with the construction that was going on right next to us. The B&B is growing, and they're converting some of the garages next to us into another apartment. Honestly though, this never bothered us. By the time they started working, we were already awake or out exploring. By the time we got back home, the work was done for the day. It might be a problem if you stopped back for a nap during the day, but ear plugs will solve the problem.
