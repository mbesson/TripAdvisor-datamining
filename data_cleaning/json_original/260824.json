{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice stay in Florence Conveniently located, these rooms to rent are the perfect solution to visit Florence without dilapidating a fortune! It's just a short stroll from down town, right behind the renowned mercato (market) square (a safe area by night too, being owercroweded with tourists!!!). Rooms are in good conditions, although a bit small, and very quiet, as long as they face the backyards. They provide you with all you can need to prepare your very italian colazione (breakfast): tea; instant coffe/cappuccino; espresso; croissants/buiscuits/bread + jam/Nutella. The same philosophy applies to the apt itself: on arrival, they will provide you with the keys to get in any time you want. Cleaned on daily basis.", "Date": "May 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR877925825", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Niqoletta"}, {"Content": "Excellent Place This place is excellent.Is really close from the station, and just a few steps away from Mercato Centrale and Il Duomo.The place is really clean, the suites are new, and with a nice decoration.

Our room was plain and small, and the bathroom is quite small as you would expect in a budget hotel in Florence, but it was clean, a great value, and the location was quite central to all the major attractions in the city. What made the hotel special, though, was the owner, Daniela Pezzati. She was very nice, provided restaurant recommendations that proved to be spot-on, and made us feel quite welcome as first-time visitors to Florence.
