Food is great and souvenir aplenty. Moving around in tram is very convenient in Istanbul Were definitely come back soon and will travel outside Istanbul to explore. Front office manager Sinan Oktem in Romance Hotel is very helpful with the local information. He is very passionate about Turkey culture and willing to share his knowledge.

Booking at the hotel webpage, we have paid 99 euros per night, breakfast included. Given Istanbul's hotel prices at peak season, we think that it is a reasonable price. This is the second time we have chosen this hotel to visit Istanbul. The main reason is that its location is just perfect: Sutanahmet Square (where Santa Sofia and the Blue Mosque are located) and the Egiptian Market are just at a few minutes walk. In addition, there is a tram stop at a few metres (which is quite useful, among other reasons, to go to the airport) and Eminonu piers (from which boats for the Asian neighbourhoods of Istanbul and for the Golden Horn leave) are very close. Both rooms and common areas of the hotel are very clean. Breakfast (taking into consideration the price paid) is very good: good quality and a large enough range of products. One of the best things of the hotel is that the staff (both at the reception and the restaurant) is extremely nice and helpful. My wife and I travel a lot all over the world and we have met a lot of nice people at other hotels, but Romance Hotel's employees' are just second to none. On the negative side, I would say that some rooms are a bit small and could be noisy (because of the tram that passes by). Indeed, the first room that we got was like this; but the staff at the reception changed us the day after, as soon as they got a free room.

It was walking distance to the main sites that interested me. One negative - when I arrived, I was dropped off by the shuttle company at a street behind the hotel and instructed to walk my luggage down to the hotel. I was not expecting this. This was because the street running in front of the hotel is very busy and the trams run along it so vehicles are very limited for drop offs and pick ups. It is very convenient if one wants to catch a tram, which I did and the system is very easy. The first stay, my room was very small with no chairs, table or stool, this was difficult for writing, or working on my computer.

It was actually our honeymoon, as we had just 'eloped' in Italy on the 22nd and then flew straight to Istanbul. We also had our 12 year old daughter with us. The room was very spacious - #111 is apparently the largest. We were disappointed that the suites did not have 2 separate rooms and were quite small, so we opted for the larger room even though we were all in together! The bathroom was also really big - great shower pressure, hot water and very clean. We were asked to hang any towels that we didn't want washed (environmentally conscious) and we did, but they washed them every day anyway! There was a small couch, table, TV & minibar in the room but no tea or coffee making facilities, which would have been preferred. The beds were very comfortable with great pillows, lovely linen (they were made each day) and the room was warm, clean, modern & comfortable. Being on the ground floor there was a bit of street noise - early morning workers & a nightclub nearby that quietened down once a complaint was made. I think you're permitted to smoke in the rooms as we could smell it occasionally in the corridor and our room had an ashtray (we don't smoke), but we didn't see anyone smoking in the foyer or anywhere else. The foyer was lovely - lots of tables & chairs with a TV, a bar and the restaurant. I would like to see some more couches to sit around on in the evening. The breakfast was fantastic with cereals, cooked choices, breads and sweetbreads. The freshly squeezed orange juice was an extra 4TL, which I didn't understand, but it was beautiful. Hotel Romance was in a fantastic location. Right outside the door was a tramlline which took you straight to the Bazaar (amongst other places). The neighbourhood was lovely - lots of hotels, restaurants and shops and easy walking distance to the Bosphorus and Spice Markets. Directly opposite was a fantastic Turkish restaurant - Capadocia - more expensive, but great food and atmosphere. Directly behind the hotel was another fantastic restaurant that was very laid back & cheap and the staff great fun. You could sit outside on couches/pillows to eat, under gas heaters, which was a lot of fun to watch people pass by. Hotel Romance is affiliated with the Hotel next door, which has a restaurant (Olive) with views of the Bosphorus and Blue Mosque. We didn't eat there, but went and had a look. There is also a Turkish Bath there, which we did try - very interesting and quite an experience and glad we did it. I have no idea how much more expensive it is to have one there than elsewhere, but it was about $90-100 AUD. Wifi was free on my iPhone but it was 5TL for half an hour on the foyer's computer. I think this should be free like other hotels. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. We could not fault them - anything we asked they would do. We sat at the bar most evenings and they even allowed us to have our wedding bottle of champagne down there (even though we didn't purchase it from them - that would never happen in Australia!) They would stay and chat and we loved their company or they would leave us to be alone.

My room on the 5th floor of the Romance Hotel was very clean, well maintained and beautifully furnished in line with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s romantic theme. Although this would clearly not have affected other guests staying at the Romance Hotel, I had found my room to be a little on the warm side during the early hours of the morning coming to the hotel from a cold climate such as England and on account of the fan heater in the room being quite powerful - although the temperature can be easily adjusted in the room using the monitor to suit individual preferences once you are familiar with the controls. The duty manager at the hotel responded by offering me a complimentary room upgrade to a larger junior suite on the 3rd floor for the remainder of my stay which had resolved this minor problem to my satisfaction and was very spacious, comfortable and homely. What makes the Romance Hotel so very special and makes it stand out to the vast number of hotels on offer in Istanbul is the sheer warmth and capabilities of the hotel staff; from the very friendly reception to the efficient and highly competent restaurant to the immensely attentive housekeeping. The reception staff, in particular, had simply gone out of their way to make my stay as comfortable as possible. The Romance Hotel is also located in an excellent location with the light railway only a short stroll from the hotel providing ready access to popular parts of Istanbul such as Taxim Square (only a couple of stops away) as well as being within walking distance to tourist hot spots such as the Blue Mosque and Grand Bazaar. I had very much enjoyed the tasteful evening meals delivered to my room with such a lovely smile using the Hotel's room service facilities. I also dined and lunched at the excellent Olive Restaurant located next door in the sister hotel which welcomes guests from the Romance Hotel. When I needed to spend an additional night in Istanbul on 21st December, I did not hesitate to extend my stay at the Romance Hotel and was actually sad to leave behind the exceptionally kind hospitality extended to myself during my stay and the tranquil and very delightful hotel surroundings. Also, the hotel must be considered to be excellent value for money by European standards. Being a boutique hotel, it is expected to be smaller in comparison to the larger chains, however, this in my view actually leads to a much more personal and satisfactory experience at the Romance Hotel. Consequently, I returned to England fully refreshed from my short stay in Istanbul and I am certain that the Romance Hotel was a large contributory factor towards this being a haven of peace, comfort and beautiful surroundings. In summary, I have no hesitation in highly recommending the Romance Hotel to prospective visitors of Istanbul. You simply cannot go wrong in choosing this Hotel for your business or leisurely needs as the hotel staff will take care of your every need. I very much look forward to my next stay at the Romance Hotel in Istanbul and wish the hotel and its fantastic staff many more years of continued and much deserved success.", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cIncredible location and service\u201d", "Author": "Abdullah2005", "ReviewID": "UR90765600", "Content": "The hotel is very centrally located with many tourist locations at walking distance.

It was a a short walk (maybe 10 minutes) to Topkapi Palace, the Aya Sofia, Basillica Cisterns (a must see), the Blue Mosque, and Grand Bazaar (15 minutes). I chose the Romance hotel based on the positive ratings on TripAdvisor and the location. My main concern was comfort and location as my father is in his 80s. We had two double rooms - one was a good size and bigger than I expected, the other was smaller (two twin beds separated by a night stand) and not a lot of extra room. I have travelled extensively in Europe so I knew the rooms would be smaller than US hotels. My sister and Mom commented on how nice the bathroom was. The breakfast was much better than we expected. There are plenty of restaurants on the street behind the hotel, and shops as well. The Romance is part of a group of hotels all near each other. We had dinner at the Olive Restaurant in one of the other hotels based on the staff's recommendation. It was a rooftop with a nice view of the Aya Sofia. It was a buffet, and felt a little touristy (there was a tour group there, and it was one of the few places we saw Americans on the trip). It was a little pricey for a buffet, but the food was quite good, the service was very good and they even brought out soup for no charge when my dad asked if it was possible to get a cup. The restaurant also had a regular menu we could have ordered from. While it was a good meal, and a decent price, we would have rather had a more authentic dining experience. The hotel staff were friendly, particularly Ugur (a bell hop I think who walked us around the corner to the other hotel for dinner). You can book sightseeing tours from the hotel (a plus), although it felt like one front desk clerks was pushing us to take the Topkapi tour even after we said we weren't interested because the tour didn't include seeing the Harem (which is the most interesting part of the palace). We did book a 1/2 day tour through the hotel for a Bosporus cruise and that was worth it. I would recommend this hotel - it is neat, clean, a good value in an excellent location.

First the Location cannot be beaten \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it is central to everything a sightseeing tourist desires!! Just outside and to the right of the hotel (~5 NYC blocks or 8 Chicago blocks) is the Blue Mosque, shopping, Hagai Sophia, shopping, many Turkish restaurants and side walk vendors, the Grand Bazaar, shopping, the double decker tour buses, etc., Did I mention loads of shopping? Turn left from the hotel (within 4 NYC blocks/6 Chicago blocks) and this will lead you to the Spice Bazaar, and for those who MUST eat McDONALDS, yes one is there, Bosphourous tours, shopping, Many Turkish restaurants, Mosques, Orient Express train station, banks with ATM (word of caution \u00e2\u20ac\u201c best to use the ATMs during the bank business hours or do a cash advance using the teller with your ATM if have mastercard logo; I had an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153incident\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd but was corrected once I got home). AND for those areas just a bit outside Sultanamet, well, the TRAM station is ~100m to the right of the hotel or you can venture out on the Orient Express train. Accommodations - The hotel room was small, but very clean. The bathroom is very modern and after a long day, the high powered shower heads was welcoming to my tired body. I also had a room next to the elevator which was super quiet \u00e2\u20ac\u201c did not disturb me at all. Honestly, we spent very little time in the rooms except to sleep and store our goods from shopping. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet tremendously!! After fueling up in the morning, we did not need to eat again until it was time for dinner\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6even with all the walking we did! The buffet had something to suite anyone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s taste \u00e2\u20ac\u201c boiled eggs, egg over easy, scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, variety breads, pastries, fruits, variety fruit preserves, coffee, orange juice among many other foods\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.and ofcourse tea!! Atmosphere \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was surprised at just how friendly all the Turks are...seriously! Not sure what I expected\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6.but totally enjoyed the warmth of the folks at Romance hotel when I first arrived and it seem to have spilled out to all of Istanbul! Let me tell you, Sinan, the front desk manager, is a precious GEM!! He is very knowledgeable\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and if you listen to him, you will not go astray and guaranteed a fabulous time! All his recommendations were superb and top notch! From the trip to Izmir (Ephesus and Pamukkle) to our return and the Turkish night out experience at the Orient Express! He even knew the best place for my friend to get a fabulous haircut!! Sehmat (I think I spelt his name correctly, tall thin guy with black hair and dark rimmed glasses) was very kind and quick to offer help even when we had questions late at night! The whole crew at Romance Hotel loves their job and it shows\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and they do it very well! I will be returning to Istanbul as I still have more places to visit\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and yes more shopping too! I will definitely be staying at the Romance Hotel! Thanks Guys!

I have been to Istanbul a few times and stayed in various Hotel including the Ritz Carlton and Conrad, but this time decided to stay in The Romance Hotel in Sultanehmet. Here is my full review: Location: I was travelling with my family, so it was important for them to be within easy reach of all the Old City attractions, and important for me to be able to get around without Taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Romance Hotel is literally 1 minute from Gulane Station, and so getting around was easy. I walked to the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and Hagia Sophia in 10 mins. Sultanehmet Main road and Grand Bazaar is a 25 minute walk. A very enjoyable walk though even though it was pouring down with rain when we were there. Location is VERY SAFE even at night and extremely central, Tram Station is really convenient. Once at night I took the tram in the pouring rain to Sultanehmet, 1 stop to buy delicious cakes, I was there and back in 20 mins. If you want to be in easy walking reach of all of the Old City you cannot ask for a more convenient location. Hotel Services / Staff The Romance Hotel staff are amazing, because they are efficient and knowledgeable. They all speak English and are really friendly. I stayed in a Suite which was comfortable and spacious. I was greeted every morning by smiling faces, they do a great job of making your stay comfortable. The hotel also has a salon and Turkish bath for some serious papering. Breakfast: Breakfast is pretty typical for Istanbul, with lots of cold meats, cheeses, yogurt, fresh fruit, lots of breads and real fresh jams. Tea / Coffee and a small menu of hot food like boiled and fried eggs, fried potatoes, mushrooms as well as hot traditional Turkish pastries (Spinach, Feta Cheese \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Yummy). \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6etc. Very healthy and plentiful. Great way to start the day. There were always 2 - 3 waiting staff around to help and fresh juices available on request. Local Restaurants / Shops Right outside the Hotel there is a selection of shops, and some amazing Restaurants. The hotel itself has a restaurant located opposite which is fantastic, and Faros restaurant next door is pretty good too. Within walking distance there are pretty much any shop you can imagine, and a wide selection of Restaurants. In conclusion, I have stayed at a few five star hotels in Istanbul, but found their location to be appalling for leisure, hours in taxi\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s in Istanbul traffic. I will \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdefinitely\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 be staying at The Romance Hotel again. I found its convenience and location to be perfect.

My wife and I love this hotel. We have had good stays at all of our other hotels, but this one is by far the best. We are here on something of a 2nd honeymoon, and this hotel has made all the difference for us. It is located right across from the tram (above ground metro), right in the center of a number of restaurants and shops, and only several blocks from the Blue Mosque, and other historic sites. The narrow stone roads give the neighborhood a wonderful cozy feel. And everything is in reach -- one night my wife and I wanted to eat out at a fancy restaurant, and we only had to cross the street. I wanted to buy some fresh bread one morning, and there was a bakery only 3 doors down. I often go to the Mosque to pray, and there are many nearby including the famous Blue Mosque. Yesterday, I needed an adaptor for my laptop, and there was a electronics shop down the street... although in this case, the hotel was kind enough to lend me their adaptor free of charge. :-) The service is excellent. Their hospitality is great, as it is everywhere in Istanbul. They are concerned for you as a guest, and they don't nickel and dime you -- service is there when you need it and given graciously. Among their accommodations, the wireless internet here is better than my internet at home.. true high speed internet. They have a fitness center, which we didn't actually use, and they have \"tea time\" in the afternoon... unlimited tea and cake for a small price. Clean, spacious rooms are very important for me and my wife. Fortunately, the rooms are very clean, especially the bathroom. The bathroom is sizable, which is an issue at all of our other hotels. It includes a shower and a tub with a spa-like space on the side to sit and wade your feet in the water. They even provided robes. A nice addition is that the room service is intelligent. The rooms have a smart system that lets the room service know if you are in the room or not. They only clean the room if you are not there, and it makes a big difference to not be disturbed if you are sleeping in. Finally, I would like to comment on the breakfast, which is several courses and huge compared to all our other hotels. I especially love the apple tea that they serve and the great meats. I would like to recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Istanbul -- especially if you are coming on your honeymoon, since they will make special accommodations for you.

It's a great part of the city to stay in as you are round the corner from the main tourist attractions (Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Cistern). It is half way between these and the bridge crossing over to the Galata Tower and the new city. It just had a nicer vibe round there than in some other areas. Was a little more relaxed but that's relaxed in Istanbul terms, with Istanbul being a very busy city. I could only really fault the place on the comfort of the beds. They were fine, a little creeky, reasonably comfortable but I've stayed in slightly better. Having said that, it really wasn't a problem and I would definitely stay there again, without a doubt.

My friend and I booked the hotel through an external website and we were led to believe that the hotel was a '4 star luxury boutique hotel'. Part of the reason why we were disappointed was admittedly due to the fact that we had been missold, but the rest of the bad review is due to the hotel itself. Not all was bad, but the bad points outweighed the good... When we arrived at the hotel we were impressed that the receptionist was very friendly. We're sure if we needed advice about tours he would have been the best person to go to..we didn't though because we prefer more independent travel. Then...we were shown to our room! TINY does not begin to describe it! I'm not saying I wanted palatial standards, and was expecting cozy, but this was incredibly small. It was room 202, and 2 tiny beds were fitted barely 40cm apart from each other. We weren't too happy so we asked if there was an alternative room but there wasn't. We were told we could store our suitcases for us (there was seriously no room for these in the room!) without us having to climb over the beds to get to the door). We did comtemplate this, but since there was one small wardrobe in the room we couln't take up this option. Some of our clothes stayed in our suitcases instead and we took them out as and when we needed them. The first night we slept we had an awful sleep because the springs in the bed were digging into our back. We tried to see if we could get used to it, but after the 3rd night with 3 restless sleeps we spoke to the friendly receptionist. He seemed sympathetic, but we knew nothing would happen...they were hardly going to buy a new bed just for us. The other problem with the room was that the bathroom was tiny as hell, and the shower door was broken. Once again we mentioned this to the receptionist...he said he would pass it onto the manager but yet again nothing was done. We just got used to having a shower with the door open but this meant that the water went all over the bathroom floor. The breakfast was okay...it wasn't bad by any means, just extremely limited. Cheese, some some spam-like ham, salad and bread, plus cornflakes with dried fruit, and coffee/tea/squash. We went there for the first 2 mornings, but didn't bother after that, and decided to simply eat breakfast out. I'm not quite sure where the raving reviews came from...maybe I expect too much from my food or something? :-) The hotels saving graces were that is was clean, the reception was friendly and it had an excellent location. It was right in the heart of Sultanhamet with the Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque and Agis Sophia close by. We used the tram line lots to get to more out of the way and really enjoyed Istanbul. It has to rate as one of my favourite destinations and will definately go back. I'll be posting seperate reviews on Istanbul later. To summarize..I'm sure that other people had better experiences because their rooms were of a far superior quality. Ours should have been classed as a single bedroom...and then it would have been fine. As a twin room though, it's vastly overpriced and it's shameful that any establishment should try and market itself as such - and I'm no hotel snob and have had great experiences in Ibis and Travelodge hotels, along with family B+B's. I'll go back to Istanbul for sure...just not here!", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cClean hotel, lovely staff, perfect location\u201d", "Author": "LibertytripS", "ReviewID": "UR31936253", "Content": "I have visited Istanbul before and knew I wanted a hotel close to the centre of the Old City with the Blue Mosque etc in easy walking distance.

The staff were helpful and polite. We were picked up by airport transfer in a very grand car and the rooms were clean and pretty. Ours had a large balcony too.

If you are in Istanbul for the weekend then this is the perfect place as its close to everything you'd want to see and the staff really help you out. My top suggestion for Istanbul is to visit the Seven Hills Hotel's roof terrace. Its the highest point between the Blue Mosque and Haigha Sophia and the staff are super-helpful and friendly.

Make sure you use the fernicular (which is just over the bridge, on the left), as it is much easier than walking up the steep hill! We didn't realise it existing until we'd been there a while! There are lots of great little kebab houses to eat at - we found an absolute gem of a place just before we left for the airport. It was in the Sultanhamet district and it had just opened. It doesn't look like much from outside and it was in the centre of quite a touristy area, but the food was absolutely FANTASTIC! The owners were also really lovely and they were very proud to tell us about how the food is prepared (using the 'knife' method, which is apparently the traditional way to prepare the food, and we didn't see this anywhere else). You really must go and support this little new business - it is called 'Sultanahmet Bufe Restaurant' and is just off the main road (Divan Yolu Cadessi), on a little street called 'Cadessi Bickiyurdu'. It's number 1 along that road (at the end). Fabulous! The hotel was lovely - we had a huge comfy bed and black-out curtains, which meant we slept like babies!

I chose the Romance Hotel mostly based on the reviews and location. I actually booked a hotel at a more expensive place and canceled due to reviews on this site. I am so glad I did. First of all, the staff was extremely helpful during my stay. I was able to check in at noon the first day and was immediately greeted at the door with someone to carry my bags. The man in charge of reception, Sinan, and the rest of the staff were very patient through my thousands of questions over the last 6 days of my stay. I'm actually in the lobby writing this while waiting for my ride to the airport, of which they arranged along with every tour. A good example of their hospitality happened the first night. I realized I was out of tooth paste and went down to the lobby to see if they had any, as they said when I checked in that it was available. They had a quick look and realized they were out. I said no problem and would just go buy some. They emphatically said no and the manager rushed out the door to their sister hotel and brought tooth paste back to me within 5 minutes. Its the little things like this that make the difference for me. Besides the staff and the fantastic price there are a few more reasons as to why this is a great place. First, the location was ideal. it is located on the tram line, which for someone as directionally challenged as my self, was ideal. If you walk out the front door and take a right following the tracks you get first to Toptika Palace in five minutes, then Sultanahmet Square (Aya Sofia, Blue Mosque...) in eight minutes, and another ten minute walk to the Grand Bazaar - all by following the one train line from your hotel. The other direction will take you to Sirkeci and Galata and some great food and music on the Pier. Of course, for $.80 you can just ride the tram to locations and save your legs a little. There are good restaurants within a block (try Han Kebab House towards Sultanahmet - great food and excellent staff). Another reason I'm recommending this place is the breakfast. The quality is much better than most hotel breakfasts I've had. Perhaps they have upgraded their selection, but the simple bread and cereal selection I've read on other reviews was nonexistent. They had eggs, warm cheese pastry, good yogurts, jams, and tea. I was expecting much less. The rooms are small but very clean and nicely laid out. I had a flat screen tv with a few channels in english, and a nice big window facing the street. The reception is open 24 hours, something you don't always find in boutique hotels. There are some good shops within a block where you can get water and basic snacks -and even a wonderful baklava shop within five minutes. if you aren't expecting a four star American hotel, but rather a nice, clean hotel with a professional staff, great location, and good price, I highly recommend the Hotel Romance.

Different kinds of cheese, olives, fresh vegetables, b\u00c3\u00b6rek, turkish \u00c3\u00a7ay, kahve etc. b)And, of course, pink carnations :) i noticed... they looked so nice and always fresh :) c)and quietness... i enjoyed the quietness of the mornings while staying there. i felt so relaxed and comfortable. I returned to the Hotel late at night - and again i felt that calmness and hospitality. We used to sit with my friend in the restaurant area, having a small relaxed talk, drinking turkish coffee. Third thing - atmosphere... I already mentioned... I never had such a nice feeling of quietness. Fourth - also i noticed (in the morning while having breakfast) that many French and Italian tourists preferred to stay at the RH, also saw some Americans. It was nice to see them there. The worst thing that happened to me at RH was that 4 days flew by like one moment and i didn't want to leave... Everything about Romance Hotel was so romantic... At that time i needed that.... That's why this hotel was a perfect match for me!!! I just wanted to say \u00c3\u2021ok Te\u00c5\u0178ekk\u00c3\u00bcrler Ederim to all those nice people who made my staying so enjoyable and unforgettable!

A few doors down from The Romance are little multi-purpose stores to get your water and milk and even the odd gift items! For a great shopping experience, step into The Millennium opposite where the bewildering choice of ceramics and carpetswill blow your mind.

At about 4.30pm we arrived at the hotel from the airport and the receptionist Ramazan greeted us with welcome Mr Ginwalla and that made it so personal. He had not even looked at any of our paperwork, it was all there on the computer. We were shown to our rooms and they provided us with three beds in each room and one room even had a large balcony. The rooms were very good size. This meant they had taken into consideration our family size and upgraded us without extra cost! The service was excellent and all historic sites within walking distance, the staff very pleasant and attentive and the breakfast in the morning each day was very well laid out and plenty of choice. Our children who are aged 17, 15, 9 and 7 enjoyed the whole expereince and said how much they liked staying at the Romance. For visitors staying at the Romance, I would recommend that they use tours provided by others and not use the hotel, as it will be expensive. There are plenty of people at the historic sites who will show you around for a very cheap price but do remember to haggle. The road that Romance is located has a very good supermarket and you could get your water, and other essentials at a very cheap price from there. There is also an internet cafe just down the road heading towards Eminouno at a place called the point, and you can get an hours internet for just 2 turkisk lira.

We stayed at Romance a total of six nights from Saturday June 28, 2008 until Friday July 4, 2008. We had a double room on the 3d floor facing the back. The room was simple normal size for a similar type hotel, extremely clean with a tv, full bathroom and good size closet. There was construction across the street but thanks to the double pane windows (or other miraculously effective sound insulation) we did not hear a thing and slept in till 10:30 most days. Breakfast is served till 10 and we had it a couple days. It is a great spread and very attentive service. Besides the comfortable room, great sleep and informed concierge service by Sinan the Great, I highly recommend Romance for its location. On the tram line in Sultanahmet, it is perfectly located for a full exploration of Istanbul. Alot of hotels listed on hotels. com are behind the blue mosque in an area only developed around tourism. Romance on the other hand is in a real part of town where you have many tourists but alot of Istanbullus. Romance is still a short walk away from the Ayasofia, Topkapi Palace and the Blue Mosque but is also a short walk from Eminonu, the gateway to Taksim, the Asian shore and the Bosphorous villages. There is a market next door with all sorts of essentials. On the walk from Romance to Eminonu there is also a bank and a pharmacy. Most important though is a great backlava shop on the north side of the street! Rooftop bars are an essential part of any experience in Istanbul and while Romance does not have one, the staff is quick to direct guests to the bar of its sister hotel, 10 meters away, the Olive bar. With breathtaking views of the Ayasofia, the Olive bar lured us nighlty for a pre-dinner drink. Finally there is a beanie Nargileh bar on the pedestrian cobblestone street behind the hotel.

I had decided to stay here based on other reviews on Tripadvisor and I must say I made the right choice. The hotel is in a great location, 5 mins walk from Topkapi Palace and Haghia Sophia, 10 mins walk from the Blue Mosque and maybe 10-15 to the port to take the Bosphorus Cruise. The hotel is a nice property on 5 floors with lift. Rooms are clean but not big. Considering that we didn't plan to stay in our room all the time it wasn't a problem. There are a minibar and also a safe in the rooms (safe free of charge). Sheets and towels are clean, only thing I didn't like was the carpet, a bit old/dirty looking (I'm allergic to dust, so hate carpets in general, unless brand new!)The bathroom has bathtub with shower and hairdryer and it was spotless clean. The hotel is on a small street where the tram passes, but since the tram is quite modern I didn't experience noise at night, the windows are fairly new and isolate from the outside noise quite well. Breakfast was just ok, it looks like croissants are not very popular in Istanbul (couldn't even find them at the airport!) but there was a good choice of bread, cake, jam (even a type of jam for diabetic people), eggs, cheese, olives. There is a restaurant but we never tried it, as there are many restaurants as soon as you walk out of the hotel. Outside the hotel there are plenty of souvenir shops, restaurants, and also a pharmacy. The hallways in the hotel were smelling a bit of smoke (like most places in Istanbul) which may be annoying for non-smokers. Also, most small restaurants in Istanbul don't have a non-smoking area so keep that in mind and choose outside seating areas, or you will cough throughout dinner! Overall we had a very enjoyable stay at this hotel, the location is perfect and the staff is very friendly and they speak good english. Piece of advise when travelling back from Istanbul: on the way back we had to queue for almost 2 hours at the airport: as soon as you get to the airport you have to go through security: 6am and it was absolutely packed! You have to screen everything before you got to your check-in counter. Once you pass the security check you go to the check in counter and realize that the Turkish Airline flight to London has only 1 counter opened for about 200 people! Another queue. Once you check in you go through passport control. One more queue. You think you are done? Nope! To go to your gate you have to pass another screening and this time taking also your shoes off (why not doing it at the beginning???). Fourth queue. After that you just have one more passport control (fifth queue) before you can finally reach the gate and have your boarding pass checked before flying home!

Quite a few shops on the street towards the harbour, where you can find better prices than in the Grand Bazar, if you are not the most experienced haggler. I can reccomend \"Ida gift shop\", wich is on the opposite side of the street from the hotel.
