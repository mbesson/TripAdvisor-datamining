Location is super (walking distance to restaurants, staples center, movie theater, etc.) but service was terrible. Arrived in our room to find the door open and maintenance technician working on the mini bar. He offered that he would be done in a few minutes and barked into his walkie talkie at someone about how \"guests are in the room\". We awkwardly sat down on the bed and watched him take the fridge apart for a few minutes. We suggested we switch rooms. He agreed it was probably a good idea and complained to us about the front desk clerk. Apparently complaining about his coworkers to the customer made good business sense to him. It was important to him that we understand that he didn't make a mistake--it was the front desk clerk. We returned to the lobby with all of our luggage. They switched our room to a different floor. When we opened that door we were hit with strong odor of cigar smoke. It was so strong that we looked out the window to see if we were above the smoking area. No butt hut under us so we called front desk and asked if we had been put into a smoking room. They said no and offered to move us again. This time they sent someone to the room with keys so we wouldn't have to truck down the small elevator with all of our bags. The third room was better--clean, no odors or maintenance techs. We wondered what type of inconvenience would qualify us for a free upgrade to a suite, but figured that since they didn't offer, maybe it was better to stick with the current room. The next morning I went to the lobby for the free coffee advertised in the room binder. At 6:30 a.m. there was no coffee. At 7:45 a.m. there was no coffee. I phoned the front desk at 8:00 and asked if they still offered free coffee as advertised. She said \"Oh yes, it'll be here at 9 today.\" Why bother? Also disturbing was the \"danish\" mentioned in the binder--bagged pastries that should have been in a vending machine. (Come on, even twinkies would have gotten a better review from me.) The next morning I asked the front desk for help printing out some tickets for an event. They said the concierge would be in at 10 a.m. I stopped to meet her at around 10:30. I explained that I needed access to a printer when I made the purchase. She looked confused and asked me to email her whatever I needed printed. I explained that I needed to print my receipt when I made the purchase in order to attend the event. She said, \"Well I don't know how I could help you with that. I have this laptop that isn't connected to a printer. I can only print something that you would email to me.\" I said \"Forget it, we will find another location where we can print.\" We had originally planned to stay for 5 nights but left after 3 nights. This was the earliest I could adjust our plans to a different hotel due to the conference schedule. No one asked us if we enjoyed our stay upon checkout and I did not offer how disappointed we were with all levels of service. I would not stay here again. We wondered how they stay in business and decided that they must be relying on single night stays due to events at Staples center.", "Date": "May 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cabove average room in downtown LA\u201d", "Author": "Ruei", "ReviewID": "UR129063057", "Content": "i recently stayed in the luxe for a few nights as i was attending a conference in downtown LA. on the plus sides, the location is really convenient (walking) to downtown LA, the staples center, and the (chain) restaurants nearby. even though you can walk to these places, other than staples center and the restaurants nearby like the espn zone, trader vics, etc, i probably wouldn't walk around at night. the hotel room was really nice. pretty large with a king-sized bed and modern updated bathroom. the bathroom didn't have a tub, but the shower was great, with both a handheld and overhead downpour style. overall the bathroom was pretty small, but stylish. the amenities in the room were above average. good wireless connection, flat-screen tv, keurig coffee machine. however your options are either to have a little more street noise and face figueroa, or face a parking lot in the back. the restaurant on the second floor is in construction, so there's no food or bar options right now, but you're right across the street from many many selections. i think once the renovations take place, the rating could go up to a 4.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hailey, Idaho", "Title": "\u201cNice....but\u201d", "Author": "TiffanieH", "ReviewID": "UR128998494", "Content": "Nice Hotel, interesting what can be done to a former Holiday Inn.

It is located just across the street from the Staples Center / Nokia Theater / LA Live Area and easily within walking distance of most of the downtown area. The hotel also has convenient access (through a 10 min drive) to the USC Campus (visiting campus was the purpose of my stay). Room - Upon arrival, we were upgraded to a suite (king bed in one room + living room / kitchenette in another room) which wasn't expected. The suite was spacious in the bedroom and living room. The bathroom was a bit on the smaller side, but didn't bother too much. Rooms in the suite were all extremely clean and put together. Service - We stayed at the hotel for only two nights, but all hotel employees that we encountered were extremely friendly and accommodating. We did not ask for housekeeping during the day after our first night since we arrived late and were in the hotel during the day. Housekeeping noticed and called the room to make sure that we did not need service and asked if we needed clean towels - a gesture not seen at many comparable hotels. Amenities - Parking ($25 per night - self-park or valet) was readily available immediately next to the hotel for convenient access. The lot is spacious and there were plenty of spots. The main downside of this hotel was lack of a couple amenities. I believe that they are doing some type of renovation, so the closure should be temporary. The fitness center was closed and the onsite laundry was temporarily unavailable for repairs. Also, they are building / renovating something on the outside of the hotel, but I'm not sure what that was. The Luxe does not have a pool which is a downside if looking for some relaxation in busy downtown. In the end, I would definitely consider staying at Luxe City Center next time I am in the area.

So we have stayed in our fair amount of rooms in the area over the years. This one was a very pleasant surprise. Think boutique hotel. it is only 8-9 floors so you are not lost in a mega hotel and service is great since the place isn't the size of a small city. This place has gone through some major renovations. I heard it used to be a holiday inn although all remnants of that are gone. It is clean, nicely styled, and a pleasure to stay at. We upgraded to an executive suite and were very glad we did. It was spacious, tastefully decorated and had a comfortable city apartment vibe instead of your standard hotel room experience. The bed was very comfortable and the rain shower was a very nice touch. As for convenience to the area, you can't beat this especially if you are going to an event at Staples Center as we were. It is just across the street as is the Grammy Museum and LA Live. It is also right next to El Cholo restaurant (behind it) which is a LA staple that has been there since 1923 and down the street from the Pantry, another LA staple. The pantry for breakfast and El Cholo for dinner is a great day. This hotel does not have a restaurant yet so that means no room service either at the moment. The girl at the front desk said April it would be done. We were a little bummed but it ended up having zero effect on our visit when we took count of the countless amazing places within walking distance. Another huge bonus for the smokers and the initial reason I found and booked this hotel. They have smoking rooms available upon request! This is a fairly big deal as a lot of hotels have gone to a smoke free policy. A smoking option is good for both smokers and non smokers alike. I have found that when smoking rooms are not available that there is always a little group that are forced to go right outside the lobby doors since they can't in their room. Inconvenient for us and not pleasant for those that dont smoke.

Newly renovated with super comfy bed, very chic furniture, comfortable sitting chair, nice energy saving features (that were also very friendly to use), great HD TV, free internet (wireless), and they even had evening turn-down service with chocolates, bottled waters, comfy foam slippers. The room was modern, sophisticated, very user friendly with plugs everywhere for my computer and cell phone, and a very relaxing place to be. Bathroom: A- - Rain shower head!!! with option to switch to hand-held. Previously water pressure was discussed as low - I did not have this problem. The water pressure was perfect. The sink was ultra-modern design and nice to look at but kind of got water everywhere, so not the best functionality. I gave bathroom an A minus because it also lost points for the bathroom products. The body wash and shampoo just kind of seemed watered down; the way the rest of the bathroom looks, I expected better presentation and quality of the bath products. Lobby: D+ - undergoing renovations as previously stated. I only needed it to check-in and meet my colleagues, but the smell of paint was pretty strong. I am sure it will get better once finished, but for right now, it's a mess and not very welcoming. Check-In: C - I'm being nitpicky here, but especially with a not pretty lobby they should want to move people through. I had to wait about 10 minutes to be helped...and I was 2nd in line. There were another 4 people behind me. Finally, the agent at the desk asked for help and 3 other agents started checking people in. For a de\"Luxe\" hotel (I had to sneak at least one of those in my review), I would expect that help should not have to be asked for - people should be monitoring that. And if nobody is monitoring, then the agent should be more proactive about asking for help before a long line forms. Location: A - right across the street from Nokia Theatre and Staples Center, easy walk to all downtown locations. The subway is a 5-10 minute walk (depending on how fast or slow you go). I had taken Amtrak to Union Station and it was a $15 cab ride to the hotel. I took the subway back and it was a faster ride (if you exclude walk to subway) and only $1.50. OVERALL: B+ - Overall, the experience is almost an A, mostly because of the most important part of a hotel for me, which is the room itself. And the room at the Luxe is incredible. They did it right, in my opinion, with the upgrade to what used to be a Holiday Inn. They did the rooms first and are doing the rest later. I hate it when a hotel has a beautiful lobby but the rooms are old and dingy - it almost feels like false advertising. But at the Luxe, they took care of the guest first and are redoing the rest now. I do wish the place had a pool. But overall, despite being an SPG and Marriott Rewards member, when I stay downtown LA again, it will be at the Luxe.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cStayed two nights at the Luxe\u201d", "Author": "Sue F", "ReviewID": "UR119552840", "Content": "If you want to stay in a completely pristine room, this is the place to stay.

BUT, in their hotel greeting book, it stated that the room service was coming soon. The hotel was fairly quiet also.

No one had any idea what I was talking about; (3) When I left my room, I saw the cleaning lady for my floor as I had been working in my room all day, I asked her to clean my room since I was leaving for a few hours and gave her the tip directly; my room was NOT CLEAN when I returned and apparently, the cleaning lady's shift had ended; (4) Finally, I gave them a box to FedEx back to my office on Saturday. I contacted and spoke twice with the Bell Desk who assured me that the box would be sent out on Saturday for Monday morning delivery. The box had the correct label on it, the only thing left to be done was to tape up the box and call FedEx. I have done this at half-a-dozen hotels in the last three months, with no issue. THE BOX WAS NOT HERE ON MONDAY and upon calling the hotel, some other bellman is telling me that the box was shipped out today per my instruction, which is complete BS. However, NO ONE AT FEDEX HAS ANY RECORD OF THE BOX BEING PICKED UP FROM THIS HOTEL ON MONDAY AND NO ONE CURRENTLY KNOWS WHERE THE BOX IS.

We were back in town in October for an event at Staples Center. The Marriott was booked so we decided to reserve here. Learned that it had changed hands and was being renovated, but Website made no mention of several key issues: there was currently no pool, fitness center, bar, restaurant, room service, or food of any kind at the hotel--no vending machines; empty mini bars. Oh wait--a bowl of apples at the front desk. Granted, LA Live is across the street, and LA Bite will deliver, but still. Charging full-amenity prices ($260 per night) for a hotel with few amenities--not cool. Rooms had been nicely renovated and were pretty comfortable, other than a weird oversized painting of Madonna on the wall. We were relaxing in the room in our pjs after dinner when my daughter looked up and saw an enormous cockroach crawling along the crown moulding. She's a bug-phobe and I'm not, but this bug was scary even to me. Front desk sent a very nice maintenance man to help us change rooms, but when he tried to kill the roach he lost sight of it and it crawled up his arm, then flew right at my face -- creepy! My daughter wanted us to move to the Marriott, which now had rooms available, but it was late and seemed like a lot of hassle at the time. The room to which we were switched was pretty clean but obviously hadn't been used in a while-- It was dusty. The toilet seat was half-detached from the commode, which was a bit of a shock. When I called the front desk to have this fixed (very nice maintenance guy to the rescue again), I was told we would be given 50% off our stay to make up for our negative experiences. That seemed fair as we were staying two nights. My daughter still really wanted to switch hotels, but since they were adjusting the price I thought we should stay. Rest of the stay was okay, although it was hard to sleep thinking about huge cockroaches. Upon checkout, I found that we'd been discounted 50% off one night and charged full price for the second--not what I'd been told. Mentioned this to the clerk, who called the manager. Manager didn't bother to talk to me at all, just told the clerk to call the manager who'd been on duty our first night. This manager, who also didn't bother talking to me, said it was a \"waterbug\", not a cockroach, and we were only to get 50% off the one night. The clerk was polite and apologetic but said there was nothing she could do. Note to managers: One of your primary tasks is customer contact, especially when your guests have problems with their stay. Also, cockroaches are still cockroaches even when you call them waterbugs, and it is not good when they appear in guest areas of your establishment. I called Luxe's corporate offices after I got home and my bill was promptly adjusted to what I had been offered. Apparently the ownership change is still in progress, and even though Luxe's logo appears everywhere, it's not fully a Luxe property yet.

My company sentenced me to a four night stay at the hotel, and on the second to last night the hotel\u2019s front desk staff claim the city\u2019s DWP cut power to the building until what coworkers said was 2-4am. The hotel still had lights in the lobby and hallways, as well as a functioning elevator. Unfortunately they lacked any generator to power the guest rooms. I left for the night and went to a hotel across the street. At checkout it was a struggle trying to convince the hotel not to charge me for parking as I did not park my car at the hotel that night. Apparently they have no way to check their parking garage, and instead take your word for it. The staff, whether holdovers from the previous incarnation or not, seemed to still possess a Holiday Inn mentality. At check-in the front desk clerk got snippy with me when I requested additional room keys because of the hotel\u2019s system that powers the guest room lights and air conditioner. I also found that I\u2019d keep the key in the sensor to continue running electricity in the room, but the staff would apparently stop by rooms to remove the key and place it just above the sensor. So, I\u2019d return and no lights would work and the room would be in the mid 70s -vs- the 60s I set it for. The bedding albeit nice, was dirty and appeared to have blood or other heavy stains soaked into them, that continue to be washed and cycled through guests. The 16x9 lcd screen was a waste, as they had no true HD programming available. So all the money spent on the new TV\u2019s is only wasted on programming that is grainy, distorted and lacks the correct aspect ratio. Funny that for a hotel directly across the street from ESPN\u2019s newest HD studio, the ESPN signal received at the hotel looks awful. The bathroom and shower were very modern and you could tell they were recently renovated. Though I found the sink to be awkward. The sink design is rooted more in style than function. The entire bathroom countertop becomes a pool in water that doesn\u2019t make it to the sink. For something as simple as washing hands or brushing teeth. The sink\u2019s faucet is even worse it\u2019s tough to find the right temperature without defined controls. The shower design is modern and stylish and a departure from bath/shower combos. It features a selectable rain water, or handheld showerhead. The water pressure was weak, almost laughable. Internet was free, and at decent speeds, parking was $25 for self park (July 2010) in a garage littered with renovation construction materials. The hotel lacks a restaurant, bar and room service during the renovation (July 2010) but the location is great, because across the street is the LA Live outdoor mall with a half dozen restaurants. Two blocks east of the restaurant is the 24hr \"Original Pantry,\" greasy spoon diner.

However, it\u2019s downtown Los Angeles. With the cost of real estate here, I\u2019m not expecting a sprawling amount of space. I thought the d\u00e9cor was somewhat dated. The crown molding along the ceilings is a nice touch. However, I found the light-wood inserts on the dark-wood furniture to look more tacky than tasteful. Not a big deal, though. I find few business-class hotels with exciting d\u00e9cor. What bothered us the most was the complete lack of soundproofing. We could clearly hear conversations (both in Spanish and English) and normal \u201cbumping around\u201d noises from the adjoining rooms (and the one above us). Door-banging noises seemed much louder than average. Those were the noises inside the hotel. In terms of exterior noise, I expect to hear sirens and traffic noise in an urban setting, but it bothered my daughter\u2019s sleep (and we faced away from Figueroa Blvd). The Holiday Inn has high-speed internet, but it is not wireless. That means you\u2019re tethered to the one high-speed cord located on the desk (which is uncomfortably located too close to the HVAC unit, so you get a direct blast of hot or cold air). That also means only one person at a time can access the internet, which is a nuisance if there is more than one person in your group and they both want to use their laptops at the same time. Holiday Inn should update to wireless internet. I don\u2019t know anyone anymore who actually uses a laptop at a desk. I want to prop it up on my lap and compute in bed. There was an electrical outlet on the side of one of our two beds to plug in a laptop cord; the person in the other bed was out of luck. I\u2019m not a fan of window-based HVAC units because temperature is hard to regulate and they inevitably make me too hot or too cold. The Holiday Inn\u2019s unit was no exception to this rule. It was noisy, too. I appreciated the little red light in the bathroom, so I could find my way there if need be in the middle of the night. It was helpful without being so bright that it intruded on my sleep. My over-50 eyes appreciated the fact that the shampoo bottles actually said \u2018SHAMPOO\u2019 in big black letters on a light background (I\u2019ve encountered some hotels where it says something other than \u201cshampoo\u201d and it\u2019s in small white letters on a light-colored bottle), so I appreciate not having to pull out my reading glasses to figure out which bottle to use. The Holiday Inn provides coupons good for up to $20 worth of breakfast at their restaurant on the second floor. I was easily able to feed one person for far less than the $20. Plus, breakfast hours were not limited to the early-morning hours as they usually are when a motel provides a free breakfast buffet. This met the approval of my late-rising teen. There is a ticket office and small gift shop tucked in the corner of the front lobby. They can provide tickets for a variety of events occurring throughout the Los Angeles area. Surprisingly, they had no knowledge of the movie schedule for the cinema across the street. The Hilton has made a commendable effort at security by requiring the use of your room\u2019s key card to access the upper floors of the building by elevator. You slide your card in a slot in the elevator, and then it allows you to access your floor. And just YOUR floor. Experimentally, I tried entering floor numbers both higher and lower than my own. It wouldn\u2019t let me do it. I realize that a second person could rush in behind the legitimate guest and exit on the same floor as the guest, but the Holiday Inn\u2019s limited elevator access is more than the vast majority of hotels do to restrict access to the guest rooms. Since I own a home in Eureka (where there was recently a 6.5-magnitude earthquake), I couldn\u2019t help wondering about the seismic safety of this 10-story hotel in the heart of Los Angeles. I asked at the front desk if the Holiday Inn had been retrofitted to meet modern earthquake seismic safety standards. The front desk clerks didn\u2019t know.

It is EXTREMELY convenient from both of those and no need for a taxi or shuttle. They are within a one to two block walk. The rooms are large, the beds are moderately comfy. The carpet could use some replacing. It is showing signs of wear. The bathrooms are big with a good shower. (My sink drain stopper didn't work but that was no big deal). There is a small rooftop pool over the 2nd floor. It is a small outdoor pool so not really useful for anything other than small kids. It has a fairly good restaurant with booths that have individual TVs at each booth for solo travellers to stay entertained while waiting for your food. It is very convenient to the LA Metro trains. From LAX don't bother with a $60 cab ride. You can take the Metro Green Line to the Blue Line for $1.25 each way. Just catch the connector bus to the train station and grab the Metro. Or for only $4 one way, you can take the LA Flyaway Bus to Union Station and take the Red LIne to the 7th Street transit station and walk three blocks to get there. Overall, I was skeptical at first but once I got there I found it was a very good deal for a good location and very convenient to certain downtown LA spots. One quick note: there is a major expansion of the convention center complex happening right across the street and some of the activity happens early in the morning with construction trucks making lots of noise.

You're right downtown, just walking distance from the Fashion District and what not. Sure, there is construction going on, and some sidewalks are closed, but that was no big deal for us as we are from NYC. Clean rooms, cute decorating. Free internet, spacious rooms. I felt very safe in the hotel; security was top notch. The Bad: We were a little confused on how to get here. The street starts out as a two way street, then changes to one way right in front of the hotel, so that threw us for a loop (or two) a few times. There is a new building being constructed across the street, but the view should be better once it's complete. Staples Center is near, which can be good if you're attending something there, but we did not realize that a championship game between the Lakers and Spurs was going on the first night of our stay, so it was kind of packed in the lobby and bar, but we probably should have researched that. The Ugly: Paper thin walls. So, at just after midnight, there are kids screaming and running up and down the halls. The headboard of the bed next door (or maybe it was from upstairs) banged against our wall for about ten minutes. The customer service is terrible. We've called the front desk several times and rarely get an answer. Going to a Dodgers game, we asked the attendant to hail us a cab. What pulled up was a REALLY nice luxury sedan. The attendant said this to us: \"Oh, here is our hotel's courtesy taxi. Enjoy your game!\" Now, there were three of us, and we all heard that. So, we get dropped off at the farthest place possible at the stadium, and as we get out of the car, the driver tells us that its a $30 charge. So much for a courtesy taxi. Game was awesome, we call back to the hotel just shy of 9pm, asking for their \"courtesy\" taxi to come pick us up. She tells us that they have no courtesy taxis, just a taxi company they have a contract with and \"every employee here KNOWS that.\" Then she says that all of the drivers have gone home for the day, so we should just call another taxi company. Then click. Didn't offer to call a company for us, much less give us the numbers to one. So its raining outside, and we found a cab parked MUCH closer to the stadium, and it was only $11 from the stadium to the hotel. This was even after we were stuck in traffic for a while.

And either we lucked out and there was no one staying on either side of us for two nights or the room was particularly well built because we never heard other people's noise. We had drinks at the bar one night, and breakfast one morning. The food was fine, and service was friendly. My biggest complaint is that there were TVs plastered all over both spaces--acceptable, I guess, for a bar near the Staples Center, but definitely overkill in the dining area.

We were given no advance notice by the hotel, and when we attempted to return to the hotel later that morning, we were forced to pay to park in a lot three blocks away. The front desk staff refunded the hotel's parking fee for the nite ($15), but offered no apology for the inconvenience. The breakfast is overpriced and the exercise room is small. Do yourself a favor and find a holiday inn express nearby. You may think you're saving time by staying close to USC and Staples Center here, but you're really just asking for frustration.", "Date": "September 14, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "S.F.

Friendly and helpful gentelman at the door and very professional and friendly employees when I checked in, to the nice lady who cleaned the room. I have stayed in different hotels from California to New york and overseas. It is sad to see how employees can be rude and cold when you check in. Not at the Holiday Inn City Center downtown Los Angeles. This was not only my experience. I also noticed how well they treated others while waiting.

(Yes, a Holiday Inn believe it or not!) This hotel is outfited with nice hardwood crown moldings and chair rail. It has a well priced restaurnant and a menu that you would never expect at a Holiday Inn. I have heard they hired a chef from a five star hotel to re-create the restaurant and bar. The rooms are the biggest rooms in LA, with granite bathrooms, everything was very nice and new. The staff is very helpful and friendly.This is an amazing experience if you need to go to Downtown LA and don't want to spend $170 a night you will get a nicer room, better food, great service and a steal at around $109 a night.", "Date": "May 21, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Luxe City Center Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g32655-d77787-Reviews-Luxe_City_Center_Hotel-Los_Angeles_California.html", "Price": "$204 - $335*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1020 South Figueroa Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Los Angeles</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">90015</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "2516034", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8f/81/2e/deluxe-king.jpg"}}
