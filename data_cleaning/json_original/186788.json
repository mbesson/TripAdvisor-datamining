Good housekeeping & a shuttle is available to go anywhere in downtown. Our kids loves playing table tennis when my wife & I could relax in the whirlpool. Tea & coffee are available all day. Staff are always helpful & friendly. Thank you so much Susan at the reception for providing us a room on the higher floor & for organising our family first ski lessons at Grouse Mountain. We had so much fun at Grouse (they open till 10pm!!!) that we spent 3 full days skiing there. My wife had a cut on her hand & Chris at the reception gave her band-aid & disinfectant spray.

The complimentary shuttle and bikes with the breakfast each morning really made it super great deal for us. One night after a long day\u2019s work/adventure, we just went to the Jacuzzi and soaked our feet. The sauna was great as well!! Our room was quiet and clean with a view of the neon-lit BC Stadium. Breakfast included eggs and sausage daily with scones, oatmeals, cereals, fruit, juices \u2013 everything we needed. The waffles we made each day were our very favorite. About two blocks up the street from the hotel, 489 Robson, there was a grocery store, MarketPlace, which enabled us to stock our room refrigerator. The bicycle rental enabled trips through Stanley Park, to Granville Island, Chinatown, and Gastown. The staff was very friendly and provided great solutions to any challenge we had for them. The location was good as well. Though we were traveling to the convention center each day, the shuttle made it very convenient and we could either walk back to the hotel (which was a pleasant, 20 minute walk or so) or take the train (4 minute journey). Upon our arrival was the most pleasant orange and strawberry water. We purchased the 10 ticket books for the train from the airport (7 eleven domestic terminal), so it made taking the train very easy. The shuttle and bikes must be reserved each day. The hotel was also very safe. Hotel room keys operated the elevators and the surrounding areas outside of the hotel seemed clean and safe, no matter how late. We arrived to the hotel at dark and left in the early morning hours. They also provided bottled a water. Another bonus.

As I had to self fund the weekend in between business stays, I stayed at the Hampton Inn, partly because it was cheap, partly because I wanted the Hilton points, and partly because it was convenient for the NHL at Rogers Arena. Despite an early arrival, I was able to check in straight away, and I was given a suite. It was, quite honestly, the best room I have ever had in a Hampton Inn. It was larger than my apartment, with a sizeable kitchen, a large living room, and a large bedroom. The bathroom was standard size. It was spotless - I could not find anything to complain about at all in terms of cleanliness. The towels were large and soft, and the amenities, whilst being the standard Hampton amenities, were plentiful. The kitchen area was equipped with a dual hob, dishwasher, fridge, microwave, and various electricals. There was also a coffee maker, as expected in any room, with a plentiful supply of sugar and coffee. The living room and bed room both had large flat screen televisions. The view was nothing to write home about, being as it was of the construction site next door, but this did not affect me at all. WiFi was free and I was able to connect multiple devices - iPad, iPhone and work laptop with no issue. Location was good - a little further from the airprot Skytrain than I expected, but still only 5 or 6 blocks. I had tickets for the Canucks hockey, and Roger's arena is only about 3 blocks away...very convenient. I could mark the hotel down on the breakfast - but with Hampton's in North America, you know what it is going to be - it was not exotic, but certainly adequate. The biggest downsize to the breakfast was the horde of screaming toddlers on morning 1, who seems to regard the buffet island as an obstacle to run around, and the fact that on morning 2, I seemed to be the only person at breakfast NOT wearning pyjamas (I was in normal day clothes I hasten to add!).

The rooms are large and efficiently if not exactly elegantly decorated. Bottles of water and coffee / tea are complementary.

Everything was clean and functional, lots of TV channels on flat screens, and nice views. Although this can be a very busy area of town, it is quiet inside the building. Improvements: Already mentioned the towels and while you get a lot of complementary ammenities, it is not an inexpensive place to stay, including nearly 16% taxes and fees ( what the heck is a destination marketing fee and why am I paying it?).

The hotel is about 10mins away from Granville area and right across the road from BC Place and the Rogers Arena - an excellent choice if you plan on seeing an event. We booked a double queen which was quite spacious and included a large bathroom and separate wardrobe (?) containing a kitchenette. This was a nice touch although we only used the fridge and ate out most of the time. The view from our room (9th floor) was awesome and you could see right into the BC Place stadium which is currently having some work done to add a retractable roof. We stayed over a weekend and the noise from the workmen was only noticeable on the Monday Morning. Being at the end of Beatty Street it was quite out of the distance but it meant that street noise was at a bare minimum and we always got a good night\u2019s sleep.

Maid Service didn\u2019t arrive too early in the morning which is a positive for the night owls and each morning they provide complimentary papers and bottles of water in addition to new towels. It is satisfying to receive double-towels for that night time shower given that most hotels are now restricting their linen arrangement. The decor was welcoming (although I wasn\u2019t that bothered) and the beds were super comfortable - exactly what I needed after many days of walking the city. When turning the A/C off I couldn't help but notice an odour in the room. I can't remember if I had specifically asked for a non-smoking room but there was definitely that type of smell in the air. Breakfast was the usual buffet arrangement with scrambled eggs and waffles provided most mornings in addition to a meat item and the common cereal and juice/tea.

We stayed at the Hampton Inn during this time. While it is not exactly in the heart of downtown Vancouver, it's so close that it was worth it for the reduced cost/night plus free breakfast. The hotel staff was very accommodating and friendly, and there was even an on-site shuttle that took us to the local downtown sites we wanted to see. All we had to do was tip the driver, which isn't a necessity, but he was super nice too so we wanted to say thanks. The hotel room - we stayed on the 7th floor - didn't have wonderful views but we were able to see all the sites in our own travels so we didn't care to have a great view from our room. In our eyes, if you're spending too much time in the room, you're not enjoying the wonderful scenery outdoors enough! Anyway, the room was clean, and had a mini fridge and microwave, which was helpful when we had leftovers. This hotel is in a quieter part of the city, which was nice at night when we actually did want to go to sleep. Here are some things we did while staying in the city that you may want to try: -Yaletown - we found this area to be the most suited to our tastes (older 20-somethings to younger to mid 30-somethings). Upscale restaurants, great bars, good scenery and people watching. We ate lunch at Milestones in Yaletown, which was great. I know they have a deal for every day of the week. I think Wed was date night where all bottles of wine are $5 off. We also ate at Earl's (great patio with heat lamps and blankets if you want one!), Yaletown Pub & Brewery, and another tapas/sushi place whose name escapes me. Definitely check out the rooftop patio at The Keg - we loved this place. The drinks aren't cheap but they didn't seem to be cheap anywhere. The staff was incredibly friendly (and good looking!!), and the views from the roof were fantastic. -Yuk Yuk's Comedy Club - went on a Saturday night. This is located at a hotel downtown (again, I forget the name but you can probably look it up). I found it very funny and enjoyed the \"different' humor. We're from the States so the jokes some of the comedians cracked about Canada and Vancouver sometimes went over our heads, but for the most part it was very entertaining. Make a reservation in advance if you want to visit. -Granville Island - we went kayaking through EcoMarine for 2.5 hours (creek tour). Fun time - not cheap. Also, take note that if you make a reservation in advance, if you need to change days (we did due to rain on the initial day we booked), they charge you $10 if you're 48 hours from your original booking. Seemed silly but we paid it and enjoyed it. The shops are cute to visit - we didn't eat at the market since it was so crowded to walk through. Instead we went to Go Fish, this little stand that was recommended by our kayak instructor. The BEST fish and chips we had out there. We also tried the tomato soup and the sesame crusted tuna sandwich. The line for this place was super long, as I've heard it always is, and the wait to get your food after you order takes about 15-20 mins, but it was delicious and not all that expensive! Highly recommended. -Stanley Park - we rented bicycles and rode the seawall. I don't ride often so I was a bit nervous, but it was easy riding and gorgeous scenery. The food at the park was very expensive so we didn't eat there but I heard people packing picnics. Try that! Also, if you rent a bike, make sure to shop around. We found a place that was cheaper than some others, but didn't offer flat tire service in case you get a flat while you're out in the park. We took the risk and everything was fine so we ended up saving some money. -Granville Street - many bars and clubs on this street that are hot on Friday/Saturdays, but we're not much into the clubbing scene so we decided to walk around the street to check out what goes on there. Since the drinking age is a bit younger in Canada than home for us, there seemed to be many younger people (18-early 20's) totally wasted wandering the streets. In just the 2 blocks we walked, we witnessed a girl almost puke, two guys being broken up from getting into a fight, people drinking in the streets, and girls with dresses so short and tight that I was amazed they could breathe. Interesting to walk through, but Yaletown felt less wild and crazy to us. Totally a personal preference and I'm sure the club scene is a lot of fun, but it was definitely wild :-) Was fun to check out though! Aside from that, we spent a lot of time at the English Bay beach and some of the parks in the area. I highly recommend laying on a blanket and just relaxing out there, or bringing picnic food and staying to watch the sunset.

Our room was very quiet and overlooked BC stadium. Yes, the breakfast room is on the small side but they do their best to accomodate everyone as best they can. The food was very typical of the Hampton chain. Vancouver in general seems to have a problem with homeless and pan handling - read other posts about this and pay attention to your surroundings. We had no problems around the hotel, mainly Chinatown and Gastown. We did have the fire alarm go off at 3:30 AM and had to walk down from the 11th floor! We heard someone was smoking in a non-smoking room and set off the alarm. All was handled well, just a delay in unlocking the elevators (my husband has walking issues and had to wait for the elevators).

They steered us towards southwest of the hotel (Hamilton street) where there were lots of trendy shops and eateries where the hamburgers start at $15 USD. Was not interested and considering their eateries were mainly empty not many others were at that time either. Robson street was the answer. There were several \"cheaper eats\" along the road including the Japadog restaurant which I now regret missing out on. When we got back the internet still was not working for me, but we were able to get the wired connection up after calling their tech support. I was worried that the evening was going to be a loud one since there was a heavy metal concert going on nearby. We did hear lots of people shouting before the concert, but didn't hear anything in the evening. Must have been dead tired. The breakfast in the morning was one of the best set up I had ever seen at a Hampton. The second floor of the lobby area was all for breakfast and the selections were plentiful.

The room itself was wonderful: nicely decorated with clean, white bedspreads and down pillows. Flat screen TV, beautiful bathroom, not bad water pressure. The best part of the room, however, was that two whole walls were glass windows, floor to ceiling, looking over BC Place (we were on the 10th floor). What a view!

There is free breakfast from 6 to 10am, although we got up too late our first morning, we did see it our second morning before leaving for the airport. They had coffee, tea, pastries, cereal (all sugar ones), and some hot items (not sure what they were). The top floor has a recreation room with a couple of treadmills, some weights, a ping-pong table, a foosball table, and a huge hot tub. The hot tub wasn't very hot, but warm enough to feel like you were sitting in a bath. The jets weren't very powerful at all either. There was also a balcony area to look out over Vancouver. The location was ok. We were within 15 minute walking distance to the marina in Yaletown and also Chinatown and Gastown. The area of the hotel was pretty safe, it's the areas in between Chinatown and Gastown that can get a little sketchy. The hotel is located along Robson St which is a good shopping street. We've stayed at a lot of Hilton hotels, but I just didn't really feel the hospitality, coziness, or charm here that we normally feel when staying at a Hilton.

We could have stayed on a higher floor had we waited a few hours but since the floor plan was the same, we opted for the best available at that time. Staff went above and beyond-always friendly, smiling, and professional (see comment about safe below). The hotel was directly across the street from BC Place, where the BC Lions CFL team plays, and we were on the side facing it. General Motors Place, where the NHL Vancouver Canucks play, is about 100 metres away. Both teams had home games the night we were there, and there were lots of boisterous fans. There was pre game music and other celebratory noise during and just after the games until about 11 pm, but can\u2019t fault hotel. The fans were well behaved but just loud. If this is an issue, check the game schedules, and stay across town somewhere. The room had 2 very comfortable beds with duvets, 3 large pillows, and 1 small pillow. I got a great night\u2019s sleep. Also, 2 telephones, internet connection in room for dialup but wifi also-didn\u2019t have computer so not sure how well it works (there are two free internet stations on 2nd floor near breakfast room-just ask for 30 minute passwords at front desk), a television with about 50 channels-US and Canadian but no ESPN or ESPN2 so limited US sports, especially NCAA. There was a free in room safe-it didn\u2019t work so I called front desk and someone came in less than 5 minutes to reprogram. There was a refrigerator and microwave but no minibar to rip you off. (there is a convenience store-7/11 I think, just down Robson for drinks and snacks) There was a kettle for coffee and tea and ample supplies-sure they would give more supplies, if requested-2 complimentary bottles of water also! There was a desk, table with 2 chairs, ample lighting, and clock radio. There was a closet with plenty of space and several hangers. The top floor of the hotel has an area with table tennis, 4 exercise machines, pool, dry sauna, hot tub as well as bathrooms and water station-not sure if there is shower in the bathrooms since I didn\u2019t go in there. Terrace for sun bathing or touristy views of city-area very clean and well maintained-no litter or anything negative except smoker on terrace. Realize hotel can\u2019t be everywhere all the time, but warning signs may help. $200 fine for smoking in room, but does that include the terrace or standing in room with head out window-2 windows that opened from room-can see cigarette butts on roof just below room-I wondered if people smoke in room next to window or with their head out window and then use the rooftop for their ashtray. If the hotel is totally smoke free, that should mean \u201ctotally\u201d, everywhere!!! (hotel should investigate) Parking area very secure-2 gates to pass through with room key before reaching parking spots. You don\u2019t need key to get out as one previous reviewer mentioned. Parking price reasonable for downtown Vancouver where even meters aren\u2019t free on Sundays and holidays. Elevators require card swipe everytime-even from guest room floors. Felt very safe and secure. Ice machine out of order on my floor but no big issue-hotel had sign and was repairing. I had to go up a few floor for ice. Typical Hampton Inn breakfast-ham patties and fried egg circles the morning we were there plus coffee, tea, juice, breads, cereals, etc. as well-everyday standards at Hampton Inns. I would have preferred sausage patties but no big deal-I just picked the wrong morning for those. If you are meat lover and want a fantastic lunch-head for Samba Brazilian Steakhouse & Churrascaria at 1122 Alberni St (between Robson and Georgia just past Burrard). It\u2019s about a kilometer from the hotel. All you can eat lunch with buffet and servers walking around with different meat skewers for CDN$14, I believe. Lamb is especially good. It\u2019s currently in the Delta Dining guide so I even earned some SkyMiles! I have no complaints except for the lone smoker or two who breaks the rules. This was a great find for a very reasonable price in the centre of a fantastic city.

We enjoyed the stay a great deal. The hotel was in excellent shape, despite the fact that it looks to be around 20 years old. Our accommodation was a large, one-bedroom king suite on the 14th floor. It was light, bright and very spacious. The outlook, North-West along Robson Street, wasn\u2019t anything to write home about, but we weren\u2019t there particularly for the view. Everything in the suite was spotless, from the kitchen (equipped with a microwave oven, a dishwasher and a refrigerator, but no stove) through the bedroom and living room to the spacious bathroom. The suite was equipped with two large television sets, and there was adequate lighting for activities during the evenings. The king bed was excellent. There was an adequate supply of high-quality towels and toiletries in the bathroom. The kitchen was fully equipped with cutlery, crockery, microwave cooking dishes and a variety of other implements. Perfect if (like us) you wanted to do a bit of cooking \u201cat home\u201d after a long time on the road. The breakfast (included in the room rate) was OK \u2013 standard for the lower-cost establishments in the Hilton range. The high-point for us was that (unlike others at this end of the market) there was real (steel) cutlery and china plates, not plastic. There was an average cold buffet of cereals, juices, fruits and breads, plus the usual \u201cegg-like\u201d and \u201csausage-like\u201d hot material. We ate at Zachary\u2019s restaurant, in the lower lobby, once while we were there and found it to be quite agreeable. The reception staff were friendly and very helpful. There was adequate free Internet access that was rationed to half an hour/ticket (available from reception), though no-one seemed to mind if you took more than one ticket. The location of the hotel was good for us \u2013a 20 minute walk to the harbour-front, Gas Town and China Town, and less than ten minutes to the restaurant strip in Yaletown and the Robson/Burrard shopping area. There's a skytrain station about 5 minutes walk away. There was a selection of decent takeaway joints on Robson within two blocks of the hotel, and a few bars within the same distance. There\u2019s an excellent IGA Marketplace just three blocks away, and here you can buy almost every (food) thing your heart may desire. And if you can\u2019t suppress the shopping urge, there are Sears and Hudson Bay shopatoriums within three blocks. The hotel runs a free shuttle that will take you most anywhere in downtown (the rule, apparently, is that it will not cross any bridge), including Stanley Park, West Vancouver and so on. For the downside \u2013 just one thing. We HATED and REJECT the Destination Marketing Fee (DMF) of 1.5% that\u2019s added to the bill. Provincial sales tax and federal Goods and Services Tax are added to the DMF, so it ends up being significantly more than 1.5%. This bit of lunacy, according to the maniacs at the Vancouver Hotel Destination Association who designed it, is intended to pay for marketing the Vancouver hotels (you can see their laughable rationale at http://www.vanhda.ca/ ). We were at a loss to see why the hotels would expect us to pay for their marketing \u2013 one usually expects to see business overheads reflected in the room rate. Paying the DMF is not an option (as it is in Canadian Niagara Falls). You\u2019re stuck with it. We will not stay in downtown Vancouver again while this \u201cprivate tax\u201d exists (we stayed there 3 times during our latest trip and didn\u2019t think to ask what the DMF was until our final day). We\u2019ll be in Canada again in May, but we will NOT stay in downtown Vancouver.

Based on all the reviews I read here in making my decision to stay here, I realize there is little that I can add that has not already been mentioned about this location, so I will address just a few things that seem to keep coming up: Service: The front desk staff during out stay and the reservation staff I spoke with pre-stay were beyond helpful. These were some of the nicest people I have ever dealt with relating to a hotel stay. Everyone went above and beyond to give us information. Breakfast: It is not gourmet, but it is extremely generous considering it is free for ALL guests every day of the week. Most hotels that offer breakfast, even for their best customers, do not offer hot items. This, plus the standard pastries and all-day fresh coffee is a huge money saver. Location: This is a big city folks. There will be homeless people. Walk up a few blocks to the coveted \"heart of it all\" on Robson. There are homeless people there too. There is nothing unsafe about the location of the Hampton Inn. You are within walking distance to Yaletown, Chinatown, the main shopping district on Robson, GM Place and BC Place. We even walked up to the entrance of Stanley Park in less than 30 minutes. There is nothing unsafe about the area; it is just busy. Shuttle Service: Not only may you use the shuttle to get to the cruise pier (no return service) but, if available, the shuttle will take you whereever you want to go Downtown...FOR FREE.

Location wise is not as centrally located as the Blue Horizon which was what I originally planned. Chose Hampton Inn instead because I am a long time HH Honor member and has plenty of points to get free nights except for a weekend night which the points cant be used. Anyway it cost $230 CAD for the entire stay. As for not as centrally located which really is not a problem for us. We've been to Vancouver multiple times and always look at downtown Vancouver like a San Francisco (walking town for us). We can walk from the east end to the west end (to the outskirt of Stanley Park) in half an hour - 45 minutes. Of course not counting time spent going in and out of all the wonderful shops on Robson. We've also walked to Yaletown by the False Creek in 15 minutes, same with going a little north to cover both Chinatown and Gastown. There is bicycle on loan that we took advantage of for 3 hours at a stretch. Recommendation is to get up early (to avoid crowds for both bicycle loan and breakfast bar, or free internet for that matter). We got up around 6:30am, no one at all at the second floor breakfast (which compared to the many other Hamptons that I've stayed in) that has much more extensive menu. Juice, milk, coffee, yogurt, all sorts of breads, pastries, croissant, fresh fruits as well as some eggs and meats. At 8am the doorman came and we checked out the bicycle/helmet and off we go. 3 hours are plenty of time to bike along the entire downtown shoreline including a visit inside the Stanley Park. Getting to Granville Island is convenient on the Aqua Bus. The pier is only about 10 minutes walk behind the BC Stadium. We stayed on the 12 floor, nice size corner room. There were construction around us (2010 Olympics has something to do with the boom in Vancouver) but no noise. Beds were comfortable. Room has the usual Hampton Inn amenities which included microwave, fridge, hairdryer, internet connection. This is not the usual Hampton Inn which stands 16 stories high (top floor is gym/spa/pool) which on the upside gives a great view at the roof top level on BC Place and part of the city. The downside is having only 2 elevators for the entire building make certain time of the day extremely slow service (avoid the usual check in/check out time, the lobby is not big). Staff however are always pleasant and remember your name from start to finish. Courteous and professional and offer help when needed.

Well ... my feelings changed the next morning. The breakfast was very good, considering it was free. Very few hot items, but a sausage patty and muffin later and I had a nice breakfast sandwich! It was a good assortment. The front desk clerks are VERY helpful and friendly. They were more than willing to help us plan our day, even printing information about bike rentals, complete with prices so we didn't have to make those phone calls!

We noticed the most amount of homeless/beggars around Chinatown, Gastown and the shops on Robson. The room was very nice, and the hot tub on the 15th floor was enjoyable at night (esp. after so much walking!) Complimentary water, small frig and microwave made bringing back leftovers easy and stress-free so we could continue to enjoy the awesome food we had.

I've been to Vancouver many times and think is and is not the case. If you're from a larger metro area, you'll likely think nothing of it. But, Vancouver is a port city and has some of those port city issues. One is an active drug trade and a lot of homeless drug abusers flock to the city (Canada has pretty limited enforcement). My wife and I were approached by a several homeless drug addicts during this last trip, one within 200 feet of the hotel door. But, the other was within a similar distance to the Four Seasons and the Fairmont so you'll likely get that kind of thing.

We used the hot tub (up on the top floor with a deck outside so you can enjoy the view) and the sauna (same location). Both were great; clean, comfortable, and largely ignored by other guests. They serve a free breakfast one flight up and connected to the lobby. Plenty of food: eggs, bacon, sausage, waffles, biscuits, bagels, pastries, fruits. Can be crowded though. All in all, a great addition to the stay. We didn't drive, so can't speak to parking. Its close enough to walk to many downtown locations, and relatively easy to catch a cab. Its not a full service hotel, so there wasn't a real taxi stand, but exiting from the lobby in to the drive we always found a cab there (although I think we waited about 2 minutes once. Room: We had a king non-smoking room. When we arrived, we needed to change our reservation but that was not an issue. The front desk clerk (1 of 2 on duty at the time) was considerate, knew his stuff, and made the change without issue. The room looked out on BC Place. Our second night there the hometeam CFL BC Lions won a game and the cheering spilled out on to the street for about 10 minutes shortly after 11PM. Not loud in the room though, and we thought it was cute that the CFL crowd was so quiet and went home so quickly (not like an NFL game to be sure!). The room had a small sofa, a desk and chair, and the bed. All nicely arranged and in good shape. The room was cleaned daily; adequate towels and supplies left. No complaints. All in all, a very good stay. I go to Vancouver often, and prefer to be near the water. If this isn't a must, or if you can't get a room waterfront in the summer, this is a great choice.", "Date": "November 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tuusula, Finland", "Title": "\u201cNice Place\u201d", "Author": "dadsasdasd", "ReviewID": "UR10114667", "Content": "Location could have perhaps been a bit more central for a hotel called \u201cdowntown\u201d, but still only 10 min walk to the actual downtown, so no major complaints.

Breakfast: It's great that this is complimentary and although the breakfast room was busy we always managed to find a table.

The rooms are spacious and come with everything you could possibly need (including enough pillows for about 8 people). Wireless internet is included with each room. The room service is reasonably priced, has a good selection and arrives promptly. The breakfast is a very high-end continental. Lots of choices from cereals to pastries to fruits to yogurts to waffles...on and on. You can also get a 'breakfast to go' bag if you're in a hurry in the morning with some fruit, a muffin and a bottle of water. Great idea.

I stayed for two nights as partof a business trip to Vancouver. Arrival and check-in took perhaps two minutes; the desk agent was friendly and made sure I had my internet access code and a quick run down of the hotel's major services and ammenities. Guests must use their room keys to operate the elevators, a nice security feature. My room was a two-room setup, with a living/room kitchen area with electric range, microwave, and full-size fridge. The living room area has a queen-size sofa bed, a large TV with remote, and a cordless phone. The bedroom had a king-bed with an assortment of pillows (soft/hard), another TV with remote, and a small but adequate work desk with phone and high-speed internet connection (internet is free). The suite was spotless; bedding was crisp and clean. The bathroom was large and well stocked with linens. The bedroom and living room each featured their own HVAC controls, while the bedroom/bath area also featured a control that allows you to control the humidity in the room. I generally do not sleep well in hotels, but at this Hampton I enjoyed a restful, quiet, and altogether enjoyable sleep both nights. The complimentary breakfast is served in a small area that overlooks the small main lobby area. A nice selection of cold and hot items was available. The service and eating areas were extremely clean and well-serviced. All of hotel staff members I met during my stay were friendly and eager to answer questions or offer personal help. An additional complementary service offered by the hotel in the morning is its shuttle service. I used the shuttle to travel from the hotel to the downgtown location where I had meetings scheduled.

At C$322 for two nights including tax I can't argue with the price, either.

The food itself is good and the coffee is excellent - but I was horrified to find polystyrene plates, plastic cutlery and paper cups. This is just not good enough, and sours an otherwise good service. It would be unacceptable in a cheap motel, let alone in a big downtown hotel.

Our room was a Deluxe King Jacuzzi room located on a corner with full windows looking out over BC Place and the Cambie St Bridge. It was a very nice room, with an extremely comfy bed and nice fittings. The jacuzzi was fantastic and a great size for two. We payed for a Romance package (C$199) for one night, which included a box of chocolates, some non-alcoholic sparkling cider, a $30 voucher for dinner in the hotel's restaurant, and most importantly a 2pm check-out. At a premium over the standard room rate of $159, the package may not be worth the extra cost. With so many amazing restaurants nearby in Yaletown, the hotel restaurant is an unappealing option and we didn't use the voucher (although it might be able to be used for breakfast?). The chocolates were tasty, but the 2pm checkout was excellent and almost made the package deal worthwhile on its own.

It's true the hotel is not immediately surrounded by lots of pretty buildings, but it was hard to beat the view once you got up to your room. I booked a Jacuzzi suite which was clean and beautiful. We had a corner room, so we had views of two directions as both outside walls were nothing but windows.

The staff was wonderful; polite, helpful and totally welcoming which surprised me, considering the hour. When we got up to our room, we saw the lights had been left on for us. It was a nice touch. The room itself was honestly the cleanest hotel room we've ever been in. This is extremely high praise, since I'm notoriously picky about cleanliness. (You could say I'm anal-retentive but I prefer to say I have high standards.) Even the toiletries in the bathroom and the condiments by the coffee maker were laid out in perfectly neat rows. I thought I'd died and gone to neat-freak heaven. The bed was wonderful, with a fluffy down comforter, soft cotton sheets and a mattress so nice, my husband woke up the next morning without the backache he usually gets when we travel. In the morning, we used the workout room on the top floor of the hotel. Again, it was perfectly clean and boasted a fabulous view of the city. After running on the treadmills, we stretched out on the large, wrap-around deck area. With the beautiful view and the cool breeze, it was the perfect way to end our run. On our way out of the workout room, we noticed a large basket full of fresh apples (we each grabbed one and they were delicious) and stacks of cups next to the water fountain. For me, that kind of thoughtfulness and attention to detail sums up the Hampton. We normally would never stay in anything below a four star hotel.

It had everything you could want (within reason of course), was very clean and tidy. I think the location was pretty convenient as well. I wish we had more time in the beautiful city of Vancouver and in the comforts of the Hampton Inn because we loved every minute of our stay.

Price: We paid only $119 a night for a room with a jacuzzi, a king size bed, ceiling to floor windows with an amazing view of the city, complimentary breakfast - (scrambled eggs, cinnamon buns, muffins, toast, english muffins, coffee, tea, cereal, fresh fruit, yogurt, danishes, juice, etc.) The room even had a complimentary umbrella for us to use - and we definitely used it. A nice touch! 2. Location: Contrary to what some of the reviews said, the location was great! We were within walking distance to the sky train, great shops, etc. It was on the quieter end of Robson but not that far away...(however, we do love to walk.) It felt safe in our area - there were many panhandlers and homeless people downtown but we did not see any within a few blocks of our hotel. They were mostly on the busier area of Robson and definitely on Granville! 3. Amenities: On the 16th floor was the excercise room, hot tub, ping pong table, foosball table, sauna, balcony with a great view, couches, etc. It was opened until midnight every night. We even entertained some friends there for an hour or two while we were waiting to go out for the evening! Too bad there wasn't a pool! 4. Service: Excellent service right from calling them over the phone to book our stay...to our last day there. Every employee we met were smiling and friendly! My husband and I ran into a small problem on our last day; we ended up shopping a little too much and did not have any room in our luggage to carry the extra goodies. The front desk staff helped out and found us a box that fit perfectly and gave us packing tape to seal it! Plus, we got these chocolates that were crazy good on our last night! (They ended up giving us an extra box of chocolates at the front desk - just because!) There were only 2 problems that we had during our stay at the Hampton and they were minor problems: 1. the tv was kind of wonky - colour was changing from being too red to kinda green, and was also a little fuzzy at times while watching shows and movies. 2. the shower leaked and we had to use all our towels to sop up the water on the floor!
