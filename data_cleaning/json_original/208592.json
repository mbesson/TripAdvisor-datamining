Great hotel, certainly puts many 5 star hotels to shame. Had the best dining experience we've had in a long time at the hotel restaurant (Fonda), service was impeccable and the meal was amazing. Great location, room was large and modern without fault. Bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was large and well equipped (shower is amazing). 20 mins to the airport, walking distance to most tourist spots in old Barcelona and the hop on hop off bus tours (which could then take you further afield). Free wifi would be nice, we stayed in a hostel for a couple of nights and at $40 p/night they managed to provide free internet. This seems to be rare for hotels these days though, so not a major problem. There is a fair bit of activity on the back streets around the hotel at night, so could be a good idea to bring earplugs if you sleep lightly.

The Hotel was booked by my Sister-in-Law,(Thanks Rose) and it turned out a very good experience.most all the people that i told that we were going to Barcelona said to be very careful because of muggings and pickpockets,we did not see any theft through out our stay,i even commented to friends that there are more Police sirens back home than here.I even ventured out fairly early for a stroll(7.45am) and did not feel anyway threatened,its also the best time to see things(hardly anybody about). The Hotel is ideally situated for walking as its only about a 100yds from the Ramblas and a short walk gets you to the Harbour area,where you can get some food and people watch.Food is a bit on the expensive side but as all Big Cities charge more you just have to accept it.The Hotel room we were in was on the front of the Hotel directly over the entrance overlooking the street,to me it was ok i like to hear whats going on but one of the other members of our party was a bit upset at being woken in the night to shouting and singing,but you are in a City and i only heard any noise once when needing the toilet,but got to sleep straight away.The room was very quiet no creaking floors or heating/water noises,in fact the room was very warm to warm for me but the Wife likes hot so i have to sweat,you can dial in the temp you want on the control panel by the door,just a comment about the heating,all the power to lights etc is controlled by placing the credit card that opens the door into a slot and then all the light etc work,when you go out the room and take the card out,when you come back in and replace the card the heating sets to a default eg 22c,i found out when trying to get to sleep i was way to hot,just need to dial in lower setting,the room was great,clean and functional,shower was brilliant the biggest i have been in.We did not try the breakfast meal so cannot comment,but the bar was good, average price and you could watch television or talk.The staff as has been said before are friendly and helpful even opening the Hotel door at times,also must add on that the Rituals bathroom soaps and shower items are really good have even looked up our local supplier to get top up supplies.We will be visiting Barcelona again but later in the year as April can be cool and we will be booking this Hotel.When reviewing any holiday you tend to pick up on the low points and everybody will have them whether its the airport/the place/hotel/ so its a balance, you hear horror stories all the time but mostly its only minor niggles and as this one stands out as one of the good ones,as a footnote it amazed me on walking about i noticed that they have a cycling hire system called Bicing which as i later found out you subscribe to and i think it was 20 euro`s per year and it gives you access to these cycles that are placed all over the city which you can pick up and drop off in designated locations all over the city and best of all i did not see any vandalised ,they tried this in the UK but all the bikes were nicked.All in all a very good Hotel and City to visit we will be back.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Europe", "Title": "\u201cThe Charm of Espanya...\u201d", "Author": "Nikki L", "ReviewID": "UR127906474", "Content": "The Hotel is conveniently located near Las Ramblas where one can walk to almost anywhere in Barcelona. I strongly recommend staying here for the following reasons. The rooms are furnished in a contemporary style of earth tones with all the conveniences of home. It features: WIFI, telephone, TV, mini bar , however, one rarely stays in the room only to change in the evening to go out.. The bathroom is quite spacious with a large shower (great) and the closet is enough for two for a couple of days. A safe is available to store your passport and other important documents, nevertheless, you don't have to worry about theft. The design of the hotel is very unique as it has both a old and new feel, with embellishments of various styles. Once you enter into the hotel, you think...modern but strange as it is rectangular in shape and the lobby is on the other side of the reception. It is quite small but useful while waiting for friends. You can see the breakfast area and dining room through the giant glass doors, although, we never ate at the hotel, I'm sure it's convenient for families. There is a bar and a comfortable living room area next to the bar (away from the reception) so one can gab with friends or have a cocktail before going out or enjoy a nightcap before retiring. The staff is professional but rather impersonal...which I thought was strange for Spaniards, however, these are Catalan, they are quite different so don't expect them loud boisterous. The hotel is a rather quiet and peaceful of which I highly recommend. Overall: Rooms: Some might find it small but it is very convenient and clean. Showers & toilet: wonderful Food: We never ate there since restaurants abound near the hotel. SPA/gym: none Pool: none Reception: professional Bar: reasonable but some say pricey Price: OK, for a hotel of this caliber, however, its a bit pricey for some Location: Perfect If you are looking for convenience and location then this is the place to be.

I didn't see the rooms but would suggest upgrading (although beds were firm and showers were good) Also noise levels not great .....

I agree with the other comments here; the location is fantastic, as long as you don't turn left out the door of the reception area. Our taxi driver (inept) left us about 500 meters from the hotel up the Sant Pau street and we had to wheel our luggage to the hotel. Obviously not the hotel's fault, but I was propositioned by hookers, offered drugs, etc. walking to the hotel with my wife. Not a pleasant experience. That said, the hotel itself is some sort of historic landmark. Tour guides actually take groups to the lobby to show off the fantastic decor, which has been completely resotred and/or upgraded. The rooms are nice, not too cramped, with great modern bathrooms and \"rain-shower\" style shower heads. Cons: I found the street fairly noisy. Ended up buying earplugs after the first night. The hotel sits right off La Ramblas, so you get a lot of overflow traffic coming and going. Yelling and screaming at all hours of the night. 16 Euro for 24 hours of wi-fi is a crime. I can't figure out why these 4 and 5 star hotels don't just give away free wi-fi as a perk. However, my wife booked through the hotel site, which had a free wi-fi offer, so that was a help. However some friends booked through one of the internet booking services and had to pay for wi-fi. I also thought the 20 Euros for a very limited breakfast buffet to be highway robbery. Go up to the Ramblas, turn left and walk about 20 meters to Escrib\u00e1, a classic Barcelona bakery and sweet shop, for your coffee and a croissant etc. In addition, the hotel is undergoing a remodel of the facade, and our windows had scaffolding and safety nets in front of them. Not that the view would have been anything spectacular, there is an apartment building right across Sant Pau, about 5 meters away from your window. Pros: Excellent location close to Ramblas and the Liceu Metro stop. Very cool rooftop bar with palapa/cabana style lounges. Our friends upgraded to room 503, on the top floor, which has a nice private deck. I think it was something like 30 euros per night more, and I would recommend it if you go when the weather is half-way decent. A cold beer or glass of wine under the stars is nice. The staff is also very helpful. I had a package sent to me from Italy and it didn't arrive until after I departed.

Room was cleaned every day with fresh towels (even on a Sunday). Hotel staff were very friendly and happy to help.

Management must be resting on the laurels of their parent hotel, the Condesa de Barcelona. We arrived, had lunch at the beautiful Fonda Espana and then waited a very long time for Miguel at the front desk to finish his phone conversation. He should have at least acknowledged us, standing in front of him, but he didn't. He just went on talking and talking. After many minutes, he hung up and started our registration. No apology or thanks for waiting. He addressed me by my last name without using a \"Mrs\" or \"Senyora\". It was as if he were a zombie. He didn't offer to call a bellboy to help with our big suitcases either. Another TA member mentioned a mix-up with the Wifi. Miguel tried to charge us for that too but I pointed out that I had booked the room directly on their website, which enabled me to get the Wifi for free. Every day, I had to call downstairs and ask for the new code of the day. The signal was so weak that we used the Wifi very little. This is not the standard of a 4 star hotel! During this trip, we stayed in more than 5 hotels and none of them charged for Wifi. Some of them were only 2-3 stars. The hotel has air conditioning in the public rooms but skimps on air con in the guest rooms. We had 2 vents but only 1 actually had cool air coming out. When we asked about a/c, the front desk sent a maintenance man up. He put his hand up near the working vent (but not the other) and pronounced everything in working order. I asked why the air current felt the same whether we had it set for High or Low. He didn't have an answer. The thermometer registered 19 degrees but it felt much hotter. The front desk confirmed that the room was 25 degrees (ie they have the modern technology installed to monitor room temperature). The shower leaked water all over the floor. The sink and shower basins were so shallow (3 inches at most) that dirty water often splashed back up. Whoever designed those fixtures probably never washes himself more than 30 seconds. The Bar Arnau is open only for breakfast and occasional in the afternoon. The day we arrived, it was closed by 6 pm. We were having a Tripadvisor party and we ended up entertaining on the roof terrace. The pool had been closed for several days before our arrival. It was tiny anyway. I'm glad we got a special advance booking rate of 110 euros (no b'fast). If I had paid 130+ euros, I would have been really dissatisfied. I had asked for a quiet room. Unfortunately, our room faced the balcony of a hostel and young people were partying nightly until past 4 am. Although there were 2 vents for air con, only 1 vent had a weak stream of cool air.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limassol, Cyprus", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "VladimirCY", "ReviewID": "UR116019500", "Content": "Situated a minute walk away from the Las Ramblas, this hotel has an excellent location close to one of the main tourist streets in Barcelona.

It used to be a monestary and has undergone two major renovations. The first one was its conversion to a hotel in the early 1900s and the second one it is just completing. I think the pool is now operating which completes the overhaul. I was on a business/pleasure trip in Barcelona two weeks ago and stayed there for four nights. For ease of review for fellow travellers I will give a pro and con outline of the place: Pro: Great central location. Literally a couple of hundred yards off the Rambla right next to the Licea. 10-15 minute walk to the waterfront. Three minutes from the Boqueria market. It is on a narrow street and some travellers may feel uncomfortable late at night/early morning traversing to and from the hotel. We always felt safe but were also cautious. New decor and linens. Small but nice bathroom. Clean, with a big glass walled shower. There were plenty of soaps, shampoos, towels and lotions. Staff was friendly. The bartender chipper. Cons: Small room. The queen size bed (two twins put together) took up the whole room. If you sat in the chair in front of the desk at the foot of the bed a person could not get around you. Price. 240 euros per night. We got this room on only about a week notice. probably could have shopped around and got more bang for the buck. Although, the room was allegedly non-smoking, the room had either been smoked in regularly or the ventilation brought in cigarette smoke. We addressed this with the front desk and we were assured that the entire floor was non-smoking. Breakfast was very expensive. It would have cost about 40 euros per person. We were supposed to have internet service included in our price but when we got there we were informed we were mistaken. Internet service, which included cable tv was another 18 euros per 24 hours. I didn't argue about it, life is too short to fuss about stuff like that. There appeared to be some kind of issue with the bathroom venting. Conclusion: We chose this hotel because it had a roof top deck and pool. Unfortunately, neither were open during our stay and no mention was made of this on their website or when we booked the room. Some construction was taking place during our stay and huge drills reverbrated the entire building by 9 am some mornings. The restaurant and bar were nice but expensive compared to some surrounding restaurants. The decor and ambiance was cool. I would stay there again if I could secure a better rate, the pool was open and I could pick a little bigger and better ventilated room.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA Gem in the heart of the city\u201d", "Author": "ScubyDoo", "ReviewID": "UR115753256", "Content": "Just off Las Ramblas this hotel is in a perfect location.

The room was quiet, and though it wasn't particularly bright (it looked out onto a small courtyard) it didn't matter as we only had to sleep there! It had a mini bar that was fairly empty apart from two complimentary bottles of water and juice, but sadly no tea/coffee facilities, which is always nice to have. We didn't eat in the hotel but it is close enough to the market and a little bakery/coffee shop where you can have breakfast. It's in the middle of La Rambla, literally 30 seconds walk from the tube station Liceu, and about 5-10 mins walk (depending on your pace!) from Placa Catalunya (where the airport bus goes) and the bottom of La Rambla where the Columbus monument is.

A lot of people had warned us not to stay in that area, and despite stories of muggings etc on La Rambla and the streets surrounding it we had no problems - the only thing is that the main street is very busy with street perfomers and people trying to get your money for some reason or another, but they can be avoided if you just keep walking...I can't comment on the pool as it wasn't in operation in May, which is normal for Spain, but the rooftop doesn't have spectacular views, so if you are looking for a view then it's best to try one of the taller hotels - this one only had about 6 floors.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth", "Title": "\u201cHotel Espana\u201d", "Author": "wildlox", "ReviewID": "UR110279959", "Content": "Great Location in the La Rumbla area, close to shops, piazzas and just a general buzz", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich", "Title": "\u201cPool not in use !!\u201d", "Author": "Redloverr", "ReviewID": "UR108465866", "Content": "The main reason why we chose this hotel was the roof top pool.

For the most part, I share the positive views of other reviewers. The room and bathroom were pleasant, the location was central. The common areas of the hotel are stunning. We were however disappointed by our stay for one particular reason. I had booked the hotel for my boyfriend as a birthday gift. His one request was that we go to a hotel with a rooftop pool so that he could have a morning dip. On booking.com and on the hotel's own website, it was stated that the hotel has such a rooftop pool. When we arrived (in May and 26 degree heat) the pool was in fact empty of water save for an inch of dirty rain water! We were, needless to say, extremely disappointed. We would quite simply have booked another hotel if we had been made aware that there would be no pool at the Hotel Espana during our stay. We were somewhat affronted that the hotel advertised such a facility with no specification as to the dates that it would not be available. May is hardly off season. It is for this reason that I have felt driven to write my first Trip Advisor review! Service at the hotel was generally fine but when we raised minor complaints they were not dealt with. The first was that the English TV channels in our room were not working, the second was that one of the bedside lamp light bulbs had gone. Neither of these issues were addressed despite our attempts to follow up. Not really 4* service but not exactly the end of the world. We were pretty disappointed that there was no free WiFi, when we asked we were told it was \u20ac16 for 24 hours, a bit steep in my view. We cannot comment on breakfast as we considered it too expensive (I think it was about \u20ac15 each per day). We went to the nearby La Boqueria market and had lovely breakfasts at the tapas bars there instead. The hotel itself is on a rather insalubrious alleyway off La Rambla. There were quite a number of dodgy characters about but as it was busy and well lit we weren't too concerned. The noise in our room wasn't bad in light of the very central location.

It has a very boutique hotel feel and the bathroom is just great along with a very impressive shower. The hotel is situated 2 seconds off La Ramblas right in the centre of everything so your not far away from anything. Having the metro at the end of the road helps too as this is very convenient if your thinking of going on the metro. (highly recommended to get about) We didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast but the food we saw in the bar looked great. The breakfast was very good too and catered for everything. Upon booking the hotel we released that there was a small swimming pool on the roof terrace but unfortunately it was not filled with water. This was a little disappointing as we had told our daughter about it and she was excited about this. Maybe this was due to the season beginning to start. No big deal All in all this hotel is totally fantastic and can't really be faulted. If I was to draw on a negative. It would be that the windows need to be better insulated for sound proofing. As Barcelona is a lively city and being in the middle of everything you would expect noise but on our last night we did not sleep at all due to the noise in the street below. This could be seen as a huge drawback but this should not put you off staying at the totally wonderful hotel. We will certainly return but ask for a room on the inside part of the hotel and not on the Carrer de sant Pau. In a nutshell.

One escorted us to our room and showed us how to work everything, very pleasant and both spoke English fluently. We stayed in an executive room which had a comfortable king size bed, wide screen plasma TV, monsoon shower, double sinks in the bathroom, mini bar with bottled water and fruit juice (complimentary), desk, wardrobe and a safe. The room had a small balcony which looked out onto the street below, not much natural day light in the room but this didn't matter as we were out most of the time. No noise from the street, good double glazing! Lovely mood lighting in the room and air-conditioning which was easy to control. Fresh white dressing gowns and slippers were provided for each of us to use, made the stay even more luxurious. We didn't eat in the hotel, but purely because there was so much choice on La Rambla (1 minute walk away) Only complaint is that there was a half-empty bottle of juice in our mini bar. Also, the housekeepers knocked and came into the room at 9am despite having the 'do not disturb' sign up. The swimming pool was closed as it wasn't peak season - a shame as it was about 23degrees! Did not take away from the enjoyment of our stay - will definately go back!", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Peterborough, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place to stay\u201d", "Author": "ambrosio93", "ReviewID": "UR101128973", "Content": "We spent 6 nights at this hotel.

It was inside facing with doors opening into the interior which sounds a bit odd but works well. We asked for fresh air instead of air conditioning. Staff were all excellent.

Very clean area, easy with the Liceu underground only 3 minutes walk away ( get your bearings when you come up out of the underground - the one exit is immediately opposite, the others are some distance. Hotel staff very friendly, helped with maps and advice. Room was smart and clean furnished in a modern style -Paid for internet 16 Eur for 24hrs, nice coffee shops open early so you dont need the breakfast. Receprion staff sold us bus tour ticket packs at a discount which was good and we caught the tour bus at the cathedral Suggest if you want to see the Gaudi Cathedral (the other one) you make a very early start as the queue was long!

What a wonderful experience. The hotel was just renovated and the rooms were beautiful. the stairways were very stylish. The location is right off the center of the Rambla in a street that is blocked for cars most of the day so it was very quite. The rooms were OK size for this kind of location. We had free wi-fi. The staff was incredibly friendly (I guess they like kids!) and helpful. The bell-boy even gave me a 2-for-1 discount ticket when he understood we are going to the zoo... The only downsides were that I didn't have a kettle (which I needed for my baby) and I couldn't find how to activate the fridge. I could also here my children from across the hall when the door was open. At the check out they let me keep the room a few more hours.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat find in the heart of Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "JulianMVMills", "ReviewID": "UR88990851", "Content": "Spent two nights in this newly refurbished hotel; was a bit suspect as thought it was a 2 start but it really is a 4 star.

Ignore any previous comments about builders, they were almost finshed and did not impact our stay one bit.
