Amazing location, you can pop back to hotel easily when you get tired and set off again. Tea in rooms which is really nice for a break too. Definitely worth paying the extra for a room over the canal as there is much to see from the window. Noisy if the window is left open but that's all part of the atmosphere. Room lovely and bathroom really clean - fab shower. i would say the worst thing is the breakfasst. Everyday scrabbled egg and bacon swimming in water. croissants filled with jam or cream and ot labelled so youdon't know which you're getting.

Checked in on a Thursday just before noon and was pleased to be upgraded to a junior suite without even asking. Room 274 had a nice view on the narrow side canal where there was always something interesting going on. The suite itself was very nice and spotlessly maintained. Large marble bathroom with one of those funny European shower systems--be careful or you will flood the floor. Middle room for seating and TV. Also included was a complete coffee-tea kettle and even better, one of those fancy iperespresso machines which produced an amazing cup of espresso. The bedroom was separate and included a very comfortable bed with luxury linens. Though it is included in the price, I did not try the morning breakfast. I did however order room service several nights. There are actually two room service menus, one available 24 hours and one available from their own restaurant during hours the restaurant is open. I ordered from the 24 hour menu and the service was prompt but there was a language problem upon ordering that resulted in one of my dinners not being what I ordered. Not a big deal and what was delivered was tasty enough. As others have mentioned, the location of this hotel is ideal in my opinion. In addition, if you take a water taxi from the airport and return, the hotel has its own little dock which is very convenient. The hotel staff will order your taxi in advance if you wish.

This was what they called an 'American breakfast'. A really nice touch was they knew it was my birthday and left a small gift and a personal note - those chocolates were delicious!! Another really sweet thing was that they provided a weather forecast for the following morning with the turn down service. The room overlooked the restaurant (rather than the canal) so we could hear the piano player in the evening, but there was no noticeable issue noise at breakfast time (so sleep ins were still possible).

I payed a bit extra and stayed in a superior room with canal view. I did expect the room to be bigger than it was though... and did phone and ask that I had the right room type (as it was meant to be bigger than the deluxe rooms) as I couldn't imagine the room could be an awful lot smaller. But apart from that, couldn't fault the room - it was beautifully furnished and the bed, linen, bathroom were all immaculate. The coffee was rubbish though - get tea and grab coffee on the go!

I did a lot of research when choosing a hotel and thought the Splendid gave affordable luxury and the location was great for a first visit to Venice. We arrived by water taxi from the airport and even though \u00e2\u201a\u00ac120 it was well worth it for a fast, fun treat. When arriving I did wonder how the hell would we have found our way! Hotel has its own landing area on the side canal. I booked a standard room but when we arrived we were shown room 511 which was on the top floor and had a lovely terrace with a table and 2 chairs with a view of the tower in the square. Below was a side canal. The room was not massive but I had read that Venice rooms are small. It was perfect for us and we thought very smart. Stunning! Lucky us! It was an upgrade so thank you Splendid/Citalia! The bed was amazing and very comfy. The pillow menu we did not use as we found our pillows were lovely. I want the bed and pillows/duvet for home! Breakfast was nice, we found it tasty and the selection was plenty enough. I never got a chocolate croissant despite going very early a few days. :-( never mind, there are lst of other yummy things to have. We always managed to sit in the conservatory which was lovely. The staff in the hotel were very nice. The bar men were very good. Location was really good and so central. The map they gave us on arrival was really useful. We still got lost but half the fun! One tip, if you get lost and are near the Ferrari shop, the take the alley next to it which has Splendid in tiles in the floor follow it and you will come out right inbetween the main building and reception door - ditto to following the alley to the Ferrari shop which is what we did on day 3 and could have saved getting lost a few times. Didn't eat in the hotel for dinner but perhaps we should have. Had a horrid meal at the restaurant opposite so please avoid! Had a wonderful time and so glad I chose this hotel. My only negative comment is that on day 4 a very large group arrived (an American jewellery company). I felt that the way they took over the Lobby and set up tables as \"their area\" was very off and unfair for the other guests and they took over. They all met for dinner and the meeting place was this area. 40 + people all standing blocking the small area for everybody else to try and get past was horrid, it was impossible to get out of the lift to either go to the bar or walk in/out of the hotel. They (the hotel or the organisers of the group) did not leave an area for other guests to be able to get past. The hotel should have placed these tables either in the very back of the restaurant so they had their own area, or in the corner by the downstairs toilets (and still leaving a pathway for anybody who still needed the facilities). Just felt it needed a mention as I did feel our peace was shattered just due to the way it was organised/done and there were quite a few other guests there (couples like myself) so our holiday should have been considered. Also I was happy with the room temperature but my husband felt hot. There was no way to control the temperature/turn the heat off. Luckily he could have to door open when he needed/at night due to our room being high. I feel I would like to go back to Venice in the future. Would I stay at the Splendid? Yes.

The lounge bar area of the hotel is very relaxing and gondalas can be seen cruising along the canal whilst sipping bellini cocktails served with delicious canapes. The restaurant area has been built around an atrium with a glass roof. Breakfasts consist of croissants, fruit salad as well as the usual hot buffet fayre. We had a wonderful meal one evening and the candlelit dining area added to the ambience of the setting. The wine list is reasonably extensive as well. The location is superb as you are 5 minutes either way from the Rialto and St Marks Square with excellent shopping thrown in for good measure just outside the hotel. The receptionists were helpful to us in locating the Venice Jazz club and a small deli \"Alle Arco\"", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne", "Title": "\u201cA most pleasant stay\u201d", "Author": "kahkityoong", "ReviewID": "UR125203679", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for 4 days during the recent Carnevale.

My deluxe room with a canal view was reasonably spacious by Venetian standards. I enjoyed the spotless modern feel to it. Internet access in the room is charged but free wifi is available in the public areas. The hot breakfast was quite good by Italian standards (remember locals don't do the hot bacon and eggs stuff) and apart from the cheese and cold meats, bacon and eggs were also served in the buffet.

Splendid! I booked a double superior room for the carnival weekend. I arrived February 16 and stayed for 3 nights. My room overlooked a narrow street which was not noisy. The music from the tv was piped into the marble bathroom ...I loved the bathroom. There were complimentary toiletries i.e. lotion, shampoo and bath gel.. The hotel staff were wonderful. My room was so comfortable and of course being that I live in Rome and have only a shower, the bathtub was heavenly. The bed was super comfortable... and I also had a kettle with complimentary coffee... nice touch for first thing in the a.m. I loved the lounge. It over looks the small canal and the seating is really plush and full of pillows. I discovered this hotel the weekend prior when a friend had taken me there for cocktails. It is a very romantic setting and something I will never forget...the Gondola's stream by slowly like some sort of Discovery video. The bartender Marco is courteous and professional and the staff in the restaurant went out of their way to make me comfortable when I had dinner...I've never had so many men waiting on me. The hotel room was pretty quiet the only time I noticed noise was on my last evening when a Japanese tourist was yelling from his bathtub to another family member (for heaven's sake). For those that are particular with hotel room details I will provide the following information: the hotel room floor was a bit beaten up and there was a large crack on the mirror frame that surrounds the flat screen tv. The doors on either side of the hotel room I was in slammed shut quite loudly and it would shake my room as I am sure mine did although I would try to stop it from slamming. I am only mentioning this to give an honest review. I slept really well ... LOVED the bed. One morning I had breakfast in my room...amazing...they brought it right on time, the lady was courteous.. they had put an orchid in a small glass and I had ample food.

So why not take the vaporetto which is 20 something return? Well before you decide that is the best idea have a look on google map because you are going to be wheeling your luggage quite a long way from st marks where you will get off. Now the private taxi will take you right there to the hotel doors . So make your decision based on how fit you are and whether you have three kids a baby and luggage for a round the world trip. This advice applies to pretty much all hotels in Venice. Secondly my room was small, but to be honest so what it was in a nice hotel very close to st marks. If you want a scenic view or a big room pay extra, you can. Venice is old and hotels are higgledy piggledy and rooms will not all be the same. My room only had a shower my friend who paid the same price had a bigger room with a bath. The price during carnival was like 140 including breakfast which was a steal. The place has good service and the staff were pretty helpful which is standard for Venice Breakfast was good, fresh fruit , bacon etc no issue there at all. One final tip eat at trattoria San basilio the best place in Venice a brisk 30 minute walk away. Real food served by real people well off the tourist track. A few more final tips Do not anywhere where the menu is in Russian, in fact anywhere the menu is in 4 or more languages Head way from the crowds and the guides there is loads to see off the beaten track and why there are hundreds of people in one church not the other I have no idea. All of Venice is great it's safe and it's impossible to get really lost Finally finally use your feet you see more but the public transport is all good value and fun", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cA very splendid experience at the splendid!\u201d", "Author": "englishrose1981", "ReviewID": "UR124476403", "Content": "Loved this hotel, location couldn't be better - perfectly positioned between St Marks square and the Rialto bridge.

The grapefruit juice was in fact squash (watered down - not fresh juice - or at least that's what it tasted like), the scrambled egg had pieces of egg shell in it, they only had white rolls for bread and a small selection of cheese cut to sticks. The fruitsallad tasted of nothing. The best part of the breakfast were the slovenian yoghurts and the pineapple juice. In general a good hotel though (can always go somewhere else for breakfast) and would probably stay here again. Would recommend eating in the nice cozy restaurant called Ostaria al Diavo'lo L'Aquasanta which is accross the Rialto bridge, only a short walk from the hotel.

The only real critical thing I have to say is that the Front Desk staff were not very friendly (which I find hard to accept when you are in the Hospitality business).

We had one question at check in and the gentleman said he would call us in our room to give us the answer. He never called. But the rest of the stay was great. The rooms are very nice - good size (we were not in a suite) and nice furnishings. The beds were basically comfortable, but one problem - ours seemed to have indentations on either side of the mattress. Housekeeping did a nice job each day, and the housekeepers were very friendly in the hallways. Bathrooms are great - our's had a nice tub/shower. The wi-fi was not very reliable - I ended up going down to the lobby to use the free wi-fi there (you need to get the code from the front desk). Location of this place was great - especially for your first stay in Venice. It's right in the middle of everything, and easy to get anywhere. We arrived by AliLaguna boat at St. Marks and walked to the hotel. It was fine - not a far walk, and no stairs. But you had to make a few turns that were not on the hotel's website directions. We still found it - no big deal. We ate in the hotel restuarant the first night because we were too tired to go out. It was good, and the service was friendly. The breakfast was fine.

This one will not disappoint. It has been fully renovated very recently, and our room was lovely & spotlessly clean, with fab toiletries. I am very picky too. We booked a luxury double with canal view. The room was no bigger than a standard modern hotel room in England, but the decor had a luxury feel, small but perfectly formed, with lots of lovely mirrors giving a airy feel. We were above the hotel private docking station(room 411), and it was great fun watching the Gondolers, private taxis and general boats going up and down. I didn't find it noisy at all, just fascinating. The breakfast was fine, fresh fruit, cereals, ham, cheese bread, pastries, cakes & yogurts. The public spaces are wonderful (check out the loos near the reading area/restaurant) The staff were very polite, and helpful. WE used the luggage room on our last day, as we didn't need to leave until 5pm, very easy, and all free. We flew into Marco Polo Airport, then took the water bus, (all sign posted, turn left as you leave the baggage hall, and the ticket office is just there inside) NOT water taxi, to st marks square (San Marco) we arrived at 11.30pm. It took 1hr 20, but felt much shorter, and it was very magical & relaxing arriving at that time . It cost 13 Euro per person. They go every hour at night. The private water taxis are about 100 Euro i think, but they look fantastic, very james bond, if you can afford it, i should think its brilliant. The hotel is 5 mins from there. How to find it? Easy when you know how! I got very anxious about all this before i went, i did my research and asked the questions and it was so simple in the end, so let me share it with you. When you get off the water bus (alilaguna lines is the official operator) take a left over the bridges, here you can take in 'The Bridge of Sighs' then you can't miss st marks square (san Marco) as you walk in you will see the campomile on your left (huge bell tower) and St Marks Basillaca on your right, walk straight ahead to the end, can you see 'American Snack bar'? (the water should be behind you) take that street, walk right to the top (2 mins), see the farrari shop? take the street to the right of it, this is technically an alley i suppose, but most importantly, it is flat, with no steps or bridges and if you have your luggage, thats important. You will come to the canal at the end, and either side is the hotel . On the right should be reception. Easy! Ask for a map when you check in too (there free). I found Venice very safe at night, and we walked all over. San marco is heaving with day trippers, so doing the sights there is best at around 4.30 when the q's have eased. Does it smell????? NO! it was 80 degrees when we were there, and it didn't smell or flood. You get the odd smell of a drain, but no more than any other hot country. We went for my 40th birthday without our children, and it was just the most amazing place. It was full of really nice people just like you and me, adoring the the spendour and uniqueness of the place. We were there for 3 full days. Yes, the food is expensive, and on balance, you probably wont go far wrong eating in the hotel, we didn't. Bottles of wine are probably a better bet than a glass, as the measures are very small and are about 4 euro a glass. Oh, i forgo to say, the location is excellent, its the kind of place you would walk past and say, \"oh, i wish we had stayed there\". Also, when we booked it with lastminute.com, on check out, it said they were painting the facade this summer, they are not, it was all done last year, so don't panic.! If you don't book this place, be carefull about booking on the Grande Canal, especially around rialto or san marco as these places are very noisy day & night. Rialto is good and buzzy on a night for bars etc. though. Enjoy, if you want to ask any questions please email me at lisa@thechapman.plus.com.

They don't even offer alternative solutions like public boats etc. unless you specifically ask for them.

The room was overheated, we tried to cool it down to no avail, the air conditioning didn't seem to kick-in at all. All in all except for the location, the decent breakfast and the spacious rooms this hotel doesn't have much to recommend itself for the price they charge. Tip: If you are looking for transportation from the Venice Train Station to the hotel, just take the public boats, its a quick 5 minute walk from Rialto bridge to the hotel and only costs 6 euros as opposed to the 90+ euros that they water taxi will charge. Tip: There are also public boats starting at 7 AM from the Rialto bridge to the airport which cost 15 euro, again significantly cheaper than 130 euro that a water taxi will charge.

Location is absolutely perfect for the first time visitor and we basically walked everywhere occasionally resting with a glass of prosecco at the many bars and cafes. We decided to splash out and arrive at the hotel by water taxi.

The hotel itself is modern, clean and staff were very helpful especially to recommend restaurants or make bookings on your behalf. As it was our first wedding anniversary, I had contacted the hotel prior to arrival requesting a canal view. We did get one but it was at the side of the hotel overlooking a back street where many deliveries were made so if you're after a more pleasing, quieter canal outlook, request a room at the front of the hotel, the view is much better. The room itself wasn't overly spacious but was perfect for our requirements, modern, clean and well maintained although the bathroom shower required a little maintenance, the shower was a tad temperamental. Our stay included breakfast which was pretty basic with a few cereals, breads, cheese and cold meats. The cooked option consisted of bacon and scrambled egg so not really much choice although their cappucinos were great. If it hadn't been included, I certainly wouldn't have paid extra for it, particularly with the many cafes nearby offering much more appetising wares for less.

Its very close to San Marco Square, less than five minutes walking distance. We spent a lot of time at night in San Marco just to have a coffee, a gelato listening to the three different classical band playing nightly, They played music until midnight every night. Its super romantic to be in San Marco late at night when there are less people, so you can sit and talk with your love one under the moonlight. Venice is a very romantic and surprising city so don't be afraid to explore. We spent hours walking around, exploring the city, and with every turn into a seemingly lost alley, you'll find a church, an exclusive five stars hotel, a great restaurant or simply a small place to sit and absorb the feel of the city. It is sad to know that Venice is slowly sinking and one day will disappear. We loved our stay and the only regret is not staying longer. We will definitely be back and will love to stay at the Spendide again.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Woodland, California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful!\u201d", "Author": "HurricaneKat23", "ReviewID": "UR118201105", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel as year on our trip through on our trip through Italy.

Left the next morning and boarded Vaporetto at Rialto station. While standing beside my luggage, I saw a small red-brown bug crawling on my suitcase.

There was muesli and corn flakes and fresh cheeses, cold meats and ham. Not my kind of holiday breakfast but hey what was on offer was of a high standard. You could order from the menu for breakfast but this was at an extra cost. I think a fried egg was 6 Euros! Staff were very helpful, friendly yet professional. Venice superb, so romantic but eating in restaurants proved to be very expensive. If you like a lot of good food then you will need to eat multiple courses, which proves to become costly. The cheapest bottle of red wine was 20 Euros in the restaurants, a bottle of beer 6 Euros. Shopping in and around Venice is fantastic especially as the sales are on at the moment.

As we left very early in the morning and had to miss the buffet breakfast (which was included in our room rate), the hotel prepared two breakfast packs for us. There was little to fancy inside the pack, however, with only two cold bread rolls, one scone, some small jars of jam, one apple, and one bottle of juice. **Hotel as a whole** The hotel's public area, including a small library, restaurant with glass roof, bar, and TV lounge, exudes a cosy atmosphere. It was decorated with velvet drapes, plush cushions, and soft lighting. Actually, the public area is so beautiful that it is a more comfortable and atmospheric place to linger than the bedroom.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Surrey", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!

Close to St Mark's square and the Grand Canal. This is a smart hotel, good decor. Yes, it can be a little dark in the bedrooms but that's down to the nature of the way Venice is built/ the layout! You are going there to see narrow, quaint little lanes and burrows with all the waterways throughout, so it only takes a pinch of common sense to realise that it may shut out some light coming into bedroom windows - Come on guys! - Be reasonable. The gondolas cost approx' \u00c2\u00a370-80 for a 20 min trip and no, most do not sing to you! The food in Venice is fairly expensive as they know they have a captive audience...However, we ate in the hotel twice and out down the back lanes rather than in St Mark's sq. As a rough guide we paid approx \u00c2\u00a330 a head without drink. We walked 6 hours a day for 4 days. I would say 3 days is enough to see the place. It's amazing and well worth going but small and probably best as a stop over to somewhere else for another 4 days or so. I was also told it could be smelly, in April it was hot while we were there. 80 degrees. Very occasionally we got a small pocket of drain smell momentarily but on the whole it was not a smelly place at that time. It was not any issue at all. We would happily stay in this hotel again.

Overall, we were really pleased with the hotel. It was expensive, but the location was great; just a few minutes walk to both the Rialto Bridge and Piazza San Marco. Even though you could be in the thrum of the main tourist areas, you could within moments turn off the main drag and be in quiet back streets with amazing restaurants. We were upgraded to a deluxe canal view room; I think my advice would be to get the superior or deluxe rooms but don't bother paying extra for the canal views; you are really not missing anything and you'll have plenty of time to see much more lovely canals as you walk the streets. The rooms are not large, but more than big enough. Bathrooms also small but well appointed and clean. Breakfast was so-so; standard Continental fare, but not of a particularly high standard. Coffee plush; bread nice; meat and cheese ok-ish. Still, a free meal to start the day is a good way to start! Staff were generally nice and friendly. Bar area was well stocked and we enjoyed coming home after a delicious meal for a nice nightcap. Be warned though that the bar is not cheap; most drinks/wine were \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10 a go... There was no free wifi in the room, and it cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5.50 for 24 hours. Seemed to work ok but connection speed wasn't brilliant. I must say that we both thought that the bed was amazingly comfortable! So overall, a lovely hotel, but not cheap. If you want somewhere central and are willing to pay a bit more then I would recommend this hotel. If you are on a budget then perhaps not; you'll be paying through the nose for everything else so get a cheaper hotel and save your money for good food and wine! On a final note I would certainly urge you to book a private water taxi to and from the airport. It really is an amazing way to arrive, even at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac110 each way. Getting to the hotel from the public vaperetto (water bus) was complicated if you didn't know the way, and the thought of lugging suitcases down those streets through the throng of tourists in the heat of the day didn't sound a nice way to start our holiday. The hotel has it's own dock, so you pull up right outside the hotel; perfect! We rang the hotel and they booked the taxi for us so that when we arrived at the airport, they were expecting us.

We decided to book a deluxe room as the hotel website stated they had a canal view. When we arrived we were shown to a room at the back of the hotel and had been given a small suite but no canal view. The room was so nice we decided to stay put. The furnishings were beautiful, lots of Venetian glass mirrors, silver fittings and muted colours. Bed and pillows were really comfortable (I'm very fussy about bed comfort!) and although the bedroom itself was not large, having the sitting area more than compensated. We had three flat screen TV's, in the bedroom, sitting area and a small one in the bathroom, not that we watched much TV as there is so much to do and out of the 4 days we stayed, the weather was fabulous for November on three of them. Toiletries were really nice, an Italian Brand, Etro, and plenty of them. The bathroom was compact but had quite luxurious fittings and large, fluffy towels. We ate evening meals in the hotel restaurant twice and the standard of food was good. The breakfasts were pretty ok, given it was the usual buffet type breakfast, but there was plenty of variety and the bakery goods were nice. The evening service in the restaurant was good on our first visit but on our second visit they got our order wrong and at first, their attitude was so what? Ater having a strop, the service improved and we got several apologies. They have an excellent pianist in the evenings who obviously loves his job and is very versatile. We sat down for quite a while after dinner just enjoying his playing. This really contributed to the ambience and we enjoyed both visits. I definitely recommend having at least one meal here but it is best to make a reservation as the weekends seem to be busy. The hotel is is a great position, just few minutes from San Marco and Rialto but the address on their website doesn't exist - it just refers to the general area. Other people have mentioned this on TA, it is situated on Manzana St Zulian which is about a 10 to 15 minute walk from Piazzale Roma and about 5 minutes from San Marco. Venice is very expensive but I think the hotel was pretty good value for money overall although I'd advise anyone to beware of the mini-bar! I expect to pay well over the odds but a (very) small pack of peanuts was 7 euros which seemed steep! Shopping in Venice is not a cheap experience, but having said that, Furla, the Italian leather goods company have a couple of shops in the Mercerie and their handbags seemed much cheaper than in the UK! We loved Venice and would definitely go again. My advice is to wear very comfortable shoes as you will do a lot of walking, buy a multi day ticket for the boats, and ensure you take at least one trip up the Grand Canal and visit some of the nearby islands which are well worth a trip. Just wandering around was a great pleasure. November is one of the months when flooding is a real risk and there was some flooding in the San Marco area on a couple of days. A flood warning siren sounds across Venice very early in the morning to alert everyone. The Venetians are well used to coping and raised walkways (tables) appear as it by magic and everyone gets around by using these. Seeing the Piazza flooded is a strange experience but all the water recedes by early afternoon and things return to normal. We had fun watching some of the boats trying to navigate under bridges on some of the smaller canals - some made it, one didn't! The flooding didn't cause us any inconvenience at all and it is certainly something to see! We'll definitely be going back again and will probably choose to stay here as the Hilton is situated on Giudecca which is across the Lagoon. It is a lovely hotel but does entail getting on a boat every time you want to go back and forth, whereas Starhotel Spendid, although a 4*, is really central.

It's quite a large hotel and thus the service was a bit impersonal but we only spent the weekend in Venice and thus hardly spent time at the hotel so it hardly mattered.

The customer service wasn't bad, but it wasn't consistent. It was almost as if the guest relations desk was unfamiliar with the city. When asked for a recommendation for lunch, she told me she could print our a list and give it to me. However, when I went to the front desk, the person there gave me an excellent recommendation, right off the top of his head and he was right on the money. When asking how to get to the airport, one person was very clear on the different modes of transportation while another was clueless when we went back to the desk to some more information that we forgot to ask the first time (ie: what time does the vaporetti start running in the morning). I must say, there was a young lady who checked us in that was most excellent. She was quite efficient and asked us if we had any futher questiosn.

The location of the hotel is really good however given the layout and nature of Venice it is not the easy to find if you have never visited before. The check-in is not till 2pm so if you arrive early you will have to drop off your bags and wonder around this stunning city. If your travelling a long distance this may be a little frustrating but the bar area will be open and you can simpley look straight outside and watch the Gondolas go past. The hotel is very clean and decorated to a high standard. We stayed in a superior room which was equiped with a large bathroom with shower toilet and bidet. Our view was of an alleyway but to be honest we didnt spend much time in the room anyway. There was a flat panel tv, tea and coffee mini bar. Room service available and reception are on hand should need anything at all extra. We only had breakfast at the hotel which does offer evening meal in the restaurant which looked reasonable and smelt great. the breakfast was a good range of pastries and breads fruits juices bacon and egg. The staff were pleaseant and well presented. I would recommend this hotel. some tips for venice itself... If your a first time visitor be aware you will need to get to Venice from Marco Polo airport the most direct way is by water taxi or public water bus. water taxi is E100 one way so if you find a few couples to get one with you it will make it cheaper. (same price regardless of how many travelling). the water bus is much cheaper however it will likely to be very crowded and like a normal bus stop and numerous other places dropping off and picking up. Gondolas at present are E100 for 40 minutes and this is not negotiable even if there are 6 of you its set price. If you just want a picture on one then opt for the crossing Gondola these are dotted throughout the main canal and baisally cross one side to the other for 50 cent. Venice is very expensive to eat and drink around and about. if you fancy a drink in saint marcs square then buy your drinks in one go depending how long you want to be there for as you are charged 12% service charge plus a charge of around E6 for the orchestra that will be playing each time you order! Its a shoppers haven with numerous big name shops including prada chanel gucci etc so bring your credit cards! make sure you take your camera as it is one of the most stunning places to visit enjoy!!", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo, SP", "Title": "\u201cBeyond my wishes\u201d", "Author": "g3300", "ReviewID": "UR79236051", "Content": "Great location, big room (for Venice standards), clean, good breakfast.

I proposed to my fiance in Piazza San Marco and was looking for a nice hotel. All of the Grand Canal hotels with views were booked already so I was looking for something with a more intimate feel but wanted to be sure there were contemporary accommodations...i.e decent bathroom...a large bed and enough room. Definitely lucked out with room 512. After looking at the building several times I realized we were in only one of a few rooms with a balcony. Although we didn't spend much time in the room, it was nice to have a moment on a balcony big enough for a couple of chairs and a table so we could relax for a few minutes before and after dinner. it overlooked a very small canal and had a view of the Campanile in San Marco. Top floor room with a great view of the Venice roof tops. I am from the states and decided to bring a box of chocolate for the front desk (See's candy). I did mention to the staff that the chocolate from the states is not even close in comparison to chocolate in Italy but wanted to show my appreciation for their service. generally a nice gesture since the front desk probably doesn't get treated too often....this may have had something to do with the great room selection we got. Venice is definitely a special place when compared to my somewhat limited exposure to Italy and other parts of Europe. We went to Milan to spend the weekend after so we could go to the F1 race. When we had to catch our flight late late the following day out of Venice, we hurried back from Milan so we could walk the streets of Venice briefly to enjoy again. We both decided that we would love to come back to the Splendid because of the very cool boutique contemporary feel and excellent location. After getting over the initial sticker shock of Venice hotels in general, I was really happy and will be back as soon as i can afford another trip to Italy. BTW, I did win some points with my fiance by proposing in Italian and English.....definitely made it a hard act to follow amongst our friends. Also, the Bistro D Venice (sp?) was an incredible place for dinner....originally recommended by the hotel, I had forgot the name and ended up having dinner there anyway because of the great vibe when walking by....expensive but our best dinner in Italy. I know it sounds very promotional but I used to wait tables a long time ago and the service was awesome.

This one will not disappoint. It has been fully renovated very recently, and our room was lovely & spotlessly clean, with fab toiletries. I am very picky too. We booked a luxury double with canal view. The room was no bigger than a standard modern hotel room in England, but the decor had a luxury feel, small but perfectly formed, with lots of lovely mirrors giving a airy feel. We were above the hotel private docking station(room 411), and it was great fun watching the Gondolers, private taxis and general boats going up and down. I didn't find it noisy at all, just fascinating. The breakfast was fine, fresh fruit, cereals, ham, cheese bread, pastries, cakes & yogurts. The public spaces are wonderful (check out the loos near the reading area/restaurant) The staff were very polite, and helpful. WE used the luggage room on our last day, as we didn't need to leave until 5pm, very easy, and all free. We flew into Marco Polo Airport, then took the water bus, (all sign posted, turn left as you leave the baggage hall, and the ticket office is just there inside) NOT water taxi, to st marks square (San Marco) we arrived at 11.30pm. It took 1hr 20, but felt much shorter, and it was very magical & relaxing arriving at that time . It cost 13 Euro per person. They go every hour at night. The private water taxis are about 100 Euro i think, but they look fantastic, very james bond, if you can afford it, i should think its brilliant. The hotel is 5 mins from there. How to find it? Easy when you know how! I got very anxious about all this before i went, i did my research and asked the questions and it was so simple in the end, so let me share it with you. When you get off the water bus (alilaguna lines is the official operator) take a left over the bridges, here you can take in 'The Bridge of Sighs' then you can't miss st marks square (san Marco) as you walk in you will see the campomile on your left (huge bell tower) and St Marks Basillaca on your right, walk straight ahead to the end, can you see 'American Snack bar'? (the water should be behind you) take that street, walk right to the top (2 mins), see the farrari shop? take the street to the right of it, this is technically an alley i suppose, but most importantly, it is flat, with no steps or bridges and if you have your luggage, thats important. You will come to the canal at the end, and either side is the hotel . On the right should be reception. Easy! Ask for a map when you check in too (there free). I found Venice very safe at night, and we walked all over. San marco is heaving with day trippers, so doing the sights there is best at around 4.30 when the q's have eased. Does it smell????? NO! it was 80 degrees when we were there, and it didn't smell or flood. You get the odd smell of a drain, but no more than any other hot country. We went for my 40th birthday without our children, and it was just the most amazing place. It was full of really nice people just like you and me, adoring the the spendour and uniqueness of the place. We were there for 3 full days. Yes, the food is expensive, and on balance, you probably wont go far wrong eating in the hotel, we didn't. Bottles of wine are probably a better bet than a glass, as the measures are very small and are about 4 euro a glass. Oh, i forgo to say, the location is excellent, its the kind of place you would walk past and say, \"oh, i wish we had stayed there\". Also, when we booked it with lastminute.com, on check out, it said they were painting the facade this summer, they are not, it was all done last year, so don't panic.! If you don't book this place, be carefull about booking on the Grande Canal, especially around rialto or san marco as these places are very noisy day & night. Rialto is good and buzzy on a night for bars etc. though. Enjoy, if you want to ask any questions please email me at lisa@thechapman.plus.com.

We had no problem finding the hotel from the Railway station to the Rialto Bridge. Had stayed in Maestre last October but wanted something within walking distance of St. Mark's Square. It was less than 5 minutes away and a little bit longer to the Rialto Bridge. Booked through Expedia.ca and got a very good price of approximately $230 Canadian per night. When we arrived in the morning the room that I had requested was not ready but we were offered another room which was ready. As we had come by overnight train from Paris we were quite tired. This room 370 was a large corner room with 2 big beds .It overlookined the alleyway to the hotel from one window and looked down into the restaurant from the other. it was very clean and peaceful. The bathroom was outstanding all done in Marble. We enjoyed the breakfast as there were 3 cereals, scrambled eggs and ham. Great yogurt, juice, bowels of freshly cut fruit , cold meats, cheese, assorted rolls and cake. The cappucino was great as was the coffee which was brought to you in 2 silver jugs. One with coffee and one with hot milk. Never left hungry. Claudia at the Guest services desk was so helpful. Booked us a Vavaldi concert in a small church in St. Marks square. Also gave us lots of other information. The unexpected highlite of our stay was the Andrea Bocelli concert which was on the night after we arrived. Loved walking around St. Marks square during the day and the evening listening to the music. Took a day trip to Murano and Burano which was a very pleasant boat ride. Lovely litle places to walk around . We had not visited the Doges Palace on our last trip. Do not miss it if you have time.

Irritating but nothing a bottle of prosecco couldn't fix! The hotel's position is just off the main drag between St Marks and the Rialto so there is a payoff between convenience and crowds. However it was so easy to find quieter routes to and from the hotel. The breakfast buffet was all you needed to start the day, served in the glassed over hotel courtyard. Venice is so amazing if you venture away form the crowds. Get a book of walks and go to Castello/Arsenale, Dorsoduro (student quarter) and Cannaregio (old Jewish ghetto area). Eating in these parts is so much cheaper and more relaxed. Personally, I'd give Murano a miss with its heaving masses of tourist parties and endless pile it high rip-off shops - you can get better glass bargains in Venice anyway. I'd rather spend more time exploring Burano and Torcello. Yes Venice is expensive and it's hard to find a bargain but if you are going there for cheap you are missing the point.

We had just come from Rome and stayed at their starhotel there. The experience in Rome was 1 star compared to this 5 star. The photos that you see on the website are of this Venice hotel. What you see on the site is what you get. The only downside was that the air condition did not work in all the starhotels we stayed in italy. It got very hot at night. In Venice it was nice to open the windows at night and let the breeze in. The bad thing about Venice is that everything shuts down about 9pm. There arent any shops open. Most restaurants are closed. We arrived at 11:30pm and it was tough to find the hotel. Luckily, there was a nice guy strolling around who led us in the right direction. There isnt much to do in Venice but we were happy that we had a chance to ride on the gondola and experience that. 1 or 2 days in Venice is enough. We found a great Irish Pub very close to the hotel. Served the best food for lunch and really cheap. We went back for dinner but they dont serve dinner. The Peggy Guggenheim museum is closed on Tuesdays which is the day we were there. They have a great exhibit going on that we didnt get to see. Directions: The only way I know how to get to the hotel. From San marco Square. Find the huge clock. Walk right underneath the clock. This street is full of shops and nothing else. You will get to the Cartier jewelry shop. Stand right in front of it facing it. Take a 5 second break. Then walk to the left of the shop. There will be more shops. Just keep going on this street. You will see in some tops corners that it says per Rialto. Follow it until you get to the steps. At the top of the steps is the hotel to the left. There is a revolving door. Go through it. When you get to the top of the steps you should see a Timberland store directly across from the hotel. The name of the hotel is on the side parallel to the river. It is not above the revolving door as you would think it is.

The decor is very neuteral and the crisp white linen was changed every day. We had a balcony with a fantastic view of the bell tower in St Marks square. (see pics). We arrived from the airport by water taxi which has to be the best way to arrive in Venice, the taxi dropped us direct to the hotel's landing stage. I think we may have had difficulty finding the hotel with suitcases etc on our first day if we had taken the public vaporetto. (See if you can share a taxi with another couple from the airport as it is around 100 euros for 4 people with cases one way and it would be the same for 2 people) It takes a while to get your bearings in Venice, but this hotel was right in the middle of San Marco. Five minutes to St Marks square and 5 minutes from Rialto bridge. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The waiting staff were very pleasant at breakfast and we ate one evening meal in the restaurant which was good. Everywhere in Venice is expensive though. To sit in St Marks squre at one of the cafes it will cost you 5.70 euros just for the seat before 8.50 euros for a coffee.

It was a toss-up whether to return in the evening or eat in the hotel. A good tip is to \"Google\" Venice to find web sites which provide information of transport arrangements from the airport. We used the ATVO web site for the Airport Express blue bus, printed off their time table and spent 3 euros each for the 20 mins journey to Piazzale Roma terminous. From there we spent 6.5 euros each on the Vaparetto water bus to the Rialto Bridge and walked 5 mins to the hotel. There are alternative ways of doing the journey, depending on your pocket.

With all the signs showing to these places it is almost impossible really to get lost. You just have to follow either one of the signs and you are never really very far away from the target. Venice is not all that big. Additionally I can really recommend that you buy a card from the local transport-system, which covers all the wterbuses (the vaporettos), which takes you anywhere in Venice in a nice way.

This didn't bother us too much as we were up around that time anyway, but might be a problem if you really want to sleep in. Not that you'd get much chance with all the church bells ringing, but hey, it's Venice.

The hotel is a little tucked away, and about halfway between St Mark's square and the Rialto bridge. We found it easiest to head from the passage to the left of St Mark's (if you're facing it) under the clock and keep walking until you see the Ferrari shop and there's a little passage way down to the hotel (it's marked by a little sign on the floor), or there's a street that runs parallel to the passage a bit further down. It was a little tricky to find at first, but we managed fine. The lobby, somewhat confusingly, is in a separate building to the right of the main hotel if you're facing the canal. Overall we really liked this hotel, and if you're prepared to pay the extra to stay on the main island, it's a good choice.", "Date": "August 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel in perfect location!\u201d", "Author": "Sarah005", "ReviewID": "UR18172103", "Content": "I have just come back from a holiday in Venice where we stayed at the Starhotel Splendid Hotel and we thought this hotel was wonderful.

I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Venice. The rooms are not enormous, but I dont think any are in Venice, however the rooms offer a little bit of luxury at a very affordable price. Only thing to remember is if you are taking the Alilaguna from the airport, you will need to disembark at St Marks Square and walk for about 5-10 minutes.

First of all, pre-communication with Angelica was very helpful. She made our stay special with an upgraded room with a canal view. It was our anniversary and we were greeted with snacks and a cold bottle of Champagne. Perfect! The location could not be more perfect. You're located very close to St Mark's Square in one direction and the Rialto Bridge in the other direction. Our room was modern; linens were high quality with a selection of pillows; breakfast was good; etc. We didn't use the hotel to book any tours like the gondola because their rates were high. We loved the little restaurant right next to the hotel (even though the hotel doesn't \"work\" with them or recommend them). I had the best calamari here with a lovely canal window table. The wait staff borders on being rude at times, so don't expect to be greeted warmly, but do expect a good meal at a decent price with what may be the most quaint canal view in all of Venice. I believe the name of the restaurant is La Sempiore. You can't miss it.....go outside the main lobby to the bridge and it's right there with the flower boxes. You can sit and watch the gondolas float by. We did ride a gondola from this location, but I wouldn't do that again. It was overpriced compared to other locations/times we've taken gondola rides. But, you're in a gondola in Venice......hard to top that! To arrive to the hotel we took the Alilaguna from Marco Polo airport to San Marco square. We made our way through the masses of tourists under the clock tower. When you run into the Ferrari store, you turn right, then an immediate left. You'll think you're lost, but you're not. You go down an alley that turns left then right. You'll see no signs down the alley, but at the end of the alley if you enter the doors in the building on the right side, that is the check-in area. Then, the doors across the alley in the other building are where you enter the hotel lobby. You'll soon learn other ways around the alley's and discover great shopping on the next street over (just walk thru the hotel check-in area and out the other door) and turn right for everything from Cartier to Perle my fave shop to string your own Murano jewlery. If you turn left and go over the bridge you'll find more shopping along the way to the Rialto. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. We've stayed on the Grand Canal, but I much preferred this more intimate setting in the heart of Venice. I've read old reviews about renovations and I didn't see anything going on and believe the entire hotel has now been renovated and it's lovely.

I booked our stay thru one of the hotel websites associated with Tripadvisor, and at 180 Euros per night it was a bargain for Venice (especially taking into account the location and quality of the hotel). The inside of the hotel is very beautiful, with an air that exudes elegance and flair. Nice seating areas on the ground floor, with cushy areas to be seated. Our room was perfect -- graciously appointed -- fabulous bed with very good sheets and a selection of several different types of pillows (if you didn't like the ones on the bed you could order a different type). Marble bathroom, which also had a small TV !! My daughter loved it !! I am still giving the hotel an excellent rating -- but the only downside was that the poor people at the front desk had to deal with absolutely all enquires. This meant that when we were checking in ,during the afternoon and there were at least 15 other people checking in at the same time, the front desk would get a call from someone in a room requesting how to hook up their internet and they would have to take time out to deal with this. I think they are slightly understaffed in this area. But to be fair, I requested a different type of pillow (calling the front desk of course) and it was delivered to my room within 10 minutes. Also, there is plenty of wait staff in the breakfast room during the breakfast (which is included with your room price). As others have mentioned -- great breakfast. Always remember in Italy that when you have an included breakfast you can also get a cappacino. I'm always used to England where only reg coffee or tea is available.

Beautifully, yes beautifully decorated room with all amenities, flat screen TV, coffee and tea facility, lovely toiletries, choice of pillows!!, hardwood floor, large lit wardrobe, light feather down quilts and so on and so forth. Great breakfast in the beautiful restaurant. We're sad that we didn't stay in for dinner but will definitely do so next time.
