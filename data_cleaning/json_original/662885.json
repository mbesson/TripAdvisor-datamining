{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Disappointment! I recently stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in October 2008. The location was great, surrounded by rice paddies and clean air. The welcome was much appreciated with a greeting from all staff and ginger tea and the gardens were fantastic, thanks to the hard-working staff. Breakfast was very average! The staff also arranged for an anniversary cake for us but I do wonder if this too came out of their salary and not the owners!!The room was very clean and well presented. I paid extra for departure transport to the airport, which did not arrive, so a taxi was ordered but again took a long time which made us late for our flight. The staff were very friendly, but as part of my package we were supposed to get a massage but this did not eventuate. It was not offered and even after a request, it didn't eventuate. The most disturbing aspect was the pool. On arrival were were told that the pool pump was broken, my husband being a swimmer asked how long it had been broken. We were told 2 days but by day 5 the pump was still not fixed, we were wondering if new guests were being told that the pump had been broken for only 2 days. With the heat, this is NOT healthy.My feedback would be that although the staff more than make up for everything, the owner really does need to get his act together. Maintenance is definitely needed, and quickly to ensure that the hotel doesn't fall into more disrepair! The staff should also not be responsible for arranging to have repairs done and pay for the repairs out of their own pocket! This should be the owner's responsibility! I probably wouldn't stay here again, but definitely liked the location and area and would select another property on my next trip to Canguu!", "Date": "Nov 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR809976344", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BaliLoverForever"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294226-d662885-r22165456-Abian_Biu_Residence-Bali.html", "HotelID": "662885", "Price": "$201"}}
