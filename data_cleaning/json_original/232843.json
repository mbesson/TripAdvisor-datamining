Apparently, the Hotel Trevi attendent had parked the car illegally. On Feruary 20, we recieved an official citation from the Rome Police stating that we were being fined 101.41 Euro for \"driving in a limited traffic area without authorization.\" At no time was the car in our possession when the so-called violations occurred. Furthermore, we were never stopped by the police nor issued any citation while driving in or out of Rome. My only conclusion is that the Hotel Trevi and Hertz are complicit in committing fraud upon us for violations that occurred while the Hotel Trevi was in possession of our car. This sort of fraud is common throughout Italy (Google Traffic Fraud Italy) and can only happen with the complicity of hotels and rental car companies. Our experience with the Hotel Trevi was terrible and the staff was rude and unaccommodating. The breakfast meal was of inmate quality.

It was our first time in Rome, and we couldn't have a better first time!! We had a little problem finding the hotel because our taxidriver wasn't allowed to drop us in front of the hotel (one-way streets...), but thanks to a helpful waiter of a nearby restaurant we found it after a 10 minute walk. We were welcomed warmly and were told we had a room in another building. A bellboy and another employee accompanied us to the building. The bellboy immediately began a conversation with us about all the soccerteams he knew in Holland (we're from Amsterdam), very funny. When he showed us the dependance and the room we were stunned! The room was located in a beautiful old roman residence building nearby (less than 1 minute walk) . There was no security or reception, but the door only could only be opened with a code so it felt save. To get to the room we had to walk through a high marmer hall, our room was located on the first floor so we had to walk a small staircase, not a problem for us! The room itself was more like an appartment: a medium large hall, a small living room with a sink, mini-fridge, dishwasher and small cooking plate. Next to that room was the bathroom. It was small but sooooo beautiful and romantic and everything we needed was there: luxurious showerhead, toilet, bidet, gorgeous sink, hairdryer, mirror with cabinet behind it... To get to the bedroom we had to walk a small cute staircase, the bedroom itself was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. Only thing was that the ceiling wasn't very high in the doorways so we had to remember not to bump our heads. The appartment was furnished in antique style, very romantic like the bathroom. Throughout the appartment there was enough closetroom for the most heavy packed traveller. Every day our room was cleaned, bed made up and towels changed. We couldn't be more satisfied. The breakfast room at the top floor of the hotel was very small but very cosy, service was friendly and food was good. The location of the hotel is perfect, we walked everywhere! Even to Trastevere,Villa Borghese and Vatican City. I read reviews with complaints about not being in the hotelbuilding itself and about noise from the Trevi fountain area; we saw only benefits in being in a dependance because it was very quiet (no small hallways where people walk by the room throughout the night) and it felt like having your own appartment in Rome! We haven't experienced any noise at all from the Trevi fountain area (maybe because we were in the dependance...). I also read complaints about the employees but I can't say anything else than: excellent service!! We were reconized when we came at the reception room and it wasn't even necessary to say our room number: they already knew!! And when we used the internet to print our boarding passes we didn't get charged, very kind. So Trevi Hotel: thanks for the delightful stay!

Despite this we did not get the room we paid for as were advised that it was in fact a Suite not a Junior Suite yet in reception they display photos of it as a Superior room that you can upgrade to for an additional \u20ac30 per night so all rather confusing as the website shows the same room to be titled the Minerva Suite. Anyway we ended up with room 515 Spagna which we kept being assured was the junior suite, to be fair this room was very clean, cool and comfortable but did not have any lounge type space as you would expect of a suite or junior suite. It was in the building just to the side of the main hotel building so still perfect in terms of location. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful to us throughout our stay, we never found the roof top terrace that is pictured on the website showing an area you can relax in overlooking the rooftops of the city with a glass of wine after a lot of walking and were told that they only had the breakfast room up at the top with the panoramic windows and this was not accessible to guests after the breakfast session has finished so were a bit confused about this. We chose this hotel as thought by having the junior suite and the roof top terrace there would be areas in which we could relax without having to be in our room or out all day so this was a shame but we were out so much as there is so much to see and do in the fantastic city that Rome is that we decided not to dwell on this, it was just a bit annoying!

The bed is against the wall which is very uncomfortable. We left the window open to find Rome wakes up very early and in the narrow streets voices are very loud.

(how that would have helped I dont know) Having tramped through the Metro system going up and down stairs for no apparent reason other than to enduce heart attacks in travellers with 30kg suitcases I arrived at the Trevi. The hotel is located down an alleyway in the centre of the city a coin's throw from the Trevi Fountain. Behind the reception counter we found 'Franco' a hotel employee being very careful to explain to an American father and son duo on how to travel around Rome. He went into great detail to ensure there were no misunderstanding; this took around 15 minutes whilst I waited to check in. Finally Franco turned his attention to my 'glowing' partner and her sweating rhino that was me. Franco's attention to detail and customer service matched that of the previous guests and having past me a number of tissues to save dripping over his counter went on to explain that we were very lucky to have one of the best rooms the hotel had to offer. So special that is was not in this particular hotel! (sound familiar?) Franco dressed this situation up with great flair and passion that I soon believed that I was in fact very lucky. The porter took our luggage out of the hotel with us in tow. Right out the door, left into the street, across the cross roads and finally covering no more that a 60 second walk we arrived at a large residential green door. We were on the 5th floor and to get there an elevator would be needed. This ancient elevator held a maximum of two people and was snug to say the least. The porter had to load up the elevator and squeeze himself like a pipe cleaner into the remaining space. We travelled ahead to ensure sufficient oxygen was available in such a small space. The room was a small appartment and met our needs. It was clean, fairly recently decorated (within 2 years) and allowed a breeze to flow through the rooms due to its elevated position. Not bad. Breakfast was served on the 4th floor of the hotel next morning. Again a very small service elevator took us up to the 'roof terrace.' This experience can only be described as an accident waiting to happen. The breakfast area held approx 15 tables and was so small it was hard to tell where one table ended and another started. The coffee was disgusting! I mean, really bad. It was a cheap instant coffee which I can only assume is what the hotel think Dutch, German, American and British people like to drink in a group environment. Mass poisoning I would say. My advise would be not to have the breakfast when booking this hotel. Get something from one of the nearby cafes and free up some space in the very small terrace garden for someone less fortunate. I spoke with two very jolly British ladies who said there room was small it was rediculous. This seems to be another familiar theme. My advice is that if you need a clean place to lay your head for a reasonable price this is it. If you want luxury, go elsewhere and pay twice the room rate. One last note about the apartment; there are no Fire evacuation notices displayed that I could see. It was an old building with multi occupancy and therefore this carries risks. There are routes however you should find and walk them yourself.

We were not given one. Our room was small, dingy and the double bed was just two singles pushed together. When I said that our room was not like those advertised as 'Superior,' the man at the desk simply told me the pictures were of Suites. He was not telling the truth. We had been downgraded from Superior to a standard room with no refund as was evident by the rooms I viewed of friends I made while staying at the hotel. Judging by reviews on this site, the hotel appears to have a track record of failing to honour bookings. Instead, they house off site or simply downgrade with no refund. On the plus side, the location is good enough (there are many more in Rome that would be equally as good). The breakfast was also good, but there was no room to sit down. The negatives are many: we did not get the room we booked. No hot water in the shower if you rise later than 7:30, the hotel WiFi was not strong enough to reach our room and no refund was offered on the grounds we could sit in the lobby where WiFi is available. The lobby facilities are small and not comfortable, so extended work was not possible here. (There is no help with wireless connections: We were simply told 'No one else has problems connecting!') There are no irons, and no help getting shirts pressed externally or through the hotel service. For tourist purposes, this hotel is right around the corner from Trevi Fountain, but by personal preference I would pick other locations that would be more central. Fair enough, this is not a business hotel, but many other hotels in the area have a reliable internet (which is so necessary these days) that is free, and irons or some means of getting things pressed. I also felt the staff was dismissive rather than rude. There was no excuse for lying about our room being a 'Superior Room,' however and certainly none for collecting money for a service they did not provide. As an aside, the hotel staff warn you of pickpockets on public transport and steer you in the direction of a hop on - hop off bus company. Do not take this advice, the bus company Hotel Trevi recommends keeps its customers waiting at each stop for over an hour. There isn't time in Rome to bother with this. The public transport system is great, taking just standard precautions. The hop on hop off bus company to avoid is Ciao Roma. The Vatigan Tour that Trevi Hotel recommends should also be scruitinized carefully. The tour guide was lovely, but there are better sites in the Vatigan Museum than the Map Room and the tapestries. Do go with a company that leaves early, though! If you have time, shop around. If you do take the hotel's advice, don't bother rushing down from your 'early' breakfast....the tour company, Appian Way, will most likely keep you waiting to go, and come back, for over an hour.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel is a scam !!\u201d", "Author": "FWL1", "ReviewID": "UR57593549", "Content": "We, like many others who book this hotel, I arrived to be told there has been a 'mistake' and that the only room they have for us is in a sister hotel, 10 minutes away.

The electrical system in each room is controlled by a Key Card Switch, which turns on all electrical circuits in the room by inserting the room key once you access the room. We had to leave the key in the switch all day to have the room barely acconditioned at night when we returned. INTERNET ACCESS: I had to keep in touch with my office while I was away, therefore this was a requirement during my search. The hotel web site indicates that there is \"dial-up internet port\" in every room. That was NOT true. The hotel offers a very slow internet access in one little room next to the reception. The hotel is formed by very old residential buildings that have been adapted as a hotel. These buildings have been fitted Each with One very small elevators (can Barely fit One person with One suitcase in any of them), therefore be ready to go up Two to Four Stories carrying your suitcases.

Last comment, the front desk recommendations were always tied to them making money from their recommendations. For instance the \"Hop-on hop off\" busses, there were no need for reservations, since they run all day from stop to stop, and the hotel made an \"extra charge\" with the pretense of making a \"reservation\" which was absolutely not necessary and/or existant.

The hotel is as central as you can get and only fifty yards from the Trevi Fountain.

Definately well worth it especially if its your first time in Rome but don't go for all day ones with lunch - lunch is rubbish and not worth the money!!! Book the trips separate and find somewhere to lunch yourselves. 2. The taxi's from the airport are a fixed price of 30 Euros - if asking reception to book cab for your return trip to airport ensure they book the cabs with fixed rate of 30 Euros otherwise you'll get a chauffeur driven car costing 52 Euros!!!!! 3. Always remember to order potatoes, salad or veg with meal otherwise if you order steak, just steak is what you'll get!!!

The Hotel Trevi was clearly above average for its star raiting as Roman hotels are conserned. We got a spacious quadruple room in an other building (probably 17th century), close to the reception building - and the entrance was directly from the street.

The bathroom was modern and of good standard, even though the water pressure in the shower could have been better. Overall cleanliness was good. Aircon functioned satsfactorily and was fairly quiet.

Even though there were crowds of people in the area, very few entered this narrow back alley.

The breakfast room on the fourth floor of the main (reception) building was on the small side, with too many tables and chairs stuck in a small space - but we always found an empty table no matter what time we had our breakfast.

Even the emergency lighting didnt work after a while. Told the guy at reception who said he would sort it out for us and went out for the evening. Of course he didnt do anything about it and we just slept and decided to sort it out in the morning. The receptionists are pretty useless and patronising. The receptionist in the morning seemed keen to help and said she would send someone up while we had our breakfast. This wasnt the case but eventually a guy came over to the room and sorted it in about half an hour. Finally we also had problems with the key cards which seem to stop working every now and again. Loads of people seemed to be getting this and it is a bit of a pain when your room 4 flights up in a different building to the hotel. At least it was good exercise! Anyway, like i said before, it was a BRILLIANT holiday, Rome is amazing! If you are the sort of person that would get wound up by this sort of thing then dont stay at hotel trevi. We took all this stuff in our stride and didnt complain as everything was eventually sorted out and it really didnt effect our stay because we just got on with having fun. The location is great and i expect you could get lucky and not have any probs.

I have to be honest, I expected to be put up in the worst hotel for out first night but it was a lovely, 4 star hotel but right across town. We were then took back to the Hotel Trevi in the morning and there was a different receptionist on who said the maid's were just getting the room ready showing that there was no water problem and in fact, had overbooked the room! So we were lied too! Which wasnt very pleasent, I would of preferred the truth. The stay overall was nice and it was a good hotel to be based in as was only basic.

We however made what turned out to be the big mistake of prepaying, through our tour agent, for the rooms. Unfortunately, we didn't get to stay in the hotel on either of our two nights in Rome. We arrived to be told that 'they had problems', which meant of course they'd done the old trick of overbooking a central hotel, and then shipping you off to some other residence. After an age of arguments and wrangling, we eventually cut our losses and went to their alternative room, which was 'beautiful and close by' It was a twenty five minute taxi ride away, a windowless basement flat, in a private residence, in a side street, still covered in scaffolding, which would never have passed EU H & S requirements for a hotel room. The room has first class facilties, they said - it had none of the facilities you'd expect in a hotel room, it was a basically furnished private bedsit. We need 2 keys to the room. No problem we have given you 2 they said - they hadn't, just separate keys for the 3 metal grilles we had to unlock to get in ! Ring us to be picked up for breakfast, they said - not even a phone in the room ! Luckily we knew Rome, and had a spattering of Italian - if this had been a first time visit, for a less travel savvy person it could have completely ruined a weekend. We went back to the hotel to complain and found the front desk manned by someone else who helpfully told us 'this is your problem, not ours!' We decided to make the best of a bad job and enjoy the city that night. The next morning when we returned to the hotel, we refused point blank to return to the bedsit, and eventually after more arguing and wrangling got the offer of another 'apartment' much closer to the hotel. Given it's location - much closer to the original hotel - and it's facitlties - it at least had a phone, a mini bar, although it was still largely windowless - and the fact we didn't want to spend even more of our limited weekend arguing or finding somewhere else to stay, we took it. During our time at the check in and at the remote bedsit, we came across four other parties who had been overbooked, and switched - so this was no 'unusual' event !
