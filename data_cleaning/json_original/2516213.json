The only complaint is that the lounge is only open from 5 - 10 pm and the hotel itself sits, it seems, in the middle of no where. They do have a van shuttle until 3 pm if you need to go somewhere and don't want to drive. There is a small strip mall within walking distance.

This Courtyard seemed relatively new, so things were clean and organized. The internet seemed unusually slow and based on performance during the different time periods, I would guess that it was DSL.

I wish Courtyard would replace all their elevators - they must be the slowest in all hotel chains. Seems even the other Marriott properties have better ones. Overall, I'd recommend staying here.

After two days we decided to stay there despite a fourty minutes drive each day. Everything is just great at this hotel. It's new and the people just make this hotel a must stay. It is hard to judge an hotel on an overnight stay, but ten nights is more than enough to make a honest review. The rooms were spacious, clean and well designed. Modern yet well priced. A rare combination. All amenities are new. The bed was confortable. The proximity of several restaurants, movie theatre and shopping was a plus. Last but definitly not least was the outsdanding staff: Maria and Mike in the restaurant for breakfast were as good as it gets. Polite, smiling, helpful and a pleasure to have around. The lady at the bar was pleasant and knowledgeable. A gentleman at the front desk even called all the restaurants around to check for us which one would be open for thanksgiving. Nice touch.

Commute to downtown or the airport is about 20min. Lobby: Clean, new, perfect for casual business meetings all day long.

Local area: There's an outdoor retail mall about 20min walk plus movie theatres. 3-4 chain restaurants - were the usual fare. Red Robin, Chipotle, a couple of decent burger joints and a great Sushi place (not a chain). Cheap Golf at decent muni courses ( <$50 round) is about a 20min drive away. Popular eateries and nightlife in Glendale are 10min drive. Scottsdale is more upscale and better restaurants and nightlife - 35min drive. Rooms: Clean carpet, firm, comfortable mattress, down duvet, good, silent central heat/A/C, lighting was OK. pull-out couch and coffee table + small balcony w/ view of the back lot and highway. Room was a bit cramped for one would have been crowded with 2. 32\" flat screen TV had cable only + few local HD stations + HBO(not HD), Free wiFi worked without a hitch on my laptop and iPhone but needed to log in again whenever I had not used it for ~30min. Mini Fridge and coffee-maker in-room. No bathtub - shower only with water-saver shower head. Amenities: Had an outdoor pool, hot-tup + decent, clean excercise room . The Hot Tub wasn't hot the first day but they fixed that after reporting it at the front desk. Breakfast extra charge at $11/person was not that impressed, given the nightly rate was comparable to a 4-star. No airport shuttle and transit is not an option - car is needed. Parking was free. Casual business centre in the lobby was good for browsing, printing and even faxing - very handy and everything worked.

I had never been to Phoenix before and I was a bit hesitant about booking a hotel based on just research alone. I also do not know anyone out there , so I could not ask any friends or family members questions. I did do extensive research on a few travel sites and after 5 hours I finally booked this hotel. The price was affordable (other hotels in the area were over 200 bucks a night ) and it stated that this hotel was close to the ballpark. I was very happy when I first walked in. The front desk lady was very nice and the hotel lobby looked beautiful. I was even happier when I walked into my room overlooking the pool area. It was beautifully decorated and very cozy. There was a fridge in my room and also a couch. The next morning I checked out the pool and the workout area. BOTH were lovely and clean. I used both areas with a smile !!!!!! When I came back from the ballpark after my first game, the front desk had cookies available to guests and there also was a cocktail hour (which lasted from 6-10 I believe ). The next morning I had the breakfast buffet and it was yummy. The following evening I had dinner in the bar area and it was very good. I was able to use the computers in the lobby/business area. This was extremely helpful when I needed to print out my boarding pass for Southwest airlines. The best thing was that use of the computers and the printer was FREE !! The hotel was indeed very close to the ballpark and there was shopping nearby. There also was an In-n-out a few miles away !! I love their fries and burgers ... such a treat for a midwesterner !! It was also very close to the major freeways !! I give kudos to the management here. The place was extremely clean . The pool water was perfect. It had the proper amount of chlorine in it as it didn't smell too bad , nor make you feel that there was not enough in it. The hotel employees were also very FRIENDLY. If I had a question , it was promptly answered. I FELT so welcome HERE !!!! If I ever make a trip out to Phoenix again , I would LOVE to stay here again !!!

I had a King, and I could tell by the layout of the exterior, my room was a couple feet shorter than other rooms. I did have a loveseat/hideaway bed, which was nice to have. Free wireless internet, which was nice. I hate having to pay for that. The breakfast is NOT free. They have cook to order and continental, but even the con. is 6 bucks. A little pricey for what it was I thought. If you see a picture of the pool on their website--it looks big, and it is. Much larger than a typical hotel pool. Hardly anybody was ever in it. The hotel obviously caters to the business traveler, who probably isn't a big swimmer. My kids loved it, and the hot tub was nice and big too. Staff was very friendly. Never really used them that much, but always hellos when going by the front desk, and if I did ask anything, they were always nice-no surly attitudes. Had a better than average fitness center too. It was close to the freeways, easy to get to, and had a couple shopping centers close if you needed to pick anything up.
