My wife and I have stayed there for many years now, as long-stay guests and hope to be able to do this for many years in future. Having travelled my entire life to earn a living \"on the road\", it is easy to recognize the best, when it is the caliber of the Sunset Inn, with its exceptionally obliging, helpful and congenial staff- from top Management, to Housekeeping, to the Night Man. While Sunset's amenities omit pools or full-fledged spas, everything else imaginable (totally equipped full sized kitchens, great TV's, programming, free DVDs and players, free high speed wireless and wired Internet in every suite, Continental Breakfast, daily newspaper, etc.) is included in its rates. The unusually large suites are all upgraded, modern and clean. The location, right beside the The Davie Street Village, is second to none, One can walk anywhere to the attractions of Vancouver, whether it be Downtown, the waterfront, shopping, Stanley Park, Canada Place, Gas Town, Granville Island. the Casino, or the Sports Arenas. For those who don't care to walk, the city's superior public transit is only seconds away, out the front door. For those with a car, the hotel even includes free, secure parking! So, although I've likely shot myself in the foot, keep up the fantastic work Sunset, but please don't do it so well that there will be no room in the inn when we want one. We plan to be there as long and often as possible. Thanks for the great stay(s)!

I booked a one-bedroom executive suite based on the reviews, location, and price. The location of the Sunset Inn is great, as it is within walking distance to all kinds of shops and restaurants. Getting across the Burrard Bridge and to UBC was a breeze, which is exactly what I needed. With an executive suite, I was placed on the 10th floor and had great views of downtown and the mountains. The lay-out of the suite, which included a full kitchen, has an apartment vibe to it as you're provided with everything you need. The bed was very comfortable, although I'd hesitate to call this a one-bedroom suite given that the 'bedroom' did not have a door. The room was clean, and the Neutrogena toiletries provided were a great touch. Gated parking was included, which was very much appreciated in a city where parking is limited. The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful, and are a genuine asset to this hotel. Being in a north-facing suite, the room backed onto the alley behind Davie Street, which was loud and very visually unappealing. The windows did not seem to block out sound very well, and I could clearly hear all the alley noises even being on the 10th floor. I can't imagine what my stay might have been like had I been on a lower floor facing the alley. The bathroom is serviceable but very small. The suite is fully furnished and mostly well decorated, with the exception of the living room furniture which was dated and slightly uncomfortable. Overall, I enjoyed my stay here. I actually didn't realize that this was a two-star hotel, as I had booked based on the mostly positive reviews, and I would say that it exceeded what I might normally expect of a two-star hotel.

The walk is invigorating and the sights and sounds are marvellous. Most of the time, I walked. If you have never been to Vancouver before, know that this is very much a walking city. In the downtown core, you can easily walk to most locations. The subway can take you out of the downtown core to see other places of interest.

It is in a decent area with a short walk to Davie Street and all kinds of places to eat. I had a \"Standard Suite\" though I reserved a Studio Suite. They had upgraded me which was appreciated. I would assume this was due to the work going on re-cabling for HD TV and I think Internet. Pros Nice unit with separate bedroom, Bath, Kitchen, living room, most of the furniture is decent though, the couch was looking and feeling a bit dated. Overall it is better than a lot I have tried. The bed had a great mattress and I was tempted to pull the sheets off to find out what it was. The whole bed experience was Very good; Good size T.V, 32\"? Free parking (rare in Vancouver); Free \"Continental\" breakfast (all cold, toaster in the room, coffee was hot and surprisingly good). Cons Was not impressed with housekeeping, they changed one towel in the bathroom and pulled the sheets up on the bed. They didn't clean any counters, tables, etc. They also didn't vaucum any floors or carpets or replace glasses. Same glasses as I used the day before were still sitting out in the kitchen & bathroom the next day; Number of parking spots/stalls very limited and cramped; Breakfast is fairly limited and you have to bring your own dishes from your room; Internet is very slow, hopefully to be faster when the wiring is finished; No heavy curtains in the living room so privacy and sleeping in are difficult if sleeping on the sofa bed. Also hard to see the T.V. during the day depending on which side of the hotel you are on; I would rate my stay above Standard and below Very Good. I would recommend it and would stay there again.

The general areas are quite small and to be truthful, are ready for redecoration, but the suite was absolutely fine in all respects. The breakfast arrangements required that you went to the lobby to collect your requirements and take them back to the suite - not ideal, but the only option given the limited general space. It was interesting to see some of the night attire being paraded during collections! The Inn is located on a very quiet street (if such a thing exists in a large city) which was great except when we wanted to go out to eat; It was a bit of a trek unless you used a cab and being a little way out from the centre meant the closer establishments were quite widely separated.

Dave on reception made us feel welcome after our long journey from England and gave us useful advice on local shopping and eating and places to visit. Room 203 was next to a lift but we heard nothing from the lift and very little from the rest of the hotel - the noisiest thing was the fridge in the kitchen part of our apartment which was partitioned off from the rest of the room. The bed was large and comfortable, and the room large and clean with hardwood floors. Breakfast is provided buffet-style from the reception area and small trays are provided to take food back to your rooms. We found the combinations of cereals, croissants, fruit, tea and coffee to be more than acceptable (and there were muffins, bagels, bread, butter, jams etc too) Burnaby Street is a tree-lined residential street with well-maintained properties and a friendly atmosphere - around 5.30pm it is full of dog walkers and joggers. And nearby Davie Street has a wide range of shops and places to eat - the majority seemed to be privately owned rather than part of big chains. It has been described as a village and we can understand why. Granville Island is a short ferry ride away for those who like markets and arts and crafts, while we made use of the Big Bus which does 'hop on, hop off' circular tours and stops just around the corner. What of the negative comments described by others? While in reception we saw a group of cleaners and our room was spotless, so no problems for us. Yes, the decor was a little dated (eg CRT television rather than a flat screen) but fine for us. The view over the small (free) car park wasn't inspiring and we didn't make use of the small balcony - but that was because of the cloudy and rather windy weather. We didn't need air-conditioning but the heating worked well and there was instant hot water. And yes, the wi-fi signal did drop from time to time. The one snag for a truly budget traveller with a large suitcase is that you need to get here by taxi; at the time of our visit the van service from the airport wasn't running, and there is no space on buses for large suitcases. Ans this is essentially a self-service hotel - for example you collect your own breakfast from reception (and can cook your own meals if you want to do so) If you want to be waited on, go elsewhere!

In the first 15 minutes in the place we encountered a sign on the key slot for the garage saying its on its last legs and takes many swipes to work, a sign on the safe in the room saying its out of order, turn on a light switch and the switch falls out of the socket, tried to plug in computer and plug socked was broken. When we reported an apparent water leak in the laundry room, the response was that they already knew about it, and now that we reported it he was going to call someone to fix it. Why all this stuff can't be fixed when its noticed is beyond me. However, the rooms themselves seemed to be in good shape, and certainly seemed clean and bright. There is a free continental breakfast - very minimal - coffee, orange juice, croissants and bagels. Given all the great bakeries within a block, we never tried it. The kitchen in the room was very nice (think building was originally built as apartments, not a hotel), but very minimally equipped - 4 plates, 2 coffee cups, 2 wine glasses, a few pots and pans, coffee maker, some cutlery. The parking is about 10 spots inside, another 8 outside but in a locked gate, and a few other reserved that are in the alley.

The moment we stepped through the front door, I knew I was in for a treat, since the gentleman at the front desk greeted me by name and injected his informative spiel with witty humor. Our suite itself, on the 11th (top) floor, was both compact and spacious at the same time. Since the hotel is right near downtown, space is quite precious, but the Sunset is designed to use its space as efficiently as possible. We even had a fully-equipped kitchen/dining area and a balcony! There was an event nearby on the first night of our stay, and the Sunset was at or near full capacity, so parking was a bit of a problem--but it wasn't one that we had to deal with! As soon as we walked back into the lobby after trying to park our rental car in the hotel's lot or garage only to find that they were both full, a staff member immediately took our keys and found space for it in the garage himself (he may have had to move it later to let other cars out). The complimentary continental breakfast had a wide selection of both nutritious and indulgent foods (but mostly nutritious foods, including whole apples, cereal, and English muffins). The cozy fitness room had only three cardio machines (a treadmill, elliptical, and bicycle), as well as some free weights and a yoga ball, but I never had to wait to use the treadmill. There was no TV in the room, but the machines all faced windows that had a spectacular view of the charming, lush front garden and sidewalks, so I could do plenty of people (and dog!) watching while I worked out. The location itself is probably the best in Vancouver. The Sunset is one block away from Davie St, which has tons of excellent restaurants and shops. However, Burnaby St itself (the street the Sunset is on) is removed from the frenzy of that main street, and the surrounding buildings are all residential condominiums and apartments.

We were in town to participate in the Vancouver Marathon, and this was the perfect location for the race. We stayed in a suite on the 10th floor with a view of Sunset Beach and Vanier Park across False Creek. Our suite had a fully equipped kitchen (including pots, pans, dishes and utensils). There was a little dinette set seating four, a couch that was a pullout bed (fairly comfortable), a coffee table and TV/DVD player in the living room. The bedroom had a king sized bed which was comfortable, with plenty of closet space, a safe, and a flat screen TV as well. Awesome mountain and city views from the bedroom window. The windowless bathroom was small but adequate. The pluses: The guys (Elvis and this other guy whose name I forgot at the front desk were exceedingly helpful in assisting us with our plans for sightseeing, restaurant selection, directions etc. The location being close to the Davie Street gay village put is in close proximity to all the gay nightlife. Perfect for early morning runs along the beach. Having a full kitchen let us enjoy a few home cooked meals when the restaurants were getting tiresome. The continental breakfast served near the front desk was adequate (english muffins, cereal, juice, coffee, milk, fruit, bagels), but you have to bring your breakfast up to your room as there is no dining space in the lobby area. The tiny gym was equipped with some free weights, a treadmill and mats... minimalistic, but again, adequate for our needs. We could take umbrellas from the front desk for use on rainy days throughout our stay at no extra charge. The fax machine and computers were available for free use. Wifi in the hotel was also free and flawless. On race day, the starting point was a comfortable 2 km (less than 1.5 miles) away, which was a perfect warm up. The minuses: Not really much to complain about other than the housekeeping staff could tend to be a little noisy when they were in the area near the elevators (we could hear them through two sets of closed doors: the front door to the suite, and the closed bedroom door).

A supermarket and large drug store are within a block of the hotel. The bars are mostly gay, so if you are homophobic, you are in the wrong 'hood. That said, the Fountainhead is a very comfortable mixed pub in which you can have a pint and watch sports. And alternatives are within 2-3 blocks. Davie Street is, to me, far more eclectic than Robson Street. The Sunset Inn is a hidden oasis for someone like myself.

The gesture was definitely appreciated and they even moved our luggage up for us while we were out touring Granville Island. Front desk staff were great! We were dressed up in ridiculous Roughrider garb for the whole weekend and the jeering and jokes were awesome. Very helpful in recommending places to eat and arranging taxis.

It would be in the readers interest to book an apartment from the sixth floor upwards if you want some elavation over the surrounding neighbourhood. The easy access to the shops and frequent bus route makes staying here very convenient.

I therefore suggest you ask for a suite/studio which has a front view towards False Creek and Granville Island. My bedroom faced the rear. I was not not disturbed by any excessive noise. My apartment was of a very high quality. Everything is there for guests in the kitchen/bathroom/ lounge and bedrooms. I found the queen size bed very comfortable. The house keeping staff are often left out of reviews, I found their standard of work exceptional. The harmonious decor is really pleasing with pastel colours, some thought has been applied to the apartments. The staff are a credit to the Sunset Inn, nothing is too much trouble, they have a good knowledge of Vancouver and ready to assist at any time. I did have the opportunity to engage in conversation with 'Elvis', yes that is his name and 'Dave'. Both very charming and hospitable. In fact all the staff I encountered were most polite.

The hotel offers an extra good rate if room is booked and paid well in advance. A nice feature is to be able to print airline boarding passes at the front desk. Unit balconies are great too. While the interior of all rooms is equally presentable throughout the building, it's perhaps best to get a south facing room on the front of the building for better view and sunshine, but I believe they are more expensive, while the north facing rooms have some alley noise with garbage trucks and delivery trucks, but they are cheaper. One thing that I think is worth mentioning is that having stayed here over a period of quite a few years, I have observed that the front desk staff has not changed much, which in my opinion, is a fairly strong indication that the hotel is a good place for them to work and they are likely happy there.

Nice big mirror, granite countertop and big fluffy towels, all very clean as was the entire apartment. The lounge/dining area had plenty of space and we had a nice balcony too although the weather wasn't great so we didn't use it. Tons of closet space too. We made use of the washer and dryer downstairs which was a great plus, and the complimentary parking is a fantastic bonus- we appreciated being able to leave our car for a couple of hours after check out so we could go for brunch at nearby Twisted Fork- highly recommended. The only negative was that the main door to the apartment has a gap of about half an inch under it. Great for pushing a complimentary paper under, but also lets in all the noise of the people coming and going all night long in the next apartment. The second night we rolled up a spare blanket to use as a muffler under the door, and that seemed to block the noise. Our TV was also switched over during our stay and the new TV, although bigger, didn't have as good a picture as the first, and also had weird sound- it was either muffled or tinny and seemed to be missing the middle range.

Like the toilet, the one AC unit in the bedroom was barely functional. Fortunately, the heat wave in Vancouver did not hit until after we had checked out. The room we were given was on a low floor with no view and was surprisingly noisy from passing delivery trucks, despite the hotel being in a supposedly quiet residential neighborhood. The meager continental breakfast, which had to be brought up to one\u2019s room on trays, consisted of corn flakes, frosted cheerios, mini bagels (no cream cheese), English muffins (none on our second day), sliced bread, and artificial tasting croissants..

Excellent help at front desk upgraded us to a decent sized executive seventh floor suite with partial view of ocean. Secure parking at rear of hotel allowed us to leave our Lexus parked safe and without concern. Granite countertops, hardwood floors, Koehler taps, gourmet coffee maker, new high end and comfortable bed and pull-out couch. State of the art remote control, efficient and quiet heating/air-conditioning . Top notch materials from nice decor wallpaper to coating on balcony floor to rain shower head into large jacuzzi. We are a family of five, with three young girls and did not feel crowded, with a separate bedroom, family room and kitchen. What did I like best? Well, all of it. Cental location, the clean room, lots of towels and pillows and large flat screen Phillips TV that added with the smaller TV in the bedroom allowed for each generation to watch show of choice and in peace. Davie Street around the corner with tons of restaurants including the best one the Greek one midblock with the fast lineups every night...awesome meals and prices. We loved the three block walk to the seawall, strolling along million dollar ocean front condos and marina yaughts along with lots of joggers and cyclists.

Price was also good. Location, while out of main downtown area, was walkable to that area and since Vancouver is full of high-rise everything, a pleasant break. One of the nicest places of this type I have seen. Now, the problem. Told at check-in that of the 2 elevators, one was inoperable since it was being over-hauled. Therefore, elevator service would be slow. Fine. Shortly after check-in, remaining elevator ceased to function for 6 hours and then worked intermittently for next 6. Little info provided by desk other than to say that it was because \"Russians were fixing it\" - what in the world does that mean? Walked up 9 floors, did not go out to dinner because of elevator issue. Husband inquired as to possibility of moving next day if there still was an elevator problem. Assured we could and to check in AM. Next thing we knew, we were evicted in AM from our glorious room and forced into 2 regular second floor rooms and promised they would \"do something about the rate\". No amount of arguing that we wanted to stay (since by then elevator appeared to be working) helped. They stated they had \"sold our room\". I suggested they unsell it or put new guests in 2 second floor rooms for 1 night. They refused. Nor did they even offer to help us move our stuff.
