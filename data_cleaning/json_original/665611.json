Check them out, but I do not know about staying unless this is the best rate in town. I will pay more and get more next time. My rate was about $110 which was too high for this type of stay.

There was adequate heating, TV (although no English channels, but that\u2019s not their fault), safe deposit locker, free wi-fi and the bathrooms were clean. The location is great- just a five minute walk from Termini- we walked to all the sites in Rome and none of them were un-walkable from this place- in fact walking in Rome is a beautiful experience! The Colloseo is a five minute walk. The rooms were cleaned meticulously everyday. In fact, we used to leave the room a bit untidy and would come back after a long day to find the room spotlessly clean, our beds made to perfection, our cupboards and even our desk arranged. It was like coming back home every night. Whatever this place lacks in the absence of frills they make up by treating their guests like royals. They gave us detailed directions as well as suggestions regarding the routes to follow for sightseeing, the best time to visit sites, best places to enjoy a good meals, et. all. They even kept our luggage for the night for no extra cost when we went to visit Venice. The owners/ staff were the best that we came across in our trip to Europe- friendly, courteous and very reassuring which we really needed after our previous bad experience in Barcelona.

I actually hesitated to use the word \"service\" in the title, because that is something that is bought and paid for. The relationship here is more like visiting family or friends who are too busy to go out with you, but want you to have a really great time in a city they consider the best in the world (even if they stick you in a tiny bedroom up under the eaves of the house). I suspect I had the worst room in the house. It was a tiny little thing right next to the entry desk. There was surprisingly little noise from people going down the hall to their more spacious quarters, although I could occasionally hear voices from animated conversions at the reception desk. Otherwise, the worst room in the hotel had a comfortable bed, good lighting, satellite tv, reliable wifi, AC, and plenty of hot water in the shower. The power saving electronics controls in the key card were impressive. And I was treated every bit as well as the people in the high end rooms. The neighborhood is safe and interesting--day and evening. After long days of sightseeing, I was never interested in nightlife so I can't comment on that. There are many places for a sit down meal or take out within a block of the hotel. I went to the grocery store just up the block and got salami, cheese, pesto, bruschetta, tomatoes, and apples for my lunches during the day and even some dinners. I bought the local wine and even got a wine glass at the 99 cent store. And then there is the gelato store almost next door . . . When you arrive, be sure to use the directions they send you in the confirmation email. It is a European hotel on one floor of a building with many other tenants. There is no big sign outside, just an address number and a reception desk or even just a buzzer after hours. My rating is based on the quality of the lodging in relationship to the price I paid.

When arriving at reception the first time I was greeted by name, and although it was still before noon my room was ready. The room was a double (#24) at the back and it was always clean, quiet and in working order. We were provided more than a map of the city - we were shown the different areas to visit, places to eat and drink that locals use, the Metro stops closest to where we were going etc. We had the experience of being there during the \"riot\", and the staff showed concern for us and made sure we were always safe and steered away from dangerous areas. As the other reviews state, the hotel is close to the Metro, Termini, the Coloseum and Forum. The neighborhood was fine. The breakfast was fantastic, and as we had an early flight our last morning it was brought early, all you have to do is ask! We brought a bottle of wine to the room and asked for some glasses - we were provided with wine glasses and a corkscrew to open it with. The service is outstanding. We asked for a taxi to take us to the airport - all arranged. Wake up calls, no problem. Overall, it is a great small hotel in a large city with all the personal touches you could ask for - I will always stay here when in Rome, and recommend it to all my friends.

Easy walk to Colloseum (15 minutes), as well as to other tourist attractions. Also, for families with kids, keep in mind that the closest supermarket (opened until late) in less 10 minutes walk, but also there are a couple of good convenience stores in less than 30 meters from the place. Comfy bed, humangous breakfast (wait until you see the real stuff, we thought they serve coffee in cups - but they were actually MUGS... so just imagine the size of the breakfast). Pretty strong coffee - I had to ask them to water it for me... The rooms are located in an historic building, with has a lovely interior garden - and they are very well maintained (clean and neat). There is a very good and free WiFi connection - they seem to be on a broadband. Also, I needed to print a couple of pages, and they helped us with this - at no charge, of course. The staff is absolutely gorgeous - starting with Mirela, Andreea, George, Kumar and of course, Fabrizio - thanks all of you guys for the great advice and taking care of us. They gave us, based on what we had on our agenda, customised hints on what would be the best things to do (and the best places to eat AUTHENTIC, delicious Italian food - the ones that locals eat, at local prices), and the best routes to take. Also, they helped us with bypassing long waiting lines from Vatican, Colloseum by making the arragements - either by phone, or by e-mail, so we really spent our time visiting, rather than waiting. These guys are non intrusive, friendly and helpful. And they speak a lot of languages - we've heard Romanian, English, Spanish, French and of course Italian (could be possible more as we saw guests from all continents). We were travelling to Rome, in order to meet our daughter's Godmother family from New Zealand: they were visiting Europe, and stayed in the same place with us (@ Auditorium di Mecenate). Initially we booked for a double room, and when Fabrizio and Mirela realised that our rooms were 10 meters apart, they managed to upgrade our room (at no extra charge - switching us from a double to a triple) in such a way that our rooms were close to each other, and therefore we felt even more that our families were really reunited. A big hug and a loud THANK YOU for the Auditorium di Mecenate team, for this heartwarming gesture :) This is the first place (after staying in many 5* hotels & resorts, in Europe, Africa, Middle East, Asia, Australia) in which I wish to return to - and the main reason for which I have started to write on tripadvisor, as I can not stand when injustice is made, especially to the good guys (IMO, fellows rating this place anything less than 5*, are either waaay too picky or just have very very limited travel exposure to places which are situated in the heart of historic cities like Rome).

We were given two maps, one strictly for food since we both love to eat and the other was for attractions to see. We saw it all that evening, walking the whole way. The food recommendations was phenomenal. The hotel is comprised of 3 rooms. So you can expect to have some personal service as opposed to a large hotel. You do have to leave your card for security reasons. I requested to have a room with the ceiling painted, but I wasn't disappointed with my room at all. It had a large ceiling and everything I needed. The WIFI was a little finicky on my iphone. It took my husband a day to figure out how to connect properly. The breakfast was incredible.

Second, the location of the hotel was excellent. A convenient Metro stop on the A Line (Vittorio Emmanuel) was three minutes away and the area was riddled with restaurants and cafes (as was most of Rome I guess). The Colosseum was a ten minute walk and the majestic Santa Maria Maggiore patriarchal church was just around the corner. Termini station, central to all train, Metro and bus transportation, is a simple ten minute walk. Finally, the room itself (a double room - two twin beds pushed together) was certainly adequate. We stayed for over a week and the room more than met our needs. There was storage for clothes, a good shower and the room was very clean. Our window looked onto an inner courtyard with the clothes of the adjoining apartment dwellers blowing in the breeze - certainly added to the local ambience.

After researching different prices, reading different forums, and a few emails to some of the TripAdvisor folks in Rome I found out that 50 euro was pretty good for 3 people from the airport. It was worth it because of our all our luggage.

The manager explained to me that I probably showered during \"prime\" showering time so that might have been why. They couldn't do anything about that. I suggest bringing your own towels. The hotel towels are very thin and are basically larger sizes of a typical dining napkin towel. Overall, our stay there was fabulous.

The room itself was beautiful, clean and super comfortable. Breakfast was a lavish affair of croissants and toast with coffee. It got a little noisy in the morning as we were fairly close to reception, but that seems to be the norm for accommodations in Italy. The service was impeccable and I could not recommend this place more.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sackets Harbor, New York", "Title": "\u201cAuthentic feel of Rome\u201d", "Author": "merle7598", "ReviewID": "UR77684914", "Content": "This hotel was our favorite place we stayed in Italy. Location: Like the other reviewers say, the hotel is a bit hard to find (it would have been easier if we would have followed the directions on their website). It is located a few blocks from Termini station in the Asian district. Rite around the corner were several excellent restaurants, a small coffee bar next door, and a small market with all kinds of Italian delicacies (get the zucchini flowers, you won't be disappointed.) The historic district, Coliseum, Palatine Hill, Capitoline Museum, Roman Forum etc... can be reached by a long leisurely walk next to the Parco Di Triano. The metro is only a block away, allowing you to easily explore the rest of Rome. Room: The rooms were small by American standards, but very comfortable by European standards. They were clean, cozy, and air-conditioned. Service: Absolutely the best part of this hotel was the incredible staff. They were kind, patient, and always willing to help us on our journey. They recommended the best restaurants in Rome: Osteri Romana on Via Urbana (Also known as Osteria della Suburra\u200e), La Famiglia, 313 Cavour (wine bar), and others. They were very knowledgeable on shopping, sightseeing, local markets, and even helped us to learn to live the Italian way (which is the best part of being in Italy). Breakfast: Breakfast consisted of the typical Italian hotel continental breakfast of glazed croissants with several condiments, toasted bread, choice of coffee, and juice all served in bed.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SHANGHAI", "Title": "\u201cA very good hotel that give you home feeling\u201d", "Author": "zhangjing9456", "ReviewID": "UR74732222", "Content": "I arrive in hotel before check-in time, however,the room is ready and Antonella let me check-in and have a break, then Giorgio show me the map and mark where the best place is.

The management (Toni in particular) went out of their way to accommodate us and were most helpful in providing information about the city.

Watch out - the doorman/elevator guy is a little grouchy but other than that we loved our little place.

Since we were staying for 5 nights Antonella suggested we take it easy our first day and gave us a great walking tour to take, which highlighted many of Rome's most notable and famous sights!! Antonella also arranged for an additional tour with a local company to Naples and Pompeii, which was amazing as well, and it was a relief having a native Italian speaker making all of the arrangements! She also gave us great advice about staying safe in a foreign city! For my friend\u2019s birthday Antonella had a lovely flower arrangement waiting in our room when we got back from our tour of Naples and Pompeii! The hotel is conveniently located to the metro and not too bad of a walk to the Colosseum and other tourist attractions. Our room had a lovely, decorative, painted ceiling with three beds and a private bathroom. Breakfast was brought to our room every morning with juice, toast, croissants, and a hot beverage!
