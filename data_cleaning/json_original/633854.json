The location is very central for St Marks Square and for Rialto - both only a few minutes walk away. This meant that if we wished we could easily come back to our room during the day, which we did to get respite from the rain! The casa is small and compact and there is a feeling of the personal touch from the owners who run their inn with their guests interests at heart. The room (number 6) was clean and big enough for two although it had a very small wardrobe and no drawers. We had a small en suite bathroom with a shower. The room was serviced every day. We had no view from the room apart form the building across the narrow street but that was not an issue and were a quiet side of the building so really heard nothing from the street or anywhere else. I found the bed very comfortable and I slept very well. Breakfast was in a small but very quaint room which had a view over a canal an bridge outside. We sat by the window each day and enjoyed watching people coming and going up over the bridge. Breakfast kept me going well into the afternoon. We were given basket of pastries and toast with a range of jam, honey, cheese spread and nutella. There was always a special cake to take a slice of which I very much liked! Freshly hard boiled eggs (still warm) were on offer as were yoghurts and juice. A choice of tea, coffee and hot chocolate was available. The hosts were very welcoming and accommodating and wanted to make sure we had everything we needed. They offered good recommendations for places to go and visit and places to eat and took time to find out information for us about travel details. When we arrived I found the room chilly and could't get the radiator to work but after speaking to Valentina this was sorted out. Large umbrellas were available to borrow by the door and there was a great deal of information available to read about Venice in the way of books, magazines and leaflets. We were grateful for the large map we were given on arrival as the maps we had were quite small and it was hard to read them given the number of tiny streets and alleyways there are in Venice. We really enjoyed our stay and felt very welcome. We would definitely stay in Casa Petrarca when we next visit Venice and I will be recombining it to my friends. I felt that it was good value for money given that Venice is such an expensive place to stay and that it was so central.

On landing at San Marco by Alilaguna water bus (all helpful details provided by Valentina) - an hour's trip from the airport - we were able to find our way to Casa Petrarca very easily. One tip - don't take big luggage - too many steps up and down - we packed 5 days clothing into a small backpack and that was ideal. In the heat of summer you don't need much - but leave space for shopping! We had a twin share with bathroom - excellent.

We had 2 nights in the delux double room with the windows over the canal. It was really amazing. We had the opportunity to take our breakfast and eat it privately at the little table in the room overlooking the canal which was really special. For the 3rd night, that room was booked, but we were able to take another room at Casa Petrarca. My girlfriend and I were supposed to stay in a smaller room with bunks, but since another double opened up, the managers were nice enough to upgrade us to the double room with shared bathroom at the same original price!!! While not over the water or as large as the delux double which had its own bath, it was fine four our needs on the last night, and very cozy. And were thankful that we could maintain the romantic feel with a double room. For once in Venice, a tourist city for more than 400 years, we felt like we weren't trying to be \"nickle and dimed\" during our visit. In fact, the feeling was quite the opposite at Casa Petrarca, the managers helped us to mail postcards, gave excellent advise on restaurants, provided us breakfast in the room, etc. I really appreciated this friendly attitude, and would certainly recommend this place to anyone who wants a comfortable, beautiful, and romantic stay in Venice. The place also had free wireless internet for our laptop which was nice to have. Finally, the location really is perfect! Right on a canal, with the entrance off on a quiet little side street. You feel really secure and safe about the things in you room (need 3 keys- outside door, interior door, room door). It is also half way between 2 major areas of interest in Venice- the Rialto Bridge area and Piazza San Marco. We could easily walk to everywhere we wanted to see, and to those out of the way places where you could have the great experience of \"getting lost in Venice.\" To show that this is a totally unbiased review, I will give the single constructive criticism I have: We would have preferred if the shower in the delux room had higher water pressure (but bear in mind that I'm used high pressure shower heads, and a bit of a stickler about this when I'm vacation). It could certainly be acceptable for many people, and is probably more environmentally friendly. Overall, I am confident in saying that you will really enjoy your stay at Casa Petrarca!!!!

The breakfast is hot and lovely and although the hotel is small (only seven rooms I think) it has an air of calm about. Housed in a stunning old Venetian building with incredibly cheap prices, the owners are so kind and immediately offer all the assistance they can give, Get Stefano to reccommend dinner venues - we have never eaten so well!

Lovely breakfast room with some views of the canals, breakfast was included with the room price. The staff bent over backwards to help us, they booked tickets to the Venice Jazz Club (worth a look) over the phone for us which was really nice.

On leaving the car park we realised we had left our passports in Florence.... aggghhh. We called Valentina ( host & owner of Casa Petrarca which we had booked earlier that day) and she immediatley called the hotel in Florence to confirm they had our passports, had copies faxed to her so we could still stay in Venice and then gave us great advice on how to find her ( there was also a water ferry strike that day too!! ). Thankyou Valentina for making us feel so welcome, calming me on arrival after the passport debacle telling us all the local tips on how to have the best stay in Venice on such limited time ( had to go back to Florence the next day to get passports ) as our stay was cut short. Room was very clean and quiet and airconditioned and a peek view of the canals from our window, Beautiful city, great accomodation, very lovely host. Oh, and great coffee at breakfast!
