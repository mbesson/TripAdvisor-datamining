Overall our stay was very pleasant and staff was great. The room was well appointed and suited our needs perfectly. The glass bathroom door was a little odd, but overall the room was very nice (we were staying in the one-bedroom suite). The location was great and we were within walking distance from pretty much everything we were looking for. The biggest problem that we had with the hotel was the lack of a restaurant or room service. We have an 18 month old and at times she is a cranky pants and can't hold off sleep until after we eat. On one of the nights my husband had to sneak out (so we wouldn't wake her up) in order to go get food as there weren't any options at the hotel. The hotel does, however, have a decent breakfast buffet that was included in our room. The other big issue for us was finding a babysitter. I had been told that they hotel had a babysitting service that they used for guests. When I inquired about pricing we were told that it was 800HKD/hour! We weren't expecting anything cheap, but since the most we had paid at a hotel was 20 Euros/hour in Paris I was not expecting it to be that much. Due to the babysitter issue we weren't able to go out as we had hoped. C'est la vie! A minor note, but we found the pool to be VERY disappointing. Our daughter loves to swim, but the pool it TINY and situated between the buildings and looked dark and dank. It also was not heated so despite the 80 degree weather the pool was too cold for even my husband to brave. In the end we found the hotel to be quite nice and we really enjoyed our stay there.

Another was when we asked them if they knew of a travel agency where they spoke English. We were directed to the travel center in Kowloon with three floors of agencies. Yet we were hard pressed to find one that had material in English, let alone an agent who actually spoke English. Finally, I asked the front desk for assistance in making a collect call to the U.S. They called the telephone company to find out how, told me to wait in my room and they would let me know but they never did.

After calling back a third time, I was told that the manager was unwilling to allow the refund. I asked to speak with them, but was told the manager was in another meeting and could not / would not speak to me. The decision had been made. I then went on to inform them that between the prior call and this third call, I had been able reroute my trip to include a stay in Hong Kong for a date five nights out from my originally planned arrival date. I asked if, given that they would not allow a cancellation, would they at least move my reservation and apply it to that date. Without hesitation, I was told that the hotel would also be unwilling to accomodate that request.
