And now, after my stay, in October, I can confirm that it was an excellent choice. To put it in other words: all reviews I had read about this hotel turned out to be right. I had been in Istanbul in 2009 and I had already identified the area where I wanted to sleep next time I came. Fortunately the Sebnem Hotel is located in this area, very close to the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia, the Topkapi Palace and the Basilica Cistern. A little further away but still easy to reach by foot are -to the West- the Grand Bazaar, the \u00c3\u2021emberlita\u00c5\u0178 Turkish baths, the University of Istanbul and several mosques like the big S\u00c3\u00bcleymaniye Mosque; and to the North, i.e. down to the harbour, the G\u00c3\u00bclhane Park, the main train station (in one of its rooms, in the evening, it is possible to see a Sema ceremony with whirling Dervishes), the Hodjapasha Cultural Center (this is another place where it is possible to see a Sema ceremony with whirling Dervishes \u00e2\u20ac\u201cno pictures allowed), the Spice Bazaar, the Yeni Mosque and the Galata Bridge. In additon to all these tourist attractions, the small street of this hotel is very quiet because cars cannot drive through it. So the location is great (and obviously, there are many, many restaurants all around). With reference to the hotel, this is not a high building at all, as it has just a ground floor and two other floors. It does not have either many rooms (at least I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see many, just a handful), which means that the atmosphere is also quiet, relaxed and pleasant. The tiled floor of the common areas like reception, the stairs, the corridors and the breakfast terrace is very clean. The rooms are also very, very clean. Our room (I say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153our\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd because I came with my father) had a cosy wooden floor and everything was spotless. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll try to attach the pictures I took so that readers can see it. We found it very comfortable, well equipped, spacious enough and we enjoyed a very good sleep quality. About the view, well..., from our room (#16) we could only see the street but room #18 does have a partial view out to the Marmara Sea. However, if you climb to the partially glass covered roof terrace where breakfast is served, you will enjoy a good view over the sea. It is also here where they have a couple of laptops that guests can use for free to access internet (next to the reception they also have a PC with access to internet). Talking about the roof terrace let me mention that one of the reasons to choose this hotel was the good reports I read about the breakfast, a subject which I consider crucial. Happily for my stomach, the reports were right, as you can see in the 2 attached pictures of the breakfast buffet that my father took. Let me just add that together with the breakfast, they serve you a jug with a delicious mix of fruit juices which seems to be responsibility of a very polite man that prepares it and brings it to your table. By the way, the rest of the staff like Cesar, Serkan and the others (sorry for not remembering all names) were always very nice and very helpful. They are a great crew. And well..., these are my impressions which I hope will help other readers to choose a place to sleep. From my side I just hope to stay again some day at this cosy hotel (but not in October, as the weather was cloudy and rainy.

We were warmly welcomed by the staff & given complimentary Latte Coffees on arrival. Our room was clean & comfortable (I loved my comfy bed & the luxurious large pillows) - some reviews mention the rooms are on the small side, but when we were in Istanbul we didn't have much time to spend it in your room, so this didn't worry us - in fact we travelled for 5 wks through Europe/Turkey & we found the room to be larger than many... the Rooftop Terrace certainly is of a large size with indoor or outdoor seating & great views of the Bosphorus Sea. The Hotel has 4 laptops with free internet. Breakfast is served on the Rooftop Terrace - I felt the breakfast served was suitable for a King (or Queen!) Freshly squeezed juice was served each morning (to our table by Mr Mertin) , along with freshly brewed Latte's or Cappucino's. The staff on the Rooftop were amazing - always friendly & attentive. Sira is a fantastic cook - her delicious assortment of pastries & cakes tempted everyones tastebuds. Reception staff were always very helpful, with great knowledge of the City. We had a very enjoyable time at the Sebnem and I would definately stay here if I return.

It started well from the airport, since we reserved a car through the hotel to come and pick us up (25 euro, not a huge amount I must admit, although one can find cheaper transfers - taxi, bus shuttles or public transport, but we wanted to avoid any hassle). We didn't wait at all, the car was there on time. Moreover, since some of the streets of Sultanahmet were blocked because of the WRC rally, the drivers had an ingenious way of transferring us from one car to another in order to get us to the hotel. The room (one of the two with garden) was fairly sized (maybe a little bit small by western standards, but we didn't actually need more than that), very clean and tidy. It had a bookshelf full with guides in different languages (same goes for the entire hotel - lobby, terrace, one could find plenty of books and guides on Turkey/Istanbul) and in the small garden, which had mirrors all around to make it feel bigger, you had a comfortable couch with an exterior heater that you could turn on if the evening was too chilly. The TV was big enough and it had BBC news and CNN,which come in handy when you're stuck because of the ash cloud. Internet - one of the BIG pluses of this hotel - not only it had 3 laptops (one in the lobby and two on the terrace) available to the guests at any time, but it also offered free wi-fi throughout the hotel - when you have an iphone with you it's incredible - makes getting stuck not only comfortable but also much cheaper (thanks skype). Smiles - we've seen this is sort of the norm in Istanbul, but the staff at Sebnem always had a big smile and were ready to help. Same goes for the emails I exchanged with them when I reserved the hotel - very prompt and helpful. The terrace - I guess many hotels in Istanbul have it, but I doubt that you fell as comfy in all of them as you do on Sebnem's terrace. It has an open part and a closed part, both of which are very comfortable and pleasant - laptops, books, sea-views, comfy couches, heaters, wine (incredibly good Cappadocian wine), tea, beer - not to mention the fabulous home made breakfast that included a huge quantity of fresh juice. Ash-cloud - the staff at the hotel was very helpful with the \"crisis\" and helped by any means they could. We had only one extra-night (compared to other guests that had to stay longer), but we were able to keep the same room at the same price (we found out talking to other tourists that this wasn't necessarily the norm, other hotels raising the price for stranded people). Position in Istanbul - you cannot get much better than this - close to everything you need - monuments, shops, public transport (the tram which is a great way to get around is at ~7-10 min). Comments - a couple that I also made directly to the staff - the towels are changed everyday which is not necessarily eco-friendly and the combination of locks and keys (very big) is very noisy when opened or closed", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "rural Sussex", "Title": "\u201cFirst class haven during volcanic ash fiasco!\u201d", "Author": "mrsmatisse1", "ReviewID": "UR62262853", "Content": "This is a fab boutique hotel at a very modest price.

The roof terrace where breakfast was served had great views over to the other side of the sea of Marmara and in the evenings it was possible to sit up there and use the 2 laptops and have a beer or coffee. A backgammon set was supplied as well. The location is great for everywhere. The main tourist sights are only minutes away by foot. To reach Topkapi and Haghia Sofia just turn right at the top of the street and walk up the hill. Topkapi will be in front of you (get there around 10 to avoid crowds going in the harem and treasury). For the ferries just follow the tram lines down just past Topkapi, an easy 15 minutes walk and a great 1.5tl ride. Loads of restaurants within yards.

My mother and I stayed at the Sebnem for three nights in August and had a lovely stay. The hotel is located off a little side street in a happening section of the Sultanahmet neighborhood - conveniently located to all of Istanbul's most famed attractions. While at night not a few hundred yards away there is a bustling street filled with happening bars and restaurants that spill onto the charming street, the noise cannot be heard at the Sebnem, tucked away in its quiet nook. Also, we were never once disturbed by the call to prayer at early hours of the morning. Maybe because the windows weren't opened at that time, but unlike most hotel recs I've seen about Sultanahmet hotels, we NEVER were awoken by it (and I'm a LIGHT sleeper). The hotel is kept impeccably ....while there is no elevator, the staff rushes to help with your baggage (no matter how heavy or large). The room was fairly small - but what can you expect in Europe, esp with the size of our luggage? - and had beautiful hardwood floors, a new air conditioning unit, flatscreen television, and a small but perfectly fine bathroom. The shower was one of those Euro-style glass stalls and was small, but the modern double showerhead mounted on the wall blasted the best water pressure I've ever encountered in Europe...always hot water as well! The star of the hotel - aside from the most accomodating staff I've seen in a while- is its rooftop terrace. Traditional Turkish breakfast is included and is served by the family upstairs in a beautiful spread (i'm kicking myself for not taking a photo). Everything from deliciously fresh melon, to homemade cakes and borek, to delicious yogurt and watercress, to yummy olives, tomato and cheese. You could have yourself whatever hot beverage you'd like (they made a fabulous cup of capuccino) and sit outside enjoying a spectacular view of the Marmara Sea. The terrace was open at all hours for anyone who wanted to sit and relax...there were two laptops free of charge with free wi-fi for checking email (a computer was also availble for use downstairs by the front desk)...a bunch of hookah (nargile) water pipes for anyone who wanted to use, and Turksih music lightly playing in the background. Lite snacks and beverages were also available. All in all a terrific place to rest yourselves after a day of touring beautiful Istanbul. The hotel is literally a 5 minute walk from Topkapi Palace, Blue Mosque, Aya Sofia, Sultanahmet Park ....and about 7 mins from the metro (which I highly recommend using to get to places like the Spice Bazaar and other neighborhoods like Galata and Tunel). The metro tram system is above ground and one of the cleanest I've seen...and SUPER cheap (as are most things in Istanbul). Kudos to the Sebnem...I'll certainly be staying here again on my next trip to Turkey!

My only remark actually goes to a size of a room, but otherwise i would only have compliments. Room had all necessary amenities, including large LCD, hair dryer and drinkable water. Breakfast was served on a terrace, and it was excellent. Freshly pressed juice, good coffee with great choice (enough of everything!). We always sat there for an hour, as this breakfast with excellent view was a real treat. Terrace, both inside and outside is nicely decorated, and it was a pleasure to relax there during a rainy evening. Complimentary was use of notebooks, even wifi was available in our room. Staff was also very good, friendly and helpful. Did i mention that the cook makes excellent cakes for breakfast? This is not the cheapest option but certainly my first choice on next trip to Istanbul. The only reason why i didn't give five points to overall rating was due to the size of our room.", "Date": "May 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "ConsultantGAL68", "Title": "\u201cFriendly, comfortable, and ideal location to visit Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "ConsultantGAL68", "ReviewID": "UR29020334", "Content": "I recently had a chance to return to the Sebnem, this time with my wife.

My experience at the Sebnem hotel was not a positive one and I will not stay there again. On the positive side: As highlighted by other reviewers, the hotel's breakfast is excellent and its location is central. However, we encountered several problems during our stay: 1) As some other reviewers already noted, the hotel is noisy. The gentleman at the reception was talking loudly with family, friends who came over throughout the day and night, and the huge television in the main reception area was turned on all the time, well until after midnight. We could follow all television audio and conversations word-for-word from our room. This was annoying when we tried to sleep. I suspect the problem is not as bad for rooms that are not located near the reception area so please make sure you ask for a room that is as far away as possible from the reception when making a reservation at the Sebnem hotel! 2) We were charged more upon check-out than agreed on when we made our reservation. Before our arrival I called the hotel and negotiated a 10% discount (for paying in cash and staying five nights). The gentleman handling the checkout at the reception refused to apply the discount and took quite an intimidating posture. In the end, we paid up because we were in a hurry. We left, feeling really bad about the situation however. I understood the economic downturn is rough on the Sebnem hotel as well but its owner should realize that strong arming guests for small amounts of cash does not pay off in the long run. Moreover, although I understand that the never ending negotiating process is part of the local culture, I have stayed at plenty of Turkish hotels that are more straightforward (actually this is the first Turkish hotel where I encountered this problem). 3) There was an issue with the cleanliness of our room as room service did not clean the room every day during our stay. The reception did issue us new, clean towels upon request however. 4) It was very cold when we were visiting Istanbul so we were happy that the hotel's heating was working properly. The same cannot be said about the warm water however and at several occasions we had to contend ourselves with a cold shower. In short, we had a somewhat disappointing experience at the Sebnem hotel and recommend others to explore one of the many other hotels in the same street / neighborhood. If you do decide to stay at the Sebnem hotel, please 1) insist on a room far away from the reception area or bring earplugs, 2) if you stay for more than one night explicitly ask the reception to clean your room when you leave during the morning, and 3) leave plenty of time before your departure to 'settle' the bill.", "Date": "January 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guatemala", "Title": "\u201cGreat place in Sultanahmet\u201d", "Author": "DannyRoman", "ReviewID": "UR23132532", "Content": "I spent 10 days in Istanbul and I was looking for a good located hotel within walking distance from the principal sites.

From the hotel you can walk to Hagia Sofia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi, the Basilica Cisterna and Arasta Bazaar, which are top attractions. The tram station is in a walking distance (8 blocks aprox). A 15 mins walk to the Grand Bazaar and Spice Bazaar. The personel of the hotel were VERY kind. They were always willing to help with directions and suggestions.

The room have wooden plank floor, which is a little noisy but warm. The bed is firm but deliciously soft and the conforter was good, plenty of clean, white towels every day. The bathroom are perfect, the water pressure is more than enough and the toilet flush perfect. The breakfast is from 8 to 11 am, at the terrace, in winter is enclosed and heated. The food is abundant in pastries, cereal (just corn flakes), assorment of juices, fruits, cheeses, cold meats, fresh vegetables and coffe/tea. You can buy fresh squeezed fruit juices for 2 euros. At the lobby, there is a library of books about Istanbul, which you can read and get informed about the city. The rooms have no TV but wasnt necessary since one has so much to read and plan to do for the next day. Around the hotel you can find a lot of good restaurant for every day.

It is also only a short walk to the (efficient and very good value) public transport system (tram and metro, and a short tramride away \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ferries) which we can highly recommend that you use \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Istanbul is a very big city! The staff at the Sebnem are a delight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c charming and helpful, and a credit to the hotel, particularly Fatih \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a very pleasant, amiable young man and the epitome of charm. We agree with other comments on TA that the breakfast is pretty good too, served on the attractive roof terrace (which has a covered area in bad weather \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes, it DOES rain in Istanbul!). As with the rest of Istanbul, you have an attractive building next to a dilapidated one, and the position of the Sebnem is no different, but we would not say that this in any way detracted from the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location. The hotel is very simply furnished. What we had expected from the photos and indeed from most of the posts on TA, was that the rooms would be furnished better than they turned out to be \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in say, the Riad fashion. A room can be simply, but stylishly furnished but we have to be honest and say that the Sebnem rooms (and common areas) the furnishings are pretty rudimentary and basic, the lighting poor and to be frank \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the whole room is pretty bleak and tatty. (We could see that other rooms are similarly furnished when we glanced in when they were being cleaned). We stayed in the Garden Room (203), which was a further disappointment. The room itself is small and the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgarden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 is an outside patio at back of the room (and back of the hotel), with some seating. From this patio, the only view is of neighbouring hotels fire escapes. Two rooms share this patio, gaining access from a back door in the room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c being rooms 203 and 202. (This might prove a problem if the occupants of the neighbouring room decide to make use of the patio late at night.) Our bathroom was modern and clean, there was plenty of hot water and the towels were changed daily. However, most hotels provide shower gel and shampoo \u00e2\u20ac\u201c note the Sebnem only provides their guests with soap \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a tad stingy we thought! For location, the lovely roof terrace especially the staff - the hotel is great \u00e2\u20ac\u201c BUT \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6..We paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 per night (incl breakfast) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and we believe that to charge this price, the rooms need a thorough overhaul and upgrading.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "melbourne", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "cara38", "ReviewID": "UR21440640", "Content": "Having just returned from Istanbul I can recommend this perfect little Hotel as a place to stay.

The whole atmosphere of this hotel was relaxed and inviting, as there are no big groups of tourists milling about in the lobby as in other larger hotels. I was immediately treated like family here by the proprietors and enjoyed their company. My hardwood-floored room had plenty of character with a drape over the bed and wooden furnishings. There were no TVs in the rooms, which is a plus for me since I believe it contributes to the quiet of the hotel. Breakfast was generous and helped give me energy for a long day of sightseeing, and the view of the Bosporus from the terrace while eating breakfast is a great way to start the day.

I have to say that the bathroom was ultra modern with plenty of hot water which can be a challenge with Turkey's solar heating. The air conditioning worked well and was a must. My favorite thing was the hotels large rooftop terrace with a view of the sea. The breakfast was the best! We spent 25 days in Turkey and we had a lot to compare it to! Nothing came close! Every morning there were at least seven types of breads/cakes, + banana crepes (yummy), a meat/cheese section, veggies, fruit, nuts & on and on.. Something for everyone & lots of choices and variety. They served four different types of juices + coffee and tea. The best thing about it was that they served Turkish specialties such as borek, spinach pie, eggplant salad etc and so we had the chance to try many dishes without having to pay for them at a restaurant. We looked forward to seeing what they would cook up each day! The breakfast alone would cost 12 YTL + elsewhere. Also, the hotel is right around the corner from Cheers Bar and several others. The street is quaint & is lined with shops, bars and restaurants. It is a low key night life spot for the area. The point is that you don't have to go far to be able to sit in an outdoor cafe or pub, watch people and enjoy some nightlife at very reasonable prices which seems rare for Sultanahmet.

The breakfast was amazing and about 20 times better than any breakfast I have ever made for myself and the other guy on the terrace from Georgia whose name if I tried to spell - I know would be shameful, was incredibly polite and obviously very eager to help out all the guests and attend to their needs. The rooms had air conditioners, which was wonderful, and I am probably the pickiest person in the world when it comes to tidy hotel rooms and this hotel was VERY clean. Before I sleep in any bed I check the sheets and take a quick scan to make sure there are no bugs or weird things and this place probably had the cleanest sheets I have seen in a hotel in a very long time. The bathroom was spotless and they changed the garbage every day. Whoever cleaned our room even picked up my pyjamas off the floor and folded them - it was really sweet. It felt like at the end of a long day, we were coming home. In general, I give Hotel Sebnem a rave review. My brother and I both think that the man at the front desk and the man on the terrace deserve raises because they continuously work so hard, and the entire staff should be commended for their dedication and warmth into making that hotel a success.

Requests for services (e.g. shuttle transfers, directions, how to buy a ticket to the ferry) were handled without issue or problem. The property itself is in a no-through-traffic side street in Sultanahmet, just down the hill from the Four Seasons. This means easy walking distance to all of the Sultanahmet sites, plus we found it convenient to walk to Eminonu (ferry terminals, Galata bridge, Spice Bazaar) as well. The rooms are small but tidy, well-maintained, and good value for money in Sultanahmet. The bathroom in particular was quite modern, clean, and nicely appointed. All guests have full access to the terrace, which is a delightful spot overlooking the Sea of Marmara. There are also 3 notebooks for internet access, which we found very convenient, and the staff are almost always there to bring a cup of cay and a kind word of welcome.

More than one fellow resident found themselves wanting to extend their stay at Sebnem but unable to do so because there were no vacancies (this was high season, of course).", "Date": "August 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "nyc", "Title": "\u201cVery helpful staff, very good location\u201d", "Author": "philorock", "ReviewID": "UR18652457", "Content": "The title says it all. our room was a bit small, and lighting not so bright, but bed was very comfortable and shower was great. very nice location, a block from excellent restaurants and easy walk to topkapi palace and blue mosque. short tram ride to spice market and ferries. food was superb in rooftop garden with excellent view. staff couldn't be more helpful and accomodating. highly recommend.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cfriendly hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "OsloViking", "ReviewID": "UR17874894", "Content": "Excellent roof top panorama, I spent hours there relaxing, reading.

Things we enjoyed about the hotel: -First and foremost, the deck. The couches and chairs are extremely comfortable, and it was a great place to lounge around for a week. The view is of the sea only-- no momuments-- and while I didn't find it breathtaking per se it was certainly very calm and pretty. I did not see any slums as other commenters have noted. -The breakfast. Really, really wonderful-- fresh fruit (watermelon, fruit salad, kiwis, bananas, etc), a variety of cakes, several juices (not fresh, alas), and many salty foods as well (hardboiled eggs, cheeses, meats, etc). We always looked forward to breakfast, unlike in many hotels where it can be a rather disappointing or even disgusting start to the day. - The laid-back staff. They are not obsequious as other Istanbul hoteliers can be (\"Yes please! Come in!\") Helpful when asked, and always quick to take care of problems. -The furnishings in the room. Very simple and understated, but old-fashioned and elegant: four-poster canopy bed, framed engravings of old Istanbul, a little writing desk. -The location. Yes, most hotels are in Sultanhamet so it's not that special to be in walking distance of all the tourist sites. Sebnem, however, is located on a quiet sidestreet that, while only a stone's throw from the major artery of tourist bars and restaurants, remained very calm and peaceful. -The shower was very nice, very good pressure. -Two laptops were put out on the deck for communal use. The internet was often out of order, but it was still a nice touch. Things we didn't like so much: -As others have mentioned, there was an unpleasant smell in the bathroom. Someone said it smelled musty; I thought it was like rotten cabbage. Either way, yuck. -The bathroom was very small and had low lighting. -Things were looking a little worse for wear in the bedroom: there were holes in the sheets and canopy bed covering, the paint was chipped in places on the walls, our curtains fell down two or three times, the furniture was very scuffed up, and the bed coverings were threadbare and not very comfortable. -It would have been nice to have had a room service option during the day, although I'm glad there was no on-site restaurant (the deck was all to ourselves that way!) In short, I would definitely recommend this hotel and we had a really great stay in spite of a few nitpicky criticisms. In any other city (including all of the European capitals) I have never paid 90 euros a night but the Euro (or Lira) doesn't stretch very far in Istanbul and compared to other hotels it was in the same range. Anyway, it was worth the money for a stress-free stay.

It was situated in a quiet area, yet was within a 5 minute walk to the Blue Mosque, Aya Sophia and Topkapi Palace. It had a lovely rooftop terrace where an excellent breakfast was served overlooking the Bosphorus. On the terrace were 2 laptop computers with internet connection which were available for use free of charge 24 hours a day. The rooms were very nice, with modern bathrooms and were spotlessly clean. There were no TVs in the rooms, but this did not worry us as we don't travel overseas to watch TV. I would like to make a special mention of the man at the front desk. He was very friendly and helpful. He was always happy to give advice on things to see and how to get there and he even organised a lovely 3 day trip for us to Gallipoli, Troy and Ephesus, including travel, accommodation and guided tours.

The Sebnem Hotel is ideally located for a visit to Istanbul.

In fact we walked further afield and it's a good way of getting the feel of the city. As for the hotel itself, it is quite delightful. We travelled with my brother and his wife and had two rooms on the ground floor that had private access to a charming patio, complete with a profusion of plants, a small fountain and a bench to sit on. Both rooms had an exotic canopy above the bed which gave a very romantic feel to the rooms. The showers were brand new, with two swivelling shower heads, and on the adjacent wall a heated towel rail to dry both the towels and any washing. The rooms were beautifully serviced each day and it was a pleasure to come back to them. The entrance to the hotel is very inviting, with lots of plants outside, and inside a very 'Ottoman' look. The hotel staff could not have been more helpful, arranging our hotel in Ephesus, where we were heading after Istanbul, and car hire for the journey. The crowning glory of the hotel is the roof terrace where breakfast is served. This has a beautiful view of the Bosphorus and it was hard to drag ourselves away each morning to do any sight-seeing! Part of it is under cover for inclement weather, although happily we didn't have to make use of it. The breakfast is included in the room rate and is excellent. Having become accustomed to the typical Turkish breakfast of hard boiled eggs, tomatoes cucumbers, olives, cheese, bread, jam and honey on the southern coast of Turkey, we felt ourselves really pampered to have in addition lots of fresh fruit, breakfast cereal, yoghourt, several types of pastries both savoury and sweet, and for an extra 2 lira, pomegranate or orange juice freshly squeezed before your eyes.

Some positives: excellent location (very close to the Blue Mosque and the tram station), wonderful terrace with a gorgeous view and a good selection of items for breakfast. However, we didn't find that the rooms were anything special. The bathrooms were small (ever compared to places like NYC and London) and a bit dingy, and the rooms seemed a bit dated - certainly looked no where as charming as they appeared on the hotel's website. Nevertheless, given the price and location, I would recommend this hotel - just know that you get what you pay for. Oh 1 more note - it's not worth it to get a \"garden room\", the hotel doesn't actually have a garden, so I'd just stick with the regular rooms.", "Date": "October 16, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Amsterdam", "Title": "\u201cbeaut\u00c4\u00b1ful small hotel\u201d", "Author": "KimAmsterdam", "ReviewID": "UR10070850", "Content": "Hotel Sebnem \u00c4\u00b1s a wonderful place to stay: it has small but very tastefully furnished rooms, a breakfast roofterrace w\u00c4\u00b1th a superbe view on the sea, very friendly and helpfull owners and it is located in the old part of Istanbul.

Upon arrival on the day of our reservation (early in the morning) the man at the front desk stated he had \"upgraded\" our reservation to a hotel around the corner. I told him I didn't know anything about that hotel and I had booked the reservation there. He said he had no rooms available. I asked if he had rooms available when I made the reservations and he said yes. He didn't offer an apology or anything and never e-mailed me prior to our arrival to let us know he was overbooked. So not knowing where else to go, we followed him around the corner to the Star hotel. This was certainly not an upgrade and even cost less than the other hotel. There was no ocean view, the view was of some falling down building. The lady at the front desk was very nice but this was just not the hotel we booked. To top it all off, we saw at least 10 roaches in our room. We told the lady this and she said she would put down a roach trap, which I then noticed were in all of the hallways. Disgusting. I slept with the lights on because when we turned the lights off, they would come out. I would never recommend a hotel (Sebnem) that gives away a reservation and does not offer a suitable alternative. Even though I booked them far in advance, they did not even have the courtesy to e-mail me when they overbooked my room which would have given me the the option to find another hotel. As it was, we arrived and pretty much had to take the other hotel otherwise we would have been walking around in the heat trying to find some place else. I was really disappointed in the way they just gave our reservation away, never contacted us and booked us in an unsuitable alternative. I would never recommend this hotel or the Star Hotel.", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Sebnem", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d296014-Reviews-Hotel_Sebnem-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$46 - $105*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1 Adliye Sokak 52154</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Sultanahmet</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34400</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "296014", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/01/be/b7/06/hotel-sebnem-thumbnail.jpg"}}
