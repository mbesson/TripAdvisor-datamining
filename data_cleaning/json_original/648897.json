{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Far from the maddening crowd! This hotel sits on the eastern side of Chapultepec Park along Ave. Constituyentes. With English styling, overstuffed chairs and faux Chippendale everywhere, the air of style and civility in the services of the hotel are top class. The views from the avenue side of the hotel are of the parks green spaces and are just paces away for jogging or leisurely strolls. We enjoyed the area for being quiet ( the avenue side room windows are double paned for noise reduction), and for its charming streets. On the other side of the hotel is a remarkable small restaurant called El Jardin which has two lions and parrots, quite a novelty with very good spanish style cuisine. It's location means either cabs or walking towards the Condesa area, which is only 10 minutes, but for the cost of the room well worth it.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR315650974", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Mayauel"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d648897-r8487869-The_Green_Park_Hotel-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "648897", "Price": "$183"}}
