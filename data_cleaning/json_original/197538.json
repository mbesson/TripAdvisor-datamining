What is so advertised on the hotel website is just 2 cans of juice, 2 small bottles of water and coke - refilled every 3 days. However, it is still greatly appreciated, especially if you arrive after long journey. The free evening buffet is mostly breakfast leftovers, 2 extra salads, and some cake. Still it is fresh end excelent if you just want to grab something quick to eat. Comparing to hotel Rochester it was about 50 EUR per night cheaper- and was just a bit less elegant and posh, the choice for breakfast a bit smaller, but you get quite a lot free extras .

As a frequent traveler who has experienced my fair share of hotel stays, for both business and pleasure, I can say that, in many respects, this hotel just wasn't up to snuff. For starters, I was in Paris for a conference and, thus, required certain resources to work during my stay in the city. Though the hotel claims to offer \"free wireless internet connection\" in the rooms, this was not the case. Yes, it is free. What they failed to mention is that it doesn't actually connect you to the Internet; at least, not in a reliable way. Connectivity, for the entire duration of my stay, was limited, at best, and non-existent, at worst. Even the communal computer in the hotel lobby had a sporadic connection. After asking (every day for the full five days of my stay) for them to resolve this issue, by the time I checked out this morning, my concern still hadn't been addressed and no one really seemed to care. Don't advertise it if you don't really offer it. What is more, although my room (# 205) was well maintained and modern, the lack of a full-length mirror (with only a small mirror in the washroom) really put me off. It would have been nice to see what I looked like before attending my meetings but, alas, no such luck. There are no electrical outlets in the washroom, which meant that (without a mirror in the room itself) I resorted to blow drying my hair in front of the webcam on my laptop. Desperate times call for desperate measures... I might also add that the air conditioning in my room was questionable and the \"satellite television\" was only about ten channels, of which almost all were in French, with the exception of the BBC News. Not really my definition of satellite, but perhaps it is for some. It should also be noted that, while the hotel claims to be environmentally \"friendly\" and \"conservational\", I came back, at the end of each day, to a fully made-up room, only to find that all the lights (washroom included) had been left on. As far as I'm concerned, there is a contradiction between the hotel's environmental \"standards\", which are clearly displayed on lobby's television screen, and the reality that there is nothing \"conservational\" about leaving lights on all day. That being said, the facilities are (relatively) modern, the continental breakfast is nice, and the location is centrally located next to l'Arc de Triomphe and Les Champs Elysees.

For me location was the most important element. I wanted to be a short walking distance from the night clubs, the sites and the Champs Elysees. My next criteria was the value for my money. The hotel was well appointed, but not luxurious. I vacationed in Paris 20 years ago so I was prepared for the small elevators (max three people) and rooms, but pleasantly surprised with the space in my room. I've stayed is very small hotel rooms in Europe before (Copenhagen), and this room was more than adequate. My room was on the 4th floor overlookung a small portion of the street and facing other hotels rooms. However, in Paris in the summer the action is in the streets. You want to be outside mingling with people. In Paris if you get a room with a view that is a plus, but if not that does not subtract from the value of the hotel. The lighting in the main sleeping room was a little dark for my taste. I read some people made negative comments about the breakfast and the high tea snack. First, the breakfast was eggs, bacon, sausage, 4 types of cereal, yogurt, fresh fruit and fruit salads, coffee, tea, several types of fresh bread, 3 types of fruit juice and cheeses. If you need more for a standard hotel breakfast then you have a serious problem. Yes; it was the same every day, but so is my breakfast at home (oatmeal). Eating in Paris can be expensive unless you know to get off the main streets and eat at the small mom and pop type places on the side streets. You can get a good inexpensive meal at a little hole in the wall with bench seating. And save your cash for the big meal at a top restaurant and people watching on the Champs Elysees. The high tea snack is perfect to knock off your hunger from a day of siteseeing. There were fruit juices, sliced meats, prepared meats, rice and potato salads (very tasty), breads, coffee, tea, and cakes. It was on from 5:30 pm until 8:30 pm, and for several nights this was dinner for me. Yes; it was the same every night. But, I had extra money to spend on the other pleasures of Paris. And now to the staff! In my opinion the staff is the something extra that will bring me back when (not if) I visit Paris again. The staff was warm and attentive. All of the front office staff and waiters spoke excellent English. I was greeted each time I came into the hotel. The staff at breakfast would quickly fill the requests for items that were running low. On the night I was leaving (a 4:30 am wake up) the guests in the next room decided to have a late night party. I called the front desk at 1 am to get them to quiet down. They did , and I got a little sleep. When I came to the lobby at 6:10 am to wait for my pick up, it was too early for breakfast (7 am). The staff at the front desk left his post and had the breakfast staff prepare a full meal for me.

Cons: This is a solid 3-star tarted up to get a 4th one it does not merit. The continental breakfast was awful considering the stale, big-box store mini pastries served (shame!).

In fairness to the staff, when I complained (which I really don't like doing unless VERY disappointed), they transferred us to a nicer suite on the 7th floor which had a decent view out to Montmartre and the Sacre Couer.

Free soft drinks in the fridge was a nice touch, but given the heat, an extra bottle of water wouldn't have gone amiss, especially as we checked out before breakfast on our last morning! The included buffet breakfast was very good, scrambled eggs, ham and sausage, the ubiquitous pastries and croissants as well as cereal and yoghurts, good coffee and a good selection of teas.

The room service food probably comes from a nearby italian restaurant, because there is no 'restaurant' in this hotel (only a lounge and a breakfast room). Our room was clean, quiet and good sized. Perfectly adequate. The provided an infant cot as requested. Bed is VERY firm. Our main issue was with the hotel service. The staff were incredibly polite, BUT there were a few issues that were disappointing. When we arrived it was changeover on the front desk and we were asked to sit and wait for 10 minutes. After waiting about that long, we were told our room wouldn't be ready for at least an hour. It was about midday so not its not too surprising that the room wasn't ready yet, but a bit frustrating to wait to be greeted, only to be told that the room was not ready. I expect to be greeted straight away, and we would have left the bags and gone straight out to lunch, no waiting around. When our room was finally ready, we were told our bags would be sent up within 5 minutes. After waiting half an hour, we called downstairs and were told we would need to wait another half hour to get them. So finally, we went and got the bags ourselves. Its worth pointing out here that he elevators are small, so small that our infant pushchair had to be collapsed to get it inside. Seriously, it is about the size of a phone box. On the third day of our stay our room was never serviced/cleaned. When we said something at the front desk, the response was polite enough. By the time we got upstairs there were fresh towels in the room but the dirty ones were not removed. A bag of dirty linens was left in the hallway all night, on another night an iron/ironing board were in the hall. In spite of this, the overall standard of cleanliness in the room was adequate.

I was dreading it as had not enjoyed it two years earlier but had no choice as to where to stay. The superior room we had was a great improvement on the old fashioned room we had before as it was very stylish especially the black and white bathroom. I was very surprised that there was no soap as such in the bathroom, only in holders and if you are having a bath are not easily accessible. No other toiletries were provided either apart from tissues and I cannot remember having stayed in a hotel that did not provide that for years and I have stayed in some really basic places when travelling around . The worse thing about the htoel was the service. We were meeting people from another country and were told that they had already arrived . In the afternoon we asked to be put through to their room and were told they had not arrived yet! The first information was correct. The service at breakfast was non-existent. Plates were not cleared from tables even when tables were needed. No extra plates on the buffet table. The fruit salad had tough pieces of pineapple in it. You even had to write out your own docket for breakfast and when you did not do it immediately they were quite rude. The restaurant needs redecorating as well. In the evening we wanted to have a drink when we returned which was before 11 p.m. and were told that they were not serving anymore! The mini bar was not refilled with soft drinks so there was one apple juice, one orange juice, one still water, one fizzy water and a coke for two people! They did give you a free welcome drink which included a glass of champagne if you wanted it which was good and there was a free tea from 5.30 which was completely unnecessary. Some of our friends were in rooms that have not been renovated and they were pretty dire. This hotel needs far more staff to come anywhere near a 4 star hotel it is probably a 3 star at best. It was 199 Eur a night and to be honest was probably worth 150 max. They apparently have room service but not at weekends! I hate to think how long it would take.

I guess that is the only reason they can get away with charging what they do, as its pretty much a two star hotel by north american standards. It's in a very tourist friendly area, about a five minute walk from the Champs Elysee, ten minute walk to the Arc de Triomphe. If you're fit and have good walking shoes, the Eiffel tower is about an hour away. To get there, you pass the Grand and petit Palais, via the gorgeous Pont Alexander III (the famous bridge you see in so many photos of Paris), stroll along the seine and pass the Musee du Quay Branley, which was designed by Jean Nouvel. If you walk straight down to the end of the champs elysee, (30 min to an hour), there are some nice gardens, and beyond that is the Place de la Concorde (famous for the obelisk and being the site of the guillotine during the revolution), the Tuileries garden, and the Louvre. It's great that everything is within walking distance. Lots of great shops and restaurants along the champs elysee as well. The hotel itself was a mixed bag. The front desk was very friendly and everyone spoke impeccable English. They failed to pass on an important message (I arrived on a different flight than my husband. one desk clerk told my husband I hadn't checked into the room, when in fact I had two hours before, and he was quite worried). I think this was because they changed shifts. However, clerks were really helpful with answering all of our questions and were kind enough to store our laptops while we were out sightseeing (there is no safe in the room). There was also the bellhop whose name I forgot, who other reviewers mentioned, I only met him once but was impressed by his friendliness and he had a lot of good tourist tips as well. As others have mentioned, the old elevator is tiny and barely fits two people, or else one large person and their bag. If you weigh more than 350 pounds I'm not sure it would be comfortable. If you get a room by the elvator, you can hear it going at night. Room was small and had a view of a concrete wall! Furnishings were really dated and the bedspread was cheap looking polyester. Room was very clean however. they were very skimpy with the soap and toiletries, and I had to ask for more soap on two different days. This was very strange. Not sure if they are trying to be environmental or just cheap. I had left a reasonable tip on both days and figured the cleaner should have noticed the soap was a tiny sliver. the lobby is nice and there is internet but it's quite expensive. I think it was almost one euro per minute if not more. I was looking for an internet cafe and didn't see in the neighbourhood. The streets around the hotel are a bit confusing, as its an old neighbourhood and the streets are at odd angles to one another. to add further confusion, there are about five best western hotels within a five block radius of this hotel, and just across the street on the same block is another best western! My husband got lost the night he arrived because the outside sign on the side of our hotel was not lit up at night, whereas it was on the other hotels. I would suggest getting a map from the front desk, and being alert to the street names and landmarks on the first day or so. We spent an hour one night trying to find a particular restuarant in the neighbourhood, and by the time we found it, they had stopped serving dinner! this made us laugh. we got directions from a number of locals who tried to be helpful, most of them did not speak english, so it helps to speak some basic french. The neighbourhood is quite safe and there seem to be a lot of good bars, cafes and nightclubs nearby as well. There are lots of people walking around at midnight. Felt much safer than home. My only other complaint would be that there was a paucity of convenience stores in the area. Nor did I see a grocery store. Ended up getting bottled water from Starbucks on Rue de berri (they also serve freshly squeezed orange juice, yum!). There are little stands in the park e.g. le Jardin de champs elysee, that sell fruit, bottled water and crepes, and this is actually a little bit cheaper. Aovid the mini bar.... unless you want to pay 5 euros ($8 canadian) for a small bottle of juice. I might stay here again, but only because of the location.

An ironing board and iron were delivered within 4 minutes and taxis were waiting when requested. Yes, the two lifts are small, but how big do you want a lift to be? They work well and the stairs are always an option! Will definitely stay there on all my future Paris visits.

We got an excellent web rate of 70 euros per night per room excluding breakfast. We found the hotel easy to find after a short walk from CDG Etoile Metro . Having read some reviews I was pleasantly surprised. My standard room (225) contained a large double bed which was very clean , good storage space , mini bar , kettle and fresh decor. Importantly there was plenty of moving about space, not the notrious sideways shuffle as experienced in some Parisian hotels. Yes the lifts are of the small Parisian type but they work. The Bathroom was of adequate size to swing a hairbrush and had a clean bath fittings with shower . The hairdryer is one of those ghastly wall fitted hot pipe affairs so as recommended take your own. My room overlooked the back of the hotel out onto some unused land and was very quiet which enabled me to leave the double glazed window open. My friends room contained two good sized twin beds and was again of same dimensions. There is a good lounge bar area but because of the hotels location there is access to plenty of eating and drinking places from the hotel. Literally a few doors up from the hotel is a patisserie with a small cafeteria called Do Re Me that serves excellent coffee and pastries which is a lot cheaper than spending 20 euros on breakfast in the hotel.They also have a brasserie nearby . All in all I was very happy with this hotel , the staff were very friendly and helpful and I would stay here again.", "Date": "November 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cNo problems - very pleasant staff\u201d", "Author": "Loll", "ReviewID": "UR5412679", "Content": "BW Etoile Saint Honore. . . .it's a Paris hotel, so you get the typically quirky lifts and windy stairs etc. My room was an average hotel room - clean, functional, not luxurious but perfectly adequate. I was staying on business and it met all my requirements. The bar area is nice for a drink before setting out to select a restaurant for dinner - there are plenty a short walk away. There is no restaurant in the hotel although they do offer a limited room service. Breakfast is OK - expensive for what it is, but if you're not sure when you will be able to grab a meal later in the day it will do the job. It's a nice area - I walked back to the hotel on my own at 1.00am and didn't feel in any way concerned (and I am a woman). Hairdryers are useless - so bring your own, and there is no iron and ironing board as standard in your room - but I'm sure if I have needed one they would have provided this. The staff are what made this hotel stand out - they were so friendly and helpful I almost thought I was in the wrong city!
