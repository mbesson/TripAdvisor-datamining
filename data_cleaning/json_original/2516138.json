Great AC, very comfy beds, and VERY VERY good strong water pressure. The staff is very friendly and willing to help in any way they can. From the service stand point, it is that of a four star hotel.

I travel quite extensively due to my job and I am a Gold Prioirity Rewards member. One of the perks of being a Gold Member is upgrading. I requested an upgrade which was not even acknowledged with no explanation as to why it was not available. My husband, who was with me at the time, is disabled and needs a bath tub to bathe in. When we checked into the room and I started to prepare to give him a bath, I discovered that the tub was damaged at the bottom and it would be rather uncomfortable for my husband to sit in. I went to the front fesk and advised of the damaged tub and the gentleman at the front desk advised that he had no rooms available. The hotel was not even crowded what so ever. I knew that there was no way that it full. Finally, the man advised that he would call his supervisor and see if he could move me to one of the rooms that were empty but taken off the available list. I then asked him where the laundry facilities were and he stated that the hotel did not have one on premises so I asked where a nearby laundromat was. He stated that he would find out and when he called to advise me of what his supervisor said he would give me the location of a laundromat. I went back upstairs and waited for over an hour with no phone call. I called the front desk and was advised that that associate had left for the night and had not said a word about the issue with the tub. The associate said that he would send keys up so that we could move, which he did. After repacking, moving to the new roome cart ,and unpacking, we went downstairs to return the luggage cart and the keys from the priginal room. We asked the associate then where the nearest laundromat was and to our amazement, he stated tyat there was one on the 4th floor!!! I was livid and advised that the other associate had told us that there was not one. I asked for quarters and laundry soap and just as the guy reaches under t he counter to hand me a boix of soap he tries to make excuses that the prior associate had only been employed for 30 days and probably did not know that there was a laundry room on premises. If there was laundry soap under the counter, what would that associate think the laundry soap was for??? By this time, we are looking at three and a half hours of messing with these people. By t he time I got my husband bathed and got my laundry done and got to bed, it was after 1:30 a.m. I had to be up by 6:00 a.m. To make matter worse, I got the general managers name and number and when I contacted her and told her my experience, she said she would look into it and call me back. I never heard back from her. I ca lled her again and she acted as if she did not know what I was talking about and was extremely rude. I advised her that I wanted my points back or something for my compensation. She refused me and acted as if I had nothing to complain about. I asked for her supervisor's information and she told me that she was the head honcho. To make sure that I understood her correctly, I said, \"so your the head of Holiday Inn huh?\" to which she said yes she was.

I like it much more than the Best Western on Sepulveda, that's for sure. The HIE has a refrigerator in the room, which I consider a huge plus. I bought juice at the nearby Wal-Mart, for instance, and did not have to float it in the ice bucket to get it cold. As others have noted, the bathrooms are absurdly small, with long toilets that make getting at the hair dryer a feat for an orangutan. A shorter, rounder, toilet would have been a better idea! Another minus is the very loud HVAC unit. I found the beds too soft, and the fluffy mattress top was suffocating. Pillows are marked Soft and Firm, and there are fat ones and normal ones - great to have a variety. The free wireless was reliable and excellent, which is my main criterion when I am in Van Nuys, since I rely on it to do the things I've come to do while there. I used the hotel fax as my printer! A desk chair would be nice, though - I had to pile pillows on the upholstered chair to sit at the desk. I didn't remember that from two years ago, so maybe some rooms do have desk chairs. The hotel is just plain ordinary accommodations. The breakfast is just plain ordinary cold food -cold cereal, fruit, juice, hard boiled eggs, and bread for toasting as well as danish and croissants - think packaged baked goods, not scrumptious.

The breakfast selection was decent but overall this was not a good experience; we will never stay there again nor recommend it.", "Date": "July 31, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ypsilanti", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel-Under Renovation\u201d", "Author": "YpsiKev", "ReviewID": "UR5410881", "Content": "Chose HI Express as it was the closest to where I needed to be in the SF Valley. Stayed for 4 nights. Staff friendly, check in was easy. Originally staying in room 502. This room was recently renovated with new paint, carpet, A/C unit. It had the new bedding as well. However, this room had absolutely the smallest bathroom I'd ever seen! The layout of the bath is such, that I hate to say it, but an overweight guest I would think would have problems sitting down on this toilet. You cannot stand in front of the toilet to use the sink (no room), you have to stand to the side. I know you don't go on vacation and spend it in the bathroom, but just FYI. However, be aware that room renovations are in progress 10:30am-5:30PM everyday. I had to ask for a new room, as I was trying to take a nap (jet lag) and couldn't handle the pounding and jackhammering going on above me. I put up with it for 2 days, then asked to switch rooms. The staff was very accomodating, and switched me to room 321 w/o complaint. This room was great, also renovated....and a much larger bathroom. Internet access was wireless and worked fine. They also have pay per minute computers in the lobby for internet access. Breakfast was fine. Didn't use the pool. Fitness room small, but has TV and 3 pieces of new equipment (treadmill, bike, ellipical). This will be an even better hotel once renovations are completed. If you are staying in upcoming weeks or months (however long it takes to finish renovations) I would ask very pointed questions to the staff if the renovations are complete, if not, be sure to get a room on the opposite side of the building. Area is OK (right by the 405), didn't see any safety issues while I was there (even coming in late).....there was a security guard at night. Just use common sense like you would anywhere else. Overall very pleased, will stay again.", "Date": "June 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, AZ", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "UOT", "ReviewID": "UR4049959", "Content": "We stayed here for 3 nights in October. We flew into the Burbank Airport and wanted a hotel that was nearby. We went to the King Tut exhibit at the museum (I highly recommend this!), Six Flags Magic Mountain, and drove the highway from Santa Monica to Malibu. The traffic really can be an eye opener...there was traffic backed up at 5pm on a Saturday. We did eat at the Reel Inn on the Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu...I highly recommend this also, it was a great place for fresh fish! Check-in was a breeze at the hotel...we were in room 614 with one King bed. It was exactly like the pictures previously posted but instead of the second bed, we had a large chair and side table. We were happy with the fridge and the size of the room. The bathroom is a one person bathroom but that is ok. There were undergoing major renovations...looked like they were replacing all the carpet, repainting, etc. The room was very clean. The breakfast was the typical continental breakfast with the addition of warm cinnamon rolls. Very good...there is the Denny's and Taco Bell right next door. We did not use the pool...had pretty gloomy days when we were there. They did have computers in the lobby where you could access the internet for 10min/$1 but we could not get either of the computers to connect. I am a member of their priority club and booked online thru them for $80 a night. We received a copy of the LA Times every morning...including the Sunday paper. Some rooms had the LA Times and others had USA today outside the door. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking in the area.", "Date": "October 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mount Kisco, New York", "Title": "\u201cExceeded Expectations\u201d", "Author": "Fussbudget07", "ReviewID": "UR3942213", "Content": "My husband and I picked this inn because it was the closest place to our just-relocated kids' house, and because Trip Advisor had given it a superior review despite its 2-star category.

The Holiday Inn Express rated about the middle of the pack out of the hotels we stayed at. We selected this location because it was very convenient for us, as we were visiting relatives who only lived a few blocks away. For three adults, the AAA Rate was $101.47, including taxes. The non-smoking room on the seventh (top) floor was large, and included two beds, a clock radio, two comfy chairs, a table, a large television (could only watch fourteen channels) with remote, a medium-sized refrigerator, a coffeemaker, and an iron and ironing board. The bathroom included a hairdryer, shampoo, lotion, a shower cap, and soap in a dish. The sink was in the bathroom and the shower/bathtub had a handrail and a bathmat. While the toilet was hard to flush, it did have good suction, but seemed to be in the way when using the sink (since the bathroom was small). There were two elevators for this seven-storey hotel, and we never had to wait long no matter if we were in the lobby or on the seventh floor. If you forgot your laptop, they had two Internet access terminals in the lobby for a reasonable fee ($1.00 = ten minutes). Unfortunately, they were quite busy during the whole four nights my family was visiting, but I did managed to use them just the same. The hotel is located off the freeway and is within walking distance to Denny\u2019s, Burger King, and Taco Bell. You will also find that parking is at a bit of a premium, but if you are a Priority Club member, there are a number of spaces right by the door, which I took full advantage of! Overall, we were very pleased with our stay, as the room was clean, comfortable, and quiet. You might find fault with the small bathroom and lack of television channels, but these are minor inconveniences.
