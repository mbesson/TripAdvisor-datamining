The reviews I had seen of the Marina Bay put me off as there were regular complaints about it not being ready to be open. I could not be happier with my choice, from the warm welcome to the wonderful room. Check in was a breeze and we were led to our room by a porter who was too polite to accept a tip! My kind of person! We paid a little extra for a room upgrade and stayed in a business suite. Everything in the room could be operated by buttons next to the bed - I did not get bored of opening and closing the curtains at the push of a button! Our room upgrade allowed us access to the bar I think on the 22nd floor, excellent views from there. The lobby could best be described as cavernous with plenty of people nearby should you require any assistance. The location of the hotel was my only gripe. It is just a five minute walk to Orchard Road which is great but found that it was a bit of a distance to anywhere else. Although, with that being said, Singapore is a pretty small place.

We found this to be a perfect choice. The Shangri--La is a beautiful hotel with helpful, courteous staff and rates among some of the better hotels we have stayed in over the years. From the friendly check-in, hot tea and fresh fruit on arrival to the high level of service this hotel fully deserves its 5 star rating. Our room was a good size and spotless with a large, comfortable bed and spacious bathroom. During our stay there was building work going on as the Garden wing is currently undergoing a major refurbishment. This made the pool area rather noisy during the day but the work was cordoned off and the pool staff worked hard to keep the pool area clean and safe. Whilst we were there guests had full use of the pool. We opted to have breakfast in 'The Line' buffet restaurant each morning but prices are high so expect to pay around \u00a320 per head for a continental breakfast. There is a huge choice of different types of breakfast but some options could work out quite expensive for a family of 4. Getting out and about in Singapore is easy. Take the tourist bus from the hotel to Sentosa Island (basically a large theme park) for the day. The bus is free if you show the driver your disembarkation card from the airport when you arrived and also your passport. You can also catch the yellow Hop On Hop Off buses which will only cost $6 if you show the driver your Flight ticket. The bus runs every 20 minutes and you catch it on Orchard Road. It passes all the places of interest including Raffles, Boat Quay in the business district and lined with old fashioned restaurants, and Chinatown. On the way back stop off at the Botanical Gardens and see the Orchid House..well worth a visit. Orchard Road is only a 15 minute walk from the hotel and is lined with designer shops, huge shopping malls, restaurants and bars, and tons of traffic! But if you want to get away from the bustle for a couple of hours go to Dan Ryan's Pub on Tanglin Road next to the Tudor Court Shopping Centre for a pub atmosphere and food served in huge portions. The walk from the hotel will only take about 15 to 20 minutes. Singapore's weather is hot and humid with regular thunderstorms which are usually short and sharp. The humidity tends to be at its worst early evening or just after a storm but everywhere is air conditioned so you can easilly get quick relief from it. Singapore is a place I have always wanted to visit and I was not disappointed. However, a week spent there was too long and with hindsight I would have preferred to have spent more time in Australia and only 3 or 4 days in Singapore. But would I go again? Well for a short stopover destination..most definately. Would I choose the Shangri-La again?

We arrived with reservations for two rooms in the Tower Wing for non-smoking rooms made months in advance. You can imagine how we felt when we were escorted to our room on a smoking floor. As soon as I stepped out of the elevator I could smell it reeking. So we went back down to the lobby to be told they had nothing else for that night. We had to grin and bear the stench. We were not happy campers. However, the next day we were sought out by Duty Manager Julian Wiederholz who with profuse apologies changed our rooms not to another room in the Tower Wing but to the ultra-luxurious Valley Wing which is a separate building with its own entrance, lobby, frontdesk, concierge and restaurant. All of this was done free of charge even though rooms in the Valley Wing go for more than twice the price of a room in the Tower Wing. And Mr. Wiederholz included free breakfast every morning of our one week stay. Rooms in The Valley Wing are huge and provide every amenity one could possibly want. Many thanks to Mr. Wiederholz for making what started out as a rocky stay a superb stay. The Shang, living up to its reputation all over the world, is a superb urban resort with beautifully landscaped grounds and a lovely pool for relaxing. The hotel lobbies both for The Valley Wing and The Tower Wing are gorgeous. The Shang is located about three block from Orchard Road, the main shopping street in Singapore. The hotel provides free shuttle service to Orchard Road.

However it was worth EVERY penny. The room although a little dated and needing a few modern lines was absolutely massive, some 72sqm. It is quite rare to find such a large sized room in Singapore especially in the older hotels (the Shangri-la isn't exactly new - although sometimes its hard to tell). There was a study desk, two and a half seater lounge, 2 single sofa chairs, a desk, large minibar, what looked like a foyer to the walkin wardrobe, king sized bed and what was the largest bathroom I have ever seen in a hotel - massive shower, seperate bath with a marble dance floor to the sink/basin. To top it off the hotel offers L'occitane bath products in the room which help you smell absolutely devine in the sweltering humidity of Singapore. The Shangri-la is a resort even though most people may think of it as a ritzy business hotel. I guess this is why it blows so many people away - It really is like you've escaped the busy city and entered a tranquil paradise, as cliche as it sounds - but it isn't a stiff upperlip Hitlon. From the moment you step out of the taxi you are met by a fleet of friendly staff waiting to help carry your bags, open the door for you, to simply say hi or to escort you to check-in and all sporting that elusive smile that some hotels forget put us all at ease. The entrance foyer is huge and very grand with its check in desks, sunken cocktail/reception lounge, large staircase, 1st floor lounge and conference rooms all visible as you step through the front doors - and just incase you needed more attention or got past the front doors without getting noticed there are more staff dotted behind the front doors who politely nod or attend to your needs as required. This service never ends during your stay at the Shangri-la, be it from the house keepers, front desk staff, concierge, lift attendants or waitresses - they never seem to be too busy or important to smile, bid you good day or offer assistance if you look perplexed or lost. Even the lifts do their bit to remind you what day of the week it is as the carpets are changed daily and announces the name of the day, SATURDAY! Following on from the oppulent entry the ground floors are dotted with little extras that just remind you that even though it seems like you are in a small boutique hotel with servants at your beckon call, you really are in a large resort. There is an inhouse cake shop to make that special cake for you if you deside to have a wedding in a conference room or celebrate that special occassion - we recieve a 'congratulations on your honeymoon' cake which was waiting in our room, it was not requested nor expected but tasted even better because we hadn't. There is a tailor, gift shop, hair dresser, a rather large gym, beautician and what seems to be a theme in the Shangri-la hotels I've stayed in - Possibly the biggest and best buffet you have ever experienced, yes it is expensive but well worth the experience and culinary journey. One of the biggest draw cards for us as honeymooners before we considered any of the above was the pool and private gardens. The Shangri-la has one of Singapore's biggest pools and because the hotel is frequented by so many business people that meant that there wasn't many people around to enjoy it. The Shangri-La is set back from the busy Orchard Road, but it is a quick 5 minute stroll to the first shop or a quick taxi hop to Clarke Quay or Marina Bay. You'll notice that Singapore has something very right in that it is one of the rare cities in the world were you can sit in a taxi for 30 mins and only spend $15. Everyone says that quality and service comes at a price, but often travellers wonder how much more do I have to pay to get this quality and service? Where's my value? The Shangri-La is not cheap, but neither is the intrinsic value you will get out of your stay there. It is from my experience one of the most enjoyable hotels I have ever stayed in, they really do make you feel like the most important customer they have, yet you are only one of several hundred. Did I ever stop to consider this during my stay? during the times when I went to the 20th floor to get to my room? No, never! Couple this with the quality offerings, facilities and location then I don't understand why you would want to stay anywhere else in Singapore - If you can afford it. If you can afford more, why bother?

We were incredibly impressed having spent our 2007 Christmas Celebrations in The Line Restaurant and we couldn't wait to actually stay here. We had reserved a Deluxe Garden Wing Pool View Room at our booking and we were bitterly disappointed to be given a room without a view apart from the main entrance and road which was also very noisey. We complained straight away and was advised that we were on a 'reserved list' and we would be moved the following day. We had to wait in until 1pm which wasn't a very good start to our Singapore break. When we did move, it was much quieter, however the pool was barely visible and if you are a fan of brown corrugated roof tops, you are in for a win! We brought it to the attention of the hotel concierge and he duly informed us that our 'block' was going to be destroyed and re-built and hardly anyone was staying in these rooms. We were not filled with much confidence, especially when our curtains didn't close properly and we didn't have any hot water. This was rectified eventually. We have stayed in Singapore three times in the past and stayed at The Robinson Quay Hotel, Copthorne Orchid Hotel and Orchard Parade Hotel (5 mins away from Shangri-La) which are much cheaper, and exceeded our expectations.

The Valley Wing have a complimentary bar in their lobby up to and including champagne and the service is excellent. The hotel based restaurants are formal and quite expensive while The Line is a modern canteen style restaurant where the breakfast offer is wide ranging but the ambiance tends to be a bit chaotic compared with the more stately Summit Room as the fellow residents from the Tower Wing descend for their extensive morning feed. The Line becomes an international buffet in the evenings with an a la carte alternative offer also located there but it is questionable as to how much food you would need to eat to make the buffet good value at nearly \u00a340 per head and as ours needed to be reheated at our request in the microwave we were happy to successfully challenge what we were going to be charged. We experienced a couple of lapses in communication from the beautifully presented Reception staff who would probably benefit from having the means of booking the hotel based restaurants at their disposal rather than having to phone them like a guest would have to. One of the erstwhile excellent waiters had an apparent brainstorm over what marmalade was one morning and finally delivered it to our table in apparent mild frustration at our twice repeated request but otherwise the service was excellent. I don't know if the lady in question was trying out her management skills but in an episode that felt on reflection like blatant discrimination on our last morning I was told that I would need to change my linen shorts if I wanted to enter the Summit room for breakfast.It was a lady that we hadn't seen before but I was wearing shorts that I had certainly worn to breakfast before without a problem and it was only when we spotted another guest leaving the breakfast room in sports shorts that it was accepted that 'on this occasion' it would be ok......for the record more than one subsequent breakfast diner was allowed in afterwards wearing shorts but these were women and I was eagle eyed watching for any men to enter in shorts unchallenged and if they had been I could guarantee you that there would have been a serious complaint.This issue was untypical of the hotel but we could have easily done without it. We loved Singapore but would advise against the tired touristy offer of afternoon tea at Raffles which was offered with minimal effort,style or imagination while we were there( despite the hotel being a lovely looking building) and we much preferred the offer at TWG tea boutique at ION Orchard Mall.

Again you can taste different type of cuisine: Indian, Chinese, Japanese (sushis and sashimis excellent), French, Italian. You wish to have two stomachs! Desserts are French style and very good. Service is excellent, room cleaned and refilled with mineral water and L\u2019Occitane amenities in the bathroom. Be cautious with the bed as it is very hard. You can feel your back at the end of the night. You can\u2019t really stay at the pool as the construction work is heavily noisy. Or you should wear a noise reducer helmet!

This review relates to the Valley Wing but is applicable to the other areas of the hotel. We have stayed here annually for over 20 years but not in 2010. At some time in the past two years the Shangri-La Group has implemented a policy of charging the whole of the cost of the accommodation plus a margin to one's credit card even before one's cases are unpacked. On enquiry you will be told that this is a holding charge and that it will not actually be paid by your card issuer until the final bill is signed off by you unless, presumably, you leave without signing it off or else what is the point in being charged up front in the first place? Being dubious about this statement I took the trouble to ring my bank who kindly monitor my Credit Card account in real time. They told me that the full amount had been taken from my account the minute I authorised the up front \"holding charge\". On being confronted the hotel would not accept this until I insisted they talk to my bank directly. So be aware - you ARE being charged from the minute you arrive for the full length of your stay. Should your final bill come to less than the initial amount charged, which is possible , remember a \"margin\" has also been charged up front, then don't expect an immediate refund, it takes days. This is not unique to the Shangri-La Group and possibly does not apply to those, particularly from the USA, who do not use Chip and Pin cards but still sign slips. I have not tested the system for those who pay cash to see what one is asked for up front. Perhaps some Trip Advisor member will research this and let us all know. All the foregoing has been shared with the hotel at the time personally. At present the Garden Wing is undergoing full renovation probably until early summer 2012 so the noise is too loud to use the pool area during working hours, about 9 to 5, also Saturday mornings. If you can tolerate the Management's attitude to the creditworthiness even of its Golden Circle members then the Valley Wing is still a very good place to stay.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cMutton dressed as lamb\u201d", "Author": "tim.tilford", "ReviewID": "UR121759122", "Content": "The Shangri-La sets itself up as a top class, top quality hotel and falls way short.

The Shangri-La turned out to be just that - Shanri-la. It is set in a quiet area up a hill away from the crowds. While not as convenient to shopping as the Hyatt, it is only a relatively short, pleasant walk of about 1.2km to the corner of Scotts & Orchard Rds. However some may find it a little arduous in the heat But the hotel offers an hourly free shuttle service or you can take a taxi which are quite inexpensive in Singapore. The hotel is genuine 5 star accommodation. While it is not new, it has been continuously maintained. The service is very, very good throughout the hotel - caring without being obsequious. When you return to the hotel after a shopping mission, to be greeted at the hotel entrance is unnecessary but it is a nice welcoming touch. We stayed in the Tower Wing in a Deluxe room.

The pool area is very nice indeed. It is a large (about 40 Meters at it's longest axis) & clean. There are lots of comfortable lounges around it and many umbrellas to reduce the effect of the sun. Lying there is very pleasant indeed and it is quite easy to fall asleep (particularly when you are jet lagged - but getting outdoors in the sun is a good strategy to combat jet lag). When we were there we were not unduly annoyed by young kids, possibly due to the size of the area. The gym is very well equipped and should satisfy all fitness needs. The only downside is the cost of food & drink which is a little on the expensive side. There are a few restaurants just down the hill and of course many more as you progress downtown. However happy hour/s between 6 & 8pm in the Horizon Club does compensate with food & drink (and all day tea & coffee). There are numerous good inexpensive cafes around Singapore.

Unfortunately, we have found hard mattresses to be a common trait amongst the three Shangri-La properties we've stayed in (Rasa Sayang Penang, Hong Kong and now Singapore). Even with housekeeping placing an additional comforter on top, it did little to provide us with a good night's sleep.

The fitness center was also a nice place to either unwind or take time away, as they have a separate area for Male and Female. The hotel ground itself was rather old but nice, not much to see but the pool area was lovely for us to cool our bodies after a long day of shopping or sightseeing.

The hotel is fairly large with 3 \"wings\" - valley wing, garden wing and the tower wing: we stayed in the tower wing and our room was spacious and comfortable with a huge bed and a lovely bathroom with separate bath and walk in shower. We also had a big flatscreen TV and there is free wifi in all hotel rooms. The hotel itself is maintained to a very high standard with an impressive lobby area, and a lovely cake shop/bakery! YUM! The breakfast spread was among the best I have ever seen - the buffet was so huge it took me about 20 mins to decide what to eat, they really do have everything including 6 different flavours of yoghurt from a fresh yoghurt bar!! Western fried english,malaysian, japanese - they really had everything, and the most amazing cakes and pastries!! We were so busy making the most of our time in Singapore that we didnt have dinner in the hotel so cannot comment on the restaurants and dinners, but they are supposed to be good! The hotel is located on Orange Grove Road, and about a 10-15 walk to the start of Orchard Roas - the main shopping strip. There are what feels like hundreds of shopping malls in Singapore - so if shopping is your thing, you are in for a real treat! The pool area is surrounded by trees and beautifully manicured gardens, and the staff were always very friendly and welcoming, and would help find you sunbeds either in the shade or sun according to your preference. There is also a lovely jacuzzi at the poolside, and the pool is open til 10pm which is ideal for a refreshing dip after a hard days sightseeing! As for Singapore itself there really is so much to see and do here! I would strongly suggest you plan as much as possible what you want to do so you can maximise your time in this amazingly clean city! Sentosa Island, just off the coast is being established as a \"resort\" in itself with large resort style hotels, a huge man made beach, underwater world (where you can pre-book to swim with the pink dolphins!), universal studios (not as large as american counterparts but still good fun!), zip park, go karting, bird and butterfly sanctuary, 3D simulator rides etc! This is also where you can see \"songs of the sea\" a light and water show, which has two show times every evening. The zoo is also a must - you can pre-book a jungle breakfast where you actually get to eat alongside the orang-utans (!) and whilst going round the zoo itself you can feed the elephants and see loads of other really amazing animals. The night safari (next to the zoo) is also definitely worth a visit - you get to do a tram tour of the safari park in the dark, and see the animal show and fire show etc! No trip to Singapore would be complete without a trip to Raffles Hotel! Steeped in history and so beautiful! we went for afternoon tea (pre-booked) which was really lovely, and then we had \"singapore slings\" in the place where they were first invented - The Long Bar at Raffles (and incidentally the only place you will see anything dropped on the floor in Singapore - monkey nut shells!) For nightlife, Clarke Quay is where you want to head for a great selection of bars with live music, and any sort of music you would want really! Great atmosphere! For food, I cannot recommend the \"hawker food centres\" enough! There is one at newton (which is closest to the hotel) and there is one called La Pao Sat, which is near Raffles Place. These are outdoor foodcourts where you can eat from a range of small stalls that cook everything fresh to order. Treat yourself to some delicious Singapore Chilli Crab, and also Black Pepper Crab - best thing Ive ever tasted! Singapore is very very expensive, particularly when it comes to alcohol - beware the 10% service charge and 9.5% gov tax added on to EVERYTHING - means that a glass of wine and a beer can cost up to S$48 - just over \u00a325!! Other than that, it is a fantastic place - so enjoy!

We had two interconnecting rooms in the Tower Wing, as part of the Horizon Club. The Horizon Club was good for us, because I could just take the kids upstairs when they felt like a snack! The pool was lovely, a real resort pool at a city hotel. There was a big complimentary fruit basket available too which was a lovely touch. We had lunch by the pool one day: pizza and salad and this was great. The rooms were very clean, and nicely decorated. The children liked the \"day of the week\" carpet in the lift! It was my husbands birthday while we were there and so we also appreciated the complimentary birthday cakes. On his birthday night we had dinner at The Line restaurant which was a fantastic buffet. Everyone enjoyed it, especially the children! It was very busy in the restaurant but the service, again, was excellent.

I am fairly loyal to the Shangri La chain and have stayed in their hotels across Asia. Throughout most of the chain, it's the service that distinguish this chain over the others. The Shangri La Singapore property on Orange Grove Road is situated on beautiful grounds with lush vegetation and one of the most awesome swimming pools you could ever imagine. There are 3 different guest room buildings, each with a distinct personality. So you should pick the right building for your accommodations to match the purpose of your visit, your expectations, and your budget. The Garden Wing is a low slung building with more a resort feel it. Many rooms have large balconies overlooking the pool. The balconies are spilling over with flowering bushes and the whole building is surrounded by palm trees and waterfalls and ponds. The Valley Wing is sedate and sophisticated with plenty of gold gilt and crystal chandeliers. It is where the visiting heads of state stay. (And you often see discreet body guards stationed around when someone important is staying there). The rooms are huge and lushly furnished with heavy drapery. There is a dressing room and bath which can be closed off with doors for privacy if you're not traveling alone. There is a harpist playing in the lobby each evening during cocktails and they serve a limited breakfast in the semi circular dining room off the lobby, with its starched white table linens. The Tower Wing is between these two buildings, both in style and location, and the decor is somewhat \"post modern\". Many of the larger guest rooms of this older building were created by combining two adjoining rooms. The Tower Wing features the hotel's Horizon Club on the top floor (24) with a large, nicely furnished lounge serving morning breakfast and evening cocktails for those who have upgrade to the Tower Wing's Horizon Club floors. They also serve coffee and pastries during the day. It has always been a good place to have casual business meetings and I've negotiated a lot of business deals there. The club also has 2 conference rooms available for small private meetings and a small area with 3 computers where you can check your emails. Free wireless is available for guests throughout the hotel. The Tower Wing also houses a large, well equipped gym on the ground floor with sauna, steam and whirlpool off the locker rooms. It serves the entire hotel, regardless of which building you stay in. They also offer spa services. I can't recommend the massage offered in the spa. A Horizon Club room in the Tower Wing has always been my choice due to these immediate amenities. The largest room category (where they combined two rooms to form one generous guest room) features a huge desk which most business travelers would appreciate. Lots of plugs and a broadband connection but surprisingly no in-room printer / fax. (For that you have to go up the Horizon Club or down to the business center.) Closet space is adequate and there is an iron and ironing board. The marble bath is enormous and offers a big walk-in shower and separate tub (although not jetted). Bedside controls for the draperies, lighting, and air con are hard to operate in the middle of night or without your glasses on. In the last few years the Tower Wing has become almost too popular, especially when the hotel is hosting a conference. Some evenings, as happened to me on my last 3 visits, I went up to the Horizon Club to read the day's paper and have a cocktail, only to find there was no place to sit. (The option was to share an already intimate table with strangers.) And for the some, finding children rummaging through the canapes and running around unattended may not be your idea of relaxing at the end of a long day of meetings. (Go next door to the bar where they will serve you in a much quieter setting, albeit without the cheeses and canapes.) The Horizon Club guests are offered complimentary breakfast in the adjacent 24th floor dining room of BLU, the hotel's late night dining spot. Breakfast service lately has bordered on inept. Save yourself the aggravation and go downstairs to The Line for breakfast. The options are greater and, since it's basically self service, you can pace your own meal. So while you pay a premium for Horizon Club benefits, it is not often money well spent when you cannot avail yourself to what you are paying for. The Line is the Shangri La's buffet style dining option on the ground floor between the Tower Wing and the Valley Wing. Open from breakfast to dinner, it features usually very good food. But the experience can bring new meaning to \"self service\". Trying to get a glass of water or coffee can be difficult as the servers are instead focused on clearing tables. And while The Line is casual dining, the noise from the kitchen areas and frequent opening of the sliding doors leading to the terrace can make for a warm, humid and noisy dining experience. Fine if you are there in shorts and t-shirts with family. But perhaps not so good if you are in a suit and tie and with clients. But the hotel features multiple dining options, so just choose carefully. I give the Shangri La an 'A' for effort but a 'B' on execution. They do their best to offer something for both the guests on holiday and those there on business. Over the years the service levels withing this particular hotel have clearly fallen off. Still, if you don't want to be down in center of town, this is an appealing option. Just walking around the beautiful grounds can be a great way to unwind.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cThe Valley Wing - a lesson in luxury and good service\u201d", "Author": "emily79", "ReviewID": "UR117068173", "Content": "I recently stayed in the Valley Wing of the Shangri-La in Singapore.

The guest rooms are good: clean, roomy, most have nice views. My suite this time was really very good, but is beginning to show signs of deterioriation (the light switches were almost broken, e.g.).

I was in room 1030 (10th floor) in the high rise tower (24 floors) overlooking a huge green rooftop below and the pool area to the left. There is a fantastic restaurant and bar with viewing deck up on level 24 - BLU - superb to go around sunset 6.30pm - 7pm. Overall I really enjoyed my stay at Shangri-La. It is a huge complex - there is a high rise tower, geared more to the business traveller (you cant open the windows) and there is a low-rise wing around the pool with balconies, I presume geared more to the leisure traveller. The lush tropical gardens around the pool and surrounding the breakfast/lunch restaurant (\"In Line\") are beautiful. It is hard to believe you are 10-15 mins walk from the busiest intersection in all of Singapore - corner Orchard Road and Scotts Road. Apart from the refurbed \"In Line\" restaurant (very modern white/orange decor) the rest of the hotel feels somewhat tired and probably saw its best days quite a while ago! Attention to detail is also lacking - 2 globes in my room were broken, my bathroom switch was cracked and posed a safety risk, the huge mirrors in the level 10 lift area were dirty for a week and nobody noticed to clean the dirty fingerprints from them. I did however like the 2 pieces of fruit left for me each day in my room and the quality of towels, bed linen and bathroom products - all very good quality. The king sized bed was very firm but I had an excellent sleep. I liked the remote control panel next to the bed where you could activate all lights, air con, and curtains. The buffet breakfast and lunch in \"In Line\" were FANTASTIC. No matter what you wanted for breakfast, it was there - pancakes, waffles, sausages, quiche, individually made omelettes/eggs, Japanese sushi, Indian curries, nasi goreng rice dishes, pastries, home made breads, 8 different kinds of fresh fruits - just amazing! Just make sure you ask for an individually made cappuccino - the filter coffee in the pot is luke warm and not very nice. Note - The dessert buffet at lunch time just makes your eyes pop out of your head!! I had the nicest rare roast beef and Chinese style pork dish. Really good. We also used the Business Centre which had 3 meeting rooms for hire - very up to date modern facilities. All in all, I would recommend Shangri-La to leisure travellers who want to be in a resort-style complex away from the crazy Orchard Road shopping district in a spacious, tranquil setting. For me personally, I prefer the Marriott on the corner of Orchard/Scotts. It is a high rise tower, with pool on level 3 or 4 from memory over looking the city and down Orchard Road and the whole hotel is more modern and feels newer and more sophisticated. I also like Marriott location better - smack bang in the centre of all the Orchard Road action - the Tangs Dept store is in the same building and Isetan Dept store is across the road as is the Ion Plaza and Wheelock Plaza.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cThis is truly a 5-star hotel with exquistie service\u201d", "Author": "GloriaAnchio", "ReviewID": "UR114020129", "Content": "If you have heard about top class hotels in Asia, with superb service, the Shangri La Hotel in Singapore exemplifies this description.

Singapore is a haven for shopping along the Orachard Road, shops, restaurants and more. Shangri La hotel is situated at the top of the Orchard Road in a quiet residential area. We walked the entire length of the Orchard road on our first day, popping in to shops and cafe's along the way all the way to the Sky Wheel Flyer. The walk took us 5 hours! fantastic. Be warned it will rain on occasion so take a brolly just in case. I would definately go back to Singapore, but probably stay in one of the hotels on Orchard road, as like I said it was too commercialised, but really worth the visit. My only negative was the house keeping, not really on par with other 5 star service.

The hotel is celebrating its 40 th anniversary but is till going strong. Some guests have styed here nearly 200 times which gives you an idea of how good the service is. Check in was quick and efficient. There are ladies greeting you as you come in who wisk you to the reception desk and everyone is so uncomfortable if you insist on carrying one of your bags. I had stored some baggage the second time and the front desk arranged for the bellboy to deliver it--not like some other five star hotels where they tell you to go to the concierge after check-in and talk to the bellboy yourself. On both occasions my rooms were spacious (I had the standard category of room), modern and spotlessly clean. There is lots of complimentary water and fresh fruit everyday. Internet is speedy (cable or WIFI) and free. The only issue I had was that the room was very cold (18-19C) at night and the duvet very thin. There was no way to regulate the aircon so I had to take the key out of the electricty slot to stop the airconditioning and wear a bathrobe over my pjs. Bathroom is also spacious and has good amenities. The gym is fantastic. Unlike many first class hotels, they don't close the gym during the night., which is greatly appreciated by night owls or jet lagged travellers! After midnight when there are no attendants you just use your card key to get in. The food in the coffee shop is mediocre and service alate at night when it was not so busy was a bit slow. I couldn't possibly get value for money with the huge buffet breakfast so I ate a la carte and the waitress remembered exactly how I liked all my food items the next day and even arranged for her colleague to deliver my breakfast the way I liked it during her off day. Really incredible service in the morning. I also tried room service for breakfast which had an excellent \"Healthy Start\" selection not on the a la caret menu in the coffee shop. It takes under 30 minutes to get your food from the time you order. The Chinese restaurant is frequented mostly by Chinese and is excellent, especially the Chef's signature dishes.

We gave them the benefitof doubt and went on down stairs to THE LINE and then to our disgust this happened every morning.....Sorry Sir/Madam would yhou mind waiting. So after 30 mins my Husband got anoyed to they tried hushing him up by putting him in the front of the que. We wouldn't allow that to happen when others were waiting far longer than us. However to cut the stoy short, we eventually proceeded down to the 3rd floor again as we had to do every other day due to the same old excuse. Then we went to the Coctail hourfrom 6pm till 9pm only to find when we walked in at 7pm we were asked to come back as there were no seats available. We were horrified and my husband was very verbal ( not swearing of course) with them the next morning as this went on everyday. We paid BIG BUCKS for our suite and H Club. We after found out the reason for the crowds...the H Club is no longer exclusive and every man and his DOG can join, therefore it's no over crowded. Did they REFUND US our HCLUB benefits that we did not receive.....NO NO NO NO!! of course not, they are in control of your credit card and can do what they like. After many years of travelling and forming a friendship with this one hotel chain it's now time to move on.....GOOD luck with you FREEBIES to all new customers of Shangri la.....it won;t last LONG.. After good customers like me don't book with them they have to look to new customer service GIMMICKS. Take what ever yhou can Now as it won;t last LONG.....GOOD BYE Shangri La.I could once say Singapore was the best branch. Gone are those days. Best you look into your new Management. IT SUCKS!!!

I have stayed at the hotel several times before, including once just before our wedding. In fact, I used to live with my late parents for several years just 50 meters from the hotel, and came quite often to the hotel for a nice meal, so there was a poignancy to this visit. The hotel is tucked just 5-10 minutes from Orchard Road (I recommend taking Anderson Rd and Claymore Rd as a shortcut and my favorite route) on a verdant, winding green street called Orange Grove Road; there are still a couple of mock Tudor houses that remind one of what it was like in decades past. Your taxi will take you up the driveway to a wide, yet secluded area, where red and black liveried bellmen will assist you with your baggage as you are welcomed by senior staff at the hotel. The lobby has been reconfigured several times over the years, but what has been constant is the soaringly high ceilings gently suffused with some natural light, almost like a cathedral. Check-in was immediate, and we were quickly in our room. The standard room itself was attractive, with a circular alcove with a bay window at the far end, a dresser near the king-sized bed, a good sized desk, and the bathroom using semi-opaque glass tiles for walls to provide more lighting to the room without being see-through as in some other hotel designs. The bathroom was large and lovely, with a big tub and a generously-sized circular shower. My only criticism of the room is that because it operates on the system that your keycard turns on the power, the power and the airconditioning is actually off in a lot of rooms for much of the day. This is eco-friendly, but does leave a faint trace of a mildewy smell in the room given the tropical climate, carpets etc. We were somewhat disappointed with The Line restaurant, which we ate at on our first night, but maybe it was not representative because we ate a la carte, and it was Chinese New Year's Eve. However, the food was only average approximations of local specialties, costing 5-6x the price, and because we love coming to Singapore to eat it was a bit of a let down, given how many great meals I've had at this hotel, in their coffee shop, over the decades. A subsequent trip for breakfast though did make up for that, which was quite impressive. A nice feature is the shuttle bus that takes guests to the Orchard road area and back on the hour. Cabs are always on hand, which is great given the perennial taxi shortage in Singapore. Also what is wonderful is simply the grounds of the hotel, which you can stroll around in probably for a good 20 minutes. You are also very close to the Botanical Gardens, which is about 20 minutes' walk (via Fernhill, Nassim, Lermit and Cluny) and which is a great place for a run in the early morning (the hotel also has a great gym and spa). My daughter was delighted with the property and I do think it is very welcoming to families. I would definitely recommend it to others.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Derby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service\u201d", "Author": "Blaze14", "ReviewID": "UR95973316", "Content": "Before we left the UK, I was quite concerned about staying here after reading some of the reviews about this hotel, however they were all totally unfounded.

Our 2 boys were allocated their room first and, I must say, we were a little disappointed. We'd stayed in this hotel a few years earlier - also in the Garden Wing - and the rooms hadn't changed at all, apart from more wear and tear! The wall beside the desk had black marks on it, the faux-wood floor had quite a few black streaks on it and one of the glass ledges in the bathroom cabinet basically collapsed. The plastic handle on the shower screen was also badly chipped. The phone didn't work! And when it did there were annoying dialling tones in the background making it impossible for anyone to hear us. When I eventually got through to the front desk they immediately sent up lots of people to check everything out - can't complain about the service! A new phone didn't fix our telecommunications problems - not that I ever thought it would - so they logged a maintenance call (which duly fixed the problem later that day). We were offered another room on the top (9th) floor but, in the end, I asked them to fix all the other superficial problems because everyone was tired and we needed to rest. The room for me and my wife was in better condition. They delivered 2 small boxes of chocolates later in the day to our rooms to help us 'overcome' all the issues we'd encountered. I must make a special mention of the televisions: it's insane that they still have CRT TVs in these Garden Wing rooms!! This is 2011 folks and we're talking about a 5-star hotel in a pretty advanced country! Not acceptable. Our room bookings came with buffet breakfasts at The Line restaurant. All very nice - lots of wonderful food - but the service was a little lacking on the last two days. Plates not cleared promptly (had to continually move them to an empty table) and generally slow table service. Not sure why this was the case when the service on the 1st two days was impeccable. Staff at the front desks, concierge, room-keeping, gym etc were all top notch! So, in as much as I've always loved the 'Shang', I don't think I'll be staying there next time we visit Singapore until I find out that they've finally renovated the rooms.

We used TripAdvisor to find our Hotel and as this was one of the most popular in Singapore we decided to give it a try. We booked 2 Horizon Club rooms as Breakfast is notoriously expensive in most Hotels we've stayed at and for the included Breakfast with Canapes and Cocktails in the evening, this more than made up for the extra charge for Horizon Club. We were on the 16th Floor but I have a suspicion that is the \"Family Floor\" as most other guests there seemed to be travelling with Children which was fine. Alcohol is expensive almost everywhere in Singapore and Shangri-La is no exception. Expect to pay S$20 for any alcoholic beverage, regardless of whether its a glass of beer or a cocktail, which was a bit bizarre and the cocktails seemed like they were more lolly water than containing any actual alcohol, but since they were free between 6 and 8 in the Horizon Club, no big deal. The staff were always extremely courteous and helpful, the doorman in the setdown area even paid for our taxi at one point when the taxi-driver's Credit Card machine had stopped working. I'm not sure if this is a common practice or not, but it was a huge help at the time. Our 3 year old daughter was at all times treated like a princess, none of the staff ever spoke over her, they always specifically said hello to her and asked her how she was. This was such a relief to have her so welcomed because we weren't sure how the hotel would feel about having young children, but there was no cause for concern at all.

My spouse and I were very tired after a long flight from London and were keen to get settled into our room. Many reviewers place a great deal of emphasis on the check in (not me) and for this reason I will mention it. It was quick and painless, but the ever hoped for upgrade was not forthcoming because it is a very busy time of the year. (29th December). We were quickly taken to our rooms but not before we had a chance to take in the opulent lofty lobby with huge Christmas tree and stunning chandeliers. The first impression of the room was the view of Singapore. I could have sat and looked at it for hours. The room was not huge, but it was not a bad size. The bed was very large and comfortable, the curtains were remote control from the console panel by the bed. The bathroom had everything I expected from a bathroom including a walk in shower, bathrobes, hair drier, slippers,good toiletries and modern weighing scales. As with most hotel bedrooms, there never seems to be enough space for stowing clothing etc, but as we were only staying for 3 days, this was a very minor niggle. There was an ironing board and iron to get rid of those unwanted wrinkles. The air conditioning was efficient, but not quiet enough for my husband. The next morning, it was off to the gym to check it out. There were five treadmills, two cross trainers, two rowing machines, recumbent bike and upright bike, two further cross trainers with a different leg action (forget the name) and a good range of free standing weights and a standalone weight machine. The equipment looked quite new and was in excellent order. I did not have the time to try out the pool or sauna, but be aware that the sauna facilities are single sex. There was help on hand, if required. There was only one small niggle and this was half our fault. We went to bed early the first evening as jet lag had caught up with us and the turndown service knocked on the door and we said that we did not need it. Half an hour later it happened again waking us up! We realised the next morning that we had not pressed the do not disturb button which displays outside the room. We had breakfast in the Line Restaurant each morning during our stay and the range and quality of food was excellent from the freshly squeezed juices (try the Mango and Mint \u2013 delicious) to the Sushi Bar. There was food to cater for every taste and nationality. One morning I tried the vegetable curry and parathas and it was very good indeed. (It may seem to be a rather bizarre choice of breakfast for westerners, but go on, try it!). After dining out one evening, we returned to the hotel for a nightcap and were entertained with live music and a female singer which was very pleasant. Drinks were served with a selection of nuts and nibbles. Service was quick and beautifully delivered as mentioned by a previous poster. The staff were always concerned for our well-being. One morning we were waiting for the complimentary tour of Singapore and our pick up was late. This was noticed by a member of staff who quickly phoned the operator to find out what had happened. A taxi was sent to pick us up to catch up with the tour. This became a bit of a farce because we missed half of the tour and there were many tours going on but none of them seemed to want to be responsible for us. We played catch up for most of the tour, with the driver taking us from one spot to another to try to place us. The problem was not anything to do with the hotel, but an administrative error on the part of the tour operator who seemed to think that we were stopping at a different hotel. The location of the hotel is off the Orchard Road, which can be a bit of a trek to get to certain parts, particularly in this climate, but we found it to be convenient for our needs and the taxis were very efficient and reasonable. The harbour is spectacular with the interesting architecture \u2013 particularly the newish hotel (nicknamed the Banana Boat by our taxi driver). The must do activity in Singapore is go for a Singapore Sling in the Raffles Hotel. We did it of course but it was only memorable for the cost of the pink drinks and the custom of discarding empty ground nut shells on the floor. Only residents and diners can enter the hotel and the Long Bar (which is not particularly long) is accessed from outside the hotel. It seems that the dress code for the bar is \u2018anything goes\u2019. We trekked around the McRitchie Reservoir (approx 15 km) which included rainforest and water locations. This was much needed exercise and definitely worthwhile as we were able to experience rainforest flora and fauna (skinks, water monitor, macaque monkies etc). The sounds of the rainforest were amazing. The exercise was vigorous and not for the unfit. It took approximately 3.5 hours. Good walking footwear is needed and remember to apply sunscreen and bug repellent. My enduring memory of Singapore is the friendliness of the people and the immaculate surroundings. There was absolutely no litter or gum on the pavements and the whole place was like a very well tended garden. We felt completely safe at all times and there is virtually no crime at all because of the harsh penalties. The Botanical Gardens are very close by and are worth a visit. There is an extra charge for the Orchid Garden.

We were not disappointed. The Shangri-La was pure elegance. Enormous, but with totally understated style. As we entered the gigantic lobby we were met by one of the many greeting staff, all of whom were tiny Malay girls in kimono style dresses. The colour of the dresses blended subtly with the area of the lobby where they were stationed. We were ushered to the reception desk, but as we gave our name, another girl in a black kimono, which seemed to signify some degree of seniority, glided up to us and informed us that we had been upgraded to be guests of the Hotel\u2019s \u201cHorizon Club\u201d. She took us to the bank of lifts and accompanied us to a private reception area on the 24th floor, where she introduced us to yet more reception staff. We were advised that if we required anything at any time of the day or night, we should call that desk. We were shown the private \u201cmembers\u201d breakfast room, and also the members lounge, which was open all day. We were then shown to our Club Suite on the 22nd floor. It was enormous. There was even an office/study area with a semi-circular desk complete with a leather swivel chair. The outer wall was entirely glass from floor to ceiling, giving spectacular views over the city. I had begun to worry about the strain of manoeuvring the enormous volume of curtaining that hung at these windows, so I was extremely relieved to find a control panel by the bed from which the curtains, lights, and air-conditioning could be controlled electronically. We took breakfast in the Horizon Lounge, which was excellent, and also ate in the Hotel's buffet restaurant called \"The Line\". This is an extremely modern facility which is totally at odds with the period charm of the hotel itself, but nevertheless extremely good. In fact last time I looked it had a Trip Advisor popularity rating of 6th out of 1600 Singapore restaurants.

She was wearing the standard kimono type dress as worn by other employees in the hotel, only it was a pale olive green which toned perfectly with the d\u00e9cor in the lounge, and it was slashed to the hip on both sides. When she returned with the order she did not bend down to place the glasses on the table. Keeping a perfectly straight back she bent her knees and slowly descended until she was kneeling on the ground. She placed the glasses on the table, rocked back very gently on her heels and rose to stand upright, again keeping her back completely straight. We were quite astonished. We sat at the table for some time watching the waitresses, who all performed in the same gymnastic fashion, regardless of the weight of stuff being carried on their trays. This extraordinary method of serving was unique to this Lobby Lounge. On reflection I would say that the Shangri-La is undoubtedly one of the finest hotels I have ever experienced. The service was incredible without being obtrusive, the attention to detail was amazing. The carpets in the lifts had the day of the week subtly incorporated in their design. These were, of course, changed every day. On our last morning as we were leaving the room a cleaner appeared. We told her that the room did not need doing as we were checking out later that day. She said that we might be in the room until later in the afternoon so she must clean it for us. We would unreservedly recommend this hotel, and very much hope to return in the not too distant future.", "Date": "January 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cDISAPPOINTING\u201d", "Author": "PigsEar1", "ReviewID": "UR92279429", "Content": "We stayed in a Horizon Club Room for 3 nights at end of Dec and were v disappointed. The room was OK, no complaints. HOWEVER, the service within the hotel was pathetic. On the first morning, we went up to Blu where we were supposed to get our Club Floor breakfast only to find a queue of 10+ people as all the tables were taken. We were told that they had set up a small buffet in the Club Lounge and we should go there only to find the tables set for breakfast were all taken. We complained to one of the lounge assistants and they took us down to The Line for the buffet breakfast but it was not to be - the queue at The Line was enormous with 20+ people waiting to be seated. So back up to Blu was the best bet and half an hour later we sat down for breakfast. Once seated, service was again non existent when a glass of water ordered never arrived and there were no glasses left for orange juice at the buffet. SO, the lesson, we had to get up v early each subsequent morning to ensure we were first in Blu. For the first eveing we wanted to book The Line for dinner as one of us is vegetarian and it was by far the best option. We tried to book at 8am and it was full so we then asked to book for the following night but it was full ALL night. After kicking up a fuss i.e. 5* hotel where we can't get breakfast or dinner the Club Lounge assistant got us a place at the restaurant albeit at an inconvenient time. Our conclusions: 1. There are too many Club rooms for the Lounge or the facilities- virtually the entire Tower Wing seems to be Club rooms. We expect to be in a minority not the majority when on Club Floor i.e. top 2 floors only 2. The hotel as a whole does not have enough eating facilities or staff for the number of rooms.

The breakfast was great with various choices. The staff was polite, particularly those helpful guys at the taxi stand and inside the lobby. I stayed there for 3 nights for a business trip at the end of November. As the booking was tight the staying plan was different in these 3 nights: it was cheaper with no breakfast for the first night. During check-in I was told that I needed to check out on next morning in order to change to another plan. I asked if I could have the same room coz I didn't want to pack my luggage (not to mention it's more expensive for the next two nights) but the lady said \"no, coz the plan would be upgraded\". Okay. I understood. On next morning at the check-out counter I was told to go back to my room!!! After a time-consuming check-out and check-in procedure I went back to the original room...for an \"upgraded\" plan with breakfast and fruit and drinks. In the second night when I went back from work, late at night, after unpacking my luggage, I found there was no fruit for me. Two handkerchieves were missing but one more medium sized towel was found. I consumed two tea bags in the morning but no one brought them back to me. As no one told me where to have breakfast and drinks, I phoned to the front desk. During the conversation the line was cut but no one called me back. I was too tired to call again so I hurried to bed after a shower. In the third night I saw two bananas in the room. They finally remembered it!! The missing tea bags still hadn't returned. The two handkerchieves came back and the third medium-sized towel had gone. However, something was found on the floor of the bathroom: glass fragments!! Didn't the one who broke the glass know this may hurt when someone stepped on it with bare feet????

I stayed in the main wing, but I heard the rooms in the garden wing are even more spectacular. Some downsides: The price is on the high side and can be extremely variable as with most Singapore hotels depending on the time of year and demand, but seems compatible to most high end business hotels.

All Valley Wing guests are able to get free champagne, wine and canapes from 10.30am to 10.30pm, but be careful if you eat all the canapes on offer, you will not be able to eat a full meal in the evening. Blu restaurant in the Tower Wing was very nice, but a bit expensive. Breakfast in Valley Wing was great but don't bother to go to the Line Restaurant for breakfast as it is less relaxing. We had a massage whilst there but were unaware that there is a sauna and steam room there until our last day. Swimming pool and sunbathing areas of a good size for a city Hotel. Location of Hotel is about a 5 minute walk to Orchard Road Shopping Malls. Getting around Singapore is very easy on the trains, apart from getting lost in the huge Shopping Malls which are around every station.

On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by friendly hotel staff who whisked us to reception to complete our checkin formalities with ease. The reception itself is very large and plush with crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Our room was located in the Tower Wing of the hotel and it was of a good size. The view from the enclosed balcony window over looked the pool area, which was an oasis set in beautiful landscaped gardens. As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary the hotel had placed rose petals in a heart shape on the bed and placed two red roses on our pillows, which was a wonderful gesture and really thoughtful of the staff. The cleanliness of the room was exceptional and the furnishings where of a very high standard. The bathroom was also spotless and it had a separate walk in shower, as well as the usual bath. The room was serviced twice a day and there was complimentary bottled drinking water left in our room each day. Breakfast was served in The Line restaurant and there was an excellent choice of food available. My only criticism would be that on a couple of occasions there were coffee/tea stained mugs laid out on the breakfast table and one morning we had to wait 30 minutes for someone to bring us the drinks we had ordered. I would, however, say that once the staff were made aware of these problems they were rectified straight away. The hotel also has an excellent health club with the gym being open 24 hours (useful for those guests who are jet lagged and find it difficult to sleep at night). Also in the health club was a sauna, steam room and jacuzzi, and if you wanted there was a list of treatments available. The majority of staff we encountered during our two week stay were very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for them.

Knowing we'd be bleary-eyed and cranky from a long-haul flight, our criteria for selecting accommodation was: 1. Quiet rooms with thick walls and cloud-like pillows and beds. 2. Easy, fuss-free, check-in/check-out, with an early arrival, late departure. 3. A sumptuous breakfast, catering for a health nut, a gourmet fiend and a fussy-with-food kid. 4. Enough on-site facilities to keep us relaxed, entertained and rejuvenated. 5. A location that was away from the crowds, yet a stone's throw from retail therapy if needed. 6. A gorgeous view, exemplary service and a few extra little luxuries wouldn't go astray. The Shangri-La ticked every box for us. Plus (equally important), it's stamped with a calm, tranquility and luxury, WITHOUT the pretention normally associated with 5-star hotels. Or 5-star hotel business clubs, for that matter. The Horizon Club rooms are HUGE. You could have a party in the bathroom alone. The pillow menu allows the choice of a great sleep, a deep sleep or a sleep where you think you're in heaven. The private breakfast lounge on the 22nd floor, the all day refreshments, the private check-in desk, the free broadband, all make a very comfortable package. Downstairs, the pool is big enough to get some reasonable laps in, the gym is well faciiltated and the tennis courts kept in good order. The cafe serves decent cafe lattes (hard to find in Asia!). The staff are efficient but warm and personable. In short, it's a lovely hotel. If you want a luxury hotel, it's probably the most well-rounded luxury hotels in Singapore. It's 5-star priced. But if you want 4-star prices, look for a 4-star hotel. (Having said that, we checked in at 7.30am, departed 7.30pm the following night and only paid 1 night.

If you want to get out into the more 'real' parts of Sing then you can jump on an MRT from Orchard and explore the city at more length. So in general the location is very good. My only negative comment would be that the Garden Wing rooms are in need of some modernisation perhaps.

The Line Restaurant. If you are staying in this hotel or anywhere in Singapore you must try one of the buffet nights in The Line.

Access to the business centre was extremely handy for internet use. 'High Tea' which was served in the middle of the day and afternoon was wonderful - thank you to all staff who always remembered our favourite sandwiches and who served us our endless glasses of moet champagne and Singapore slings!

Our room in the valley wing was fabulous - loved the large comfy bed and complimentary bottles of water, as well as the beautiful l'occitane toiletries (which by the way I am now addicted to). The tea which was delivered to our room as a welcome on our first day was a lovely touch. The pool was large and clean and surrounded by lush gardens which seemed to provide a very serene environment for a bit of sunbaking. Eating at the Line Restaurant is a must for every visitor - the buffet was extensive, and the rack of lamb was the best I've ever had! We greatly appreciated the complimentary shuttle bus which runs every hour and takes you into some excellent shopping areas, as well as giving you better access to the metro. Many people don't seem to like the location of the hotel but we enjoyed being a little out of the way, surrounded by lush gardens and being away from the hustle and bustle - the shuttle got us close enough to all the action! Finally, I have to say that all the staff were fantastic - they were immaculately dressed and always willing to help and offer the highest level of service - I have not come across such people anywhere else in the world and I can not commend them enough - you are all a credit to the hotel!

We had breakfast in the Summit Room on two mornings (despite only staying 1 night), and found it to be a very pleasant experience with wonderful staff and good food. Overall, the staff were very helpful and the ambiance of the hotel was very relaxing. The staff responded quickly and genuinely to all of our concerns and queries, and made our stay most pleasant. We had 2 concerns though. The first was that despite providing wonderful Wedgewood teapot, cups and saucers in the room, the provided tea was not up to standard. The staff managed to fix this for us with appreciation from my wife. The other issue was the cost. Whilst I was prepared for the higher room costs for a special experience, I was surprised at checkout that an additional 17% was added to the room charges for service and tax. At all other hotels that we have stayed at (including other Shangri-La properties), the quoted rates have all been inclusive of taxes and service charges.

Nevertheless, I would still recomment the hotel, even a Shangri La working slightly below par is an excellent hotel and if you go treat yourself to an evening at Blu.", "Date": "September 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cVery nice but plenty of room for improvement\u201d", "Author": "ridgebackfan", "ReviewID": "UR45099264", "Content": "I stayed here for a week in a Horizon Club level room in the main tower. Asked to be moved from the first room given because housekeeping had done a shabby job. Dust abounded and it looked like someone walked in the bathtub with muddy shoes. To the hotel's credit, they moved me promptly and with zero hassle. They also bumped my room category level up one notch. The problem areas of the hotel were housekeeping and restaurant/Horizon Club staff. Perhaps staffing levels in both were insufficient. Housekeeping staff always appeared in a big rush and they often missed things - For example, I had to wonder if they bothered cleaning the bathroom floor and tub one day because of assorted debris. Another day they failed to empty the dirty towels from the linen basket. One day I asked the front desk manager to provide an extra pad for the bed because I found their mattress too hard. She called housekeeping in front of me; however they failed to show up in my room and I never received an explanation. The next day, I renewed my request at the front desk and this time a manager made certain that it was done. I also had some concerns about service in the restaurant and at lounge for both breakfast and cocktails. It regularly took a minimum of 10 and sometimes as long as 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee. Not only would I be back in my chair after a trip to the buffet table, but I'd be halfway through with my plate before my beverage would arrive. A drink request in the lounge usually required a similar amount of time for delivery. I can live with waiting a few extra minutes for a cocktail but not so much for morning coffee. The front desk staff and the doormen are the shining jewels of the hotel. Unfortunately the food and beverage manager, and the housekeeping manager, require immediate assistance. Also on the plus side, the rooms were comfortable and the bathrooms quite nice. The rooms could stand some renewal however. For example, the peach carpet. I highly recommend the chinese restaurant on the lobby level. I noticed it was very popular with the locals but not many hotel guests made use of it. That's one hotel restaurant that should not be avoided! It was good value and the food quality was extremely high.

In Kuala Lumpur, we usually only stay at either the Shangri La or its sister hotel, the Trader's and are always satisfied with the service. This time, I barely slept a wink on the 13 hour flight from London, so just wanted a place to rest my head. I was told that we were upgraded from what our voucher had said (A Deluxe in the Tower Wing) to a Garden Wing Room. I foolishly beleieved them because I had status miles with a number of their airline partners. When we got to the room I was apalled. It smelt musty, there was paint chipping from the furniture, it had an old style TV and the room looked as if it hadnt been renovated in close to a decade. This was certainly not the standard I expected from the Shangri La. I decided to just rest and when I woke refreshed I could deal with the matter in a calm and rational manner, but despite my insistence that this was not a room that the Shangri La should be touting as an upgrade, the front office and reservations staff continued to insist that it was. At one point I even called the reservations from my mobile to ask the rack rate for the different rooms and was told that the rack rate for the room of my voucher was more than that of my upgrade....HOW CAN IT BE AN UPGRADE IF THE VALUE OF THE ROOM IS LESS THAN THAT OF MY VOUCHER? Where Im from....this is a DOWNGRADE... It was only on my FOURTH attempt (which I shouldnt have had to make) and strong emphatic insistence that I see the room for which my voucher was did staff confirm with me that I was actually downgraded. What a disappointment. Moreover, I was never oferred an apology, or a 'GENUINE' upgrade. Sure the Garden Wing has bigger rooms with a balcony, but that doesnt do me too much good with a 16 month old baby....Id rather have a cleaner, newer, less tatty room with proper functioning lights, a TV and a nicer bathroom. The food and other amenities were great, but please dont fall for this Upgrade routine if you ever do decide to stay here....after staying with this chain for over 100 nights, Ive lost patience and confidence with them....they simply dont value repeat customers it seems....

However, the temptation of two nights paid for by Singapore Airlines made the Shangri La quite tempting. We were so pleased with our visit, that we would consider staying here again. Right from our early morning arrival at the hotel, the service was fantastic. I would have to say that the front desk clerk was one of the best I have ever encountered. Even though someone else was picking up the tab for our room, the front desk was totally focused on our needs and preferences, even well before check in time. I was so grateful for his kindness. I have never been a big fan of the Tower Wing at this hotel, and the rooms there are quite small, so if you have a lot of luggage, beware. However, the rooms are totally efficient and pleasant. and well-decorated with great linens The bathrooms have new mosaic tile and nice amenities. There is also free internet, and some spectacular views of the city. We were really quite pleased. The room attendant was first-rate, and always made sure the room was promptly serviced. She took a real interest in our comfort, and indeed in the appearance of the whole floor. A slight criticism I would have is that the hallway carpet and elevator carpet going up to the room looked like it could use a bit of a clean, if not replacement. Not horrible, but a bit tired. No significant complaints other than room size. The pool at the Shang is great. A beautiful tropical atmosphere, and the hotel supplies plenty of reading material, which I thought was a nice touch. Lots of young families at the pool, but there was room for everyone, and anyone wanting to chill out had no problems. The Line, the Shang's main restaurant was GREAT. I was very pleased with the quality and variiety of the food. I was particularly impressed by how well kept the food was. For instance, instead of the warm juice you can encounter on some buffets, the Shang has a great refrigeration system. Everything that was supposed to be cold actually was....no room termperature stuff allowed. A really pleasant environment in which to enjoy your meal, as you look out over the Shang's verdant grounds. The hotel's physical site must be one of the most pleasant of any Singapore hotel. The gym at the Shang is very large for a hotel gym.. Lots of equipement of all varieties.. At least six elliptical machines alone, two rowers along with a lot of equipment I have never seen in my local gym.. Everything in good working order. Nice shower and sauna area. The only other complaint that I would have about the Shang is their laundry pricing. It was the most expensive I have encountered in Asia, although many of the hotels I stay in are more expensive than the Shang. Usually in Asia, the laundry is fairly affordable compared to other locales, even at top notch hotels. The Shang really took that to new heights, and I hope they will reconsider this policy. I know they have some room rates that include laundry, so this made the cost especially surprising. Anyway, I would still have to say that the Garden Wing looks nicest to me, but the Tower is quite fine in almost every respect, and any deficiencies were overcome by the great service from all the staff at this fine hotel.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cheshire", "Title": "\u201cTrip of a life time\u201d", "Author": "tinman169", "ReviewID": "UR40028076", "Content": "We stayed here for 4 nights at the start of our trip of a life time to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary, we were given a free upgrade to the garden wing which over looked the swimming pool, this hotel is amazing, the people are so kind and frendly nothing is to much trouble, everything is on a grand scale, from the moment you step out of your taxi to the moment you leave this place will stay with us for a long time, it is located 5 minutes walk from Orchard road, which is the main shopping and eating area of Singapore, the swimming pool which is about 5 degrees below the outside temperature is open till 10pm and we went for a swim at 9:30pm under the stars amazing. if you get the chance to go to Singapore stay at this hotel you will not be disappointed, we will definately be going back to this hotel when we next go to this side of the world.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely fabulous!\u201d", "Author": "Adele66", "ReviewID": "UR39731431", "Content": "I booked a room overlooking the pool in the Garden Wing.

Even though we received a great rate with favorable ammenities, I would have expected a larger room. Other thoughts on the room: - Nice bed - 3 pieces of fruit offered per day - nice touch. - 2 bottles of water at no charge (will provide more if asked). - Shower was a bit dated along with the rest of the bathroom. Not a huge deal though. - Can't turn on the bathroom lights in the evening because there is a fancy glass divider separating the room from the bathroom - hence anyone who is sleep, will be bothered by the light. - Door to bathroom and shower have awkward entrances. Bathroom door crowds bath area and shower door opens inward when the shower is already cramped enough. - Nice flat screen tv. Limited channels to watch, but you should be out exploring anyways. - A/C works very well. - Wierd lighting system from the different wall mounts that work sometimes and other times drive you crazy. On to the rest of the hotel. With the rate we received, breakfast was included. We had the choice to either dine at a restaurant called the Line or the Horizon Club lounge/The Blu. Both had excellent breakfast buffets and the attendants/chefs/waiters/etc, were all very helpful and courteous. The difference between the two is that the Line is a larger brunch location with more variety, but has a busier atmosphere compared to the Horizon Club lounge/The Blu where it's a lot quieter and private but a smaller variety of food. I recommend both of them depending on how you feel in the morning. I will say that the Horizon Club/The Blu has a great view from atop of the hotel as you eat. Some of the other great features of the hotel that we recognized are listed below: - They have a great gym with various cardio equipment, all in one type weight machines, smith machine, and free weights. I was impressed. - Pool is excellent for children and adults. Has two child pools that are great for your little ones. - Always many staff members around to help you at a moment's notice. Very helpful and courteous staff. On one occasion, we ordered room service and they sent up the wrong order for my wife and my portion. They didn't charge us for our son's meal and corrected the order promptly. Now, I will remind you that this is a five star hotel so you will run into those who believe they are more important than everyone else and they act accordingly. My wife and I didn't let them get to us and just smiled and kept going. Again, I am talking about hotel guests, not the staff. As I read before we came, this hotel is near the Orchard shopping area. It's about a ten minute walk, but not a bad walk at all. Before we came, we read about the walk and thought we would be walking a great deal, not the case at all.

The hotel entrance is stunning, and check in was very quick, with friendly staff on reception. We were on the 14th floor, in a room with a pool view. The room was lovely, with a huge bed and a lovely bathroom. We had tea making facilities, with a nice selection of teas, which we used, not however the mini bar or snacks, as they were so expensive (e.g \u00a33.50 for a Kit-Kat). Bathroom had very nice complimentary products, lovely fluffy white towels, robes and slippers. We'd read reviews saying it was very expensive to eat at the hotel, so we didn't eat breakfast there. However, complimentary fruit was left in our room every day, and we started our day by eating that with a cup of tea/coffee. The hotel has a courtesy bus to take you to Orchard Rd, which we used a couple of times, but it's not too far to walk, with the heat though, you need to stroll! We thought Orchard Road was lovely, it felt safe, and was just full of life. There is a large shopping mall near the MRT called the Wisma Atria, the food court (food republic) upstairs is great, we had some lovely meals there, really yummy, and not expensive. On our first night we went on the MRT which is great. We didn't buy any kind of travel pass, we just bought tickets as we needed them. When looking at the travel map, a local quickly offered help, seeing us looking a bit unsure, and we thought the Singaporeans were really lovely. Having chosen your destination it tells you how much it is e.g $2.20 and you pay an extra dollar, which you get a refunded after your journey. The MRT is very clean and easy to get around. We visited Clarke Quay, and thought is was very nice, but we had a drink in the Highlander, which was very expensive, 2 small Tiger beers (to make a pint) for hubby, and glass of orange (well half a glass, and loads of ice cubes) for me, cost $43.50!!! Over \u00a320... Husband nearly fell over. Visited botanical gardens (free) which was pleasant, and later that day got the train, followed by a bus to the night safari zoo. Arrived at 7.50 and were a bit fed up when paying entrance fee, as the girl asked us whether we'd flown with Singapore airlines (which we had) but we didn't have our boarding cards. Would have been a bit cheaper. As it was, it cost $64 ($32 each), and we queued from 7.50p.m to 9.20p.m.( one and a half hours) for tram. Tram ride was pleasant, but only 40 minutes, so by 10p.m it was all over and we left, all in all with the long journey there and back not really worth it. We also visited China town, where we had the only meal we didn't enjoy. As my husband had served in the British Royal navy in the 60's, he'd been based in Singapore. We took a train to Sembawang, and a taxi to see if there was anything in the area my husband recognised, a sort of nostalgic trip, but there was nothing, it has changed so much. No little Kampong villages, all modern highrise flats, and malls. We also went to Sentosa, not on cable car. We made a mistake here. We remembered our boarding cards this time, and somehow found we could get there using Singapore airline bus (so we thought). Got on the bus in Orchard Rd, there was quite a long wait. Told we would have to change buses, can't remember which way round, but we had to change at Suntec city, and little India. So 3 buses, and a good 20 minute wait for each, so took ages to get to Sentosa. Once there we had a really nice meal at Coasts and enjoyed the gardens and sights of Singapore museum. On the Singapore airlines bus on the return, there was only us and 2 girls. They were more clued up, they had a map showing bus stops, we picked a stop nearest to our hotel, and the return from Sentosa only took about 20-25 minutes, a fraction of the time it had taken to get there. So we made a few little mistakes, as learners do, will know next time! All in all we had a fabulous holiday in Singapore, the wonderful hotel, wonderful people and yummy food. Would love to go again. From there we went on to Bali (will put post on about that) Fantastic.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Camberley, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Valley Wing!\u201d", "Author": "fudgiesfriend", "ReviewID": "UR30018541", "Content": "Recently returned from a stay here on route to the Maldives and it surpassed our expectations.

Here to celebrate a pre-Mothers' Day family lunch. Despite it being a Singapore public holiday and also a Saturday, the staff were full of smiles. The food was good as usual. With the various live cooking stations, there was plenty of options for everyone. I was really relieved that the background music wasn't loud. Previous times I came, there were occasions where me and my guests didn't feel too good due to the loud music. This time, the ambience was a lot better. I have a recent tripadvisor review posted under The Line. Check-in: After lunch, half of our group left the hotel for their own activities. The rest of us had booked for an overnighter under a Mothers' Day package. We had tried to check in before noon but the rooms weren't ready. Claudia at Front Office was terrific. She had offered to let us have a look at one of the Tower Wing Executive Rooms (Exec) to help us decide whether we wanted to upgrade or stick to the Deluxe Room. We were very lucky that there was a room for viewing. She tried her best to accommodate families on the same floor. And during lunch, she even personally popped into The Line downstairs to pass us the room keys! In the end, some of us stuck to Deluxe Rooms whilst the rest upgraded for a fee. The Rooms : The Deluxe and the Exec: Difference is the bathroom toiletries, the sofa and added desk for business. The Exec has one additional enclosed balcony so that meant that both my hubby and I have our own private reading niches complete with very cozy armchairs. Turndown service in the evening included 2 bookmarks, a change of all used towels and placement of hotel bedroom slippers beside the bed. Switches are all at touch panel beside the bed. Convenient. Btw, the bedroom slippers are super comfy and padded but if your partner is a sound sleeper, bring your own cos the hotel slippers do make a noise when you walk about in them. Horizon Club Lounge: Now 6 of us had Horizon Club access and was it worth it! It meant that any time we wanted, we could go up to the lounge and get a drink. Finger food available 6-8pm daily was so delicious that some of us skipped dinner after having the seared tuna, cocktail prawns, mini smoked salmon buns etc. Even the biscuits for the cheese were very fresh and crispy. Drinks available included 7 types of juices, coffee, tea and during cocktail hour, wine was also free flow. Zul at the Horizon Club lounge provided very good and cheerful service. Free usage of internet was available with 3 computer stations and hardly anyone used them. The Pool: Huge pool. And plenty of deckchairs. Some secluded for peace and privacy (away from the noise of children playing/swimming). And the towels have been designed not to fall off the deckchair. Though the pool towels are not very moisture absorbent. You may wanna bring down the towel from the hotel room if you plan on swimming. And once in a while, the pool crew comes by with rolled up face towels that have been chilled. Very refreshing. This time round, the weather was so hot, we were even offered fresh pineapple slices to cool us down. Breakfast: Additional venues such as the Waterfall Terrace, Garden Terrace were available because it was Mothers' Day when we awoke. However, I propose you go to The Line for a proper breakfast cos minor details such as butter for the bread, light soy sauce, pepper and salt shakers were omitted. The staff of course was helpful but i guess the place wasn't equipped. In the end, we headed for the Blu restaurant reserved for Horizon Club and oh, we should have gone there in the first place. I mean, the Belgian waffle was incredible. It came with oats and maple syrup. Fresh blueberries and raspberries and a side of whipped cream. Yummy!! Even the standard breakfast items were up a notch. I'd upgrade just for the breakfast at the Blu. And Simon was also another cheery staff. Checkout: Very speedy. And we were given complimentary parking coupons which would have otherwise cost us each S$12 for the 2 days we were there.

Impressive arrival and the room was exceptional but were just a little concerned that the Tower Wing room did not have a balcony were we could sit and relax early mornings and in the evenings. After 2 days we found the Tower a little too closed in and thanking the hotel greatly for their offer asked if we could go back to the original plan and move to the Garden Room. No problem but you wont get the cocktails free as this is part of the Horizon Club. Shame but no big problem. We then asked about the complimentary breakfast, NO you wont get that either. Now the cocktails I kind of understand, the Horizon Club is in the Tower Wing and is there for those guests but the breakfast made no sense. I asked why they had upgraded us in the fist place the response was because you had booked 7 days and were a valued guest but it appears your only valued in the Horizon Club. I argued if I was valued why are you taking away the complimentary breakfast as it made no sense. This clearly threw them but still they continued to refuse it was back to the garden room with no breakfast for you matey. Still bemused by the hotels claim of being valued I had one last try. I asked to see the Manager. The young lady on the front desk asked the purpose and I told her my issue. No problem of course you can have a complimentary breakfast Sir your a valued guest. I just dont get these places at times and as with the Rasa Sentosa they seem to try and make you feel welcomed but then somehow they seem to mess it up by not following through, Its a great hotel very well kept and our Garden Room with balcony was just want we wanted but I do find the place just outrageous with its costs. One evening we came back and ordered 2 coffees in the longe and was presented with a bill for 37 singapore dollars. I guess they have to recover the costs of those complimentary breakfasts from somewhere! Overall great place but if like me you dont like paying 37 dollars for 2 coffees I am told there are just as good hotels around in Singapore that are a little more reasonable.

We decided on this hotel as we stayed at Naumi Hotel for 5 nights on the way out where we saw and did everything we had planned then. Our 2 nights at the Shang were pretty much for R&R plus they guaranteed an 8 pm check-out for us which was fantastic as we were travelling with our baby son. We arrived at the Airport to be collected by a driver who took us direct to the hotel. We were met immediately by staff and taken straight to the Garden Wing. We received a complimentary upgrate to room 585 which was the Garden Suite. Huge room with separate living area. The room I think was slightly dated but sptolessly clean with a great bathroom and lovely L'occitane goddies. We also received some tea and fruit which were complimentary. As we did not arrive until 10 pm we put baby to bed and fell asleep ourselves. I read reviews on breakfast and was really looking forward to it. We were not disappointed. The spread and choice was absolutely fantastic. The food was also very fresh (I find at some hotels the food has been made earlier in the morning and looks and tastes that way!). We ate just about a little bit of everything but I particularly enjoyed dim sum and they also served the most delicious yoghurt I have ever tasted! We enjoyed breakfast so much we decided to give dinner a go. I don't mind a dinner buffet but my husband does prefer table service in the evening but with the quality of breakfast he gave it a shot. Again, not disappointed. Food was fantastic. I was concerned about the price of everything in Singapore, particularly for alcohol - we are not big drinkers but a couple of beers and a glass of wine of an evening on holiday are pretty common for us - drinks prices are expesive - not just at the Shangri-la but everywhere. The Shangri-la take $19.20 for a beer which is around \u00a39 and the same for a glass of wine. If you are at the pool during the day take a look at the digital screen above the bar area as they detailed the current specials on for the time we were there. For instance on one night the buffet came with unlimted local wine, beer and juice for $88.00. We ate on the second day poolside. Just sandwiches and these were pretty standard - nothing really special. The pool attendants were around but didn't pester or bother you but were on hand if you needed them. The frequently brought us jugs of iced water during the day. Poolside foot massages are also availalbe and although I didn't take on I think I heard a rate of $57 for half an hour. The pool is super which a great area for children. I can't however see how they would cope if the hotel was full as there are just not enough loungers. Towels are provided and there is a stand with magazines etc for you to borrow or leave behind for other readers. I used the spa as a treat for my birthday. Very, very expensive but a good relaxing couple of hours spent in there - be warned though they will try and offer you additional treatments during your massage or facial - my therapist wanted me to take an eye treatment at the cost of $125 for 15 minutes! Just be prepared and say no if you want to. I used the business centre to catch on on banking. All very pleasant and I wasn't rushed to finish what I was doing either. Limo took us back to the airport. All in an excellent stay. Part of me does wish we stayed at the Shangri-la at the start of our trip but I do think having to take a taxi in the heat to get anywhere from the hotel would have annoyed me so still pretty sure we made the right decision with Hotel Naumi.

Now this is surprising given it is an old property and also one with sub-par location. Nestled away from the bustle of Orchard Road, the hotel is difficult to reach on foot. Having stood its ground as the top hotel amongst the newer rivals such as the St. Regis and the Ritz despite such flaws, Shangri-La Singapore (hereafter SS) is still the ultimate symbol of refined luxury for business travelers and tourists alike. So how do they do this? I have stayed here four times \u2013 three at the club room (called the Horizon Club). Firstly, one would never guess that SS is several decades old upon entering the rooms. Smart lighting highlights the textures of rich wooden furniture and plush carpets. The view is soothing & is to die for. As for amenities, it has everything you would expect. Big LCD TV, separate shower with two sinks, speakers in the bathroom, steam iron, big cushy sofa etc. Many hotels in Singapore disappoint their guests upon entering the rooms as they are typically less grandeur compared to the lobbies. SS is an exception \u2013 the rooms escalate your senses upon entering and put you at the center of luxury. Now this is not to say that the lobby of SS is any less overwhelming \u2013 far from it! What the smaller hotels try to achieve with style & design, SS achieves with magnificence. You actually feel \u2018smaller\u2019 standing at the lobby with extreme high ceilings and wall decorations that are the size of their standard rooms. The service is professional, although at times feels less \u2018personal\u2019. Their procedures in interacting with guests have been very \u2018standardized\u2019 that at times you actually feel like speaking to robots. The service is also inconsistent. Those seated by the elevators at the Garden Wing, I thought, were very unfriendly (during all four visits) while those at the Club Lounge were exceptional every time. Perhaps this is a given as the lounge will welcome much higher-valued guests, but the gap should never be this huge. The breakfast at SS is something you have to experience to believe. You will need a good 5 minutes to walk around to see all the foods available. They have everything from saut\u00e9ed mushrooms to fresh Kimchi! (I\u2019m Korean btw). The foods at the lounge are plentiful and the staffs approach you frequently to refill your drinks. No issues with bringing guests into the Lounge unlike some other hotels. The swimming pool is also bliss \u2013 although choosing the wrong time to swim will put you amongst a throng of children. All in all, one of the best hotels I\u2019ve stayed in although a bit on the expensive side. Choose this hotel to reward yourself with a luxurious atmosphere that does not disappoint.

One afternoon we treated ourselves to the champagne trio, which is 3 large glasses of Veuve Cliquot - the original yellow label, rose and the vintage, each came with canapes. It was delicious! Blu is in the 24th floor and has great views over the city. We didnt eat here, but relaxed on the balcony with a glass of champagne looking out at the city lights. The pool area and gardens are lovely and very well maintained. If you ask any locals what the top hotel is they will tell you its the Shangri La and we can see why, its simply faultless!

We were on a Bed and Breakfast tariff and found the breakfast in the 'Line Restaurant' fantastic, a really world wide food selection and brilliant service. We did not eat in other than breakfast as we were exploring Singapore. The one area we were disappointed with was the less than expected service around the poolside. The pool itself was very nice but unlike the Mandarin Oriental in Kuala Lumpar which is also 5 star, you had to chase after your own towels and there was no iced water nor attentive staff. We found some great restaurants at Boat Quay and Clarke Quay and in China town had a fantastic meal in Da Dong (Smith St). Overall Singapore is expensive and the Shangri la is very expensive (cup of tea by the pool \u00a37.50 - we only had that once! ) but it is a five star hotel, awash with staff and that is what you are paying for. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the top of Orchard Road and 15 minutes from the nearest tube, Singapore is a lovely clean city with lots to see.

If you are thinking about it, think no more. I would highly recommend it. It's certainly expensive but it's well worth it. The place is awesome. I stayed there one night with my wife and two young children. It was the perfect place. The staff is amazingly friendly, efficient, and professional. The property is beautiful, and the restaurants are second to none. We stayed in the Valley Wing. I'm sure all the rooms are nice, but book a room in the Valley Wing if you can. You pay more for the Valley Wing rooms but you also get so much more. There are snacks and refreshments throughout the day and breakfast at the Line is complimentary if you stay in the Valley Wing. I noticed that the bill at the Line was about $90 for 2 adults after service charges and etc. Again, the Valley Wing is expensive but the package included that $90 breakfast plus snacks, drinks, butler service, and a beautiful room. I believe there's a separate breakfast room when you stay in the Valley Wing. However, we ate at the Line because it was more suitable for a casual family breakfast. The food at the Line is superb. It was breakfast, but it resembled lunch buffets provided at other hotels. The variety of food would please anyone. We also spent some time at the pool. Again, it was a great place to relax and ideal for adults as well as children. The pool area felt like you were in a tropical resort because of the beatiful trees and garden that surround it. The pool was large and there's also a children's pool attached to the main pool. As for the hotel's location, it's a little distant from Orchard Road but there's a shuttle service provided by the hotel. The shuttle runs on a timetable and it stops at the Trader's Hotel, then at the Orchard MRT, and finally near one of the shopping malls further down Orchard Road before it loops back to the Shangri La. We took the shuttle to Orchard Road and walked back. The walk can be tiring, but it's not too bad. It should take less than 10 minutes. In any event, the way to get around in Singapore is the taxi, and there were always plenty lined up at the hotel enterance. We stayed at Shangri La for a family vacation. It was perfect for us, but Shangri La would be suitable for any type of traveler. The hotel is very accomodating. Shangri La is the best in Singapore.

The Shangri-La has a nice check in policy of showing you immediately to your room. This was much appreciated and is a very nice feature. The hospitality specialist that handled our check-in was professional and efficient. Our room was spacious with a great view of Singapore and everything looked updated on the surface. Nice bed linens and comfy bed. The vanity area was set up well with a hair dryer...very convenient arrangement. If you look closely though, things are worn and a little dirty...much like the rest of the hotel. There was a substantial amount of mold in the shower. We were brought some tea right away which was nice and two plums which were were mealy so we tossed them. Walking around the hotel we noticed an odd smell which we were never able to place and we didn't like. Lunch at the cafe was extremely pricey and mediocre. Even by \"hotel food\" standards. Service was slow and unfriendly. The dessert bar area is a nice touch and we purchased some excellent chocolates. The counter person there was very nice and helpful. The pool area is fabulous and is the reason to stay here. It is great for kids with a several areas of varying depths. Pool area had lush greenery and beautiful fountains. The jacuzzi could be warmer but the jets were great. We checked out the Blu bar on the top floor of the the hotel which has incredible views. The restaurant manager was very friendly. Very pricey but really, you can't beat the view. Overall, the vibe of the hotel seems to cater to older travelers or people on business trips where family comes along. This may not be fair, but after the hip fresh D2 in Chiang Mai where we had just came from this hotel seemed stodgy and did not positively compare. This may just be our demographic.

Other posts have mentioned that their rooms had recently been renovated, I can only assume they hadn\u2019t done ours yet. One other comment about the room, although not a major issue, is that it didn't have a separate shower as mentioned on the website room description. We booked directly with the hotel, their website gives different package options and they say they won\u2019t be beaten on price. We decided to go with the club room and glad that we did when we found out the price of food and drink at the hotel, and outside for that matter. We took breakfast in the Blu restaurant on the club floor, this was excellent with plenty of choice with the buffet and a la carte menu - and the fried eggs were cooked exactly to order, not an easy thing apparently judging by the other hotels we stayed at on this trip! If not included in the price, breakfast costs SG$40 a person. All the staff on the club floor were very pleasant, attentive and would help with anything you asked for. We did make the most of the club lounge and went to the early evening cocktail drinks each night. I\u2019m glad we did as the first night we went to an outside restaurant, nothing grand, a can of Guinness cost SG$18. We also found out later that the cocktails in the hotel were SG$25 a go, so the additional cost of the club lounge well and truly paid for itself. We also tried some of the local food outside the hotel. We ate at the Maxwell hawker centre in Chinatown, limited choice of mainly chicken and rice but food was excellent and cheap at SG$3 a meal. The lady concierge at the hotel recommended a good roti pratta caf\u00e9 near River Valley Road, fantastic! It was a true locals place and the roti and chicken curry were excellent and less than SG$10 for two. Overall the service and staff at the hotel were very good and the hotel is in a convenient location within walking distance to the shops, restaurants and bars of Orchard road as well as the MRT.

Next I have to mention that although the pool is very inviting there are nowhere near enough sunbeds so we have the ridiculous situation of bagging the beds with a towel and a book early in the morning even though you might not want to swim until the afternoon. When we enquired at the Customer Relations desk if they could come up with a solution they simply told us you have to get there early. In a 5 star hotel this foolishness should be solved by buying about 100 more beds, stacking them somewhere so no one needs to bag a bed. The staff apart from the Customer Relations person????? are unfailingly pleasant and anxious to please. Service is a bit hit and miss at times - dirty towels not removed from the room, running out of breakfast food at Blu but everyone seems to be working hard to make your stay a good one. Unlike many reviewers I find the menu at Line somehow \" not what you want\" and a bit limited. At the Park Hyatt down the road they have a much better grip on it in my view.

Say Orange Grove Road and Tanglin to many people and they will look at you with slight bemusement. That\u2019s unless they have stayed at the Shangri-La Singapore because that is where you\u2019ll find this luxury hotel tucked away just a few minutes off Orchard Road. The Shangri-La is slightly odd in one sense in that it gives you the feeling that you are in a destination resort and at the same time wrapped up in sophisticated opulence. Delightfully odd! True, the time before my most recent visit happened to coincide with a major international security conference whose attendees included the US Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates. Suffice it to say that security was tight! However that didn\u2019t affect my feelings about the hotel. Far from it! The ease with which this complex, high profile event was managed with only minor inconvenience for people like me speaks volumes. From the time you arrive at the hotel you will encounter some of the best hotel staff to be found anywhere in the world. The brightly costumed and incredibly polite guys who open your car door tend to rather be outshone by the graceful and beautifully dressed young ladies who will greet you with a smile and warmth that will melt any jet-lag. The front desk staff are the definition of efficiency and really make you feel like you are the only guest in the hotel. In my experience no request is too large and there is never that sense of \u201cplease don\u2019t ask me \u2026 ask the other person \u2026 it\u2019s their job\u201d that one sometimes finds in large hotels. The lobby is a large expanse of cream colored marble with tall columns leading your eye to enormous crystal chandeliers. Off to one side you will find a lounge area with comfortable chairs and sofas and is a good place for coffee and meeting people for business discussions. Order a cappuccino and you will receive a terrific cup of coffee delivered with four choices of flavors that will be stirred into your drink before your very eyes. A very nice touch! From the lobby you will either be shown to your room in the Tower Wing or will be taken to the Garden Wing of the hotel. The Valley Wing has a separate entrance and as I have yet to stay in this part of the hotel, I will leave it to those lucky people to describe that part of the Shangri-La! The Garden Wing rooms are large and airy with a d\u00e9cor that is somewhat reminiscent of destination resort in style. Mine overlooked the large pool and had a flower festooned balcony on which I happily whiled away the odd free hour. The Tower rooms are not quite as spacious but have (I think) been relatively recently renovated. The bathrooms are excellent with both a walk in shower and bath tub and are separated from the living area by a wall of glass blocks that make the space feel light and spacious. Add to that the ubiquitous toiletries and soft fluffy towels and bathrobes and you may have found your bathroom heaven (well that may be over stating the case a bit!!). Many people will visit the \u201cLine\u201d restaurant for breakfast, lunch or dinner. True, it isn\u2019t inexpensive but it is an unusual experience where one can select food from various \u201cstations\u201d spread around the restaurant. It is difficult to explain, which I have clearly just demonstrated!! Anyway, it\u2019s worth a try. \u201cBlu\u201d is set atop of the Tower Wing and has wonderful food, a great bar with excellent cocktails and occasional live music. Whenever I have been there it has been quiet and relaxing and a haven from the crowds at Boat or Clarke Quay or the various Orchard Road \u201chaunts\u201d. Singapore for me is like a second home. I adore the people, the food and even the weather! I used to stay at the Hyatt but I really enjoy the Shangri-La. OK it may not have the \u201cedginess\u201d of newer hotels or the colonial grandeur of Raffles but it has everything I need on my trips with one added luxury; the smile that comes from staff who either really enjoy what they do or are unbelievably well trained \u2026 or maybe it\u2019s both.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "North East England", "Title": "\u201cTreated Like Royalty\u201d", "Author": "topcop999", "ReviewID": "UR20811182", "Content": "We decided to have a 3 day stop in Singapore whilst en route to Cairns, Australia for our Honeymoon Sept 2008. As it was a special occasion we decided to treat ourselves to a 5 star hotel and as it was only 2 nights, the cost was manageable. We paid about \u00a3250 per night for a Garden Wing Room which although we didn't request, did overlook the pool; what a bonus. Tower wing rooms are cheaper. I was thrilled to bits with the service from landing at the airport. We booked a limousine pickup through the hotel and upon exiting the airport which wasn't at all crowded like some arrivals areas; we were met by an immaculately dressed female with our name on a board. She promptly ushered a driver across and both took our luggage. We were given a guided tour of the city en-route to the Shangri La by a very knowledgeable driver. The limo was immaculate, air conditioned and free bottled water available. (I think the pickup cost was around \u00a345 - well worth it for such a treat) Taxi\u2019s even cheaper and the MRT mentioned later runs right into the airport. Upon arrival at the Shangri La, a reception committee awaited and again we didn't have to touch our luggage. Another wonderful receptionist called Cherlyn ushered us to our wonderful spacious room in the garden wing, closely followed by our luggage. We didn't even have to attend the desk to check in - it was all done in our room within seconds. From landing at the airport we were in the room within 55 minutes! We took advantage of a very comfortable and large bed to catch up on a little sleep before admiring the large pool and Jacuzzi in the gardens. The pool was open until 22:00 hours and just the right temperature. Each day we had fresh fruit in the room, on the second day a lovely decorative heart made from petals on the bed and two roses on the pillows. They also sent us a cake congratulating us on our honeymoon which I only mentioned at the time of booking, 7 months prior. Normally Hotels of this grandeur become so enveloped in their own success they forget about minor details such as this which really meant a lot. Every staff member was courteous and friendly and couldn\u2019t do enough to help. This must be what makes the Shangri La stand out above the rest. If I had one criticism only, it would be that the price of the drinks and food in the various restaurants around the hotel was beyond our normal budget. I am sure though that this hotel is really geared up for those earning slightly more than we do. That aside I would still return and remember, you don\u2019t necessarily have to eat there \u2013 just enjoy the splendour of the rooms, pool, service and ambience of the hotel in general. Upon venturing out, it was quite humid and I would recommend shorts and T shirts unless you are eating at the Shangri La. (Long trousers and a shirt more suitable) The Shangri La is situated just five minutes walk from Orchard Road and only ten to fifteen minutes to the Orchard MRT station \u2013 mentioned later. I would suggest a copy of the Berlitz pocket or Rough Guides guide to Singapore; very concise and informative. It is worth looking up when the festivals are happening and booking to suit these dates. Singapore being multicultural often has Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim festivals. When we were there it was Hindu Deepavali (Festival of lights) everything was colourful and pretty in Little India. Singapore has a fantastic MRT (Mass Rapid Transport) underground system. It is very cheap, clean, air conditioned, graffiti free and trains run every 2 to 6 minutes until midnight. Many stations have a ticket booth where you can buy an EZ Card. (Orchard Road has one) Basically you charge the EZ card with an amount of cash and simply swipe it upon entering and exiting your relevant stations. We put the equivalent of \u00a37.50 on a card and didn't even use half of it in 3 days despite going everywhere on the MRT. Some bus routes also allow the EZ card to be used. The MRT stations have a map available to assist you in getting around. Singapore has many areas worthy of viewing, Little India, Chinatown, Raffles Plaza, Clarke Quay, Marina Bay, Jurong Bird Park, Sentosa Island (Via cable car from Harbour MRT station) In Little India we went to a great restaurant called Komala Vilas, 76 Serangon Road for a lunch time THALI BIRYANI. As it is mainly Hindu, much of the food is vegetarian. I was amazed that beetroot curry could taste so wonderful!. At this restaurant we ate our THALI (A sample mixture of curries, pickles, rice and chapatti) from a banana leaf with our \u2018right\u2019 hand, just like and with the locals, all for around \u00a34. I also recommend the delicious mango lassi (Yoghurt/fruit smoothy). Eat upstairs, it is less crowded. Onto Chinatown, look out for Smith Street where there are around ten stalls selling freshly cooked Chinese noodles, fish, shells and meat dishes for as little as \u00a32. You find a seat, go up to any counter you wish and it is cooked immediately in front of you in minutes. Again, clean and full of locals and culture. The Buddhist temple is well worth a visit \u2013 be careful not to be scantily clad. If you fancy a little more upmarket then there are various 'food courts/hawker centres' dotted around. They are all open late and are very clean with a cleanliness grading system from A to D (Government run cleanliness initiative) I recommend the food court near to NEWTON MRT station. It is open late, has a very good range of MALAYAN, THAI and CHINESE food, obviously fresh and served with lovely cold TIGER beer at around \u00a33.50 per large bottle. We had chilli squid and huge grilled prawns for around \u00a38 \u2013 never had squid so fresh and tender. If you want even more upmarket air conditioned food courts they are located in the big shopping centres off Orchard Road and at HARBOUR MRT. No doubt they are more upmarket but for me they lack local ambience and are pricier due to their locations. I found little difference in the food. Orchard Road is a shopper\u2019s paradise, though I doubt there are any bargains to be had. Everything is already priced up and bartering for goods only really takes place in the Markets in Little India and China town. Be sure to have a look round all stalls before you commit. Prices can be three times less on a neighbouring stall. Clarke quay is the place to be at night for late pubs, disco\u2019s and gourmet eateries. No doubt it is quite pricey compared to the food courts and don\u2019t be surprised to be paying \u00a38 per alcoholic drink. In Singapore however the choice is yours, you can do it on a budget, or split down the middle as we did. We even ate at raffles Long Bar with our Singapore Sling \u2013 the food was cheaper than the cocktails! The Swisshotel is well worthy of a visit near Raffles Plaza. After 3pm the bar on 71st floor opens and the views are amazing, right across to Malaysia. You can just go up to admire the view and play in the high speedlift, but it would be good manners to buy a drink for that free view! All in all I wish I had booked a week or more there, I could have definitely filled it and I will be back. (Most definitely at Shangri La) No need for jumpers and coats, just brolleys in case it rains. If it does, it is however nice rain, warm and normally over in an hour. We spent around \u00a3200 in 3 days and did\u2019t go hungry!! Enjoy!!

The pool really deserves special mention. The staff were wonderfully courteous; bringing guests fresh towels, a cold facecloth, a complimentary non-alcoholic cocktail. We spent many, many hours relaxing in and by the pool. It is truly wonderful. We also ate in the hotel's Chinese restaurant \"Shang Palace\" which, as far as I can remember, was very nice.

As it was part of my honeymoon i emailed the hotel prior to let them know and on arrival we were met at the airport (i had booked a transfer in a hotel car prior to arrival) and infomed that we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a 1 bedroom Suite in the Valley Wing (i had booked a tower wing horizon club premier room to start with)..Check in was brief and carried out in our suite by our personal butler and we were informed of all of the benefits of the Valley wing itself, too many to mention here. Complimentary champagne was available on tap at any time of the day or night in the valley wing lobby along with numerous sandwiches etc and breakfast was taken in the private summit room although we tended to opt for the line restaurant (great food and impeccable restaurant design). On a couple of nights we had cocktails in Blu, the bar at the top of the tower wing with great views over singapore. The pool area was great and generally quiet with pool staff tending to our every need. Ignore some reviewer's comments about the location of the hotel, it is about 5 minutes walk maximum from Orchard Road and taxis are everywhere if you don't fancy the walk. I had also read reviews saying that the location in Singapore was relatively out of the way for tourist spots, well i suppose it is but if you look at the fact that it is in a quiet corner of the city out of the way of the hustle and bustle..that is a positive rather than a negative, and when a taxi costs no more than \u00a34 each way to get you to Raffles or indeed, anywhere else, i would say it's a no-brainer. I think it is also important to mention that this hotel is the flagship of a large luxury asian hotel company and as such, the design is pure asian...i think that this is something that is missed in all of the other large american hotels (four seasons etc) and is an important part of the ambience of the hotel, when in Rome, do as the Romans if you know what i mean. I could have stayed in the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton but they are just too generic. As a conclusion, i would say that having spent a good ammount of time at the hotel in those 3 days, i would easily class it as one of the best i've stayed in, the facilites are second to none and the staff are only too happy to help you in any way.

I overindulged so much just at breakfast because it was so irresistable and never ever had to eat lunch while I was there. Moet champagne was free flowing and complimentary every day and the waiters were always around ready to top your glass up or tempt you with a cocktail of some sorts. Sandwiches and afternoon tea were always served every afternoon and between 5 and 7 you always got a little plate of beautiful canapes to accompany your drink!

This is a very good hotel with a lot of nice touches. On arrival we were greeted by friendly staff dressed in traditional costumes and led into a cool (compared to outside), large marble lobby. The staff made us feel very welcome and offered us an upgrade to their Horizon Club option, at 100SD per night extra. For this you get to have compilmentary breakfast on the 24th floor with a nice view over city to the south west instead of the usual restaurant at the bottom of the hotel, a room upgrade and compilmentary beverages all day. Also on the 24th floor there is a business centre including internet which the upgrade gave us free access to and also an area where canapes and cocktails are served between 6pm and 8pm. All free to Horizon Club patrons. An option I absolutely recommend. The cocktails served were very nice, the wines exceptional and the canapes simply delicious. The rest of the hotel facilities were excellent. Really nice pool area and fitness centre and if you walk round the pool area and look close enough there is a water fall/stream they've created which you can walk up. The room was really nice and there was more than enough space for the two of us. Everything was clean and well kept. The location, although out of the way was good (in my opinion) as its on a quiet tree lined road a hundred yards or so from the busy Orchard Road. We used the bus tours a lot (two days for the price of one, bargain!) and the yellow route bus stop is at the end of Orange Grove Road. And if you don't use the buses, there are more taxis than you can shake a big stick at and they are very cheap. Here is the \"But\". On arrival we explained to the reception staff that as we would be leaving at 6am on our day of departure we would be unable to take of advantage of the compilmentary breakfast which is served from 6am onwards so we initially declined the offer of the Horizon Club upgrade. After consultation with the manager we were offered free room service to compensate. On the day of departure, a beautifully laid and served breakfast was delivered to the room at 5:15 (ish), however on examining the bill when we left, we were charged for the breakfast (my own fault for not checking the bill close enough, Doh!). Anyway, after a phone call from the airport and initial denials that a deal had been made over the breakfast, and then after having a conversation with the Reception manger of the Shangri La Rasa Ria near Kota Kinanbalu (another fantastic Shangri La hotel) two weeks later who was very helpful, we were refunded for the room service. I put this down to a lack of communication and details lost in translation. This will not stop us from staying here again though.

On arrival we were very pleased and impressed by the atrium/lobby and reception; it was all very opulent and check in was quick. It was 2.00am in the morning so perhaps this wasn't surprising. We had booked a Tower, Club room which overlooked the garden and swimming pool. This was very luxurious but very, very small and we were disappointed. We had had 4 weeks of travelling and many club rooms, sometimes we even had been upgraded to a suite, this room was less half the size most of the other rooms and about a third of the size of the Sheraton at Noosa which we had just left. By this time it was about 2.30am so all we wanted was sleep and as we only had two nights there we decided not to complain. The bathroom was also very small but like the room was luxurious. We had breakfast at the Blu restaurant (Club room breakfast area). The view was fabulous and the choice and quality of the food excellent so we decided to book evening dinner here and a waitress made a note of our booking and request for a window table but as she couldn't make the reservation herself told us it would be confirmed later and we gave her our mobile number for this. No-one contacted us! At about 5.30pm we returned to Blu restaurant to check on the booking; although they had the note which clearly stated our request for a window table and time etc. they had done nothing about it. So at this late time we had to make the booking needless to say all the window tables had now been reserved! We said OK we didn't mind a table a little back from the window as we could still see the view. We went back to our room to shower and change and then to the Club lounge for pre dinner drinks and canap\u00e9s. It was about 6.45pm and we were stunned to be told there was no seating available so we would have to wait in the nearby Blu bar where our drinks would be brought to us. We went in here and with great difficulty (I am only 5ft 3\u201d) we climbed onto the very high chairs. We perched uncomfortably here waiting for our drinks - they didn't arrive!! . This bar is extremely cold, so much so that condensation had formed on the outside of all the windows and you couldn't see the fabulous view so this was not a good experience. Eventually my husband went to find the drinks only to be greeted by 'Oh, there is a seat for you now, didn't anyone tell you?' Well we finally got to the comfort of the Club lounge but only for a short time as we were now due to go for dinner. When we got to the Blu restaurant we were shown to table in an alcove (the only one without a view!). We protested to no avail! We should have left then but decided to stay and to be fair had a very excellent meal. I must say though don't go to this restaurant if you have a big appetite or a small wallet. Most of the next day we spent at the Botanic gardens, and then came back to the hotel for a welcome hour or two around the pool. This is lovely but, for the size of the hotel, too small and consequently it was very crowded with children everywhere and it was difficult to find two sun-beds. There is plenty of space for another pool in the grounds and I think the hotel would do well to do away with the tiny four hole par 3 golf and put in a second pool. Prior to our holiday I checked the website and was pleased to see that club rooms had a complimentary late check-out as we were flying at 1.30am (this influenced our booking). When we asked for this late check out we were told check out was at 12.00md. It took a lot of persuasion to get a change on this but finally they did relent and it was granted. I think the rules must have changed between booking and our stay. So, if you have stuck with me this far you may we wondering if we would stay here again. I am afraid the answer is that despite the obvious luxury and reputation of the hotel we would not. We were not made to feel special or a valued guest in any way, and next time would return to the Mandarin Oriental where we have stayed previously.

I lived in S'pore when I was younger, and have been to Singapore more times than I can count. However, this was the first time for my husband. More than anything I just want him to have a good experience. All I have to say is, the Shang have helped made my husband's first trip to S'pore enjoyable and memorable. The positive - Very warm greeting and service upon arrival and throughout the stay. - We booked the deluxe room at the Valley wing and they upgraded us to a suite, when they heard we were on our honeymoon. Also gave us a lot of free perks. - Great size, very well furnished, and great amenities. - Perfect location, 15 minute walk to Orchard. Close enough but not right in the middle of the craziness. I read someone wrote that it's a 30 minute walk....I'm not quite sure where they get that time from. - Great selection and quality of breakfast at the Line. Love it!! - Love the free Champagne and canapes on the lounge - The hotel staff is very friendly and always eager to help The negative - The concierge service is very inconsistent. Some of them are very knowledgeable and some of them have to keep on checking with other people for everything and unable to give you a straight answer. They also screwed up on one of our dinner reservations, but we were still able to get a table in the end...so no big deal. - The other breakfast room (other than the Line) called the Summit room?? or something like that. In any case, for the summit room, they do not allowed anyone wearing sandals or shorts. I find this to be a bit too much, too forced an effort to make the Valley Wing more posh than it already is. Don't get me wrong, my husband I always dressed up for dinner, no matter where we are in our travels. As a matter of fact we love dressing up. But for breakfast and lunch, especially if we're travelling in a hot + humid country and have a full day of walking and sightseeing ahead of us, we like to wear our sandals and shorts. It seems silly to make your guests dress up for breakfast, then they have to go back upstairs to change into their comfortable everyday clothes. To make long story short, we went to the line everyday for breakfast. Other than that, the Valley wing at the Shang is very impressive and beautiful. I recommend anyone in staying there, but be sure to book the Valley wing. The main wing is still nice, but looks exactly as it did in the 80s. It's in need of a face lift, especially compared to some of the newer and grander hotel around S'pore. But just as I remember it as a child, I still love the Shang!", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat Valley Wing, but was it perfect?\u201d", "Author": "pjkeay", "ReviewID": "UR14835846", "Content": "We recently enjoyed a 4 night stay at the Valley Wing at the Shangri La in Singapore. Overall we had a great stay BUT we had a couple of minor issues and one significant issue that necessitated us calling the hotel General Manager to resolve (a first for us). All credit to the hotel they went quite a way to sort the problem out and make recompense, more later. We arrived in Singapore after a great stay at the Rasa Sayang in Penang. We arrived at SIN at about 12.15pm and think we were in our taxi on the way to the hotel within 20 minutes. I recall we arrived at the Valley Wing lobby about 1310. Don't think we would have done it much quicker if we had booked the hotel limo service. We were ushered into the lobby by the doorman and asked to take seats. After about a minute we were greated by a guest relations officer who proceded to escort us directly to our room (1259). On the way she took time to explain to us the privillages of the Valley Wing - free drinks in the lobby from 1030am - 1030pm, snacks all day long, free use of the business centre including internet access. She also explained to us that one of the two lifts was being refurbished but we would be free to use the VIP elevator that takes you directly to the private VIP entrance of the Valley Wing. This, as it transpired, was very conveniant for us, because the VIP lift was very fast and was about 10ft from the door to our room. Each floor of the Valley Wing only has about 10 rooms on it, with each pair of rooms set back from the corridor allowing them to be paired up and shut off. The corridors are very quiet and despite being told that the hotel was virtually full we never saw a single person on the corridor (including any housekeeping trollys throughout our stay). Access to each floor by lift or stairs is only by key card. This is a hotel that has to take security seriously owing to the number of VIPs attending. There was an Asian PM in residence whilst we were there. But more about security later. We were surprised when we arrived at our room to find that housekeeping was still in attendence making up our room. Rather than being immediately allocated another room we were surprised that we were taken in, sat down on the sofa, amongst a scattering of pillows and bed covers and checked in. This was most disappointing and gave a perculiar first impression. If the room wasn't ready they should have found us another room or asked us to wait 10 minutes in the lobby and had a drink. The room itself was very impressive, measuring a good 50m2. Laid out in a fairly traditional fashion with what I would describe as very traditional european style decor of a seemingly very good quality. We were allocated a city view room, with a view that wasn't bad but it was a little disappointing to note that half of the rooms in the Valley Wing get an excellent view of the Hotel incinerator / boiler stack. The room came equipped with a large desk with personalised business cards and writing paper. My partner was a bit miffed that it was assumed that only I would require the use of such things (i didn't). I'm sure, had we asked, she would have received a stash. A large minibar (not free) featured a wide selection of wine, beer, premium brand spirits in large bottles and tasty chocolates. Disappointingly, the room only has a CRT TV. It does have a BOSE stereo and DVD player. There was no inhouse movie on demand - only the dire movie channel (Vision 4, I think - which has to be the worst movie channel ever) and HBO. The bathroom was large and decked completely in white marble making it very light but a little stark for my tastes. The so-called mood lighting was pretty naff, seeming to just switch a couple of lights off. The mood lighting in the bathrooms at the Peninsula in Bangkok was much better. The room featured a seperate toilet and Bidet, bath with TV, double sinks, and a reasonably large walk in shower. The shower featured a fairly naff and ineffective rain-head shower which could be switched over to a conventional shower which was okay, I've had much better showers elsewhere. There was a good selection of Aigner bathroom toiletries, replensished twice daily. The bottles were the same size as standard Shangri La toiletries (Unlike at the Horizon Floor at the Shangri La in KL, where 4 years ago they were twice the size). Overall the room was very well kitted out and in excellent shape. In the evening delicious home-made mint chocolates in little boxes are left Drinks service is in the Valley wing lobby, where, somehow the butlers know who is and who is not stopping in the wing. They very quickly work out what you like and by the second day most had worked out our names. The selection is pretty good with brand name spirits, Moet Champagne, and reasonably good French and New World Wines. A glass of this wine or champagne will set you back about \u00a310 in the main wing of the hotel, so you can see how the savings will add up. Breakfast is taken in the Summit Room, and consists of a small cold buffet followed by an A la carte selection cooked to order menu. However, the chefs will endevour took what you want when you want it - this extends to 24 hour room service. The only problem we noted was that the room cannot cope very well when there is a rush on. People were waiting in excess of 30 minutes for a table. You could dine in the main hotel buffet if you wished, which was good but very busy and noisy. The wing also has a small patio area reserved for Valley Wing guests. We found that the rules over whether you could eat and drink in this section seemed to depend on who you asked or maybe who you were. We were told you could take your own drinks outside but food wasn't allowed and there is no table service in that area (something to do with smoking rules) however we saw a couple of vocal business men barking orders to staff to bring them food and drink which they did The big problem - On the second night we left our room at 5pm and returned at 10.30pm to find that the housekeeper had left the door ajar when she had turned the room down. We immediately called the Duty Manager, My partner was very upset, I was just angry. The Manager and I checked the room and safe and confirmed from a preliminary inspection that nothing seemed to have been taken. The Manager promised to review all the security footage that night, all key entries to the room and the Head of security was ordered to interview the housekeepers. We arranged to see the General Manager the following morning. During our meeting with the General Manager he confirmed that the Housekeepers had been the only people to enter the room that night and he offered us the opportunity to view the security footage, which we declined. He was most appolgetic and said he had sent wine and chocolates to our room. He also offered us a compementary meal in the hotels top restaurant, BLU. Whilst we were extremly disapointed over the lapse in security at a hotel that prides itself on the issue we felt in the circumstances, and given the fact that nothing had been taken, the offer was more than reasonable. We later received a personal hand written letter from the Manager appologising. We also received VIP treatment when we took the manager up on his offer of a meal, with various hotel management coming over to introduce themselves to us and ensure we were having a good time. We didn't take the [-] with the courtersy offered with the free meal and only ordered a moderately priced Chablis (it was still \u00a340) but when we came to pay for the wine we were told that the Manager was picking up the complete cost. The hotel has excellent grounds with a wonderful pool. Be under no illusion that the Shangri La is a big hotel with several ballrooms and function rooms. When the hotel is full the main lobby area in the main wing can resemble a busy train station concourse. Considering the Valley Wing was only remodeled a couple of years ago I was surprised with the conservative layout of the bedroom, but maybe that's what the regulars like. Similarly, the lobby is very traditionally laid out, we would have preferred the lobby to have been broken up a little to be more like a lounge with perhaps a slightly more contemporary feel, it never really felt like you were sitting anywhere else than on a thoroughfare. These are minor observations and don't really detract from what is a great hotel to stay in Singapore. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. it wasn't perfect and perhaps at the prices it charges it should be. That said, the free drink on offer makes for tremendous value if you enjoy a drink. The rooms are very comfortable and the staff do seem to try very hard to make your stay special. __________________", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ENGLAND", "Title": "\u201cGREAT hotel BAD location\u201d", "Author": "SurferChick", "ReviewID": "UR14718556", "Content": "I booked the Shangri La based on the reviews on Trip advisor.

With alcohol being so expensive in Singapore, it really is a sensible option. Within the grounds of the hotel, are beautiful gardens. The hotel is justly proud of this, and even offers tours to those who are interested. There are several dining options, if you can't decide what you fancy like us try The Line.

The Asian service mentality, the eat-yourself-to-a-premature-grave-on-lovely-food-from-around-the-world breakfast, the pool and the reflexology are astoundingly good. There are some nice touches, such as a fresh cake in the room and the turn down service when they leave you a pot of jasmin tea. In some parts I think the hotel could do with a makeover, the upgrade options upon arrival (\"if you pay x dollars you can get this room, with breakfast in this special restaurant, or you could change to the other wing for x dollars\") reminded me of a second-hand car showroom and charging $10 for valet parking?

Our stay was fine - breakfast in The Line was fantastic, as was the buffet dinner there on our second night. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The main problem was on checking out - we had a voucher from Kuoni confirming 2 nights accommodation with breakfast - so we expected only to pay for the dinner on the second night. The hotel had been given a copy of this voucher on our arrival. My husband was duly presented with a bill for 2 nights stay, 2 breakfasts, dinner and $64 for 'telephone calls'. Of course my husband disputed this and the accommodation charge was quickly deleted. However, they said the telephone charge was for 'internet use'. We didn't have our pc with us and hadn't touched the phone for anything at all! The charge was grudgingly taken off the bill and we paid what we had expected to pay. However, my main grouch was that there was not a single word of apology from the reception staff about their error. This marred what had been a perfect holiday up to then - it left a rather bitter taste in the mouth, so to speak. Would I stay there again?

It turned out that the ASEAN summit was on at the same time and as lots of bigwigs were staying at the Shangri-la it was like a fortress getting in and out with airport type security scanners and police with guns patrolling outside. The lobby area was taken up with press people which made it feel more like a train station than anything else, and while I do believe the hotel did its utmost to help guests, it did spoil it somewhat. We paid \u00a3130 per night but thought it would be worth the experience of staying at the Shangri-la after reading the comments left by other travellers. First and foremost - the staff are amazing!

Staff remembered who we were (and with the amount of people there that was quite something!) and were very helpful. The hotel itself is really nice. The communal areas (lobby, pool etc) are outstanding. There are plenty of places to eat and a small gift shop. However, I was a bit disappointed with our room. We were upgraded to the Garden Wing which I had longed to book but was out of our price range. The pictures on the website looked so pretty with the balconies and the bougainvillaea. However, our room overlooked the carpark and the flowers were pretty dead. The room was fine but as a twin the beds were only a few inches apart. One of the electric sockets wasn't fixed to the wall properly. The bathroom was spacious with a good shower but not enough countertop space for toiletries. There was a small sofa and chair which was nice and a lovely touch was a pot of jasmine (I think) tea waiting for us as a welcome when we arrived. Fresh fruit was also left at no charge. We had breakfast in our room one morning which was excellent. We had journalists staying in the room adjoining and we found that the soundproofing could be better! My other comment about the Garden Wing is that the sound of the tropical waterfalls can be really noisy, especially with the birds in the morning!! The last thing about the hotel is the location - Its about 15 minutes walk from Orchard Road although there is a free shuttlebus that leaves every hour from the hotel and will drop you off at the MRT or by the malls. Doesn't sound like much but walking it in the heat is not that great! We stayed at Raffles the Plaza on the way out for 3 nights and to be honest, we would be more likely to stay there than go back to the Shangri-la. The hotel room felt more spacious and I preferred being more centrally located to shops and the MRT. Don't get me wrong - this is a great hotel and the fact that the ASEAN summit was on wan't their fault! And if you want to be looked after, you can't beat the staff. But in terms of rooms and location I think you can get better elsewhere.", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester UK", "Title": "\u201cA winner on the service\u201d", "Author": "ajhaeh", "ReviewID": "UR11685033", "Content": "We were met at Changi Airport by the pre booked hotel driver who delivered our tired and jet lagged bodies to the brightly lit front doors of the Shangri La Hotel\u2026 As soon as the side door of the carrier opened we were whisked away by our \u2018greeter\u2019 to be checked in.

A hair dryer was provided, safe, mini bar and fruit and ice were renewed daily. The turn down service left a poem on your pillow and the whole room electronics were operated through a \u2018control centre\u2019 at bed side.

That evening, before dinner, we went downstairs to the lounge for some free drinks. The lounge is beautiful, but we felt very out of place, as we were dressed in what I would call Smart Casual clothes, but everyone else there was dressed in Chanel and Prada and Gucci etc. We ate in the Line restaurant that night and had the buffet. It was amazing, so much choice, and very fresh, but for S$90 per person, you would hope that it was. It was worth it though, and we were on our honeymoon, so why not. We had breakfast one morning at the Line and one morning at the Valley Wing Summit Room. The Line was much more inviting and comfortable to us, as the Summit Room was a little too posh for us. The pool was probably the best that we have seen in Singapore, almost a resort feel, with lots of greenery and squirrels playing around in the trees.

The hotel had incorrectly cancelled our booking and not reinstated it even though I presented the voucher showing all the details. Unbeknown to my husband and I, instead of just using the credit card details they took for hotel incidentals, they took SGD1800 to cover our booking- even though I had booked and paid in full more than a year earlier. It was a full 24 hours later before they sorted the mess out and a cake and flowers were sent to our room- too late I'm afraid. To add to this, we stayed at the Tower wing for one night post cruise. We presented our vouchers for both accommodation and breakfasts, and were sent to our lovely room where roses, wine and cake were waiting. Lovely!

The staff were so friendly and the pool and gardens are magnificent. But\u2026\u2026!!! On Sunday the 18th November things changed dramatically. We discovered that the ASEAN Summit was to be held at our Hotel and our paradise very quickly became a prison. To get out of the hotel we had to fight our way through crowds of reporters and photographers in the lobby. To get into the Hotel was a nightmare with security inspecting every thing and every one. The Hotel and its surrounding area was heavily patrolled by armed police and the army personnel. Taxis\u2019 were reluctant to go through the security inspections to get to the hotel. We tried to work our activities around the shuttle bus only to find the Rasa Sentosa Resort/Shangri La Hotel shuttle that was advertised did not operate any more and on Monday evening the city shuttle was cancelled with out any prior warning. What did the hotel do to compensate its guest \u2013 you may ask? On the first 2 days of the Summit there was a team of hotel personnel who stood at the exit of the security screens. They came up and offered an obviously pre-instructed sincere \"apology for the inconvenience\" and that was it! With the taxi situation we were told rather secretively by the commissioner that he could be arranged a car for $25.00 for what we then found was only $6.70 taxi ride. The same guy also pushed a Limo service for an extra fee and slipped us a piece of paper with his name and number in it. Sunday pm I consulted reception with concerns about the environment we found ourselves in - hoping we could transfer to the Rasa Sentosa Resort (Shangri la) but was told that there was nothing they could do because we were booked through a travel agent. I did not pursue the matter as it was obvious the staff had bigger fish to fry and we just had to do the best we could. We have returned home feeling a little bitter from the experience.

I challanged the receptionist and they agreed to charge me for half a day. The Hotel is in general excellent. We stayed in the garden wing as my wife and i wanted a balcony. The room has everything you need, from toothpaste, cotton buds, sewing kit, shampoo, dressing gowns, slippers (some guests chose to wear these around the pool) tea + coffee, mini bar, you name it it was available and even if it wasn`t the hotel would have provided it for you. ( we asked for an extra sunbed on the balcony and it was there before i could say Boo) We had room service the first night, served on the balcony, the quality of service and the standard of the food was excellent. We slept in most days till lunch time (i blame the fabulous comfy beds) and the staff would always have our room made up late afternoon. There was also a turn down service. You can be served food and drinks around the pool all day and the food is brought to your sun lounger on a small table. The poolside staff also provide foot and full body massages and the pool is open till 10pm which is nice after you have been out all day There rerstraunts are always busy but are quite expensive, the quality and service are what you are paying for. The Blue bar on the top floor of the Tower wing is worth a visit, cocktails start about \u00a315 ahead but the view is outstanding. The gymnasium is ultra modern and has a great view of the pool. On the down side, the hotel has many function rooms and is used by buisnesses during the week and for weddings at the weekend, however this should not put you off as the intereference is minimal. Taxis are plentiful outside the hotel entrance. The hotel is situated at the top end of Orchard RD and Orchard Road is a short walk (10 min max). Here you will find many bars, restraunts and shops, every one you have at home and more. One recommendation to travellers is goto the Irish Bar Muddy Murphys, about a 12 min walk from the hotel (dont worry you are perfectly safe in Singapore to walk about at anytime) Great atmosphere, good food, the Guiness is outstanding (especially when its free on Halloween) I was in Singapore 13 years ago and prices then seemed extortionate, now there is so much competition prices have stayed the same.

This time however, I booked through Singapore Airline's 'Singapore Stopover' programme. As attractive as this may first appear, I'd advise against it, not only because their so-called 'special prices' are easily matched by certain websites, but also, and chiefly, because you are not able to specify what standard of room you desire, meaning you will be lumped with the basic (Tower Wing) and have to hope that there is availability in your desired level when you arrive. When I arrived, the Valley Wing was fully booked and I was upgraded to the Garden Wing, which comes with a balcony. The room was of a good standard, although the $100 difference between this and the Valley is immeaurably better value for money then the $100 per night upgrade I paid for the Garden Wing upgrade. The level of service and helpfullness of the staff is everything I have come to appreciate from a hotel widely regarded as providing a world benchmark in this area. My only real problem came on checkout. I was provided with my bill showing me what had been deducted from my deposit. I found that despite taking the upgrade fee on check-in, it had been re-applied and removed from my deposit, meaning effectively that I had paid it twice. I was not provided with a receipt for the upgrade on check-in and was refused a refund for it, met only with vague promises that they'll \"see what they can do\" and email me in due course. On top of this, I was charged for the complimentary breakfast and had to argue my rather obvious case that the charge should be removed, which it eventually was. Given that the hotel is as good as the price you pay for it, I'm forced to mark the Shang down considerably for this. Because they did not provide a receipt for my upgrade and charged me for it twice, I ended up paying the equivilent of a Valley Wing stay. My advise? Don't go through any airline 'deals' programme.

There was fresh fruit and chinese tea and a congratulations cake for us. We ate in the Line for breakfast and lunch which was lovely and an amazing selection. We had room service most days which was really tasty. We had dinner in Bleu which is fine dining. Don't be fooled by the \"barfood\" title as we were. There is a dresscode. the food was really tasty and service exceptional. We also had drinks in the bar and had a nice view of the city. (Not as nice as the view in Equinox restaurant the next night at the Swissotel.) We also had lunch in the lobby bar and was very good. All the staff everywhere are a pleasure to deal with, nothing is a problem. The location is great, just a short walk to Orchard Road and a short taxi to anywhere else you want to go.

Unfortunately, we had a bad start which did impact upon our stay. Upon arrival early evening after a long flight from Rome we were faced with a mistake with our booking. I had booked and paid for two 'Garden Wing' rooms (breakfast included) with Asia Rooms (locally RMG Tours). We were told that only one room had been reserved for us and that breakfast was not included. After about 45 minutes of questioning with no apologies and being made to feel we were at fault, we were finally given two rooms (not interconnecting and only one with a view). We were told we could change to interconnecting rooms the following evening. (This did not happen as two interconnecting rooms with garden views did not become available). The hotel said they would contact RMG tours in the morning. (This was not done and my husband had to call RMG Tours himself). My husband also requested from the hotel copies of the paper work they had received from RMG tours (This paperwork he never received). RMG Tours confirmed that we had booked and paid for two 'Garden Wing' rooms although they were unsure about whether breakfast was included. They called the hotel and late the next morning (after breakfast) all was finally confirmed. We were never able to ascertain whom was at fault. We did however receive wine and chocolates from the hotel. My advice don't use asiarooms.com and certainly don't use any website that asks for payment prior to travel. Always call the hotel a few days prior to arriving to confirm your booking. Overall the hotel was very nice - what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. Our teenage kids loved the pool. It wasn't too tricky getting a seat as can be at some hotels. I think this was because the staff removed lonesome towels regularly.

One extra tip: If you book as part of an airline deal, don't bother signing up to any city sightseeing tours - they're expensive and rushed (cabs are so cheap and much more fun).", "Date": "June 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southern California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in great location\u201d", "Author": "GlobalJana", "ReviewID": "UR7937602", "Content": "The Shangri-La is located on Orange Grove Road - just a few minutes walk to Orchard Road.

On the second day we had enough and complained that the problem was becoming intolerable. The Horizon club manager suggested that we transfer to another room and made the necessary arrangements. Well I must say that we were pleasantly surprised when we entered the room and discovered that we were upgraded to a Horizon club suite at no extra cost. We certainly were not expecting this. After the little upset with the toilet issue the rest of our stay was fantastic!!! The horizon club is excellent with complimentary cocktails and drinks each evening from 5 - 7pm, afternoon tea, free business centre and complimentary breakfast in the Blu restaurant over looking the city.

I can honestly say they live up to any amount of praise thrown their way. Hotel Transfer: Had arranged previously and the \"team\" was there to greet me as expected. They even went out of their way to try and locate my gf who was flying in from elsewhere and we had mixed up which terminals we were meeting at. Check-In/Check-Out As soon as we walked into the lobby a lady came up to greet us \"by name\" and led us directly to our room. On the way to the room she informed us that we had been upgraded to a suite. Once in the room, the butler gave us an \"induction\" to the room while the clerk took our passports/etc. and filled out the check-in forms. Within 5 minutes our luggage was there and we were checked in and alone to relax. Check-Out was just as quick. We had an early flight our last day and our luggage was picked up and loaded in the vehicle and bill paid for in a matter of 5 minutes agin. Room The room was quite impressive. I think it was the little things that really struck me. the jack so you could plug your iPod into the stereo; the pot of tea in it's own warmer; the selection of chocolates, and the automatic controls of eevrything. Service Best service I've ever come across. Nothing was too much trouble, our butler literally walked us half the way to Orchard road since we said we wanted to walk and he didn't want us lost. Probably interacted with 15 different people working for the hotel in the 36 hours we were there and all were better than I have seen elsewhere. Food Never got a chance to have breakfast (Up too late first day and gone too early the next), but did have dinner at The Line one night. I can't see anyone going hungry here......or not finding something they absolutely love to eat. Only thing here I found kind of \"over the top\" was the 1.5 liter bottle of water that cost S$16, but the food was worth it. Location It is very convenient to the one end of Orchard Road, maybe 5-10 minutes walk, but since it is not right on Orchard, you are relieved fro all the hustle and bustle. I actually couldn't think of a better spot if you want quiet/convenience. I really cant say enough good about this place.

I stayed at the Shang three years ago when my husband was on business. We were thoroughly spoilt. My husband was there for about two months I stayed for three weeks. We had a premier room in the Horizon club Tower Wing. Fantastic. Breakfast may be taken on the 24th floor. Wonderful waiter service excellent food and views to die for. Or in the main buffet restaurant on the ground floor. The best choice I have ever seen for breakfast or even lunch for that matter. Because all cuisines are available. We loved having curries and naan breads for breakfast. Or noodles dim sum and fried rices. Also Japanese which I am not a fan of . English eggs bacon sausage mushrooms omelettes etc American pancakes and waffles made fresh in front of you and anything else you can think of. Wonderful juices and fresh fruits. Pastries and muffins doughnuts and danish the list just goes on and on. We returned the following year for a four week stay. They were busy renovating the Valley Wing and the main ground floor restaurant and we just couldnt take the noise so stayed at Traders just down the road. Sister hotel to the Shang. Ok but not in the same league. But while there heard wonderful things about what was happening in the Valley Wing. Apparently once completed David and Victoria stayed there when in Singapore for the Olympic bids. So daughter and I decided to pay a visit and experience this for ourselves. If its good enough for Posh and Becks....... Valley Wing was wonderful. Bathroom was gorgeous and big enough to accomodate two women !!!!! That alone speaks volumes. Good quality toiletries replenished immediately. Abundance of towels v.v. thick and fluffy. As were the white towelling robes. Nice touch also were the lightweight cotton kimono style robes which were lovely and cool to wear after a long steamy soak in the bath watching telly. Only thing missing was a few soaps like coronation street or eastenders. Seperate dressing room area with loads of wardrobe space. We requested extra hangers and a dozen were brought immediately. Daughter hasnt quite grasped the art of packing for a week and packed instead for a month (incase we stayed on ? I wish....) But no problem there was more than enough room in robes and drawers. To be honest I was dreading twin beds. But they were very big. Just short of a normal double bed in the UK. Daughter thought it was very comfortable. I on the other hand compared it to sleeping on concrete. However I do normaly sleep on a memory foam so perhaps that was just me. Well stocked mini bar though V.V. EXPENSIVE. Two complimentary bottles of fresh water left everyday. A chocolate left everynight. Very good turndown service. With slipmat left at side of bed along with your slippers. Excellent standard of housekeeping. One small niggle was the standard of bedding. Plain white sheets and duvet covers, soft and comfortable and all changed daily but definately in need of replacement. Duvets often had threadbare patches and twice pillowcases had actual holes in them! Not in keeping with a five star hotel. Dont think Posh and Becks would have tolerated that. Breakfast in the Summit room was something else. Magnificent. Half expected the queen to join us . Everything available t the main restaurant (now called \"The Line\") is available in the Summit room but mostly served to you by the most polite and pleasant group of people. \"Nothing was too much trouble\" just doesn't do it when descibing the level of service afforded by these wonderful attentive but unobtrusive people. I am loathe to call them waiters and waitresses because they were much more than that. Greeting you by name each morning looking genuinely pleased to see you. Noting that they had missed you the previous morning when daughter had decided to try the Line for breakfast . This standard of service carried through to the champagne bar in the lobby where the same personel looked after us dishing up snacks and treats afternoon tea as good as the Ritz. Delicate hot canapes delicious especially when washed down with copious amounts of complimentary champagne. Moet and Chandon no less. All refreshments were there for the asking. Tea coffee juices coctails spirits. available from 11am thru' tll 10.30pm. And all preferences duly noted and remembered. Very weak tea for me decaf coffee for daughter. Always a glass of water served with our champagne and all prepared with out being asked usually just an acknowleding nod before we even settled in our favourite sofa. And there we would sit for a very comfortable hour or so of people watching pampering and being pandered to. All of this doesnt come cheap but hey if you are staying at the Shangri la anyway for a few pounds extra it is worth splashing out and treating your self. The price of alcholic drinks in Singapore is so expensive it wont take you long to work that it will actually save you money to upgrade to the Valley Wing. Having said that, IF the only way you can afford to stay at the Shang is in the most basic room anywhere in the hotel, then DO IT. Because it will be FAB anyway. The hotel is an experience not to be missed. With wonderful service no matter who you are. A beautiful pool where once again attendants take care of your every need. Coming around regularly with complimentary fresh fruits and ice cold towels. Waiters on hand to take your drinks and food orders. TIP... ask for a glass of iced water. This is free. Order a 1 litre bottleof water and it will cost you 22 singapore dollars, just over \u00a37. And it is not served in an ice bucket therefore will be warm before you can drink it all.

No matter where you go, generally the staff of an establishment will be polite, willing to help, pleasant, and this is simply by default. Shangri-La would not have been my first choice, in that it is expensive, not exactly centrally located, and that none of the rooms were \"my style\" except perhaps the Horizon Club rooms. You may think \"this is the #1 hotel in Singapore and they gave me AMAZING #1 level service\" but the truth is this - you can go to almost any hotel in Singapore and get similar service. The only thing you have to do is make sure the HOTEL itself is physically up to par, and the price fits your budget - and as long as that's the case, the service itself will generally follow. (Thus, if you get a budget hotel - no, you're not going to get amazing amenities.) Basically go to a 3 star hotel in Singapore and you should be generally very satisfied. However, a friend was having a wedding here so I went with the Tower Wing. I was pleased to see that the rooms were very clean, the bathrooms were lovely (as all Singaporean bathrooms tend to be), lots of free (and frequently refilled) bathroom products, and my towels were repeatedly changed even though I didn't leave them on the floor. Quaint doorbell and - I loved this - an automated room system that controls nearly everything in the room (drapes, lights for night/day/reading, warns staff that you not be disturbed, A/C, etc.). Since I am a very late sleeper it was awesome to have that big red light on outside the door so the maids didn't harass me in the morning. Phone offers 3 languages - English, Japanese ... I can't remember the 3rd! Did not love the room key power system - hotels market this as \"green\" but it also saves them energy - everything turns off until you put your card in. Singapore's a sticky humid place so A/C is paramount - and you want the A/C ON when you get back to the room. Luckily when I left the card in with all the lights off but the A/C on, staff did not remove the card (as other hotels I've been to in the US do). Bed was hard - I've been spoiled living in the US. I stayed at 2 hotels in S'pore this trip, both beds killed my back. Bathroom - huge! However, counterspace taken up by their own little containers and such. Women's disposal bag not refilled. Separate shower - great! However, totally impractal. Amazing powerful water pressure, but a glass door with practically no lip between the interior and the exterior means - flooding bathroom floor if you're not careful. Also, the majority of the floor is super lovely but superslick marble. This means walk everywhere in there carefully when your feet are wet and even better, throw a towel on the floor after showers/baths. Yes, there's a tile mosaic by the tub but you're only safe while standing still on it, not moving around the bathroom. Nowhere in the shower to put your personals other than the floor - their little caddy only holds their amenities, and barely. No place to put your personal products (shaver, loufah, etc) while in there - but on the floor! Agreed with others - tv system was pitiful for what you're paying and the modern requirements of today's travellers. Also, very limited storage space. I had two suitcases (one large, one small) and nowhere to really put them but the bench by the door, which is an eyesore. Did love the use of proper china for the tea service AND - British percolators, awesome! We only get coffee makers in the US. Pool is indeed always overrun by children - note that the hotel provides BALLOON artists and people to entertain the children! So, very family friendly pool area. The Line buffet - amazing. However, incredibly costly. So's the little \"new age\" smoothie/dessert place by the spa. I'd advise only eating the buffet for Sunday Brunch (special treat, etc.) Chinese restaurant - pretty good, not amazing. If you want every day great food for reasonable prices, don't eat at the hotel! I'd highly advise you NOT eat here because Singapore is FAMOUS for it's amazing array of multicural Asian food and you'd be wasting $ and time eating at the hotel when you can hit Orchard road (Isetan's food court!) and go to food heaven for far less. Celebrated new year's here - they sell tickets to non hotel guests (expensive) then charge $20 a drink or food item (hilarious). They hire entertainment (laughable, especially if you're into music and clubbing), have reservable tables, and if you don't reserve a table (you pay more) you get to stand! Dance floor, emcee, Xmas trees lit up in the lobby - the city always celebrates Xmas well with fabulous decor from hotels to streets. We did the hotel thing to make things easier for friends in my group who had to leave early the next morning. Would honestly not repeat it again - I think a visit to Clarke Quay would have been more fun and required no dressing up and super dry champagne. As I recall, room service ended very early. Again, about 14 channels on the television. DSL super expensive. Business center super expensive. Everything super expensive. Staff super sweet but often clueless. We asked several times about how to a) get to b) go do things (like arranging a hired car for a personal tour of Singapore - you should do it, divided by your group it's not that expensive :) - and they would often mix things up, mess things up, not know what was going on (one staff member would not tell other staff members what they said they would, etc.). For a #1, 5 star hotel, etc., they should be at the top of their game, no worries no confusion, everything perfect. Lobby is indeed busy - most Singapore hotels are. People in the city like to chill in hotel lobbies - the secret? Free A/C and maybe a drink while you hang out in comfy surroundings. Feeling sweaty - you hop into a hotel or a store, whichever suits. :) Lucky, their lobby's huge, no shortage of cabs. Tower Wing rooms looked like very modern cruise ships, and all that implies. Block glass tiles for the bathroom (so don't share the room with someone you don't mind sort of seeing you naked in the bathroom), wavy sort of theme in the cabinetry, blonde woods, modern \"stylish\" shapes. Garden Wing looked like Hawaiian 90s cheesy (pastels and such) which was why I avoided it. Oh, they are GREAT for weddings. My friend had a 700+ person banquet and the service/food/decor/arrangements/organization - EVERYTHING was amazing. I think that pretty much covers it! For the money, should and could definitely be better. It's kind of like a Rolex.

The bed is quite a distance from the little old box sitting on the dresser and is hard to see, even though I dont need or wear glasses. - Not having a free standing shower and having to step into a high edged bath is both dangerous and poor as well. I pity old people and disabled as well as I dont know how they would cope. Bathroom is huge but having to squat under a little shower spout in the bath is pretty poor. - Also took three attempts over 2.5 hours the first night to get pull-out bed made up for my child. I rang and requested this be done on leaving the room for dinner. Came back two hours later and had not been done. Rang again and said someone would come.

On the basis of reviews on TripAdvisor we booked directly into the Valley Wing - we were there for New Year and I didn't want to risk no upgrades being available. From the outisde, it looks a bit dated and the lobbies are rather 80s OTT gold, but our room was the best we've ever stayed in. Massive with modern, understated luxury. The bathroom was bigger than most bedrooms we've had in other hotels and well stocked with things to treat yourself with. We loved the VW lobby with the free drinks and snacks. We were lucky to always find a table in the smoke free zone. It's a much calmer atmosphere than you get in the main reception/hotel. Food in the Line restaurant was fabulous - we had an amazing New Year in there and also ate at lunch and breakfast without ever getting bored - so much to choose from and all beautifully presented. Edward the butler is a dream - not only providing the best service, but also the most insightful information. A couple of gripes - when we were there, a lot of people were there with children and this meant the pool became a kids' zone, even in the jacuzzi where they aren't meant to go. Also, we had to wait ages to get a table for breakfast in the VW private Summit Room. Well worth the wait when you got in there, but it's really not on for the price you're paying. One morning we couldn't wait and ate in the Line. The choice was unbelievable, but it was so busy with families and kids dashing around, that I felt jolted out of my restful state of mind induced by the VW.

Upon check-in we decided to upgrade to the Horizon club which in our case turned out to be very worthwhile. There were two things about our room which impressed and I hadn't experienced before. On either side of the superwide king size bed, in addtion to the usual night tables and table lamps, there were wall mounted reading lamps on flexible stalks which allowed one to read comfortably in bed in any position. Also, while most of the bathroom floor had slick marble tiles, there was an approximately four foot by four foot square of mosiac tiles by the bath and sink; the mosaic tiles were much more slip-resistant than the marble tiles and greatly appreciated. Also, it was nice that the bathroom amenities included toothbrush, razor, and even laundry detergent for washing clothing in the sink--necessary since Singapore is so hot and humid. The Horizon club serves a lovely breakfast buffet, and so many high quality snacks for lunch and happy hour that if you want to you can eat three meals a day there for the Horizon upgrade. The staff in the Horizon Club were very attentive and friendly. Altho the horizon club is on the top floor, the views are not great. Internet is about 25 Singapore dollars per day if you use the wired internet in your room or free in the Horizon club which is open 7-24. The location is quiet. If you plan on visiting museums or the financial district you might prefer to stay on the gentrified river, altho the Singapore river is not a large river and has no commercial traffic.

Our arrival at the hotel was a little unnerving- we were greeted with armed guards and metal detectors! This was all on account of the President of United States, George W Bush being in residence. The staff managed this upheaval in a superb manner. They were very apologetic about the unorthodox greeting but it never bothered us at all. We were given a glass of champagne whilst we waited to be escorted to our room for the check in and lady who looked after us was extremely professional and friendly. The room itself was gorgeous. It was a more traditional style than some of the other Shangri-La rooms but with beautiful contemporary twists. The amenities were as you'd expect in a hotel of that calibre with robes and slippers, free local newspaper, mineral water and so on, as well as a welcome bowl of fruit and chocolates. The bed was large and extremely comfortable, as was the rest of the furniture in the room of which there was plenty. The bathroom was very spacious and immaculate, with the tub having the added luxury of a small TV inbuilt in to the wall above it. The seperate shower was amazing- truly the biggest shower head I have ever seen! I also liked the fact that there was plants in the room as seeing greenery in hotels is a rarity and much missed for me. There was also free internet access on two computers in the business centre which was very handy. The food we had at the hotel was all excellent. We had the option of dining in the Summit Room within the Valley Wing or The Line restaurant in the main part of the hotel for breakfast which was included in the room rate and after having our first breakfast in Summit Room, we were very happy to go there every morning. As well as there being numerous choices on the continental buffet, there was also a menu on the table where we were able to choose an a la carte item which the chef made freshly there and then. We had corned beef hash a couple of times and french toast once, which were all fabulous. The service in the Summit Room was amazing too- incredibly attentive without being obtrusive which seemed to be the hallmark of Shangri-La Singapore staff. We had afternoon tea a couple of times in the lobby which was lovely. The sandwiches and cakes on the stand that came with our drinks always seemed to be just enough, and the ambience in the lobby, particularly with the resident harpist playing, was very calming and genteel. We also ate at Shang Palace which we found was delightful (a couple on the next table to us had never actually eaten Chinese food before and the manager of the restaurant could not have been more helpful in helping them choose which kind of things they might enjoy- he even brought them a knife and fork so they didn't have to use chopsticks!) and decent value for money. We also had dinner once at The Line which was outstanding. The array of food to choose from was absolutely mind boggling! There were a dozen or more different food stations to choose from, and it was a case of eating as much as you liked. There was a station for seafood, pizza, pasta, Chinese, Indian, dim sum, carved meats, salad, fruit, desserts, ice cream and numerous others. What set this place apart from so many others in my opinion was the quality of the food. At so many buffets (although it feels like a bit of an injustice to call it a buffet), food can be mass produced so is sat out for a long time, and of a low quality. Not so this restaurant, where it was cooked and prepared freshly and at regular intervals. For people with a smaller appetite, they do have an a la carte menu too but that really would be missing out. The location of the hotel we found to be very good for our needs. It was only a 10 minute walk at the most to the hustle and bustle of Orchard Road and a further 5 minutes to the nearest MTR station of Orchard. We didn't find the walk taxing although the heat and humidity didn't help too much!! We were contacted on our last night by front desk staff about our planned check out time. We assumed that it would be noon, so that's what we said. We were then asked what time our car was coming to take us to the airport. As we had a late night flight, it was 7.30pm. We were then offered the room until 6pm with no extra charge, which was an absolute godsend. It meant that we had almost another whole day to spend in Singapore, and then we could come back and get showered and changed before leaving. We were so grateful for this as being able to have a shower and a change of clothes in advance of a 14 hour flight home was priceless. For the remaining time after we checked out, our cases were left at the bell desk (obviously at no charge) so we could have some dinner before we left. This kind of service is why this hotel is so revered and praised. The small touches in the Valley Wing are what truly sets it apart from other hotels with 'club floors'. The fact that within hours, the staff were addressing us by name. The helpfulness of the staff with even the most minute query. That even the carpet in the lifts are changed every day so it says whichever day of the week it is. The smiling 'Welcome Home' from the doormen as you arrive back at the hotel. All of it just made the place a joy to be in and we probably spent the most time in this hotel than any other before, just because it was such a lovely place to be. If we return to Singapore in the future, there won't be a moment's hesitation in choosing Shangri-La Singapore again.", "Date": "December 1, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service\u201d", "Author": "mup", "ReviewID": "UR6310104", "Content": "Arrived at Reception to be told our requested room in the Garden Wing was not available due to a \"Media Conference\".

Entering the vast lobby, the mature tropical trees and pool around which the hotel is built on three sides are already on view through ceiling-height windows. Unless you are economising on an overnight stay, forgo the rather bland Tower rooms and take a spacious Garden Wing Pool-View room with balcony to make the most of the palm tree and rainforest surroundings and to have more direct access to the outdoor areas. Our room was meticulously equipped and maintained. The large lagoon pool, popular in the Singapore heat, includes a good area for children, and there are tennis courts and a gym. A memorable aspect was the seriously good cooking in the three hotel restaurants we tried. The two-course Peking Duck in the Shang Palace Chinese restaurant was as good as we have had anywhere. The small lunch buffet in the Rose Veranda, easily missed in its mezzanine location overlooking the garden, had a great range of taste treats being constantly refreshed. But the showstopper is the \u201cThe Line\u201d restaurant, an ultra-modern design tour de force on the pool level that is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

(For example, they add gratuity for the room service if I remember rightly). However, I suppose that if you're in a place like this, you might expect these things?

The lobby was typical of many Shangri-La hotels \u2013 huge and marble with lots of comfortable sofas. The staff were beautifully dressed and willing to help in the efficient way in which is typical in Singapore. Our check-in was swift, and we were offered an upgrade \u2013 at a cost \u2013 which we turned down. Our room was large and nicely decorated, and both it and the bathroom had all that we required, including an ironing board. The breakfast buffet was brilliant \u2013 selections of food from all around the world. We also enjoyed a drink in both the Lobby Bar and in Blu on the top floor. Note that the drinks are VERY expensive \u2013 a beer and a glass of white wine was in excess of US$20. The view from the top floor, and indeed from the room, was not spectacular, and only offered a very limited view of the city skyline in the distance. My only real gripe is about the location. It is at the top end of Orchard Road, and it is a fifteen minute walk to the MTR station. From here it is another twenty or more minutes to the \u2018downtown area\u2019 and Chinatown. Including for buying tickets and waiting on a train, it could take you nearly an hour to make it from your room to, say, the nearest MTR to the Merlion and Raffles Plaza. For that reason, if time was very precious and you only had a couple of days in the city, then I would suggest booking another hotel. When in Singapore I recommend having a drink and throwing peanut shells on the floor in the Long Bar of Raffles Hotel, spending an evening at the Night Safari, and hitting Chinatown for some satay washed down with an ice cold Tiger beer. If you have a few days to spare and you want some rest and relaxation, then I would suggest heading for the Indonesian island of Bintan, only forty-five minutes from Singapore by catamaran \u2013 it really is a tropical paradise. The Angsana Resort & Spa comes highly recommended.

We stayed at Raffles the Plaza, The Ritz-Carlton, The Four Seasons and the Shangri-La. Our final stop was the Shangri-La hotel where we stayed in the Garden Wing. I'm sorry, but the Garden Wing was downright shabby! ROOM We reserved the Deluxe Room in the Garden Wing which is one step above the Tower Wing and one step below in the Valley Wing. We were disappointed from when we first stepped into the room. While the room was big and had a good view of the pool and gardens, it was just too shabby, rundown and so 1980s in terms of its furnishings. There was a medium sized regular TV, an \"executive\" writing desk made of plastic, Internet connections, a sitting area with a huge window and balcony, and controls by the bed to open the curtains. BATHROOM The bathroom was disgusting! The toilet and bidet were not in a separate alcove, but there was a separate shower cubicle and a regular bathtub. The hotel only provided no-name Shangri-La amenities and to top it off, there were huge yellow stains on the sink and around the bidet. HOTEL FACILITIES/RESTAURANTS The hotel offered a fitness centre/Spa and a pool, but we didn't use these facilities. There were numerous restaurants to choose from, but we only dined at The Line restaurant for a late dinner. Their range of food was limited and the staff seemed more interested in the soccer game on TV than serving us. The food however, was acceptable. The lobby area, the pool and the Valley Wing however are truly beautiful and luxurious. SERVICE The staff were all very friendly, curteous and full of smiles. The only big complaint I have (and this is a complaint amongst many luxury hotels these days) is their tendency to use internationally unrecognised geographic names (i.e. \"Arabian\" Gulf as opposed to the correct \"Persian Gulf\") in their brochures can be insulting/politically insensitive to certain guests, especially someone of Persian descent. SURROUNDINGS The hotel is 10 minutes away from Orchard Road on foot. I recommend exploring the area on foot in the evening as it's less crowded than during the day.

Checking-In is incredibly fast and takes place in the privacy of your room. Free sandwiches and drinks in the lobby in the afternoon are a nice extra and breakfast is included... definitely worth evey cent! The only thing this hotel misses in comparison to the Ritz, Oriental or Swissotel Stamford is the view which is definitely not very spectacular... The other parts of the hotel are a bit less impressive and very much in the style of the 70's... seems a little dated! Food at the poolside restaurant was a bit bland and the service was not very attentive... The gym is large and well equipped but you better take your jacket with you as the room is definitely undercooled. If you're looking for a quiet retreat in the city center to relax after a tiring day in the tropical heat, Shangri-La's Valley Wing is the right choice.

Picked the Ritz Carlton and Shangri-la. This hotel is about four blocks off of the famous Orchard Road. I chose it because of it's reputation and it's convenience to this shopping area. Many designer shops here. Better than Rodeo Dr. in Beverly Hills. A par with all the world's large cities. I took a cab from the Ritz. Arriving here, my luggage was taken and I was directed to the reception as I expected. Beautiful, classic interior lobby. My room was in the main tower and I had a partial view of one of the pools. There are three towers to this large complex. I believe I was in the oldest one. This room was large, quiet, clean and well equipped as expected. From looking at photos of the bath, I think the newer wing has a bit larger bath with two sinks instead of one. See my photos. I was happy with the separate shower. As I had read on this site, the hotel operated a free shuttle van to the center of Orchard Road all day and into the evening. I used this a few times. I found the most convenient subway stop was a block away from where the hotel guests were dropped off by the van. I took the train to the city center. Central Singapore is hard to get around for an outsider because the streets are not in a grid patern. Used my compass to help orientate me. Much shopping is underground to avoid the heat, which isn't bad in March. There is a Chinese restaurant in the lobby of the hotel, one of several restaurants. Had a very nice dinner here although it was expensive. The staff was great. Had several extended conversations with them. With their suggestion I made a quick cab trip to the National Botanical Gardens near this hotel. I caught a cab rather quickly back from the gardens because the cabbie told me that he likes to use the convenient restrooms by the parking lot of the Botanical gardens. Large pools and landscaped grounds. Better than the Ritz. The bay view at the Ritz-Carlton beats anything at The Shangri-la. Bath is nicer at the Ritz too.

Everything one would expect from a Five Star Hotel and more; much more. My wife and I stayed at this Hotel for three days in late September, on our return journey from Australia. We stayed in a Valley Wing Room; the facilities included complimentary breakfast with snacks and canapes throughout the day, as well as (unlimited) free drinks including champagne and spirits, from 11 am to 10.30 pm. On this same trip we also stayed at the Shangri-la Hotels in Bangkok, Sydney and Cairns and we found the Singapore Shangri-la a splendid Hotel; all the staff were very helpful, friendly and pleasant. A word of caution: if you stay at this Hotel on your outward journey, any other Five Star Hotel you may stay at subsequently may come as a bit of a disappointment !", "Date": "September 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cTakes your breath away\u201d", "Author": "JOHNandAMY", "ReviewID": "UR3843624", "Content": "We stayed at the Shangri-La for 3 nights as the first part of our honeymoon. As soon as you walk into the hotel it takes your breath away. It is truely amazing. The staff are amazingly friendly, and made us feel very special on our honeymoon, with an upgrade, honeymoon cake and fresh green tea, and roses on the bed. I cannot praise this hotel enough and highly recommend a late night 'Revolt' Champagne cocktail in the hotel's Blu bar overlooking the City. Amazing. If we go back to Singapore I would not consider staying anywhere else, as the hotel has the added advantage of being only a 5 min walk to Orchard Road.", "Date": "September 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "nottingham england", "Title": "\u201cfantastic\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3810419", "Content": "wow what a fantastic hotel, if you want to be treated like royalty then this is the hotel for you, on arrival at the hotel the reception staff were there to welcome you and showed you to reception and then on to your room, after a few moments in the room we were brought a basket of fresh fruit and a basket which contained a pot of herbal tea which was very nice and refreshing. the rooms we had were the deluxe tower room and it was imaculate the view from the room was of the pool and was breath taking. the food thow expensive in the hotel was excellent with every sort of dishes you could imagine. service was very quick and nothing was to much trouble for any member of staff, finally you must try the cocktails in the lounge they were out of this world ( well we were most of the time ). very highly recomended we will be returning again in 2006 but for much longer as there is plenty to see and do", "Date": "August 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "brit living in Spain", "Title": "\u201cThe best hotel ive stayed at\u201d", "Author": "freckles", "ReviewID": "UR3802561", "Content": "Well what can I say, we arrived at the hotel ( the Valley Wing) at 9pm, was greeted with an orchid, as soon as we told the staff our name, they realised we were on honeymoon and I was given a beautiful bouquet of flowers, we were shown to our room to be checked in and were told about resturant times, etc.. on the way. We had been upgraded to a suite, (paid for by the travel operater as they made a huge mistake on our previous hotel in Koh Samui) the room was fantastic, huge living room, with enough chocolates for a week, and a cake with ''happy honeymooners'' on it, bedroom huge, bed looked lovely with the flowers on it, bathroom great, husband loved the TV in there, double sinks. The suite was clean, with lots of flowers and plants, and nice little touches, eg.. stationary with my husbands name on it, choice of 6 different sorts of pillows, different air-con temps in different rooms, TV in every room, fax in room, The butler was lovely, he spent a long time getting the lap top we requested working as there was a problem with the connection, but he got it working, (laplops are free if in a suite you just pay the connection fee) Laundry service was excellent, I had just had a tattoo done on my lower back and had got ink on the waist of one of my skirts, but it came back like brand new, and the same day, Food was excellent, ate in the buffet (the line?) the first night , fantastic HUGE choice, also ate in ''Blu'' again excellent, the breakfast were superb, which were complimentry in the Valley Wing, as were the drinks and nibbles provided thoughout the day. does nothing for your waistline staying there!!!! The staff were very on the ball, very attentive, smart, pleasant, polite but without any snobbery, loved the guy on the door. we have stayed in some fantastic hotels in the past all round the world, and this one will will visit again, we were only 3 nights, and wish it was longer, Singapore also fantastic Jenny", "Date": "August 24, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "MarieC89", "ReviewID": "UR3761080", "Content": "I stayed at the Shangri-la for 3 nights with my family as a stop over before moving on to Australia.

We upgraded our room to a superior room in the tower wing and, the view over the city was amazing, probably because we were on the 22nd floor!

We specifically chose it over many other wonderful hotels for its luscious grounds and gardens, something at quite a premium in Singapore! I had booked a room in the Garden wing through their website and breakfast, laundry, airport transfers and free wireless internet access were all included in the price. We were met at the airport and whizzed away in a state of the art new Mercedes and instantly made to feel like royalty! Upon arrival we were taken to a special reception where they did super fast check in and were given a complimentary upgrade to a suite! Not bad we thought Well this was our first experience with Asian hospitality and hotel service and we were totally blown away with their friendliness, efficiency, professionalism and kindness. The room and bathroom was fantastic and the view over the gorgeous garden and pool was stunning. The breakfast buffet was the biggest and most incredible spread we had ever seen and quite delicious too! They offer a whole series of courses such as a cookery class, ice sculpting class, yoga etc... The pool was so refreshing as it is a very hot and humid place and was very welcome after a long day of sightseeing. We thouroughly recomend doing the night safari, a visit to Sentosa Island with the cable car, a visit to the aquarioum and afternoon tea at Raffles is a must! And you will have never seen a metro station this clean!!!! All in all, our first encounter with Singapore was super and we were overwhelmed with the Shangri-la & would definitely go back over and over again!", "Date": "August 11, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Shangri-La Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d302109-Reviews-Shangri_La_Hotel-Singapore.html", "Price": "$312 - $597*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">22 Orange Grove Rd.</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">258350</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "302109", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ee/53/ee53e2658887690ad2f8794b37ca2f493large.jpg"}}
