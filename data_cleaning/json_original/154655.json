The location was good, near the Revolution Monument and walking distance to other sites of the city, plus shops, restaurants etc and not far at all from Chapultepec Park. However, it did get quite noisy at night. We saw on the hotel website that they have a connection with Six Flags to get discounted tickets. This wasn't the case. The man on reception sent us to one of their partner hotels and said they were waiting for us and could get us tickets, however when we arrived they didn't know what we were talking about, so was wasted money in a taxi. Overall, I would say our stay was ok, but will probably try somewhere else if we return to Mexico City.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island City, New York", "Title": "\u201cInternet does not work, noisy, problems with key\u201d", "Author": "Northernette", "ReviewID": "UR116484441", "Content": "I reserved through a website online and prices at the front desk were significantly lower.

The second night I had problems with my key and had to go three times to the front desk to get the problem solved. Their solution was that everytime I was to use the room I needed a bell boy to open with the master key. The price is good but so is the price of other hotels in the area with better services.

Tiny room. Luggage had to be stored in closet. No light in closet required luggage removal for retrieval of any item.With no air conditioning had to keep windows open. No screens... after 2nd night counted 17 mosquito bites on head, neck, arms. Very noisy...could hear everything that went on in nearby rooms. Shower had a hole in partition and flooded bathroom floor. Shower floor not sanitary, bathroom window very dirty. Elevator leveller system doesn't work properly missing its position by 2 to 8 inches leading to stubbed toes or stumbles. Wireless internet cost 50 pesos/24 hours and then of very short range (didn't work at bar next door) and not 100% reliable. All staff very rude and unhelpful with the exception of the 2 English speaking doormen. Was made fun of by desk staff. Food and beverage staff in overpriced restaurant unwilling to assist even when I was the only customer. No complementary ice to cool beverages in room. (ca be obtained at the liquor store across the street cheaply). Take the $5 you save on Wi-Fi and spend it on an upgrade to a nicer property that includes internet access. Only redeeming factors: pool (closes too early at 8:00 PM), decent location, price.

It was easy to book online or via the phone. Rates are very reasonable, the rooms small but comfortable, and the location excellent in terms of nearness to just about everything (Monument to the Revolution, Zocalo, Alameda Park, Insurgentes/Reforma, Zona Rosa, & Chapultepec -- all walkable as is the Revolucion Metro Station. The nearby streets are relatively quiet at night. While there are a couple of relatively good restaurants fairly close (along with a Starbucks), most of the rest are just so-so (including two Sanborns or avoidable (VIPs). Their own restaurant is just fair but with good service. I like the breakfasts. My only complaints are that sometimes the interior light well can be noisy from visiting school groups (who also crowd the elevators). I also find it a bit annoying to have to buy internet access (available throughout the hotel) every 24 hours for a relatively small fee. Their fees for doing any laundry work are just outrageous - so skip that.
