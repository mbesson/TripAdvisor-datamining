This is a small hotel, ten rooms, located in a very narrow calle. The location is wonderful - one minute walk to Ponte Rialto, ten minute walk to Piazza San Marco, and right in the middle of the city so you can wander Venezia until your feet hurt - yet the short walk down the narrow calle transforms the sights and sounds from busy and touristy to quiet and tranquil very quickly. The rooms are on the small side, decorated simply with Venetian style (i.e., Murano glass, etc.) and are very clean. What sets this value hotel apart from others is the location and the wonderful sisters who run it. Within 30 seconds of arriving we felt like we were returning home rather than visiting a hotel. I can't describe how helpful, friendly, informative and genuinely charming both Ambra and Stefania are. When they listen attentively to you, whether it be a request for a restaurant, directions, or just talking about venetians, it's a real pleasure to listen. They recommended our favorite restaurant in Venice which is not top ten TA, called \"Al No No\". The location and price of San Salvador are great, but Ambra and Stefania are what make San Salvador really special.

My room was clean and comfortable. There was some noise at night from an adjacent restaurant but it didn't bother my sleep. I was on the go constantly. Being by the Rialto Bridge was a great location for exploring the city and easily finding my way back on foot or by vaporetto. Sometimes you just want to change shoes, drop off packages, or relax a few minutes before going out at night. The location made that possible. I purchased a 48 hour vaporetto pass so it made the trips convenient and affordable. I'd definitely stay there again without hesitation. When I left to travel Florence, it was only a 10 minute vaporetto ride to the train station. When I arrived in Venice, I took a water taxi from the airport directly to the Rialto stop. It was an easy walk to the square but a bit of a challenge to find the hotel. It's down a pedestrian passage way (past some public phones on the wall) just before the Disney store. There's a hotel sign at foot level pointing the way. There isn't a sign coming out of the wall at or above eye level.

Also, it is a minute away from the Rialto Bridge, which is really convenient when going to the other districts of Venice on the opposite side of the Grand Canal. Only thing that I found kind of weird was the handkerchief type towels. They did the job of drying us out, but I prefer regular towels.", "Date": "September 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newport, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, extremely friendly staff\u201d", "Author": "ratkovic70", "ReviewID": "UR70373893", "Content": "My wife and I spent 1 night at this hotel in June, 2010.

We stayed in early Jun for three nights. The staff was extremely friendly and is family run, gave us a great restaurant recommendation and accommodated us with our early 5 a.m. check out to catch an early train. The rooms were immaculately kept. The bathrooms, and shower were small (wouldn't recommend for overweight or very tall people), but that's Venice. We had no issues with cleanliness and our sheets were changed daily the minute we left the room.

Upon questioning, the night staffer claimed that the bites came from mosquitoes and that he had never heard of bed bugs. The daytime staffer had heard of bedbugs and knew whom to call, but claimed she had never heard of them at this hotel. Unlikely, given the insect fecal stains on the walls below the mattress. They essentially accused me of bringing the bugs in and refused to refund any money.
