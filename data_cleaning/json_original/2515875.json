In walking distance to Epcot, you enter thru the back near the UK Pavilion which was great because I love Fish and Chips! It's a short boat ride to Disney Studios. You can also walk it if you like approx 20 minutes! The rooms were great and very clean! I only had a Standard room in the back but that was ok because it was nice an quiet there. The bus to Magic Kingdom is about 15 minutes and Animal Kingdom is about 20 minutes. I didn't pay for Club Service but felt I didn't need it.

Should we be near the Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, Epcot...? In the end we went on style and we were not disappointed. New England style with no real signs of Micky in the room. Perfect. Breakfasts were repetitive but OK. The kids enjoyed the pool but best of all the Beaches and Cream burger bar. Downsides for me was that it was impersonal. We would breakfast at the hotel every day and we would get the same old explanation about how the buffet was laid out. Unfortunately this hotel had the character dining each morning with the same characters every day so the novelty wore off for the children after a few days. Also as it is character breakfast there are massive queues. You have to book a table for breakfast in your own hotel via the concierge and he would often say it was fully booked. My suggestion is to get down to breakfast early to walk in. Another minor point but annoying was taht the A/c was on way too high in the public areas so take a cardi! However, if you just don\u00b4t know which hotel to choose and you don\u00b4t want to be \"Mickeyed-out\", I would say Disney\u00b4s Beach Club or Yacht Club.

We have never known anyone to stay at the Beach Club. WOW!! What a great resort!! We chose to stay here mainly for the pool. We had to check out the \"sand bottom\" pool. Amazing! I don't know how they do it, but it's absolutely amazing. Multiple hot tubs, large swimming areas, a huge water slide, and a lazy river make this the ultimate pool complex. The lobby was bright and welcoming and the resort layout wasn't as confusing as most resorts. Our room was nice. Understand that we were on the Club Level. Not because we're rich, but because that was all that was available when we booked. Two queen beds and a sofabed we're perfect for our family of 5 with children between ages 7 and 10. The Club Level was great. On the 5th and top floor, only accessible by entering your room key into the slot in the elevator, it had a cozy little lounge that was always stocked with some type of food, snacks, and/or drinks. The breakfast bar was the perfect way to start our day every morning. 2 concierges at your service between 6am and 10pm ready and willing to answer your every need and always greeting you with a smile. The location of the resort was perfect. Literally a 5 minute stroll to the International Gateway at Epcot, it's also within a stone's throw of the Boardwalk Resort and the Dolphin and Swan Resorts. Hop in a boat, and it's a short ride to Hollywood Studios. The bus service was the same as you would see at any of the resort hotels. You have to wait a while on a bus to arrive and then there's the slow, but steady ride to your destination. I will say that there were very few stops in-between (if any), which made for quicker bust trips.

Super pool complex - the best in the park! Very quiet room HVAC system. Negatives: Room in need of rehab and a good cleanaing! We could write our name in the dust on the desk.

Theme was awesome. We liked the proximity to Epcot also. Stormalong Bay we were told via mail would be closed during our stay for refurbishments but it was operating and was fun. Your room location can defiantely make or break your stay here. Also be sure to request a LARGE BALCONY. I made the mistake on the online check-in to check off large or small not knowing the difference. A small balcony means you will have a door and a 3 inch square to stand on. Other than aesthetics I'm not sure what the hell the purpose of those balconies is for. So useless. Also for the price we would have liked a larger fridge and a microwave in the room. Also in hindsight travelling with 2 young kids we should have gotten a suite with a seperate room. Otherwise you'll all be in one large room and well my kids won't sleep if the light or tv is on. We stayed on the third floor closer to the small pool and Epcot. It was a good location for Epcot, laundry and small pool but a decent walk to the lobby and a big hike to the buses. Also the transportation stinks here. Buses to AK and DD include 4 other hotels so they are always packed. It took us 1 hour to get home from DD and 45 minutes from AK. The food court is also not that great. Very minimal offerings and selection. The French Quater has a better food court and is a Disney moderate hotel. Overall I would stay here again for the pools, proximity to EPCOT, and the overall theme and the rooms were comfortable. I would just be very particular in room request and if travelling during a busier time I might think about driving to some park and attractions rather than relying on Disney buses. We also liked wlaking to Hollywood Studios and the boat there. Beaches and Cream was great too as was room service.

Club level room review\u201d", "Author": "KatieCollette", "ReviewID": "UR128657650", "Content": "This is my absolute favorite Disney resort stay that we have had so far! It started when we pulled up in our car at 10:00 AM (wayyyy before the 4:00 PM check in). I gave my name to the bellhop who was unloading our car and another man walked up to us and told us our room was already ready. They led us up to our room floor (it was club level) and had a personalized check in there. My only complaint is that I felt kind of rushed, they just gave us our papers and the bellhop took us straight to the room. While I know that having a fast checkin is good, I just felt like they wanted to be done with us and check us off their list, instead of giving us the personal check in that is expected for club level. Next, the bell hop took us all the way down two hallways to the very last room on the floor. We didn't mind the walk since you come to Disney World expecting to walk a lot, but I know others wouldn't feel the same way. We received one of only three king bed rooms in the room category we booked for, and they have to fit the kings into odd shaped rooms to make it fit, which is why we had a corner room all the way at the end of the resort. And, we didn't mind at all, because the room was HUGE! It was a big square shape that you could have easily fit another king bed in there and still had plenty of room. We also had two standing balcony's since we were a corner room. The bed was huge and comfy, which we also received a nice turn down service complete with chocolates every night. The bathroom was big and clean. Housekeeping was immaculate. This was our first time doing club level and we would do it again! The cast members went out of their way to make our stay magical, getting us whatever we wanted. One of the men even overhead us talking about needing a phone charger and not having one, and he walked over and handed us one to borrow! The food was plentiful, enough to eat a solid breakfast every morning. They had pastries, breads, hard boiled eggs, oatmeal, and fruit. Snacks during the day included chips, pretzels, candy, trail mix. They had appetizers and veggies at night, along with desserts. They helped us make and cancel a few dinner reservations and basically made our trip great! The pool was awesome, could always find some chairs in the shade. Sometimes the main hot tub was crowded, but there were a few more that were more hidden that you could relax in. Sand bottom was great! One tiny complaint we had was that the main lobby is always crowded with people waiting to go into the restaurant that is there. Other than that, great hotel and we wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!

You just walk around and take in the breathtaking view of the waters, the lighthouse. and the boardwalk across the lake. And when you walk into the Lobby you are hit with the most wonderful smell. We finally asked and was told it was Green Aloe and Clover. I wanted to bottle it and bring it home! Another thing I want to mention is that everyday you leave to go to the parks or whatever you room is of course serviced by housekeeping. We had a wonderful housekeeper and everyday we would come back to a new surprise in our room. She used towels to leave animal shapes in our room. One day it was a monkey hanging from our lamp, then it was a huge lobster, then a rabbit, then two swans touching noses. A couple of days we had someone different. On those days our server would use my son's toys as our surprise. I had bought him a T-Rex from Animal Kingdom. We came back to find it guarding the door.

The rooms are clean, quiet (at least our section is quiet), and family friendly. There is easily enough room for a family of five. They have started doing some remodeling... starting with the fantastic pool area. Any time there is updating going on it is a nuiscence, but that is to be expected. It is a short walk to Epcot and if your room patio faces Epcot you can see some or most of the evening fire works display. The boat ride to Hollywood is about 5 -8 minutes and it runs every 15-20 minutes from the boat dock. The ride to Magic Kingdom is about 12-15 minutes. BCR is the first stop, so you are pretty much guaranteed a seat or a standing spot. At least that is our experience. The bus to Animal kingdom took a bit longer if I recall correctly. We were there seven days.. it turns into a blur after awhile. The steak house on property at the YCR is fanastic, the sit down buffet in the BCR was great with more choices that you can imagine. They have a character breakfast with Mickey, Minnie, Daisy, and Goofy. Donald may have been there, but I don't recall. The Market Street cafe/convenience shop at BCR had plenty of food options, and they carried plenty of supplies of little things we forgot. They also carry a lot of Disney gear. When you make your reservations for Disney book it out 180 days in advance and book all other options at that time. It gets very time intensive and confusing when you book thigs randomly. Know what dining plan you want (we laways do Delux and pretty much use everything up especially when it is hot and you buy a lot of waters and iced drinks. Know where you want to eat your sit downs especially the character dining as they fill up fast. Aim to have one early breakfast at MK so you can enter the park early and score some great photo ops without the crowds! If you are flying to Orlando use the Magical Express to get to and from airport and hotel. Just provide them with your flight info and they take care of the rest. Easy!! I have celiacs disease so eating out is difficult at best. But WDW made it SO easy. At sit downs the chef came out to help with menu options and changes that he could make, at quick service places the manager would come out and go over my choices make the necessary changes and then they would make the meal themselves and deliver to me and only me. They do this for all allergy issues. It was such a treat to have seven days of no meal worries!!

I think we picked a near perfect location as this resort is located within walking distance of Epcot (literally, a 4 minute walk around the sidewalk) and is a short 8 minute ferry ride to Hollywood Studios. Of course, bus transportation picks you up at the front door and takes you to MK and AK, also in a matter of minutes. So, for location, you simply can't beat it. Service: Unmatched. Every employee that we encountered was eager to assist in any way possible to make our stay better. You will not find better service. Resort: As with everything Disney, beautiful everything. It really is an eye-catching place and the beach, landscaping, lobby, rooms, market, etc. were all spotless. Located right on the lake and a 5 minute ferry ride to the Boardwalk. The swimming pool is a work of art, complete with hot tubs and water slides. Just being here makes you feel good. Dining: Several options, all are super busy so reservations are strongly recommended! We ate at the Captain's Grille. Food was OK, service was marginal and none of us felt like we got the appropriate bang-for-the-buck. My daughter ordered the snow crab legs for $29. She's had better at Red Lobster. My fish filet was about the size of the filet-o-fish at McD's, but costs 12x more. We didn't try the other 'nice' restaurant or the seafood buffet. We did go to \"Beaches-n-Cream\", a retro styled soda shop/ice cream bar. You can get sandwiches here too. Our brownie sundae was spectacular and it was enough for several to share. Rooms: The rooms are very nicely appointed, very Cape Cod'ish in decor, tastefully and appropriately \"disneyed\" here and there. Clean linens, clean room, nice view of the courtyard. No complaints at all. Overall, you pay for the location and the service. The room really isn't that much nicer than other 'moderate' hotels (Hampton Inn, H.I.

Lots of people book the Beach Club versus the Yacht Club, because of the two, it's closest to the Epcot entrance (a real advantage when you're lugging your family out of the park after a long day). But if you ask for a room with a number from 2500 to 2599, you'll get the added bonus of being even closer. We were in the 2550 - 2560 range which was prime real estate.

We booked 3 rooms, one for my husband and I for 8 nights, and one each for my parents and my son for 5 nights each. My father is in a wheelchair so we needed a handicap accessible room for him along with a few medical needs to make his stay more comfortable. I had done the online checkin (which I highly recommend) and our rooms were ready when we arrived. However, even though I had confirmed several times with reservations about the special needs for my father, the first room they assigned him was not handicapped accessible and they were not aware of the extra medical necessities. The front desk staff was very apologetic and got them reassigned right away and the medical items were delivered within minutes of they arriving in the room. We had a problem with our first room also but it was remedied by a very helpful cast member who went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was magical. Once the check in process was complete...the rest of our stay was wonderful.

It's very convenient to stop and get refills in your refillable mugs on the way to the room. It is a large resort and some of the rooms are quite a hike from the elevator. If you need to be close you should try to request a room nearer the elevator. There are differences with the balconies also. My son and parents had small balconies with their rooms. Only one person could stand on the balcony. My husband and I had a full balcony with two chairs and a table. The decor was very well themed. The beds were very comfortable and the room was spacious for a Disney room (all disney rooms are a bit smaller than your normal hotel rooms at the various rate levels).

This made it very difficult for us because the kids were torn from wanting to enjoy the pool or spending time with their grandparents who they see 3 times a year. It was very disappointing considering my in-laws are season pass holders and have visited Disney (staying on property) more than 65 more times, and make frequent trips per year. The staff would make absolutely no exception, and at one point they would not let my husband in the pool area, because he did not have the room key, even I walked over and told the cast member this way my husband (who's the room was registered too and paid for it). The resort is very nice though; rooms are OK, not as nice as the Contemporary. But the location is great, unless you have very little kids and plan on spending the majority of time at Magic Kingdom (you have to bus over). My kid are 12 and 8, and have gone to Disney every year, so we usually only spend 1 to 2 days at magic kingdom, and schedule dinners at other parks/resorts.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, PA", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience at Disney's Beach Club\u201d", "Author": "JudygReading_PA", "ReviewID": "UR124716491", "Content": "My husband and I (both newly retired) decided to take a 'soul breather' and go to Disney for a long weekend to experience good old Disney joy and delight!

This hotel absolutely CAN'T be beat for the location. My 2 favorite parks, Epcot & Hollywood Studios, are within walking distance! HS is a bit of a hike, but it's a nice refreshing walk along the water, and since Disney is about indulgence, the extra exercise is nice. Being able to catch the boats is nice as well - it's just very beautiful. Epcot's \"International Gateway\" by the countries is just around the corner! I booked Club Level, and was not too impressed with their offerings, or the \"Stone Harbor Club\" room which is in need of some updates. A few cookies, a jar of gummy fish, a jar of white chocolate covered pretzels and a jar of trail mix does not club level make - HOWEVER, I had the deluxe dining plan so it didn't really matter. If I was counting on a \"meal\" here I'd be disappointed (but please note I never saw breakfast, and the Mickey sprinkle cookies were the best cookies everrrrr) The chips & red pepper ranch dip were also good. Basically, it's a place to \"nibble\" in between meals. it just seems so small, and dark, that it's not a place eyou want to \"hang out\" really. The room was clean, and served our purpose, and I don't really have major complaints, but it didn't \"wow\" me either. It just needs to be \"refreshed\" - since there furnishings are white they are showing age. My biggest complaint, really, was the in- room safe - which was definitely an afterthought - it was built into the wall and so shallow, it would not fit much at all, and certainly not a laptop (glad I didn't bring it) - the fact that we had to use a hard key was also annoying. I prefer the \"real\" safes with electronic locks. This, however, is a very minor complaint (do I sound spoiled?) and not enough to make me dislike the hotel. The big standout here was the SERVICE. With the exception of our arrival experience (they did not have our folder ready when we arrived after 3 pm, and the girl who greeted us said we \"surprised her\" - huh? With an advance reservation?) the concierge staff were AWESOME at club level - especially Vilma. Dave at the concierge in the lobby was great and had a nice sense of humor, and the bell staff is amazing. This was my one big improvement over the Grand Floridian, where the cast just doesn't seem as \"happy\" at the beach club.

There are also 2 other pools at the beach club (that I know of) that are for those who enjoy a bit more peace and quiet. The Location.... The location is perfect. It is walking distance to EPCOT, literally a 5 minute walk, and about a 20 minute walk to Disney Hollywood Studios (or you can just take the water taxi that will get you there in 10 minutes or so). Last Summer I was lucky enough to have a room where I could see the fireworks at EPCOT ,and even one of the other parks, all from my balcony. My balcony also had a view of the pool, beach, and boardwalk. If you can't see the EPCOT fireworks from your room and you dont want to deal with the massive crowds at the park, then you can just go by the lighthouse and see the fireworks there. There are lots of great places to eat. You can stay at the hotel and go to the buffet at Cape May, or you can go to Beaches and Cream for some fries and shakes by the pool. The Steak place (cant remember the name) is also an option at the Yacht Club. Just a 5 minute walk away you can go to the restaurants at the Swan and Dolphin, or the many restaurants at the Boardwalk area. Also by the boardwalk are tons of games (like what you would expect at a Boardwalk somewhere in the Mid Atlantic States). And also just a short walk are many EPCOT restaurants which means a lot because there are tons of great restaurants to chose from (France, Italy, Japan, and others too!). The Rooms... The rooms are large, clean, and everything you would expect from Disney. There is a balcony from every room and the views have been nice in every room I have stayed in. Joined rooms are easy to find if you have a large family or vacationing with a lot of people and the Villas are another great option with 2 bathrooms, a kitchen, a living room, and tons of space for everyone. The Staff... Just like everywhere in Disney, the Staff is helpful, friendly, and always have a smile on their faces. Its a small detail that really does make your vacation even better.

So they are more strict with who gets in the pool. I will say the life guards were more vigilant than any pool I have ever been at. They also have movies on the beach usually at night with a bonfire.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pelham, Alabama", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "wooddale35124", "ReviewID": "UR122590039", "Content": "We stayed at Beach Club Resort the first part of November along with our daughter and her family.

Another nice thing about the location is being able to walk to 2 parks (Epcot and Hollywood Studios) and the Boardwalk. We took the buses to MK, AK and Downtown Disney and did not wait long. We made dinner reservations in a few of the countries which was also very convenient.

I would not normally stay at a Deluxe resort due to the regular cost - even with a Passholder discount its extreme. I got the opportunity to stay at The Beach Club while my sister was attending a seminar there. The hotel is great. The lobby is beautiful and the elevators there are surprisingly fast. The pool is basically the best at Disney - water slides, hot tubs and sand in the bottom of the pool are just some of the features! They offer as many towels as you could possibly need and they some so you don't need to bring a beach towel or take any from the room. Some of the Disney resorts are over the top in the theme but the Beach Club does it tastefully even throwing in some subtle Little Mermaid characters and hidden Mickeys in the carpet. The rooms are decent size, we had plenty of room for three women with a lot of stuff! The bathroom had double sinks which helped with the space there. The housekeeping staff was very nice and attentive to any extras that we needed. The only complaint about the room was that the 'balcony' we had only fit two people - and only if they were standing side by side. This was disappointing after seeing some of the other ones with chairs and tables on them. The best thing about the Beach Club is the location. It is the closest park to Epcot, you could walk there in two minutes. You can also walk (15-20 minutes) or take a boat to Hollywood Studios. You also had access to the restaurants at 4 other hotels, all within walking distance: Yacht Club, Boardwalk, Swan & Dolphin not to mention all the great things at the Boardwalk - ESPN Zone, shops, a piano bar, etc. Couple of complaints, one minor one slightly major. The minor one is the stops when you are riding a bus to the parks. You stop at EVERY resort in the area - 5 stops including your own hotel so the bus rides can take a long time. Some moderate and value resorts have less stops! With the amount of money you pay to stay at this hotel you should get the benefit of fewer stops. The other complaint that I have was with my luggage. I had been staying at the All Star Sports Resort leading up to staying at the Beach Club and Disney transferred my luggage as its common to switch hotels mid-trip. However, they lost my luggage and didn't find it for about 8 hours. I kept checking at the desk and I was told that it wasn't there but a van from All Star had been by. Then I was told it wasn't there and they didn't know where it was, then next it was on a van on its way and back again to not knowing where it was. When the hotel manager (not someone from the bell service) they finally figured it out. It got delivered to the Caribbean Beach Resort despite the fact that it was tagged appropriately. So the van driver as well as the Caribbean Beach people were clearly not paying one bit of attention. The driver for not looking at what he was dropping off and the CB for letting a bag sit there for about 6 hours without it being claimed. The manager was very helpful keeping me updated and offered up any toiletries that I might need but what I really wanted was my jacket as the weather had turned cool. They ended up giving me a credit of $25 on my credit card to make up for it. So, it was an inconvenience but Disney did their best to make it right as they always do.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort!\u201d", "Author": "yellowjacket22", "ReviewID": "UR122242603", "Content": "My children and I are annual passholders and frequent visitors to WDW. Previously though we had never stayed at one of the higher end resorts.

I jumped at the offer. I assumed since I'd gotten such a good deal (less than half the rack rate) we would end up in a room with a parking lot view, but was very pleasantly surprised to get a room with a full balcony and a great view of the water with close access to EPCOT. Contrary to some comments I'd read on here about the rooms being dated, our room was very nice and I noticed no problems at all. It was large and in good repair. As others have noted, the access to EPCOT and Hollywood Studios is well worth staying here. EPCOT in particular with the side entrance was a nice perk. When we entered the park there was absolutely no line for the bag check or the turnstile. We had great luck with the weather also and were able to enjoy the swimming pool and the bonfire. The easy access to the other resorts in the area as well as the boardwalk was a great. We took advantage of some down time and walked around the Boardwalk one night and enjoyed several street performers who were all very good and entertaining. I am a runner and loved the trail to Hollywood Studios and the Boardwalk...great open, uncrowded, no vehicular traffic areas to run. The resort is huge and was a bit of a maze finding our way to our room, but there is good signage and we had not problems at all with it. The maids we had were very friendly and accommodating. If you haven't been by the lobby during Christmas to see the carousel you definitely should drop by; it's second only to the Grand Floridian for Christmas decorations.

THe BC is huge, stretching from a few steps from the International doorway into Epcot (between England and France in the World showcase area) to an area called Stormalong Bay, which is a sandy bottom pool that meanders through slow eddies, waterfalls, under bridges and around a slow moving river like area. Hot tubs and a unique water slide and great sandy, shallow pool kiddie area are included in a space so popular that Disney had to close off the pool to anyone not staying at the Yacht or Beach Club. The Beach Club rooms are large and comfortable. Most have 2 queen beds and some have a daybed that a small child can manage to sleep upon. Beds are comfortable and reasonably firm. No feathers in the bedding, whichis important for allergy sufferers. First floor rooms have a small patio area with 2 chairs and a table, but are not very private. Second, third and fourth floor rooms have balconies, but some balconies are very small and are standing room only - no space for tables or chairs. The garden view rooms on the end near Epcot are convenient to enter Epcot, but are a long walk to the lobby, bus stop to the Magic Kingdom/ Animal Kingdom and boat transporation to Disney Studies. Overall the most convenient rooms are those closest to the lobby and Stormalong BAy. The hotel is comfortable and beautiful with a relaxed, cozy atmosphere that offers a welcome respite from the crowds inside the theme parks. Wifi is supposedly available in the rooms, but I was unable to connect to it despite many tries. My room was very close to Epcot and far from the lobby, so that may be the problem. I am not sure, because I didn't take the time to pursue the issue. The air conditioning worked perfectly and quietly. The bathroom has double sinks outside the toilet and bathtub area. Every room has a mini fridge that you can request them to stock, or that you can fill yourself from groceries available at a small store near the lobby or from the Screen Door at the Boardwalk. There are a number of restaurants at the BC including the Cape May Cafe (buffet) and Beaches and Cream (a 50's style soda and burger place complete with juke box). In addition there are restaurants within walking distance at the yacht club (steakhouse), at the Beardwalk (seafood at The Flying Fish) and at the Swan and Dolphin (Blue, Fresh, etc) as well as numerous places to dine in World Showcase. Nightlife and sidewalk entertainment are a short walk away at the Boardwalk. THis is a great hotel for almost anyone, with facilites for all ages. It is my favorite Epcot area resort, especially for anyone from teenage years and older. The only time that I would recommend a Magic Kingdom (MK) area resort more highly would be if you have small children and expect to spend most of your time in the MK. Then, the Polynesian, or Grand Floridian or Contemporary are great choices.

Very close to Epcot and water taxis to Hollywood Studios, great service on the boats and buses, disney just make everything so easy, I think we were only at the pool 4 times in our visit, the lazy river was too deep for me and my family 8 ft in places not too good if your not a strong swimmer but lots of life gaurds, there is a lovely kids section with sand so that went down well with my kids, they made friends at the pool every time they where there.We loved the movies on the beach each night , Only managed to put kids into kids club once and they loved it and wanted to go back but we ran out of time.We love disney and we would recommend it for a holiday but you could stay at one of their standard hotels and save some money, we have stayed at the animal kingdom 2 years ago and we enjoyed that as well, if you are going to be out all day at the parks stay somewhere cheaper but if you like staying closer to Epcot i would stay here .", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Orleans, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cWill Someone Pick Up the Popsicle Stick\u201d", "Author": "errantmd", "ReviewID": "UR120928777", "Content": "We went to WDW for the Food and Wine Festival and decided to stay at the Beach Club Resort because it is walking distance to Epcot.

Almost as soon as we walking into the room, we spotted problems. There was a Popsicle stick on the floor, toothpaste stains on the bathroom faucet and a large black mascara smudge on the hair drier handle. So I called the front desk and told then the problems. The person on the other end was very apologetic and assured me the problems would be taken care of. So we dashed off to the festival assuming Disney would fix the problem in their usual efficient way. Wrong. When we came back to the room, it was obvious someone had tidied up. But the Popsicle stick, toothpaste stains and mascara smudge were still there. So I cleaned up the stains and the smudge but left the stick to see if it would be picked up during the daily room cleaning. But it was not and it is probably still there. Granted it is under the table but it is very visible to anyone standing in the room. Don't get me wrong. The Beach Club resort is a great place. It is definitely upscale from the moderate hotels.

It was a long line but a gentleman came up to us, asked our name and in 30 seconds he was back with a folder with all we needed and we were off to find our room.

There is a smaller pool area (at the other side of the Beach Club) if you want a quieter place to relax. It is no more than a 5 minute leisurely walk to Epcot back gate. Also 5 more minutes brings you to Boardwalk across the lagoon. Go there in the evening for dinner or snacks. Jelly Roll and the Dance Hall have great entertainment. There are also very good street entertainers throughout the evening outside on the Boardwalk. We ate dinner at the Yachtsman's Steakhouse situated between the Yacht and Beach Club. They have aged beef priced at about $45 for a cut of beef and a potato choice. Any sides or salads are extra.

Overall this is one of the better choices for an on-site Disneyworld hotel, but there are a few drawbacks to bear in mind when deciding whether this is the right choice for you. Arriving ---------- The Beach Club is easy to find. We drove from Sanford International (SFB) using the 417 toll road. It's an easy drive of about an hour on an uncongested two/three lane highway, and cash tolls were less than $10. You can also take the 417 from Orlando International (MCO) which is about a 15 minute drive. Leave at either exit 6 signposted to Disneyworld, or exit 3 for a slightly easier route. Follow signs for Epcot Resorts and you'll be there in a few minutes. When first arriving, security at the hotel car park check their list of guests and then give you a paper parking permit to display in your vehicle. Once you have your room key you can use this to operate the entry barrier. You can self-park, or as we did opt for valet parking at $12 a day. It\u2019s a three minute walk from the hotel entrance to self-parking, but if it is either wet (torrential showers are common), hot and humid, or you have tired kids after a late evening out, valet parking is a lifesaver. Check in was pleasant, quick and efficient. One omission was that we weren't given directions to the room; there is plenty of room number signage in the corridors but none from the lobby. There are lots of helpful hotel staff (\"cast members\" in Disney speak) around to ask for help though, so no problem finding our way. The layout of the hotel is very linear. It makes for the great-looking exterior views you see on the photos, which are just as good in real life, but if your room is at the far end of the hotel it is a long walk from the lobby area. If you have a lot of luggage you might want to use the bell service to have it moved to/from your room, or request a nearer room if walking is a problem. The main bank of four elevators is adjacent to the lobby. They were speedy enough when we stayed on an upper floor last year, but there are only a couple of single elevators at the far end of the hotel which appear to be much slower. Not a problem for us this time as we were given a ground floor room but regularly saw people waiting for them. The Location ----------------- The Beach Club (and Yacht Club, Boardwalk, Swan and Dolphin hotels) is in pretty much the best location for quick and easy access to the Disney theme parks. The Beach Club is right next door to the back entrance to Epcot (International Gateway) and you can find yourself between Britain and France in the Epcot World Showcase section within a couple of minutes of leaving the Beach Club. You can take a free boat from the dock between the Yacht and Beach Club to the Hollywood Studios theme park. These run (at least) every 20 minutes from before park opening until an hour after park closing, and more frequently at busy times. You can be in Hollywood Studios within 15 mins of leaving the hotel and it's a fun and relaxing way to get there, or if you prefer you can walk around the Boardwalk and then alongside the waterway, which would take about 25 mins. The location is also ideal for the free bus service to the other theme parks (Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom and the two water parks). Bus services run on a similar schedule to the boats, and we never had to wait more than 10 or 15 minutes for a bus, which will get you to and from the parks in a further 10 or 15 minutes. Tip: It is definitely worth taking the bus rather than your car to the Magic Kingdom in particular; the bus drops you off right outside the gates in an average of 20 minutes from leaving the hotel lobby. If you drive, it will take more like 45 mins to an hour, as you have to park, take the car park shuttle and then take either the ferry or the monorail to get to the park entrance. Plan your return to avoid just after the parade, fireworks or park closing otherwise you could end up queuing for a bus back. You can easily walk to the Boardwalk area or to the other hotels around the lake in a few minutes, giving you lots of extra eating and drinking options, and the Boardwalk has entertainers wandering around plus a couple of adult-only establishments for drinks and evening entertainment. The Room -------------- There are various grades and views of room available, including a concierge level with various amenities. We booked, and were given, a standard room on the ground floor at the back of the hotel with a view of a fairly dense patch of woodland/trees. Last year we also booked a standard room but were given an upper floor room with a view over the lake and the boardwalk which would have been a higher grade of room than we booked. If the view matters to you, or other details like a full balcony or similar make sure you book the relevant grade of room (at a significant extra cost). If you book the standard room, you might get lucky and get an upgraded room, but equally you could end up with one that overlooks a roof or the car park. These aren't terrible rooms, but the water views are great at night as you can see the Boardwalk all light up across the lake. The upside of our room location (1556) was that it was on the ground floor so no elevators, and directly opposite the exit to one of the small \"quiet\" pools, making it quick and easy to have a quick swim or a dip in the hot tub (on the one day it rained a bit). You can also exit through the quiet pool area and come out even closer to the entrance to Epcot. There were a few potential downsides to the room location. Firstly it is a bit of a hike to the lobby and the main pool area; not a problem for us but worth knowing. Secondly our particular room was right next to the ice machine room, a junction between three corridors, one of the few elevators at that end of the hotel and the aforementioned exit to the quiet pool. We were worried that it would prove very noisy in such a high traffic location, but in reality noise from outside the room wasn't an issue (it was worse last year on an upper floor in what should have been a quieter location). There were a couple of actual issues with the location however. Firstly the patio faced a small walkway which was also used as a service road by golf buggy type vehicles pulling loads of towel/linen carts. The entrance to bring these in and out of the hotel was literally right next to our patio area outside the double doors. Again, noise wasn't actually an issue, but the regular comings and goings of staff outside meant that we had to keep closing the curtains (rather than just the net drapes) whenever we were getting changes or whatever, and what could have been a secluded/private area was not. Secondly the woodland area was clearly a breeding ground for mosquitoes, I guess there were ponds or patches of standing water in there. These were a general nuisance at the this time of the year, but oddly not so much in the height of summer I found. I only got bitten once at the front of the hotel by the main pool, and that was early evening so perhaps to be expected. On the other hand, I only ventured out on to the small patio outside our room on two occasions, once early evening and managed to get bitten five times in about a minute, and once in the middle of the afternoon, again for less than a minute and was bitten twice. The combination of the woods and the shade behind the hotel seems to have made this a hot spot for mosquitoes, so if like me you seem to be the one who always gets bitten, beware. The room itself was a standard Beach Club type room; - Two comfortable double beds. - Wash area with two basins (handy for families). - Bathroom with lavatory, bath and shower over. - Large plasma TV with the usual selection of US TV channels, plus some kid-friendly Disney channels. - Writing/Computer desk with chargeable wired internet access if you wanted it. - Mini-fridge for storing your drinks and snacks. - Plenty of closet and drawer space - far more than we needed. - Coat hooks on the wall plus a pull-out drying line over the bath, handy for wet swimsuits. - Iron/Ironing Board. - Tea/coffee making facilities. - Hairdryer (worked for 10 seconds, then stopped, didn't bother to report as was only trying to dry my shoes out after an afternoon of watery rides!) - Very small key-operated safe in the closet. This is not the usual keypad type that can hold a fair amount of stuff, laptop, etc. You can just about get your documents, money and passports in it, and maybe a phone/iPod or two. Not really up to scratch in this day and age. The main difference from last year's water-view room was that the room was a bit shorter and didn't have the sofa/sofa bed. Nonetheless, the room was fine for sleeping and so on, but not somewhere you could spend a lot of time during the day or evening. We were packing a lot in to our week so sleeping was about all we used the room for, but if you were there for a fortnight and wanted a quiet evening in, it might be a bit limited on space. Housekeeping ------------------ The room was clean and tidy and in good repair and there were no faults or problems to report or deal with. (The basins in our room last year were cracked and in need of replacement, a problem noted by other reviewers). The housekeeping staff was efficient - they usually turned up about 9:00am, and if we weren't out at that time they would come back mid-afternoon instead. The only (minor) disappointment was the lack of towel animals - last year we got a different animal/Disney character made by artfully folding towels and leaving them on the bed, which the kids loved. We got one on the day we checked in, but nothing thereafter (boo). Not sure if this is because we were in one of the most basic rooms or just bad luck (and I did remember to tip!) Amenities ------------ Apart from the location, which is one of the main draws of the Beach Club, the hotel has some really great amenities: - The swimming pool is the best at any WDW property, period. It is almost a mini-water park in itself with three different pool areas and for us is the main draw of the Beach Club. It also serves the adjacent Yacht club and the Beach Club Villas: - A standard swimming pool area, broken in to several sections by curves and bridges. - A mini-lazy river - quite deep so not one for very small kids unsupervised. - A sand-bottomed pool which is large, fairly shallow and loved by kids of all ages. - A fairly big water slide themed as a pirate ship. You actually have to go out to the beach area, climb up the stairs and then ride it over the walkway around the lake and in to the beach club pool. - The whole pool is surrounded by sun loungers, and table/chair/umbrella sets. There was plenty of space in October, but last August finding somewhere to sit was a trial after mid-morning. Too many people putting towels and other items on loungers and then disappearing for four or five hours at a time, despite the signs asking them not to. - The whole thing is nicely themed in a New England/Cape Code style with bridges, a windmill in the middle of the area plus added tropical palm trees and rocky waterfalls. The two shouldn't work together as a concept, but somehow it does. - The pool was open 10:00am-10:00pm (later in summer), illuminated well after dark and extremely well lifeguarded for such a large area. There are also organised activities and games mid-afternoon through early evening. Towels are provided at all the pool entry points. - Entry to the pool area is by room key card only (one per guest including kids), which gets you a wrist band to save you carrying the key around all the time. This is fairly strictly enforced, and with good reason as the pool is so great and it would be easy for non-guests to overcrowd it otherwise as the pool is right next to the lake and only separated by low fences. - There are several other \"small\" pools dotted around the property with adjoining hot tubs, (small by comparison only to the main pool, but perfectly adequate for the handful of people using them each day). These are open longer hours (up to midnight) and have free towels and loungers available, but no life guards on duty. Other amenities: - Disney have just introduced free Wi-Fi access in guest rooms and other areas of the Beach Club (and I understand a number of hotels). Initially this is for a trial period, but I believe it is planned to be offered indefinitely if it works ok. It was fine for us on a laptop and two different smartphones - slightly annoying that one had to log in through the T&Cs page a bit more often than I would like, but otherwise fast and good signal throughout the hotel. - There is a small gym, a token operated arcade games room, a small laundry if you need it. - Concierge service, package delivery if you buy stuff in the Disney Parks, a chargeable kids club in the evening if you want to go out for a meal. - The lobby is fantastic, very much in keeping with the nautical theme of the hotel. Unlike other Disney hotels it does not have over the top theming, so look elsewhere if that is what you want, but it does a great job of transporting you to New England whilst actually being an elegant, airy and fantastically well-designed space. There are plenty of sofas and chairs to sit in, plus a small TV area for kids if you are waiting around for transport or whatever. - The hotel also has a \"solarium\" decorated in a similar style opposite the Marketplace, a good spot to sit and eat breakfast or lunch. - Boat rentals (chargeable) down at the dock area. - Camp fire and evening kids movies on the lakeside beach outside the hotel. Eating & Drinking ---------------------- - There is a beach bar serving soft and alcoholic drinks and light food and snacks open during pool hours.. - Also there 'Beaches and Cream' soda shop; small but perfectly formed. It serves burgers and fries and the like, (including the nicest veggie burgers in Disney), plus ice cream desserts galore. Some are even brave enough to try the 'Kitchen Sink', which is the ice cream equivalent of 'a pint of top shelf' for those who know what that is! - The Beach Club Marketplace sells everything you might want from souvenirs through food and drink to medicines. It also serves pastries and hot breakfast items in the morning, with delicious flatbread pizzas and other hot items for lunch and in to the evening. It can get quite busy at times, but service moves along quickly. - The Cape May Cafe does an expensive (but good) breakfast buffet with character appearances (Goofy, Donald and Minnie in beach attire). In the evening it offers a seafood buffet, not something we would eat as veggies but always seemed packed. The only downside was the stink of fish emanating from it during the evenings (even non-veggies comment on it), but it was fairly localised and easy to avoid. - There is also a small indoor bar area for drinks and light snacks in the evening. - There are probably over a dozen other eating options within a 10 minute walk at the Boardwalk and the other hotels around the lake, so you are bound to find something suitable. - If not, you can be in Epcot World Showcase in five minutes and there are about a gazillion different table and fast food-options in there. - Plus when we stayed the Epcot food and wine festival was on, so we ate snack-sized portions of delicacies everywhere from France to Mexico via every country in between, plus German beers (as good as the stuff in Bavaria), and Margaritas (not so good). Really glad it wasn't too far to walk back after all that! Issues -------- - Mosquitoes - mentioned above. - Hairdryer - mentioned above. - Apart from that, the only other thing was that the hotel was undergoing external renovations when we stayed - largely sanding, filling and painting. To be fair, we were aware of this before we visited, and the management also informed people by way of a note in the room. When we stayed they were mostly working on the outside of the solarium, which meant a few take-out meals were afflicted by the sound of power tools and the strong smell of paint. Work was limited to between 9 and 5, but I could imagine it being very annoying if one had been out late the night before and all that kicked off outside my window. Being realistic, the whole hotel consists of vast areas of beautifully painted woodwork which looks absolutely pristine despite the age of the building. I can only imagine what it would look like in the Florida climate if Disney weren't willing to invest large sums of money in keeping it up to scratch. It didn't cause us a major problem, but worth checking when this all finished before you go if it would bother you overly. Overall Impression ----------------------- We really like this hotel, and were keen to go back after our first trip. It is pretty expensive by any standards though. If judging it purely on the price vs. the quality and size of the room I'd rate it two and a half to three out of five at best, because it is four star accommodation at greater than five star prices. What pushes it up in my view is: - The exterior of the hotel and the location on the lake are fantastic. If you took away all the 'Disney' elements, this would still be one of the most fantastic hotels to look at or out of. - The wide range of family friendly amenities, in the hotel, near the hotel and easily accessible across the whole of WDW, and especially the fabulous pool. - Unbeatable service from the hotel staff. They really do their best to make you feel welcome and to help. Sure, it is pretty clear they are drilled in the 'Disney' way of providing customer service, but it results in people who actually seem to care about what their customers want and who make sure everyone is having the best time they possibly can. - The convenience of staying on a Disney property; free transport across the whole empire, the ability to charge everything to your room key and just get one credit card transaction at the end (saving on fees), extra hours in the theme parks just for Disney guests and the chance to get free Disney dining plans if you go at the right time. Would we go back to the Beach Club again? Absolutely. That said, I'd like to try some of the other Disney hotels to see what they are like, but I hesitate as I worry they would not live up to the great experiences we have had at the Beach Club.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Magnolia,Delaware", "Title": "\u201cWhat a great Resort!!!!\u201d", "Author": "nulyte", "ReviewID": "UR119984813", "Content": "My mother planned a family vacation for our entire family and wanted to stay on property where we have never stayed before.

As my solo trip to the Food and Wine Festival would require multiple trips into Epcot, the Beach Club was the practical choice this time around. People rave about this hotel so I was eager to try it out. Unfortunately my check in experience was less than magical. I had 3 questions that I had intended to ask at the concierge desk but as no one was in line behind me I just decided to ask Pete, the Cast Member who was checking me in. Big mistake. First I asked if I needed to sign a release to use the 24 hour fitness center. Pete said no but did not offer to give me the 24 hour card that I later found out that I needed to get from the check in desk. My second question regarded the beachside movies that were playing at the other resorts. I have inquired about this in the past and it seemed a simple matter for Cast Members to pull up the information. However, Pete apparently was not aware of where to find this information online and thought I wanted him to call all 24 resorts and ask what movies they were playing. He started by getting on the phone to All Stars and working his way down the list. When I realized what he was doing I tried to stop him and reinerate that I only wanted to know the movies playing at the resorts with beaches (Polynesian, Contemporary, Grand Floridian, and Boardwalk) and that I was pretty sure there was a place where it could be found online in their system. He ignored what I was saying, called Animal Kingdom Lodge, and asked his coworker to start calling the Coronado (neither of which have beaches). Obviously Pete was determined to punish me by making me stand there while he called all 24 resorts. I was stunned. I said \"Look, you've proved your point, I'm sorry I asked\" and I began to walk away without daring to ask my third question (1st bus arrival time on Extra Magic Hours morning..guess I should have started with the simplest question first). Pete widened his eyes, spread his arms and said \"I'm only trying to help\" in a phoney, overly solicitous manner, like I was too stupid to recognize sarcasm. Wow, Fortunately, when I went to Guest Services at Downtown Disney, a charming Cast Member named Laurent not only pulled up the movie schedules for the requested resorts in seconds but gave me printouts for the whole week's schedule unasked. The Beach Club has many positives, the greatest of these being walking access to Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studio. The 24 hour fitness center and the path around Cresent Lake are great for early risers' workouts or jogs. The sand bottom in the pool is a nice, beachy touch. The biggest negative (well, besides Pete) is the shared bus system. When I returned from Downtown Disney I believe the stops were Downtown Disney Marketplace, Pleasure Island, Typhoon Lagoon, the Swan, the Dolphin, the Boardwalk, the Yacht Club, and the Beach Club. While I understand the logistics of why Disney does this, it makes for long travel times, inconvenient waits, and often very crowded buses for their guests. There were a few minor things that did not affect me but might be of note to others. Construction is going on at the Beach Club so currently guests shouldn't count on being able to take any afternoon naps. My standard room had a balcony that was only big enough to step out on, no room for a chair. A rather odd design; if you're going to have a balcony on a room, why not extend it out far enough to be useable? So I would say if a view or a seat on your balcony is important to you, invest in a more upscale room and ask specifically what you are getting. The two sinks, tub, and toilet were all enclosed in the bathroom. It seems like it would be more useful for the facilities to be separated so more than one person could get ready at the same time. Also the bathroom door almost grazes the toilet when you close the door which can be awkward. My room had an adjoining door to the room next to mine so while this could account for a larger noise factor, other than one noisy entrance at 2am, my neigbors were mercifully quiet. In summary I can see the appeal of the resort to familes with kids due to the large pool area but frankly I never lost the feeling that I was in a hotel. I would be inclined to recommend the Wilderness Lodge or the Animal Kingdom Lodge for character over the Beach Club. Even though these two are expansive, there are areas tucked away like overlooks with rocking chairs or alcoves with fireplaces and comfy couches that give them a homey feel. These resorts generally also share a bus with only one other resort. One last piece of advice, if you are checking in and Pete is the next available Cast Member, let the person behind you go first!

This can be strictly enforced, as even our 2 year old had to have a room key one of the times we used the pool. It depends who is on duty I guess. Even though there were lots of people it is so spacious & spread out you don't feel crowded. Pool bar, awesome. Try the tropical Mojito, and relax. Quiet pools on the other side of hotel, also large & spacious, hot tub big enough to meet a few people and not feel uncomfortable. Plenty of tables & umbrellas, and chairs etc...We love how you are literally within walking distance of Epcot, so you can walk over & watch the Illuminations fireworks each night. We also walked to boardwalk, for dinner one night, and for bakery goodies to carry back to the room. Cape May restaurant on site has a fabulous seafood buffett, worth the money, and save room for those tiny desserts, they are heavenly, well worth the calories. So far this is our favorite resort, and we have stayed at Polynesian, Port Orleans Riverside, Carribean Beach, Old Key West, and Wilderness Lodge. The closeness to Epcot just tips it for some reason. We look forward to trying other resorts but will always come back to this one!", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cBeware Club Level\u201d", "Author": "Funforthesun", "ReviewID": "UR118237689", "Content": "CLUB LEVEL: Standard Rooms Club Level = Roof top view, ridiculous.

This time was opposite. The sand bottom pool & acres of it is relaxing and fun. Our kids are of different age groups and loved trying everything. Our youngest 4 loved the 2 foot area with the buckets and pails for building sandcastles with dad. i might add that this was his (my husbands) favourite section as well. not a big swimmer. My other 2 children loved the pirate slide, waterfalls (also with dad.) jumping in the 8ft deep waters as i floated around the lazy river watching them. the daily games and activities everyday were a big hit especially the volleyball net with my teenage son.. We unfortunately couldnt' visit one day because of bad weather one day but were able to enjoy a smaller pool which was like d just as much. The Cape May restaurant was our first stop when we arrived. We got the magical express just in time as we almost missed a wonderful breakfast buffet and pics with characters. On another evening we chose to visit hurricane hannas not over the top excitement but good enough for hotdogs poolside. Another evening we chose to enjoy cape may again. My husband went especially for the crab legs and was not disappointed. My son was excited to see Portuguese octopus stew. one of his faves at home by his grandmother. i loved the kids section for my girls. can't get enough chicken nuggets and fries,. the carved beef was lovely. Good service as well. The room with day bed nice and spacious for a family five. not always easy to find especially as the kids get older. It was always nice to always have 5 of everything (ie. towels) that doesn't always happen either.

I've been in a couple of old New England seaside resorts. The Beach Club does a great job recreating the look and feel. Our room was comfortable, immaculate and spacious - by far the largest room we've had at Disney. We found the best eating was next door, at the bar beside the Yacht Club's steak house. They had very good food and a fair selection of beers. Our one complaint was the parking. If you don't use the valet service, be prepared to walk. Guest parking is over by the villas, so you have to haul your bags a fair distance to get back to check-in. The Beach Club is pricey.

We actually preferred it to The Grand Floridian! Beach Club has the most amazing pool we've ever seen. Too bad we were too busy to use it every day. We also loved the proximity to Epcot. This made the evening dinners so easy, and we were able to choose some fabulous restaurants in Epcot like Teppan Edo and San Angel Inn. Hollywood Studios was also a short boat ride away, which we found convenient. The bus service to Beach Club is pretty poor, however. We shared buses with the Swan, The Dolphin, and The Boardwalk resorts - this meant lots of standing, and we went at a fairly uncrowded time of year (end of August)! It also seemed as if our bus line was often the longest and no buses came, where 2 or 3 buses would have come for other (lesser) resorts! This was irritating, as we felt that we paid top dollar for our resort and we should have better bus service. The Cape May Cafe in the Beach Club was our least favorite meal of the week, unfortunately. Also, the Club Level food was not that good, and not varied at all. Still, we did like the convenience of breakfast on the Club Level (and a few beers helped on a couple of evenings!). The room was fairly clean. We found some crusts of bread under the dust ruffle of a bed....kind of yucky, but overall it was O.K. The room was good size for 5 of us, and the daybed was perfect for our youngest. The lobby is very pretty - great for some family photos! Overall, Beach Club is a lovely resort. The pool is the best we've seen, and the location for Epcot and Hollywood Studios is great. The price was very high, but I guess that's Disney! We would stay here again if we go back to Disney, but we did prefer the Universal Resorts for the money. Hard Rock was awesome and half the price. Their Club Level service was also superior.

This was my first time staying in a WDW Deluxe hotel, so I was really expecting a lot. Most of my expectations were met. Our trip was planned for us to spend the majority of our time in Epcot, so that is the main reason we chose the Beach Club. It is a five minute walk to the back entrance of Epcot--the International Gateway, which is located between the France and UK pavilions. For this reason, we also requested a room as close to the Epcoot end of the resort as possible, and that request was granted. The Beach Club and Yacht Club resorts are basically combined, they share an amazing pool-one of the best on Disney property, for sure. It has a lazy river, shipwreck slide, and a sandy bottom! The Beach Club is also a short walk to the Boardwalk resort and entertainment area, which has several restaurants and a couple of nightspots. You can also walk or catch a boat into Hollywood Studios, and the Swan and Dolphin Hotels. Lots of options closeby. The only thing I was disappointed in were a few maintanence issues with our room. One of the closet doors was completely off when we got there, but was fixed the next day. Also, in the bathroom, the door actually rubbed against the toilet everytime it was opened. The shower sprayed water all over the floor, and when I tried to adjust it, I discovered a half-dollar sized hole where the pipe went into the wall.

When we arrived, the staff was courteous but had a very difficult time finding a place for us and stated that with 1 child listed and 3 adults they thought the two queens would work out. Not a good response especially since the adult 6ft 2 other child was standing there. They did find a room for us but it was not ready until 5 p.m and we arrived well before noon. The room we were given was not in the gardens section but rather in the woods section -not an issue except that the maintenance and environment were not up to disney standards. There was power washing and scrapping with a \"tree picker\" apparatus --every week day--and while this family is used to construction noise -the resulting dirt, caulk, etc was not cleaned off of our balcony everyday. Inside the room, the towel rack kept falling down and the cleaning service on the 4th day just put it on top of the dresser. (I would have assumed the first day that the cleaning staff would have notified the maintenance staff that there was a repair to be made). One sink had faucets that were not on correctly and therefore did not operate well. There was a hole in the shower directly under the on/off knob. Our door to the hallway did not close upon exiting the room unless one of us stood on the inside of the room and pulled back the latch while another of us inserted the room key. And while They paid for the lost item, I was not impressed when a pair of earrings I had put in a glass with a note underneath stating not to empty, were missing but the note was still there. The final irritation is that the instructions printed and provided to us regarding luggage for our express check out did not follow the guidance given by our travel agent: we followed her guidance but when wetried to confirm with the bell boy staff, we received multiple and conflicting guidance from several people standing at the same desk at the same time. Suggest that even if the \" the instructions change all the time\" as I was told, that instructions are divided into those using express and luggage check out and airport check in at the resort and those who are not. Go green and just print on two sides ot the same piece of paper. Maintenance and staff knowledge definitely a pause for concern. But the great pool and restaurants and walking distance to EPCOT outshadowed the not so good about the room. Big issue is that your Beaches and Cream inside seating area is TOO SMALL to accomodate the number of folks who want to sit down and it is confusing when you walk up. Suggest that you take some of the area of the gameroom and use it for beaches and cream seating. Walk up pool side grill ---great; pool and lifeguards --fantastic; captain's grill --great; cape may restaurant --great for characters and buffet; yachtmans steakhouse--go back to good steak dinners and stop with the phoo phoo dressings and sides. Bathrooms on main floor/lobby area need cleaning more often. Gift shop should be the gift shop and you need to move the grill and restaurant part out of there. IT takes forever just to get a slice of pizza because there is not enough room for more than 2 people. Gift shop still nice! and like the availability of snacks.

A short walk from Epcot and just across from the Boardwalk restaurants and stores. The pool was huge and beautiful with a pirate ship and a slide which goes into one of the pools. The water is very warm in the pool. There is a waterfall at one end of the pool, and an area where you can get lifejackets for children, tubes to float around on in another pool, and other pool items. The pool was refreshing on a warm day. There are activities at the pool daily which such as different contests and games. The staff are from different countries and are very friendly and helpful wherever you go. The marketplace in the hotel is the quick service area for breakfast, lunch, and a quick dinner which you can use for your dining plan if you are on one. In the morning it is very crowded as guests run to get refills of coffee for their breakfasts before setting out for the parks. The marketplace is also a gift shop which sells drug items, clothes, and souvenirs you may need to pick up. The hotel's landscape was very nice and the hotel inside was very clean. The lobby is spacious and resembles a Capecod seaside resort with comfortable chairs and a laid back atmosphere. The hotel has a buffet at breakfast and a seafood buffet dinner which appeared to be very popular and crowded. Our room had two queen size beds with a balcony with a view of the front of the hotel which was very nice. The room contained a day bed which another person was able to sleep on. It held five of us. There were double sinks and one bathroom. Our maid supplied us with enough towels and cleaned our room nicely and changed our linens when requested. The Yacht club is connected to this hotel and you can quickly move from one hotel to the next by connecting walkways outside. You can eat at the other hotel's restaurants which are very good as well. We ate at the Captains Grille twice for dinner and enjoyed our meals very much. The hotel does cater to children and my children loved the artist of the day contests and the stickers and coloring books given to them at the front desk. The staff go out of their way to make children feel welcome. There are probably more children at the hotel than adults. The Disney bus service to the parks can be picked up in front of the hotel and run every 20 minutes. This was really nice as you do not have to do the driving and the buses are very cool and air-conditioned. The only complaint was that there were not enough washing machines working at the hotel when we had to do laundry. For such a large hotel this can be an inconvenience when alot of people need to wash their clothes. Other than that, this was a terrific hotel and added greatly to our traveling experience.

Having stayed at the Disney Port Orleans last year, we really wanted to go back again this year but wanted to try a Deluxe hotel, as opposed to one of their moderate hotels. We got the Free Dining Plan as we went in August ( please read tipping note below though !). The balcony was not very big at all (if this concerns you then check !) as I had expected something that my husband and I could sit out on when the children needed to catch up on their sleep ! ( Like I had seen in the brochure). You could only stand 1 person on it, and the door automatically shut !! I did ring down to be told that their were no more rooms available that night, but they may be able to move us tomorrow ( after a nine hour flight plus other travelling time I really didn't fancy unpacking to change rooms again !). The bell hop arrived and as we mentioned our upset with the balcony he said the room being in a corner was bigger than most standard rooms, and if we moved to another room tomorrow if would be much smaller. As I am disabled and had a wheelchair to accommodate we decided to stay with the room we had for the sake of space !! and less hassle !! Need to mention though - the bed was v.comfortable, we has 2 queen sized beds in our room. Flat screen TV good. Coffee making facilities - horrid ! - we went downstairs in the lift to the Marketplace and got coffees in our refillable cups instead. Note - there is a decent sized fridge though, and a very small safe in the wall in your room ! ( I mean Small ) ! Coat hangars ( yes, they brought more in 15 mins) but when will they realise a family room needs more than 10 or so hangars !! ( I had the same issue last year). Negatives to this hotel ; 1. Disney have changed their policy this year , and where as before in Deluxe hotel you got FREE wi-fi in the room, NOW you have to pay !! Having gone last year and asked about the Wi-Fi policy and not been told of the change we were expecting if to be free in a Deluxe hotel !! The only time we really NEEDED this was when trying to check info. on the launch of Juno we wanted to go and see at Cape Canaeveral. I now this change of policy upset quite a few people staying at the hotel though ! My husband was rather expecting to be able to use his Smart Phone in the hotel and I wasn't willing to pay the price ! 2. Whilst the lobby area and pools/gardens etc are immaculate, I did feel that it had been a LONG time since our bedroom had been cleaned properly, very dusty carpets under the desk, down the sides of the bedside cabinets etc, edges of carpets. 3. Would benefit from more tables to use to eat a counter service breakfast at in the morning, as the few available outside and in the solarium soon got taken, meaning you had to to back to your room or eat on the go if busy, There is a hotel restaurant for breakfast, but as it is a character breakfast in the Cape May Cafe which is great but we couldn't afford that every day !! 4. There was repainting and sanding going on externally whilst we were there that we didn't know of in advance, it didn't affect us though...but we did over hear some people it had. The sanding at 9am was a bit noisy mind !! Positives ;- 1. An excellent hotel along with the Yacht Club ( next door) for position. A 5 minute walk to Epcot, and very quick to get in at these turnstyles at the top end of the park ! very quiet entrance. Made it very easy to eat out in some gorgeous restaurants in Epcot in an evening if not wanting to spend all day in the parks, and then come out and watch the Epcot fireworks at 9pm (every night). Nice walk to Epcot too ! Could also walk to the Boardwalk in 5-10 mins ( across the water from the hotel), where magicians would pop up and entertain people on the boardwalk, as well as other venues being situated here. A nice walk ( or bike ride) after dinner if dining in the hotel too ! 2. Pool area. brilliant if you have children. Not noisy, just lively in a nice way. Lots of lifeguards. Plenty of seats. the different areas of the pool, lazy river etc were lovely. This bit in the brochure is to be believed ! 3. Dining in the hotel if you like seafood ( buffet) is lovely ! Kids loved it too !! The Steak Restaurant in the Yacht Club - what can I say, the steak was divine !! Gets very busy, so book ! We tried to go to the Beaches and Cream Ice Cream parlour but the wait to get in ( they have a waiting list at busy times !) was just too long so we just got ice cream to go ! and ate it at a table around the pool area ! When a cloud blows over everyone has the same idea !! Kids were a bit gutted, but it's not that big inside !! 4. Films on the beach (what a cute idea)! Deckchairs were set out on the beach area every night and a different Disney film played on a huge inflatable screen ! Really nice, although I watched from the pathway as I was in a wheelchair ! (not too good on sand !). 5. Boat ride to Hollywood Studios was great ! and quite quick. Made for a quick escape after the ''Fantasmic'' performance ( do the Dinner Package! well worth it)....back in no time ! This hotel is a sure fire winner for location and its super pool complex keeping both the children and the adults happy. We did have a rental car as we flew from the UK into Sanford airport so needed transport and intended on doing the odd Mall trip, the Juno launch at Cape Canaeveral and Sea World and Discovery Cove on this visit, so was worth hiring a car. When in Disney though we just let them do the driving and used their transportation system ! Its' a BIG place!! much more relaxing and easier to let them take you round their parks for free and buses and boats were pretty frequent and queues never got too big. Just leave plenty of time if you have say a character breakfast at Tusker House to get to in Animal Kingdom ( it's a fair trip !), but well worth it ! The Yacht Club ( next door to the Beach Club ) is more expensive to book from the UK , ? why ?? Do they all have bigger usable balconies at the Yacht Club ? Other than that we weren't sure why the difference ! Staff - all very friendly and helpful. ONE MOAN though - the TIPPING system. A 'suggested' tip of 15% or 18% on a food bill in Disney is NOT CHEAP! We got the Meal Plan for Free going in August, but some restaurants are 'double your entitlements', so called Signature restaurants ! Yes, the food was v. nice, but BE PREPARED FOR THE TIP THEY EXPECT !! Only parties of 6 or more HAVE THE TIP ENFORCED, but the face of the waiters ( some, but not all) says it all when you leave a reasonable tip ! Be prepared for this !! If not careful you could have a bill of 100s of $ at the end of a 2 week stay due to to tipping expected !! I think they are used to American's staying a few nights ( not 2 weeks) !! and leaving bigger tips. PS. Discovery Cove is amazing, but be aware it is open 'whatever the weather' ! We had a fab dolphin encounter, but an hour later the sky went dark and stayed like that for the rest of the day ! (from 10am onwards!) top tip. get there early ! to reduce impact of any mid/ late afternoon storms on your dolphin swim. Overlall, we had an amazing time and the customer service is second to none. We always feel so safe in Disney and can just relax ! We would go back again - would check out the Yacht Club too....a bigger balcony would have been nice ! From asking around the pool other people got their rooms changed for other ones when checking in too....there seem to be a variety or rooms !", "Date": "September 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Uckfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel but needs more \"life\"\u201d", "Author": "dwfco", "ReviewID": "UR117539888", "Content": "We spent two weeks here in August.

This was our first visit to the beach club and although nothing bad happened, I just wasnt that impressed. I got a good rate for our garden view room, but I would never pay $350-$400 a night here. Yes the location is great, but you can stay at the swan & dolphin for cheaper in the same location. Some might think my complaints are petty, but again at a resort charging high prices I expect these things. Room: Housekeeping was not good........2nd day had to call and request more shampoo (that should have been replenished) 3rd night needed to call for more towels, 4th day our room was never made up mainly b/c housekeeping never came before 1:00 and we decided to take a 2 hour nap. Also, they were doing renovations right outside our room during the day which would have been a problem if I had a baby trying to nap. The one day I had ponchos out on the balcony to dry and returned home to sand dust ALL over them. It would have been nice if they told us they would be sanding and not to put things out on the balcony. Pool: It was cool, the kids loved the sand at the bottom & the waterslide was great. However, the area is so big that to get from one area of the pool to the other you almost have to get out and walk over bridges, etc. Also, the walk from the pool to the waterslide is far enough to where I would have never let my 4 & 6 year old go by themselves. Just not convenient for those with small kids. The lazy river was 7-8ft deep basically forcing you into renting a tube. Overall up keep: At Hurricane Hanna's there really needs to be a worker cleaning and wiping off tables. The benches near the buses had dead little bugs on them, again things you shouldnt see at a $350-$400 a night resort. Marketplace: Food was fine however, there was no place to sit down and eat it.

Housekeeping continues to be good although the carpet was not vacuumed every day but the sheets were changed. Plenty of towels, etc., but that coffee in those packs in the room tastes TERRIBLE IMO..don't bother. Overall, building maintenance remains good (they were painting the exterior while we were there). The pool is, I think, the very BEST pool at ANY Disney property, bar none. Lots of pool activities every day for the kids such as bingo, hula hoop contests, make your own ice cream, etc. The Hurricane Hannah grill gets VERY busy around lunchtime and I thought the service was a little slower than usual...probably because they could have used a couple more staff members. We dined throughout the park in various venues (we did not use the dining plan) and overall were pleased with food quality especially in the sit-down restaurants such as the Cape May Cafe (the buffet nighttime meal); the California Grill at the Contemporary (try the flatbread appetizers..great) and, of course, there is no place better than Beaches and Cream at the Beach Club for ice cream.

Before we got there I kept telling them how great the resort would be. A list of small issues involving different people caused us to regret staying there. Each issue by itself would not have been a big deal, but it was the cumulative effect that caused the disappointment with our stay. 1. Even though all luggage has unique numbers on it, the bellman brought us someone else's luggage with the same last name when we checked it. 2. The standard room with pool/water view and balcony we reserved had a balcony the size of a pizza box. The water view (of the lake) is mostly blocked by tree's. This was room 4667. 3. After requesting a new room, a very helpful front desk gentleman arranged for us to move to a new room the next day. We were told that we could pack our bags in the morning, leave them in the room, notify the bellman to pickup the bags and store them and when we returned from the park we would then check-in to our new room. When I asked the bellman to pickup the bags, they politely said I would need to go wait in the room. A manager overrode this and we left for the park. When we returned at 4:00, and if it wasn't for this event, I would not be writing this review, I went to the front desk to pickup our new room keys. I informed the person at the front desk that I was supposed to have a room change and need to pickup my new keys. His first question was \"did you speak to anyone about this?\", as if I was doing this on m own. I told him that I had and that it was supposed to be all arranged. After about 5 minutes on the phone with someone, he pulls out a map of the resort and starts to tell me that the room is fine and has a water view. I reminded him that there was no need to discuss this and that all of my bags had already been packed up to prepare for the move to the new room. More time goes by and I asked him what the issue was. All I got was a dirty look. He then started giving me an attitude and finally created the new room keys and just handed them to me. No mention of where the room was. When we got to the room, the cleaning staff was in it. 4. On the way to the new room, a very nice bellman got our bags out of storage and we were telling him we had spent too much time at the front desk and were running late for a 5:30 dinner at Cinderella's Castle. He said they could arrange for a car service for us instead of the buses that we were using to get to the parks. I thought this was great as I didn't want my daughters to miss their dinner. What he didn't tell me or maybe know, was that cabs drop you off pretty far away from the entrance to the Magic Kingdom. So far in fact, that you have to take a monorail from that point to get to the park. The buses would have easily been faster and at no cost. 5. After the room change, my wife realized she left a purse in the room and asked if it had been turned in to Lost and Found. She was told no purse was turned in. I met someone at the room and looked for the purse and could not find it. My wife had given a detailed description of the purse she was looking for. A few hours later we received a message stating they would look for the purse, but need a description of it. The next day we received the purse back. It had been in the Lost and Found the whole time. First we were told they looked in the wrong room for the purse, which was not true since I was there with them looking for it, and then they said it had been in the lost and found the whole time. The Beach Club is a nice resort and as I've stated I've stayed there before, but this trip didn't show what they are capable of. For nearly $500/night I expect a little more.

We chose the Beach Club for its proximity to Epcot and great pool. We had a wonderful stay! Arrival: We arrived by Magical Express to a busy lobby. We had done the online check-in, and the line moved quickly. Our room wasn't ready yet (11:00 am), so we went to check out the pool. They check for room keys at every entrance to the pool. The cast member at the pool entrance was very helpful and told us where we could change. We swam and had lunch before finding out at 2 that our room was ready. The Pool: Yes, it's as great as everyone says. We like water parks and have been to many hotel pools. But the atmosphere at this one was wonderful. There were lots of people, but we never felt crowded; parents were with their kids and everyone was there to relax. The pool area is a bit like a maze, with lots of pathways and bridges. At first I thought that this was a downside, as there was no one place where I could sit and watch the 2 boys in the different pool areas. But this turned out to be a plus--why would I want to sit down anyway, when I could be swimming in the pool? The sandy bottom is amazing and felt wonderful after long walks in the parks. With so many different areas and passages, everyone could spread out. We bought 2 noodles for $4 on our first day and used them throughout the week, then passed them on to another family when we left. My younger son (6) appreciated the free lifejacket that we borrowed all week. The room There were 5 of us in the room (my mom stayed with us). The room was quite large and worked out fine. My older son pronounced the daybed very comfortable, and we always had plenty of towels and bath supplies. I was disappointed at first to have only the Juliet balcony, but it was so hot our week that I don't know how much sitting on a balcony I would have done. There were 4 large drawers and 4 smaller ones, a good-sized closet, and a space to store a suitcase. The double vanity was big and had room underneath to store items. Someone could change in the vanity area without being in view of the rest of the room, another plus. Housekeeping was fine. Our non-preferred room had a courtyard view and was just three doors down from the elevator, which helped to minimize our walking. And the elevators were fast and easy. The public parts of the hotel Wow, wow, wow! On our last stay at Caribbean Beach I felt a little--lost, because our room was so far from anything. We were far from lost here. The lobby was always busy, and yet there were always places to sit. I had worried that it would feel fussy, but everyone was relaxed. I will say that the Marketplace is on the small side, in keeping with the rest of the reviews. And the ice machine for the free mug refills was having a rough week. (Like I said, it was hot!) But the staff there were always nice and explained the dining plan details. Even though it was crowded, there were never lines. The beach area is lovely. We went out to watch a movie there one night. At first it seemed silly, to go and watch a movie at Disney World...but our youngest son was so keyed up after fun in the parks that the movie was a nice way for him to wind down. Again, it was relaxed and friendly, with staff playing tag with kids further down the beach. We realized the true value of the Beach Club on a rainy night. All of the lifeguards and activities staff came indoors, and several set up shop in the Solarium. They had board games, coloring pages, and showed a movie indoors. It would have been a miserable evening to spend in a hotel room...the fun staff really brightened it up. There were many thunderstorms during our stay, and the pool closed, but the staff was prompt with reopening as soon as possible. Location This was the reason why we went with the Beach Club. We could walk to Epcot. We could have walked to Hollywood Studios, but no one else wanted to try it, so we took the boat instead. Boat transportation stopped at other resorts but was fairly even and dependable. Buses to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom arrived quickly at our resort--we never waited very long. The ride back from AK was a little crowded, as that bus served all of the Epcot area resorts, but we managed. At least the air conditioning was cold. To sum up, the Beach Club was the perfect spot for our family.

Good thing about staying is you are a couple of hundred yards from Epcot and the nightly fireworks. It is a must see you can walk there with no problem at all. The pool was packed but the kids had fun they have a long waterslide and a little one for the young ones. The bid slide is not built for a grown man as you will see if you use it you will feel every seam on the way down. The kids loved it. We used the boat taxi almost everyday to go to Hollywood Studios if you want to do the Toy Story ride you need to get there early we did four three days and had a half hour wait. I would get and in line and the wife got a fast pass while I waited and then we went the first time and would come back in an hour or so after we got done and go again. It was our favorite ride. The food plan is confusing til you catch on to what you get. Get as much as you can for Breakfast and what drinks you don't use you can take to park and or put in the fridge in your room. ie the kids breakfast you can get frosted flakes milk and a drink we would get a water or oj and take with us. Not all places to use your meal plan have the plan identified on their menu so ask. That is what we did do not assume you can't eat there we found most of the places we could eat there. We flew in at night I would not recommend this as the kids were wiped for two days after. We got to our room about 1 am. We got in earlier but were about the last drop off from the people on the bus. It you don't get the food plan lunchs dinners and ect will run 50- 80 bucks. We did the morning breakfast with the Characters in the motel the kids loved it . However it cost like 150.00 bucks for a family of five seperate from the food plan. Must sees I would say are the parades, fireworks, Toy Story, The Loin King was a great show we sat in the front row and it was awesome the kids got taken out and were involved in the show. All in all had a great time on the way it took us an hour to get security at the Orlando airport. Disney got us there like 2 hours before now I know why.

I must say, when I booked this resort for our family of five for a week, I was not sure if I was going to like it. I live in the northeast, so staying at a beach club resembling Cape May or Martha's Vineyard was a vacation spot my family would enjoy on weekends, not something I would pay $$$$ and drive 18 hours to reach! I wondered how this resort would compare with the magic disney offers at their other resorts. Well... It was not love at first sight but a very subtle to an exploding, wishes fireworks, kind of love... When we arrived the gateman asked our name and was very kind when he said welcome home:) When we pulled in front to unload our luggage and check in, Samantha greeted us by using our family name and walked me inside to the front desk, I held back tears, (This trip we had a garden view room however I have stayed concierge level at other WDW resorts and we were never greeted like this.) It went down hill from there yet I can not blame the cast members at the BC but the misinformation I was given from the call center when the reservation was made. To make a long story short, we added a day to the beginning of our trip, so this gave us two separate reservations which in turn we had to switch rooms on our second day. Forgive me, but I can not remember her name but she works at the front desk and has dark skin with dark medium length hair and she was AWESOME!!!!!!! She searched and searched the rooms at BC, made calls but the resort was at full capacity and could not get us into a room we didn't have to move. She said to see her in the morning, she arrives at 8:00a.m. and I will not be disappointed. That night I called over to the Polynesian to check availability and was all set to leave BC for the remainder of our trip in the morning. We couldn't unpack anyway and I was reluctant about this resort from the beginning. Morning came and I said, lets give BC one more try today... it was the best decision I made all trip. Dark haired girl gave us the most fabulous room, ground level just a few steps away from Epcot AND it was ready by noon! Thank you, thank you, thank you dark haired girl! Our room was fabulous, spotless and whatever we requested from housekeeping we were given. Throughout our stay our teenage boys enjoyed the fitness club and the pool area and Cape May Cafe (best mac and cheese in the world) for dinner, beaches and cream for milkshakes and sundays and the pool area restaurant for burgers and hotdogs. Everything from food quality to service was exceptional! The restrooms by the pool area are spotless and the waitstaff is great when you don't want to get up from your lounge chair. Everyday we had a different question for concierge and everyday we had someone different who answered our questions so pleasantly without making us feel we were a bother... (you know the song, \"Be Our Guest\" ?? this must be their motto/philosophy.) I can not put into words how grateful I am for the service we received when we stayed at the Beach Club.

We were up and about to leave each day but I am sure some people do not want to be bothered that early. Now back to room service. The price was that of any room service, outrageuous, but also took about 45 minutes to get to our room. I wonder why it took so long at 11pm at night. The hotel has a nice market with all of the items you may need on your trip, food, coffee, clothing, eye solution, you name it, they had it. I would also reccomend the $15 plastic mug. While on property you can fill it up with soft drinks or coffee whenever you choose. We went to 4 parks but i will not bore you with those details, All in all, this was a very nice resort and I would reccomend it to family, singles, etc. We would stay here again the next time we visit Disney.", "Date": "August 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenville, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cUpgraded to Club Level.....WOW!!\u201d", "Author": "Lori S", "ReviewID": "UR116137577", "Content": "I have stayed here a couple of time before, in addition to many other Disney Resort hotels, but I have never been upgraded to Club Level.

You might expect this area to employ the most talented team of professionals, and I did not find this to be the case. They were friendly, however, and that's always a good thing. The food was substantial enough for you not to have to buy your meals on property or in the park. Food and beverages were being served most of the time throughout the day, and that was a welcome surprise. The room was lovely, with all the usual amenities, and I even had a small balcony overlooking the pool. I was only there for two nights during the EPCOT Flower and Garden festival, mainly to see the presentation of one of the HGTV design professionals, and this was an amazing event!

It takes 5 minutes to walk to Epcot and 15 to Disney's Hollywood Studios. The Beach Club and the Yacht Club share the same pool area but have two different lobbies.

We booked a standard club level room. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a junior suite at no cost! We love how each room has a wonderful outdoor area-in our case it was a small patio as we were ground floor. It is very worth going club level. Some debate this but we love it. When we go to Disney we're not looking to be at the parks from 8 am till 11 pm each night. We want some downtime too. Taking some quiet time in the lounge with the added amenities is worth it. The late night dessert is the BEST part!! The staff is wonderful. I had a small issue with housekeeping, as turn down service/twice daily housekeeping is included, however they rarely came to our room for the pm service. I assume its bc we would often come back to our room in the late afternoon, but I figured by the 2nd or 3rd day they'd get a handle on this and just come back after we'd left. That was annoying, but if thats the only flaw I can find its fine. I would pay extra for a lagoon view room here. We loved sitting outside on our porch while our daughter slept. We had a pool/garden view which was fine. However, I'd pay the bit extra for a water view. The restaurants here are great too. We still dream about Beaches and Cream, the 50s style soda shoppe restaurant at the Yacht Club next door. And the Cape May cafe's character breakfast was great too. Very fresh, and much less crowded than the big hotel character breakfasts. The greatest thing about this hotel has got to be the location though. We could hear Illuminations, Epcots fireworks show each night from our patio. If we walked over to the Boardwalk side of the lagoon, we could see it. That was such a cool feature of that area. We loved going to the pool during the day here, and walking into the back of Epcots world showcase from our hotel! The pool at this hotel is phenomenal. You have a huge sandbottom area, and a regular pool too with tons of water slides. There are just too many amenities of the hotel to list them all. Basically its down to location.

Our room was large and clean with a full balcony. Disney has recently reclassified the room rates by view. We had paid 9 dollars per day extra for a garden view but it was not worth it as this view consisted of scraggly tree tops 5 feet from the balcony that obscured all views. It was really unfortunate that Disney charged extra for this ugly \"view\". Many of the trees around the property in the front and sides of the hotel could have used some major sprucing up as they were long past their prime and detracted from the beauty and enjoyment of the property. Housekeeping was excellent! We had many requests which were honored promptly and completely. A good tip is to call housekeeping and let them know when you will be out of the room and request that it be made up during your absence. The hotel restaurant staff was helpful and they often went above and beyond their duty to assist you. The life guards at the pool were especially attentive and the recreation staff did a great job with the games at the pool. Basically with the exception of the front desk staff and Bell services, every staff member here was professional and went all out to assist you. We had trouble with the front desk staff when the staff member processing our check in was reluctant to assist us in the way that we needed. All he really needed to do was locate some packages that had been delivered for us and he basically blew us off with out offering to find some one who could assist us. Bell Services was an absolute mess coordinating deliveries that needed to be gathered and sent to our room. We had to explain over and over again what needed to be done as an employee would show up with only 1 package at a time. After promising to return with the rest of the items, a new staff member would appear with 1 thing and we would have to explain all over again. This was very chaotic and contributed greatly to our check in stress. The Hotel facilities were well maintained and transportation was prompt. We never experienced overcrowding on the buses. The down side to transportation at this hotel was the Friendship boats that transport guests to Hollywood Studios.

The greeters were very friendly and one gentleman even got out the pin trading books from behind the concierge desk to help my son find a specific pin he was looking for to complete his Orange Bird series. The location of the hotel is great. Short walk into Epcot. We ended up spending the most time in Epcot because it was so close and the kids liked it best. Longer walk over to Hollywood Studios, approx 25 minutes with two young kids ages 4 and 7. Only tried that walk the first time we went to Hollywood, the second time we took the boat because the walk was just too long for the kids. Buses to the other parks were pretty good. Most times we were lucky and there was a bus just pulling up as we walked up to the bus stop. Only had a couple of times that we had maybe a 15 minute wait. Never had to wait long at all to get buses back to the hotel from the parks either. We did the character breakfast at Cape May one day. It was probably our least favorite of all the character breakfasts we had over the week (which were 6 in total!). Not bad, food was just average and service was painfully slow. The only times we saw our waitress were when we were first seated and when she brought our check. It took her close to 20 minutes to even come back with our card. We had to flag down another waitress to find out what the deal was. Final verdict, you can see the characters that Cape May offers elsewhere and have better food. Beaches and Cream ice cream was good, only did the counter service window here. Tried to get a table for lunch one day without reservations, and it was at least a 30 minute wait outside in the heat (even though I was sick and close to fainting, the hostess would not allow us to wait inside in the doorway) so we decided to skip it. The Marketplace has some good turkey sandwiches available for a quick bite. Pool area is really cool and was a deciding factor for my kids in choosing this hotel. Sadly, we only had time on one afternoon to actually swim. It was crowded, but there were still plenty of open loungers. They play pool games with the kids for prizes and have silly dances and volleyball. Lots of fun for everyone.

I have read a lot of reviews where people aren't complaining about the lack of counter service and snack options at the hotel... with the location being between Epcot, Hollywood Studios and the Boardwalk, my point is there is a ton of options, I always feel that there is always a lot of options within a 5 minute walk... DBC rooms have ample space and you will feel like you are not right on top of each other, rooms are brightly clolored and themed, mousekeeping is great, and if you need something just ask. The pool is second to none, with a section that has its own current (lazy river style) a large section with a sand bottom and another quiet pool as well... The dining options are great, Cape May Cafe has an excellent character breakfast or a new england clam bake for dinner. Hurricanes serves good burgers and nice cold drinks, Beaches and cream has some long lines if you stop by at noon or after 6pm but the burgers and ice cream will help you forget your wait. A quick walk to the Yacht Club will give you more dining options as well... all above average. On top of all this, its really all about location location location, I have never had to wait more than 10-15 minutes for a bus to DMK or DAK, a quick 5 minute walk to Epcots world showcase from the beach club is about the same walk to the Yacktsman steakhouse... boats for hollywood studios come about every 10-15 minutes if not quicker with a couple quick stops for about a 15 minute trip. The market place is pretty small considering all of the surrounding option you have by staying here, but they do have some sandwiches and breakfast options, as well as soft drinks and water, if you are looking to not use your quick service dining plan options on these things... there are several grocery options that deliver to the beach club and other disney resorts... and if you find the right ones they also deliver beer and wine, very good cost savings compared to paying resort prices.

This was our first WDW vacation, and we would definitely stay at this resort again. The lobby and grounds of the hotel are very nice and really meet the deluxe standards. Our king-bed room was nice enough (4573), far from the main elevators but a very close walk to smaller elevator on the side of the building nearest epcot. We had a view of the garden area and also the beach and boardwalk in the distance. The room was clean enough--I felt comfortable walking barefoot on the carpet which is saying a lot. There did seem to be a difference in housekeepers during our stay, and it showed as our room started to get more and more clean mid-week. There is a nice little fridge and mini coffee maker which we used daily. We ordered groceries from an outside company to be delivered before we arrived, and we were very glad we did. We ate breakfast in our room almost every day and saved a lot of money and enjoyed the convenience. The bus service to MK and AK was easy, prompt and covenient. Water taxi service to HS was nice, as we found the walk to be quite a distance, especially in the heat. Walking to HS is much shorter if staying on the opposite side of Crescent Lake, such as at Boardwalk or Swan and Dolphin. However, walk to Epcot from Beach Club was literally 5 minutes, if that. It was so nice being that near to Epcot's World Showcase. We almost felt like we were staying right at Epcot. Most of the staff were very nice and helpful, from the Bell staff to the front desk staff to people working at the pool and in the restaurants. The staff in the Marketplace were another story, especially those at the food counter who were extremely rude and even told us they had run out of food one night when we attempted to order around 10:30 pm (sign clearly reads that they serve food until 11 pm). Other than that, we found the employees were all up to the Disney standard. The pool area is very nice and there is a lot to do in the pool complex. There are also smaller pools which are much quieter. The pool just outside our wing almost never had anyone in it. There was laundry room just off of the pool also, so one day we were able to do laundry and swim while we waited for it! The location of this hotel is the very best thing about it. Aside from having access to all the dining of the Yacht and Beach Club Resorts, you have access to the Boardwalk area, swan and Dolphin and can walk right into Epcot for lunch or dinner. The Boardwalk area is really neat with shops, stands and benches to relax on. On the Beach Club side of the lake, there are movies on the beach every night. There are also surrey bikes as well as small boats available to rent. Really the only complaint we have, besides the rudeness of the staff at the Marketplace, is that housekeeping was a little loud just outside our room. It seems 4573 is just across from a housekeeping headquarters or storage room, as well as a very loud a.c. unit, so it was almost never quiet in our room during the day. Each morning around 7 am, housekeeping began slamming doors and hollering right outside our door. This wasn't a major problem for us, because we were up early every day anyway, but don't stay in this room or on this hall if you expect to sleep in or nap in your room. I'm sure there are quieter areas, and we never complained to anyone, or I'm sure we would have been moved to a different room or housekeeping would have tried to be quieter. We will definitely stay here again. It was so worth paying the extra for a deluxe resort to stay here, particularly in this location and for the level of service and amenities we received. A word of caution: Beware the non-Disney pizza delivery companies who put fliers under your door! They are rude and likely criminals! They harrassed us in our room after we attempted to place an order, then cancelled after the woman who was taking the order rudely hung up the telephone on us. They repeatedly called our phone and even arrived to the hotel and tried to get the front desk staff to allow them to come up to our room. Thankfully, the front desk staff was very courteous and sent them away. We were actually scared of them, because of the very rude and threatening tone of one of their employees over the telephone. I spent a day looking over my shoulder every time we were in our hallway, because they did know our room number. I have heard other bad things about them as well, including that the food is disgusting. Just order room service pizza from the hotel.

Had one incident of \"unscheduled maintenance\"- everyone out of the pool and it took an hour before we could go back in...after being told '20 minutes' in the beginning but a clean pool is desirable so it is what it is.

The staff at the Market Place store where very friendly and accommodating. They would always greet you right away and offer to refill our refillable mugs for us.

I planned this trip for about 9 months and labored over which hotel we would stay at for our first on-property Disney visit. I had been to Disney 5 other times but have stayed off site.Our choices were a bit narrowed because we are a family of 5 and there are not as many options for families of 5 as their are for smaller parties. We choose the Beach Club for it's seaside decor and proximity to EPCOT. We have 3 kids 10, 7, 4. We debated about this location or a Magic Kingdom hotel because of the kids. After being there, we decided that we made the right choice because of all the dining options in EPCOT. It was a brief walk to EPCOT. It was also a short boat ride to DHS. The Boardwalk was either in walking or boat distance. This was also a nice area to spend some time. We did stay Club Level so my review is based on this experience. We found check in a breeze - did not do online but we were able to check in upstairs on the club level. We would stay club level again. Our room was spacious for 5 with a large day bed that was the size of a single bed. We had a dormer balcony that had ample room for two chairs. The beds were sooooo comfortable - the sheets, the mattress made settling in after a long park day very comforting. Ample clothes storage. We had no noise from the hall or the adjacent rooms. The room was very clean! Mousekeeping was great, towel animals daily -remember to tip them for their efforts. The resort had a happy atmosphere and all of the CMs were very friendly and helpful. The resort was clean and welcoming. It has a wonderful smell as you walk through the entry doors. The pool was outstanding. We just wish we would have spend more time there. It has a great water slide that the kids loved.The lifeguards were very nice and they even got in the pool with kids at the end of the shift. The kids thought that was really cool. We only ate at Hurricane Hannah's. Great burgers -I hear they are the same as Beaches and Cream. We unfortunately did not try Beaches and Cream. We had breakfast and things in the club lounge, which were all great. The Marketplace did have numerous options even though it is not truly a quick service place. Our 2 boys, 10 and 4, did the Albatross pirate cruise that leaves from the boat dock. They had a blast - something I would recommend. It's tought balancing park time and resort time. I left wishing we would have spent more time at the resort.For our first on property stay, it was great and I can't image staying anywhere else and I am looking forward to returning again.

After hearing for years about the fabulous customer service Disney is known for, I was expecting to be wowed during my stay. However, I was far from wowed. Upon check-in, I was told that there were no clean rooms ready. However, a group checking in next to me was immediately given access to their three rooms. When I questioned this, the woman behind the counter (who had very bad English) couldn't give me an answer as to why the other guests could access their rooms and I could not. The woman told me I would need to speak with her supervisor. The supervisor told me that if I didn't mind having a room with a garden view rather than a lake view, I could access my room right away. I said that was fine, and was given a room on the first floor, right off the lobby area. When I opened the door to my room, the door stood open for a solid 20 seconds before automatically closing on its own - a handicapped room. Every time I opened the door to leave the room, I had to stand there for 20 seconds and make sure that it did in fact close before I left. My shower was made for roll-in wheelchairs and water leaked everywhere each time I used it. Coincidentally, there were a group of workers with ladders and such performing maintenance on the building right outside of my patio. Everytime I went out on the patio, they all gave me dirty looks as if I was not supposed to be outside near where they working. My patio door had an issue with the lock. I could NOT get the lock to work. I called the front desk twice about this issue, and was told maintenance would come to fix the lock for me. They never came. I actually ended up shoving a chair under the handle while I slept at night because I felt very unsafe (being that I was on ground level and any could just walk right in to my room, including the mass of workers right outside). I could not help but think that the front desk had intentionally given me a bad room because they were not happy that I didn't want to wait for a room to be prepared when checking in. I was not overly impressed by the pool. Filled with screaming children throwing balls and water toys around. And the sand bottom actually seemed dirty. There were a few waiters walking by who were apparently there to serve drinks to guests laying poolside. However, they never made the initiative to approach anyone. People would have to try repeatedly to flag them down in order to get a drink. The few good things about the resort were the pretty view of the boardwalk; the well-equipped fitness center; and the convenience store located right off the lobby. I would never stay here again and would certainly not recommend it to others.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for Adult Couples\u201d", "Author": "JCBraz", "ReviewID": "UR108826557", "Content": "My wife and I (early 30\u2019s) stayed at Beach Club in early May to celebrate our first anniversary. At first, we were considering booking at Wilderness Lodge or Animal Kingdom, but at the suggestion of our super travel agent, Lynda Hower at Dream Makers Vacation Services, we decided on Beach Club. We were certainly that glad that we did. For a couple in their early 30\u2019s with no kids, Beach Club\u2019s atmosphere is perfect: Very soft colors, beachy, with a hint of sophistication. Many have raved about the pool. I have to agree. Not only does it capture the mellow theme that people like myself enjoy, but they don\u2019t play non-stop kid music, instead focusing on an array of tropically themed music for adults. The area around Hurricane Hannah\u2019s made us feel that we were somewhere other than Disney, which wasn\u2019t a bad thing after long days dodging motor scooters and rampaging kids in the parks. The water slide could have been in a water park. The only downside to the slide was having to cross the pathway over to the slide entrance. This could be a problem if a motor scooter is nearby. The view at night is great, especially with the Boardwalk all lit up. Again, another adult like bonus to the resort. Also, since we enjoy our cocktails, the short walk to Epcot is fantastic. You are literally five minutes away, two minutes if you zoom by on a motor scooter, which seem to plague Disney now. Being able to walk over to the Rose & Crown to enjoy a pint is great. It also helps to walk off the unwanted calories from drinking. The walk to Hollywood Studios is a little longer, and something that should be considered in the summer time heat. Buy the resort mugs. It is worth it in the end. The Ale and Compass at the attached Yacht Club (honestly, it feels like the same hotel) is a cool place with nice d\u00e9cor for time out of the sun. The gym is perfect for a vacation. Although they don\u2019t have the heavier weights, there is enough to get the job done before venturing out for the day.

We used Tripadvisor as well as other resources to research the best Disney Hotel for us and fnally decided on the Beach Club because of it's consistently good reviews and it's proximity to Epcot (our favourite park). It's fair to say therefore that our expectations were high but from the moment we turned into the driveway we were thrilled with this hotel and it exceeded our expectations in every way. The Beach Club has a wonderful ambience that is hard to describe but it striked the perfect balance of casual and elegant. From the moment you go through the gate it's a beautiful place to be. The staff, without exception, were friendly, happy, courteous and always on hand to help and anticipate your evey need. We were greeted by name at the front entrance when we pulled up, whisked to the check in and given lots of information in prepraration for our holiday. Our 3 year old daughter was given her own activity pack to keep her amused whilst we checked in and was always treated like an important person in her own right. I would say that the Beach Club is especially excellent for families with children but wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone at all looking for a first class service and hotel in Disneyworld. The lobby of this place is just beautiful - we visited many other Disney hotels for meals whilst there and no others even came close except perhaps for the Yacht Club next door but even that doesn't have the same fun, friendly feel as the Beach Club. The Grand Floridian had wow factor but lacked the atmosphere and ambience of the Beach Club. The room (a standard) was much larger than I expected - certainly larger than other Disney hotel rooms. The beds had duvets as well as blanket and sheets so you could choose your preference - in our case duvets. They were very comfortable with two pillows each instead of the usual one and nice touches like dimmable lamps and plenty of bedside storage. The bathroom, which we were expecting to be very small from the reviews was actually perfectly lovely with a huge vanity area which more than made up for the compact bath and toilet area. The room decor itself is just lovely, light and airy with a pleasing colour scheme and plenty of storage (there was a separate 4 drawer dresser in addition to the wardrobe and a multi-drawered unit that the TV sits on). It really felt like care had been taken to make the room as comfortable as possible. Mousekeeping were superb and always managed to do their thing whilst we were out, no matter what time of day we happened to leave or come back - it's like some kind of magic! Whenever we passed them in the hallway we were always greeted with a smile and a friendly hello. The Cape May Cafe was fantastic - Minnie, Donald and Goofy were there the morning we had breakfast there. We were worried we wouldn't be able to eat there as we hadn't been able to book a reservation for there online before we went but, to our amazement, we rolled up there at 8.30am on our first morning and were seated within 2 minutes! Be prepared to pay a lot for character dining, it IS expensive but in our opinion it's well worth it as it's always a magical experience. Make sure you buy an autograph book and chunky pen before you go - they sell them in the hotel shop. We probably did a total of around 7 character meals whilst there and Cape May was one of the best. We also ate at the Beaches & Cream Ice Cream Parlour which was lovely - they do burgers and the like there too so it's perfect for a quick snack or lunch. Speaking of the hotel shop, that was fab too, lots of Disney gifts and souveniers obviously but also a great range of hot & cold food, beverages, groceries etc... You could easily have a very nice breakfast from there and take it back to your room to eat. We bought a small carton of Mickey Milk for my daughter there every other day and they always had what we needed. The Beach Club's location really can't be beaten. It really is just a 5 minute walk from the World Showcase entrance of Epcot, it was superb to be able to leave the hotel and a short - very pleasant - walk later be at Epcot, right between England and France. Very handy for early starts, evening meals or just a nice stroll! It's also a few minutes walk from the Boardwalk which is just the other side of the beach and lake outside the back of the hotel. Of an evening the view of the Boardwalk all lit up on the other side of the lake is really lovely. It's also a great route for those runners out there (it's 1 mile around the lake and back but can be extended by diverting around the Swan or Dolphin hotels). Every evening they show a Disney movie on the beach, chairs are lined up or you can take a beach towel and it's a wonderful atmosphere. They also have marshmallows and singalong on the beach every evening too. Stormalong Bay, the Beach & Yacht Club's pool is something else - simply amazing! How do you combine a beach with a pool? Go to the Beach Club and see for yourself! Our little girl LOVED it, she could play in the sand and paddle her feet in the gently sloping pool or play in the shallow small pools that were dotted around. There were always heaps of buckets and spades lying around for the kids to play with so no need to take your own. The area is exclusively for the guests of the Beach & Yacht Clubs so you need to show a valid room key each for admission but then you're given a wristband and as many towels as you need and can come and go as you please. There are loads of loungers and one morning we arrived and the ladies sweeping the sand (yes they sweep the sand!) actually arranged our loungers for us so they were in the shade and asked us if we needed anything, it really was above and beyond great service! We had a rental car for our entire holiday so used the car park daily but there were never any problems finding a space and once you have your keycard you just use that to open the barriers and enter the car park each time. When we booked our holiday we decided we would split our 10 day stay into a week at the Beach Club and 3 days at The Animal Kingdom Lodge. When we checked out of the Beach Club at the end of our first week I was VERY sad to leave it and, in hindsight it was a mistake. I will review the AKL seperately but suffice to say it PALED it comparison to the Beach Club for a whole list of reasons (and that was even in a Savannah View room at Animal Kingdom Lodge) and I would never stay there again. Next time we come to Disneyworld we will definitely choose the Beach Club, nowhere else even comes close! I think I fell a little bit in love with it and I will always remember our first stay in this most perfect of Disney Hotels.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cExcellent ...

Loved this hotel - most especially the location. Great to be able to walk to Epcot (made lots of dinner reservations there - it worked out well) and short boat ride to Hollywood Studios. Need to take a bus to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. To get to Fort Wilderness (if going to the Hoop Dee Doo Revue - highly recommend) - you need to take a bus to Magic Kingdom - then catch a boat from there to the campground. Allow plenty of time for this trip - for the 7:15 show the front desk recommended leaving at 5:30 - and you need the time! (We left later and did arrive a little late!) Bus ride to MK is about 20 minutes, to Animal Kingdom about 15 minutes - not bad and buses come every 15 minutes or so. 5 minute walk to Epcot, 10 minute boat ride to HS. We booked a water view room - not impressed with the view. If garden view available - just get that! Most balconies are just big enough for 2 people to stand on - very small. As mentioned by others, there is outside painting currently going on at the hotel. Cranes around the property, paint scraped off the trim, etc - but it didnt bother us. If we want the hotel to stay beautiful they do need to do maintenance sometimes!!!! The overall condition of the hotel is very nice and the grounds are meticuosly landscaped. But hotel does show signs of age (rusty vent in shower, some 'scraped' walls, things like that) - not perfect. Views over to the Boardwalk are great - beautiful setting. We had dinner at the Animal Kingdom Lodge one night and found the entire hotel to be dark and somewhat depressing. Complete opposite of the Beach Club - it is really beauiful. Only ate in the Marketplace at the hotel (didnt use the other restaurants). Sandwiches and breakfast pastries are Yummy! Great store - offer lots of souveniers, grocery items (for your room), refillable drink mugs (definately worth the $), etc. Pool is best we saw at Disney. Fantastic, large 2 foot deep sandy \"beach\" area for the little ones - our 4 year old daughter loved it. The pirate pool slide is a great ride - even for the grown ups. Our 10 and 7 year olds loved that! Entire pool has a sand bottom - so cool! Plenty of chairs and tables - never had an issue finding a nice spot. Hurricane Hannahs offers beer and drinks and a refill station for those mugs! Waitresses at the pool were great too. Can get a burger or hot dog by the pool. Staff leads games each day (although somewhat cheesy - name that tune, hoola hoop, etc - typical). Lazy river doesnt do much - no current really to push you along, weak. But a nice swim around the pool nonetheless. Food: We had the food plan that included 1 snack , 1 quick serve, and 1 sit dowm meal per day/per person. This is plenty of food. The snack choices are great! (breakfast pastry, candybars, yogurt parfaits, ice cream, fruit, popcorn, soda, water - all included). The quick serve (\"cafeteria style\") restaurants in the parks worked perfectly for lunch each day. Only quick serve we had that we didnt like was in Mexico at Epcot. Dinners - we ate at the Hoop Dee Doo Revue (fun and great food), Via Napoli in Italy (great brick oven pizza - highly recommend), Kona Cafe at the Polynesian (get the teriyaki sirloin - very good), 50's Prime Time Cafe (lots of fun - great waitress), Teppan Edo in Japan (best meal we had!), and Boma at Animal Kingdom Lodge (not very good - do NOT recommend). Also had a Character Breakfast Buffet at Crystal Palace (this was OK - although not impressed. Have had MUCH better breakfast buffets - food was cold, not huge variety) - but kids enjoyed the Winnie the Pooh characters. Shows: DO NOT MISS FANTASMIC!! Saw it our 1st night - was the best show we saw entire trip. Go early - it is a mob scene. We liked Nemo better than Lion King at Animal Kingdom. Beauty and Beast was great at HS and 'Lights, Motors, Action' much better than 'Indiana Jones' (we found Indiana Jones to be boring). Go to the parks early and hit the BIG rides 1st (Rock and Roller Coaster, Expedition Everest, Kilimanjaro Safari, Soarin, Test Track, Space Mountain, Tower of Terror, etc - we barely waited in line). Did need a fast pass for Toy Story Mania - cute ride/game. Kids liked it! Electric Light Parade was fantastic - got a front row seat and the floats and characters come so close! 'Wishes' Fireworks - on Main St. behind castle - spectacular(look for Tinkerbell) ! Not as impressed with Illuminations - not many lasers anymore - mostly fireworks (Wishes is better!) If your kids want pictures with Characters check the times guide when you get to each park for times/locations and go early. The lines can be very long and they will close them off if there are alot of people. We were the last people in line before they closed the Tinkerbell line- and we had to wait 1 and 1/2 hours for pictures with Tink. (Our daughter was thrilled - but waiting in 90 degree weather, not much fun). Pictures with the Princesses in MK was great - indoors in AC, and you got pics with Belle, Princess Aurora, and Cinderella all in one line! We had a fantasticly exhausting vacation. Get ready to walk (alot), sweat, and fight the crowds - but SOOOO much fun! We crammed in as much as we could in one week and are so glad we did.

It's an absolutely beautiful resort but the \"service\" we received from the front desk staff and especially the concierge was so poor that we just can't give it any better than an average rating. THE PROS: Gorgeous property located within a 5 minute walk to Epcot and a quick boat ride to Hollywood Studios. The bus service to MK, AK and DD is your typical overcrowded, slow ride, but just deal with it. You're on vacation! The grounds are beautifully landscaped and the 3 acre pool is breathtaking. Could have spent an entire day at the pool alone! The beach along the lake is well kept and it was great to just sit and \"people watch\" at night or stroll over to the Boardwalk which is also just a 5 minute walk. Plenty of activities close by for everyone. Disney movies were shown on the beach each night - great resort for families with children or for adult couples. Something to please everybody. The attached Yacht Club is also beautiful and we ate breakfast at the Captain's Grill most mornings. Nice break from the happy chaos over at the Cape May Cafe if you're looking for a quiet meal. BTW - The Cape May is a lot of fun and the characters do a great job of keeping the kids entertained! Hurricane Hannah's Grill (located at the pool) is a nice spot for a snack, lunch or adult beverage - try the Pina Co-LAVA - yummy! You can also bring your resort mug there for unlimited soft drink refills. The hotel is just stunning and is worth the extra $$ just for the pool and great location alone! THE CONS: Booked this vacation over 6 months ago and there was never any mention about the renovations going on with the exterior of the hotel. There were a multitude of giant lift-trucks parked all over the grounds, pick-up trucks parked in walkways, giant pressure-washing trailers parked on the lawns, scaffolding and so many workers in orange vests and hard hats milling around that it was difficult to get a decent picture of the hotel. I have to say they were all very friendly, though! It appears they are repainting, re-siding and renovating the trim/molding. We're all for maintaining a property but we would've appreciated the option of choosing different dates to avoid this mess. Constant sounds of jack-jammering, scraping, hammering and pressure washing made for a much less relaxing vacation than what we expected and paid for. Didn't bother complaining about it to the front desk, though, as they seemed to be seriously irritated enough just being there. Which brings up the just average rating for this hotel. Check-In at the Beach Club was not a pleasant experience. There was no \"Welcome Home\" greeting upon entering the hotel. Instead, we were \"greeted\" by an expressionless woman who asked \"You are?\" When we gave our last name, she simply pointed to a long line and asked us to wait in it. After about 15 minutes, we were checked in by a very bored looking woman and sent on our way. The room was just a very bland, standard room with no real style to speak of. Very small closet with only 6 hangers and 2 tiny drawers to store our clothing. The room also had a seriously funky smell that never really disipated - can't even describe the smell. Oh well, we weren't spending that much time in the room so what the heck, right? We dealt with the broken lamp, the lack of storage space, the broken sink and bathtub faucets, the funky smell...you get the picture. Not what you would expect for almost $400 per night. We had a pleasant 5 days though up until the night before check-out. Due to a family situation at home, we wanted to check for an earlier flight home the next day. I stopped at the concierge desk to see if there was a PC on site that I could use. The concierge, a really grumpy man, looked up at me over his glasses and asked if it was for business or personal use. ??? As I tried to explain that it was to check on a flight change, he interrupted me and told me I could use a computer in the convention/conference center next door but not until tomorrow morning at 7am. I was so miffed by his rude attitude that I didn't even think to ask him to check the airline schedule for me. If he was a true professional, he would have offered his assistance without being asked. To top it off, he didn't bothering mentioning there's a charge for internet access at the conference center and a $1.00 per page charge if you want to print anything. I chose to call the airline myself and change the flights and then have the morning-shift concierge print our boarding passes. We didn't use the baggage service upon check out due to the change in flight plans. No offers for assistance though as we wheeled our large suitcases out. The poor service at check in (and especially the concierge) and the unexpected construction noise was enough to leave a bad taste in our mouths but the resort itself is so beautiful that we can't say we wouldn't recommend it to our friends and family.

The transportation provided by Disney, to each park was super convenient - we used it very frequently. On longer park days, we went back to the resort for our 2-year old's nap and cooled off in the pools. Which brings me to that topic...absolutely amazing pool area for the entire family. The sand-bottom pool areas were really neat. We also used the smaller pool in a different area of the resort for late-evening swims (the water was nice and warm...if you prefer that).

This hotel is within walking distance to EPCOT but the rest of the parks are reached via the Disney buses that pull up in front of the hotel. Also, right across the lake is the Disney Boardwalk area with more choices of restaurants. Since we are hockey fans and were there during the playoffs, we spent some time at the ESPN restaurant/bar.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fuquay Varina, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cHas GREAT potential, but...\u201d", "Author": "twilkins80", "ReviewID": "UR103826039", "Content": "The hotel, of course, is beautiful. The grounds are typical Disney, gorgeous flowers and trees everywhere. The pool feels tropical... my husband and I thought the sand bottom and the \"miniature beaches\" were a really cool ideas for the kids. We saw lots of kids building sand castles while running back and forth to the water. The \"beach\" and walkway have a 1920-ish feel with the boardwalk in the distance and the ambiance music softly playing. The hotel also had a few really cool things, movies at night on the lawn, a bonfire roasting marshmallows, and really great access to Epcot and H.S! The walk to Epcot was only about 5 minutes. The service overall was very helpful. The front desk, concierge and all the servers during our two catered company meals were all helpful, cheerful and made me feel like they actually enjoyed working there and helping us. The food for both of the meals was excellent! Those are the perks. ... Every day that we were there they were doing serious renovating. They had big tractors and cranes working all over the grounds. There was a constant jack hammering sound, a loud sander, and workers all over painting. It really kinda ruins the ambiance of sitting on the back deck with an ocean view while a big tractor beeps and raises it's crane in front of you... or when you are trying to relax in your room with your door open and all you can hear is a jack hammer. I would've been seriously irritated if I saved all year to go on a \"relaxing\" Disney vacation just to deal with the construction sites and sounds. If we ever do save and decide to go back I will make sure there is no renovating going on. I would also request a room on the end farthest away from the main pool. There are a lot of pool activities, which is cool if you are doing the activities, not cool if you are hanging out in your room. Loud music, loud voices on a megaphone, and loud kids, once again, take away from a \"relaxing\" trip. I didn't mind too much, because when you go to Disney you don't really hang out in your room all day, but as a Mom and being around kid craziness all day, my idea of a calmer trip is one that doesn't sound like there is a school playground right outside your window. I also considered the Yacht Club instead of the Beach Club next trip.. it was further away from the pool. Also, the last day my hubby and me wanted to go to Sea World. But being a Disney resort, they only do transportation to Disney parks. The concierge was very helpful about helping us find the most economical way to get to Sea World, (take the bus to Downtown Disney, then grab a taxi from there to Sea World.) Taxi fare is something to plan for if you aren't driving and plan on seeing other sites. There really are so many positives, but the noise and renovation were a big downer. If you go when the renovation is over, it would be GREAT!", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New England", "Title": "\u201cRude Concierge\u201d", "Author": "NewEnglandFoodietoo", "ReviewID": "UR103194013", "Content": "Have stayed here many times over the years.

He was very apologetic and gave us a great tour of the floor and our room. The club level seemed a bit estravegant and I had a bit of buyers remorse after booking our reservation. I was very glad in the end that I didn't change anything. Every morning we were in the lounge for a deliscious breakfast before hitting the parks. There were a variety of pastries, bagels, cereals, beverages and hard boiled eggs. The lounge was staffed by at least 3-4 cast members that bussed tables efficiently and kept the food stocked. The lounge wasn't very large and there were mornings when families struggled to find a place to sit, but the cast members did provide trays to bring food back to the rooms. In the afternoon there were snacks such as, pretzels, sweedish fish, nuts and cookies available. My favorate time was between 5 and 7 when we would come back from the parks for a break to find a varity of hot and cold snacks and beverages available. The offerings ranged from cheese and crackers and olives to scewered teriaki chicken and scallops wrapped in bacon. Sodas were available all day, but in the afternoon there was also beer and wine. Late in the evening tasty deserts waited for us as we returned from the park. We found that we only needed one meal outside of the food made available in the club level lounge.

There are places that showed a little wear in the hotel, but it appeared that repairs were being made. The room was very large for a family of four, but I was very disappointed with the trundle bed.

Ok folks this is the truth from a normal person like yourself and not some lady complaining Mickey Mouse hugged the kid at the next table but not her kid..lol. Beach Club was clean and elegant and the staff were friendly(not overly friendly but perfectly proffesional and nice). The resort is a quiet place at a lot of times and this is saying something because spring break was pretty crowded this year. The location is unbeatable as you can walk to EPCOT and the Boardwalk. Storm-a-long Bay pool as better than advertised , kids and i had a blast and never felt cramped. The room was spacious compared to other Disney resorts and it was spotless. The beds were extremely comfortable(you melt away in those BC beds)..Now i will tell you about some snags we had. Got there at 9 am and the resort gave us a choice of taking a room that was ready or waiting for a better location. We went to the ready room and it was a mile away from the lobby and the view was a rooftop. We decided that we would grin and bear it and take the room. We were all tired and the view wasn't that important to us. The resort knew we had 5 people but the room had no pull out chair for a 5th sleeper. They sent a roll away up for us. Another head scratcher was that housekeeping only left 4 towels a day for a room with 5 people??? We notified the desk and the mousekeeper about this the first day but still got the same thing. We called for a DVD player that was supposed to be in the room at 8 am..................they brought it up at (get this) 11 pm??. So the truth is the Beach Club service may need a little attention. The bell desk guys were great though and the pool staff were the best. This is a beautiful resort and it is very well lit. We enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to you.........

We could not get out anywhere in the Caribbean so the next best thing was Disney Beach Club Resort. We have been to Disney around 7 times\u2026. 5 of which we stayed in the Disney area at the Contemporary three times, Polynesian once, Port Orleans once and this time the Disney Beach Club. We were very pleased and surprised being last minute to book at how nice and accommodating the Beach Club was and we actually liked the location better then the Contemporary and Polynesian. The Beach Club was fast to check us in and set us up with our passes and off to the room where our bellman Mike informed us of all the short cuts and must knows about the Beach Club. The staff was very accommodating, our room was always clean with new towels every day and the beds were comfortable. I actually loved the size of the room and the separate vanity area to get ready in the morning. It had a little refrigerator and nice drawer space so we were very happy. We had a ground floor room so it was so easy just going out the door to a path that led right to Epcot and the Boardwalk area so it was a convenient location for us. I can\u2019t believe how easy it was to walk right into Epcot which was nice on New Year\u2019s Eve. I also found the pool area to be the best in the Disney area. They have a quiet pool for the Beach Club with hot tub and then a huge share pool that both the Yacht Club and Beach Club share which is awesome. It has huge slides and a ship wreck boat and lots of nice little areas and coves. You can have lunch right by it and drinks as well. The Beach Club also had their own little beach area with lots of lounge chairs to give you that beach feeling. We did all the parks which I found to be very crowded, but what do you expect on a holiday week, right? In the Magic Kingdom we only had the opportunity to do 4 rides in 6 hours and on our Hollywood Studios Day we actually only did 2 rides in 5 hours. It was fine for us since we have been to Disney numerous times but I would be upset if it was my first time. We were able to do what we wanted to do and then just take our time and enjoy the parks. On New Year\u2019s Day we ventured over to Universal and found that park to be less crowded which was a strategy of mine thinking everyone had a late night the night before. We were able to walk right into the Harry Potter Village and do the rides all within 10 minutes. We heard that days before they had to have crowd control just to get into Harry Potter and special tickets were given out telling you a time in which you can enter. We lucked out on this. We were a bit upset about how this park is run. They do not seem to have as many employees as Disney to help guide you. My kids did the Hulk ride at Island of Adventure and when they were getting into their cart to ride they were told they had to put their backpack on the side. There were other backpacks sitting there. When they got off the ride the backpack was gone. They asked for the attendant to call security and the reply was \u201cThere is nothing security can do for you.\u201d We went to a nearby concession stand and told them and they were quick to call security for us. It took approximately 30 minutes for a security officer to show up and he did not seem that concerned just took us to lost and found to report it. So\u2026..my son\u2019s girlfriend lost her ID, Disney Card, checkbook, bank card, both their cell phones and a camera and we spent the rest of the day checking lost and found and reporting things stolen. This ruined our day and not much concern at all from the park which I know would never have happened at a Disney Park. So, we decided to do the one ride at the Universal side of the park the boys wanted to do. The new rollercoaster that plays music as you ride. After a 2 1/12 hour wait for the ride (you cannot fast pass it) the ride broke down and my guys never got to ride it. No special pass tickets for those who waited that long\u2026nothing. So back to the resort for us. When we arrived at the Beach Club and reported what happened they were very concerned. They took my son and girlfriend in a back room and showed them how to fill out a report for the police which will get her on the plane to come home. They got her a new safe key within no time and at no charge (it said if you lose your safe key there is a 30.00 charge) and cancelled and replaced her Disney Card to enter parks which was also a charge card within the Disney area. I can\u2019t say enough how wonderful they were at the Disney Beach Club Resort. I would highly recommend the Disney Beach Club to anyone. I do want to add that we did the Disney Magical Express on this trip which I really liked. The best part was when leaving we checked our bags at the resort and never saw them again until we got home. We were able to get our boarding passes and leave our bags right at the resort and when we got to the airport we headed right through security. This was a wonderful experience and I would recommend taking it but did know that when arriving at Disney to bring your bags on the bus with you because it could take up to 3 hours to arrive in your room. If you don\u2019t care because you are going right to the park then go for it but if you arrive later that day and want to unpack and relax until dinner\u2026..don\u2019t do it.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA wonderful week\u201d", "Author": "Cruella10861", "ReviewID": "UR90940300", "Content": "This was my first stay at The Beach Club, although I have stayed at other Epcot resorts.

However, I do recommend that if you MUST eat at a partcular venue you book as soon as you make your hotel reservation.It was difficult to get same day bookings or walk ins. The parks were busier than in previous years at this time of year (my favourite for visiting) but still not overcrowded. Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party was again well organised. Housekeeping at the hotel was second to none. Our maid left us a new animal (made from towels every day). A nice touch. We chatted with the lady (Jacqueline) and she was a delight. Service at Cape May Cafe was also superb. My husband was unable to find asparagus on the buffet and, within 2 minutes of mentioning this to our server,tere was a plate of steaming hot asparagus, just for him.She also took photographs of us with the characters without being asked.

I will start by saying that for $340 a night and Disney, my expectations were high. It was a great trip, and a good stay, but there are definate pros and cons. First off, Beach Club is lovely in appearance. Everything was decorated for Christmas and couldn't have been prettier. The gingerbread carousel in the lobby is something to see! Magical express was flawless-no issues there. Our bags arrived just over an hour after we checked in. We did online check in, which was a very good thing. The front desk experience was so-so, with the clerk having a VERY strong accent (hubs couldn't understand what he was saying at all). Service was fine, but certainly not stellar. We got lucky in that our room was ready when we checked in at 1100, so we went right there. Bell services was very helpful and quick to respond. The room was spacious for our familiy of 5 (especially liked the day bed), the beds were comfy, and the sink area was nice. The toilet/shower area was TINY, though and the water pressure in the showers was ridiculously poor. Be advised, the walls are paper thin and sound pours under the doors from anyone passing by at any hour. Mousekeeping was OK, but a little hit or miss. I really would have expected better with a hotel this expensive. One small complaint I have is the overwhelming odor of stinky seafood from the Cape May buffett that permeates the floors above. It seems to stay in the hallways, but its kind of gross. The pool area was awesome, but it was too cold for us to experience it this trip. Location was fantastic. Being that close to Epcot was great, as it is one of our favorite parks. If you have the Dining plan, it expands your eating options vastly, as the food in all the other parks is terrible and counter service is essentially non-existant within the hotel. The Marketplace is an OK option for a quick snack or small breakfest, but got a little old after a few days. It is also busy busy in the am. We did eat over at Yacht Club at the Yachtsman Steakhouse (me and hubby-no kids), which I would highly recommend. Quite expensive, though. Knowing that this is Disney and highway robbery is par for the course, the Beach Club is a good place to stay, but not a good value AT ALL.

The place was beautiful, and had everything anyone could possibly want--a beautiful lobby, great sitting areas (some quiet and blissfuly child-free), a giant pool complex, a smaller pool and jacuzzi deemed 'quiet' where no children ventured (which is GREAT in a place like Disney) and what must be the best location of all of the resorts. I've never really wanted to go to Disney--I was afraid of lots of screaming children--but this place made me want to return. There is a man in the lobby who, from what I could tell, is employed solely to tell people to 'have a magical day'. How great is that? As was mentioned in several reviews, the bus service to the parks is annoying--I had to wait almost 45 minutes for a bus from the magic kingdom, and it does stop multiple times--but I imagine this is true for all resorts. In the future, I'd rent a car. But as annoying as the shuttles are, you only need them for two of the four parks--you can walk to Hollywood Stuidos, and Epcot is LITERALLY right next door. We had a first floor room with a patio, and could walk directly out of our room onto a path that led to Epcot that was maybe 200 yards away--it literally took 3 minutes to walk there. I hope that some day I can return. An important note: I stayed at the Beach Club this past week for a convention. Because of this, I got the convention rate, which is less than the normal rate--and half of THAT was paid for by my husband's work (as he was also going to the convention)--we paid for 'my half'.

They have two \"quiet\" pools (one at end of Beach Club's property--another at end of Yacht Club's) that are open 24 hrs and have hot tubs. The large recreation pool was open from 10am-10pm and had plenty of lifeguards on duty. One of the main features was a huge pirate ship that contained a water slide that emptied across the beach path and into the pool. Very cool! The property set up is very convenient...with the Yacht and Beach Clubs basically sharing all the amenities, you get twice the restaurant choices, etc. There is an arcade/ice cream shop in the middle that we enjoyed at night. If you like they have show family movies on the \"beach\" every night and you can see the fireworks from Epcot. We received a first floor suite with separate bedroom and sitting area and a small, oustide sitting area/patio Rooms were extremely clean, bedding and mattresses VERY comfy--received turn down service with chocolates every night. I initially was concerned with us being on the first floor about noise, but we had no issues at all. We visit Disney every year anywhere from once to three times. I have not stayed in every resort as of yet, but many of them. My long running favorite is still Animal Kingdom Lodge, but this resort ran a VERY close 2nd.! The location very convenient, especially if you are visiting Epcot (5 min walk to rear gate). We did hotel buffet at night (Cape May Cafe) which was the seafood dinner. I found it to be just average...however, be aware that this seemed to be consistent throughout Disney. The quality has suffered from what I've come to experience in past years, and I'm not sure how much of it is due to just plain ole cutting back--or because Disney is giving away their dining plan free to everyone that books resort packages!

I may take the time to mention something like that IF the door DIDN\u2019T close. Geesh people!! If your household income isn\u2019t in the seven figures, this resort is AWESOME, stop reading and go book your trip! We are a family of three; two adults (in our early 40\u2019s) and a seven year old. We stayed at the Beach Club Resort Oct 11 \u2013 18; standard room (room # 3583). We overlooked a courtyard with a sand volleyball court. Check-in: We took advantage of the online check in, and arrived at 9:30am on the 11th. The entire check-in process at the hotel took approximately one minute; and much to my surprise, we were told that our room was ready. Room #3583: Nice room, d\u00e9cor was beach themed (big surprise, huh?). Two queen sized beds and a day bed. Small fridge, flat screen TV, plenty of storage for clothes, two sinks and a small balcony that 2 people can stand on and overlook the courtyard. The beds were incredibly comfortable, as were the sheets (no idea of thread count) and the comforter. I cannot speak to the \u201cnoise\u201d from the hallway that other people have mentioned, as we travel with a sound therapy machine (we use \u201cwaterfall\u201d), so we don\u2019t hear anything. Stormalong Bay (pool): Awesome. Incredible. Outstanding. Unbelievable. Stunning. Not to build it up too much, but it is pretty cool! Sand bottom + waterslide + lazy river + three Jacuzzis = 3 acres of fun! No matter the ages of the people in your party, if they like pools, they will like this one! We never had a problem finding a place to sit. PLENTY of lounge chairs and clean dry towels. Bus Transportation: Just a short walk from the main entrance of the hotel is where the buses stop for transportation to the parks (the water parks included). Our expectations were met for our journies to the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom; a short wait and we were on a short ride to our destination. We were on a vacation, so we weren\u2019t looking at our watches timing every aspect of the bus experience; but our experience was acceptable. I suppose you could drive your own car; but we didn\u2019t want to rent a car and pay $12 a night to park at the resort and then drive to the parks, pay to park, find parking, and then walk to the entrance. The buses never made a stop after picking us up at the Beach Club resort, and they dropped us off near the entrance of the parks. Slick as snot! Access to Epcot/Hollywood Studios: The Resort is a mere 5-minute walk from the resort to the International Gateway Entrance at Epcot, and an easy 15-minute walk to Hollywood Studios along a nicely maintained walkway. We walked to Hollywood Studios 6-8 times; and we either arrived before the boat that we would have taken, or shortly thereafter. I\u2019d definitely suggest walking back to the resort from Hollywood Studios if there is a line for the boat. Beach: Every night at 8pm the resort inflates a big movie screen and plays a DVD for families. Our son loved watching movies at the beach while playing in the sand. I grabbed some fish and chips from Epcot and we all had a great time. I believe on Saturday nights(but it may be every night) they have a campfire prior to the movie and make smores! Food: There are a few places to eat on site. We had two meals at Cape May\u2019s (a buffet style restaurant near the main lobby of the hotel) and 3 or 4 meals at Hurricane Hannah\u2019s (counter service near the pool). No complaints for either location. Good food, fast service and seated immediately. If you make the short walk across to the Boardwalk; there are other restaurants there (we only ate at the ESPN Zone on the Boardwalk). Concierge: Simply awesome! They can assist in securing reservations (or even canceling them if you cannot use an ADR) and have answers to any questions that you may have!

The Beach and Yacht Club hotels, designed by Robert Stern, are separate, but joined by a corridor of restaurants and other shared facilities such as the main pool. They are 2 of the 5 hotels within walking distance to the International Gateway entrance to EPCOT (which is NOT the main entrance). The other EPCOT hotels are the Boardwalk Inn and Villas and the Swan (where I've stayed) and Dolphin, both whimsically designed by Michael Graves, and both affiliated with but not owned by Disney. The Disney Hollywood Studios park is accessible by boat or a not unpleasant 15 minute walk. The Beach and Yacht Clubs are considered Deluxe Disney resorts, as opposed to Moderate or Value resorts. These categories relate to extensiveness of decor and landscaping, sit-down restaurants vs. food courts, amenities, recreation, room size, price, and proximity to theme parks. The oyster gray-coloured Yacht Club, where I've stayed before, has a more sedate vibe than the light blue-coloured Beach Club, which seems more informal and family-oriented, in part because there is a light green -coloured Beach Club Villas building adjacent, on a patch of land where there used to be tennis courts. Part of the gift shop in the Beach Club has been converted into a mini-market/quick meal service restaurant, while the Yacht Club shop remains strictly a gift shop. The Yacht Club has a Club Level and a convention center. Each hotel has a small quiet pool, as does the villas, but they all share the large main pool complex, called Stormalong Bay, one of the most elaborately themed pools of any Disney resort. They use a wristband policy during busy times. There is also a beach and marina along the lake , where movies are shown at night, and campfire singalongs are held. We had rented a car, so the gate attendant asked for our name and gave us a parking pass. Self-parking is free, as is parking at any theme park with the pass. The parking attendant informed the entry host of our arrival, because they welcomed us by name and escorted us to the front desk. The room we were given met our basic needs but was not ideal. It was a ground floor room, so somewhat dark. The patio looked out onto a pathway people took to EPCOT, so privacy was lacking. It was near the beginning of a long corridor of rooms, so hallway noise was very audible through the door. Due to the building's configuration, our room was 3-4 feet shorter that most, so we did not have the sofa/daybed other rooms had. Thus, the only chair in the room was the desk chair. The desk does have a table on wheels beneath it that can serve as a dining/play table. Cute Mickey desk lamp. The sliding shelves and mini-fridge that once held the minibar are now barren, the better to fill with your own goods. The split bath had a roomy double sink area and a tiny shower-toilet room (apparently Disney is infamous for this)--the door comes to within less than an inch of the unoccupied toilet seat when closing. This being a very popular resort constantly filled with excited rambunctious children, conventioneers and foreign tourists, the room furnishings showed much wear and tear. The size of your balcony at the Beach Club varies with floor level; the Yacht Club balconies seem to be of more uniform size. The Y & B Clubs have 3 sit-down restaurants (one is a clambake), a classic soda fountain, and a quick-serve place by the pool. There are 2-3 lounges, and also the dining options at the Boardwalk, Swan and Dolphin. Food Network Iron Chef Cat Cora has a newish restaurant at the Boardwalk. We frequented the soda shop twice, but frankly did a lot of eating at EPCOT, where the annual Food and Wine Festival was being held. Many countries have little food pavilions set up around the World Showcase, offering a selection of small tastes, plus wines and alcohol. Delicious--and withing walking distance. Overall a nice hotel, with lots to keep families occupied even if you don't go to a park. But easy access to 2 parks is the biggest draw, because this is rather rare--I can only think of the Contemporary Resort being within walking distance to the Magic Kingdom, although the Grand Floridian (where I have also stayed) and Polynesian have easy monorail access. Any of the EPCOT resorts are worth considering for this fact alone.", "Date": "October 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Alex, VA", "Title": "\u201cBest Vacation Ever\u201d", "Author": "bkohler", "ReviewID": "UR84532885", "Content": "Just returned from a 6 night stay at Disney's Beach Club Resort.

Yes, the resort is gorgeous, the proximity to EPCOT is amazing and very convenient, the pool area rivals no other on WDW property, and if you have money to spend, you are at the right place. We did not like how the resort was so large and spread out. Originally or rooms were far apart from each other and to the main elevators. We got this switched with some hassle the next day, due to my mom needing to be on the second level with her knee issues. The biggest complain was that the quick service food was very limited. Other than rolls and cereal, there were only 3 options for b-fast and only flat bread pizza or a few sandwiches for dinner/lunch. This was very disappointing as we depend on quick service for our b-fasts and for last minute and late night meals. It is located in a small area that gets swamped early morning for b-fast and those filling up mugs. The pool area is nothing short of spectacular and if you stay at this resort, budget 2-3 afternoons to spend here if you have children. The concierge and bell services were extremely helpful and accommodating. The front desk and housekeeping had a lot of mis-communication which resulted in us waiting a while for clean rooms upon our room switch.

First of all we upgraded our room to concierge, club level. For a family of 4 it was worth every penny! We had a beautiful, large room with 2 queen beds and a daybed. We had plenty of room to walk around and didn't get into each other's space, very nice! Our 4 year old made a lot of \"Ooh and ah\" comments throughout the resort, too cute! We stayed on the 2nd floor and our balcony faced a private pool that is open until midnight, but they will let you stay later if you don't make noise. It also has a jacuzzi along side of it. The other pools close @ 10pm. The concierge service on the 5th floor was amazing. The staff will do anything to please you. The appetizers were tasty, everything from cheese, fruit, crackers and usually 2 hot appetizers like egg rolls, bacon wrapped scallops, quesadillas, stuff like that. 3 different wines to choose from, about 4 different beers, sodas and Evian bottled water. We usually brought beer, wine and appetizers back to our room when we were too tired to hang out in the lounge. The lounge is nice but it can become crowded especially around 5ish and at breakfast. There's a nice little area for kids with their own TV. My son's luggage was lost on arrival (because it did not have a Disney luggage slip/ tag on it). It was retrieved after following up more than 2x with the front desk. That's the only complaint we have. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH DISNEY LUGGAGE STRAPS/TAGS!!!!

Our room wasn't ready when we arrived so they upgraded us to a full Crescent Lake View room. This room (1561) also wasn't ready, so they put a rush on it for us. It was about 4:30 p.m. by now and we were tired after our long trip from Nova Scotia. For the inconvenience they credited us a $50 bonus to our account to use as we pleased, which we accepted. We were too tired to agrue anyway. The room is the perfect location - about 10 steps from the quiet pool, which we seniors appreciated. Directly is front of our patio doors was the most beautiful view of Crescent Lake with the sandy beach, swings and lounger chairs. About three minutes through the quiet pool area is the path for Epcot entrance. Everything was so close to our room it made it easy for everything we wanted to do at the hotel. My sister and her husband had room 4585 which they too loved because they wanted a full balcony. About 3 minutes in the other direction, up the beach from Crescent Lake is the boat launch for transportation to Hollywood Studios and The Boardwalk. You can also take the scenic route by boat to Epcot too if you want. The first night we had reservations at Cape May for dinner. The seafood buffet was truly amazing. I thought my brother-in-law and husband would sprout fins they ate so much fish. My sister and I stuck with the more traditional stuff, great soups, salads and roast beef as well. We had the Disney meal plan and truly had more food than we could possibly eat, especially at the table service meals which includes the buffet meals too. My one and only complaint which, after so much luxury, seems petty - is the MARGARINE they use in ALL Disney restaurants. I am not a fussy eater, but it really tastes like the cheap stuff they used in the early 1950's after the war to save money. I was really surprised Disney would use this stuff because it seems like such a small portion of the otherwise luxurious meals they have. If this bothers you too, I suggest taking a small container of your own brand butter or margarine. As with all Disney staff, DBC staff are all pleasant and accommodating. The lazy river and Storm-along-bay are a dream come true for kids who love the water. The large water slides complete the picture for them. We can't wait to go again.

My wife and I have stayed at other hotels at Disney, but we have stayed the most at the Beach Club because it has a number of advantages: 1. The hotel is in the EPCOT resort area. This means that you can walk to EPCOT, and take a short boat ride to Hollywood Studios. It is also within walking distance of numerous restaurants at the Beach Club and Yacht Club, at EPCOT, and at other hotels in the EPCOT area. Morevoer, we like to eat a big breakfast, and there is a breakfast buffet at the Cape May Cafe in the Beach Club, and also at the restaurant in the Yacht Club (you will definitely need reservations for the Cape May Cafe breakfast, as it is a character breakfast). 2. If you drive like we do, the Beach Club is a relatively short distance away from Animal Kingdom, Downtown Disney, and the miniature golf and water park locations. 3. The rooms are genarally big by Disney World standards, and are always clean. Moreover, Disney seems to have maintenance going on at all times, so nothing ever looks worn out or dated. 4. I am a bad sleeper, and yet I can sleep well in certain areas of the Beach Club. All of the rooms have relatively good inside soundproofing, and the beds and sheets are very comfortable, which is a good start to getting sleep no matter where you are. However, unlike many of the Disny hotels, the Beach Club has a quiet side, which is the side facing the trees between the Beach Club and EPCOT. It is also quiet in the area between the Beach Club and the Beach Club villas. 5. It shares a fantastic pool complex, Stormalong Bay, with the Yacht Club. It also has a quiet pool that is near the entrance to EPCOT. One drawback for couples is that the Becah Club has very few king rooms (I think only around a dozen rooms in the whole place), but we have been able to get a king room on two of our five trips there. The other drawback of the Beach Club, and any other deluxe Disney hotel for that matter, is price. The rack rate for its rooms will generally be more than $400 per night, which is why my wife and I have generally only stayed there when Disney is running a big discount program. The past couple of years we have gotten 40% off, and I would only stay on Disney property in the future if we can get a significant discount.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "long island", "Title": "\u201cGood first trip choice with young children\u201d", "Author": "relentlessjen", "ReviewID": "UR78416106", "Content": "1st good trip with my husband, 3 boys (4, 8 and 9) Location is great because we were a very short walk to Epcot and the boardwalk.

This time around, however, we stayed at the Beach Club just to experience the resort itself with no trips to the theme park and we were NOT disappointed. Lobby The grounds and lobby are magnificent. The cast members were attentive (no wait!) and everything looked spot on. Highly recommend online check in. Our room was immediately available and, after a little help with a broken door handle, discovered that we had been upgraded to a lagoon view room for free! Rooms Lots of different room types here....ours has two queen-sized beds and a pullout. The rooms have been updated in great fabrics and a flat-panel TV. We had our own balcony overlooking the garden, beach, and lake beyond. Great view. Plenty of space, great bathroom, fantastic beds, not too much noise from the hallway. Pool This is where we camped for the weekend. Despite a few changes (no more quicksand) the pool is still amazing after almost 20 years. Waterslide was great, plenty of sand to make sandcastles, and spent two easy afternoons getting sunburned. Also ordered two pi\u00f1a colavas (have to try them!) which were expensive but yummy and part of the beach experience. Beaches and Cream A great little soda shop complete with hamburgers, malts and a jukebox you can request songs from. Since we were the \"guests of the day\"...first ones in at 11 am...they upgraded our sundae to epic proportions. Great food, great atmosphere, very beachy and casual. A great lunch spot. Beach Club Marketplace Great place for grab and go food. Also free refills on the Disney resort mugs. Visited there often. Transportation Even though theme parks weren't our objective this trip we did decide to take advantage of extra magic hours late one night at Magic Kingdom. The MK is a bus ride away though on this trip we had NO WAIT for a bus on the way there or back. Amazing, I know, but there it is. Hollywood Studios is only a boat ride away and Epcot is the real winner within walking distance of the International Gateway entrance.

We did not eat at the restaurants so we can not comment on those. Based on the upscale restaurants that we ate elsewhere, I would save the money. Finally, we have to comment about Stormalong Bay. We do not undersntand all the hype. A slide at a pool is not a major thing. The pool was really no better than at most major resorts. The towel service was appreciated, but nothing really stood out. Overall, we think the fact the resort was within the Disney complex allows it to survive. We would never stay at this hotel for its price at a different location. We think its association with Disney clouds people's vision. $10/day for internet service and televisionservice which only has Disney/ABC/ESPN channels is really unacceptable. Would we stay there again? Only if we got the deal we did since you get extra Disney hours, transportation, and transit from the airport. However, if you do not want to be bound to the bus, want a better pool, and better food choices, I would stay elsewhere.", "Date": "August 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cIt doesn't get much better than the Beach Club!!!!\u201d", "Author": "FamilyandFun5", "ReviewID": "UR74472531", "Content": "I could go on all day about how much we love the Beach Club! This was our second stay of 9 days and we enjoyed every second. We are a family of five and rooms were spacious and soooo comfortable. The soft, cozy, beds are amazing and there was a sofa that converted into a single bed for our 9 year old. The pool is unmatched in Disney and the poolside staff are the best on Disney property. Check in and concierge were more than happy to assist me with everything I needed and housekeeping was there at 2am when my daughter got sick, twice. You will not be disappointed with the Beach Club. You can easily walk to Epcot and the Boardwalk. We spend a lot of time at the hotel (because we go to Disney often and do not spend the entire day in the parks) and this is the perfect place to hang by the pool during the day, enjoy the family poolside activities with the kids, and then hit Beaches and cream for some wonderful treats. It has been hard to find another place that compares to the Beach Club. Disney has spoiled us!!! Be sure to roast some marshmallows on the beach at night, watch a movie on the beach with the family, and tie-dye Mickey shirts by the pool! LOVE LOVE LOVE the Beach Club! We will not stay any other place in Disney again, the Beach Club is the best by FAR! (((Just a little side note: My only complaint is lack of free internet. I understand why they do it but for the cost of the room, it should be included. I was taking some online classes and had to have internet access during my stay. I only used it for a couple of hours our entire stay but had to pay $10. for each day I logged on.)))))", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Centralia, IL", "Title": "\u201cPerfection ... again!!\u201d", "Author": "dffcpa", "ReviewID": "UR74089892", "Content": "My family accompanied me on a business conference that was held at the Swan Hotel; however, as we have stayed many times at Disney's Beach Club Resort, we opted to stay at the Beach Club for the \"home\" feel it offers us. As stated, we have stayed at the Beach Club numerous times over the years, and have yet to have a bad experience. Walking in the front door is like returning home to us, although we still fondly miss Art the doorman! The addition of the Beach Club Villas (DVC) has resulting in the gift shop evolution into a gift shop/food pantry/food bar; however, the resulting increased traffic flow in that area is offset by the availability of an added dining option. We used the online check-in process and it went spotlessly smooth and very quick; we were on our way to the room within just moments of walking in the front door of the hotel. This is the second time we used the online check-in process and it has worked as advertised for us. The hotel staff perform ideally in my opinion ... they are available when needed, do whatever is asked of them, will return a smile with a smile or hello, but do not overwhelm you. Housekeeping does a consistently good job. I realize this is not an inexpensive hotel and, as such, pampering is traditionally expected; however, one look around the theming, the grounds, facilities, transportation/benefits and location will explain the hotel pricing. The clambake at Cape May Cafe is our favorite meal when at Disney, and we enjoyed it twice on our recent trip; both meals were excellent; the staff is very enjoyable and friendly, and one never feels rushed. Also, Beaches and Cream Soda Shop is a fun place to have a great quick lunch/dinner; the offerings are limited; however, everything on the menu is made to order and very good. The No Way Jose Sundae remains my number one treat in the World!! (Disney, please place this back on the take-out menu for those times I NEED my No Way Jose fix addressed quickly???). That takes us to location; it remains my opinion the Beach Club Resort is the most ideally located of all of the Disney resorts. The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Epcot Center, Boardwalk and the boat transportation to Hollywood Studios. The walk to Hollywood Studios is actually similar in time to the boat ride, and a very nice, peaceful walk along the water. Finally, one cannot forget to mention Stormalong Bay, the wonderful water recreation area of the hotel and, in my opinion, the best Disney Resort pool area. It can be crowded and loud, but is always a fun place with numerous daily planned activities. Hurricane Hanna's is located in this area for food and drink. The staff members do a great job with their enthusiasm. There are also quiet pools available if one seeks some peaceful pool time. Overall, the Beach Club Resort is simply a very enjoyable, safe and comfortable place to spend your time at Disneyworld, and it has retained its' seaside charm over the years.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBig on Location and Amenities - low on overall Disney Wow factor.\u201d", "Author": "Page21Austin", "ReviewID": "UR73917505", "Content": "We stayed at Beach Club last October 2009 (and yes, I'm tardy in posting this review), but I wanted to get this out since the International Food and Wine Festival will be rolling around again in October and that was the primary reason that we chose to stay at BC - location. You will read it again and again here in the reviews....BC is the absolute closest to EPCOT - 5 minute walk. It's true. And the shortest wait to get through the gates any time during the day. If EPCOT is your destination, and you can afford a Deluxe Resort, then definitely consider Beach Club. We used the Online Check-In - I can't give it a thumbs up unfortunately and I'm really trying to be fair. I would have been better off standing in the standard check in line - now that line was moving! It was one of those situations where the customer at the counter had what seemed like thousands of problems, questions, issues, and things that should have been taken care of at the Concierge Desk, not at the OnLine Check In. The Disney Cast Member was trying to help, but due to a language barrier/issue, the situation kept going on and on, and instead of calling or asking for help from a Manager, she just let it continue. My issue was that she never acknowledged me or redirected me to the other lines. Not the best start to a 10 day vacation. I actually have to agree with some of the other reviews here in that, I didn't find the overall staff to be at the typical Disney level of superior. I was a little disappointed. I can't quite put my finger on it, but there was a general malaise and at times I felt like I was bothering them when I just asking for even the smallest thing at the front desk. It's nothing to keep me from coming back to a Disney property.....we are booked for this December 2010 at the Polynesian actually! We've also stayed at BoardWalk, and we actually liked the atmosphere at BoardWalk better. Besides the fantastic pool at BC (Stormalong Bay), my opinion is that BC is not huge on overall Disney WOW appeal. My daughters (ages 11 and 8) were not overwhelmed by the theming of the hotel. It's lovely, but they didn't really get it. That's not a negative, but I think having stayed before at the Polynesian, the Animal Kingdom Lodge, the Wilderness Lodge, and even the Disneyland Hotel in California, they expected a heavier Disney theming in the hotel. BC is very subtle, and that appeals to many (especially after being bombarded by so much at the parks), but I just want to put it out there if you or your family is expecting something different. The room size is standard for a Deluxe Disney hotel. We had 3 kids and 2 adults on this trip. It was sufficient - of course, a suite would have been better, but we made do. Definitely eat at Beaches 'n Cream Soda Shop while you are there....or at least get an ice cream treat. I would say skip the Cape May Buffet and head over to the Yacht Club for their breakfast buffet instead. Unless you just absolutely must spend the bucks to see Characters again while you eat. We didn't think it was worth it. The Yacht Club's \"Captains Grille\" has a nice buffet breakfast for a better price (although no characters) but we didn't need reservations and it was much less stressful. Also, check out the bar at the Yacht Club, the Crew's Cup Lounge. We stopped in there several times in the afternoon and had snacks and beverages (our kids were allowed to join us). It was nice to sit, watch some ESPN, have some appetizers, and chill out. The movies on the beach at night are fun and were a cool surprise for the kids. It's a great way to unwind.

It was very simple. Staff All of the cast members were very helpful and friendly, though we didn't have much interaction with them. Room Honestly, for being as expensive as it was, the room was a bit disappointing. It was very spacious and looked clean. However, the wallpaper was beginning to wear, as well as the carpets and the bathrooms were disappointingly small. The bed was very soft and provided a very comfortable place to relax after a day of activity. The walls were very thin, and both rooms beside us had very loud children. If you're a sensitive sleeper and wake up easily, you'll find it difficult to get a full night's rest in these room. You can hear people walking down the hallway even when they aren't being incredibly loud. The view from our balconey was wonderful. We overlooked the \"quiet pool\" and the boardwalk. It was stunning at night. Amenities There were numerous chairs available, but as others have said, it was difficult to find one because they had all been claimed by a towel. The main pool stays busy, and it can be a bit of a maze the first time you enter. The quiet pool was the best part about the hotel. Each time we were there, there were at most 10 people in the pool. At its deepest, it is just over 4ft, but it provides a relaxing atmosphere, and there is a spa located next to it which is very relaxing as well. The prices of items at the resort itself were surprisingly reasonable. (With the exception of food in the marketplace). Location If you are planning on going to Epcot during your stay, you can't beat the location. The back park entrance (by England in the World Showcase) was a two minute walk from our room. We went to the park early, returned to the pool at 3 and went to watch the fireworks at 8. Very convenient. From the boardwalk you can see a little bit of the fireworks, but you really can't see much. The Bowardwalk itself can provide a couple of hours of entertainment. There are quite a few restaurants and shops to browse. Food While we were there we ate at three places outside the parks. We ate the ESPN club, which was our best dining experience. We didn't have to wait for a table and our appetizer and alcohol came out very quickly. Our waitress was very friendly and the food was very good. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a casual dining atmosphere. We also ate at Big River Grille, which I do NOT recommend. We were really looking forward to the dinner, as we were celebrating a birthday and an engagement, but we were thoroughly disappointed with the evening. We stood in front of the host for a full minute before he ever acknowledged our presence, and when he finally did he was not friendly in the least. When we were finally given a buzzer, we watched as empty tables sat unbussed for at least 10 minutes. We saw one table that was ready to be seated, and was ready for 5 minutes before our buzzer went off. The service was terribly slow. As far as the actual food went, I ordered the chicken alfredo and it was incredibly bland. It definitely wasn't worth the money we paid for it. The other place we ate was the Beaches and Cream soda shop. The staff here was much more friendly and inviting and we didn't have to wait to be seated. However, the service was very slow. We ordered two sundaes and a side of french fries and we were in the shop for over an hour, we didn't sit around after we received the check either. So I can definitely see why the tables are always full, they aren't very concerned with turnover. The sundaes were delicious and you got a lot for your money. The only downside was the service speed, so I would certainly recommend it if you're craving ice cream. Summary Overall, I would only recommend if you plan on spending a lot of time there. If your plan is to go to the parks all day and only come back to the resort to sleep, then you're just wasting your money.

There was no bigger Disney fan than I. Nine new families go because of our recommendations. I never had a single complaint about ANYONE who worked at WDW. In fact, I always believed that every cast member I ever dealt with always went well beyond any expectation I ever had. I have a son with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, and I credit WDW for encouraging a lot of wonderful social breakthroughs for him. Our newest \u201cfavorite\u201d Disney hotel was the Beach Club Resort. It had casual elegance, an unbelievable pool, and unbeatable location. We had stayed at the BCR two other times without any negative incident. Our third visit to the BCR occurred this past May: May 11-18, 2010. Disney is advertising 2010 as the \u201cYear of Celebrations\u201d. What better place to go for our wedding anniversary and son\u2019s birthday combined? And while every other place and cast member on Disney property rose to their usual above and beyond outstanding service, a few staff at the BCR ruined every single day of our stay, except one. Keep in mind, I don\u2019t think I have ever lodged a complaint against anyone, at Disney or anywhere else. During our stay at the BCR this May, the staff at the hotel started our vacation by telling us in a very belligerent tone that our standard view room wasn\u2019t ready, and check in was at 4 pm. Even though I was bewildered at the tone of voice and even though I knew check in was at 3 pm, I said, ok, just asking, no big deal. We dropped off our bags, and walked to Epcot. Hours later, while we were having a great time, I received a call telling me that our room wasn\u2019t ready. In fact, the room that we had chosen from a list they had given us to choose from had been trashed by people who stayed there the night before. I asked about the state of the mattresses. The manager on the phone hesitated and didn\u2019t answer. We were then offered another standard view room instead, and we were checked in a little after 3 pm. The next day, my husband discovered that the front desk had \u201clost\u201d my husband\u2019s credit card information! My husband\u2019s attempt to find out where his cc information went, was met by VERY nasty, nonchalant, staff who tried to blame HIM. This made my husband angry enough to complain to a wonderful manager, who reimbursed my husband the amount he (the manager) deemed fair. My husband came back totally pixie dusted! My husband was so grateful for the manager\u2019s kind regard, he took the money the manager credited our account, and put it right back into WDW, by using it to purchase me two Dooney Bourke handbags they sell in the WDW gift shops .Day three was great, no problem. Day 4, the day before our wedding anniversary, we came back from lunch to discover that my expensive designer bathing suit was missing from my room! So, while my family went to see Chubby Checker at Epcot, I spent the evening dealing with the BCR managers. I was reimbursed the depreciated value of my suit. From this point on, I was getting upset at the BCR, but was trying to be a lady. But, now my child was afraid to leave his camera equipment in the room: he was concerned with theft and \u201cpeople looking through my stuff\u201d. I was upset because half the reason we booked at the BCR to begin with, a DELUXE hotel that charges people $400 plus per night for that privilege, was to swim in their amazing 3 acre pool. To find ANY one piece swimsuit in a size 4 or 6 on Disneyworld property proved impossible. I am a 46 year old mother. I am not bikini material. If a middle aged man reads this, the equivalent would be like asking you to wear a speedo ot thong. I don\u2019t know a single woman over 40 who finds a flattering suit without the help of a good designer and lots of time trying suits on .Consequently, by the third full day of our 8 day trip, I could no longer use the pool that we paid so much money to enjoy. After the disappearance of my suit was reported to management (my suit was NEVER found), housekeeping abruptly stopped giving us ANY service at all. We felt this neglect was retaliatory for the complaint about the missing suit to management. A male housekeeper met my husband in the hall the next day and snapped \u201cYOU don\u2019t want housekeeping!\u201d very aggressively, the day after we reported the suit missing. For two days, we would call housekeeping and beg them to give us service, and report when we left the room, not to return for 6 or more hours, because we REALLY needed service. No one came. Finally, when we no longer even had toilet paper (not to mention towels, shampoo, or soap); I broke down. I asked a manager in the lobby if it was too much to expect for a Deluxe Disney resort to provide toilet paper. I burst into tears. We were all so stressed from one mishap after the other by BCR staff, we just wanted to go home. The manager kept telling my husband that he was too busy, with a hotel at 40% capacity, to be bothered with what he considered our small issues. He snidely accused my husband of wanting to \u201cprofit\u201d from this situation (?!?) Immediately after dealing with that manager, we went to the Polynesian Resort for our dinner reservations. We were all three so angry, stressed, and upset at how badly we were treated, that I had to fight back tears, my husband just sat in the lobby, looking dangerously angry, and my poor son had a severe meltdown, and sat in the men\u2019s room for two solid hours due to a series of extreme panic attacks.. A wonderful young man who worked at the front desk of the Poly helped me talk my son out of his anxiety attack and into a cab back to the BCR, where we slunk back to our room feeling horrible about being trapped there. To this day, I pray for that young man, and the waiter at Le Cellier, who was the only one to acknowledge our anniversary with two glasses of surprise champagne, the last day of our trip. No one at the BCR cared. In fact, when we told them it was our anniversary, they treated us like we wanted something. Uh, yeah, we wanted what we paid for: deluxe service. I believe everywhere on earth, that does include toilet paper! The same manager, who was rude and insulting, continued his taunting and coercion until we went home. I cried several time in the remaining two days, particularly after said manager insinuated that there never WAS a swim suit!! I burst into tears, and gave a minute description to the Yacht Club manager, who was a lovely person who tried to comfort me. I knew at that second, my beautiful suit would never be found( and I was right. I was told that a BCR manager was sent to supervise the sifting through of the laundry)! The nasty manager at the BCR made it a point to show up to crow triumphantly at our departing backs as the Magical Express drove us away. This manager did things like this from the second we asked him for help: he kept going out of his way to be in my husband\u2019s face and taunt him into a silent, helpless fury. I had thought about this many times since: did it ever occur to this manager that his need to dominate and humiliate his male \u201cguests\u201d could result in another guest taking their futile rage on their little children with their fists? I have seen families at WDW who looked like they wouldn\u2019t have needed half the anger this man supplied. I am fortunate that my husband was a man who understood that he was deliberately being baited. In my opinion, this was done because they knew we did nothing wrong, THEY did. They ruined our vacation, but wanted to shift the blame onto us. If my suit never showed up, they could claim I lied. If they could bait my husband into losing his temper, then they could say we somehow deserved the horrific treatment we were subjected to. When I told this manager that I intended to write a letter of complaint, he laughed and said, \u201cGo Ahead!\u201d in a way that told me that he knew he could act with impunity. He was right. I wrote no less than five letters to Guest Communications,the WDW President , and even the very top. The responses ranged from a verbal apology (WDW is very careful not to put anything in writing), to ridicule, and finally ignoring us. With the second letter, I asked to be reimbursed for the days at the hotel (minus the day and one half the first manager reimbursed), at the discounted price that we paid, $264.00 per night, and I listed. I also stated that, instead of money, I would be receptive to reimbursement in the form of another deluxe hotel stay for 5 days. I already knew that 40% capacity was considered a hardship: they had the rooms. Stupid me, I thought it would be a cheaper way for them, considering their mark up on their prices; and the fact that we usually spend tons of money on food, drinks, and other goodies. They would still turn a nice profit, and it would have shown us good faith. It would have been a way to show us that we wouldn\u2019t be abused a second time around. I would never consider paying them another $5,000 and placing myself in their power unless they made some gesture. Had Disney shown good faith and remorse for destroying our anniversary, they would have been pleasantly surprised: it is the principle for me. No one in my family even wants to go back, and we don\u2019t have the time anyway. Instead, the woman on the phone said they felt they did all they were interested in doing for our family, and insinuated she had my letters, so to shut up and just take it. I found that puzzling, as I have no problem with what I put in writing at all, including the suggestion to be reimbursed. I believe that it is the right thing for them to do. Although the person who was delegated the responsibility of our complaint promised to call us last week, she never did. Instead, I had to email. At that, she called, and said she believed the BCR, and they felt they reimbursed us enough with the suit and the first manager. I guess when that manager at the BCR encouraged me to write my complaints; he knew nothing would be done. WDW seemed bitterly angry that they already reimbursed us for the incidents occurring our first day and one half: the trashed room and late check in, lost cc information, nastiness, and and theft of my property (at what they considered it\u2019s depreciated value) granted them license to be as nasty, bullying, and withholding amenities we had paid for, for the remaining six days we were forced to stay in their hotel . My family had to go use the pool bathroom because we weren\u2019t even given toilet paper. At a deluxe hotel! We are being painted as mercenary because I had politely requested reimbursement for the discounted price we paid for the ruined hotel days only. That\u2019s actually funny. The BCR destroyed our vacation and celebration, and WDW doesn\u2019t care. They didn\u2019t back us, the guests, at all. The fact that we had been loyal fans who spent over $60,000.00 at their resort, and brought 8-9 new families MEANT NOTHING TO THEM. The pixie dust bubble was popped right in front of my face. We had been to WDW 11 times before where nothing bad happened. Unfortunately, when things did go wrong, WDW did not feel accountable for promises they made to us regarding our time, effort, planning, money, and trust. In fact, Guest Communications went out of their way to make things a lot worse .The woman on the phone even had the nerve to tell me, smugly, that they would continue to take our money for future trips. When I said it for what it was, they just want our money, she said, \u201cYup\u201d. Needless to say, I have informed my travel agents. They said, \u201cYOU, of all people, have a problem with Disney??\u2019, and after listening, told me Disney\u2019s behavior toward me and mine was disgusting. Fortunately, when I called my credit card company to see if I could dispute the hotel stay only, they didn't even get past hearing about the trashed room before they also said, \"disgusting!\" like my travel agent. I used to be like all the other reviewers here: all it took was some incompetence and the worst manager I've ever seen just let things keep escalating until now I feel I have to warn everyone: especially those who are planning to due to my recommendation.

It's hard for me to pick a favorite resort at WDW. We've stayed at the Contemporary twice, the Polynesian 1x and now the Beach Club 1x. They are all great resorts with different benefits to each. If you like to spend time in Epcot and Hollywood Studios, this location cannot be beaten. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, friendly castmembers and an amazing pool make this a great family vacation resort. This was our first Beach Club stay and we were NOT disappointed. The entire staff at the Beach Club are some of the nicest and most helpful CM's we've ever encountered. Check-in was a breeze. Of course we arrived on a Wednesday morning at 8:20 a.m. When we drove up, the gate guard had radioed ahead to let them know we were arriving so they greeted us by name. Someone escorted me directly to the on-line check in counter where we received a warm welcome and our packet of information. Our room wasn't quite ready, but we received our KTTW and were on our way to the MK bus in less than 10 minutes. The pool was phenomenal! The sand bottom pool was one of the major factors in choosing to stay at this resort. I did have to laugh when I overheard another adult guest say \"There's sand in the pool. You'd think they'd clean that out.\" The pool is huge and winding and there is something for everyone. A very shallow beach (ranging from approx. 18 in. to 2 1/2 feet deep) pool area for young children; a lazy river, a child size water slide, a larger faster waterslide, two hot tubs, a whirlpool area and some deeper swimming areas. And that's just the theme pool. There's also a quiet pool on the other side of the property which is a traditional style pool and a separate jacuzzi. Pool Hint -- if you're driving, bring a noodle for the pool if you like them. You can't use your own tubes or child swim rings, but you can use a noodle. The tubes that are available to rent at the swim hut are $3/hr. or $10 day. The price was fine, but they don't have child size tubes and the ones they have are a bit too big for a small child. My 4 year old loves the lazy river, but she was too small for the tube. We rented one for her, but she kept falling through, and since she is a \"big girl\" she didn't want to share a tube with me. You can also purchase noodles in the gift shop for $5. It was a bit of a hike to the waterslide from the pool. Too far to let your small child go unattended as you have to leave the pool area completely and go across the public walkway. It was a fun slide though. I loved it and my 4 year old did too. Children need to be able to swim to go down the big slide. It dumps into about 4 - 4 1/2 feet of water at the bottom. There is a poolside counterservice restaurant with good lunchtime fare, burgers, salads, wraps, etc. The kids meals are served in a sand bucket w/shovel that the children can use at the beach area of the pool. We had a standard view room and I requested \"courtyard view.\" We had room 3632 which was far enough away from the elevator that we didn't hear elevator noise but close enough that it was very convenient. We overlooked a nice little courtyard and had the European style walk out only balcony. The beds and pillows were very comfy and there was ample storage in the room. Double sinks and plenty of counterspace in the vanity area which was separated from the shower and toilet area was convenient when family was all trying to shower and get dressed. The Marketplace had very few counter service offerings, but had much more grocery store type offerings for the room if you needed that type of merchandise. The Marketplace was also the Beach Club's gift shop. It's on the small side for a WDW gift shop, but it had the basic gift shop offerings. We had no problems with transportation from the resort. It was a quick walk to the International Gateway entrance to Epcot (which is located between France and England in the World Showcase) and a short boat ride to Hollywood Studios. We had quick bus service to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. If we were returning from Magic Kingdom in the afternoon we took the monorail to Epcot and walked through the Future World to the International Gateway to get back to our hotel.", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunfermline, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, nice hotel but expensive\u201d", "Author": "Redal66", "ReviewID": "UR70306357", "Content": "There are several good points about this hotel, the location next to the boardwalk is fantastic and Epcot is only a 10 minute walk.

I'm sure there is a logical reason, but I'd rather be able to stay in the water, not have to climb out every time we wanted to explore another section.

I think it is worth the money. Disney Express was good, processing was fast, driver friendly and helpful, journey easy with the intro video. We check-in online, so it is a breeze to get to our room. We felt like special guest, Amanda was very polite and apologetic when our first room didn't work out because of the sink. But it was taken care of speedily, and we have another room. The laundry rooms were 24 hrs. I never have to wait for others to do their laundry. Beaches and Cream was great and we didn't have to wait long. Anyway, they allow you to play in the next door Lafferty arcade room while carrying an electronic buzzer to wait for their call. The pool and slide is great as mentioned by many others. The walk to EPCOT takes about 5-10 mins. depending on which part of resort your room is. The boat to DHS and the return trip were frequent and took about 10-15 mins each way. The boardwalk is not far away, and it is romantic to dine by the lake. We also walked to the Swan hotel to be pick up for our Kennedy Space Centre tour with Gator tours. Buses to animal kingdom/ blizzard beach as well as to Magic Kingdom were easy to take from the front of the resort. Coming back from MK after Wishes at 10 p.m. was a concern to me before our trip, and I was planning to take the monorail to Contemporary Hotel to take a cab back. There were so many people at the monorail station. In the end, we tried the resort bus again, and it worked out well in the end. We reached the resort pretty fast too by this way.

I love the way Disney takes care of you the minute you step off the plane and get on one of their Magical Express buses. When we checked in we were greeted with a smile and were quickly processed. The styling of the Beach Club Resort is spot on - down to the Mickey's and Little Mermaid characters in the carpets in the hall. We had requested, back in the November of 2009, connecting rooms with our family and were not given this at check in (this happened another time at Port Orleans Riverside). They were very accommodating and found us two connecting rooms on the same floor (not really sure why were weren't given these to begin with), but we chose to stay in our rooms because of the top-notch view of the Boardwalk across from us. Another complaint we had was that our room had little to no storage. My sisters room had hooks and a great chest of drawers, and there were only two of them staying in that room. We had four people in our room but none of these amenities. The \"cast member\" I talked to at the front desk about possibly getting one put in our room was probably the rudest person I encountered in our whole 9 day trip. One other drawback, I think especially for families with small kids, is that they don't really have a food court or a large enough place to enjoy a counter service meal. They have a counter where you can get pizza's and sandwiches, in the marketplace, with a couple of tables, which were always full. Hurricane Hannah's at the pool had burgers and chicken, but stay away from the veggie wrap, it was NOT worth spending money on. However, you had to sit outside which, in the Florida heat, was not always appealing. Being so, so close to EPCOT and the world showcase (we took a left out of our room and in literally minutes were at the back gate - you couldn't even finish a drink in the time it took you to walk there) - we ate a lot there. The biggest draw for this resort has to be the pool (phenomenal!) and the great lifeguards (they do a dance at the \"changing of the guards\") and the \"cruise directors\" at the pool that always kept it fun and hopping for the kids. They had movies and s'mores on the beach, and the Boardwalk was a short walk around the lagoon.

First let me start off with the good...the location is great, across from the Boardwalk, next to Epcot and a short boat ride to MGM. The service when we checked in was great.

And kids will love spending time in the pool. Nice Bar/Grill by the Pool. Beaches and Cream ice cream was great. Nice Beach front. So let me touch on the bad The hotel is huge so we had a very very very long walk from our room to the Pool- my Daughter thought the maze of hallways was like the movie The Shinning. The Room and decor is dated - the hallway wallpaper is peeling, and the bathrooms in the room are not of a high quality (the drapery was nice) The Cape May Cafe- which we ate at for Dinner and for a character breakfast was not good at all. actually both my Husband and Daughter got sick after having the dinner Buffet. Rooms were cleaned very late in the day- cleaned well but late in the day. The pool water was way too hot!!!! Cant believe they could not fill it with cooler water- I mean about 98 degree hot- not at all refreshing. Much more expensive than other Disney resorts So all that being said would I stay here again - maybe. although because it is a little less I would consider the Boardwalk across the lake.

First off - for those of you who are budget conscious, the deluxe hotels are not for you. They are all expensive. We were lucky enough to get 40% off when we booked in February. That enabled us to stay. Our room which was normally $500 a night was $285. You pay for the location and the ammenedies. We have 2 small children aged 3 (almost 4) and 11 months old. We knew we had to stay at a resort that was close to all of the action, had a large room to accomodate our crib and have lots of stuff at the resort itself to do after the parks. There is no other hotel around Disney that offers as many great things. First off the rooms, very large and spaceous. We paid the extra to have a pool/water view. We were on the 2nd floor which meant we got a huge balcony. If you are on the 1st floor you get a patio, 2nd floor nice balcony. 3rd and 4th floors don't get much other than a little platform to stand out on. We had 2 queen size beds in our room. They were seperated by a wall, where we put our crib. It had 2 double sinks then a door to the bathroom. Lots of room for a couple kids to play around in, much different from the crampt confinds of the econo or even moderate resorts. We had a fridge and microwafe with is essencial for heating up baby food etc. I have heard some people say certain parts of the rooms or halls etc needed updating but I walked the whole hotel about 50 times and did not notice anything that looked worn or outdated. Some people will always be picky. Beds were very comfortable and we could not hear our neighbours beside or on top of us, contrary to other people's reviews. The heating / ac worked great, no complaints about the room. Housekeeping was good, nothing out of the ordinary there. The restaurants were great, but we were very happy to be on the Disney Dining plan. Any restaurant either at the hotel or at the parks for the 3 of us (2 adults, one child) was $40 for lunch and at least $85 for supper. The dining plan saved us huge. The character breakfast at Cape Mae's was great, but again - $82 for breakfast (if you had to pay for it) OUCH! Only complaint - the food quality at Beaches & Cream Ice Cream Parlour. Don't get me wrong, the ice cream was good, but their \"famous\" burgers were nothing special. The restaurant is extremely small. 2 booths and maybe 6 tables total, very small so if you go during a peak time you would wait forever to get seated. Cape Mae's buffet for b-fast and supper was good. Great mix of food. Also ate at the Captain's Grille - great steak and chicken. Did have a reservation for the Yachtsman Steakhouse, but we skipped it (too formal for a 1yr old) and had a character supper at Epcot instead. Pool - just like everyone else said - this was the selling point. No other resort in the world has a pool like the beach club. It is not all one large pool, rather a few pools all close together, seperated by a wall at best. They have a deeper tubing secion like a lazy river, other rapids areas where they have the jets turned up to take you round and round till your dizzy, areas with waterfalls and best of all for little kids - a 80x80ft or maybe bigger area that is only 2ft deep where they can play in the sand and run through the water. Everything is sand, its amazing. They keep the pool at I'd say 90 degrees, its bath water, which makes swimming at night amazing. There are lots of ducks and baby ducts that make the pool their home, so it feels as if you were swimming in a lake or ocean. There are also lifeguards every 20 feet or so which is very reassuring. The own downside when we were there, the main waterslide was closed, they were fixing it. They had movies on the beach every night for the kids and a campfire where you could roast marshmellows, very cool. Lots of souveneer stores between the Yacht Club and the Beach Club. We purchased cereal, oj, cinnimon buns at our store so we didn't have to pay for breakfast every day. One of the other great things is that you can pay $14 for a refillable mug which you can use at the resort for your whole trip, so unlimtied pop, lemonade, coffee, tea etc. That really came in handy. The resort is right on crescent lake, which means you can rent boats if that's your thing. We took a 21ft pontoon boat out for 90 minutes ($95) and had a blast. Took it around the lake, and down the 1.5mile straight to Hollywood Studios. Location - you are steps away from Epcot, less than a 5 minute walk, 5 minutes to the other side of the lake (Disney's Boardwalk). 10 minute boat ride to Hollywood Studios, 15 minute bus to Animal Kingtom. When it comes to the Magic Kingdom its 15 minutes by bus or maybe 20 or so by monorail. We far preferred walking into epcot and taking the monorail. It is such a pain to fold up double strollers and fight your way onto a bus. The monorail made it so much easier. We would definitley return to the Beach Club, as long as we booked at a \"special\" rate.

Well our first family vacation...Things got off to a pretty good start. We were looking forward to staying at the Disney Beach Club. Growing up my Mom had taken us almost every year to the Polynesian Resort, and a few years ago I had gone with an Aunt of mine to the Disney Beach Club. So I knew where I wanted to stay with my own young children when we planned our trip to see Mickey Mouse for their first time. Well we had a seven night stay, we took the magical express and I was slightly annoyed with that, but I thought if that's the worst thing that could happen than, I'll get over it. Boy was I wrong... can you say Norwalk/Norovirus, yeah both my husband and daughter got extremely sick, so from Tuesday - Friday vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, also my ten month old got a touch of it too. And then on Saturday we left at 7am, so most of the trip was ruined. The most troubling thing with the whole Norwalk virus is I found out from the cast coordinator and from the lifeguard at disney BC, that most of the cast members (staff) in rec, housekeeping and DINING services have/had been sick with the same virus. My family and I never left disney property, we had their meal plan, so we eat all of our meals there and my family difinitely picked up the NORWALK VIRUS from DISNEY BEACH CLUB. Hotel staff was calling the illness the flu, but this is not flu. Doctor came to check my daughter and doctor said people refer the illness as the stomach flu. The whole latter half of the week was a nightmare. And in retrospect, from beginning to end several different times through out...vomit was everywhere, at the parks, out at the hotel pool (staff calls it Mickey Poo), over at the Boardwalk (at the Big River restuarant) and of course in our hotel room. Oh when we checked in our bed comforter was dirty, and it looked like there was a period stain on it. Not sure if that's what it was or not. But that was gross. Another thing Disney food is horrible, especially Magic Kingdom. There are a few exceptions to finding some decent food like Animal Kingdom, some places in epcot, and we got really good food at the character buffets, but that is it. Good luck finding good/healthy food especially with small children. Disney prides themselves on celebration...I constantly told them this was my kids first visit. Never got the 1st visit pin. This is small potatoes compared to the virus though. Have a magical day...aghhh, yeah right!!!! One question, why would honeymooners ever want to take their honeymoon there? I can think of a million other places to vacation than listen to screaming children on my honeymoon. One other thing the Dept of Public Health has been notified...So if you get sick please report it. Dept Of Public Health has been told about the virus, they have also been told about the ducks swimming in the pools, which can you say e-coli (nasty). Also there was a county that was just over an hour away from Disney where they has to shut down the schools due to Norwalk virus.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cNice and expensive\u201d", "Author": "mrsfawver", "ReviewID": "UR64628218", "Content": "My family just stayed for the first time at the Beach Club- concierge level.

I really wish that Disney would do some major updates that really would set their rooms apart from off-property competitors. I love staying on property, but unless you stay where a monorail runs, off property (Disney-affiliated) resorts are MUCH less expensive and still have bus transport and magic hours. This makes spending $350+ per night difficult to swallow. They did bring us a pack and play for free-- and this was a wonderful \"extra\". CONCIERGE- We loved the concierge lounge for breakfast and late night snacks/drinks. We really didn't have time to stop in any other time. Top quality everything! I asked for a bottle water and they brought me evian! WOW. We did not use the concierge services, because we have been to Disney so much--we planned ahead. However- we decided these little extras did not compensate for the extra $$ to stay there. STAFF- Everyone was great with the exception of one customer service man. We accidentally arrived 1 day earlier (booked w Expedia and made a mistake) and instead of \"magically\" helping us with a room, he was demeaning and somewhat chastising about my mistake.

On the boardwalk on the opposite side of the lake there's a bakery, candy store, carnival games, restaurants (no reservations required) and outdoor entertainment daily in the form of jugglers and comedians! In front of the hotel there is a beach (no swimming) where they show nightly family movies and roast marshmallows. The bridge on the Boardwalk is a wonderful place to watch the Epcot fireworks everynight! You can walk to Epcot and MGM as well. You need to take a bus to Animal Kingdom and the Magic Kingdom. The pool that is shared by the Yacht Club and Beach Club is fabulous! There's a lazy river, sandy area in the pool for the little ones, a lazy river and a big tube slide from the pirate ship.

Each time we dined at a Disney restaurant, the chef would come out and discuss different menu options for me and prepare a custom meal based on my needs, it was great! The only downsides to this resort were (a) it was expensive (breakfast for three people cost us $80 at Cape May cafe, ouch), (b) you had to pay $10 for internet,which is ridiculous (as everyone else has commented) and, (c) the walls are kind of thin (we could hear the people in the room next door and the people at the tidal pool outside our room door). However, these things were so minor compared to the fun we had and we will definitely go back! I read some reviews before our trip commenting that the decor was outdated and that the carpets needed to be replaced, I did not find that to be the case while we were there - the rooms were great, the carpets were fun with the disney characters on them (our son loved looking at them), and the lobby was bright and welcoming. I found only one grumpy staff member at the dining/recreation counter, and I avoided her as a result.

It was such a fun, family time for us, and we were pleased with our stay at this property. This was his first time to Disney World, and it was well worth the splurge to stay at a Deluxe Resort. If you like luxury hotels and are used to staying in resorts like Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, Preferred Hotels of the World or other hotels known for their service and exceptional rooms then you need to book your stay at WDW Deluxe property with the mind-set that you are paying for as realtors like to say, \" location, location, location\". Being on WDW property with park transportation, having magical express service from the airport, and beautiful grounds and pool areas are the main amenities for this hotel. In my opinion, the rooms are slightly above average, and comfortable with lots of drawer space for families, but don't expect to see a lot of luxury room extras. Other luxury hotels with room charges similiar to the Beach Club Resort come with turndown service, chocolates on the pillows, frette linens, robes and slippers, and plush bathrooms with scales. I think for some of those amenities, you need to pay even more per night and stay on a club level. Overall, we found our room to be inviting with its decor, and the beds comfortable. It was also clean. There were some housekeeping issues that could have been easily resolved if we had pursued it, but we did not bother. We were missing a privacy door sign, and several lightbulbs were out in the room. The one over the vanity, and a light on one of the tables were burned out. We did have to call and get a new remote. Our TV remote was missing. The hotel pool was great. I found dining in the Captain's Grille (adjacent Yacht Club) to be just average. The Character dining at the hotel's Cape May was fun and a trip highlight. The location near Epcot and Hollywood Studios is excellent, however, we did not spend much time there. Instead, we were on a bus to Magic Kingdom a lot. That is to be expected with our son's age, and as a result, when we go back in about four years with him, and our daughter, who will then be four, we will probably stay at a monorail hotel or the Wilderness Lodge which has easier access to the Magic Kingdom. The buses are very efficient, but the Beach Club bus four other hotel stops (Yacht, Dolphin, Swan and the Boardwalk hotel). Also, there is no easy way to get back from the monorail hotels to our resort if the Magic Kingdom closes early and the other parks are also closed which happened to us one night. We ate at the Contemporary after the park closed at 7 pm, and at 9:30 pm, we realized we had no bus ride back unless we went all the way to Downtown Disney then change to another bus that would take us back to our resort. We were on a bus for about an hour and half. We got to bed at midnight!!! We should have taken a taxi, but again, we were paying for free transportation in our room rates. Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay and I would recommend the hotel.....especially for those with older children and for people who want to spend less time at Magic Kingdom.", "Date": "May 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moon Township, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cBeach Club Resort with Dream Makers Vacation - Amazing!\u201d", "Author": "Kanith", "ReviewID": "UR62034727", "Content": "I cannot praise Lynda Hower enough at Dream Makers vacation. This was our family's first trip to Disney. Lynda advised us on every step of the way. She helped us plan and have the best vacation. We stayed at the Beach Club Resort -- which was a beautiful resort with tons of things to do for our children. We were lucky enough to be able to check in upon our arrival around 12:00 noon, which was a pleasant surprise. The room was very clean and located near a pool. The resort had several pools throughout and one immense pool with a pirate ship, water slides, and poolside entertainment; the pool included plenty of shallow areas for youngsters and plenty of room for older children and adults. The resort had a great little market/gift shop which was convenient for grabbing milk, AM coffee, autograph books, and last minute gifts. We ate breakfast at Cape May, a restaurant at the resort. It was a character breakfast with Goofy, Minnie, and Donald. The food was delicious, and the service was fantastic as well. Everyone whom we encountered at the hotel was friendly and helpful and interested in making sure they were meeting our needs. When we checked in and out, we used the Magical Express Service for our luggage and had no worries about dragging luggage from hotel to airport and back. Our luggage was delivered to our room upon our arrival and shipped to the airport from the entrance of Beach Club at our departure. We loved the fact that we could walk out of our room at the Beach Club and walk into the entrance of Epcot in only five minutes. We also enjoyed walking across the bridge to visit the shops and restaurants located at the Boardwalk. Lynda helped us secure some great table service dining including character meals at Chef Mickey\u2019s, Crystal Palace, and even a Princess dinner in Epcot. The food was great and our kids loved meeting the characters in person. Lynda also helped us by giving us some tips for saving money and for making sure we were able to make the most of our 6 days in Disney! I told my husband, considering it was our first trip to Disney, I felt like we were well informed and prepped, thanks to Lynda. When we return to Disney (and I know we will), we will definitely book our trip with Lynda and stay at the Beach Club. We hope to send some of our family and friends there to enjoy as well.

I went into this stay with lower expectations and while I enjoyed the Beach Club more than the Yacht Club, I still can't belive that these at the upper level of Disney resorts. The room itself was fine and almost exactly like the rooms at the Yacht Club in terms of size and layout. It was cleaner than the previous room and did not have a musty smell. Bedding was new and very comfortable. I also like the new Disney-branded toiletries provided. Our room lacked the \"Privacy Please\" sign for the door and recycling bags, even though there were cards in the room asking guests to put all recyclable items in the bags provided. We heard some odd noises at night, but I don't think these were coming from neighboring rooms, rather from outside. It finally dawned on me that the high room rates don't really reflect the quality of the rooms, but the level of service and, perhaps more importantly, the location. Service at the Beach Club was great. Check in and check out processes were fast and efficient. The concierge printed our boarding passes for us the day before our return. Room service breakfast was delivered at the requested times and by very friendly cast members. All of the cast members were friendly and welcoming. It was the location that sold me first on the Yacht Club and this time on the Beach Club. Epcot is my favorite park and since I knew we would be eating most of our meals at Epcot, I wanted to be close. Both the Yacht Club and Beach Club are within very easy walking distance of Epcot, or you can take the boat across the lagoon.

Having been to Disney a few times, I'd recommend having your own car to get the most out of your stay. It'll cut down on travel times considerably, offer you easy access to other resorts (Disney's resort to resort transportation is non-existent), and can be your defacto storage for an extra change of clothes, sunscreen, snacks when you park hop. The best thing about the Beach club is the vast expanse of sand-bottom pools and the water slide (best on the property). But the pool area tends to get extremely crowded with kids, so pretty much a disadvantage if you're going during peak season. Even in the off-season, the pool traffic in the afternoons can get very hectic. And the water slide is nice, but if you're already planning on visiting the water park, it's not really worth dishing out $400 a night for. The bathroom is very, very basic as well.

However, I did have to wait for about 15 minutes for the lone agent to become available. That, however, is pretty much where the positives ended. The Beach Club is unofficially promoted by the staff as the more \"family friendly\" building in the complex. However, I really didn't notice a higher percentage of families there compared to the Yacht Club. Instead, I think \"family friendly\" was just code for \"inferior amenities and decor.\" The carpets are dingy and worn, and the hallways and rooms are extraordinarily spartan. Because the focus is on families, there are surprisingly few rooms with king-sized beds, which means that they were unable to accommodate my room request and I was stuck with two double beds. In the room, the disappointments continued. The high-speed internet is anything but, and chugs along at speeds well below 1 meg, which is disappointing, considering that it is not free. Even worse, there is no option for Wifi, which is absolutely inexcusable in 2010. Heck, it would have been inexcusable in 2007! This is especially problematic, as there is absolutely no option for wireless internet in the conference facilities. Absolutely unbelievable when you're talking $300+ a night. The walls are paper-thin, which makes getting a full night of sleep very difficult. This is made even worse by the fact that the climate controls in the room only appear to have two settings: hot and muggy or just 3 degrees above absolute zero. I found myself getting up multiple times to try and readjust the climate controls, but never found a reasonable setting.

Also, go during the International Food and Wine Festival and you can sample foods and wines from all over the world. Plus, you can spread this out over several nights! Recreation: The pool is amazing. We were able to use it in October, and there were always plenty of lounge chairs. My son loved the pirate-themed water slide and the river and the whirlpools! The one down side is that the pool complex was so big, you can not set up in one area and expect to be able to keep a close eye on your kids, especially if they are only fair swimmers. It gets fairly deep in some areas due to the soft sand bottom, but the crew tries to keep the sand raked and even. If you have kids that are not good swimmers, you need to be in the water with them! There is always something (water volleyball, karaoke, joke contests) going on at the pool! Every night, there is a movie at the beach. The beach is very clean and great for sand castles! There is an arcade, but the other stuff was so great, he never even asked to go in there! You can also take a walk to the Boardwalk, where there are great magicians, plate spinners, and any thing else you can imagine. TIP: You can see the fireworks at Epcot at night if you stand on the bridge that takes you to the Boardwalk. Transportation: Free to and from the airport on Disney's bus. Buses to and from Downtown Disney, Animal Kingdom, and Magic Kingdom. Boat service to and from Epcot and MGM Studios. Walking distance to Epcot. Also, you can walk to the Disney Dolphin or Swan, cross the street, and you are at Fantasia Mini-Golf course.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vernon, Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!\u201d", "Author": "VernonCT", "ReviewID": "UR57111303", "Content": "This was our first stay at the BC - very nice hotel!

A USA Today was left at our door each day. Location is perfect. We were steps outside Epcot's back entrance and a quick boat ride away from Hollywood studios. I personally despise Disney's bus system, so we usually opted to walk through Epcot and take the monorail to Magic Kingdom.

My freind and sister smokes and they didn't like the fact that the balcony had two plastic miny chairs. The resturants where spectactulor and the breakfast was amazing.

The hotel is very attractive. The rooms are tastfully decorated and the beds were extremely comfortable. The vanity area outside the bathroom was set up well with two sinks and mirrors and shelves below for storage. But, the actual bathroom with shower and toilet just seemed very small and crowded. We stayed on the club floor in a garden/standard view room. Our room was a hike from the elevators but we had a decent view. Although we were a couple of floors above a roof the view beyond the roof was pretty good. We could see Spaceship Earth in Epcot so that was pretty nice. I was disappointed with the size of the club floor lounge. It was really small so I usually took my food back to the room to eat. The food was okay. The evening wine seemed inexpensive but again it was alright. I had a discount for this level so I was happy to try it but I don't think it was worth the extra money even for convenience. The ice cream shop, Beaches & Cream is really cute and they had great desserts. It's very small and they get crowded so its probably best to visit at an off time. We ate breakfast at Cape May Character breakfast and it wasn't very good. We ate here last year and it seemed better. We ate at another Disney character breakfast buffet and it was considerably better. There are other restaurants at this hotel but we didn't get an opportunity to try them. One thing that was annoying that if you came back to the hotel at 11:00 p.m. or later it was difficult to get something to drink such as water or pop. There were no machines and the gift store and club lounge was closed. I had to walk to the BC villas in order to get a bottle of water from the machine. I asked someone working there where the nearest vending machine was and this is where I had to go. From that point on, I knew to put drinks in our room refrigerator. As others have stated, the pool area is very nice and we enjoyed the ping pong tables set up outside the ;pool section.

There is also plenty to eat in the gift shop/eatery. We have a 4 year old and 1.5 year old. We LOVED the hotel. It was exactly what we had hoped, and I cannot recommend it enough. We definitely benefited from going during a REALLY slow time; we took the bus to the Magic Kingdom, and were the only ones onboard. The pool is awesome, my 4 year old liked the slide better than anything else we did all week, parks included. The pool area is awesome. The villa was perfect, we needed something like that so we could put the baby to bed and still be able to watch TV or hang out without worrying about waking her. We ordered groceries from Gardengrocer.com and the service was great. Food was there 30 minutes after we arrived. Having a full kitchen was a great luxury, especially being able to have breakfast each day in the room before heading out to the parks. Proximity to Epcot is as close as can be, Hollywood Studios is about 5 minutes by boat. Magic Kingdom was easy. On the last day (11/21) we went to Animal Kingdom, also pretty easy by bus. Some thoughts......Stay away from the ESPN Zone (at Boardwalk) for a meal unless you like really bad food in an absurdly loud atmosphere, or you have to watch a game......Flying Fish was good (at Boardwalk), pricey but nice....Ate at the hotel buffet twice, did the Character Breakfast one morning and it was great, also did the Seafood Buffet and that was great also....if you have a \"princess\" in the group, book a meal in Norway at the castle. It's the only place in all of Disney where you can eat with almost all the princesses, but it books up fast, DON'T wait until you get there.....we ate at 1900 Park at the Grand Floridian and found the food to be poor, though my daughter liked the interaction with Cinderella..... We CANNOT WAIT to go back. If you are hesitating to book something, or are not sure if this is the place, trust me when I say that it's as good as it gets.

The crib provided was a full-size crb, not a pack n play (which is what is most often provided in many hotels). - The lobby smelled so nice. I want my house to smell like that! - The activities team at the pool in the afternoon were great at engaging the kids and getting them involved in games. My son did not want to leave to get ready for dinner, ever. - There's a shallow beach area at the pool (near the Yacht Club) that is perfect for small children. There were even buckets and shovels provided! - The pool slide was a huge hit with my 4-year old. - Housekeeping was great. They always prepared our room while we were not in it (we usually went back to the room for naps in the afternoon). OK - I really expected the pool to be much larger. We're used to vacationing in resorts in the Caribbean and Mexico, and we thought the pool, while not small, was certainly not huge in comparison to a real beach resort. It has different areas, and it's certainly fun, but there wasn't enough sitting during Columbus Day weekend for everyone. And all the chairs are next to each other. - The stairs to climb to the top of the slide were on the beach, not on the pool area. This makes for a dramatic slide, but logistically, you cannot be at the pool and watch your kids go to the slide and up the slide while you sit at the pool or pool area. Just an FYI, in case your children are young and you thought you could just lay at the pool and watch them from there. Not the case! Cons: - Only one: There isn't a good counter-service restaurant. There's a little stand at the Marketplace store, but they don't have any substantial food/seating.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dunblane, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cBeach Club - A great place to stay\u201d", "Author": "dunblane_andersons", "ReviewID": "UR47360158", "Content": "We have just returned from a week long stay at the Disney Beach Club resort and highly recommend it.

We asked for room 2598 (a king room with a woods view) which wasn't available but they provided us with 4592 instead which is also a king with a woods view but as it's higher up you can see the top of the Imagination Pavillion in Epcot from the balcony and more exciting watch the illuminations fireworks (partially through the trees) at 9pm every night. We bought the holiday direct from Disney in the UK on a flight inclusive package and it came with free Disney Dining Plan and also gave a discount on the room and flight too (Saving ~ \u00a3100 / $160 a night all in). I personally wouldn't PAY for the Disney Dining plan as it doesn't suit how we like to eat, but for free - it was a great buy! The room was very nice, hidden mickeys all over the place. Mousekeeping did a good job (encouraged by a small daily tip and little notes to say we liked the towel animals). The balcony was quite large - big enough for 2 to sit out on - but beware that about 50% of the balconies are far smaller and only enough for 1 to stand on. Get the Sehlinger guide to Disney World if you want details. The bathroom was a little dated (not been refurbished like the bedroom) but did the job. I found the cast members generally excellent - especially Art the greeter in his penultimate week on the job :-( the reception staff were very helpful and courteous, as were most of the staff at beach club marketplace, and all at beaches and cream (best burger and milkshake ever!) and Raquel the lovely lady who served us tangerine dreams by the pool :-) The one time we had an issue (with the shower), they dealt with it politely and immediately - and were very friendly to boot! We'd heard loads about the size of the pool and as such was surprised it wasn't bigger! Don't get me wrong, it is a big pool but not ridiculously large. I didn't try the slide but my hubby did and said it was okay - maybe more for the kids! One of the weiredest but nicest things at the Beach Club was the atmosphere when you walked into reception. It was so hot and sticky outside and reception was always gorgeous. Cool temperature and an indescribable aroma in the air that just made it feel...lovely! (I'm not being wet, honest, it's really something else!) We'd not stayed at a Disney Deluxe resort before and there is a marked difference between the experience and room quality here vs. the very nice Port Orleans Riverside (granted there is also a marked difference in price too!). We would definately go back. We were so close to Epcot - it was nearer than the Swan and Dolphin, less than 5 minutes from our room. Wish list time, if they could make improvements... I'd like the Epcot resort 'Friendship' boats to depart from the boat docks near Canada and Mexico in world showcase (that would be COOL) and secondly if they could provide a card reader in the hotel TV so you could view your own and maybe your photopass snaps at leisure, I think that would be wonderful. The resort isn't perfect, nothing is, but we had a very nice time and on many an occasion looked around and said 'Wow, we're actually here'...how many places do you feel like that?", "Date": "October 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "derbyshire", "Title": "\u201cMore than we could have wished for\u201d", "Author": "lreast", "ReviewID": "UR47072274", "Content": "After reading some of the reviews on here, we were a little scepticle about our visit.

It was our first Disney trip, we booked the Beach Club on the recommendation of our friends and in part on some of the reviews on Trip Advisor. We also booked the Beach Club because Diseny had sent me something called a \"PIN Number\" in the mail, it got us a very good deal, so good in fact that I was able to book what I was told would be a room on the 5th floor, entitling us to concierge service, use of what they call the \"Beach Club Planning Staff\" prior to our arrival, and the promise of the use of a breakfast area on the 5th floor (complimentary continental breakfast every day). The planning staff were wonderful, they made all of our dining reservations for us (I just sent them an e-mail 90 days in advance of arrival). Unfortunately, when we checked in, a problem arose. I was given our room keys, told to have a magical day, and immediately noticed that we were in room #3691. Even I can tell that a room with a number like 3691 is probably not on the 5th floor, so I mentioned this. I was told that yes, the room was indeed on the third floor, and yes, we were supposed to be on 5, but it was a suite room, just like the one we would have had on the 5th. I was then told that the \"pool side\" of 5th was closed for renovations. So we go up to the room, it's great, a lovely room with a big balcony, no complaints there (and mercifully no sign of roaches or Palmetto Bugs like in another review). My wife then raises two issues: the first is, if the 5th floor really is closed on the pool side, how come we can see a family with young children standing on a balcony on the 5th floor? The second is about the breakfast that was supposed to be available. When I raised this with the staff, there response was to suggest that I could just \"use all our snack credits on breakfast\" (we were on the dining plan). Not so much as an apology for not even mentioning the relocation of the room. And of course we would have been \"snackless in Orlando\" if Disney had had its way. I kept all our receipts from the market place for breakfast, I intend to write Disney and ask for a partial refund. What bothers me most though is that I had to raise the issue of the room relocation, and I didn't even get so much as a sorry out of Disney over the breakfast thing. As for other features of the Beach Club, the location for Epcot and HS is excellent, but I agree that with the other parks (and especially DownTownDisney) the bus service is so slow to the Beach Club, and with so many stops, that you could probably drive to Tampa in the time it takes to get back to the Hotel. The pool at the Beach Club is wonderful, but it and the hotel were very full and the place is frankly becoming rather run down (it's a little too \"well loved\", especially by families with young children). My kids did, however, think it was the best pool they had ever been too. Would I recommend the Beach Club? Yes, I would, but not at the regular full price Diseny sometimes expects. It is very close now to what I would think of as a \"moderate\" rather than a deluxe, the Caribbean beach is just as nice.", "Date": "August 31, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "nj", "Title": "\u201c50th B-day\u201d", "Author": "TeddyboyNj", "ReviewID": "UR38740761", "Content": "We stayed Beech Cub Resort 7-14 ,the hotel was great .we where by the pool side 1st floor . we had dinner most night at epcot.

First, the employees; Any that we interacted with, from the bellmen, to the concierge, even the staff at the Marketplace, were all pleasant and helpful. Even those we didn't have dealings with offered a polite greeting and smile. The housekeeping was perfect. Other than the carts in the hallway, you'd never know they were around.

Comfortable, warm, refreshing, with sandy bottom and a slide that the kids (and I) couldn't get enough of. Never too crowded, and as others have said, exclusive to Beach Club/Yacht Club guests. The Restaurants: we were not on the dining plan, so grabbed quick stuff at the Marketplace, ice cream at Beaches and Cream( No Kitchen Sink for us, but you gotta see it!!) We had the Character Breakfast on our last morning, and enjoyed it. Crowded, but efficient, with good food and excellent service. Hurricane Hannas was mixed: Boys loved the burgers, girls didn't care for the veggie wrap. The lobby and common areas were meticulously maintained, and immaculate. Room was big enough for 5. Location: Again, a winner. Walked to Epcot several times, took the boat and one time walked to MGM. (hot, but definitely doable); walked over to the Boardwalk as well. Super convenient. Could even see some of the fireworks from the parks from the hotel. Took busses to Dowtown Disney, AK, and Magic Kingdom. Busses were crowded, but we were traveling at peak times, so what do you expect? MK was soooo crowded, we took the monorail to Epcot and walked, and I think it was faster than waiting for the bus! Magic Hours, early and late, are definitely worth taking advantage of. Magical Transportation makes it effortless and stress free going to and from the airport. Did not take advantage of the myriad of kids activities run by the hotel. This really is a destination by itself. For a little bit of a relaxed place, its definitely worth it.

We walked over to Epcot and saw the tribute to U2 band (called 2U)... it was cool ! We had reservations at The Japan Habachi Restauraunt Teppa Edu ! Really very good food and totally entertaining ! The dining plan really worked out great for us !We ate at: The Coral Reef Restaurant in Epcot near The Land area and that was the best food we had. The salad and veggies were grown at Disney hydoponically in green houses) ..And the Mahi-Mahi and Halibut entrees oh so yummy. Lobster Bisque flavorful,velvety, and savory. A Mushroom risotto went with the Halibut and was the best I think I'd ever had! The Yahtsman Steakhouse in the Resort was also very good. The Scallop Appetizer was great ! The Filet was perfect! The Lobster Bisque, divine. And even the kids had steak, potatoes, and carrots ( a nice choice) and their desert was a white chocolate puzzle that came in pieces that they arranged themselves into a Mickey Puzzle. Then, they had a paint brush and could paint the puzzle with edible paint and then eat it ! Hahaha! I got that desert too. And the creme brule was yummy, too. By the way, the vegetarian meals offered at Disney are really good too. We stayed at Magic Kingdom until 2AM !! Cause we were \"Resort People\" Yayayayayayayyyyyy! And at EPCOT till 11PM ! Each night had a different \"late\" night... Cause we were \"Resort People\" Yayayayayayayyyyyy! The toy story 4-D ride had the longest line in the history of my visits to Disney, so my husband and I decided to convince the kids to pick anything they wanted to go back and do in exchange to get the heck out of that long , hot gruelling, line! Guess what they wanted? To go back to the Beach Club to swim! Hahaha! So off we went, they two kids swam and played vollyball, hubby and I hit the hot tub !!!! with a few ice cold imported draft beers from the lovely bar in the resort-- Yay !! A few hours later we boated over to Hollywood again and stood in a line for about 50 minutes and did the Toy Story ride and it was all good. Very cool ride ! Friday, our last day, we had time to pack, check out, swim again and then catch the Magic Express to the airport !", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "bokat", "ReviewID": "UR36596010", "Content": "Great place to stay - our first visit to Disney and the access and amenities were excellent.

We had a wonderful stay at this resort. There is something for everyone: Character dining, swimming, water slide, volleyball, boat rentals, arcade, and movies on the beach. The resort is a destination by itself with EPCOT a short walk away. We walked there three times. Once to get fish and chips from the UK. Transportation to/from parks via the bus, ferry is efficient and runs about every 15 minutes with stops to nearby resorts. Our room was nicely appointed with a small refrigerator, coffee maker, safe, double sinks, daybed, and we had a nice balcony with a partial pool view. Lots of Disney channels. The pool area is staffed with plenty of lifeguards. Beaches and Cream is a quaint restaurant with great burgers and hot dogs. If you have room, order the kitchen sink. Unfortunately, reservations are not accepted, but they're open until midnight. The market place is another quick bite option serving sandwiches, soups, fruit, salads, and a few groceries. There are other dining options at the resort, and I highly recommend that you make reservations. We rented a car for three days and parking is free to hotel guest. While off site, we picked up snacks and water, which cost around $2.50 each at the parks. With tempertures in the 90's, water/snacks for five could add up quickly. So take your backpacks, patience, and expectation that you're not going to be able to see and do everything with four parks, a resort that has everything, and you should have the time of your life.

And we WILL!\u201d", "Author": "mommyoftwo", "ReviewID": "UR36337285", "Content": "We stayed at the Beach Club from July 16-23, 2009. My husband had a conference at the Gaylord Palms, but we decided to stay at the Beach Club after doing much research on hotels in the area, and after reading MUCH info on tripadvisor! And the tripadvisor gang didn't let me down! It was an AMAZING trip! Our very first to Disney World, and definatly not our last! First, some details about our trip: This was our very first Disney experience. We traveled with my two boys, ages 7 and 5, my 7 month old daugther, my hubby and my mother-in-law. We visited every one of the parks, but no water parks. (Didn't need to, the pool at the resort was a waterpark in itself!) Check in- great! We didn't get to the hotel until 10:30, so our group was TIRED. They front desk was corteous, fast, and we were in our room within 15 minutes. We got a roll-away crib for my daughter (delivered within 10 minutes of our request), and the room size was perfect for our group. Motherinlaw slept on the hideabed, boys in one bed and me and hubby in the other. We ordered groceries from gardengrocer.com and after a bit of confusion from the front desk as to where they were delivered to, we had them in our room within an hour of our arrival. Hotel: amazing. Clean, friendly, easy to naviate. We had booked a standard room, but upon arrival requested a quiet room for the baby to sleep during the day and they switched us and upgraded us to a waterfront room with a half-balcony. and this view was AWESOME! Perfect view of the boardwalk and fireworks from Hollywood Studios. We were on the 4th floor, room 4616? I can't remember our exact room number...sorry! We had a couple of concerns about the way we were billed during the week from various places (we had the dining plan and sometimes the snack venues would accidentally charge our ROOM instead of placing the snacks on our dining plan), and a few other concerns, and even though occasionally the front desk personnel would give us different answers to our questions, they would ALWAYS work to remedy our problem to where we were satisfied. That was probably what impressed us the most about our hotel (and Disney in general) was that if you made a request, they always tried to honor it, if they could. one of the bus drivers told us that Disney policy was that if a customer requested something of a cast member, and if the request didn't violate safety standards, then that cast member needed to move Heaven and earth to honor the request. That attitude was obvious to us throughout the week wherever we went! Parks: Had a blast! We took the boys to the parks during the day while my mother in law stayed at the resort with the baby. It was hot, but not unbearably so. We brought our spray fans everywhere and they were lifesavers. More on the parks later, in another review, but if you do have any questions about our park experiences, please feel free to send me a message! location of hotel: Couldn't be better! we visited a few other resorts during our stay and on our next trip, I honestly think we'll stay at the Beach Club again. The walk to Epcot was 3 minutes tops, you take a quick ferry ride to Hollywood Studios, and the buses to Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom and Downtown Disney were always on time and efficient. I think the average bus ride was 20 minutes or so, and the longest we ever waited on a bus was 20 mintues. no issues with any transportation during the week. What was great about the location of the Beach Club was the boardwalk! Sooo much fun! At night we walked around with the kids and ate icecream, watched magicians and rode tandom bikes around. Such a laid-back atmosphere, we lOVED the boardwalk! there is a dance club there, and a comedy club, but we were too busy to visit those. Pool: Water park is a more accurate description! This alone was worth our stay at the Beach Club. My boys LOVED it. Lazy river (that gets DEEP, 8 feet I think), sand-bottom pool, waterslides...they had it all. AND it was heated, so even after rain it never got cold. My baby loved the pool too. This is where my mother in law and baby hung out during the day. Plenty of shade, convenient food, snacks, pool side service, it was wonderful! If you have kids that like water, you cannot go wrong with the Beach club! We all enjoyed this pool so much! Food: we were on the Disney dining plan, and restaruants we experienced were: Ohana, The Flying Fish, Yak and Yetti, Mama Melrose, and Tony's Time Square in Magic Kingdom and a character breakfast at the Cape May cafe...I think more but can't remember the names! No issues with food anywhere. The flying fish was EXCEPTIONAL! our trip was amazing. Any questions, dont' hesitate to ask!

We have a 13 yo boy who loves the more thrilling rides at Epcot (Space, Soaring, Test Track) and Studios (Tower of Terror, Rock N Roller Coaster). We really enjoyed the simplicity of just walking to or from Epcot whenever we wanted - quick trip for shopping, to see fireworks, to grab a bite to eat at one of the international pavilions - super easy and convenient. It's also nice to have the Boardwalk right there so you can visit their many eateries as well. (2) The Pool - we've stayed at 5 other resorts and the pool at Beach Club (Stormalong bay) is without question THE best of all we've seen. It is massive in size, has a great water slide, has a lazy river, and has a sandy bottom. We spent more time than expected in the pool, but it was definitely worthwhile. (3) Atmosphere - great family atmosphere, but not chaotic like some of the moderate or value resorts. They truly have captured the Atlantic Coast feeling and it's really a great place to just hang out. A few lessons for the future we'll try and remember (because we will stay here again): ** We stopped at Target on our way to the resort and bought a case of water - very worthwhile, we saved big $$ on buying water! ** The dining options in late July are not as simple as I had hoped - many places were booked, so next time we'll do what a lot of others do and plan our visits around dining (when we want to visit a particular restaurant that is). ** Beaches & Cream is a great place to have ice cream PLUS they have an awesome burger! ** We stayed on the first floor which was an easier walk to the pool, just around the corner from the Marketplace (shopping plus quick serve food), had a public rest room near by, and wasn't far from the laundry. Will try and do this again next time! ** The boat to Hollywood Studios is convenient - but slow. Need to block out 25 minutes minimum - it stops at Swan/Dolphin plus goes slow to avoid wake. Not a problem - we enjoyed the ride - just need to plan accordingly. ** The surrey bikes at Boardwalk are a lot of fun, but also a lot of work pedaling up the hills - make sure everyone is energetic when you rent the bikes! ** There are two walk-up restaurants on the boardwalk and at 6:00 pm aren't too busy - if you wait later they are.", "Date": "July 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Forney, Texas", "Title": "\u201cLoved the sand on the bottom of the pool!!\u201d", "Author": "ckst1star", "ReviewID": "UR35719765", "Content": "Our first trip to Disney with our 6 year old daughter.

We wish we were back there now! Disney Beach Club Resort is a beautiful resort in a gorgeous setting. The lobby was very pretty and inviting, with a beach sent floating through the air. The employees treated us like we were royalty and made sure every one of our needs was attended to. Our room: We had a wonderful room (2598) that had all refurbished furniture and decor. It also had a gorgeous long balcony with two lawn chairs. We were extremely pleased with our room and would stay at this hotel again without a doubt! The pool area is beautiful and has lots for everyone to do. The pool even has a big waterslide. We especially enjoyed the sand bottom feature. There is definitely plenty of space for adults and children to swim, with even a very shallow pool for very small children. The only restaurant we tried at our resort was Beaches and Cream. This restaurant serves as a location for quick service breakfast. We had a delicious breakfast everyday with choices of pancakes, omelettes, bacon, eggs, yogurt and fruit plus lots of juice and coffee. In the afternoon and evening (until midnight) this restaurant is an ice cream bar/quick service for dinner and lunch. They have delicious ice cream and waffle cones...definitely recommended for a hot day! Transportation to and from the resort was pretty good. This resort is literally a five minute walk from Epcot (walk outside the resort and turn left). You can also walk about 15-20 minutes to Hollywood Studios; however, it was about 40 degrees when we were there so we opted for the boat. There is a boat that goes continuously from Beach Club to Epcot and Hollywood studios. This is a very convenient method of transportation, much quicker than the buses. The buses were on time and provided us with rides to all of the parks within 20 minutes. The only day we had a problem was getting the bus to Typhoon Lagoon. This bus took about 45 minutes-an hour to pick us up heading to the water park and probably took another 45 minutes to pick us up on the way back to the resort. Other than this we had no problems with transportation. There is lots to do around the Beach Club resort. The Boardwalk area features lots of fun shops and restaurants with two bars. It's a also a great place to catch a glimpse of the fireworks at Epcot. It's also really nice to be able to walk over to Epcot to watch the fireworks or check out the pavillons in the evening.

The Beach Club has recently been refurbished, so the hotel has a new feel to it. Lovely rooms with nice furniture and bed linens. The beds are VERY comfortable! The pool is fabulous! It has a fun waterslide for kids and adults and a lazy river. You can rent tubes to float around the river in. Food at the hotel is pretty typical. Not great, but not terrible. We ate at the Cape May Cafe for dinner one night. The buffet was just ok. It did have a lot of variety, so that was nice. Of course, Disney's food is way overpriced, so don't expect too much for the $$ you spend. One nice perk is that you can purchase a mug for around $15 and get as much soda, water, and lemonade as you like for the length of your stay. We ate at Don Shula's at the Dolphin and it was TERRIFIC! Very pricey, but good! The downside to most Disney Hotels is the transportation. It takes at least 30-45 minutes to get anywhere- including to parks and other resorts. Buses and ferries run about every 20 minutes or so, but sometimes it's longer. Then, when you finally get on a bus or ferry, it's standing room only. I think if we vacation at Disney again, we'll definitely rent a car. Perhaps during an off season it isn't as bad, but I can tell you that in July, you'll be standing and waiting and then standing and riding! The Beach club shares transportation with the Yacht Club, the Dolphin, the Swan and the Boardwalk Hotels, so it's very crowded on the transportation. All in all I would say this is an 8 out of a 10!

We stayed in the room overlooking the lagoon and to open the drapes every morning to that beautiful view is unsurpassed. Love it! My boys go crazy at the pool and absolutely love the slide.

We always go for 10 nights- so with that times 5 people, that's a lot of clothes. Grant it I don't pack for 10 nights as I do laundry (bring lots of quarters- you're paying Disney prices to do laundry), but there still isn't enough space to put your clothes away. The only thing I wish they would improve are the restaurants. After a late night at the parks, we would love the option to eat a counter service (we always do the dining plan) which offers pastas, burgers etc. The value resorts have it mastered, with all the dining options. The Beach Club unfortunately does not have that- only Peaches and Cream where it counts as a sit-down meal. The little cafe they have is great for breakfast, but not for thos late night burgers, pastas and pizza.

We were very excited to go and see the room that was just on the second floor which we were told was an 'upgrade'. We open the door to the 'suite' as it was described in the hall only to find that we were upgraded to a KING room with two adults and two children. We went back down to the desk and were given a hard time. We requested a crib for our two year old son but sometimes he won't sleep in the crib so we needed to have a spot on the bed just in case. The front desk person was not very nice about it since we were UPGRADED. She switched our room to two queens on the 4th floor but it was very, very far from the elevator ( you had to walk down two long hallways). This was difficult with the kids but at least it was quiet. The mousekeeping staff was superb, the room was always cleaned early and was immaculate. We never had any 'extra's' like towels made into mickey shapes, etc. but at least it was clean! Always were given fresh soap as well which my kids loved. The hotel has a nice gift shop with a quick service food area and beverage fountains for the Disney refillable mug program. During peak times this area often had very sticky floors and messy counters and soda's that were out....but that is probably common for such a large resort with such a small beverage counter. The food choices here are minimal but at least it is something. Self parking is fairly convenient which is also a plus. Bus service is a short walk from the front entrance and the bus is only shared with immediately located resorts so travel time is kept to a minimum (although we almost always drove to where we were going). One HUGE benefit to this resort is the very short walk to the International Gateway of Epcot and the boat to the Disney Hollywood Studios. The pools are wonderful although a bit of a walk from the guest elevators. There also aren't enough chairs since most people plop down towels on 4-5 chairs only to spend the majority of their time in the pool.

Upon arrivel at the hotel we were welcomed home and taken to the consierge level where we were given all the Disney Information and room keys. The consierge level was well worth it with friendly attentitive staff who helped us with changeing dinner reservations and booking an Aloha Show. Included on this level is continental breakfast with pastries.muffins etc and throughout the day at different times they would lay out snacks and drinks. Would reccomend putting cold drinks in your fridge. All beer and wine aswell as hot and cold drinks all included. I like the fact you could walk to Epcot and take the boat to Hollywood studios it is possible to walk which we did once. The boardwalk is across from the hotel and is a good place to eat and also has a very nice bakery. You can take the boat across but quicker to walk. We ate at the Flying Fish and Spoodles at the Boardwalk and both meals were very enjoyable. We also ate at the Yachtman Steakhouse which was really nice and excellent service. We had a character breakfast which I was disapointed at and felt the characters were rushed even though the breakfast area was quite. Our server was slow and took ages to get butter for the toast. The pool area is amazeing with a beach area and sand bottom, the lazy river was a little disapointing but the pirate slide was fun. They had three hot tubs which my husband enjoyed. Beaches & Cream has nice ice cream and if you can manage th kitchen sink its worth a try!!! Nice food but found it small for such a large hotel. You can order food or have a waiter deliver it your sunbed. There is also a bar. We took the Disney Dining Plan which inc 1 snack 1 counter service meal and 1 table service meal. Although this was ok we did not use all the counter service meals as the large portions were too much for us to eat. It is a good deal for those who can eat large portions. Just a note if you are on the dining plan and book the aloha show you get seated the furthest awayfrom the show if you use the plan. The bus that takes you too Magic Kingdon etc were very reliable and never took too long to get to your destination. We were lucky one morning to be driven to Animal Kingdon the hotel likes to choose a family to make a magical day which for us was magical.

Upon arrival to the resort ( we arrived early that morning) our room naturally was not ready, however we were upgraded at no charge to a lagoon view room that was ready and available ( what a nice treat!)The rooms have been updated and the decor is so mellow and relaxing. You truly felt like you are on a beach vacation. The location is exceptional with only a 3-5 minute walk to epcot or the boardwalk. You are able to take a boat to the boardwalk, Hollywood Studios or Epcot. ( worth it on very hot days) Out of all the Deluxe Disney Resorts, this is by far our favorite. It is so cozy and enjoyable. The Pool is amazing. Truly amazing, with sand islands for the kids to play on, a large pirate ship waterslide, a small baby watersilde, a quiet pool and more. The \"mousekeeping\" was good. Beds were made daily (but at random times) and items refilled as needed. I can't say enough about the service we received at this resort. It was unlike anything we have had before. We arrived tired and cranky after a long car trip and were greeted with such warmth and hospitality our moods changed instantly.

The pool sold us, as we have two boys, ages 5 and 3. Unfortunately, our pool time was cut drastically short since we were in Orlando during \"Epic Rain\" in from May 18-23. However, we still swam a couple times and enjoyed the pool so much that I can't imagine how much fun we would have during normal Florida weather! Highlights: Pool: sand bottoms in areas, sandy \"beaches\" in areas, giving kids a fake beach experience. They don't care - they love to dig weather it's a real beach or not. The big water slide is fun for kids and adults alike. The small water slide appeases the little kids. The shallow bottom area of the pool makes for a fun, low stress pool time for parents. Cleanliness: Our room was very clean each day, even after all our wet and soggy clothes were strewn everywhere around the room. Quick maintenance: The elevator was broken one morning, it was fixed within an hour. Friendly staff: Our oldest lost his first tooth while we were there. My husband went down to the counter to see if they had any special celebration things... they set him up with all kinds of goodies from the \"tooth fairy.\" Location: 7 minute ferry to Hollywood Studios, 7 minute ferry to Epcot (or walk!), 12 minute bus to Magic Kingdom and 15 minute bus to Animal Kingdom. We never had to wait long for a bus, and the walkway to the bus pick up is covered so sheltered from rain and/or sun and heat. Sleeping: Bedding and bed were both comfortable.

We had a difficult time selecting a resort, but the proximity to Epcot and the Boardwalk solidified our choice of the Beach Club. Because it is in the Deluxe category, we expected a lot from this resort - and we were very pleasantly surprised when it surpassed our expectations. We checked in online the night before we left, which ended up working out perfectly. Upon arrival at our hotel (at 11:00 am) we were immediately greeted by a cast member who addressed us by name and walked us to the registration desk. Once we arrived at the desk, they presented us with a folder which included all of the information that we would need for our stay. Plus, we were provided our room key (yes, that early in the morning!!) and proceeded directly to our room. Upon arrival at our room, we realized that they booked us in a double bed room instead of the king room that we requested. A quick phonecall to the front desk resolved the situation and they promptly provided us with new keys to a beautiful king bed room overlooking a quiet courtyard and the Boardwalk. One of the best perks of our room location was that the building we were staying in was literallly a 4 minute walk to Epcot. The guestroom was extremely spacious and very comfortable. The bedding was heavenly - 6 super fluffy down pillows, pillow-top bed, and down comforter with duvet ensured that every night offered the best night's sleep I've had in awhile! There is a ceiling fan in the room as well - which was nice addition. There was a mini-fridge in the room which was good - we had stopped at Target and picked up bottled water (bottles of Dasani cost $2.50 in the parks) so we had cold water to take with us each morning. The bathroom could have been just a little bit larger, but it was comfortable for one person to be getting ready at a time. There are two sinks, the amenities were nice - a clean, aromatic scent to the soaps and shower gel. The towels were plentiful and plush. There was a flat screen tv in the room, as well as Mickey lamps, two desks (one which pulled out from under another for room service trays). There were two closets in the room as well. The only slight complaint that I had about the room was that there were not enough drawers to keep our clothing in...but we made it work with both the closets and drawers. Our balcony was nice, relaxing space to enjoy our morning coffee and afternoon breaks. The room was quiet - even with a family staying next to us, we hardly heard a thing through the wall (it was an adjoining room which typically means you will hear every conversation the other party is having but to our surprise, it was very quiet). Upon returning from the park that afternoon, we had a message on our phone from the Director of the hotel welcoming us to the resort, explaining the myriad of services that were available to us. Even though I know that this recording is provided to all guests, it still made a good impression on me - they really cover every single detail to make sure that your stay is a very pleasant experience. The pool was one of the best things about the resort. Although I have to admit that I was a little disappointed that the lazy river was not consistenly one depth the entire way around (I do not swim and the depths ranged from 4 ft to 8 ft), the fact that the pool floor was covered with sand was a nice touch. The slide looked amazing, however, you will need to travel outside of the immediate pool area to climb the steps to the top. The kids appeared to love it - the adults were just as happy to stay by the pool. We had breakfast with the characters at the Cape May Cafe. Minnie, Donald, and Goofy were the main attraction and they made certain to visit each and every table. The buffet was good - they offered everything from scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, potatoes, fruit, danishes, and even mini-Mickey waffles. The service was nicely paced and they did not rush you out of there (we had an 8:00 am reservation - the line to get in was long, but the wait was short). I would recommend this breakfast if you are staying at the resort, it is worth it. We also had lunch at Beaches and Cream one afternoon. The menu is not extensive, just your basic burger, hot dog, chicken sandwich variety. The food was delicious - however this restaurant tends to get very crowded. Try to visit on an off-hour or you will be waiting about 25 minutes to get in. We visited again one evening for ice cream - again, it was crowded, but it was worth it (personally, I would've rather visited Ghirardelli at the Marketplace instead). There is also a \"Marketplace\" just off of the hotel lobby that offers gift items, food, snacks, beverages, etc. A good option is to purchase the Disney mugs for one price and you get unlimited refills of coffee, tea, soft drinks, lemonade throughout your stay. For $10, I think it is worth it. Plus you can refill the mugs at the Marketplace, Beaches and Cream, Hurricane Hannas, as well as Boardwalk Bakery. This resort has a lot to offer guests. The lobby provides the following: concierge, photopass station, vacation club desk, a photographer on hand to take family photos, atm, and many cast members to greet you upon entering.

We paid for a \"standard room with standard view\" and were upgraded to an excellent room right off of the quiet pool. The hotel/rooms were lovely and clean. The location is great - just a 1-2 minute walk to Epcot, and it's located on a boardwalk that has lots of restaurants, shops, a dance club, other deluxe resorts. The staff is helpful and informative. The main pool \"Stormalong Bay\" has a great waterslide (adults welcome), a tide pool, a lazy river current area, hot tubs, and both shallow and deep areas. The smaller pools (\"quiet pools\") are open 24 hours. Cape May Cafe has a good buffet \"clam bake\" of seafood and non-seafood, and the \"blue glowtini\" is an excellent adult beverage that tastes great and actually glows. The ice cream and burgers at Beaches and Cream are great. The marketplace has lots of breakfast items and snacks (and gift items). I think they serve lunch, too. There is a cozy area near the marketplace called the solarium. It's a great place to eat or relax. You can check your email at the business center located in the Conference Center. Just head into the Yacht Club Resort (which is attached to the Beach Club) and they will direct you to which door to take to exit the Yacht Club and walk to the Conference Center which is a separate building but very close. The downside is that they charge a $6.00 fee for 10 minutes usage. You can get other time increments.

We chose The Beach Club Resort because it was a \"deluxe\" Disney resort and I'm being frank when I say that we certainly had expectations for a Disney Deluxe Resort. We paid a lot of money for a deluxe resort and received less than mediocre service and cleanliness. Yes, we expected more from Disney. I cannot, however, fault the location. It is ideal and we loved being able to just walk over to Epcot for dinner or check out the night life. The boardwalk was a wonderful stroll. We stayed for 18 nights. I'm still wondering why myself, but all I can say is at the time, we kept hoping that Disney would come through. They did not. Even after we left, I was dealing with them in the aftermath. To sum it up, if things are going well with Disney, things are great! However, if any problems arise, you can forget about any epathy or caring from Disney in any shape or form. It's all about the hard cash for them. Once they have your money, you're done for. The ego of many of the staff in that company is beyond belief. I beg to differ that Disney is the 'be all and end all'. We had no hot water for the first three days. I finally REQUESTED to be moved to another room; they did not offer when they couldn't fix the problem. And we were made to feel as though WE were being the imposition. After that, it was a hit and miss as to whether we got even lukewarm water for the duration of our stay. We could not get clean glasses. Even when we asked housekeeping to send us clean ones, we got back a cracked glass or filthy ones. I'm not sure what their idea of clean is, but ours is not receiving glasses with lipstick or mouth prints on them in any form! Nor gunk in the bottom. We finally took some of the glasses to the front desk to show them and asked if they would drink out of them. None of them volunteered! It got better for two days and then reverted right back to the filth. We had some horrible gunk on the wall by our sink and had to ask them to clean it. The bathroom never got cleaned pretty much the whole time we were there. They did not vacuum until we asked them. Even though the pencil shavings from our kids were very visible. We picked up what we could, but expected housekeeping to vacuum the rest. Three days later, we finally asked. Housekeeping slopped coffee on the wall and didn't wipe it until we asked them to. Did I mention the questionable white stuff on the bed skirt that my daughter brought to our attention because 'it smelled horrible'? I won't go any further into that one, except to say it was disgusting. Our fan wasn't working and when Engineering came in to fix it, they could only keep it on one speed and told us we couldn't use the other two. We went through three microwaves because none of them were working properly. Garbage was strewn on the bushes outside our room that had been there for months, if not years. We even found an old airplane boarding pass that belonged to someone from 18 months prior to our stay! And so much for the smoking sections! They allowed adults to smoke right in front of all the children at the children's poolside. When I requested they ask a gentleman to butt out his cigar at the children's pool, the staff told me they couldn't, but that I could either a) ask him politely myself or b) leave. It was the worst experience we've had on any of our travels, let alone the attitude we received in return. We've even had difficulties once before at a hot springs resort (as these things do happen), but how we were treated makes all the difference and we still return again and again to the hot springs resort.

The atomosphere is perfect for us and everyone else we have ever taken. It is very family friendly as well as wonderful for an adults only trip, like there was in October. Look for 'Hidden Mickey's' throughout the resort. Including the easy to find ones in the hallway carpet. We always eat the Cape Mays for the clam bake and Beaches and Cream at least once.

We had never had any experience with Disney (aside from Disneyland) and looked forward to this vacation. We booked via the conference and got great rates. All in all, we had a wonderful time. I will break trip down by category. Check-in: Prior to our trip, I booked transportation via Disney Magical Express. I was curious to see how the whole process would work out. I couldn't imagine not having to pick up our luggage and was skeptical that all would arrive at our hotel. When we disembarked from the plane, I headed over to the counter and was sent directly onto a bus. We waited approx 10 mins and the bus departed. We made 1 stop at the Yacht club and then arrived at the Beach. The trip was uneventful. Checkin was as breeze. They were really friendly and gave pins to our kids. We also had grandparents arriving the following day and they were able to arrange for adjoining rooms under those circumstances. Room: The room was a basic one on the first floor. We liked the little couch that was there. The TV was smaller than expected (prob around 34inch flat screen). We liked having a small fridge and requested a microwave (free of charge). The beds were comfortable and had 2 different pillow options. The room initially had a smoke like odor, but the front desk reassured me that there were no \"smoking rooms\" and it was impossible that the prev occupants smoked. They did offer an air purifier. However, once we aired out the room it was ok. Pool/Restaurants: We really enjoyed the pool. Although the middle section was closed off for repair, we still were able to enjoy the beach area plus the water slide section. My only complaint was that due to the construction, you had to walk around the slide to get to the Hurricane grill. You couldn't access it by crossing to the other side of the pool. There were plenty of lifeguards (in contrast to resorts in Mexico) and we felt safe to have our kids play in the beach water. The boys love the shallowness of the water and had a great time. We ate at the Cape May for breakfast twice. The food was so-so, but the kids loved the characters. Breakfast was $20 per person and that seemed reasonable considering the other cost. There was a Marketplace store that sold everything from cold medicine to frozen dinners. That was good place to buy snacks and things. Service: I really saw the difference in terms of friendliness and service. Anything you need or asked for was properly addressed. We requested adjoining rooms and that was granted, even though the arrival dates were off by 2 days. We asked to extend our stay and that was granted. Concierge could only do so much with dining reservations. Book in advance people! Location: We loved the idea of being able to walk around a lake (be it man made). We liked the close proximity to the Boardwalk and Epcot. For fun, our boys would just ride the boat shuttle around. It was a really peaceful and nice resort. Cost: We came to Disneyworld expecting to spend money. Don't come here hoping to get the best deal. Things do cost more at Disney. You can get a burger at the Hurricane Grill for $7. Sodas cost approx $3 (see tip below). Being able to charge anything and everything to our key card was convenient. just be prepared for the large bill at the end of the stay. Tips: Buy a refillable mug. IT will cost you $13 but will save you a ton. We were able to refill it anywhere in the hotel and at Boardwalk as well. Very very nice. Tip #2, book dining reservations well in advance. Things get booked up pretty fast at the nicer restaurants. Tip #3, if you have some time, tour the Disney Vacation Club. They are really cool and do no pressuring at all. You will learn alot, and if nothing else, will get offered VIP Fastpass to 3 rides. Worth the 90 min presentation I think. Departure: Check out was nice. We received our boarding pass that morning. Luggage was checked in at the hotel. The only thing is that they still require you to get picked up 3 hours in advance. Travel time is 1 hr so you have 2 hour to hang out at the airport. If you can, fly with United Air, because on departure, they don't charge you for luggage (they have contract with Disney).

After many other trips to WDW in the last 13 years, this was our first stay at the Beach Club. We were greeted with the overwhelmingly lovely smell of chocolate and gingerbread from the carasoul horse in the middle of the lobby. YUM! The staff that checked us in and personally escorted us to the concierge level were WONDERFUL! We requested a lagoon view and were not disappointed. The room overlooked the pool and we were able to enjoy the 'changing of the guards' each afternoon that we were 'home'.... changing of the lifeguards that is. :) All the lifeguards gather together and perform a line dance - along with anyone else that wants to participate. It's a really cool thing to watch. Make sure to get an activities list because there are fun things to do all day long. Each evening they offer a Disney movie on the beach. Just pull a lounge chair over to the sandy beach near the HUGE inflatable movie screen, sit back and enjoy! What a neat concept! Back to the room.... we were fortunate enough to get a recently renovated room, with all new decor and a really nice flat-screen TV. The concierge lounge is GREAT! The food offerings, from early in the morning to late in the evening, are really good. The concierge staff are true treasures! They are more than willing to help with any request! A couple evenings we went back to the room early and they provided us with some movies to watch.... free of charge. What a nice touch! Turn-down service with the chocolate mints is nice too. We love the proximity to EPCOT - our favorite park. The boat ride to Hollywood Studios was very relaxing. Of course the pool is the BEST!!! The food options are good also... Cape May Cafe (Clambake buffet for dinner) and the Beaches and Cream ice cream parlor. If you really want to try something unique, ask for the kitchen sink sundae! :) There are only 2 negative things I can say, which happen to apply to all Disney resorts, and I've mentioned it every time I get asked to fill out a survery about my stay on-property... Disney needs to offer free wireless internet and offer more movie channels. When a family can go to almost any other national hotel chain (even the low-cost ones) and surf the internet for free, Disney should definitely do the same! As for the movie channels, it's one thing to have a few channels with Disney shows and infomercials but 10 or 12 channels worth of Disney, Disney XD, Stacy and the Top 10 things to see/do (we do enjoy Stacy though), several devoted to the Disney Vacation Club, Disney hotel information, etc etc etc. Enough already! Give us adults some Showtime, HBO, or Starz or something! That's another option that you'll find at most other hotels. With all of that said, if you're going to stay at WDW please try the Beach Club! You'll be soooooooo glad you did!! :)", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Manitoba", "Title": "\u201cThe Absolute Best Place On Earth!\u201d", "Author": "lhmll", "ReviewID": "UR25223686", "Content": "My family and I (my mom, dad, and little sister) went to the Beach Club as our first Disney World stay.

As soon as we walked in I felt calm and relaxed in the peach and ivory tones of the spacious lobby. The staff was always very prompt and pleasant, and they even gave roses to all the ladies in our party upon arrival. Our rooms had small balconies over looking a lovely flower garden, always very quiet and peaceful. My one complaint about the location was that it required a rather roundabout walk through the lobby to get in and out. But I loved being so close to Epcot and the surrounding resorts. It's very easy to walk to the park or the many other hotel restaurants, plus there's easy boat and bus service to the other Disney areas. My room was of a very standard size and shape, but all of the furnishings were clean and attractive. There's turn-down service in the evening, which is nice, since when I first checked in I felt a bit overwhelmed and confused by the dozens of pillows on our beds. The hotel has some very nice amenities. The highlight is its amazing pool. Sadly, the pool's slide was closed for refurbishment while I was there, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the drifting pool nearby. The bottom of the feature pool is covered in sand, which really was a very novel and fun thing to play in. I saw lots of little kids having a blast building sandcastles on the pool's \"beach.\" There's also a beach by the lake, a very pleasant place to sit and have a drink. The hotel offers a wide variety of special activities as well. Most of them are geared towards kids, such as the evening movies on the beach or making s'mores by a campfire, but adults are welcome to participate as well. There's a pleasant little bar and a couple of restaurants at the resort as well. Beaches & Cream had excellent ice cream and good (though pricey) hamburgers. One morning we tried the character breakfast at the Cape May Cafe, which was wonderful. Lots of hearty, traditional breakfast food and a chance to chat with Minnie, Goofy, and Donald, all dressed up for the beach. Adorable! The biggest drawback to the Beach Club is the steep sticker price. Because I was staying with a castmember, we had a greatly reduced rate. If not for this discount, I'm not sure that I'd feel the cost was worth it, since there are so many more affordable luxury hotels in Orlando.

Did not realize that that the club level/5th floor did not have one bed room suites thus our room was on the 3rd floor. I booked the rooms online thus it was my fault for not calling and getting full information and dealing with a live person. I was also confused by the Disney booking website I expected the one bedroom suite I booked to have a kitchenette, but was told by the concierge that those rooms are only in the villa\u2019s (Next time I will know), but the concierge service is not available in the villas\u2019. We still had use of the club level amenities and service but our room 3501 was as far from the lobby and the elevator as you could get (264 steps to be exact). But our room was the closest room to Epcot as you can get, so you have to take the good with the bad. The room was very nice, though I would not call it outstanding. The bedding was very plush and comfortable. We had turn down service but was not at all what I had read about or expected, maybe because we were not on the 5th floor. The concierge employees were very, very nice and very helpful with any need. They helped change dinner reservation, transportation arrangements to the airport and had any park info we needed this was a big plus not having to wait in line in the lobby. The little refreshment room was much smaller than I expected, but the service and food and snacks available were beyond what I expected. The staff in this room went out of there way to be nice to my 2.5 year old daughter and if we needed a bottled water for the room or a couple of drinks or snacks to take to the room they always were accommodating. The pool was under reconstruction, but the pool at the Yacht Club was open to us and was not any farther of a walk than our pool would have been. The Yacht club pools were very nice with a sand bottom and a big sand dune for kids to play on. There was also a tubing lazy river ride that looked like fun. We went to a character breakfast at the restaurant right in the hotel and the food was great and our daughter loved the characters. The hotel is very clean as you would expect at Disney. The people were friendly and helpful. I would love to stay again but with park tickets and rooms for 6 nights we paid over $600 a day I am not sure it was worth it.

We usually book a villa which we get through an owner but we are treated just like we are the owner. Welcome home is the first thing you hear and I have always found the hotel to be very clean. Now with that said, do the rooms not have normal wear and tear...of course. Lets face it they cant go in every time someone stays and paint. But aside from minor marks on the walls etc its great. Hey to be honest my kids might leave a few marks before we leave. Nothing at Disney is ALWAYS perfect as much as Disney would like it to be. BUT, If I was ever not happy I just told people about my experience. One time we had horrible service at the princess breakfast in Norway. When I spoke to someone about it at guest services to see if they could recomend another breakfast for another time. Not only did they fit us in, we returned that night to have HUGE cupcakes, balloons for the kids and an autographed picture of MICKEY MOUSE HIMSELF!! This past october I did have a run in with a horrible worker at the fireworks in the Magic Kingdom, which resulted in getting my wallet stolen. She should have been fired or picking up the poop behind the horse, but I would not hold Mickey Mouse responsible for her. I did tell them about her in a letter and they did offer us VIP seating for the epcot fireworks on our next trip in a couple weeks. Doesnt give me my wallet back, but what can you do. Thank goe it happend the last night there. This hotel pool is perfect!! We always had reasonable wait times for buses and boats although when we went back this past october and stayed at the boardwalk the wait was WAY TO LONG. Maybe they have cut down on buses because of the economy?? We are actually heading back this month(yes we are going twice in one year) on the 23 of January so I will post again to see if things have changed either for the better or worse.

One week at Disney Beach Club and one week self catering in a 4 bed house outside Orlando. The Disney Beach Club was wonderful, the service and kindness of the staff amazing and the setting - overlooking the lake and with a fabulous pool - is awesome. We enjoyed every minute. We arrived a bit jet lagged after a flight delay and were immediately whisked up to the fifth floor concierge level as an upgrade. The catering staff conjured up a beer for my partner and drinks for the kids before showing us our suite with stunning views across the water and a Christmas tree in the lounge! It took us several days to take it all in. The concierge facilities provide a good continental breakfast with croissants, bagels, muffins etc and later in the day snacks, wine, juices and sodas for the kids. Staff were more than happy to look things up on the internet, book restaurants and were generally on hand for advice with a cheery smile. Mousekeeping left chocolates every day, arranged the children's soft toys in different positions on their pillows every night and someone else (maybe Mickey & Minnie?) left us cards and balloons in our room. The Beach Club is barely 5 mins walk from Epcot (don't bother taking the ferry), 10 mins walk around the lake to the Boardwalk and 10 mins by ferry (jetty right on the beach by the hotel) to Hollywood Studios. Although we were there at Christmas, and therefore fully expected a mad crush, by getting to the parks reasonably early around 9-9.30am we managed to spend a good half a day, get on the rides we wanted to (except Soarin at Epcot which was crammed) and still return to the hotel for a leisurely swim in the late afternoon. We took the Disney bus to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom but didn't have to wait more than 15 mins and there were plenty of seats. We were advised to use our car to go to Downtown Disney as the bus takes a long route picking up from various hotels. It took about 10 minutes to drive. Park advice: 1/ Get to MK early - this is the furthest away and most popular with the most theatrical setting. 2/ Do make time to walk around the World Showcase at Epcot 3/ At Animal Kingdom do the Safari ride, Expedition Everest, Kali River Rapids (wear a poncho or get soaked) and Lion King musical 4/ If you have Star Wars fans try and get them involved with the Jedi Training Academy at Hollywood Studios - one of our got picked and enjoyed a battle with Darth Vader! 5/ Get activity sheets from each park as this tells you times of shows, character meeting locations etc Other thoughts: The world of Disney is delivered on a grand scale. Everything is very spacious and it takes a fair bit of time to get from one place to another. Don't think that park-hopping is an easy option. Get a good map of Orlando and the parks and get some orientation going early on! We've also never seen so many buggies and motorised wheelchairs anywhere - all for hire if necessary. Disney is very 'disabled-friendly'. Word of warning: The US is expensive now for travellers from the UK, for example there was little change from $50 for small hot dogs and drinks for 5 as a snack during the day. The Disney shops sell every type of mouse shaped gift you could ever imagine but for basic Disney T shirts, retailing in parks way over $20, Walmart sells the same around $10. Even without our unexpected upgrade I can recommend the Beach Club for its location and for the pool with its whirlpool, flume, lazy river, hot tubs, it's own crystal-like sandy beach and highly attentive lifeguards.

The most annoying thing was the frequency of transportation. One thing I like about staying at a Disney Resort is the convenience of the transporation system.

The next morning we waited for over 30 minutes for a bus to the Animal Kingdom, we finally gave up and used a taxi. That same evening after waiting 10 minutes for the water taxi to the studios we decided to walk. We did not see ONE boat heading in either direction from the hotel to the park.

We stayed in a junior suite, concierge level, at the Beach Club Resort. The suite provided ample room for me, my husband and our 10-year-old daughter. The room was configured with a master bedroom area, living room area, walk-in closet, and bathroom. The master bedroom and living room are separated by French doors which are covered with sheer curtains. The room was quiet, and we had no noise or traffic issues. Our daughter slept on a daybed in the living room area. The daybed was adequate for her size, but would probably be uncomfortable for a teen. There was a safe, ironing board, and iron in the closet. The bathroom in the junior suite does not have a jacuzzi tub, just a regular tub, which was fine with us. There are two sinks located outside the toilet/bathtub area with storage space provided underneath the sinks. Bathroom amenities include a blow dryer, coffee/tea maker, and toiletries. The toiletries are skin lotion, bath gel, shampoo, and conditioner. We had a very long, narrow verandah with chairs and small side tables. There were lots of drawers, cupboards, and extra space for storage. We were very satisfied with all aspects of our stay at the Beach Club with the exception of the housekeeping department, which was inconsistent. However, any issues that required rectifying were handled promptly and courteously. It's just a shame that we had to request items as basic as toilet paper and tissue when they were not replenished during the daily cleaning. A USA Today newspaper was delivered to our room daily at no extra charge. Laundry/dry cleaning is available via housekeeping, and there is also a laundry facility near the quiet pool area for those who wish to do their own laundry. With the exception of the uneven housekeeping service (which was friendly and cheerful nonetheless), all the resort employees, from the bell staff to the concierge, lobby, restaurant, engineering, and retail staff in the Marketplace shop were all most helpful and welcoming. Most exceptional of all were the concierge staff at the Stone Harbor Club, who handled all arrangements for us during our stay, and did an outstanding job. They are very professional. Available to concierge guests are a continental breakfast in the morning, snacks and beverages throughout the day, wine/beer with hot and cold hors d'oeuvres in the evening, desserts and cordials at night. The NY TImes and Wall Street Journal papers are also available for no extra charge, as are DVDs. There is a children's area in the lounge, with its own seating/TV area. The location of this resort was excellent in terms of easy access to the Boardwalk area, Epcot, Hollywood Studios, the Swan and Dolphin hotel complex, Fantasia mini-golf, and of course, all the restaurants in the Yacht Club/Beach Club complex. We loved Epcot the most of all the parks, so it was wonderful to be able to get there and back again so easily. The setting on the small lake with the white sand beach is lovely, and we enjoyed the services of the marina one evening when we were lucky enough to embark on a cruise to view the Illuminations Fireworks at Epcot. Our daughter loved swimming at both the exotic Stormalong Bay and even the quiet pool complex, which is calm and shallow. There are ping-pong tables at Stormalong Bay, as well as activities in the evening on the beach, such as a camp fire sing-along with s'mores, and a family-friendly movie each evening. I would recommend both the Beach Club and the Yacht Club in terms of activities and amenities for the entire family.

We LOVED it!!!!\u201d", "Author": "irunnoft", "ReviewID": "UR22564020", "Content": "After reading some of the negative reviews on this site, I was a little nervous about our trip to the Beach Club; however, I still had a very high expectation for this resort nonetheless. Those expectations were all exceeded. When we arrived for check-in, I was told that our room was ready. Since it was early in the morning, this was definitely a plus. I had a Standard View room that wound up having a nice garden view with a private patio area. Although the patio area was small, it was still a nice place to sit and have morning coffee and peruse the USA Today. Our room was located very close to the Marketplace, which gave me a sense of trepidation at first. I could only imagine hearing all the noise of the foot traffic of people going to and from the Marketplace at all hours of the night and morning. That just wasn't the case. Even though the room was located near a very busy thoroughfare, it was as quiet as could be. I never heard any noise from other rooms through the walls. The room was very spacious and nicely appointed. We loved the soft pastels and ocean accents. The beds were very large and comfortable. I especially appreciated the thick comforter and the five pillows of varying softness that adorned the beds. There's nothing I hate more than a pancake for a pillow - and a shapeless, formless one at that. Not so at the Beach Club. The pillows were thick and maintained their shape nicely. Some were firmer than others which offered a nice selection. The bathroom was beautifully tiled and boasted a nice shower head that not only looked cool, but also put out the water pressure! The double sink at the bathroom counter is always a plus! Our room also had a flat panel LG LCD TV hung on the wall inside a wooden frame. It was very chic, but yet still within the theming for the resort. Speaking of wood, the furniture in this room was extremely nice. The Mickey in the lifeguard tower lamp was a cute touch. All in all, the room was VERY nice. We did have a few issues with our room that were quickly rectified by engineering. We had two lightbulbs that burned out over the sink. The same one burned out twice. Both times I called, somebody was out to fix it in less than ten minutes. We also had a problem with an outlet. Again, in a matter of minutes from placing a call, somebody was there to fix that. As it turns out, the resort hairdryer was the culprit and a new one was installed. Even though a few minor things happened, the staff were very quick and attentive. The only area where I felt the staff dropped the ball was with mousekeeping. I requested to have our room made up early in the day so as to allow us to come back during the afternoon and rest and relax. My room was never made up before three in the afternoon. The thing that irked me just a bit with this was that I called housekeeping three times to request this on three separate days. After the third call to housekeeping being ineffective, I approached the front desk and spoke to somebody at concierge. He assured me he would call them personally. I thought that would have taken care of it, but sadly, it didn't. We never had our room made up early like I requested. After the fourth try didn't net any results, we just resigned it to be so for the rest of our stay and planned accordingly. I will say this, mousekeeping did an outstanding job each time they cleaned the room. It was always thoroughly cleaned and we never felt like they did a poor job. We never received any towel animals beyond the requisite mickey ears that are now left on the bed for the first day you check in. Even though I tipped every day, that made no difference with regards to towel animals or critters. However, as long as the room was being taken care of well, I didn't really care. I know my son always loved getting those little surprises. He was the only reason I would care about that being done at all. Stormalong Bay is the best pool in WDW. The sand bottom was awesome! We all loved the sheer diversity of fun and recreation the pool offered. We also loved the movies under the stars down on the beach. Beaches and Cream is VERY good and very crowded. You really have to wait just to get in, but if you are patient, it's one of the best burgers on WDW property (that is if you like good old fashioned fried burgers). Finally, NOTHING beats walking into and out of EPCOT - especially after seeing the fireworks. It was just a short five minute walk into EPCOT. The boat transportation to Hollywood Studios was quite another story. We took the boat once. It was already crowded with people (it started out at the Boardwalk). When we embarked, the already crowded boat then stopped at the Swan and Dolphin resort to take on more people. It was a very slow and crowded trip. After that we opted to drive to Hollywood Studios. Speaking of opting to drive, we also waited over 20 minutes for a bus to take us to the Animal Kingdom. After getting tired of standing around in the cold (it was in the upper 30's that day), I decided to return to my room and get the car keys. From that point on, we drove everywhere. The only real downfall for this resort is the same one shared by the Swan, Dolphin and Boardwalk - transportation. The buses are shared between the Boardwalk, the Swan, the Dolphin, the Yacht and the Beach club. That means that the buses stop five times before getting to any theme park. They also hit those stops on the return journey. That makes things tough when you're trying to get somewhere for an ADR or a park opening. We never had an issue with driving and that kept things less stressful than having to deal with the bus situation. Even though the parks weren't at their busiest, the transportation situation was still less than desirable. All in all, the Beach Club has become our new favorite resort. The sand bottomed pool is fantastic. There was always something going on for the kids down by the pool. The resort was staffed with some very friendly and helpful people. We especially loved talking to Art the Greeter! His fame is well-deserved! He's an icon at the resort for good reason.

I could hear their alarm clock go off. I could hear kids crying from down the hall. Be sure to bring ear plugs because I did not get any sleep. Then when we went down to the marketplace, it was a zoo, no organization at all. It took me 45 mins to get a cup of coffee. Highly irritated and will not be staying again. Only 3 people in the entire place was pleasant and I must have seen about 50 employees. The only thing I liked was the decor was cute and well put together. I wouldn't complain about a long walk because it is a larger hotel so that could happen.

We spent 5 nights at the Beach Club. Our overall experience was wonderfull but its not as nice as the Grand Floridian. We visit Disney once a year and stay and the Grand Floridian however this time we decided to stay at the Beach Club which is also considered to be a high end Disney resort. The resort seemed cramped and crowded. The lobby is small the we had to wait 15 mins to check in. After checking in we had to walk another 10 mins to find our room, unlike the Grand Floridian where you are escorted to your room. The rooms are not very big and the bathroom is small. It does feel cramped for a family of 4 especially with all the luggage strollers etc... This resort has a mega pool which is shared with the Yacht Club resort next door. The pool is very nice, the kids loved it but since it is shared it was very crowded and was hard to find a chairs. The poolside service is very very slow. The room service was excellent howver we did have to wait about 45 mins to an hour for our orders. I would not have minded the delay but its hard when you have little kids who get impatient. The resort is close to MGM and Epcot, both are walking distance, the Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom takes 20-30 mins mins via the Disney Bus. The bus stops at 3 other resorts before you get to the parks, this is very annoying and the bus gets very crowded. Disney recommends that you make dinner reservations every night you are there, but this is difficult to do with young kids who have been at the parks all day and the difficulty of timing your return since you have to rely on the busses. All restaruants had aleast a 60 min wait, thus we stuck to room service. The room service menu is very very limited, i guess they want you to wait in line at the restaraunts.

It was clean and smelled clean. Since the hotel was busy you would think that it would accomodate with increased staffing at the pool bar. Lines were long. The snack bar closed at 8 and you couldnt find any food except in the marketplace inside. The life guards were great.

We had been a week without power due to Hurricane Ike. I don't know if I was just happy to be somewhere with working lights and AC, but the Beach Club resort was amazing. I had booked the standard room. Our room was larger than I expected with a nice little balcony. There was a partial view of the lake and Boardwalk from our room (see the photo). The room was clean when we arrived and mousekeeping staff did a fantastic job cleaning the rrom everyday of our stay. Nice little touch with a Mickey shaped towel on the bed when we arrived. All of the staff that I encounted during my stay was informative and very Disney-like with excitement. The Stormalong Bay pool is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The sand bottom pool was great for my 3 year old who could easily stand and walk across the pool on his own. He is totally obsessed with pirates and was thrilled with the Pirate Ship slide. The other great benefit to the Boardwalk hotels is the location. It was a 5 minute walk to epcot and a boat ride to Hollywood Studios. The boat was a problem after the Fantasmic show was over. The line was really long. We opted to walk back to the hotel which was about 15 minutes. The Magic Express transportation to and from the airport was easy. However, they tell you that your luggage should arrive within 3 hours, but it was more like 6 hours! I made sure to pack our swimsuits in a carry-on so we could enjoy the pool that day we arrived. The only negative to our stay was that there was a water leak in our room on the second day of our stay. The carpet near the bathroom was soaked. The front desk gave us an upgraded room on the same floor when we were required to change rooms. But they were very nice about the situation and sent someone to help us move our luggage.

My first impression of the resort was absolutely beautiful. From the moment we stepped off the Magical Express bus, it was as if we had stepped back in time to a New England beach resort, complete with sandy beach and washed up pirate shipwreck\u2026which we later discovered was the pool slide! We were instantly greeted by a very courteous cast member who took our name, gave us a quick tour of the lobby \u2013 including the cartoon area where the kids could wait while we were checked in. Check in was very quick and they even noticed that it my older son\u2019s birthday was coming up and gave him a \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d button (which he proudly wore the whole week). The concierge took our carry on bags that we had in tow and we were off to Epcot! [With Magical Express, you are sent special luggage tags prior to your trip. Then you check your luggage at your home airport and it is delivered to your room at your Walt Disney World Resort. There is no waiting at baggage claim. If you are traveling with children, the complimentary service will be a highlight of your trip!] Location The Beach Club Resort is one of the Epcot resorts at Walt Disney World. It is connected to the Yacht Club and is across the lagoon from The Boardwalk Inn. It is located within walking distance to the World Showcase entrance to Epcot. This alone is one of the greatest perks of this resort! It\u2019s a real treat to be walking back to your resort with the Illuminations Fireworks bursting over you and reflecting in the lagoon. The Beach Club is considered a Deluxe Resort in Disney\u2019s categories. The resort also has the Beach Club Villas, which are in the Deluxe Villa Resort category. Cast Members If you are familiar with Disney, you know that all of the individuals who work there are called Cast Members. The most famous cast member at the Beach Club is Art the Greeter. He is the most pleasant person you will ever meet and greets every guest with a joyous welcome! (picture) Rooms There are two parts to the Beach Club Resort and the Beach Club and the Beach Club Villas. We stayed in a Standard View Studio that overlooked the smaller, \u201cquiet\u201d pool. The room was beautifully decorated in soft beach tones and had a queen bed and a sleeper sofa. It also had a mini-kitchen with a refrigerator, microwave, toaster, small sink and kitchen necessities. There was a large vanity area and a separate room with the toilet and shower. The extra space in the studio, which is slightly larger than the standard hotel room, was a real benefit. Our first floor room had a small patio that led right to the walkway to the quiet pool, which we enjoyed several times! Pool Another highlight of staying at the Beach Club and Yacht Club is admission to Stormalong Bay. Stormalong Bay is the largest sand bottomed pool in the world. The bottom of the pool is layered with wonderful, soft sand that is brought in from Arizona! The water complex includes a lazy river, with a gentle current that allows you swim along. Water tubes can be rented at an extra charge. There is a zero entry area with a sand beach that never gets deeper than a couple feet for the younger members. There are several hot tubs tucked away in the rocks surround the pool. There is even a current pool, where you can go around and around in a small area pushed along by the current. By far, the most amazing part of Stormalong Bay is the Pirate Slide. (picture). To enter the slide, you actually leave the pool area and take a quick walk across the walkway leading to Epcot. This two minute walk leads you the steps of the pirate ship. Once you climb the first set of steps, you will discover another small, shallow pool, complete with a small slide for the younger adventurers in the family. For those who are a little more adventurous, you begin the climb up another staircase, to a spiral staircase that takes you to the top of the Pirate Ship\u2019s lookout. This is the top of the slide. You start by going through a long enclosed tube that shoots you right over top of that walkway you just crossed and then come out only to wind your way through the shipwreck and the \u201chavoc\u201d of rocks it created on the \u201cbeach\u201d. It is a really cool slide! When entering the Stormalong Bay area you will be asked to show your room key and be given a wristband. This pool is very popular and the cast members do a great job at making sure that it is enjoyed by the guests who are staying at the Beach and Yacht clubs. Water Sports The Beach Club Resort is located on a lake that connects Epcot with the Epcot Resorts and then Hollywood Studios. Just out in front of the Yacht Club is Bayside Marina, a water craft rental station. There you can rent a pontoon boat, canopy boat or even a Mercury Water Mouse or book a specialty cruise! Dining There are many dining options located both in the Beach Club resort, the Yacht Club, the Boardwalk Inn and the boardwalk area outside it and of course Epcot is just minutes away. One of the most famous eateries at the Beach Club is a small soda shop, called Beaches and Cream. (picture) Known for its sandwiches and burgers, but mostly for its AMAZING ice cream concoctions, seats are in high demand! We had a 45 minute wait one evening, but it proved to be well worth it. [It doesn\u2019t hurt that the Lafferty Place Arcade is right next door. There were lots of parents enjoying quiet conversation while waiting for Beaches and Cream tables while the kids were having a blast in the Arcade!] The d\u00e9cor of the shop is everything you would expect from a soda shop done right: gleaming counter top, small tables, smiling servers and shiny glasses just waiting to be filled with yummy ice cream. We all ordered large sundaes and they were fantastic. I had a \u201cNo Way Jose\u201d that was chocolate ice cream with peanut butter sauce, hot fudge, chocolate chunks and lots of whipped cream! We even got to witness several families ordering what is called the \u201ckitchen sink\u201d. It actually comes in a small sink. It has a mound of ice cream scoops, loads of toppings, whipped cream, sprinkles, sauces and cherries\u2026and as many spoons as you need. Other restaurants at the Beach Club include: Beach Club Grill \u2013 Clam Bake/Seafood buffet at night, Character Breakfast Buffet in the morning, located just off the main Beach Club Lobby Hurricane Hannah\u2019s \u2013 Burgers and Sandwiches located by the pool Marketplace \u2013 small snack items, made to order breakfast sandwiches (my husband thought these were great), made to order granola parfaits (which were delicious and my personal favorite) and various other staples. Located in the lobby Room Service is available to all resort rooms. There are several excellent dining choices at the Yacht Club as well, but more about that in my next review! Sandcastle Club Disney is a great place for families, there is no doubt! However, there are times in every family vacation, where everyone (read..parents and kids) could use a little space! We decided to check out the Sandcastle Club for our two boys for an evening. We checked them in at 6 pm., upon which we were introduced to all of the cast members who would be supervising the children that evening. The Club area looked like something out of every kid\u2019s biggest dream. There was one whole wall of arcade games and gaming systems \u2013 with very appropriate games, I might add! The far wall was full of toys, puzzles, board games and fun looking things. There was an art station full of craft supplies. There was a movie room (fully lit) that had the Lion King playing and lots of bean bags. Finally there was an eating area off to the side with a hand washing sink. We were given a menu from which the kids could order dinner and pick the time it would be served. My guys thought that was really great. We then complete a form with our cell phone numbers, where we planned to go, what time we expected to be back and if there was anything else we thought they needed to know about our kids to make sure they had a great time. Finally we were handed a pager that would be used if one of boys needed us and told to have a great evening. When we came back several hours later, the boys asked if they could come back every night. The cost is $11 per hour, per child and includes dinner for the children! Transportation Transportation to all the Disney Parks is available through buses and watercraft. To travel to Epcot or Hollywood Studios we had the option of walking or taking one of the Friendship Boats to each of the parks. Bus transportation to all of the other parks, including water parks and Downtown Disney, was available at the front of the resort. Our wait times were never long and there was always a cast member there to monitor lines and make sure the right busses were on their way! A Couple of Other Things\u2026 There is a great workout facility called Ship Shape Health club, located close to Stormalong Bay. Overall Recommendation I have stayed at many Walt Disney Resorts and this ranks among my favorites. The cast members were very friendly and ready to help at a moments notice. I should note that we were there during Tropical Storm Faye. I was incredibly impressed by the level of communication we received about operational changes and emergency information. While there were no major alterations, other than Illuminations being cancelled one evening, we received several voice mails with park hour changes and offers of assistance if we encountered any problems due to weather.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cFirst time at BC\u201d", "Author": "disneyO8", "ReviewID": "UR20291575", "Content": "We stayed at the BC for the first time in August.

We love Disney and have been to Disney World five times in the last five years. The Beach Club has always been our favorite resort and that fact remains unchanged after this trip. We actually split our week's stay between the Polynesian and the Beach Club. We honeymooned in the Hawaiian islands, so we thought we'd give the Polynesian a try to re-create our honeymoon trip. A bit of background about us: we are a young professional couple with no children that travels frequently. Epcot is our favorite Disney park, so the Beach Club is the most convenient resort for us. The International Gateway of the World Showcase in Epcot is literally steps from this resort. First and foremost, I must say that I completely disagree with other reviewers that say the Polynesian is better than the Beach Club! Please see my separate review of the Polynesian. Everyone has different preferences, but the Polynesian was not for us. We were actually happy to check out and move into the Beach Club! We felt like we came \"home\". For our anniversary, the Beach Club upgraded us to a club level room. The rooms were beautiful and we were on a private floor which was much quieter than the rest of the resort. The room was light, newly renovated, and had nice Disney touches. The bed linens were a nice upgrade from the last time we stayed in this resort (December 2007). We had a full balcony with a nice view of the pool and lake with a set of chairs and table. We enjoyed breakfast on our balcony every day and loved it. Upon check-in when we learned about the upgrade, we were escorted to our room by a cast member and told about all the priviledges of the club level. It was a nice touch! We also stayed in the club building at the Poly and received no escort; we were left to find the building on our own. I have many more examples of the quality of service being better at the Beach Club than the Polynesian...too many to list! One other example is our packages bought in the theme parks were picked up by the concierges at the Beach Club and placed in our room. It was so nice to come back after a long day and have our packages waiting for us in our room! At the Polynesian, we had to pick them up ourselves (and walk to a different building, mind you). The clientele was more our style at the Beach Club: couples, families with well-behaved children, and just more respectful people. We had no issues at all. The selection of food and drinks in the club lounge was better at the Beach Club than the Poly. We appreciated the location of the Beach Club better, as we prefer Epcot and Hollywood Studios over the Magic Kingdom. The pool is also very large and warm at the Beach/Yacht Club and we saw many people enjoying it. Everyone in the Disney parks, restaurants, and the Beach Club went out of their way to make our anniversary trip special. We will never forget all the great memories from this trip. We love everything about the Beach Club and will be back in December when we vacation with my in-laws. Don't let the negative reviews scare you: this is a fabulous resort!

I have been to Disney many times, but this was our second family vacation with our children. I have stayed in moderate and deluxe resorts. Last year we stayed at the Polynesian. The Beach Club was what I expected, typical Disney property...not luxurious by any means, but met our needs very well. The staff was excellent. Very service oriented, friendly, and helpful. In my opinion, Deluxe at Disney means you have more amenities and you are more conveniently located. We wanted something that didn't require us to wait in long bus lines, and the Beach Club was very convenient to Epcot and Hollywood Studios. We must have gotten one of the older rooms, because ours smelled musty and the bedding etc was clearly worn. Since we don't spend a ton of time in the room, I didn't really care. The pool was fun..but frankly some of the pool reviews I have read are bit overrated. It isn't exactly a substitute for one of the water parks. But if you plan to take an afternoon out of the parks to relax, this pool is great. My kids, 3 and 4, really enjoyed the kiddie sized waterslide, and the sandy, graduated, 2-foot pool areas since they don't swim. Cape May offered a great character breakfast with Goofy, Minnie, and Chip & Dale. Similar buffet as the Crystal Palace, and so convenient if you are staying right in the hotel. We were on the Disney Dining plan and were a bit disappointed with the Quick Service meals available at the Beach Club. Seemed to me the Polynesian had more choices of Quick Service foods. We definitely plan on returning again to Disney, but will probably book the Poly again over the Beach Club. Given the money, and the ages of my kids, the Poly is just much more convenient to where they want to go...the Magic Kingdom.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado Springs, CO", "Title": "\u201cOne of Disney World's Best Hotels\u201d", "Author": "Westcliffe6", "ReviewID": "UR19890641", "Content": "We just got back from a 4 night stay at the Disney World Beach Club in Orlando.

I called the week before and requested a refurbished room as I'd heard the older rooms were starting to look worn. I was granted the new room upon arrival with no problem. It was not ready yet at 8 a.m. so they held our luggage and we hit the parks for the day. Upon returning at night, the room was like a sanctuary. Fresh paint and carpet, well-appointed, separate shower/vanity area, and a daybed that was perfect for one of the kids. It was cleaned very well every day, and one day the housekeeper forgot to leave a bath mat, so I went out to get one from her cart, and she was so upset, we had 8 bath mats and far too many towels in the bath every day from there on. Stormalong Bay was fun when we had time to hit it after the parks closed. The Marketplace was fine for breakfast - we eat on the go so we weren't looking for a sit down meal. Never any lines at 7 a.m., easy to bring the tray back up to the room to eat. Was never back there at lunchtime to comment. Tried to eat at Beaches and Cream on our last day out but the wait for lunch was 45 minutes. Ate elsewhere on the Boardwalk. In the evenings the line was out the door there for ice cream and they closed at 11. Got ice cream late-night at the Marketplace with no line and it was fine. Best thing about BC is the easy proximity to Epcot and Hollywood Studios. You can walk easily to both - I would never take the boat to Hollywood, we can walk faster than it can drive. Extremely convenient as we spend most of our time in Epcot and always end the night there. Best of all, we had a Bounceback offer waiting in our room so we were able to book the BC for our Food and Wine Festival trip in October at a discounted rate. I highly recommend this hotel - it definitely had Deluxe amenities similar to Polynesian. I would just say to always look for a discount of some sort so you don't have to pay Deluxe prices. I used an Annual Passholder discount for this trip.

For $300 plus a night - I would expect enough towels for our party of 5 (no) the day bed to be made up daily (no) upgraded amenities (plasma? refridge that works? micro?) clean windows (no) and no construction - or at least a notice telling us that construction and workers would be on the grounds during our stay.

If you are visiting Disney...and have extra funds to enjoy a Deluxe room and a \"Pool Day\"...then book The Beach Club. The Beach Club boasts the most wonderful pool I will ever see in my lifetime including a whirlpool, sandy bottom, fantastic water slide, baby water slide, volleyball area, waterfalls, spa's, young child area, beach area, etc. This is why we booked The Beach Club for 3 years running. This year, We booked 2 standard adjoining rooms for our family of Dad, Mom, and 3 teens. All the rooms I have stayed in (all 3 times) have a Daybed in the room (sleeps 5) , but the kids have outgrown it and we need the extra bathroom. We have always been provided a refrigerator and microwave. Did not receive the microwave this time initially but requested it and received it within 3 hours the second day we were there. Our Standard rooms had a nice balcony and view from the back and a quick walk (2nd floor - down the stairs) to everything on the first floor. There is a convenience type store/gift shop called the Marketplace which offers grocery items and \"Counter Service\" and \"snacks\" on the Disney DIning Plan. The Roast Beef at the Marketplace was excellent...they can substitute the \"Brie\" cheese for Cheddar from the salad bar. The Rooms were comfortable and beds had plenty of pillows. They offered the new Disney Shampoo, Conditioner, lotion, plenty of soap. There is a Coffee maker, Ironing board, iron in the room and you get a USA Today newspaper most days. Room service is available until about 11:00pm. We ordered Pizza from Domino's one night ....expect one pizza to be about $20. You will get a wristband at the pool with your room card. Towels at the pool are plentiful with your wristband. On property: Hurricane Hanna's Grill: Kids Loved the Hamburgers....We loved the Chicken Flatbread with hummus. If you are on the DIning plan and ask to pick up your icecream later..you need to get it the same day. Cape May Cafe Buffet: Get your reservations 90 days in advance. We always love the Buffet which includes Seafood plus Roast, RIbs, Chicken Nuggets, a great Salad Buffet and wonderful dessert buffet but will probably try something else next time....was just so crowded. The Arcade and Spa were superior to other DIsney Resorts we have seen. Walk out the back of the Resort to the Beach and turn left...and walk 10 minutes to Epcot!

A little Epcot advice here: Akershus Princess dinner at Epcot was expensive but relatively good with the princesses as entertainment for the kids and the portions & appetizer buffet were decent. Another good option is the German sit down buffet in Germany (at Epcot, as well). You get a great show and lots to eat. I won't say that it's a 100% German (chicken strips versus real Putenschnitzel [turkey schnitzel]).

A few things we LOVED! Pools - The pools are all perfect tempurature. They all have sand bottoms which is something differnt and cool. There is a really cool slide and there is also a small pool by the access to the big slide so if you have big kids that want to be on the slide you can hang out at the access area with your younger ones and they can go down the little slide. My 3 yr old loved it back there while her big brother (6yrs. old) enjoyed the bigger slide. (dad enjoyed it as well). There is also a beach area, it's actually the pool with a little beach built into it, this is where my 3 yr. old wanted to spent the entire trip. Rooms - We stayed in a standard room which was nice, a little on the small side. Once the kids were ready and dad and I needed to get ready the kids had very little room to play - they kinda went crazy. I think larger room would have been a great idea. The standard rooms all have balconies/patios (ours did) this was nice. We spent mornings out there having coffe etc. while the kids watched cartoons. Resturants - We weren't really pleased with the food situation it was nearly impossible to get reservations, although we did book our trip at the last minute. Dinner reservations were the hardest - we mostly ate room service for dinner (which was all good). Breakfast wasn't to bad we were able to do character breakfasts on 3 occasions I think, maybe 4. We also did a lunch with the princesses at Epcot which the girls LOVED!!! The ferry boat was nice to have there as well. We rode to MGM/Hollywood for that, and we also toke random rides, the kids enjoyed that. Don't bother getting on the boat to go to Epcot it is literally a 3 min. walk. The boardwalk is right across from the resort which was alot of fun, nice resturants, shopping, etc. Great vacation, would HIGHLY recommend this resort.", "Date": "April 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontario", "Title": "\u201cFabulous stay!!\u201d", "Author": "JKobr", "ReviewID": "UR14689450", "Content": "My wife, I and our two boys (aged 6 and 1) stayed at the Beach Club for three nights from March 13-16 as the front end of Disney's Land/Sea 7 night vacation cruise package.

The grounds are amazing, clean and picturesque whether strolling around the hotel, using the pool, along the boardwalk or the beach. Our check in was effortless, but can't say the same about our luggage which was being transferred over from our previous two day stay across the lake at the Boardwalk Inn. While told it would arrive around 4pm while were at the parks, upon our midnight return to the hotel, had to call Bell Captain again to get it up to our room. It also took 4 phone calls to the Bell Captain over the span of two days to get a package we had delivered, up to our room. Luckily our need for said package wasn't urgent so didn't cast a bad cloud on our stay. The room was excellent, large and clean, good size bathroom, and ample space to accommodate the crib for our one year old and the day bed for my 6 year old. Turn down service was nice, and my son enjoyed the staff leaving chocolates behind each night. The hotel pool, Stormalong Bay, is as great as advertised. Sand bottom zero entry pool was fantastic for both kids & adults, spacious and warm. The pirate slide was a great thrill, as was the mini lazy river and whirlpool. Staying here just for the pool is reason enough. We only ate at the resort one night, and it was both delicious and plentiful at the Cape May Buffet.

A section on the level that had free snacks(little sandwiches,pretzels,chips and dip,beverages,etc.) and breakfast(bagels,cereal,coffee,krispy creme donuts yumm!) Lobby: The resort's lobby was okay.Nothing extrodinary but nice. Pool: The pool was amazing!!! It had a sandbottom pool so it was like hanging out at the beach and a regular pool. It also had a really cool slide.The ducks like dto swim in it alot so don't be suprised! Beach: The resort had a little beach right by the lake that connected it to the boardwalk, dolphin,epcot, etc. one down side is that you couldn't swim in it, but i guess thats because alot of boats go through it. At night the beach club has movies on the beach with a big blow up screen. I didn't try it but it looked fun! also has yoga on the beach in the morning. Rooms: The rooms were great, better then I expected.It had a beachy theme. We had a nice Large balcony in our room.Comfortable beds and very clean.We even had an i-home in our room. Dining: The beach club only had two restaurants.Cape May Cafe. We ate breakfast there one day. The food was only okay.But the characters were cool. Minnie,chip,dale,etc. all walked around greeting everyone. The resort also has an old fashion ice cream place called beaches and cream.It had huge sundaes,burgers,fries all the normal american food. Right next to there is the arcade(had a good time in there!).We also ate at the yachtman steakhouse located at the yachtclub resort(A little more up scale then beachclub i thought) next door. All I can say is EXPENSIVE. Location: The last thing about the beach club is that it is in great location to epcot. a five minute walk!

Dislikes: - The rooms are really starting to show their age. They are in need of a refurb. (fading wallpaper, ceilings need a fresh coat of paint, shower could use a good bleaching). - The \"mousekeeping\" service was sub-par the first night (sock left in a drawer from previous guest, had to call down twice for a crib, when the crib did arrive the crib sheet was heavily soiled.) - Balcony was too small to sit out at (the balconies were much larger at the Yacht Club). All in all it was an above average stay for us and the pluses definitely outweighed the minuses. The mousekeeping was fine the rest of the stay.

Mo mom and I went on a girls' week out trip to Disney and we just LOVED the Beach Club. The hotel is beautiful. The lobby is gorgeous. The rooms are beautifully furnished, cheerful, and have these amazing beds that lull you to sleep after a hard day at the parks. You don't need to pay extra for the pool view- the garden views are very pretty. They have the most friendly, helpful, and professional hotel staff you will ever find. The pool is really fun and what sets this hotel apart from the other themed resorts. Rent one of the floats; they're very relaxing, even with kids all around. The sandy botom is great. It really is a beach atmosphere. One of the best things about the Beach Club (and Yacht Club and Boardwalk) is they are located in easy walking distance of Epcot. Because believe me, you might well need a break. We spent the morning and afternnon doing FutureWorld, Living Seas, et cetera, then we went back to the Beach Club, cooled off in the pool, and changed clothes to go back to World Showcase and lightshow in the evening. A great day. Food: The clambake buffet at the Cape May Cafe is very good, make sure you go if you like seafood. The snack bar near the pool has the best french fries I've ever had, and I'm a fry expert. Money savers: get the refillable mug as soon as you get there and you'll save lots of $$ on drinks, as they can add up VERY quickly in the heat. Also, the the gift shop has a deli which has very good breakfast sandwiches for two or three dollars, and made-to-order salads which are very fresh and only six bucks. This is important because you will be spending loads of money on other stuff. But make sure you treat yourself to a night out at Downtown Disney, and eat at Fulton's Crab House. It's on a riverboat in the water, and if it's not too crowded (go after 8), you can get a table outside with lovely views. Entrees are spendy, but get some appetizers and drinks and you'll be a very happy. Save the calories for the Ghiradelli chocolate shop!

Our stay was on Saturday, Feb. 9th. We are big Disney fans and have eaten at this resort before so we always wanted to try it and since we had one night before our cruise, we figured we'd splurge. We booked through a link on this website through bookit.com and saved about $100 off the price on Disney's website. We were able to use Disney's Magical Express too even though we didn't book the room through Disney. Anyway, we arrived around 1:30pm to check in and our only hope was that the room would be ready so we could get to the fabulous pool they have here. Check in took awhile as it appeared there was a problem. I was nervous at first since I'd never used bookit.com before. Well the problem came when it said we were only registered for 1 adult. We actually were 2 adults and our daughters ages 11 & 15. So the person checking us in said she had to speak to a manager to get it changed. I was nervous we'd have to pay more or something. Well the process of getting the manager, etc. took awhile. We were patient but nervous. After some whispering between the manager and cast member, she came back saying our room was not ready but it would be worth the wait. I didn't ask why, but she said to wait another minute and went away to check on something else. When she finally came back she said they had given us a complimentary upgrade to the \"club level\" which is their conceirge floor! We were thrilled as I'd read reports about people staying at this level and it sounded wonderful! Soon conceirge John came to help us with our few carry-on bags and give us a tour of the conceirge floor. We got our special \"gold\" keys and off we went up the elevator. We were welcomed by the 2 staff members at the desk by the elevators and John told us about all of the amenities. Since we were staying only one night we didn't need help with dining reservations or tickets. However, we loved the room (standard but with a good size balcony) and we LOVED the free food & beverages in the lounge. There was sodas, cookies, snacks, dinner and breakfast. We had budgeted about $100 for food for dinner and breakfast the following morning but didn't spend 1 penny of it as all food & drinks were included with the club level. For dinner they served barbeque ribs, a few assorted salads, cheese & crackers, assorted veggies & fruits, soda, alcoholic beverages, cookies, uncrustable pb & j's, etc. It was fabulous! There were always snacks and drinks available. Breakfast included assorted bagels, donuts, fruit, etc. We loved the service on this level! We also found the rooms to be nice. There were 2 queen sized beds, a small fridge, a balcony with 2 chairs (we could see the Epcot ball from our balcony), a sink area with 2 sinks outside the bathroom, a good size bathroom, dresser, ceiling fan, etc. We also LOVED the pool area and spent a few hours there. The pool area is huge! You do need to get wristbands when you enter the pool area by showing your room key. They also have towels there to use. Overall, the Beach Club was everything we hoped it would be and much more!

The main advantage of staying at the DBC is its close proximity to Epcot and MGM otherwise, I feel there are many other delux resorts such as Wilderness Lodge and Animal Kingdom Lodge ( our favourate ) where you can get much more for your money with a much better quality of service and on-site facilities. Finally on a more positive note the stormalong bay pool area is very large and good fun though very crowded most of the time.", "Date": "November 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston", "Title": "\u201cDefinately a Great Place to Stay!\u201d", "Author": "ChillyinBoston", "ReviewID": "UR11023381", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here on our honeymoon this November. We arrived by the Disney bus transportation from the airport, limo would have been better, as you wouldn't make stops before your destination but the bus wasn't bad at all. It actually gave us a chance to check out the other hotels. When we arrived someone actually greeted us outside before we even made it in! She greeted us by our name and mentioned that she had a surprise for us. We were very excited. Well, they upgraded our room for free because we were on our honeymoon! We were now on the club level, which by the way is great and well worth the extra money, it included a huge room with double balconies and the club room that has food and snacks all day. They even had complimentary wine and beer in the evening with appetizers, hot appetizers!! The hotel is very nice, their beach is really nice too... but no swimming allowed. This doesn't matter much due to the fact they have a great pool. They also have a great pirate ship with a water slide for the kids, very cute. Staff was very nice throughout our entire stay, very helpful with dinner reservations. If you need dinner reservations, I highly recommend booking well in advance, if not, have the concierge do it for you... they have special privileges and I believe the restaurants hold some spots for them. We highly recommend the Yachtmand Steakhouse.... excellent! Bottom line, we would definately stay there again. Like I have always said, \"No one quite does it the same as Disney\". You could probably pay less at a non-disney resort, but if you want an experience to remember, stay at a Disney resort it really makes a difference, especially if you have kids...

The Beach Club is light and airy with great restaurants, an awesome pool and is a hop/skip/jump to Epcot. That's why we love it. On our first trip in March 04 we stayed at the Beach Club and loved it so much we stayed there again for 1/2 our Aug 2007 trip. [We stayed at the Polynesian for the second 1/2 of our 2007 trip, separate review.] Splitting the vacation in 2 like this is becoming increasingly popular, according to the fella who helped me book the trip. However, doing so compunds an already ardous planning process, but it's well worth it. You really need a good Disney operator on the line to assist you, some operators are better at their jobs than others, if you get a surly one, call back. I had the pleasure of Russel giving it his best effort - he was outstanding! The Deluxe resorts all have specific pros, proximity to parks in particular is key -- the Beach Club is a short walk from the 'back door' to Epcot [brings you in right around England]. The BC is connected to the Yacht Club and these 2 hotels share Stormalong Bay - the most fabulous pool complex. I like the whole vibe of the Beach Club more than the YC, can't really articulate why, they are almost the same, but BC seems more dynamic. BC - again, very close to Epcot, and an easy, restful quick [10 min] ferry ride to MGM, bus to MK - manageable but can be a drag at night with little ones fatigued from all the fun. If you have little-little kids and plan to focus on MK, the BC might not be the best option in terms of proximity to the park if you are planning long hours there, [see Polynsesian review] but if you don't mind a little shlepping, the Beach Club is beautiful and offers tons of fun in and of itself. Plan to spend time just enjoying the resort on its own, i.e., non-park days. Epcot is so awesome, I could spend a week there, easily, but truthfully, not as much fun for little kids as MK, and is 10x more walking. Pool: gorgeous, huge, fun and relaxing, only for hotel guests. There is one v large waterslide and a small one for little kids that empties into its own pool, 2 huge spas, plus 'sandy' bottom/beach, lazy river and, when we were there last time, a volleyball net where anyone who wanted to got into a serious game of pool volleyball with a 3 ft-diameter beach ball. V fun. There is also a quiet pool somewhere, but we never tried to find it because Stormalong Bay is such fun. One caveat, when we were there, the pool chemistry-irritant level was high, may have something to do with the 'sand' and the challenges faced to keep it clean; the pool is on the chemical-heavy side - if your kids will be in there for a while, goggles are a must, and if you prize a particular bathing suit, maybe opt for a back-up. The pool is awesome, give it at least a day - if you don't get into the pool and experience the waterslide, you will miss out and regret it. Resort: very clean, crisp and fresh- they seem to be continually refreshing here [unobtrusive carpet cleaning and painting going on, both visits], darling Disney-nautical theme. It's a fairly casual vibe, not at all uncommon to see people in the lobby in their pool gear en route to the fun outside; a friend told me of ladies at the G Floridian pool in Chanel ballet flats, shi-shi pool ensembles and don't-take-my-picture large brimmed hats.... nothing like that at BC, not stuffy at all. We had standard rooms both times, last time = an end unit [much larger but at the standard prix, just a bit more walk to the elevator] w/ 2 doubles plus roll-away. We also brought an aerobed because, though I do love this place, if you aren't well-rested, the appurtenant travails of WDW will drive you over the edge and you will see flashes of yourself rattling the gates of Wally World... bring an aerobed, they are happy to provide blankets/sheets. Staff was excellent, friendly and very accomodating, always there to help when asked and prompt, full of personality, etc. There were walk-up wash cloth/towel animal making sessions in the lobby for the kids, very cute. Great store/mini cafe in the hotel. We had our kids' portrait done by the resident pastel artist - she does great work and prefers to work from photo, handy so you need not waste precious Disney time being idle. Not to be too cheesy, but night-time at the BC was also great, such fun to fill you with warm happy memories...After sunset the hotel held campfires with s'mores on the beach [lake beach, not pool beach - they are right next to each other, however] and movies under the stars -projected on a huge movie sceen on the beach with loungechairs arranged in front, complete with popcorn; highly recommend! The arcade was quite large and very crowded, really good blacklight airhockey...if you must, go at an off hour, like in the a.m., when the soda shop is not packed. Speaking of the soda shop - Beach Club / Yacht Club Dining: this last time we were on the dining plan, which should really be called the eat-til-you-explode plan. It is so much food, there is no humanly possible way to consume all that it includes, but we would do it again for convenience's sake and for ease in planning. There are several restaurants between the Beach Club and adjacent Yacht Club. The store/cafe in the BC has more than adequate counter service options and lots of snacks / minimarket. The soda shop is super cute, esp for kids who have not experienced an authentic version - the potential flavor combos of old-fashioned sodas enthralled our kids- chocolate coke, the best of all possible worlds! Good sandwiches, fun atmosphere, but go for early lunch. The soda shop was so crowded at dinner time that it should be avoided. It's physically a small space, very popular, and those waiting head to the arcade next door- the attendant bells, whistles, noise, fullness from overeating because of the dining plan and chocolate coke-buzzed children meld into an aura from hell that is totally overwhelming, could easily sour your experience or give you a migraine. The Yachtsman Steakhouse was simply excellent. It has a quiet, elegant yachtclub / countryclub type atmosphere and the restaurant overlooks the pool. We had a fantastic dinner there with the kids, but this place would also work for grownups-only. There are a couple of other lovely restaurants in these 2 hotels, one with character breakfast, but we got our character meal fix elsewhere - can find under separate review. In all, the fact that there are so many hotel options at WDW and that we went back a second time and plan to return to the BC again next time for 1/2 the trip mean that this place is great!!!", "Date": "October 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vineland, NJ", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location!\u201d", "Author": "lilspitfire", "ReviewID": "UR10079292", "Content": "I just wanted to let anyone know who may be on the fence about this resort to go ahead and book it.

The resort has loads of great facilities: a gym, beauty salon, a brilliant pool complex, and there's a Disney Club where kids can go in the evenings (although my nephew informed me their evening activities involved \"playing video games and washing our hands a lot\"). The only thing which let us down here was the hotel catering, There is a great buffet breakfast (which even includes pizza, lard lovers), with Disney characters in attendance, which the kids just love. However, but their facilities are too small to cope with the number of guests, so you can end up queuing for half an hour for breakfast, or having to book in advance (who wants to book for breakfast?!); this seems like a considerable oversight. The hotel provides a \"clambake\" buffet style restaurant in the evening too, which is OK if you like a buffet and seafood, but there's nothing else on offer in the hotel. In fairness there are places within walking distance where you can go off and eat, and we found the steak restaurant in the Yacht Club was by far and away the best (if pricey).

There was a small pool for toddlers which was perfect for my one year old. A beach area which kept my four year old busy making sandcastles for hours. There was a lazy river, a whirlpool area, kids club pool area, and a waterslide which started from the pirate ship. Even had a tiny waterslide for the little ones who aren't tall enough to go on the big slide. There are tons of lifeguards, plenty of towels and lounge chairs, and a convenient snack bar. Epcot is the only park you can walk to although the Boardwalk resort is across the street should you desire to walk to eat or shop. The shuttles to take you to the other parks are easy to pick up outside the hotel. Since my kids were younger we spent more time at the Magic Kingdom than anywhere else and at the end of the day the shuttle ride seemed longer than it was. I would probably consider the Grand Floridian next time with it's proximity to the Magic Kingdom if that would be the focus with younger children as opposed to Epcot where there is not much for young kids to see. We ate at the buffet two nights because it was really our only choice. Found it to be OK food and overpriced. One night we ate at the 50's diner and thought the value was better. The gym was outstanding. Lots of cardio machines and plenty of weights. We stayed at the Club Level which had it's own concierges who were certainly very helpful.

I liked the Epcot Resort Area and wanted a hotel this time around in that same area. After doing some research and even seeing Samantha Brown on the Travel Channel glorify this resort I planned to stay here. I was a bit disappointed in the result. The other resorts were much better. This is how my experience of the hotel and my trip went: Well I had a blast going on vacation with my mom and dad...The flight to Florida got their earlier than we expected ...We got the Magical Express bus right away (I love not having to deal with the luggage as well, Disney outdid themselves with these perks). We got to the resort super early...when I went to check-in the room was already ready...YES!...my travel agent had made note that it was my b-day and the girl at the counter gave me a button that I proudly wore...she advised me to wear it cuz \"you never know what could happen\". We were a 5 min walk to the entrance of Epcot so we walked over their and the fun started right away...the weather was great for most of the week. I got a call from \"Goofy\" to sing me happy birthday and I got b-day wishes all through the park...at one ride they mention to the whole audience that it was my b-day..yes mighty embarassing...and at 2 resteraunts I got free desert. Another guy gave me \"b-day stickers\". So I kept my button on ALL week. It was pretty cool. Also my cousins that live in Orlando came and we went to dinner at Rainforest Cafe (Which I OVE) and they surprised me with a cake at the resteraunt too...needless to say there was more singing and more embarrassment:-D Now for the bad: Although the Beach Club was a \"deluxe\" resort and it got rave reviews I was a bit disappointed with it as opposed to other resorts I had stayed in at Disney. First although I had a room with a balcony the view was of a gravel roof and if you looked far to the right you could get a glimpse of part of the pool. With the exception of one day housekeeping did not do a very good job...when I first arrived I found a package of coffee that was open, coffee cups we used were not properly rinsed, towels we used were NOT replaced instead the ones that weren't used were rearranged to cover up the missing towels, there was crayon marks all over the balcony floor and the balcony wall, a towel that had a black mark on it was folded and placed in the bathroom...needless to say I never used ANY towels there except to wipe down a counter or place on the bathroom floor since there were no bath mats. Actually I never use towels ANYWHERE else but my own...Even at home I have my own towel that NO ONE is allowed to use. Call me picky but I am NOT going to use a towel to wipe myself with something that god knows who was wiping what just before! Also the floor needed vacumming. Then our coffee maker stopped working half way through the trip. On 2 occassions our \"tickets\" (Which are also our room keys) got demagnetized and had to go to guest services to get new ones....Don't get me wrong the hotel was not bad but I have stayed at other hotels there that were sooooo clean you could eat off the floor. I think it may have been more lazy staff than a problem with the hotel but it kind of put me off. The staff however resolved any issues I had right away...I told them about the tickets and the coffee maker and they resolved it right away without any obnoxious questions. Also there had been no hotel stationary in the room which I always bring back for scrapbooking purposes and I asked guest services and they sent some up to my room and layed it out nicely for me. The staff (Aside from housekeeping) was wonderful. Even in the store my dad had purchased something at another store and even though it was not an item sold in the hotel store they let us exchange it for something else with no problem. I know this is Disney policy because we had something similiar happen on a previous trip but there was still no hassle which is always great. On Tuesday (The actual day of my b-day) we were on a ride and a man was sneezing in front of us on line...that night I got a really bad sore throat. I woke up the next day sick as a dog. We made our way to Downtown Disney to do some shopping... we also had lunch at Bongo's...I made an effort as I did not want to miss out but after a couple of hours I had to go back to the hotel and stayed in bed...I found cold medicine in the hotel store and slept the day away...so I basically lost half a day of vacation in bed sick...the rest of the trip I went on to the parks and stuff but still continue to recover from my cold...I haven't had a cold in YEARS but I was just glad it wasn't my usual resperatory infections because those would have had be in bed for the rest of the trip and at least with a cold I can cure it with over the counter meds and I recover pretty quick and can at least fuction even if I am sick....I missed out on a couple of the \"water\" rides as I did not want to get wet (Especially with all the AC) and get more sick... but that moves me on to the next thing. RAIN...Florida had been going through a dry spell so of course it decides to correct its issue on the final days of my trip...it rained for about 2 days off and on...the day before we left it poured all night and was cloudy and rainy in the day but we went to the parks because we wanted to make due of our last day...the sun peaked out for about 5 mins...and seeing as it was rainy and cloudy all day I forgot to put on sunblock...and wahlah I got sunburn on my shoulders... Another thing that drove me nuts were these friggin' bugs...I noticed as soon as we got there these bugs that were EVERYWHERE...it was like a bad horror movie...these bugs were litterally flying around \"attached\". It was mating season for these bugs and they would fly around attached to each other and land on anything, including YOU...which I HATE bugs...they were a nusance and I killed my fair share...I asked my cousin about it and he told me that they only come out like this 2 weeks a year...and of course it had to be in the 1 week I was there *Sigh*. While Florida was rainy and high winds with a tropical storm I was watching how NY weather was sunny and in the 90's. Then the day we are coming back the weather forcast for Florida for that week 90's and sunny and NY rainy. I was starting to think it was ME! We left sunny warm wonderful Florida for NY which was pouring rain our flight was supposed to come in at 7:00pm but due to the weather we had to keep flying around and around till the plane got clearance...my dad was not a happy camper (as he hates to fly) and we did not get into NY till 8:30 and it WAS pouring and chilly...not the best weather for trying to recover from a cold. I was just glad I chose to go through Jet-Blue as I kept myself entertained watching \"Cris Angel-Mind Freak\" on Direct-TV and they got plenty of leg room and snacks.

A few quirks add up to a not so deluxe hotel. At the Poly, guests and castmembers alike greet each other warmly, a nice Aloha, almost like family. At the Beach club it was an entirely different feel: stuffy, pretentious people everywhere. If all your clothing has an IZOD gator logo on it, you always turn your collars up, and you greet your guests with a \"Dahhrliiing its been so longggg\" with a couple of \"air-kisses\" thrown in for good measure then this is the place for you... The much bragged about pool was okay - hardly a \"miniature water park\" as one site listed it. Nice but again other resorts have equally nice pools. No food court for breakfast - just a small selection of muffins and one hot entree in the gift shop. The bathrooms at this resort were smaller and more cramped than those at the moderates, and we were in a deluxe room. No privacy at the sinks from the rest of the room ( again the moderates offer a door or curtain to separate the bathroom area from the rest of the room.

For the cost involved and considering all aspects, cleanliness, closeness to the parks, resort amenities, staff friendliness, and professionalism and food availability. I would have to go with a thumbs down on this one. If you're looking for a good moderate I recommend the Port Orleans French Quarter, top of the line.

We used the Magical Bus to get to the hotel. It was a bit delayed at the airport, which added to the anxiety of wanting to 'just get there already'. Check-in was easy. Our room was on the lower level, right near the kids babysitting area. At first I was a bit leary, but honestly we never heard the kiddos. However, the people in the hallway were very loud......don't people realize that when it is 7 am, not everyone is up? Having stayed here before, once in the villa, and once in the resort; I knew what to expect for atmosphere and amenities. I was surprised to see that his room was very different (smaller, not as well appointed) as the one I stayed in last July. When I asked about this at the desk, no one could tell me the reason. In fact, I think they thought I was nuts. But I know it was smaller and seemed a bit 'older'. Anyway....the room was immaculate, and was made up perfectly each day. Our second to last day, we did get a knock at 8 am for mousekeeping. I knew I should have asked for one of those 'do not disturb' signs. The location of the Beach Club is perfect. Walk to Epcot and you can walk to MGM. The pools are wonderful, the beach and looking out over the boardwalk area is just fun! Mostly families and older couples stay here. No problems with unsupervised teens, etc. The employees in the Marketplace (where you can get food, etc.,) were very friendly. We did buy the $11.99 refillable mug and got a lot of use from it. We brought our own breakfast items (bagels, yogurt) and supplemented with the fresh fruit purchased in the Marketplace. We did eat at Beaches and Cream for our last lunch there. The food was really good and great, friendly service. What it boils down to is you are paying for the location. We were hardly ever in our room. We did use the pools.

We were upgraded for free to the concierge level without even asking which was nice but we still felt the upgrade was not worth the price.(and as mentioned, it was free.) As other's have mentioned, some of the property is in need of updating. The room had to have been a recent renovate because it was as expected, very nice. I found the pool area really run down. However, it may be do to the unruly guests and not the lack of trying by the hotel staff. We also were assigned a room at the very end of a hallway. We did not care as we are mid aged and \"somewhat\" fit however, I noticed a few people who where having trouble and complaining of the distance they were away from the elevators. Everything in Disney is a far walk, including your room. We stayed at the Hard Rock for 3 nights and it just seemed to be a better run facility and was in much nicer condition. It was also cheaper than the beach club. (not by much though) I feel since we stayed there first I had a comparable park hotel to go apples to apples with the beach club, although nice, it just lacked the Magic. I will also mention that Disney Fast Pass doesn't even come close to the Universal express. (The express is what you hope for for the money.)

Five of us (kids ages 9, 7 and 5) fit comfortably in a standard room with two queen size beds and a single day bed. Although a little tight, the only time we spent in the room was to sleep and change our clothes. The room, including the bathroom, was clean and we did not experience any of the problems others referred to in their reviews. Disney offers a number of resort choices for a variety of budgets. The two things that make the Beach Club standout from the others is the amazing pool and it's close proximity to Epcot and MGM. The pool was awesome for people of all ages. First, it was huge and meandered around the property. While there were alot of people using the pool, it never felt crowded and you could find a chair or two, particularly in the sun. Unlike other resorts I have visited, the chairs in the shade were the first to go. The depth ranged from 2 feet to 6 feet. The big hit with my family was the part of the pool that had a large mound of sand in the middle of it. It was like going to the beach and my five year old son loved sitting in the water and playing in the sand with the bucket and shovel that could be found all over the place. The sand is the unique feature of this pool...it is on the bottom of the entire pool. For the older kids and adults there is a real nice water slide and a whirlpool area in the main pool. As I said before, the other thing that makes the Beach Club standout is it's promximity to Epcot and MGM. For Epoct it is a five minute walk to the back gate. This was great as we were able to run and catch Illuminations several times during our stay. To get to MGM it is a short boat ride or about a mile long walk. We always took the boat which seemed to run on a 15 minute schedule. Bus transportation is provided to reach all of the other parts of Walt Disney World. All in all, a very pleasant experience and we will definitely return to the Beach Club when we return to Disney.

My room was large with no strange odors. My daughter loved the fact that the offered a stocked fridge and candy, but after I explained that they charged for even picking up a candy bar, she understood. The main reason I picked this hotel was for the pool! It is awesome! The slide is the best and I have no idea how they make that sandy \"sinkiing\" bottom. Another section of the pool has a slight current to it, so you can enjoy a nice lazy ride in a tube if you want. And still another section of the 3 acre pool is especially made for children. Very nice, Disney. The burgers at Hurricane Hannas are the best! I didn't partake in the character breakfast, as we have done plenty of those in the past years, so I cannot comment. I will say that when we walked by, it looked as though patrons were enjoying themselves. I do recommend that if you stay at a Disney hotel and you have purchased a vacation package, add the dining package too, it will save you some serious $$. The proximity of this hotel to not only Epcot, but also to MGM Studios is ideal. If you are just going to be visiting the Disney parks, then you can utilize the Disney transportation, and not have to waste money on a car rental. I will say though, the buses are not the greatest. Oh they are very clean - but if you don't time it right - there can be quite a wait. I found the staff to be quite attentive. I am a pretty laid back person, and I like to joke around a lot and I found that most of the staff were much like I am. We are all just big kids! I can highly recommend this property.

Check-in was a little slow....we got into the room at 3:30. Not terrible, but we did have to kill a couple of hours before we got into the room. The room itself was nice...clean, comfy beds, fridge, safe and plenty of storage. The toilet/tub were separated by a door from a double-sink vanity, and our room had a nice balcony overlooking the lagoon. Bed linens and towels were adequate, but certainly not anything above-average or luxurious. Maid service was prompt and efficient on a daily basis. Definitely enough storage for a family of four, and the bath setup works well for a family, too. There is a fabulous pool complex on this property (shared with Disney's Yacht Club). I counted 3 separate pool areas...a \"lazy river\", a sand-bottom swimming pool, and a \"beach\" pool...lots of sand for the little ones to build sand castles...reminded me of the beach! Towel service was great...I actually liked the pool towels better than the ones in the room! The pool was heated to just about the perfect temperature. There was a water slide (similar to one you would expect to see in a large water park) and it looked fun. There didn't appear to be a huge wait at any particular time. The pool hours seemed \"short\"...I know that my kids would not have been happy about the closing time of 8 p.m.! There was another small pool close to our room, and I'm not sure if the 8pm rule applied, but swimmers stayed in that pool longer (noise was not an issue). It is literally a 5-minute walk to Epcot, and a short water-taxi ride (10-15 minutes) to MGM. There was never a huge wait for the water taxis. Bus service to the other parks and Downtown Disney was regular and efficient. The \"Boardwalk\" with restaurants and entertainment was also a short walk (5-10 minutes) from the property. There is a marketplace where one can purchase souvenirs, sundries and deli-types foods (pre-made sandwiches, salads) along with beverages (including beer/wine). We did purchase a bottle of wine, but had to request an opener from housekeeping...it was delivered very quickly! There were also several other restaurants on the property with various price ranges and levels of service. The resort does charge a fee for internet service. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay.

While the hotel has the best location and most amazing pools of all the Disney resorts, it couldn't make up for the frustrations we experienced. One of the reasons we stay at the Beach Club is for the gracious service we receive. Unfortunately, service on this trip was lacking. There were multiple problems with rooms for our gathering (required handicap accomodations), there were mistakes with dining reservations, and bus service was pretty bad (waited 50 minutes for animal kingdom). Purchases were not delivered to correct rooms and upon check out, room charges were placed on the wrong credit cards. I don't go on vacations expecting them to be perfect, I think it's normal for there to be a slip-up every now and then. I do, however, expect better when paying $315.00 per night. We got locked out of our room one night because the carpet cleaners knocked the door handle off our door. While waiting for maintenance, I chatted with one of the employees from the concierge desk and told her about some of the problems we'd experienced. She told me the service issues were due to the conventions and conferences booked by Disney during the slower times. She stated that there are two different areas that coordinate reservations - one for family-oriented travel and one for large groups - the two do not do a good job communicating or coordinating activity. There were lot's of conferences the week we were there (GF, Poly and Contemporary all sold out) so I'm starting to think she was right. Positives - boat service, cleaning staff, bell staff, pools, proximity to Boardwalk, Epcot and MGM. Negatives- too many mistakes with rooms at check in and check out, bus service, pool hours (closes at 8pm), Concierge desk (dining reservation mistakes, failure to deliver purchases) and the staff in general.

I think as a family trip Disney was our best ever and would definetly recommend all families if they can to take thier kids at least once. Our big debate upon going was whether to stay in a disney property or not. Everyone I spoke to said that it was worth while to stay on site as you did not have to rent a car and could maximize your stay in the park. I would agree with that as if you want to get to the parks early then it is best to stay on site. We found the disney transportation very easy to use and much much easier than parking a car. In fact, one of the highlights of our trip was our 6 year old son having to sit in the front of the bus behind the driver on every trip to make sure we didn't miss our stop. We enjoyed all the parks especially epcot and mk. We felt with the fast pass we were generally able to see what ever we wanted to see without an excessive amount of waiting. As far as the hotel property itself the pool was amazing and we spent 2 of our 9 days just relaxing at the \"beach\". They also have a guy who plays soccer with the kids at around 2 every afternoon which my boys really enjoyed. The slides were really fun for kids and adults and they have a smaller pool by the slide with slides for the smaller kids which was quite fun. The layout of the hotel is vey spread out which makes for alot of walking. Service was good and the people who worked in the giftshop were really nice. Some of the front desk staff were not especially knowledgable. Our only real complaint was the size of the room. Our kids walked into the hotel and said is this the little peoples room. We generally stay in suite hotels and even in mexico a one room was much bigger than this. Our youngest slept in a day bed and i dont think you could expect any over 10 to sleep in a bed like that. However, we all said that we spent so little time in the room it didnt matter. However that being the case we would defintely not spend the extra to stay in a more expensive property but instead gget 2 connecting rooms in an budget hotel and be more comfortable at night and spend less money. In fact on our next trip we would likely stay off site in a suites hotel and go to disney and other attractions but for a first trip with young kids this was a great place to stay and would reccommend the property. We also thought the disney dining plan and enjoyed all the sit down restaurants. We went Beaches and Cream on site and our kids stll talk about the kitchen sink. We also enjoyed the Yacht club Galley where they had a great desserts for the kids. It was a puzzle that they put together made out of white chocolate with eedible colored paint. Never saw anything like that before. we also enjoyed the under the sea restaurant at Epcot where you ccan watch scuba divers in an undersea environment. We also eenjoyed the Crystal Palace restaurant where they had Winnie the Pooh characters. The restaurant on site was a buffet and we went there for breakfast and the dinner.

Our room had the patio, was a larger room than the standard ones - two queen beds and a day bed. It was very comfortable for three adults. Nice sized bathroom area with double vanity. Plenty of hangers in the closet. High speed internet (for a modest daily fee). Room was very clean. My husband noticed that the lock on the patio door was not working and reported it to the front desk in the a.m. It was replaced (not just repaired) by the time we returned in the evening. Lots of fun Disney touches in the rooms from the soaps to the the chocolate picture frame with a \"picture\" of the hotel in white chocolate! There was a fruit plate and a vase of fresh roses in the room as part of the greeting. Beach Club is also great for location, location, location. The water taxi is just steps away and we used it to get to Epcot, but it's also just a 3 minute walk from BC to Epcot. Buses were efficient and got us to and from Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, MGM. Longest we had to wait was probably 10 minutes for a bus or boat. The Marketplace store in the hotel is perfect for picking up snacks (packaged or food they prepare on site). Much more than a gift store. Making reservations for dinners was very easy - we didn't plan ahead so we didn't always get our first choice for dinner, but we weren't disappointed. Well, maybe the first night, when we had limited options and ate at the Yacht Club Galley. 2nd night we ate at Oktoberfest buffet in Epcot (Germany) and thoroughly enjoyed the food and drink. For a buffet, it was outstanding. Next night we dined at the Moroccan restaurant and that also was very good. But the best meal came on our last evening when we ate at Jiko located in the Animal Kingdom Lodge. One son had the beef shortribs marinated in a tamarind sauce and served over a sweet potato gratin. Another had lamb (both these dishes were generous portions). Others had the shrimp or char (like salmon), and scallops. All very well prepared and delicious. They have a wonderful dinner salad where the dressing is a combination of watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew juices. Wonderful! We sampled cheeses and shared a bottle of South African wine, and had dessert. Total bill was around $320 for six adults. Back to the Beach Club Resort though. They delivered on all promises, including the hassle-free transportation from and back to the airport.

The \"beach\" - Stormalong Bay, is perfect for young children, with its \"0 depth entry\" and its shallow maximum depth. The 4 year old and 3 year old in our party could both play for hours without having an adult hold them at all times. The resort puts on a short (30-60 minutes) kids physical activity program at the \"beach\" part of the pool, which is a nice touch (and free, but the times are somewhat random). The kiddie waterslide and larger waterslide are both great fun for the kids (and some of our adults!). The suite, along with the other standard room our party occupied, were certainly clean and well maintained, but were nowhere near the fit and finish one might expect for the price. The maid service was efficient. What you do get, in exchange for the obvious premium that you pay on the room (relative to a similarly priced non-Disney hotel), is excellent walking access to Epcot (5 min.) and MGM (15 min.), and decently close bus or car/taxi access to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom. The boardwalk, with restaurants, a few nightclubs, and stores, is also only a five minute walk from the pool. The The extra-magic hours concept, with access to the theme parks for a few extra hours, during which only Disney resort guests are allowed to visit, is a nice touch. The valet service was efficient, as was the \"magic express\" airport service for those members of our party who used it. The concierge service was also efficient.

We walk to all but MGM since it's easy and faster. There are also games at the pool in the afternoon and a giant waterslide which can be enjoyed by all ages as long as you can swim unassisted to the side. At 50 I still like it! Oh and 3 hot tubs too. The only disappointment for us is that Disney keeps on taking things away. This year we were very disappointed to find the main pool hours reduced. Every year we go there is less on the buffet at Cape May. It used to be good and now is merely convenient, but there is very good dining at The Boardwalk or Epcot which are just a short stroll away. Many of the old \"magical\" touches have vanished. But it is still our favorite place. If you are seeking a quiet getaway, forget it. With very young children it might be a bit overwhelming too.

The use of the \"magical express\" is actually enough of a reason to stay on property in my opinion. With that in mind, I am very sad to have to write this review. We've been to Disney several times in the past few years, and we really enjoy the location and what the property at the BC has to offer. The pool is wonderful, the buffet at the clambake is good, as is the character breakfast. The property itself is still in nice shape, but the entire time we were there, (4 days) one elevator was broken and never fixed. Anyone who has never stayed at this hotel before and isn't a fan of the magic and energy that Disney has to offer, will probably think this place is just fine. In our family's case, we spent the extra money to give the children (2, 9, 10) that Disney feeling--the one where everyone is happy, polite, and goes out of their way to make your stay \"magical\"---it's what Disney is supposed to be all about. Unfortunately, this is no longer the case at the Beach Club. Upon check-in the girl behind the desk gave us a slight room upgrade with a better view--that was the one and only time someone went out of their way to do something nice. Actually, to see someone on the staff happy, or to hear a greeting when you passed by them was an oddity rather than the norm. We actually heard the staff complaining about their jobs by the pool--it wasn't hard, they were yelling across to one another and having a sort of count down until they were off duty while guests were right there. Their only consulation was that as of the week we were there they now closed the pool at 8:00--great for them, but not so good for us, as it was August in Florida. Also, while there, my 2 year old son got sick and we had to have a prescription delivered. When the prescription arrived at the front desk, I asked the girl there if someone could please bring it to my room. I was told no, they didn't have anyone to do that, but I could pick it up. The lack of customer service has slipped at the parks as well,and that is really sad! (i.e.--staff at kiosks that didn't know where changing stations or certain rides were, trash on the floor of the teacups) Overall, when you pay for Disney, you pay for the \"magic\" that has always come with it. Afterall, they call every worker on property a \"cast member\", they are there to put on a happy show and to make you feel like reality is a million miles away.

It was expensive, but worth it. We stayed in a suite allowing us to use a lounge on the 5th floor where there was constant food served for free. Also free Wall Street Journal, New York Times and USA Today. A nice respite after hours of fantasyland and plastic. The beds were wonderful. High-quality linens, soft, clean and cushy.

Yes, pools in which they have dumped sand. Weird, but nice. There's a great store on the first floor where everything you need is available. Breakfast cereals for kids, clothes, gelato, coffee, fresh-baked pastries. Disney characters are apparently at breakfast downstairs. My wife said the Mickey Mouse shaped waffles were delicious.

As such, you would expect service and ammenties to meet certain standards. Not only is the Beach Club resort a cramped and overcrowded mega-hotel, the staff is completely unprepared to deal with the day to day realities of running such an establishment. To begin with, turnover of rooms is inefficient. On a daily basis, there are families camped out in the lobby waiting to check in to their miniscule rooms. It reminds one of an airport terminal- only louder- as there is no carpeting to dampen the din of weary travellers and crying babies. When the families do finally get to check in to their room, they are usually sorely disappointed with the size and location of their room. The rooms are cramped and provide only one desk chair- inconvenient if your party wishes to dine on room serivce (the only readily available means to get fed on site since all of the restaurants in the resort have been fully booked 180 days in advance). During our stay, we had to change rooms twice because of the overwhelming stench of cigarettes that seemed to be pumped throught the bathroom exhaust vents. There is only one elevator bank that is located in the middle of the huge complex. It is typically a very long walk to get from that elevator to your room....and the walk from your room- to elevator- to outdoor pool complex could take 15 minutes and qualify as daily exercise! Try doing this twice a day with a toddler- it is pure torture. The only saving grace of the entire place is the fact that you can walk to Epcot in less than 10 minutes. It seems as if Disney has done everything possible to make the Beach Club Resort an inconvenient and uncomfortable place to stay- so that you will be forced to spend most of your time in one of the themes parks where you will most likely spend more money.

You can take the boat to MGM though we didn't particularly enjoy that park as there is a lot of concrete absorbing that 90 degree heat and then many of the shows are outside, just too hot. We were really glad we stayed at this hotel as it was perfect for the kids and we enjoyed it just as much.

They loved the sand to build castles and felt like they were at the ocean. We talked to a lot of nice families there as well. We liked being so close to Epcot and Boardwalk and only a boat ride from MGM. We never felt like the bus ride to Magic Kingdom or Animal Kingdom was long either. We did have a longer ride to Downtown Disney but luckily we started out early enough to make the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique appointments to turn the 3 girls into princesses, which they loved! The girls loved the stuffed animal arrangements housekeeping provided each day on our return from a park to our room (one day Minnie was reading a story to Thumper, Marie, and Miss Piggy). Beaches and Cream Icecream Parlor was a big hit, too, for ice cream and for hamburgers and hotdogs. We bought groceries from the hotel store for breakfast so the girls could wake up slowly, watch TV, and eat while we helped them get ready each morning. One morning we ate at the character breakfast in the hotel, which the girls loved. We ate lunch at Cinderella's castle with the princesses one day, too, which was a big hit. Our room was big enough for 5 (2 queens and a daybed), clean, and plenty of storage, with a refrigerator. My only complaint was that we were so far from the lobby, even after I asked to be closer 11 months ahead of time, but after the 1st day I forgot about it because the stay was so nice and pleasant.

This is a great resort with a super pool and lots of things to do. The location is excellent if you plan on spending a lot of time at Epcot, the Boardwalk, or MGM. It is within walking distance of both Epcot and the Boardwalk and a short boat ride to MGM. Bus service is offered if traveling to the Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom, or water parks, and we never had to wait for very long. The hotel itself is very large and sprawling. It is attached to the Yacht Club Resort, but you would never know it unless taking a stroll around the grounds. Upon entering the large lobby, the rooms of the resort are to the left and spread out in a \"stair-step\" pattern, with some of them being very remote. The restaurant (Cape May Cafe), lounge, arcade, and ice cream parlor (Beaches and Cream) are all located to the right of the lobby and face the pool, so that all the \"common\" areas of the resort are actually in the center of the two resorts, which form a semi-circle around the very large pool. There is also a gift shop right off the lobby, which now serves sandwiches and breakfast items, drinks, and snacks served from 7am-11pm and is extremely handy as there is no \"food court/quick service\" available as in other Disney resorts. There is also an outdoor poolside \"grill\" serving the usual hot dogs and hamburgers. I would have to say that the one downfall of this resort is the lack of dining options, but with the Boardwalk and Epcot so close, there is a vast array of great dining choices available nearby...just remember to make your priority seating arrangements (especially for dinner). The rooms at the Beach Club, as in all the Disney resorts, were very clean and comfortable. There have been comments that the rooms are not spacious enough, but we did not have any problems with 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 7 & 11). They are decorated with a beach theme and very pleasing, with two queen beds and a small daybed/sofa for sleeping, upright bureau and closet space for your clothes, and countertop area with a small built-in refrigerator and storage underneath for food items. The bathroom was nice because it had a double sink area outside the bath/toilet area so that more than one person can get ready at the same time. We paid extra for a \"water-view\" room and requested a ground-floor room which was great because it had a small patio which we very much enjoyed sitting out on during the evenings. The upper level rooms have small \"walk-out\" balconies which look as if they would only accommodate one or maybe two people; although some of the rooms do have larger sitting balconies. This is simply in keeping with the overall theme of the resort by keeping it architecturally correct (as with all the Disney resorts). Now on to the pool area. The pool at the Beach Club can only be described as...WOW! This is a very large pool which wraps in, out and all around a 3 acre area. The pool is very unique in that it has a sandy bottom throughout and changes between shallow and deep water areas all throughout. There is also a kiddie pool area with a small sandy beach for the little ones; however, it still has some deeper water areas. Separate but adjacent to these pool areas is a lazy river area - but beware, it is very deep (over 6 feet) and the water moves very fast. Also within the main pool is a \"whirlpool\" which is something I have never seen before in a pool. There is a large waterslide that is really cool because it is accessed by climbing up a \"sunken\" ship and then curves and plummets into the pool. This waterslide is not a small one, either! The only downfall of the pool area is the size. If you have small children it will definitely be hard to keep track of them, and the waterslide access is actually not even in the pool area. You must walk out of the pool area and across a walkway that separates the lawn from the sandy beach area fronting the lake. Oh, did I mention that this resort sits on a small lake with beautiful views of the Boardwalk across the way and plenty of room to spread out in the sun and build sand castles with the kids. Just don't try to swim in the lake, as none of the Disney resorts allow swimming the the surrounding lakes. There are so many things to do here, you won't have enough time. All throughout the day, the pool staff organized games of volleyball and other cool things for the kids to do, there is a large arcade, an awesome ice cream parlor (check out the \"kitchen sink\" concoction...but only if you enough mouths to eat it all!), the Boardwalk for entertainment and surrey bike rentals, the large pool and also a quiet pool, and a large beautiful lawn for enjoying a game of catch or frisbee with the kids. This is the best place to stay if you like Epcot as you can walk to Epcot and enter into the World Showcase between England and France. I would recommend the Beach Club more for families with older kids or teens, but it would be a great choice for anyone.

It is absolutely worth it to stay in Disney properties, and to choose a location nearest the attractions where you plan to spend the most time. Use of the WDW transportation system alone makes it worthwhile to spend a bit more on Disney resorts. We just returned from our second stay at Disney's Beach Club Resort. We always have dinner at the Epcot restaurants and usually at the Boardwalk, so it's easy to walk to dinner at either place from the Beach Club, as well as to attractions at Epcot. It's also just a short pleasant boat ride to MGM Studios, which is our favorite for attractions. We don't spend much time in the Magic Kingdom (if we did, we'd stay at the Grand Floridian) and the Animal Kingdom is a bus ride from anywhere. We stayed in a water view room this time, and received a complimentary upgrade to concierge level. Our room had a full balcony overlooking the lake and boardwalk, and the concierge amenities were nice - they would be especially appealing if you have kids. They have complimentary drinks and snacks all day. At breakfast there are cereals, donuts, bagels, fruit and all breakfast beverages. It's very convenient to eat prior to going to the parks. They also serve wine, beer and snacks at happy hour - plus great desserts and afterdinner drinks later in the evening. Our experience at Disney resorts has always been very good (except for one time I stayed in Dixie Landings on a business trip - imagine having a conference call in a place where \"Zip-A-Dee-Do-Dah\" plays non-stop). The rooms are a bit small, but always immaculately clean and well-equipped. The deluxe resorts have better proximity to the parks and boat/monorail transportation, but the moderate resorts also have excellent bus service. All the resorts have super pools. We had dinner at Boma at the Animal Kingdom lodge, based in part on recommendations on this site. The Animal Kingdom Lodge itself is just spectacular, and the Boma buffet was excellent. After dinner, we walked to the perimeter of the property where it borders the animal park. We were offered night vision goggle, and saw a herd of gazelles, a couple bongos and five giraffes (including a baby giraffe). The giraffes came within 20 feet of us to graze! It was all so impressive we've decided to stay at the Animal Kingdom Lodge the next time we return. Following the suggestion in the Unofficial Guide, we also booked the Fantasmic! dinner package at the Brown Derby in MGM Studios. The dinner was excellent, but the priority seating for the Fantasmic show was a bit overrated - at least for the time we were there. We would not have waited any longer for regular seating. I was pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to wait in any long lines this trip. We usually visit in mid-December, and are rather spoiled because there are no lines for anything at that time of year. But the lines were quite short in April as well. The longest posted wait was 30 minutes, and the wait was always shorter than the time posted. The Animal Kingdom was extremely crowded (it always is due to the bottleneck design of the park) since Expedition Everest had just opened. But we went to Expedition Everest first thing and got a FastPass, and then decided to wait in line since the posted time was 20 minutes. We were in line just long enough to take in all the pre-ride details - and then returned later to ride a second time with our FastPass.

On the positive side, Beach Club is a beautiful and peaceful resort. Animal Kingdom Lodge is a place where you actually want to stay in your room as the views of the savannah were wonderful and the kids took tons of photos right from the balcony. The pool at Animal Kingdom Lodge was a bit green colored and there is not much to do on the resort itself.

We booked this property to be close to the Epcot start on Disney's Marathon weekend. This was just a perfect location for that, especially on Marathon Day as you can watch the runners go by the lake and walk over to the finish if you want. Unfortunately you still have to take the shuttle to the start at 4:30a.m., but that's more of an issue for the marathon organizers, not the hotel. We found being able to watch the runners from the resort a lot more convenient than shuttling to the parks. Also, if you're here for the marathon you will want to get the park hopper option on your pass, otherwise you have to pay to go through Epcot each day if you walk over to the finish (or back from the finish).

Things I loved about this hotel: Location, decor, layout of the facility, pool area/beach, convenience, staff. Our room (3578), while not having a great view, was a straight on shot of the Epcot fireworks. We could even hear the music if we opened the door to our mini balcony. It was great to be able to walk out and grab the ferry either to the Boardwalk or to Epcot or MGM. Actually, the Boardwalk was an easy walk as were the Swan and Dolphin hotels. There is a great dance hall on the Boardwalk and we did also visit Jelly Rolls which was so much fun - very crowded but a very upbeat fun atmosphere. The hotel has a great little deli in the gift shop that has very good sandwiches and soups (Saturday was a chilly day and they ran out of soup pretty early) and is a convenient and quick stop for a cup of coffee or tea in the morning. They also have a little mini-mart section where you can buy heat and eat type food as well as beer and wine (one important note: a bottle of Mich Ultra was $5.25 - yes, ONE bottle) and there is a microwave to heat up your food to take it back to your room. The pastries there are to die for! I really liked the way the room was decorated - obviously in a beach theme - with blue/white/yellow running throughout. The vanity area is spacious and well-lighted with a make-up mirror and lots of nice Disney toiletries. Plenty of good water pressure and hot water. There is a dresser with good drawer space and several luggage stands tucked away in the closet. There is a mini-fridge. Also, tucked under the desk is a rolling table which I thought was a great idea. I do wish there had been an easy chair, but really wasn't room (we had two double beds - perhaps in the king rooms they have one). We got an especially good deal on the room but I think they can get a bit pricey. Nonetheless, I'd definitely recommend this resort to one and all. Oh, one thing to note for folks that do not have children. This is a family-friendly resort and kids do tend to enjoy themselves running up and down the halls.

Room was clean - not spotless. 2) For 5 days the POOL was not being heated so that you could get into it. At $500 a night we paid to look at it. The spas were not hot either - just warm. Recreation knew about it, lifeguards knew about it, front desk knew about and so did Engineering - I spoke with all of them. Front desk was superb at avoiding the question of when would they heat the pool? (Took two trips to Wilderness Lodge - steam was coming off their pool and it was beautiful) 3) Tennis was great although no sign-up and over at the Yacht Club so make sure you stick around if it seems busy. 4) Cape May Restaurant - overpriced. 5) Very quiet bar in the back corner perfect for a quick break. 6) Kids enjoyed the arcade. 7) If walking is a problem or kids are very little ask for a room in the center - ours was like finding our room in Vegas. 8) Hallways weren't clean and the elevator near our room was broken a few times during our stay. 9) Friendliest staff was in Beaches & Cream, Hurricane Hanna's and Marketplace plus the maids. Front desk was bad, bad, bad. I know it's a busy time, sorry you have to work but it's not an assembly line. So would we return? - all of us said No Way. Recommend: Wilderness Lodge (has never disappointed us and sorry that we tried elsewhere); Take advantage of Magic hours at night. We all napped after Christmas dinner and got up at 11pm. Went to Magic Kingdom with kids (14, 14 & 5) and completed the entire park in three hours! It was fantastic. No lines. Followed the same pattern for the rest of the trip. Only Animal Kingdom wasn't worth it as 75% of the park is closed - although started with a great dinner at Rainforest Cafe.

For this price, I would expect that the staff go the extra mile. You will not find it here. Face it, Disney is a make-believe world and the staff (\"cast members\") act like they want to help. They just don't help much. Specific issues: 1) Asked for a late check-out of an hour or two. Staff told us that it was in our \"contract\" that we could not check out late. When was the last time that a front desk person called your reservation a \"contract\"? Not a good sign. 2) Ferry captain left us as we were walking up to the boat and refused to wait despite the fact that we were standing on the dock when he arrived and he clearly saw that we were waiting for the ferry. We waited in the cold for 30 mins until the next boat came. 3)Asked for directions to ESPN-restaurant. \"Cast member\" confidently told us in was in Downtown Disney. When we got to Downtown Disney, another cast member told us that we got bad information--the restaurant was actually at the Boardwalk--several miles in the other direction. He told us it was a common mistake made by Disney employees and laughed. Meanwhile we wasted a couple of hours. Overall my impression is that the Disney people could care less about their clients...reminds me of flying American or United. Recommendations: Stay off site. Get up early and be there when the park opens. Go to the popular rides and get \"Fast Passes\" as soon as you can. Get a parkhopper pass so you can move from one park to the other on the same day. Leave at 1-2 pm to miss the crowds. Eat off site. There is not superb restaurant in the entire resort. For the price and the waiting times, you are much better off a few miles off the resort where restaurants abound. We went to Islands of Adventure at Universal for the day and the folks there seemed more friendly and sincere than the Disney folks--but then they are not \"cast members\", just real people with a job to do. By the way, the staff at Disney would not assist us in any way with our tickets to Universal.

I was nervous of a family of four staying in one room (we usually get a suite), but it worked out just fine! Here are some things I noted: 1) Marketplace is not well publicized-- it's a little gift shop/grocery in the resort. They have really expensive cereals, so be sure to bring your own. But you can get things like beer/wine and milk for a higher price (but cheaper than cab fare to the nearest grocer). I will bring our own cereal next time though. 2) Marketplace doesn't open till 7am!! So if you want early morning coffee- you can get it at the Yacht club as early as 6am. I don't know why they open so \"late\". 3) The kids club at the Y&B club is WAY-better than the one at the Grand Floridian. Lots more space and just generally nicer. We took our kids to the GF club because we \"assumed\" it would be nicer-- wrong! (It was fine, but my kids are 8 & 11 and they felt cramped). 4) The beach area by the big boat is quiet-- so if you are looking to get away from the loudness by the big pool area, hang out there. 5) Yacht Club steakhouse is expensive but really great. We had the lobster/steak dinner and it was wonderful. I liked this dinner better than the one at Citricos. 6) Housekeeping was not very good. They cleaned well enough (when they came), but it was terribly unreliable. We asked for turndown and never got it. One afternoon, we put the privacy sign out on our door so we could nap (since they hadn't come to clean our room yet although we asked for an early morning cleanup). Then within 20 minutes into our 2pm nap, housekeeping calls us to ask if we want maid service! (They evidently wanted to clean our room regardless of our \"privacy\" sign). We reported this to management but they weren't too sympathetic really. ) Needless to say, there was no nap after that wake-up call! We were really surprised it was so inconsistent and unreliable (we are housekeeping tippers too!). 7) Pool is awesome. The quiet pool was also a nice place to swim (and the water warmer there too). The lifeguards are very alert (and many of them)! 8) Most of the people working there are very nice. There seem to be issues in the busier spots (like Hurrican Hannahs and some in the marketplace) where they have lost that \"Disney magic\". But most folks were really very courteous and nice. The gentleman at the front door greeting folks was especially nice with the kiddos. If we ever go again (and can afford it), we will stay at the Beach (or Yacht) club again.

Cons: Hotel room was very simple. 1 bed, 2 hard chairs and a TV set. My room overlooked the roof and dumpster area which kept us with the air on and balcony doors closed. Lifeguards at the pool are similar to WWII German soldiers. I can picture them with german shepards and rifles. As a 36 year old man visiting Disney with no children I certainly didn't appreciate the young lifeguard yelling from across the pool \"EXIT THE POOL PLEASE\". The young KGB agent got excited because my wife came to the edge of the 3 feet deep section where I was wading and handed me a 2 oz plastic cup sample of a drink she wanted me to try. As if spilling it would destroy the PH balance of 500,000 gallons of water. Another one made sure I understood there was no diving because while IN the water I pushed off the edge of the pool in the 8' deep section (once mind you) and mimic'd a diving action. While it is possible my torso left the water for an inch or two, I'd hardly consider it a dive. Still, the soldier felt inclined to mention it to me. I'm guessing because there were only 4 other people in the pool at the time and he was bored. EPCOT: France Our dinner took 2 1/2 hours. Thank God we ordered a bottle of wine and not just a glass. It's just 2 glasses each but our waiter was nowhere to be seen most of the time. The food was quite good once we got it but considering it was 2 1/2 hours, I couldn't help but think about all the things we were missing while we were held captive at their restaurant. We also ran into a French lad in their store. I'm not sure what his name was but he was a tall black man in his early to mid 20s. My wife happened to take French for 8 years in school so while she's not fluent, she can break apart a lot of what is said and translate it for me. The young man greeted us, my wife responded \"hello\" in French which prompted the \"cast member\" to ask if she was fluent and followed it up with \"Ah Hah. I can shake my sholdAirs too and say a few verds, but can you hold a conversation?\". There was something else he said but I was already upset that he just made my wife feel like a fraud. All she said was hello in a perfect French accent so the young man felt inclined to call her out as a fraud. Unnecessary, and I can think of 100 other ways to greet her into his store while enjoying the little French she knows instead of reminding her what she DIDN'T know. Not Beach Club related I know, but figured it was worth mentioning. PROS: Front Desk: I was really impressed by one young man behind the front desk who was just done with his guest and was ready to take another. Instead of calling out he walked 15 feet to his left until he was in front of another guest waiting for help and said \"I'll take you down here sir\" and then walked back to his \"area\". I found that to be very friendly, personal and professional. Beach club and Yacht club pools are fantastic. Sand bottom pools are a real joy to swim in. The entire staff (other than the lifeguards) were very friendly.The staff at the pool side food and bar was a pleasure to be around, especially Rita. The area is the perfect. You can take the ferry to EPCOT or easily walk the 5 minutes. Walking is faster but the ferry ride is kind of nice too. The boardwalk area is accessable in either direction. Just start walking. Ferry dock will take you to MGM as well and the busses out front were frequent and easy. Aside from my 2 negative experiences, the week was excellent. We used the dining plan which made things much easier. The hotel was clean and the Yacht clubs steak house was delicious. While it might look the same inside, next time we plan on staying at the Yacht club only because we prefer that side of the pool/s. Oh yeah, the elevators at the Beach Club are the fastest I've been on. Going from the 4th floor to the 1st is as fast as MGM's Tower of Terror.

Our room was miles away from the elevator, and upon requesting a room closer to these (my father is elder and cannot go these distances) they suggested we rent a scooter.

We had to call room service to clean it up, which they did.

The buses to Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom were exceedingly slow (waits of 45 minutes for the bus were not uncommon in the middle of the day), but I have experienced that at other resorts as well.

We visited the week after Hurricane Charlie and Frances in September, we were postponed a week due to the storms. We were able to reschedule our reservation without penalty or problems. Except, I was not able to re-book the Princess breakfast at Cinderella's castle that I had succeeded in getting! That was a real let down to my 6 and 7 year old girls. Disney could not or would not assist us with that. We rented a car (great idea with 3 small children!) so we arrived and were greeted by lots of valet/doormen, most of whom do not smile. They might crack one if you tip them though. They seem to be waiting for that constantly. The check in was very slow. (They were training a new empolyee and took their time to explain every detail to her on our time!) But, eventually we got to our room on the 3rd floor with a standing only balcony of the lagoon. The room was adequate, a crib and refridgerator were in place as requested. Room was clean, and cool, beds comfortable. We were in a quiet area. Pool: The kids loved it! The waterslide was great, for th kids, and the zero entry sand entrance was perfect for our 18 month old. Now for the adult ONLY noticed stuff. The area where you can sit with the babies where the water is shallow is way around the back of the pool, and you have to walk all the way around to get to the restroom or bar. My husband was scolded at loudly by a career lifeguard for carrying a drink (in a plastic cup) through the water. There was an occasional drink waitress, but she didn't venture into the far end of the pool. The little wading pool and climbing area were in an obscure shaded area, the water was freezing and it looked as though it had not been cleaned in a long time. Who wants to sit in the corner of a resort? The water slide was fun for the kids, but the resort lacks security. It was very obvious that people would come in from EPCOT or where ever for a swim or a slide that were not staying at the resort. The tagging is intermittent. The pool itself also needed some renovations, areas of chipping paint, roped off stagnant area, and many bare spots of the supposed sand bottom pool. Beach bar had a very friendly bartender, just ask for a floater on you frozen margarita (drinks very weak and sickeningly sweet) By the end of the week, he knew my husband my name and did give him a freebie. Beach grill food fair at best. Hair braiding girl was very nice. My girls loved that. But be prepared to shell out around $30.00 per braid! Word about the Polynesian Luau, don't bother. The best part of the show was the half way decent picture we got under the sunset! I have to mention the next item, because it was so bad, I was horrified! The valets at The Polynesian on the way out were all talking about a girl they had \"scored\" last night after they all got drunk and were throwing up, etc.... nice! They practically ignored us to outdo each others drunk tales until my husband finally said, would anyone mind getting our car please? Then they practically put their hand out for the tip.

If you can get a good deal, though, it is the best hotel we've stayed at on Disney property (we've stayed at 2 other \"deluxe\", 2 \"moderate\" and one \"value\"). We stayed there about 2.5 years ago. The convenience to Epcot cannot be overstated, even with small children. The pool is beyond compare. The room we had was fabulous -- even had two balconies (one you could barely stand on, but the other comfortably fit our family). The room was spacious and airy, well laid out, excellent housekeeping service. The corridor probably could have used some refurbishing, but how much time do you spend in the corridor? The layout of the hotel was a bit serpentine, but the lobby always had something interesting going on, the grounds were amazing and did I mention the pool? Our kids didn't even want to go to the parks!! It was also SO convenient to Epcot that while my littlest was napping, the older kids and I could walk over there just for an hour and see a show or make a mask or buy a snack, and it was so pleasant. The boat to MGM was also nice, and we had no problems with the bus service to the other parks. We did have to share with other resorts, but it only added an extra minute or two to the trip, unlike other trips where a deluxe has shared buses with two or three other resorts that weren't right next door. Having the entire Boardwalk area there is nice if you have been to the parks before and don't need to cram everything in, and just want to have some \"down\" time. We only ended up spending about half our time at the parks and thoroughly enjoyed the area -- our kids loved the Sandcastle Club (child care) so much, they begged to go back the next night. The only reason we have not been back is the price. I can't justify full price there when for half the price I can get another deluxe. Beach/Yacht Club seem to have fewer specials (AP or otherwise) compared to the others.

We've stayed here three times and love it. It is not the Ritz Carlton, and its not supposed to be. It is an unpretentious family hotel. Sure, the rates are Ritz Carlton like, but you are not paying for adult luxury. You are paying for the location and atmosphere. It's got a ton of that. For little kids, there is a great character breakfast every morning. And when we went at Christmas time, Mickey visited the lobby every morning. No waiting in long lines and the theme parks, you just play with him right there in your hotel. If your kids are 1 to 5, you couldn't ask for a better hotel pool. There is a sand beach and toddler pool with water that never gets above the chest of a toddler, and the plastic sand is clean, yet looks good and is fun to play with. For older kids, the rest of the pool has waterfalls, hot tubs, deep sections, and a waterpark caliber water slide. For the adults, at night, you have an excellent selection of restaurants within walking distance -- two in the beach club/yacht club, two on the boardwalk, and all of epcot, which has about ten good restaurants. If you want more restaurants, the Swan and Dolphin also have restaurants within walking distance. There are also bars and nightclubs on the boardwalk, a short walk away. The walk to epcot is about 200 yards. The walk to MGM is one mile on a nice walkway along the waterway (my preferred way of getting there) or a short boatrip. The bus trip to the Magic Kingdom takes a little longer, but hardly longer than the amount of time it takes to get from a car parked in the magic kingdom parking lot to the gate. This is a fabulous place to bring the family, don't let people's unrealistic expecations steer you away.

When we questioned them about it, they had no idea where they would be. And this was all within the first 4 hours that we arrived at the hotel. The next day my daughter had an ear infection. I asked how to get a perscription sent over. They were very nice in telling me how to get it delivered, but I needed a patient form faxed over to them, which they did not have. They told me I needed to find it maybe at another hotel. Why could they not have one faxed over from the company or another hotel. We had a room that over looked the \"quiet pool\", which is not quiet. The pool is to close at midnight, but there were people in there until 2:00 a.m. yelling and having fun. I called the front desk, but they did nothing about it. The worst thing was our neighbors. They came back at 3:00 a.m. fighting and drunk. She spent a half an hour pounding on the door of the room, which is not the hotels fault. We once again called the front desk. Nothing happened. She was finally got into the room and her and a man started yelling even louder. She started screaming for HELP, so we called the front desk again and then someone when up to quiet them down. They also called the police. Instead of removing them from the hall or their room, they talked with the people for an hour befor relocating them to another hotel in separate rooms.

We arrived in the \"off\" season and the hotel was hardly bustling, leaving one to think Disney would have no problem with this request. Wrong!!! I stressed that I had my elderly mother-in-law with us and the balcony was important to her, but they STILL smiled and assigned me a room with a standing-only balcony. It took some tenacity on my part to persuade the desk clerk to reassign us and - suprise! - they had full-balcony rooms available! It was all downhill after that. The location is still great and Stormalong Bay is still, well, Stormalong Bay, but the exceptional level of service that made Disney stand apart from other tourist destinations is clearly gone. We had just checked out of a hotel in Marco Island where the service was top-notch, so the difference was expecially acute.

We stayed at the Universal Portofino and Disney's Wilderness Lodge for our honeymoon in January and just this past wek we spent one night at the Universal Royal Pacific Bay hotel and seven nights at Disney's Beach lub resort. With that being said the Beach Club cost the most money and was our least favorite. Why stay at the Beach Club? My wife and I decided to stay here because we are suckers for Disney and loved the location of the resort. Our favorite Park is EPCOT and I like the Boardwalk. Both are within walking distance. I was also amazed at seeing what the pool, Stormalong Bay looked like. All of that is true. But here is what I did not know... 1) The transportation buses pick up guests at the Yacht Club before picking up guests at the Beach Club. This meant that we would get buses for the Magic Kingdom, Animal Kingdom and so on that were already almost full if not already full. We ended up driving to most of the parks because of this. 2) The constrution of the building seems very poor. Every morning we awoke to babies crying. I can sleep through most anything but this woke me up each and every morning. While walking through the halways you can hear people having conversations in all of the rooms. Thi did not make for a pleasant and relaxing stay. 3) I do not know if this is because of damage due to Hurricane Charley but there was a terrible smell of sewage in the hallway and outside of the resort. It smelled like garbage and raw fish!!! 4) They no longer check to see if you are a guest of the Yacht or Beach Club before swimming in the themed pool. And the pool was packed!!!! We were not able once to get a reclining chair by the pool. 5) The water is Hard!!! After sweating in the hot Florida sun all day there is nothing better then taking a shower. The problem here is that the water does not do much besides dry out your skin and hair. It made mine and my wifes hair feel like straw. So why two stars instead of none? Its still Disney. we enjoyed ourselves regardless. I enjoyed that unlike the Universal hotels that charge $15/day for use of the fitnes room it is included at the Beach Club. Valet parking was also half the price of the Universal Hotels. The view from our balcony was very nice, especially at night. We had a clear view of the Swan, Dolphin, and Boardwalk Hotels. What this all boils down to is that it was not worth the money!!! If this hotel cost $150/night that would be acceptable but for $345/night it is not acceptable at all. In fact it is getting ripped off!!! Plain and simple. Stay at the Wilderness Lodge. It will save you money and will be so much of a better experience. Heck, stay at an All Star Hotel. The rooms are almost the same size and I have stayed there 4 times and have never once heard anyone else. I hope this helps you make a good decision that will benefit you.

If you're a penny pincher stay elsewhere and leave the Beach Club for the more discriminating vacationer. If you're comparing properties, Beach Club is excellent, Yacht is essentially the same place with a better view of the Boardwalk (from the water view rooms) but further from Epcot (still walkable), Boarkwalk is also excellent (better than Yacht/Beach if you like nightlife), Swan and Dolphin also look nice. Next trip I think we might stay at The Polynesian. Tip: if you don't mind a little extra walking take the Monorail to Epcot from Magic Kingdom and walk back to Beach.
