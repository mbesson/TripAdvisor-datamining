It's also not that far of a walk down to the piers, it took us only about 20 minutes. The neighborhood didn't seem sketchy or bad and the hotel had cameras and you had to use your room key to get in the front door after a certain time. The view from the rooftop deck is quite nice if you manage to go up on a nice day.

Since we have moved away, I stayed at the Inn recently on a trip back to Seattle. For $84/night, you really can't beat that rate! The hotel is located on lower Queen Anne. Queen Anne is the neighborhood next to downtown Seattle, so a great, vibrant neighborhood close to everything. Easy access to I-5, a quick bus ride/walk/cab to downtown Seattle (less than 2 miles), a block from Key Area, and maybe only a mile to the Seattle waterfront. Queen Anne is divided into 2 neighborhoods - upper and lower Queen Anne. Both parts of \"the hill\" have great restaurants and cute shops, but lower Queen Anne has a younger, more urban vibe while upper Queen Anne is more residential. The hotel room was clean, service was friendly, but the hotel is relatively no frills. I may have a different opinion if I had visited the rooftop deck, which looks pretty amazing from the pictures on Trip Advisor. The window in my room looked into other rooms. It was a little disappointing that wi-fi was not free, as I feel like so many hotels offer free wi-fi now. I did really love the Starbucks access from the lobby - a true sign you're in Seattle! I believe parking was $15, and I recommend it, as parking is scarce since this hotel is so close to Key Arena and downtown. Some great places in the neighborhood are Peso's or Laredo's (both are Mexican restaurants with fun bars), The Great Nabob for a neighborhood bar with good local beer on tap, The Sitting Room for a cozy glass of wine and European-style hors d'oeuvres, and don't forget 2 Seattle institutions for casual dining - Pagliacci's Pizza and Dick's Drive-In hamburgers... both within a block of the Inn.", "Date": "March 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "misharpittman", "ReviewID": "UR125480796", "Content": "We arrived a little early but they went out of their way to let us check in early,parking in alley behind with secure gates and you use a card key to gain entry.The rooms are smaller but very clean and they have nice beds with Starbucks coffee and Tazo tea in the room and pop corn with bottled water.This hotel is decorated very nice and is very clean with a Starbucks adjacent to the lobby, Hey that must mean it is Seattle!!!!But the location is great to sight see and the bus system is available and lots of taxis everywhere so do not hesitate this place is GREAT.You can grab the monorail also but parking downtown can add up pretty fast so taking transit is a great option", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "NorthwestCoaster", "ReviewID": "UR125234375", "Content": "Two blocks away from Key Arena was the selling point for us to stay here.

When my partner flushed the toilet for the first time it was half a centimeter from overflowing filled with toilet paper. Rang the front desk to which I was informed that there was no \"maintence person\" on duty and that I could come down and get a plunger to plunge the toilet myself! I had to get dressed out of my pjs and go to the front lobby not one of the staff who was working at the time offered to come up and assist with the toilet and I had to ask if the toliet was not fixed could we swap rooms. They said they would swap us to another room, but as we were jet lagged and had already unpacked our things and stocked up the fridge with fruit and water it was not an option at that time of night. So I plunged and fixed the toilet myself and then had to walk down to return the plunger. In the morning I requested to speak to the manager to inform her of the situation but she was unavailable at the time. Staff were not sympathetic or apologetic to the situation until I requested to speak to the manager it was then that one of the employees apologized and as compensation wiped the Internet room fee of 4.95 so I now find the matter settled with the apology. But it does bring me to all the hidden costs, on arrival we were not informed of the rewards program in which you are charged for Internet, movies, to use the roof top access, use of the gym, coffee in the room ect. This all came to 8 dollars per day and it is written on a card that is left if your room. How ever this is very confusing and unclear I then took is card down to the lobby and even the girl at the desk agreed that it was confusing we were not getting charged this and most of the amenities on the card are free of charge such as accessing the roof and using the gym but the rest of it you do get charged for. I find it very confusing and unclear and I think the hotel need to clarify all is with guests when they arrive. The reason I rated this so low is the fact that I had to plunge the toilet myself, I had to ask twice before someone could look at the toilet and then someone only came and took a two second look the next evening!

This seemed ok & we were told our room would be ready by 12.30pm,come back then. On return at 2.pm we were told to wait, our room was not ready. 2 hrs later, after watching people check in, walk in off the street & get rooms, several visits to reception to enquire on our room, falling asleep in the foyer we were finally 'allowed to enter\". Would it have been so difficult for this hotel to change our room & give us a room already prepared. This hotel was clearly not full. To see others walk in off the street & go straight to a room was not a good first impression. Unfortunately airlines do not cater their flights to hotel check in times. Maybe its time hotels showed a little understanding towards those on long distance flights? Afterall we pay for it! And we go away informing others on our travels & at home as to how we are treated. This reflects not only on the hotel but on the city itself. My partner & I both felt the customer service for the duration of our stay (4 nights) was not only poor but quite rude. Listening to the conversations whist we were waiting a pattern started to emerge. American travellers were spoken/treated to in a cheerful, polite & helpful manner. international - sullen, unhelpful & unfriendly. On the plus side: room was large & clean. Bed was very comfortable & linen spotless. There was a kitchenette, though this did not supply any utensils - can cook in the microwave but need to visit the supermarket across the road to purchase said. Bathroom was clean but shower/water pressure poor. The rooftop view is lovely & a nice place to coffee/wine & nibble if warm enough. Starbucks can be accessed from the hotel foyer which is convienent. The noise in this hotel is incredible. Our room was in front of the elevators. All night we could hear the lifts moving & the doors opening/closing as well as other guests talking/yelling in the hallways. The walls are paper thin, we were distrubed by the guests upstairs & next door thumping around, everytime they used the toilet we could actually hear & even somone snoring. Traffic noise, buses/trucks early in the morning was awful. This was our first trip to Seattle. If i returned I would definately stay closer to the city. It is just too far out. Most of the sights are in the city area. There is a monorail to the Spaceneedle which we used, it is a short walk to the hotel from there. Buses are available but it seemed that we spent all our time in the city & could have just had a day looking around the Queen Ann area. Pike place market, Space needle & walking the waterfront are all worth doing. We caught the bus to Museum of Aviation. Locals assisted us to find right buses & the drivers were friendly & helpful. Museum was a highlight, this is really worth a look. We also visited the Gold Rush Museum & Fire Museum. Both worth a look if you are wandering around the city with no plans. Lovely staff ready to answer any questions. The Underground Tour was a little lame but we did enjoy due to the guides involved. Hilarious banter. These guides certainly made up for the lack of \"views' with their ability to spin a tale & interact with the group.

While I was aware of the rather stiff parking charge in advance, I justified the high room price as being due to the property's location.

It had been cleaned but it showed the stains. Just wear sandals or sox. There's no onsite restaurant, but as mentioned elsewhere, the area is full of walk-to choices. Noticed: -business center -gym -spacious and comfortable sitting area in lobby -beautiful Spartan rooftop deck with Adirondack chairs to loaf in and soak up the view. Bring your own drinks. -Starbucks on site with backdoor (from the hotel lobby) entrance. They've got a great deal for the active: for a small extra fee you can access bikes/helmets and all the other amenities for one charge. An hour on the bikes would cover the daily cost. Can't wait to go back.

The lobby area is impressive, the exterior pleasing, and the trendy lower Queen Anne neighborhood interesting (aka pricey). We arrived later after 9 hours of driving (8 pm) and found on a Wednesday night most of the recommended area restaurants/bars were packed: Toulouse Petit, 45 minute wait! When I booked the week before, I saw a $115 rate on expedia, called the hotel and asked for that rate. They \"gave\" it to me, claiming that was \"a very good deal.\" I thought so too at the time. The room was very basic and simple, clean, fairly small. Did not find bed that comfy. We overlooked a parking lot from the 2nd floor. The \"kitchenette\" was a coffee pot/fridge/micro. Being nearly 10 pm when we settled in, we discover-- NO AIR CONDITIONING!!! Now, the temps were fine for open (screened) windows, but the area is NOISY not just with traffic, but with partiers. Not conducive for peaceful sleeping with drunken shouts through the night. This hotel should make it CLEAR there is no A/C!!! (we had stayed in a quiet coastal Oregon town the previous night, where an open window and waves crashing at night was welcome). It IS a 4-5 minute walk to the Space Needle and monorail to midtown; but we hoofed it back from Pike's Market, and the hill climb is intense! Had restaurants in the QA area not been so packed, it would have been pleasant to hang in that area for meals. Slow elevators; but do take advantage of the roof view which is a plus point. Bill time: this is where the ugly truth comes out: even though my email reservation confirmation \"estimated room charges\" was $134, with energy/utility surcharge, guest benefits program, sales tax, hotel tax (the latter 2 charged twice), parking ($15), and more sales tax on parking, our stay was charged $161.55! To add insult to injury, we requested a later check out due to a late afternoon flight and were denied this. The only small \"accomodation\" made was to allow us to keep our car in the garage (a very low-slung, cramped, spooky space btw). If we had stayed longer, maybe having bikes to use, work out room, coffee, popcorn and water bottles (\"Guest Benefits Program\"-a mandatory charge) would be worth it; but we were very underwhelmed and overcharged by an otherwise decent hotel. All I'd say is they need to be more up front with those \"extra charges\" and no A/C. We've never been charged so much on taxes and surcharges (nearly $50 over base price).

This is my first visit to this hotel. As with all my reviews, I will go through as much as I can remember from the experience. Initial Thoughts: After hearing some positive reviews on Tripadvisor, I decided on taking the chance and checking out this hotel. As an added perk, this hotel was eligible under my THANKYOU points from expedia, which gave me FREE nights at this hotel. How can I not pick it? ;) My girlfriend and I arrived on the red eye flight from Los Angeles. Thank goodness for GPS. There are a lot of one way streets in Seattle. Arriving after midnight, the hotel exterior looked exactly like the pictures I saw online. When you try to park though, you might get confused because you have to check in first to get access to the parking garage behind the building. Parking cost $15/day. I have some gripes about the whole parking issue. First, the parking garage is very TIGHT. I luckily had a Prius and was able to navigate that car in the super tight spots in the garage. Second, if I\u2019m paying $15/day for parking, I should be able to find a spot easy, not having to HOPE or WISH for a spot to be open. Other then that, parking was fine. They have security camera\u2019s watching the garage and I actually saw one employee checking for valid parking tags. The Grounds: Not so much real estate here. Lobby is nice and simple. Clean. Nice to know that Starbucks is connected directly next to the lobby. There\u2019s a gym also near the lobby. I didn\u2019t have a chance to go to the upper balcony for a view, but I heard it was nice up there. Seattle Center was walking distance. You can see the space needle from the hotel. The Room: Do not expect an extravagant room or anything. The room was good enough for two people. Standard size room. Everything was neat and tidy. Did not have any issues with the room being dirty. Bathroom was clean as well. The room we were assigned to was on the 2nd floor, facing the busy street. If you have a chance to get a room at the upper floors, I would say do so. Staying on this floor and location on a Friday night means hearing the intoxicated people walk just right outside your room. This can be very annoying if you\u2019re trying to get a good night\u2019s rest before you start your day the next morning. I was surprised to see a flat LCD TV in the room. That was a nice touch. The bed was ok, not too hard, not too soft. The room also didn\u2019t come with AC, but I guess you wouldn\u2019t need it that much because open your windows and you\u2019ll feel that breeze come in. The little kitchenette in the room was convenient as well. You can buy some groceries by the near by SAFEWAY and keep some food in the fridge. The Food: Did not get any food at the hotel. Go outside and visit Seattle. All the food will be out there waiting for you. The Staff: Staff was friendly and attentive. Didn\u2019t have too much contact with them. Only for checking in and out of the hotel. Summary: For the super price of FREEDOLLARS and location, I would recommend this hotel if anyone is staying in Seattle.

A cab is always waiting outside the hotel should you need a ride, Safeway is across one street and a local hamburger legend (Dicks) across another, not to mention a nearby cross town bus, post office, dozens of restaurants, a movie theater, etc. The location simply cannot be beat. The Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel is also a plus as it is open early and closes late for more snack time.

It has been lovingly remodeled in warm yellows and browns, and shows obvious care. Unfortunately, it still retains a couple of the negatives from its former life. Rooms are smaller than most (except the corner queen suites, which are large and beautiful), and there can be a residual smoke odor. The hotel is completely non-smoking, but smells as if it didn't use to be. It's not a quiet place, and you may be able to hear the baby crying in the next room (we did). The positives include very comfortable beds, flat-screen TVs, and excellent staff. They are top-notch, especially Guadalupe, who seemed to bend over backwards for every guest. Amanda was nice, but a \"loud talker\". I didn't see more than two people on duty at a time. They were busy, but appeared to be in control. There is underground parking for $15/day. A very large and well-equipped business center, plus two computers in the lobby for quick use. Starbucks is accessible through the lobby. A decent fitness room is on the bottom floor, along with a laundromat and snack room. The front door is secured at night, accessible only by key. The Med rents rooms by the night, week, or month. A furnished studio for a month is $1065, less than most rents in the area. Safeway is half a block away; Dick's burgers across the street.

There were some small cosmetic issues with the room, but nothing that compromised safety or comfort. Our only complaint was that our window didn't close properly.

Everyone was helpful, efficient, and friendly. The next day we walked downstairs to grab coffe, then to the Seattle Center to take the monorail to downtown. It was a bonus that parking at the hotel was only $15, so we were able to leave the car there. We chose to park on the street at night (free), right in front of the hotel.

We visited the Seattle Center in the morning and then hopped on the monorail to downtown. From the monorail depot downtown it's only a 4 block walk to Pike's Place Market.

The hotel itself is in the Queen Anne neighborhood which has great restaurants and shopping. It's got a small town feel in the heart of a big city. Hotel: In the lobby, the hotel has framed reviews from various publications and one states something like, \"the hotel won't win any design awards.\" It's true...but who cares. The place is spotless and the rooms are spacious and come with the added benefit of a small kitchenette. Not sure if the kitchenette is in every room but we had one in our king room. Since we were traveling with a small baby, the kitchenette was great to have. If the weather permits, there is a great roof deck with sweeping views of Queen Anne Hill, downtown and the Space Needle. My only complaint - the rooms are all equipped with VCR's. We had travelled with a number of DVD's to keep the baby occupied and it would have been nice to play them. Plus, there is a Blockbuster Video across the street and it would have been nice to rent DVD's if needed. I guess this is more of a suggestion than a complaint. Service: The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Our room was not ready at the time of our arrival but they were able to move us to another room at no additional charge.

When we were finally able to get into our rooms we found that they were clean and nice but not glamorous in any way but that was fine because we knew it was a small hotel. What we did not know,however, was that only 20% of the facility was air conditioned. Since I am asthmatic air conditioning is generally a must for me. To my dismay I could not get a room with air because the hotel was fully booked due to the LSU/Washington State Univ game and the Jazz Concert, etc. but I was switched to a room with better ventilation and in a location that was not over the street so I would not be subjected to auto fumes. The remainder of our stay was great! The staff gave us directions, made suggestions and even arranged for tranportation when needed. We had unlimited free computer use and exercise facility use. The hotel was located within walking distance of the Space Needle, monorail andmany other attractions. It was on the bus line and near enough to Pike's Market for those who like to walk. Our group agreed that we could not have made a better choice of places to stay and whenever we return to Seattle we will stay at The Mediterranean Inn again.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "MI", "Title": "\u201cBest view in town.\u201d", "Author": "4HANDSMi", "ReviewID": "UR46427156", "Content": "View from roof is better than from Space Needle because it includes the Space Needle (only blocks away).

Clean, good shower, dated decor & vcr system (though tapes are availble to watch & my English dvds wouldn't work there anyway). Having a kitchenette in the room is a HUGE help as a gluten/dairy/meat free traveller, and having a Safeway across the road means food is always readily available and reasonable. There is also a cinema across the road, & the hotel is situated one block from key arena which hosts music events and basketball... There are 2 computers for quick use in the lobby, (you have to stand to use them) but there is also a 'Business Center' (not exclusive for business customers use) where you can sit for longer periods. A small exercise room stores the stacks of leaflets on things to see & do-if you want ideas (I discovered these on my last day!) but you shouldn't need them as Seattle is such a great city & there is plenty going on if you just walk into town & look around. The centre of town *is* a bus ride away, (fares $1.75 tickets valid for 2 hours) but you can always use the monorail for two bucks more (return) & this gives you reason to walk into the wonderful Seattle Centre each day, host of the Experience Music Project, The Fountain Dome, & of course the Space Needle-(aswell as many other delights!) I was particularly keen on checking out live music while I was in town, and the reception staff were sooo helpful, looking things up for me while I ran errands or was out sight seeing, we have kept in touch! I would definately stay here again, it's just the right amount of home you need, and an excellent, safe base to explore this wonderful city. One more thing-Fabulous view on the roof top terrace.

Some folks might consider the room small but personally I dislike the yawning spaces in some hotels -- this felt like a well-appointed guest room in a private home. Beds were comfortable with silky smooth cotton sheets, vellux blankets and plump pillows. The little kichenette with microwave, fridge and sink would make it great for an extended stay and the desk was a good size with a comfortable chair. I liked the TV being atop a tall dresser -- made it easier to watch in bed. Though it was somewhat warm while I was there (low 80's during the day, 60's at night) I was happy to crank open the large windows that looked out on the interior terrace, sort of a large light shaft in the center of the building. That and the ceiling fan kept it comfortable and I much preferred it to the clammy, musty chill of the usual hotel AC units. I didn't mind at all not having an outside view because I could easily go up to the 7th floor roof deck and sit in the Adirondack chairs with a 360 degree panorama of Puget Sound, the mountains, the nearby Space Needle and all of the city center spread out beyong -- what a terrific view, day or night! Take your breakfast up there! The parking garage was very handy and reasonably priced considering the going rate at the city lots. Public transport was nearby and you could walk to some shopping and restaurants (I had dinner at an Italian bistro around the corner that was sublime). It was only a 5 minute drive to the city center and very easy access to the central parkway of Route 5.

Booked the hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and I must say it was as good as we hoped it would be. As we were traveling with our 20 month old toddler, we really wanted to stay somewhere central and clean. Mediterranean Inn had everything we need. From a sink to wash dirty cups to a microwave to heat up milk and fridge, we were glad with the amenities. I remembered reading some reviews saying not to stay in the rooms next to the street, so I called in advance to reserve a room on a higher floor and away from the street level. That was helpful as we were on the fifth floor with a slight view of the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound. It was quiet and we were able to get a good night rest. The only thing that I wished the hotel provided were plates/bowls and utensils and of course dishwashing liquid for us to wash stuff (maybe a small packet of cleaning supplies?). The bathroom was alright though I wished the water power from the showerhead would be stronger. And also, it would really be nice if the quality of the toilet paper was better. But like many have commented, this is not a luxury hotel, but it was perfect for our weekend stay in Seattle. Two things that I really liked about the Inn is its proximity to Safeway (just opposite). It made it so easy for us to drop by the supermarket on the way back to the hotel to pick up milk, snacks, stuff for our son. Another plus is having Starbucks in the lobby. The smell of fresh coffee as you walk into the lobby is priceless. The first morning we were there, I woke up extra early, bought myself a caramel macchiato from Starbucks and went to the rooftop to catch the sunrise. It was perfect. Some good places for food around the inn include Phuket, a small Thai restaurant just across the street on Queen Anne Ave. Not a lot of choices but food is relatively tasty and reasonably priced. We also tried Roti, an Indian restaurant just a little further down Queen Anne Ave across the street and its amazing! One good tip for those coming from the airport would be to call the inn the day before and get their personal car service to pick you up. Its a $35 flat rate.

We were able to take buses to other points, such as Pike Place Market (though this is walkable if you like long walks). Free internet access in the lobby helped us plan our sightseeing.

The hotel also had 2 computers set up with the internet, for guests to use w/o a reservation, and then they also had a business room with more computers and printers. The access to the internet was very helpful, when trying to find new things to do and to check email away from home. The hotel is centrally located.

We stayed on the 6th floor and had a nice view of the lake, as well as the Space Needle (if we looked out towards the left). We took advantage of the outlook on the roof, on our first night (when it was dry) to look out at the beautiful city. As we all know, people that live in Seattle drink a lot of coffee, so there is a Starbucks on the lobby level of the hotel. We did not go to that Starbucks, but it was nice to know it was there. The only quirks that the hotel had was the parking fee and the bed. The hotel charges $12.00 a day for guests to park in the garage.
