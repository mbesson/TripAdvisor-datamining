As it was only for one night and was clearly a budget hotel, our expectations were not high. Unfortunately, however, even these minimal expectations were not really met. Although the rooms were clean and (very) basically furnished, our room was so small that the words 'swing' and 'cat' spring to mind - it was really little more than a cupboard with a double bed crammed into it. The bed was also quite small; I would be surprised if it was even standard double size. Neither of these things would have been a problem per se, although I would certainly say that staying here for any longer than a night would quickly become very uncomfortable and fairly depressing. The main problem with our stay was the level of noise, which was more or less continuous throughout the night. The worst incident of this was when a group of young men gathered in the smoking area (immediately outside our bedroom window) and loudly talked and laughed for a long time in the middle of the night. Needless to say this, combined with the continuous background noise of doors slamming, people talking etc, meant that my partner and I got very little sleep last night. In my opinion this hotel is not worth the \u00a364 we paid for it - if you're looking for a budget hotel in this price range I would definitely suggest sticking to a Travelodge or Premiere Inn type establishment which, whilst basic, at least seem to be of a consistent standard.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silver Spring, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cVery friendly and good location to Tube\u201d", "Author": "Kirsy1", "ReviewID": "UR115294624", "Content": "We really enjoyed our stay.

Downstairs was very shabby- a definite turn off and the kitchen which was in the basement, was shared by guests. People can cook for themselves and can make complimentary use of eggs, bread and milk. It seems a generous and great idea, but the reality of cooking with other residents of all kinds wasn't practical or inviting. I can't imagine hygiene is great, so we gave that a very wide berth. Fortunately, the bedroom was clean and tidy, though sparsely furnished. The shower was efficient. We found the toilet wouldn't flush- we had to lift off the lid and push down on the 'controls' inside. Also the plug wouldn't work, but rather than have someone coming into our room, we reported both on departure.

The room was small \u2013 but not stiflingly so. The bathroom was larger than some we\u2019ve seen in our journeys throughout the UK and on the continent and the shower just missed winning the \u201cbest shower\u201d award because it could have used a shower wand head rather than a fixed position nozzle \u2013 the water pressure and temperature was great though. The bed was very comfortable and we even had enough plugs for our electronic equipment in the room \u2013 no easy task and one that most rooms fail. The room was a bit hot even with the furnace off but we were happy to use the supplied fan to cool it down. We were gone from very early to very late in the evening and so we did not use the available kitchen very often but when we did we found it perfect \u2013 with everything necessary supplied and the free bananas, cereal, and toast in the mornings were fantastic.

We also loved the fast and free wifi access that we easily reached from our room and were happy to find that the hotel actually set-up multiple routers to ensure connectivity. Our room was cleaned thoroughly every other day which was perfect for us because I don\u2019t believe it is necessary more frequently and is just a waste of time, money, and energy. We also loved the location \u2013 on a major street in between the Bow Road underground stop (about two blocks away and accessible by the District Line and Hammersmith & City lines) and the Bow Church light rail station right next door. Our room was on the interior of the hotel and away from the street, so we had no street or light rail noise.

Hotel rooms in a basement are just unconceivable to us. All the more so as there was no mention of such conditions on the website or of a difference in price for upper-level and underground rooms. The \"double bed\" was so small that it was really not for two, and one continuously feared falling from it. The bathroom was clean, but there was no shelf or other possibilty to place anything.
