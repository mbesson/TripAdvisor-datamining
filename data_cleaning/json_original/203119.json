There are plenty of restaurants and facilities nearby. The staff were friendly, coherent, and made things really easy for us. An example is on the last day when we had to leave very early to catch our flight, the staff offered to make us breakfast before the area opened. The breakfast was decent enough, some of the bread was a bit tough but perfectly acceptable. The hotel is immaculate inside and was really impressive, with nice d\u00e9cor which is easy on the eye. The room was a decent size, if a bit dark even with all the lights on. Things I didn\u2019t like so much; the TV was really small and the view from our window overlooked pipes and generators.

This was based on a recommendation of our travel agent due to it's central location. Safe to say we will be having words with him when we return!! Both my husband and I have done a lot of travelling and this was easily the worst hotel we have ever stayed and definitely the worst customer service we have ever experienced.\u00a0 Firstly the rooms are a shoebox with a tv which is even smaller! The hairdryer in our room did not work and when we called to ask for another one they said we could come down ourselves and get it (no offer to bring it up to us). The bathroom is so small that you have to sit diagonally to go to the toilet. However the worst part is the bed! The bed is two single beds pushed togeher which are of very poor quality and very uncomfortable. The bed was so bad that my husband woke up with a migraine due to his neck being out.\u00a0 On this basis we attempted to check out and get a refund for the second night that we had\u00a0already paid. This request was met with absolute distain by the front desk. We were advised that it was my \"husbands perception\" that the bed was bad and that in fact they had people ask them for the company who make the mattresses so they can contact them directly and praise them (not a chance). The main lady at the front desk was so rude to the point that she was yelling at us after we requested our money back. We were told that we would not be getting our money back but they could move us to another room. When we asked if it would be the same bed, she replied \"of course\". After two other staff members came out the front to have a go at us as well, we decided to forfeit the second nights payment and just cut our losses and not ruin our honeymoon. They basically shooed us out the door.\u00a0 Worst hotel, worst customer service and worst experience of our 4 week honeymoon. We also lost half a day in Rome due to my husband's migraine and his back played up for the rest of the trip. We then walked across the road to the 4 star hotel \"Hotel Morgana\" who were only $15 euro extra per night, who were excellent and made the rest of our stay in Rome thoroughly enjoyable.\u00a0 Please take our advice - do not stay here!", "Date": "April 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWell run and central location\u201d", "Author": "CarolGeary", "ReviewID": "UR127403837", "Content": "Very helpful staff, clean hotel with a good continental breakfast.

Worse yet, I had all my directions mapped from this hotel, and I felt like it would be hard for me to figure it out from another hotel. Someone from Hotel Kennedy offered to walk me to my \"new\" hotel. He nearly ran though, so I had to run to keep up with him. Running on the uneven cobble stone made me twist my ankle. I screamed in pain. He barely stopped to wait for me while I hobbled along to the other hotel. This was a horrible greeting to Rome! The new hotel wasn't nice, and I felt the whole thing was a bait and switch. I think they gave my room to someone staying longer or paying a higher price.

It was offered as part of a deal with British Airways and ended up being good value for money but nothing more than that. The location is great, almost right next to Termini station and within easy walking distance to the city centre, Republica is 5mins walk, further into the centre approximately 30mins but a reasonable nice walk. Be aware that is very dark around the streets of the hotel at night and you can bump into the odd prostitute as it is near the main trainstation. Also, you can get to the Vatican or other areas easily by underground from Termini Station. The hotel is very clean and good maintained. We were not impressed by the staff, not sure if it is a cultural thing or just not interested in providing the best service to the customer, but we didnt feel welcomed at any point. Answers to our questions where given in a rather abrupt and rude way. I am inclined to put that towards the potential language barrier but most staff seemed fluent in English. The other downside was the breakfast, as it was described as very good in most reviews on here, it didnt offer much that would actually want you to get out of bed in the morning to be honest. If you are looking to have a healthy breakfast, look elsewhere. All on offer were pastries, rolls and a selection of cream cheeses as well as plasterboard like cereals and fruits out of a tin. Overall the breakfast just felt very 'lean and mean' in approach and to me this is one of the key points to get right at a hotel. Not impressed. With regards to the rooms, they were very clean apart from the wall finishes, but the beds felt more like waterbeds, very bouncy and gave me backache in the morning. The final point is noise. Even though we had a 'quiet' room to the rear, the acoustics within the hotel are appalling. The cleaners slammed doors in the morning and guests with kids were screaming throughout the evenings. So if you are looking for a great location, clean and affordable this is a good bet, but if you are looking for a little bit of sleep and a nice breakfast, stay elsewhere!

The kennedy hotel was quite easy to find and close to the rome central train terminal which was very handy as we arrived via train and could walk no more than 5 minutes to the hotel and check in. Check in was fine but i did find the gentleman slightly abrupt, he simply handed me the key and a fist full of maps not personally offering me any information about my room, my breakfast that was included or information on the area which i had come to expect after staying in many 3 star hotels across europe and italy during my vacation. When we located our room we were quite disappointed with what we found. - The room was very run down, there were dozens of black marks all across the walls of the room and across the hotel upon later wandering around the hotel, it was clear that the room and hotel was in need of some serious maintenance. - There was a large black foot print on the ceiling above the bed, as well as numerous black marks and a hole about 5 centimeters in diameter. - The smoke detecter in our room was not working and this was quite concerning to us as you had to dead lock yourself in the room at night with a key just to simply to lock the door, no electronic key which is quite standard these days. - The first night stay in the room was horrible to say the least!! The smell from the air-conditioner which runs through all the rooms of the hotel absolutely stank of cigarette smoke which was foul. We had to sleep with the window open and the air-con turned off just to have some clean air, and unfortunately because of having the window open the noise from the very busy street below kept us awake all night. The following morning we asked the gentleman at the front desk if it was possible to change rooms because of the noise from the street and we were informed that he would \"see what he could do\". Absolutely nothing came from this request and when we later approached the front desk the following day another gentleman said there was no mention of this request and we could not change rooms. - The television was a tiny 20cm black box that on our first night had 11 viewable channels and by the second night there were 2 with all the rest with a terrible broken signal. Upon leaving the hotel to explore rome we informed front desk of the problem with the television and he assured us that he would look into the problem. Once again it appeared that we were completely ignored as the room and television was undisturbed and we had 2 channels the rest of the stay!! - The Continental breakfast which was included in our room rate was extremely disappointing to say the least! The meal consisted of: - Stale Croissants. - Bread Rolls (with no facilities to toast bread or the rolls, not that any bread was available anyway) - Canned mixed fruit in syrup. - Yoghurt - Cream Cheese and jam - Stale Cakes and coffee. - Cereal In my 4 weeks of touring europe and staying in all 3 star properties this was the only breakfast that was well below standard. On my last day in rome i politely asked the gentleman on front desk if he could please make a phone call on my behalf to confirm a pre booked transfer to the rome airport. The reason i requested this from the gentleman at the front desk was simply because of the italian language barrier. I was ruddily advised that because i had not booked it through the hotel they would not help me and told me to dial \"0\" from the telephone in my room to make an outside call. The call cost 50 cents as it was only a local call which i would have been more than happy to pay to the gentleman on front desk. Overall my experience at the Kennedy Hotel in rome was appalling. The men on the front desk were extremely rude, arrogant and far from helpful, even the simplest request was ignored or refused. Every other hotel that we stayed in on this trip went above and beyond our expectations of 3 star accommodation except this one. It absolutely fell very short and I would think that it should be a 2 star property. My only positive remark was that it did have clean sheets, towels and the room was always neat and tidy (except for the extreme need for maintenance and a coat of paint). Therefore the only person doing their job within the hotel was the maid.

Once arrived, one may have the impression of an unsafe area around the Termini Station especially during the late evenings and nights, but as time goes by you will notice that this is not the case. The area is full of restaurants placing tables outside which means that the area is quite populated until midnight, especially with tourists. Tip: if you need metro line A, then avoid going to Termini as the way to the platforms is a nightmare (lots of modernization works, deviations, crowds of people, etc) \u2013 so I would advice going to Vittorio Emmanuele, few blocks behind the hotel. Reception guys: The guys were very friendly, polite and ready to help you with any advice. Don\u2019t be surprised whether they will charge you with an additional 2 euro/ person/night capped at 20 euro/person (i.e. if you stay mote than 10 nights, 20 euro is maximum charge) as per a recently enacted local law, although on my reservation it was clearly stated \u201call taxes and local charges covered\u201d. This local tax is to help preserving the Roman monuments, museums, etc. Room: The room was at the first floor, being quoted \u201csuperior\u201d \u2013 was I given it because I stayed 11 nights? Comparing with rooms from other Italian hotels I stayed, this was really modern, large enough. The floor was covered with sand stone, air conditioning worked perfectly, furniture wasn\u2019t too old, TV set was somehow old, but in good shape, as expected no balcony at all. Bathroom was quite ok, in good condition, but no outside window which determined the occurrence of some little mould spots on the ceiling above the shower (no bath). There was hot water all the time. Breakfast: Breakfast was practically the same every morning, rather not diverse, but cannot complain. Milk and cereals, sweets, few fruits and some yellow cheese. Try all coffees they serve, they can prepare it in different ways.

We chose the hotel partly due to its convenient location for the railway station and that we could leave our bags at the hotel after check-out rather than carrying them around, sightseeing. We arrived at midday and were delighted that our rooms were already prepared for us. We'd booked a family room some months before, but on arrival were told that they'd run out of family rooms. Instead we were given two double rooms next to each other in a corner of the hotel (122 and 124). As our son is 12, that wasn't a problem. Our double room was very large, while the other was very small, with the double bed against one wall, and the chair and desk squeezed in at the foot of the bed. Air-conditioning worked well and our rooms faced the back of the hotel, so were quiet if we chose to open the windows instead. The beds were comfortable and we all had a good night's sleep. The bathrooms were very small (how anyone overweight could sit on the toilet, I don't know!) and I wasn't totally confident about their cleanliness, although it may just have been that they were in need of refurbishment. Can recommend the atmospheric Gallo Matto Italian restaurant just 5 minute walk away for a lovely, and inexpensive, Italian evening meal. Breakfast wasn't up to much at the Kennedy. Coffee was nice. There was a small choice of cereals, plus some coissants. The only fruit was some apples and oranges, and there were some yogurts. We'd been enjoying the cold buffet breakfasts in our hotel in Sorrento, but this was not a patch on the breakfasts there and we were glad we were staying just the one night.", "Date": "August 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWell located\u201d", "Author": "Joel205", "ReviewID": "UR116793877", "Content": "Close to train station and transport.

I must admit, its location has its advantages: after hopping off the Leonardo Express from Fiumicino, it's a very short walk to get to the hotel. You'll be able to check right in, take the elevator and jump right into bed should you want to. Another advantage is the nearby Conad supermarket, open from 6 AM untill midnight. It's a basic european supermarket, enabling you to buy decent food at a decent price. The rooms at the Kennedy are very basic, however. The bathroom in 201 was very tiny, and could have used a few extra square meters for comfort. The bed was okay, and a closet with two shelves at the bottom was provided. Rome can get very hot in the summers, so luckily air conditioning is provided. For those interested: the TV offers CNN, BBC World and a variety of Italian channels. There are no extra services at the hotel, no bar you can sit at, gym or sauna. There's a small waiting room at the back of the reception desk, but it's not very inviting and not very comfortable. The breakfast is downright awful. Seriously, skip breakfast and eat it somewhere else. As for the idea that being close to Termini is a good thing due to all the transport connections: it's a plus, but merely a tiny one. Rome isn't that big. What looked like a huge walk on the map is only a fifteen minute stroll (for example: walking from colosseo to the Victor Emanuelle II monument). Also, Rome only has 2 metro lines, A and B (with C under construction). Sights like Piazza Navona and the Pantheon aren't anywhere near a metro stop. I seriously recommend taking the bus - busses are included in your metro ticket. The transportation advantage is only minor. My next visit in Rome will be in a more romantic area, in the center of Rome and probably not near Termini. Not that it's an unsafe or unpleasant neighbourhood, it's just not really an advantage over other options. The overall feeling I had was that this the Kennedy Hotel could be so much more. I expected more for the price I payed. It's not a bad hotel, but it's not a good one either.

The breakfast was the continental style of warm fresh bread cheeses meats yogurt and very wierd but how lovely, slices of cheese cake and chocolate cake! with steam cream coffee and fresh pots of tea brought to the table. I cannot fault the hotel one bit. The staff were polite and if we wanted room service they came in a flash even at midnight when we fancied a bottle of wine! The breakfast was great with plenty of choice and spotless rooms its a must stay place at only \u00a350 a night its perfect for a romantic getaway. Rome is the most amazing place i have EVER been and i would recommend going to Rome for a long weekend to ANY couple!!!!

There are plenty of other hotels in Rome which are probably better in terms of quality and price. When we arrived at the hotel, the front desk clerk quickly urged my boyfriend to sign some papers without consulting their material. He ushered us into a lobby, where we left our things and then we headed out to explore Rome as the room wasnt ready until 2. This hotel was situated right near the Termini station, where all the buses and trains are. This was the only advantage of staying at this particular hotel. Otherwise, the \"superior\" room was small and we were told that ALL the rooms in the hotel are extremely small. The bathroom in the room is probably the nicest part of the room. It seems newly redone and very clean, and the multiple shower heads have lots of pressure. The air conditioning in the room is centrally controlled throughout the hotel which doesnt cater to Rome's heat in the summer, and the bed was a bit rough. After requesting a room with a nice view, the room we received (#90), was on the first floor and had a terrible view. We faced a line-up of dumpsters and a park in renovation. At around 11, some truck came and emptied the garbage and it made a lot of noise. When we asked for another room, the front desk clerk offered no help and was rude about it, saying that we should not expect North American standards here. The breakfast at the hotel was mediocre and included a \"variety of jams\", glazed croissants, some bread, cereal and yogurt. It wasn't great, but it helped to start off the morning. If youre looking for service and quality for an affordable price, stick to franchised hotels as Italian privately owned hotels (particularily this one) are small and lack amenities such as a blow dryer.

I was looking for somewhere romantic in europe where I could take my girlfriend as a surprise for her birthday. plus the fact that I was planning to propose to her whilst i was there. I booked our flights to Rome through British Airways (they are doing great deals on flights from gatwick at the moment!) and their website recommended the hotel Kennedy as one of their hotels, giving it a solid rating for a 3 star at a great price. (I paid \u00a3160 for the 3 nights.) Before I booked it, I came on this site and a few others to read reviews about the hotel and was slightly un-nerved by some of the comments. still, undeterred by the \"few\" poor reviews i decided to go with the majority of the good comments and book the hotel for 3 nights. We arrived at Fiumicino airport in the early afternoon, collected our bags and easily followed the signs to the train station to catch the train to Rome Termini (it cost 22 euros for the both of us and lasted about 40 minutes) Having arrived at Rome Termini we set off walking to the hotel which was no more than 5 minutes away and was really easy to find. (You can catch the subway, from the Termini, to anywhere you like in Rome for 4 Euros. this is valid all day no matter how many times you hop on and off) We entered the hotel behind an elderly couple. (Who were being helped with their bags up the 5 or 6 steps by the receptionist guy) The reception area was small but cosy with various maps and tourist information for guests. We quickly had our documentation checked, given our room key and was in our room within 10 mins. The room wasn't huge but it had everything we needed for our stay. It was very clean, well presented with a comfy double bed, big wardrobes, a T.V. (with MTV, CNN and BBC World being the only english stations. But why would you want to watch T.V. when your in ROME???) The bathroom made very good use of its size and had a good size shower. The complimentary bathroom supplies were limited to soap and a shower cap. (which i must say, i did look rather fetching in!! :o) ) So bring your own shampoo and toiletries! Breakfast was continental. croissants, cerial, morning cakes, juice, tea and coffee. just enough to set you up for the day. The staff there were very friendly and happy to help with any queries my girlfriend or I had. I even emailed the hotel before our arrival telling them of my plans to propose and asking them if they had any ideas of where the best place to do it. I got a very prompt and nice reply from a lady called Alexia that works there who informed me of some very nice restaurants that she and her husband had been to. One being the Consolini. Which i booked through the receptionist while we were there. This was a little out of the way and off the tourist area which is what i wanted as it added to the romance. The food was fantastic but the service wasn't very good. The staff seemed to tend to the Italians before eventually come to us. Not sure if it was anything to do with us being tourists or not but it seemed like it. My advice would be to stick to the restaurants around the hotel. the food is just as good and at around half the price that i there. The area around the hotel is very misleading, after reading the comments on this site about how poor the area is i was very dubious about walking around at night. it really isn't as bad as first thought. granted, the streets aren't paved with gold but after braving it out we both felt very comfortable walking around. You just have to bear in mind that although it may be one of the richest cities in the world with all its \"treasures\" there are still a lot of poor and homeless people. this is aparent nomatter where you go. The traffic on the streets around Rome are very hard to get used to and if you're waiting for a break in the traffic before crossing then you'll be waiting a long time. You have to apply what i call \"the Moses effect!\" Like Moses and the \"parting of the waves\" you have to literally step out in front of the cars. it sound completely insane but if you step out into the road (still using caution though) the cars will magically part and let you past!! If you're not confident then just wait for an Italian to do it and see what happens. or just follow them. I finally asked my girlfriend to marry me whilst out on a walk at night after our meal. we went and sat at the side of the Colesseum (which looked amazing all lit up!) and I proposed to her there, and i am glad to say she said YES!!! I wanted it to be something she would never forget and hopefully she wont. (its not hard though because anywhere in Rome would have been equally romantic as it is such a beautiful city.) If you're looking at a hotel where you can be \"wined and dined\" then this is not the place for you, but if you want a clean, friendly, inexpensive place to lay your head when you are not looking at the wonderous sights in this fantastic city then i would recommend this hotel to absolutely everyone. Especially with the subway being so close to access virtuall anywhere in Rome. All in all our experience of Rome was a truely unforgettable one and one that was made all the more special by Alexia and the staff at the hotel kennedy. Many thanks to you all.

The Colosseum is a good ten minute walk away - we walked to all the sites in our time but the Vatican may be worth getting a Metro line A train and then just walking back taking in various sites depending on the route you choose.Piazza Navona was a bit over rated in the guide books in my opinion - also the Palatine was likewise - otherwise worth a look at are the Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps,The Santa Maria Maggiore Church, The Pantheon, The Colosseum,The Roman Forum area and the Papal Tombs at the Vatican + St Peter's Square - all these are free admission except the Colosseum which at the time of our visit cost 11 Euros each and we queued for nearly 30 minutes at 10.30 am on a Thursday to get in.", "Date": "September 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cUgh.\u201d", "Author": "Tuckerson", "ReviewID": "UR5458816", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Kennedy Hotel for three nights during our honeymoon last month. Although we were certainly not expecting the same luxury of our hotel on the Amalfi Coast, we were extremely disappointed when we arrived. If the Kennedy Hotel is three stars, then I would really hate to see a one-star, especially given what we were paying for the room. The neighborhood, although very convenient to the Termini Station, was quite far from all of the attractions. We walked everywhere (although we took taxis after dark because we were so uncomfortable walking through the area around the hotel), but it was definitely a hike. Upon entering the hotel, we had to drag all of our luggage up a staircase to check in. The lobby was tiny and dingy. The desk staff was pleasant enough, but not able to offer things like an extra pillow upon request. In our room, the beds were two twins pushed together, with a comforter that looked like it had seen much better days. There was a single bare flourescent light strip over the bed. The bathroom was tiny, and the shower had a major drainage problem. The water tempature in the shower tended to go unexpectedly from scalding to freezing. The toiletries were extremely minimal, and there was not so much as a soap dish in the shower stall...we ended up having to use a plastic cup. The airconditioner kept the room from being stifling, but it was definitely not cool. There was a plastic bucket underneath it where it was dripping, which we had to empty several times. Our view was of an alley, and we could hear street traffic all night. We checked out the continental breakfast but decided to find our own meal instead. Overall, I would absolutely not stay in this hotel again, nor would I recommend it to others. Had I known what we were getting, I would definitely have coughed up the extra money to stay in a safer, more central location with better facilities. In fact, were it not for the fact that the room was required to be prepaid and they would not give us any refund whatsoever, we would have checked out after our first night.", "Date": "July 12, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Palm Beach", "Title": "\u201cKennedy Hotel is OK\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5420751", "Content": "We spent 6 nights at the Kennedy Hotel and I concur with most of the reviews previously written here. Since we arrived before check-in, we only had to wait about 15-20 minutes for our room (and yes, you do have to roll your luggage up a couple of steps to reach the reception area, and you are required to immediately pay for at least a few nights of your trip while you check-in, and the elevator is narrow). The reception staff was very nice to us on a daily basis (they do hold your room key for you when you go out). Our \"superior\" room was on the fifth floor. It was comfortable, cool (a/c worked fine), quiet (the double paned windows do help), clean (maid service is VERY GOOD), beds were comfortable too (altho they were two twin beds pushed together). The bathroom was very nice (shower stall with rain showerhead, bidet, toilet, sink) but very small and minimal toiletries provided. Two people could not comfortably be in there at the same time as well. Upon opening the bathroom door, it would hit side of the bidet. There was no safe in the room either. We left things locked in our suitcase and on the first day, we left change out on a table for the maid which she did not touched (so staff is extremely honest & secure-wise). Our room had a strange slanted ceiling which gave us the feeling we were staying in an attic which was a tad disconcerting. We also had no view to speak of (overlooked the side of working-class residential buildings). Every morning continental breakfast was served as has been described here. The cappucinos were excellent but otherwise the meal was nothing to get excited about. I did like the baskets placed on the dining tables that contained melba toast, cookies, muffin, crackers, etc. The location of the hotel is another mixed bag. Yes, it is completely convenient to Termini Station where we availed ourselves to the metro and buses, and got around the entire city without a problem. The Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore is indeed just a couple of blocks away but everything else is a trek altho doable. We walked for miles so if you don't mind hiking, you can walk to everything - including the Vatican - altho I don't recommend it. The main problem with the hotel is the neighborhood it sits in. We're ex-New Yorkers so we're used to grimy urban areas, but nonetheless, we felt slightly turned-off by the immediate neighborhood (in NY terms, it was like staying next to the Port Authority Bus Terminal). The neighborhood was dirtier than other Roman neighborhood. At night, it was dark and creepy with very low-class and scary individuals stumbling around outside (we're convinced we saw a drug deal going on down the street). We walked around and found a very mixed immigrant population (indians, africans, chinese, arab) living in the neighborhood, which there is nothing wrong with but not what we expected for our vacation spot. I would not recommend this hotel for people who are not used to this type of environment.

I had been travelling for about 6 hours to get there and when I got there the rude man at the desk asked for my passport immediately, asked me to fill out paperwork and wouldn't let me into my room before I paid for it. Uncalled for. He wouldn't even let me drop off my bags first and let me splash my face even though I told him I was exhausted. Then he proceeded to tell me that breakfast ended exactly at 10:00 and that I had to check out by 11:00 on the dot. Good day to you too! Yikes. I felt like a criminal not a guest. To top it all off, after spending the day and evening with a friend of mine, I invited him up to my room after dinner and sightseeing so he could pick something up and so we could hang out some more and say goodbye before I left the next morning and the same cranky man would not let him in the room with me! Can you believe that? How can they determine whether a person has a guest or not? I've never experienced anything like that before and since I'd paid for the room I don't see how that was right but there you go. Do NOT stay at this hotel.

After you leave the bus, you can either walk into the Termini station and walk straight thru to Giolitti, or you can walk around the station and end up on Giolitti as well. Once there, head one more block away from the station. You will either end up on Turati itself, or it will say Amandola. If Amandola, turn left and keep walking - Amandola turns into Turati. Our room was clean, the tiled floor nice and cool on our aching feet. It was a bit narrow and confined. There was an extra blanket in the wardrobe, as well as two extra pillows. The double bed was in actuality two twin mattresses pushed together. The view was an alley. The bathroom was fairly clean (a used cigarette butt was left in the window sill upon our arrival), but I could not call it spacious. The shower stall was tiny... my husband had to squeeze into it sideways as the opening was only about a foot wide. I had trouble washing my long hair as there was not enough room to bend over to wash the underside. The toilet also was situated at a weird angle to the shower stall, which made sitting a rather gymnastic fete. They have two waiting rooms and a library with some guidebooks in various languages, as well as novels. We enjoyed the waiting room while we waited to check in and after we had checked out. (They allow you to use the rooms if waiting for a later flight.) They offer luggage storage, which we did not ask about - but also the Termini station has a left luggage facility for you to check in your luggage for a fee of around 4 Euro for five hours. The line does get rather long, and so we opted to keep our bags with us and hung out in the station on our last day as we waited to leave for our flight. Breakfast times change (I've seen it written for different times and none of them matched), but they should let you know at check-in. It is a simple repast. Depending on how you do with the typical Italian breakfast (coffee and a croissant) you could always hit a restaurant on your way out. Oh, when you leave the room, you leave the key with the front desk. When you come back, you get the key back. You can easily walk to the Colosseum from the hotel. Turn left and left again and keep walking until you come to the Maggiore Plaza. From there, look for Cavour and then walk down that road until you come to the end of it (there will be signs for the Roman Forum, which is pretty much in front of you by then). Look left, and you will see the outcropping of the Colosseum. For most anything else, I would suggest the Metro. And a GOOD map. We also kept our eye out for tour groups (a lot of them were headed for things of \"importance\"). --We never did find the Trevi Fountain! (It's behind a hotel off the main road.) Signs for the attractions are sparse and at times confusing. Also, be diligent about those pickpockets and beggars. There are good websites out there that give tips on what to look out for (some of the scams, etc) as well as how to protect your valuables. I had my pockets rifled thru extremely quickly on a particularly crowded subway ride, but thankfully I kept nothing in my pockets.", "Date": "September 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North East England, UK", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel\u201d", "Author": "kez8905", "ReviewID": "UR3824468", "Content": "this was a clean hotel very near to the main train station which was convenient because Rome is so large you have to walk quite far in order to see the sites so getting on a metro is easier!

After weeks of reading reviews on hotels, we settled on the Kennedy Hotel, mainly due to the location (convenient for the station) the price and the facilities the hotel offered. We were not disappointed ! We booked the hotel through Venere, which proved very quick & easy, and flew in to Ciampino by Ryanair so we were able to purchase our transfer coach tickets ( Terravision coach ) on board the aircraft, it's 8 euro single or 13.50 return. If you have to buy your ticket when you land, the ticket booth is to your right as you enter the arrivals hall. The bus waits for the passengers, they run half hourly & the journey time is around 20 minutes to the Termini station, the bus stops on Vai Marsala, so you only have to walk through the station, cross the Via Giovanni Giolitti, go a block to either the via Amandola or if you're on the via Filippo Turati you'll see the hotel. It takes about 5 minutes to walk from the station. All the hotel staff were very friendly, there is still some renovation work going on, but it's not intrusive. The room we had was on the 5th floor, easily reached via the modern lift. Although compact in size, it had two windows, a small wardrobe ( closet) a desk, nightstands, luggage stand phone, Sat TV ( one BBC world channel & one CNN - other channels were Italian) a huge very comfortable bed & that wonderful invention, air conditioning ! The bathroom was very modern, with large shower, basin, loo & bidet. The bedlinen was crisp & changed daily, as were the large soft bath towels. Note that there are no room safes ( although the things we left in the rooms were not touched) nor is there a mini bar. The hotel has a bar area downstairs along with two lounge areas & a small library - we never used these during our stay. Breakfast ( served 7.15-9.45) is taken in a choice of three charming interconnecting rooms. The breakfast consists of 4 cereal varieties, hot croissants, bread rolls, various cakes, yoghurts, tinned fruit salad , jams, processed cheeses, jams & a variety of biscuits, crackers & german bread. The orange juice is OK & the tea variety is good but the cappucino is wonderful & freshly made for you. We walked to all the sights, not wanting to miss anything by using the metros, buses or trams. If you want to use the bus etc, first buy your tickets either in the station or at a ' Tabacchi '. Remember to validate your ticket when you enter the bus. The restaurants we most enjoyed were the 'Nouva Stella', on via Daniele Manin, & 'Baires' , an Argentinian restaurant on via Cavour, not far from the Colosseum. Buy a gelato from anywhere, the ice cream is wonderful ! There's a good supermarket, 'SMA' situated near the Sta M Maggiore, just walk down via Gioberti. It even sells pieces of cooked chicken if you fancy having a picnic ! The little parks we found were all locked though, probably due to the beggars/homeless of which there are many. We never had a problem with pickpockets nor did we see any danger. There is grafitti & litter as in any major city,........shame! We bought day return tickets to Florence from the self-service machines in the station( lots of helpful English speaking staff around ) on the Eurostar, journey time 1 hour 35mins, cost 58.88Euros for two, one way. It was well worth it, Florence is beautiful. We ate a great pizza in the 'Yellow Bar' & wandered around the markets selling fantastic leather goods. We had a great time & would stay there again, thank you to Venere & to the Hotel Staff for making it so pleasant to be in Rome !", "Date": "July 30, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "vienna", "Title": "\u201cVery nice, clean Hotel for a good price and good located\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3682797", "Content": "We stayed at the Hotel Kennedy Rome in July 2005.

My two cautions: IF you have allergies, you should be aware that the hotel only uses the air-conditioning during certain times of the year (they told me that they would not turn it in since it was only late March ( I didn't really press the issue however since my allergies surprisingly didn't flare up and it really wasn't that hot as it turned out). Secondly, I, personally, would not have felt comfortable walking down the street alone after dark since I am rather small woman (that wouldn't really be smart in any city however I suppose..). There were a couple questionable, and somewhat, aggressive people out in the alley beside the hotel around midnight. Since I was with my husband each night, I felt completely fine, so unless you are a small woman who wants to walk alone after dark, the neighbor seems safe enough. Also, the neighborhood at the opposite end of the termini is pretty sketchy so you should be sure that you are walking in the right direction when you exit the termini- I got confused about which door I exited and got somewhat turned around (don't go left out of the termini- Go straight or right unless you are positive you know which direction you are headed). You need to walk straight for a block when leaving the MAIN exit and then turn left on onto Fillipo Turati. You only got down about a block or so).

I have skimmed thru the reviews and I will agree with some. Termini is not a pretty or romantic location but it is safe. I have spent 3 months in this area on 8 trips and have never had a physical concern about my safety. The shower stalls are small but at 6'2\" 275lbs I managed to use them :). If you are on the Via C. Cattaneo side you can hear those 0200 trash trucks. I didn't hear any construction noise until after 0800 on all my visits. The rooms and elevator are all new and cleaned daily. They are average+ European size, nicely decorated for a hotel, pleasant not dreary with a large closest, desk/chair, night table, suitcase stand, ensuite w.c., tv, phone. The breakfast comments have me baffled? For a 3* and even some 4* Italian hotels I have stayed in their b'fast is above average. Granted no meat or eggs but a choice of 3 different fresh bakery cakes, hot croissants (my favorite), 2 choices of bread, 2-3 different cereals, a few different yogurts, the tables have a basket with different kinds of packaged cookies/crackers/bread and a wide variety of jams and spreads. For drinks, coffee (expresso, cappuccino, americano), tea, milk and ok that watered down OJ that they all serve:). An all-you-can-eat buffet in 3 nice interconnecting b'fast rooms. The reception is open 24hrs but they do run a quiet hotel, the vast majority are middle-aged (Germans, some Americans, French and younger Japanese). So I can see them having problems with late-nighters coming back from a Pub-Crawl :). The staff has always been very friendly and welcoming to me. This year ('05) because of the Dollar/Euro rate I was looking around for a cheaper hotel but I decided to bite-the-bullet because I like this hotel and it's staff. As I said in my 'Subject Line' try and find a better deal in this location for a 3* hotel that offers what the Kennedy does. In 8 trips I haven't. So for a 3* in this location I give it an Excellent (5) rating.

Although the hotel was obviously not a five star, it was very clean, friendly and convenient, an absolute bargain for the price! Our room overlooked the central courtyard and the view was indeed obscured by scaffolding as the external walls of the hotel were being renovated. However, notices apologising for the disruption were posted all over the hotel. (well, we all have to do our decoration and repairs at some point, don't we) We agree that the workmen started early, but you don't go to Rome to spend the whole day asleep in bed, do you! Although parts of the hotel looked as if they could do with a lick of paint, it was very clean and our room was cleaned every day.The tiled floors in the rooms are common place on the continent, and no doubt a blessing in the hot summer months!! Our towels were fine, fluffy, clean and changed daily. We can't comment on the size of the shower stalls as we had a bath with shower over, but I suspect the reference to 'the men's urinal' was actually the bidet!!! ( we were pleasantly surprised to find a four piece bathroom suite in a hotel of this price range!) The breakfast was great, continental in as much as it wasn't a full cooked English. Coffee, cappuccino, hot chocolate, tea etc, then unlimited juice, cereals, fruit, yogurt, cheese, croissants, breads,jams, cakes, biscuits!!! Much better than the usual cup of coffee and one croissant!! The staff were polite, helpful and spoke good English, and will arrange tours or taxis if you want them. Although the area around Termini is not the greatest, it isn't any worse than around the train station of any major city. There is graffiti all over Rome, not just around Termini. The Kennedy is in a very convenient location, two minutes walk away from the station, but we never once felt uneasy, even at night.We would not hesitate to recommend the Kennedy to anyone who wanted a reasonably priced hotel in a very convenient location and weren't expecting the RITZ for the price!!!
