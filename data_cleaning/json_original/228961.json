The entry and reception area is clean and bright and the staff professional and polite. The location is good for travel. It's a short walk across one bridge to the train station and a slightly longer walk to Piazza del Roma via another bridge where the coaches and car parks are to be found. For those who enjoy walking, such as ourselves, its an easy walk from the hotel to the main attractions of Venice, However, if time is of the essence or you are not one who favors exploring by foot there are other hotels closer to Piazza St Marco, although without the proximity to mainland transport. The breakfast which was included in our booking was taken in the Hotel's restaurante. The breakfast was better than most hotels offer although was no where near as extensive as those offered in Dubai or Thai hotels we have experienced. The room, while comfortable, was far smaller than we expected and the bathroom presented it's challenges - yes it was small and the shower was not easy for a tall western frame to manage, The rooms were also showing their age and the need for refurbishment showed. The rooms were nevertheless clean. The staff were extremely helpful with all our requests and nothign seemed too much trouble for them,. So full marks here. On the down side, as with most if not all hotels on the island(s) of Venice, the hotel is not value for money. But from discussions with others in Venice at the time and a healthy dose of internet trolling it lines up with its competition. If you really need to save the dollars, there are lower cost and comfortable hotels on the mainland a short buss ride from Venice, but of course you don't get the canal location and the convenience.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Holmfirth, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect\u201d", "Author": "JayneA3", "ReviewID": "UR127990716", "Content": "This hotel is perfectly situated just 5 minutes walk from the Piazzale de Roma where the coaches from Marco Polo Airport drop you off.

We wanted to visit Venice for some time and when I found this hotel we booked it. The hotel is situated opposite the railway station (separated by the grand canal) and a short walk from the bus station at Plaza le Roma. Easy to find and remember, if you choose a hotel not on the grand canal, you face a long walk as we witnessed many people doing (there's no other way to get to your hotel once dropped off by the bus/water bus or water taxi). On arrival at Marco Polo Airport, walk outside and you can take the bus directly to Venice at a cost of 5 Euro (9 Euro return). Alternatively, we booked a water taxi in advance which sped us directly to the small pier at the hotel, well worth the cost. The breakfast at the hotel is buffet style with bacon and scrabbled eggs, fruit salad (tinned but enjoyable), fresh fruit, bread, cheese, ham, yoghurts, selection of jam, coffee and breakfast tea. We always found something to eat and never had any problems, We chose a room overlooking the Grand Canal (well worth the extra cost). The room was beautiful and finished in a typical Venetian style. Although small, it's only to be expected as the building is very old, but it was all we needed, lived up to our expectations, was as described by the hotel and was always kept clean. Some people have reported the noise level as you're at the front of the hotel, but when you realise that everything (including people) is transported via the Grand Canal, it's only to be expected. The view from the room also enabled much people watching and we never had a noise issue. We did find our room to be too warm, but through open the windows and invited Venice to join us, MARVELOUS. Staff were on the whole very good although when busy, reception staff tended to focus on their work rather than waiting customers. On returning to the hotel after a day exploring, we often sat outside the Restaurant at a small table enjoying a coffee (which was only 3.50 Euro). The waiter at the bar who served us coffee was a credit to the hotel, always had time to sped with us and was always willing to please and provide exceptional service. The best way to explore Venice is on foot and this hotel is in a perfect location. Overall, would we go back to Venice . . DEFINITELY, would we use this hotel again . .

After looking at some of the brilliant reviews for this hotel we thought it would would be ideal for us and we were not wrong. From the airport, we bought a cheap return coach ticket direct to Venice bus station - the ride only took us 20 minutes (plus ten minutes waiting at the bus stop) The Italian scenery was nice on the way giving us a great introduction to the city. From the coach station, the hotel is literally 5 minutes walk away and very easy to find. We were greeted in a friendly fashion at the reception desk and given a map detailing Venice and its attractions which was very helpful. A porter then showed us to our room, which, although on the ground floor and not looking out onto the canal, for our needs it was perfect being quite spacious and clean. The bed was comfy also and we had no trouble getting to sleep. Our only critisism would be the noise early in the morning. Unsure whether this was the other guests making the racket or the staff! Either way, we would still come back to this hotel. Breakfast was 'ok', not a great amount of choice but we still didn't go hungry. The service was great, the waiter/waitresses made you a coffee or tea as soon as you sat at your table. If you want to have a drink at the hotel bar, be prepared to pay a lot (over 10 euros for two drinks)! A walk finding some local bars is a much cheaper option. In terms of Venice atmosphere in Winter, we arrived on the last day of the February festival. The streets were packed with people in masks and costumes. It was great to experience, though it was absolute madness. The time we spent in Venice, we were lucky to have really nice weather - the sun shone everyday and felt warm enough to take off our jackets. St Mark's Square is a good half an hour walk through the narrow streets and over bridges but is well worth it if you want to see all the sights Venice has to offer. We were so glad we didn't buy any Vaperetto tickets, as we would have missed out on so much. Definitely visit the Bell Tower, it's relatively inexpensive and has great views all over the city.

I would recommend getting a pass for 24/36/48 hours - we got a 48 hour pass for 28 EUR, otherwise its about 6 EUR per trip so it can get expensive. The service is frequent and quick too. Alternatively, you can walk through the streets and across the bridges to reach wherever you want. Although the hotel is at the end of the canal, its a perfect location in my opinion. You have the bus station 5 mins away, the train station to catch trains to Verona etc opposite and one of the biggest Vaporetto stops right opposite. It is also a lot cheaper to eat and drink in this district. Average prices for 2 pizzas, 2 soft drinks, a side salad and cover (bread and breadstiscks) is about 30-35 EURO, nothing is cheap in Venice, the soft drinks in all of the restaurants are a min of 3.50 EURO and water is about 4-5 EURO!! The restaurant on the corner as you walk over the bridge is quite pricey, 50 EURO for lunch - omelette, pasta and 1 bowl of chips and 2 diet cokes!!! We got a vaporetto to san marco and went up the bell tower, 8 EUR each and you can go straight up and get some amazing views - it was especially lovely as we had fab weather - sunny all the time and blue skies. We then sat at a cafe in st marks square where my boyfriend proposed....:-) Beware of the prices... 8.50 EUR (\u00c2\u00a37.30) for a can of coke!!! Walking from st marks square through the narrow streets is lovely and you can get to Rialto in about 10-15 mins, the shopping streets are lovely but the designer shops are very expensive, more so than in the UK. Rialto is lovely too and there are some lovely restaurants and cafes lining the canal. Florida restaurant was nice and the cafe on the opposite side was a nice place to sit in the day and watch the world go by. Beware of the gondola's... on the first day we were offered a gondala from one of the side canals for 60 EUR to go down the whole canal and the side canals.... we didnt go then on the last day we enquired about the gondolas from outside of the hotel to go to Rialto.... (not far) and they said 110 EURO!! Barter and try to get one from the side canals and also try to go on one in the day as they are a lot cheaper. We caught a Vaporetto to Murano and saw the glass factory which was interesting and then caught the vaporetto over to Burano which was beautiful, the streets are lined with colourful houses, beautiful shops selling hand made lace and souvenirs and lovely restaurants on the canal. Overall a lovely trip, Venice is lovely and a beautiful place to explore... it is very expensive and nowhere is cheap but I would definitely go back to this hotel and definitely go back to Venice to explore more as there is so much to see and do......", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul, Turkey", "Title": "\u201cgreat value for Venice\u201d", "Author": "AzerB", "ReviewID": "UR125470558", "Content": "Stayed there during the peak of the bienalle & the rate I got for 3 nights was what the other hotels were offering for 1.

If coming in via train, the station is right accross the canal, there is one bridge to cross over. I do agree with a previous comment : taking a taxi (with wheels) is not a good idea, actually to any location in the city. Walking with suitcases is not fun. If I had taken a water taxi, I would have arrived at the front door of the hotel. The sitting area on the front is fun, good drinks & great for people watching. I wanted the room with the terrace, which was not availble so got another on the ground floor, on the courtyard. This is so much better as you get extra space & air. As the room did not look out to any street or canal, it does get the city noise, so turned out to be for the best. Although the hotel personel is a bit noisy in the morning when watering the plants & talking to each other. I have my eyes set on another hotel that I discovered, if I can't stay there next time, will come back here. The breakfast was ok, nothing to complain or praise.

It really didn't matter though in the end. Was absolutely sure i knew exactly how to get to the hotel and that it was very straight forward but arriving at night it all looks very different. So we had a bit of trouble finding the hotel. so many bridges and wondering if we were crossing the right one. Eventually got there and as you walk in it really is lovely.Was very pleased with our room despite having 3 windows but no canal views, which i was initially disappointed about,decided not to ask to change it.Unfortunately we had a terrible first night being regularly woken by what we think must have been shutters banging against the opposite building walls.So first thing in the morning we asked if possible could we change rooms which was no problem at all and we were more than happy with the much quieter room we were given.Still no views of the canal but we decided that it didn't really matter because as soon as you step outside the hotel they are all around you. Everywhere you look is a photo opportunity. We knew having such a short time we would want to cram a lot in and so got a 72hr vaporetto pass which was well used but we also did a lot of walking too. We found it very easy to get around Venice and never really got completely lost as we had expected to. Everywhere seemed well signposted.I had been once before only for a couple of hours back in 1968 and had always wanted to return one day so it was a very special return to be with my husband for our 40th anniversary and his first time too. We pre-booked a Secret Itineries tour for inside the Doges palace with a very good English speaking guide which we thoroughly enjoyed. Had time to wander around the palace too on our own, went into the basilica in St.Marks square, art gallery at Accademia, the Rialto, Canareggio, off and on the vaporettos,didn't seem to stop but only really touched the surface and would definitely return to explore a lot more. Despite the freezing cold weather we still think it would be better to come either a bit early or late in the year as we were suprised at how many tourists there were in early Feb so can only imagine how heaving it must get in high summer. Breakfast at the hotel was very good with more than enough choice for us.Rolls,croissants, toast.jams, fruit, juices,egg, bacon.cold meats etc. Really nice coffee and jug of hot milk, choice of teas.Very nice waiting staff and manager.

The room was very comfortable with all facilities and, thank goodness, had quiet and easily adjustable air conditioning. The furnishings were traditional and pleasing. The large bed was firm, which suited us. To sleep one must shut the exterior blinds. This is done by opening both windows. The handle has to be in the horizontal mode to first open the right hand window inwards Then the left is opened by raising upwards the thin metal lever inside the recessed frame itself near the base. ( I make this comment as other reviewers have had difficulty cloing blinds). The room lacked tea and coffee making facilities which was a shame. This is a traditionally built hotel so do not expect large sunlit Standard rooms. The room was well serviced daily. The main rooms of the hotel are very pleasing, light, and very tastefully furnished. One can eat in the restaurant where the food is very good indeed. We took the half board option and had our dinner outside. This great as we watched canal traffic etc Breakfast provided a full range of continental cold and hot dishes. For those who wish to dine elsewhere,there is a good choice of Restaurants along the nearby Novo canal. We found the staff to be excellent. Receptionists were cheerful helpful and did their best to answer my stupid questions! The waiters were first class! Special mention must go to Fillipo, Enrique, and Andrea who made our dining experience so memorable. (my partner's 60th birthday!) The hotel is only 3 to 5 minutes from the Piazale Roma bus station, and also the Waterbus and Railway Stations opposite. For those who like to walk and explore (and Venice is so much worth it), Reception will provide a very useful map which shows all the main places of interest. Venice is quite compact and visual surprises and delights await you around every corner. It takes about 40 minutes to walk to Piazza San Marco. For non walkers, It is worth buying a ACTV Waterbus pass (32 Euros for 72 hours unlimited travel). With the pass you can visit and explore the islands of Guidecca, (great views of Venice'interesting churches,and cheaper bars etc) and Murano. Any \"free\" boat to Murano should be treated with care. One can end up at a glassworks of an associate of the driver and be given a really hard sell with no promise of a boat back! The No2 Bus is faster to San Marco than the No1 which stops everywhere.

But first, let me point out the good things about this hotel: 1- Location of the hotel is wonderful. It is on the grand canal, and right across from the train station. You only have to cross one bridge and you're there, barely a 5 min walk. Also, this hotel is near a major street, on which you will find many restaurants, grocery stores, shops (gift shops, brands, big chain retailers, etc). This street is very packed with tourists and locals, and if you walk through this street for about 15 to 25 min (depending on how fast you walk), you will find yourself at San Mark's square, where all the action is. However, even if you decide to stick to the area near the hotel, that area is also very well alive. 2- The rooms at the hotel are very clean and its decorated in a classic Venetian style. Housekeeping staff are really friendly, and will always smile at you and welcome you. 3- Receptionists were really friendly and helpful. They will gleefully answer any question you have and will guide you to any place you want to go, and they will also inform you of all the options available to you in terms of how to get there. They will make it easy for you, especially if this is your first time to Venice and you know nothing about it. Now on to the bad stuff at this hotel: 1- In our second day at the hotel, we returned to the room and found it all cleaned up and shiny, but the housekeeper had removed the soap bar from the bathroom, and did not provide new one. We called housekeeping and asked for a soap bar. No one showed up at the door. Later on, we discovered a storage room for housekeeping on our floor which had soap bars, fresh towels, etc. The room was unlocked, so we took what we needed. 2- No wi fi service in rooms. If you want to access the internet, you have to go to the bar and get a password from the bartender. Very inconvenient, and connection speed was horrible.

The routes shown from here on their web site map are correct, but the shortest & easiest is to head toward the glass bridge across the road, but not go over it.

Staff are welcoming, friendly and most helpful, speaking excellent English into the bargain, as most locals do. Enrico was most attentive at meal times, as well as at the outdoor tables where we spent most late evenings soaking up the atmosphere. Our room was at the back on the 1st floor, so no noise at all. Having said that, it didn't appear to get noisy at night anyway. Bedrooms & corridors are decorated in 18th century style, so not to be confused with being \"old fashioned\" or in need of updating. Lobby and lounge are more modern. Someone commented about their room being dark, even during the day. I can only guess that it was due to the window shutter not being opened.

Firstly I must say that the trip to Venice was fulfilling a dream of my Mother who is in recovery after suffering a serious illness in 2010. The Hotel were aware of this and although we had already booked Superior Rooms, gave us beautiful rooms with a view of the Grand Canal. This made the trip so much more special for my Mum, and I can't thank the Hotel enough for this. LOCATION: The Hotel is a five-ten minute walk from the nearest parking area Garage San Marco- a cost of 30 Euro's per night, but the hotel provides a 10% discount on this at the end of your stay). We stayed during Italy's recent Heatwave, so even this short walk over 2 bridges with suitcases was tough going! However, in usual temperatures this would be okay for most. If you arent in the best of health then you can use Water Porter's for a cost of around 30 Euros to transport your bags. HOTEL: The Hotel is in a lovely setting- right on the side of the Canal, with comfortable chairs and tables positioned outside so that you can watch the world go by! Inside, the entrance is impressive and opulent, with marble and comfortable sofas and chairs and flower displays filled with Orchids. The rooms we stayed in had Cancal Views and fabric on the walls with extravagent headboards on the bed, murano glass light fittings and elegant mirrors! Beautiful and VERY Venetian. The Bathrooms were large and spotlessly clean. We had just a shower in ours but it was large and the pressure was good. My Mother had a bath and a shower- although she did warn that she was glad she wasnt overweight as I understand the bath was little on the snug side! Be warned if you are a larger bear! Both rooms had air conditioning that worked well, and large windows that you could open to expose wonderful vista's! FACILITIES We mainly visited the Hotel Bar. The drinks are as reasonable as Hotel Prices can be and are accompanied by Canapes, Salted Peanuts and Crisps...if you order tea or coffee you get Biscuits! It is all spotlessly clean and you feel very indulgent! If you visit, I hope that you are lucky enough to be served by Dario- professional, friendly,welcoming and so hardworking....it was such a pleasure to meet him and we much preferred him to the slightly grumpy Maitre D's! . FOOD- My only criticism of this hotel is that on our first morning we went to Breakfast Buffet Style) and I found what appeared to be 'Fruit Flies' crawling all over the bread.....LOTS of them. The Lids on the scrambled egg and Bacon canteens had also been left open and again, more flies were gathering. This turned my stomach and as a result I didn't eat a meal in the hotel again...but this was my only criticism and can be easily remedied. PS: Room Service is pretty scace- think it was offered between 12 and 2 and then again between 7 and 10 approx...but then why are you sitting in your room when in Venice?!! :) OVERALL- A lovely Hotel..if ever we returned to Venice, we would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cIf over 180 cm tall, best to stay elsewhere.\u201d", "Author": "David A", "ReviewID": "UR117333902", "Content": "We chose to stay at the.

The A/C was temperamental and the room did get warm. At some point they did renovate rooms in this hotel but now they desperately need updated bedspreads/bedding and baths. Rooms are small, but that is not unexpected in Venice. We chose the hotel because of its proximity to the train station, just over the bridge. Also the very close-by bus hub was a big convenience since our daughter was flying in to meet us in Venice and the bus is a good way to easily get into the city from the airport.

Even before we left, the contact at the hotel, Jessica, gave us so much information on how to get to the hotel. *Warning*: at the airport, the man at the taxi desk tried to rip us off. He kept insisting that the ONLY way to get to the hotel was via one of his water taxis (100 euros!) or a private taxi (170 euros!!). I knew this was incorrect because Jessica had told us about these options as well as private car, private taxi, taxi, and bus. (He was trying to make it seem as though you can only get there through water ways and failed to mention the bridge that connects the island to the mainland so that cars can cross.) This made me so upset that he was trying to take advantage of us since he was at the official desk at the airport, not out on his own. That was very deceiving and had I not had all the advice from the lovely hotel, I never would have known. We ended up walking outside to try to find a taxi ourselves and ended up taking the ATVO bus, which I had been hesitant to take at first, for only 5 euros a piece! It was fast and drops you at the same place a private car would have (in the Piazzale Roma). The only way to get dropped directly in front of the hotel is by water taxi, but there are so many other options--don't feel you can't have options! From there it is a 5-10 minute walk along the canal (over a couple of bridges) to the hotel. It wasn't really fun to walk over the bridges with our luggage, but doable so we could save 100+ euros in travel. (Hint: once you get pointed in the right direction to get the hotel--just walk toward the canal--don't take the huge bridge. Go down the steps on the right and walk along the right side of the canal and the hotel will be on that side after crossing 2 white stone bridges. It's a little shorter.) Another plus about this hotel is the amazing breakfast we had included. We got there so early on the day of our arrival that we were able to enjoy it once we got there and it was so filling: cereal, eggs, sausage, fruit, pastries, toast, bagels, cream cheese...mmmm. The rooms are small, but expected since European luxury hotels are different from those in America. There was a small fridge, but they have things for purchase in it so you can only fit in a can or two of your own soda. We had a room that had a balcony that overlooks the canal which I highly recommend. We had a lovely breeze, could sit out and people watch, and got some great pictures of it all lit up at night. In the bathroom, there was even an outlet that was compatible with US cords. I hadn't purchased a converter since we were going on a cruise line, but it was handy so we could plug in a curling iron or charge our laptop (it is placed within the wall though, so you'd need a cord and not a charger that lies flush with the wall like some camera chargers). Also, the location is near a lot of great shopping. Just cross the bridge over to the side of the train station (the side opposite the hotel) and walk and walk to find gelato, food, shops, farmer's markets, churches, you name it. You can get a gondola ride too. The next day, to get to the port, we walked back (again, it's easier to walk along the canal on the side the hotel is on, not the train station as the bridges are a little shorter) to the Piazzale Roma and took the People Mover for only 1 euro a piece.

Her English was perfect and her manners and friendly nature just added to the experience before we'd even got their! She also encouraged us to get in touch nearer the time to be given a list of trips, exhibitions etc that were on to get the most out of our stay. The man at reception was extremely friendly - we arrived rather early so they put our luggage in secure storage and were welcome to stay in their rather beautiful waiting area, but decided to go for a wander to kill time. We had asked for the \"cheapest\" (if a room in an amazing 4* hotel can be cheap!) room which would overlook a courtyard, but to our surprise, someone had actually upgraded us, which we werent told to begin with. The porter who accompanied us to our room with our luggage took great pleasure in being the one to tell us we'd be pleasantly surprised, and seemed about as thrilled as we were when we opened the shutters on the window to find we'd been upgraded to a room with a view of the Grand Canal! Amazing. The room, needless to say, was absolutely stunning. It wasn't huge but it didn't need to be at all, and technically we shouldn't have even been in that room! Beautiful big bathroom with a great shower and all other amenities you could possibly want. The cleaner did an absolutely amazing job with our room - it was immaculate. This was our first experience in a 4* hotel so having porters etc do things for you was strange...in a good way, and they were politely insistent that they took our luggage - the only thing that upset me was the way the cleaner would apologise when she knocked to clean the room to find out we hadn't gone out yet, and when she walked across the corridor in front of us and again, apologised. It was absolutely not a problem in the slightest - she was lovely and did a very good job, though we wouldn't have minded if she'd left the room as it was! It just makes me wonder how other guests who do expect the 5* treatment all the time treated the \"help\" staff there. We tipped very well at the end of our two nights stay because she had worked so hard. I don't care if it's expected of them, they deserve some credit. The breakfast buffet...well, I've never seen anything like it! It was beautiful. It just had your standard buffet food, but I think it's partly to do with the room it was all laid out in. It was just fantastic. The food quality was beautiful too and the waiting staff again were lovely and very attentive. We didn't use their evening restaurant service because we ate out each night, but the menu sounded lovely. And it was a great addition having an accordion player outside our room one evening! The hotel also offers a great private gondola tour deal with the gondoliers just outside the building. We had initially thought it was 100 Euros per person, but we had expected the cost to be high so went for it anyway. It was, in fact, 100 Euros for the tour, so for the two of us it was just 50 Euros. The boats could seat between 5 or 6 people though, so in the event of a family tour, the price is great. Our gondolier was lovely, and it was nice to have the boat to ourselves. We went up the Grand Canal and he gave us a guided tour, then he took us round the back streets as it were between all the ols houses and their hotels. The whole thing lasted 35 minutes and we were serenaded too. The hight of romance if that's your thing! It really was the highlight of our Venice trip. In all, 5/5 for this hotel for food, service, room, sleep quality etc. What I loved about this place was the quality of work and effort from everybody - from the manager to the cleaners. A hotel can't function without a decent, strong body of staff who are all important, no matter how \"low\" their position would appear when ranked.

The walk back was incredible, but it does take about 45-60 minutes depending on how much you stop and look at all the shops along the way! Doge's Palace is absolutely incredible and a must see as well as the glass factory. Took a cruise to Barano Island and that was so peaceful and a welcome repreive from the crowds of Venice. Get up early and sit at the tables in front of the hotel to watch all of the supply boats come in. It is incredible to see these little boats coming down the canal with cases of water and dog food!

We booked the hotel for two nights, but checked out after the first night. There was a problem with our booking arrangements when we arrived for check in, and the clerk on duty (no manager available) was not very helpful. They were able to find another room in the hotel for us, an upgrade ofcourse, but at nearly triple the price of the room we booked prior to arrival!! Unfortunately it was late and we had no other hotel arrangements elsewhere, so we were forced to pay the ridiculous price to stay at the Carlton. We were told to see the manager the next morning to discuss and resolve the problem, but again there was no manager on duty or available for us to speak to. The morning clerk wasn't able to assist us with the problems or our stay, so we packed our bags and checked out. Upon checking out and paying for our one night stay, we reviewed the bill and we were charged even more for the room than we were quoted the night before, so the bill had to be readjusted. There was no consistency with the quoted room rates. Regardless of the problems we were having, we were more than willing to try to work with the hotel and felt that we were being completely reasonable asking them to bill us for the price we were originally quoted when we booked the room, but the hotel would not work with us. Customer service does not seem to be a concern for this hotel. As for the overall feel of the hotel, it was clean and had a welcoming atmosphere. The decor was beautiful and the rooms were nicely appointed. However, the bed was not very comfortable and the robes were not soft at all, they were hard to the touch.

At check in we were given a town map and given some advice about your location and some of the best ways to get around, a very handy start. The room itself would not be what i expect from a 4 star hotel, i would classify it more as a 3 star. there was nothing special about the room it was very small and come with a spare single bed - incase of arguments i guess! the bed itself was fine but it was not one of those beds you lay on and you instantly fill comfortable, what you want after a day on your feet. Simple things like the plug in the bath did not fit the plug whole, just a lack of attention to detail. Housekeeping always did a good job though. My top travel trip for a visit to venice would be to fly to verona and stay there as it is a very beautiful city and visit venice as a day trip. we did the opposite and see this as a real mistake. Return train tickets for 2 on the regional train which took about one and a half hours were only 22 euros. The best deal you can get in venice.

The other fact is unless you are on a cruise or trip you can't get your breakfast at that time ( the usual feeding frenzy is from 7.30) Don't get me wrong I don't mind whatever nationality stays in a hotel but when you get loads of them together the worst national traits appear ( just ask the Spanish in Andalucia about us Brits) Americans were not at the front of the queue when God handed out courtesy and the psuedo American wannabees the Japanese travel in shoals and all tend to bully those without 15 mates and hog facilities with ridiculous demands on the Reception, so we had to wait half an hour to check out whilst they complained about Oregano ( or Or-egg-gan-o) in the soup!!

The hotel clerks were not very friendly and when we asked if we could check-out 2 hours later than normal we were told we could check out 1 and a half hours later but not 2 hours later. What is the difference? The rooms were empty on that day, I walked around the halls just before we left and the rooms were empty (it was a Sunday). The hotel is so far away from the main areas like San Marco, it took so much time to get there. The reviews said just 26 minutes by vaporetto or 30 by walking, but it took much more than that. The Vaporetto had waiting times of course, and lines to buy the tickets. And the last direct No. 2 vaporetto on Saturday night stopped running at 8 something p.m. Also, walking might only take 30 minutes if you know the way but as tourists one never does. There is not really that much to see in the area of the hotel either. So I would suggest not staying there but at someplace closer to the main tourist sites. Unless of course you do not like tourist sites and are going for some other reason. The worst thing about this hotel, is that they do not have wireless internet! And no computer to use in the lobby or any business center! They only have a wire in the room which you have to plug into your computer if you've lugged one all the way to Venice. And it cost money which is not a problem but if you only have your iphone it does not have a place to plug into.

So after a 2 or so hour flight it was great to be in the city and at the hotel in such a short space of time. With regards to getting about and exploring the city we never had to walk too far to see the main sights (which you can get to easily if you follow the yellow signs on the buildings which are dotted everywhere). Walking from the Hotel = Rialto in 15-20 mins.... Piazza St Marco in 25-30 mins! THE HOTEL: I stayed here with my boyfriend from the 03/09/10-06/09/10 (3 nights). We stayed in a deluxe double which was a really good size, nicely decorated and very clean. We had a shower in our room which had a powerful shower and had hot water everyday! It was also very quiet which was nice after a busy and tiring day walking all around Venice! As for the view from our room... we didnt havent one... but then again we only came back to the room to sleep so it didnt matter. Although it would have been lovely to have a canal view! The Buffet breakfast was really good compared to what i've experienced in other Hotels..the coffee was particularly nice and there was a good selection of options... scrambled eggs, bacon, cold meat, cheeses, pastries, fruit and cereals! TIPS: Cafe Florian - it is definetely a must do as it is a beatifully decorated cafe....it is however very expensive! We both bought a cappucino and sat inside which cost us 8.50 euros EACH.... BUT we also got charged 6.50 EACH for the small musical ensemble that was playing outside (which was facing away from us haha!).. so 2x cappucino's actually cost us more like \u00c2\u00a330 haha... ohwell!! The (Jewish) Ghetto - Definetely the place to go for a good quality authentic meal that isn't over priced. Unfortunately we only explored this area on our last night! If you find the Fondamenta de la Misericordian which is a street in the Ghetto you will find lots of cosy little restaurants. There is also a traditional bar/restaurant where all the locals appear to go (I cant remember the name of it though!). This is the main problem we found...where the hell do you eat..you are spoilt for choice! Word of Caution: If they put bread on your table they will charge you for it (4-5 Euro's)...thats the one thing we quickly learnt...the Venetians love hidden charges haha! The Gondola - we paid 100 Euro's for a trip which took us up to the Rialto Bridge and back.... definetely the best way to see Venice...albeit expensive (we think it probably lasted 20-30 mins).", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beccles", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel in an excellent location\u201d", "Author": "babadavid", "ReviewID": "UR78727319", "Content": "We were a little worried that we were staying too far from St Marks Square but on arrival the hotel was stunning and the staff very friendly.

The hotel is really nicely and traditionally decorated throughout. It is about a 3 minute walk from the bus station, and easy to get to if you know what direction to go in.. When you get off the bus (don't go over the large glass bridge) go down the few steps in front of you, towards the canal, on the left there will be a small green bridge, go over that, then you come to a small stone bridge, go over that and the hotel is on the right down that road. We booked a deluxe double room with a view of the grand canal. I emailed a week before and requested if we could have one of the rooms with a small balcony, not just a window looking out, and we did get one with a balcony. The staff were really friendly and helpful in the emails and in person, and spoke fluent english. The room was a good size, you really don't need anything huge! The bed was big (and so comfortable, I slept so well both nights, there was no noise at all) & the shower worked very well. We put a do not disturb sign on in the morning so later that evening reception phoned up and asked if we wanted the maid to clean the room then, which was nice! I was also abit confused about what plug to take as I'd heard some places in Italy use plugs with 3 pins in a row, but the usual european ones with 2 were fine! The breakfast had something for everyone! Lovely croissants, with jams, choc spread, philadelphia, toast/bread, rolls, yoghurts, cereals, cold meats & cheese, fruit, bacon, scrambled egg, fruit juices, tea, coffee, hot choc. It was all really nice. It was served 7.30-10.30 (i think). There was so many restaurants and shops close by, and gondolas, water taxis and water buses right outside (with stops all the way down the canal) if you wanted to go further without walking. We walked most of the time, because you saw a lot more down the streets. You can't go wrong walking to St Marks Square... When you come out the hotel, if you cross over the bridge on the right then walk down the roads that way (about 25mins), it is lined with shops & restaurants and literally everyone is walking in the same direction to the square & rialto bride. There is also yellow signs pointing you in the right direction all the way, and if you go off track you'll always see a sign every now & then or just go towards the crowds. We actually preferred going off track, you could never get lost it was so small & so easy to get back to the busy areas if you wanted to, and we always felt so safe even though alot of the streets are narrow like alleys. We we much happier to be a little way from the square and main tourist areas because we got to see so much more of venice (it was our first time there). One day when walking towards St Marks, we didn't cross over the bridge outside the hotel, we stayed on the same side until a lot further down and walked through all quieter streets, over small bridges & often came across pretty courtyards with cafes which was really nice. This way had fewer tourist signs but as I said you can always find your way back to the main areas if you want to (theres often signs for vaporetto-water bus) so if you head towards that (if you get abit lost) that will take you back to the main canal & you can get on that for a few euros & go down to any point of the canal inc san marco (st marks sq,) There was a 'Hard Rock Cafe' just off the square which was really fun & stayed open til 00.30.. Really nice cocktails.. A lot of the other bars seemed very quiet, and quite small, so it was nice to go somewhere a bit more upbeat. We also had 2 really nice meals at restaurants (next to eachother) along the canal where the vaporetto drops you off. They both had cream tops. One was called 'Do Leoni' and was the restaurant in front of the 'Londra Palace Hotels' and the other was on the right of that also in front of a hotel and said 'RISORANTE', sorry can't remember the actual name! We had really nice steaks there. Overall we had such a nice time, & would definitely recommend the hotel. Its not right in the centre, but it really isn't far & like I said we much preferred it because you got to see alot more, and the walks & even the water bus rides were so nice. (the water bus runs 24hrs). I was deciding between the carlton, the rialto hotel, & the bonvecchiati (because I wanted a hotel on the canal, and these all looked the nicest from their websites, and were in my price range). I am so glad I picked the Carlton, it definitely looked the nicest from the outside, in person, and for all the reasons already mentioned. It had the best reviews too and now I can understand why.

We arrived late evening to a very warm and efficient welcome at reception with a porter standing by to take us to the room. We headed to the bar for a nightcap and again received a very warm welcome from the lovely staff. There are half a dozen or so tables outside the front of the hotel overlooking the Grand Canal which were perfect for people watching and viewing the canal activity. Breakfast was included in our deal and offered a fair selection, bacon, scambled eggs, various fresh fruit, ham, cheese, pastries, toast and preserves. Tea or various kinds of coffee were served at the table and again the staff were very friendly and efficient. Another bonus here is that breakfast is served up until 10.30am. We found the location very good. We had pre booked a private water taxi from the airport which dropped us off at the hotel landing stage. Just across the canal is the train station but as has been mentioned before, you have to cross a large bridge and l most certainly would not have cared for that trek with luggage. Just a short stroll from the hotel are many little cafes and restaurants.

STAY IF: you are short of money and they have a promotion like 60 euro per night (doesn't worth more) ; hotel owners are your relatives (family policy) ; will sleep and have breakfast in another place (use the hotel just to leave the baggage). Actually, don't stay even in these cases. Some days after the stay they offered a discount and an upgrade for returning guests who rate the hotel (with good ratings) in the Tripadvisor. Probably this is the reason they seem to be a nice hotel here. I paid 4 nights and left the hotel 1 night before because I could not stand the idea of sleeping one more night there. The worse is the noise in the room, at night and morning. Everything is noisy, specially in the neighbor rooms: flush, shower, bell, people walking and talking and also the corridor floor and the maid ringing the bells early in the morning. Add a hard bed and pillow, we have a restless trip. The front desk is hostile and blas\u00c3\u00a9, beside they are unhelpful. They didn't know the bus line to San Giuliano Park, for example. They did not indicate a good restaurant - just told there was not any good restaurant nearby. They did not seem to care if the stay would be pleasant. The room is small, but ok for a single room. But the bathroom is unbelievable. There is a 50cmx50cm bathtub where it is impossible to stay stand, and very uncomfortable to seat. Toilet seat cover doesn't stay open if you don't hold it. Soaps and shampoos are not replaced. Neither the towels. Breakfast is completely standard - some people may like it, if don't expect anything. They have the enough: few kinds of breads, fruits, eggs, bacon, cheese, ham, and NESCAFE. I don't like Nescafe, so I had the coffee outside. Actually, on the third day I ate at the train station. Service is, in some way, attentive, but there is nothing good to be served, so, worthless. I don't say it is in a good location because it is far from all Venice sights, though close to Train Station. After arriving by train there is a HUGE bridge between the station and the hotel, and you have to carry the bags through this bridge. My suggestion, if you have bags, is to stay at the same side of the station, like Rio Ter\u00c3\u00a0 Lista de Spagna. Or, take the vaporetto and go to the city center, near San Marco or Rialto. When I was leaving I would report my discontent, but for my surprise the attendant was sweet. I retained. Than she called the other attendant, unpleasant as all others and he made my check out. I tried to see her name to make an compliment. The badge says TRAINEE.

Even though it was night time,the sight was heavenly.Rooms are great,very beautifully appointed and very comfortable.For the three nights we stayed there, we slept very well with no disturbance at all.You wake up in the morning,open the balcony door and view the beautiful emrald green water of the canal, and all your spirits rise and you forget about the rest of the world and take in the splendour created jointly by Mother Nature and Mankind. The staff in the hotel were very polite,very warm and very helpful.Two persons who really went 'Above and Beyond' to make our stay enjoyable are Enrico and Dario.Realising that we were vegetarians, Enrico went out of his way to fix some nice veggie sandwiches for us.He speaks good English and we would recommend you find him out to answer any questions.You can't miss him, he is always there during breakfast. Very good and wholesome breakfast with a wide selection really makes this Hotel an exceptional choice for those visiting Venice.We would highly recomend the Carlton on the Grand Canal, for it's proximity to the Train Station, the Water Bus stop,the Gondola Station and all nice eating places etc. Most importantly, the very courteous and friendly staff make it more than 'worth it' to choose this place to stay.

The price included a great breakfast buffet which had many choices. We didn't eat at the hotel restaurant, opting instead for local cafes where the food was much cheaper and still excellent.

The hotel is directly across the canal from the Ferovia vaporetto stop which takes you anywhere in the city and to the islands as well. Buy a pass for the number of days that you are staying and its much cheaper than paying per journey. The hotel is just along from the Piazzale Roma which is where the taxis and buses from the airport drop you off but be aware that there are 2 bridges to cross between there and the hotel which are a bit of a slog with luggage - pack lightly. The hotel is in a good area and quiet by night but with access to restaurants and bars directly over the Scalzi Bridge which is about 50 meters from the front door. It is an easy walk to Rialto and on to St Marks Square if you are reasonably fit and active. The bridges can be tiring for the older traveller. If you are feeding a family or looking for authentic food at a good price go to Brek which is just down to road to the right as you come off the bridge. Not the best looking restaurant but full of Italians, basic but excellent food and the best prices we saw anywhere in the city. We had a thoroughly enjoyable vacation which was made all the better for staying in such a lovely hotel.Can highly recommend the Serenaded Gondola Ride which very schmaltzy but great fun (and the man can sing) and the Vivaldi Concert at Scuolo San Teodoro near to Rialto.

Not up to four star standard. Not much ambience in the restaurant for our candlelit dinner. Bread rolls were hard at dinner too. Very expensive (but then so was much of Venice). Gin and tonic E12. Very convenient for the railway station. The hotel faces you as you come out of the station. Be warned though, you can't see it from the bus station. We spent forty minutes trying to find it. Everyone we asked gave different directions. Most said don't cross the bridges, just follow the canal. What they meant was don't cross the big bridge. Instead, walk down the steps to the edge of the canal, go right under the big bridge and then go over the first small bridge you come to keeping the Grand Canal on your left. This bridge is green. Then go over the small stone bridge in front of you. The hotel is then 100 yards on your right. If you get lost ask for the railway station. In the summer this hotel would be a good choice as you're near the terminus for the vaparetto. In February it seemed too far away from the main sites.

Always had clean towels and bed made when we returned from a day out. Breakfast was pretty standard - I'm not snobby, just your average person and it was completely fine for me. Cereals, Continental, orange juice, etc etc. I was really happy with the location of the hotel: It's quite far from San Marco, but very close to the bus / taxi rank for getting back to the airport. Personally I enjoyed the fact we were away from the centre, as both days we found ourselves exploring the streets and alleys like a maze, eventually finding our way to the main tourist areas we wanted to visit, then we'd just get our way back to the hotel on the public transport along the Grand Canal. I think if we'd been situated right in the centre we'd have been overwhelmed by the number of tourists and we'd have had no real place to head for when we strolled about (as we'd already have been there!). We were told Lido was a good place for 'nightlife', but for us nightlife was non existant. We're from London, so we're used to a very vibrant clubby scene. We knew we wouldn't get that, but if you fancied a drink and a dance you'd be hard pushed to find a place.

A Water Taxi costs \u00e2\u201a\u00ac95!! very expensive i think especially when you have 1st arrived and dont forget you will be on a lot of boats in your stay anyway!! In a taxi you get dropped at the bus station. You simply need to walk over the huge bridge in front of you and walk along the canal for less than 10 mins. At this point the Hotel is on the other side of the canal (so on your right) you then cross another bridge and your at the hotel in seconds! NOTE: lots of baggae will make the crossing of the bridges tiresome, so if you have a lot of baggage maybe a Water taxi would be best for you as it takes you right to the hotel door!!! HOTEL; Entrance Foyer, bar and breakfast room LOVELY! looks newly done, fancy looking and modern. The room we stayed in 254 was a very good sized room! Large!! and this is a normal double i believe. But a little dated in the decor, to my personal taste, but VERY clean and bathroom a good size, white suite and again clean!! which is very important. The rooms are very different to the entrance and you do expect a fancy modern room, but dont be too put off, you are hardly in the room! The staff were absolutely lovely!!! They helped with the map and told you where to go, booked Restaurant's and taxi's for you, and were all so smiley!!! except one staff member at breakfast one day but apart from that Great! A guy called Andrea...and lady called Claudia...very helpful and so were the bar staff!! LOCATION: not directly in the actual centre, but when arriving this is perfect, otherwise you would prob not be able to find it!! Only about 15-20 mins walk into St Marks Square, but longer obv if your taking your time,LOTS of shops and lots of little lanes, the signs were great! its a great experience walking everywhere! We walked for hours and hours, and it was lovely! VERY hot though, the whole stay around 30degrees. was fab!! We didnt actually go into the Palace, or art galleries, but generally that is it for sight seeing, and churches. Have drinks by the Canal's are amazing!!! Had a lovely lunch by Rialto Bridge on the right hand side of it, the 1st in a row of restaurants...def go to the first!!! One thing you do need to know is that Venice is extremly expensive!!! \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 for 2 cokes in some places, but then \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 in others. Lunch (1 starter, 2 mains and 1 bottle of wine) \u00e2\u201a\u00ac95 but then anothr little restaurant by our hotel on the canal was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac95, for 2 startes, 2 bottles of wine and 2 mains! so that was def a better price!!! Of course went on a Gondola Ride... A must obviously! this is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 but i think i did see someone haggling and got it for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac70. The man was singing in Italian and giving us a History lesson which was great. There are lots of nice Restaurants, but i would definatley say eat on the canal at all times! there is no point in going to a restuarant in a little lane!!! The beauty of it all is the Canal's! You can get around on a water bus (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50) one way, or you can day passes, i would recomend walking though during the day as that is how you experience Venice, and you always turn down a new lane and discover another part of Venice!!

Some neato hotels do in Venice, where you get on a boat and go directly to the steps of the hotel, but i digress. This hotel is good transition for the USA folks, first time in Europe. Folks speak english, the rooms are clean, has working AC, usual hotel amenities, a little fridge. They are small and basically we used them for shower/sleep...u gotta see the town yknow. This was part of the Gate 1 Affordable Italy tour. Good start. Now, it is on the far west side of Venice. There are crowds around this hotel location, but it is quiet enough. Walk 500ft away, you get to the Bus station area with lots of people, and 500ft the other way to the ghettoaway, with alot of ppl too. The crazy tourist location is St Marks Square in the middle of venice which is about a 30min stroll. Really, You could walk all the way around venice in about 4 hours I would think. We were pleased with the hotel, I feel it's worth it for about $150-200 night. (my yard stick being a regular USA Hampton Inn being worth it at $100/night)", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen", "Title": "\u201cGreat All-round Hotel\u201d", "Author": "DODK", "ReviewID": "UR33636235", "Content": "As we were booking a trip to Venice for our last holiday together before the birth of our first child, I wanted to make sure we were getting a comfortable hotel in a convenient area as a good base for exploring the city for the first time. I tend to worry about everything, from transport to/from the hotel to the kind of area it is in, etc, etc, but I can say that this hotel ticked all the boxes and made for a great, relaxing trip. I'll try to summarise the main areas / points below: Location: Perfect for those who don't want to be slap-bang in the middle of busy, tourist-filled areas, this hotel is near the northern entrance to the Grand Canal, overlooking it. My worry was that it would be too near to the giant 'car park' at the end of the causeway linking Venice to the mainland. Also, that it was directly opposite the train station - I expected the are to be less than beautiful but was willing to compromise this for the convenience. I needn't have worried - when we arrived by bus from the airport (about 25mins), we stepped off the bus, over a bridge, round a corner and were at the hotel in about 4 minutes. I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel's entrance as it suggests a cut above the 'basic' accomodation I was expecting. With tastefully set tables outside for an evening drink (rather than the standard paper tablecloths often associated with pavement cafes) I was immediately reassured. The area is perfectly pleasant and attractive, with one of the Grand Canal's bridges a stone's throw from the hotel door. Being on the Grand Canal, you can catch a gondola or a water taxi from directly outside the hotel, or over the bridge you can catch a vaporetto. It is easy to cross the bridge and join the main tourist drag through to St Mark's (about a 35 min walk - at a leisurely pace!), or equally easy to avoid this, and turn the opposite way and immediately enter some of the quieter yet equally spectacular lanes and alleys you expect of Venice. On the way home we decided to treat ourselves to a water taxi and go out in style. I would heartily recommend this - ask at reception and they will order one. 2-3 minutes later they will carry your bags out to the boat (which moors directly outside the hotel) and whisk you off to the airport terminal. Definitely the best journey to an airport I've ever had. Rooms: As I understand it, all rooms in Venice are small by UK/European standards which is understandable due to space being at a premium. As this was our last 'big' holiday together, I opted for the 'Premium room with canal views'. Definitely worth it. Even our Premium Room was small - enough space for the bed, mini bar, dressing table, telly and cupboard and not much more. The en-suite was a shower only which was disappointing at first, but we got by fine without it. Our room, and toilet, had a window out onto the Grand Canal. There was a (very) small balcony which the 2 of us could stand out on to take in the view. In reality we only used the room for sleeping in at night, and for a break from the heat of the day around 3pm when we would come back and enjoy the air conditioning! The hotel seems to have quite a large capacity, and despite the large numbers of loud Americans we came across, we were never disturbed during our stay and it never felt uncomfortably busy. As for noise from the canal outside, yes you do hear the roar of boats' engines at about 7.30-8.00 in the morning, but we didn't find it too loud to be a disturbance. It made you aware that the canal was just outside your window and that Venice is very much reliant on it for all manner of things, but we found that part of the fascination rather than unpleasant. Cleanliness: Couldn't fault it at all for cleanliness. General appearance and rooms were spotless. Service: Again, great. All reception staff spoke English so our very limited Italian wasn't really required. Friendly welcome, with a free map and an explanation of routes to the main attractions. We were unlucky to have BA lose one of our cases on the way over, but when it arrived at the hotel the following day we found staff had taken it up to our room for us. Also, we checked out at noon on the day we left but didn't need to leave for the airport til 2pm, so the hotel kept our bags in a secure room until we returned. Breakfast was a great selection of cheese, meats, rolls, pastries, bacon & eggs, fruits, cereals, yoghurts (and even chocolate and pear cake one morning!). All self-service. Evening drinks outside the hotel are to be recommended - just make sure you are there as it gets dark, because there is a very funny man who comes out with candles and gives you a little song as he does so. I would also suggest eating at the hotel's restaurant. Venice isn't renowned for the quality of food, and we spent most of the week eating fairly basic (but tasty) food at the various Trattorias. On the last night we ate at the hotel and it was a cut above these. In fact, we found it difficult to find a better quality of restaurant on our travels around the city. Luckily the place is captivating enough, even for a couple of foodies like ourselves. Value: I would say that, even with the upgrade to a canal view room, this hotel represents very good value for money. It isn't the cheapest available, but you do tend to get what you pay for and this delivered on all counts, making for a relaxing, convenient and trouble-free trip to a lovely city.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location & Great Service\u201d", "Author": "WomblesofWimbledon", "ReviewID": "UR33345049", "Content": "You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get a better location than this hotel for Venice.

Our room was beautifully decorated with a double bed, and a bench/couch at the foot of the bed and a chair to the side with a TV. The room was snug, but we expected that. We didn't spend much time in the room either. It was quiet for sleeping and clean. (If you're looking for other hotels in Italy with larger rooms, please read my other reviews) The bathroom served it's purpose. The breakfast was included in our rate and was excellent. It was a mix of hot and cold food (eggs, ham, cold meats, canned fruit, and other breakfast breads). The best part about the hotel was the location.

From what I've learned, the Carlton is very popular with tour groups and travel agencies. The Carlton is located on the Grand Canal on the opposite side of San Marco's square. Due to the absence of cars we were dropped off at the train station parking lot where our luggage was taken from us (and brought to the hotel via boat). Our escort walked us to the hotel which is located right on the canal. The walk was my first glimpse of Venice and was just enough to entice me. Check in was easy and courteous. The staff was friendly and provided us with a map and some general information about the points of interest. Our rooms were not immediately available (it was early) so we chose to walk around. The hotel is about a 15+ minute walk from San Marco's square which may not please everyone. My family thoroughly enjoys walking so the trek through the winding streets was very pleasant. San Marco's square is packed with people so we were happy to be a bit removed from it. Later in the day our rooms were ready and were in my opinion very charming. The bathrooms were modern but the rooms themselves maintained period charm. Furniture was antique style and each room was distinct. Our room had a window facing the back of the hotel and at night was quieter than I expected. The beds were a tad bit hard but having been up for 24+ hours this wasn't much of an issue. The hotel is also located within close proximity to a water taxi stop. This is beneficial if you do not want to walk. We took the water taxi just once and enjoyed the different perspective of the city that it gave us. The hotel provides a breakfast. Breakfast was similar to most European hotel breakfasts. It consisted of a variety of cereals, pastries, yogurt, eggs, fruit and ham. There may have been more but I can't recall. The breakfast was acceptable. Overall our experience with the Carlton was very positive and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.", "Date": "December 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "MO", "Title": "\u201cNice and Easy\u201d", "Author": "BAIC03", "ReviewID": "UR22390989", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this hotel for our one-night stay before we caught our cruise ship the next day.

(I find they are always nicer when you speak even the smallest amount of thier language). We had a large bed in a small room- but I was pleased... usually you get a very tiny bed in Europe. We had a big bathroom with nice hot water and great pressure-- even had a towel warmer. The bathroom door was a thick piece of glass-- so not for the modest! We were upgraded to a Canal View room, which is very nice, but yes, it is noisy. Bring your ear plugs just in case because we discovered the hotel is across the canal from the train station, so you hear the water taxis working all night. BUT- we were so jet lagged, we didn't notice! There are shutters on each window so you can keep the noise out more if you like. Breakfast was much more than continental with very strong coffee that I wish I had at home! There were ham and eggs, cereal bagels, kippers and other things beyond what we have in the US. Great. Also, we found a great little pizza joint about 50 yds to the left of the hotel. He hand-made the pizza in about 10 min and it cost us 10 Euro.

From the airport we caught the No 5 bus to central Venice and when we arrived at piazzle Roma bus terminal, it was a 5 minutes walk. The number of tourists carrying luggage and struggling across all the bridges in Venice to reach their hotels , made me realise how lucky we were to get a hotel so conveniently located to the bus terminal. Every one is right in saying that the hotel is a bit further away from St Marks square. But the vaporetto ( water bus) station is just opposite the hotel and the walk ( which is about 20-25 min) to the square is very interesting with alot of shops, cafe's and restaurants. Souvenir shop items tend to get a bit cheaper away from St Marks square towards the hotel too. The hotel it self was very good. Helpful staff, rooms were certainly larger than we expected and toilet was so spacious and clean ( which was so great!) . The breakfast buffet was also good with alot of healthy choices. The 48 or 72 hour ticket works out alot cheaper than paying individual fares and if possible try to get this at the airport it self. We managed to do a gondola ride for 70 euros. Having inquired in many places the standard price seemed to be around 80euros before 7pm and 100 euros thereafter. We went around half six in the evening and it was really nice. Please do hire cycles for as cheap as 3 euros and do a tour around Lido, it's well worth it.

This can be bought from the airport and enables tyou to transfer to Pizalle Roma ( bus station) which is a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Once youve seen all the sights and got blisters on your feet - I would also recommend a trip on the vaperetto out to \" The Lido\" - which is a simply fantastic sandy beach on the Adriatic - which we wish we could have found a little sooner in our 4 day break as it was a perfect spot to relax and unwind.", "Date": "April 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "jersey channel islands", "Title": "\u201cGood Venice Hotel\u201d", "Author": "gemsrp", "ReviewID": "UR15101955", "Content": "Stayed at the Hotel Carlton and Grand Canal 7th to 10th April. I took my mum for her 60th Birthday but it was our second trip to Venice. We booked through Ryan Air and flew with them from Liverpool to Treviso so got a discount on the normal hotel rate. If you want a Grand Canal View you have to book a deluxe room and request the view. We did and it was worth it, you do feel part of Venice when you overlook the canal. (If it is your first time in Venice I advise you fly to Marco Polo and arrive by water, it's the best way to arrive for your first visit in this amazing city), getting the coach from Treviso to Piazza Roma just isn't the same but we didnt mind as it was our second time around. The Hotel is undergoing renovation but this didn't affect our stay. Staff are polite and helpful, breakfast was more than adequate and the bar is open all day (many of the smaller hotels in Venice do not have a bar service until 6pm) this was great, we came back around 4pm everyday and ordered tea in the lounge with a piece of almond cake which was lovely. If you arrive at Piazza Roma, exit the square canal side and go over a bridge to your left to join the Grand Canal on the righthandside and walk about 100 metres and the hotel is there on your right. There are two bridges in total to arrive at the hotel so not too bad with the luggage. Our room was quite small but a lot of hotel rooms in Venice are, it was more than adequate and the maids left the room absolutely spotless everyday. Beds were comfy and there was a good shower and bath. We didn't dine in the hotel so can't comment. We paid approx \u00c2\u00a3650 for three nights.

We found the hotel to be very clean and the staff were very helpful and polite. Breakfast is more than adequate with lots to choose from; the breakfast staff were polite and kept the supplies well stocked. I must admit having read some previous reviews which didn't paint a good picture of the hotel we were a little sceptical. However, we found everything about the hotel excellent. There was no mould in our room and although the room was not huge, it was more than adequate. All rooms are now fitted with a safe. A hairdryer was fitted in the bathroom which worked adquately. The hotel is situated directly opposite the railway station and is also only a very short walk from the bus station (less than 5 minutes). There is a vaparetto stop opposite the hotel. We found it to be in the perfect location because it was easy to get from the airport via bus or train. We purchased a 72 hour bus ticket which cost 31 Euro's each and it was worth it. This allows you unlimited use of the vaparetto (water bus) and also allows you to get the bus from the airport to the hotel and vice a versa. This ticket is easily purchased at the airport (if you are worried about the language do not panic because they speak English). Venice is a very small place and I would recommend you pack flat comfortable shoes for walking; we did a lot of walking and loved every minute of it - we did get lost a few times but were soon able to find our way around easily. Gondola rides can be expensive. We paid 80 Euro's for a gondola ride from San Marco (St. Mark's Square). It was a lovely sunny day and we were lucky because it was just the two of us (very romantic). You probably can pay less for a gondola ride if you are prepared to share your gondola - we did see some of them with around 8 people sharing. Our gondalier took us under the Bridge of Sigh's and was able to explain other landmarks to us. We visited the famous \"Harry's Bar\" and I must say it isn't much. It is very very expensive. A glass of bellini cost 15 Euro's each - you can buy a whole bottle of bellini from the local shops in Venice for 6.50 Euro's. We certainly couldn't afford to eat there because on looking at the menu you should expect to pay between 90 - 150 Euro's per person. Saying that, the staff in Harry's Bar were very polite and helpful. We loved our stay in Venice and at the Hotel Carlton and Grand Canal and would certainly recommend this for a short break.

There was a bit of building work going on but it was unobtrusive and didn't inconvenience us at all. Took the good look of the front of the Hotel. Breakfast was a superb continental buffet. Very attentive staff kept replenishing the buffet and our coffee. Drinks in the bar were expensive but fairly consistent of food and drinks prices across Venice. Delivery by boat obviously adds to costs. Hotel organised a free water taxi to the island of Murano to a tour of a Glass Factory. Showed very little of the glass production and plenty of the showroom. Pretty spectacular stuff at matching prices. Didn't feel pressure to buy though but was able to buy a similar piece to one we liked in another Glass shop down the steet for substantially less.

The non discounted price of a 72 hour card is 31 euros. This ticket is defenty worth buying.

Size - I was expecting a tiny room from the reviews, but I was more than surprised - plenty of room in both the bedroom and in the bathroom - more than adequate for us using it as a base to go out exploring. 2. Noise - yes you can hear some noise from the corridors outside, but it didn't lessen the experience - if you're a light sleeper it could possibly be a problem, but it didn't bother us. 3. View - We didn't have a view overlooking the canal, but that wasn't important to us - it was a crisp cold weekend, so we didnt have the windows open anyway. If we wanted a view of the grand canal, then we got one when we left the hotel anyway. 4.

I immediately went down to reception with my confirmation and was shrugged at a few times before being told that they were full and there was nothing they could do but if I paid another 120 euro per night I could upgrade!!!!! You can imagine my response!!! The glass bathroom door opposite the room door does not provide any privacy whatsoever. The shower was very small and shallow hence it kept over flowing and flooding the bathroom then the shower curtain would stick to you! Gross!!! However, Venice is an absolute fabulous place.

The lobby was nice and well lit. But our room was a little different. we were on the second floor (or to the Italians, the first floor - the ground floor is usually considered 0 floor) so it was a quick flight up. The elevators are SMALL and can take a while. Walking to find our room - the halls were very narrow and I have to admit it reminded me of a scene from 'The Shining'. My first impressions of the room were dark and grungy (could've been the effect of the fabric walls) - but after a bit, I got used to it. It had a lot of character - very historic, 'venetian' feel. Bathrooms were clean but narrow. The room had a mini bar and small flat panel TV - which offered Pay-Per-View - recent movies cost 10 euros. Buffet breakfast was included in our stay and it was alright - small selection of breads, croissants, cold cuts and cheeses. There was also sausages, bacon and eggs - the breakfast area is also pretty small - so if there are a number of tour groups in one morning, go early to grab a table. It was on the canal which was nice - walking distance to restaurants and shops. But to get to the tourist attractions - St. Mark's Sqaure, Doges' Palace, high end shopping, etc, you will have to take a water bus all the way to the other end of the canal. It takes about 45 minutes and costs about 6 euros. The hotel is across from train station - Ferrovia - so its easy to remember when to get off the waterbus. Service was not that great - no sense of urgency with any requests - could be the hotel or just the laid back demeanor of Europe.

We dedided to eat in the restaurant and asked if they had chicken wings (I know!) and garlic bread as we just wanted something like that, and the chef said 'we do everything' LIE LIE LIE. The chicken wings were just some horrible chicken dish which he charged me as another main course, and the steak my boyfriend ordered was absolute muck.

The staff and the hotel were very helpful in taking care of our luggage after if was dropped off via the boat transfer. The staff helped up book a 2 hour Venice Tour. We were able to walk to the start of the tour at St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square from our hotel. They also arranged our Gondola Tour. It was nice buy pricey 100E, but it was a set-price so I felt better about that. It truly was a great experience for my husband and me! My only regret is that we only stayed (1) night in Venice. I thought the room and bathroom were a decent size and was clean and was pleased overall. Being American I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not a big fan of (2) twin beds pushed together, but can deal with it. They also had a decent breakfast that was included. We had some coffee and cereal and some croissants. I did read there were many negative reviews, but for our needs this hotel was good.

After a long journey on foot from St Marks Square we found the hotel at the northern end of the Grand Canal. A porter showed us our room and imagine my disappointment when there was no canal view. I immediately phoned reception who told me that there was nothing they could do to provide us with a canal view. The room was very small but was decorated beautifully in the Venetian style. Breakfast was a big disappointment given that this hotel was rated at 4 star I expected a typical hot and cold all you can eat buffet. The bread was extremly stale and when I requested fresh bread was given a blank look from the head waiter. The scrambled egg was made from egg powder, the bacon was very greasy and appeared uncooked.

We were grateful for this after seeing hundreds of tourists lugging cases on and off the vaporetti and over bridges. The vaporetto stop, Ferrovia, is opposite the hotel and you can get onto several routes from this. The general area of the hotel is interesting with loads of character and plenty of locals not just piles of tourists. We walked to St Mark's in about 20 minutes (faster than the vaporetto). Rooms were spotless, with all linen changed daily. Staff were invariably friendly and helpful, and any requests were dealt with immediately eg booking concert tickets and a guided tour. We travelled as a party of two couples, one pair over 80, and the staff were very kind. My parents were given a ground floor room with access to an inner courtyard, shared with a few other rooms but not used by any other guests (great for reading or sittting and tucking into fresh fruit and other snacks). We found the hotel very quiet, apart from a very few guests who talked loudly after a couple of drinks - but that was no fault of the hotel! Breakfast was plentiful and staff were attentive, with unlimited tea, coffee etc being offered. The bar staff were very friendly, with amazing memories for our personal preferences, and I was presented with lovely fruit as a late night snack once the lady found out I liked it. My room was very small, but we asked the reception staff to change it, and they said \"Just pack your things and leave it to us\". When we returned after a day out, our bags had been transferred to a bigger room. I noticed some staff at breakfast producing toast (it wasn't out on display) for guests who asked for it, also specialist teas. My advice would be, if you are not pleased with any service, you should make your point and not just moan. This was our first time in Venice and it was a memorable experience, all aspects positive, even the heavy downpour of rain on a few days, which we were lucky enough to watch from bars and restaurants (quite a sideshow). TOP TIPS Travel very light. The most important items are comfy shoes. Venice is a city so don't dress for the beach. Tshirts and shorts will be unsuitable for entry into churches and St Mark's. It's useful to have a cardigan or light jacket. You can buy cheap umbrellas at stalls on the street, or take your own. If you enjoy concerts, book tickets at one of the churches or concert halls. We went to two, and they were excellent and only about \u00c2\u00a325 each. We saw scenes from La Traviata in a real palazzo, only about 50 seats available and the audience moves through the rooms with the cast. Fantastic!! To get to St Mark's cross the big bridge near the hotel, turn right and walk straight down the wide pedestrian street. It should take about 20 minutes. If you want something a bit different, stop off and visit the mummified body of Santa Lucia in the church as you pass. If you are put off by the queues for St Mark's basilica, book a guided tour. When you get in after about 30 minutes of the tour (without queueing) just drop out of the party so you can be amazed for longer. Try to see St Mark's square when the water is high and watch some tourists wading barefoot. The Accademia is brilliant. The Peggy Guggenheim collection is also smashing, with a nice cafe. For a really good value and lively place to eat, go to Brek near the hotel and have a meal for about a fiver or a tenner if you want salmon (includes dessert). This place is fantastic for vegetarians, as the salad bar is basically eat as much as you can pile in a bowl. The pre-filled salad bowls are HUGE and cost about 3.60 euros. DON'T go to the pizza place along the street, the one with big dark green canopies!! The proprietor will try to entice you in but we thought the service was poor. If you don't want to splash out on a gondola ride, use the gondola crossing the canal at the back of the fish market - it costs 50 cents.", "Date": "June 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cSmall rooms, very noisy...\u201d", "Author": "gelati07", "ReviewID": "UR7395092", "Content": "Small room.. friendly staff, good breakfasts... pretty clean (although the dirty towel hanging on the hook when we arrived stayed in the same place for three days - cleanliness test failed) - but incredibly noisy - like living in a tenement - get to know your neighbours - all your neighbours - all about your neighbours - some nice folks from Georgia (USA) turned up about mid-night, and the old boy was still telling jokes at 2am - the women were still laughing.... and that was 5 doors away... right in the heart of the tourist action, but not the most attractive part of Venice.... plenty of other and much better places to stay and it's worth checking them out....probably a good bet for a really early or really late train.. but otherwise go elsewhere....", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel!

Get a 3 day ticket and go by boat to St. Marks etc, its stunning from the water. Venice is very expensive, and average for food unless you pay loads. Now the downside. On our third night we were woken at 3.30am by the occupants of the room below us, we looked out over the courtyard. They were having a very noisy party, laughing loud, smoking cannabis, the stink was really strong, their window wide open. Very loud american voices. I rang reception and told them, and my husband went down eventually and knocked on the door and complained. We heard other people knocking on the door after my husband. The american bloke who answered the door just said its cool, when my husband asked him to keep quiet. Eventually they shut their window and quietened down. Needless to say we were exhausted on our last day. How inconsiderate can you get! Yes they may have been jet lagged, but this should not stop you from considering other people. In the morning the hotel staff had to clean all their ash and butts from the courtyard. There is a glass panel going all around the court yard at 1st floor level, and it was covered in mess, the porter had to get a ladder and equipment to clean it.

First-off know that whenver you pick a place to stay the photographs/website/brochure are generally going to look a lot glitzzier than the real thing. That being said, however, we were not dissappointed with our choice. The hotel's front rooms/reception area are very elegantly appointed. Don't let your heart sink into your shoes when you see the building's facade. Most buildings in Venice look a little long in the tooth - they have, after all, been standing there for hundereds of years...that's part of the charm of this place! We didn't go for a large room or suite, figuring we'd be out touring a lot - and because of a tight budget and horrible exchange rate! - but were pleasanlty suprised with the space we had and the large bathroom. We appreciated the Venetian decor as well.The buffet breakfast served is really excellent with everything from cereals, yoghurt and fresh fruit to eggs, bacon, cold-meats, cheeses and various breads (a choice not experienced by us in other European hotels before). This hotel is in a really great loaction when you consider you can't just catch a taxi (of the wheeled variety...) from the airport to your front door. A quick walk from the Paizzale Roma - the furthest point cars and busses from the mainland can go - and you're there. No need to lug your bags up and down a zillion stairs or bridges. The hotel is also right opposite the train station (not anywhere as unsightly or noisy as this sounds) and a vaporetti landing stage (Ferrovia) so getting around is really easy. Ofcourse, walking is the best way to see Venice and there are many charming little streets to wander near the hotel. I've heard many complain of the noise when in Venice but do bear in mind that this is a city that lives on the water and so obviously the waterways are going to be busy late into the night and in the early hours of the morning with general traffic and deliveries. Canal facing rooms will bear the brunt of this so we were happy to forgo the view and have a slightly quieter spot overlooking a back street and rooftops. As a light-sleeper I always travel with a good set of ear-plugs and the hotel does have great shutters you can close over the windows to block out the early morning light and much of the noise as well (I don't think the front rooms have the same shutters we had though). The only drawback for us is that we did not feel especially welcome...Some reviewers of this hotel commented positively on the friendliness of the staff but for us, apart from one or two helping in the breakfast area and one of the barmen who did manage to smile now and then, we actually found the complete opposite. The reception staff were particularly cold and unfriendly to the point where we were hesistant to ask them anything! Their attitudes had the potential to make our stay there quite unpleasant but we managed to look past them and enjoy the city we had come to explore. Venice is a truly magical place, and if you're looking for a clean, comfortable place to stay with a good breakfast and a great location, then this hotel is definitely an option.

There is a main vaporetto stop right outside the hotel so the entire city can be reached quickly. But don't immediately jump on the boats - there are so many diffferent ways to walk into St Marks and you see so much more of the real city on foot.

Nice extras such as decent bathrobes and slippers - but not sure whether these are limited to just the suites. The lobby, restaurant and bar were all well decorated and maintained. The other communal areas (such as the hallways) were in real need of some attention. Nothing that a lick of paint and a new carpet wouldn't sort out, but it did let the hotel down a little.

We flew with Ryan air because it was the cheapest, but I don't think I will fly with them again. Ryan air flies into Treviso airport which is more like a shoe box than an airport. Then you take a bus for an hour to get into Venice. Our hotel was near where the bus depot was so that wasn't a problem. But for the journey back it only took us 30 minutes by bus and we thought that was great, until we were made to wait in line for an hour and fifteen minutes because they didn't open the check out desk when the three buses arrived. They were not helpful or nice at the airport. I will not fly with Ryan air again because of this. There service in Venice Treviso Airport was terrible. We stayed at the Hotel Carlton and Grand Canal across from the Ferriovia, train station. It was a nice area and we enjoyed the hotel. The room was very small, but clean and the only stations they had in English were CNN, Eurosport, and pay channels. We got very tired of CNN. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the hotel was nice. We would recommend it for people travelling to Venice. It served our purposes just fine. They also provide you with a free trip to the island of Murano. It is the island where they make all the the glass. You get a tour of the factory and are led into 9 show rooms with examples of the glass made there. You are obviously encouraged to buy, but not too forcefully. While the glass is beautiful it is very expensive. Be prepared to leave your first born child. For a dish the size of a side plate it cost about seventy euros. But if you do want something small when you leave the showroom and go to the water bus area there are vendors there selling smaller versions and wine stoppers, glasses, plates, etc. for much cheaper. And also much cheaper than buying it from a shop in Venice. We bought a beautiful wine stopper for five euros on the island from a vendor and saw a siimilar one at a Venice vendor selling for fifteen euros. We also visited the island of Lido. I would recommend this to anyone. The island is beautiful and it has a wonderful sand beach that is quite big and not crowded. You must visit and bring your suits and towels and spend an afternoon here. There is also a golf course and driving range on this island, and you can rent canoes and boats to go out into the water. As for the rest of Venice. It is an experience. There is no where else in the world like it. We did the Original Venice Walk and it was very good. We learned a lot about the history and didn't have to wait in line in St. Marks. But you only do a quick run through of St. Marks. So if you want a more time to look around and explore the church I suggest you do that on your own. The Doge's Palace is next to St. Marks and well worth going in. You can book a tour called the Secret Itineraries tour through the hotel and it is great. They take you into the secret passages, and offices within the palace. You actually get to see where Casanova was imprisioned and made his escape. With that ticket you also get into the palace for free. It costs sixteen euros. Be prepared to spend at least 50 euros per meal and closer to 75-100 for dinners. It is better to try to find restaurants hidden away from the tourist sites down the back streets. Drinks are extremely expensive. For a can of diet coke it can cost anywhere from 3-4 euros per can. Starters are also expensive, ex. parma ham and melon will cost you 12 euros, but it is worth it. Venice is a beautiful city, but it is very expensive. Definately not a cheap holiday. As for travelling around the water bus is the cheapest option. But it does take a long time for the journey from the Ferrovia to Saint Marks. It is often faster to get off at Rialto and walk the 5-10 minutes to San Marco, as opposed to the 20 minute journey on the water bus. It is definately worth riding along the canal once so you can take in the wonderful buildings and history. But it is more fun to walk through the narrow streets and get lost. The city is not that big and you can pretty much walk anywhere within 30-45 minutes, just bring your walking shoes and some water as it gets very hot and humid in the summer.", "Date": "August 21, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "LONDON", "Title": "\u201cJust Right !\u201d", "Author": "ALIMEFO", "ReviewID": "UR5598461", "Content": "We stayed at this Hotel last weekend, the location although is not in the heart on Venice is by the Grand Canal and with the waterbus ticket we could get easily anywhere within minutes, even if we decide to go by walking to Saint Marks Square for instance it was so easy because they are plenty of signals on the streets about how to get anywhere and within half an hour we were right in the main places.

One bridge and your at the hotel and one bridge was enough for us to pull the suitcases over. The hotel is a twenty minute walk to San Marco and Rialto bridge.

It was easier and quicker to walk and more interesting to wander and meander around the tiny streets and see the real venice beyond the tourist packed traditional root of the grand canal.

After reading some other reviews about the hotel it was far from being on my list of top hotels to stay at in Venice. But we took a chance and I am pleased that we did. You may think that the hotel is far from the main attractions in Venice, but it's not. Venice isn't that big and you can walk to St Mark's square in half an hour - but I'd suggest you take longer as the walk there is just as much fun as seeing the beautiful cathederal. I loved our walks to and from the hotel - we never went the same way twice! Also being away from the attractions you'll find cheaper and more authentic food. For everyone who says Venice is expensive, that's because they must have been shopping and eating at all the expensive places. You can happily buy a meal for 2 and spend about \u00c2\u00a320 (including wine). Of course if you want a 3 course dinner and all the trimmings it's going to cost you more, but if a bowl of pasta or a pizza is enough to fill you up, you'll have a very cheap stay in Venice. We splashed out on our last night in Venice and did spend a fortune but I couldn't have done that every night. This hotel gives you the opportunity of looking around Venice from a different angle, although the main attractions aren't on your doorstep you'll see so much more than if you just stayed at St Marks square. The hotel offered free tickets to the Casino, and a free trip to a glass blowing factory on Murano island. We took advantage of both! The casino is just a short walk (or water bus ride) away. And the hotel actually arrange a private water taxi to the glass blowing factory. We wanted to go to the factory on the Sunday and as no one else from the hotel was going we had the whole place to ourselves. It seemed as if they'd opened the factory and lit the furnace just for us. The staff at the factory were lovely, they spoke excellent english (as did all the hotel staff) and seemed perfectly happy to show us around - although I suspect the tour is aimed more at groups not couples. The receptionist Lisa was very helpful in particular and was very patient explaining where to catch a waterbus and the best tickets to buy.

Also, the \"patio\" could have used some plants and such. Some details and caveats: - The voltage is 220v throughout, so, bring your transformers/adapters (also for the round plugs that they use there) - As most European hotels, they provide no American-style washcloths, so, if you're used to them for shaving and/or showering, bring your own. - Limited TV offerings in English (not terribly important, as you are not there to watch TV anyway!) - VERY limited closet space Summarizing: If this hotel were located anywhere near the Piazza San Marco area, it would be a nice place to stay.

San Marco is about a 20 minute walk away through a maze of narrow streets, but it is a really fun walk and you get to explore where the locals live, occasionally meeting a dead end or better yet, yet another canal.

In general, European hotels are known for having smaller rooms, but this takes the cake. The room we had was very...TINY! We had two twin beds put together and we had requested a King Bed. Second, don't believe anything about Satellite TV because it doesn't exist there. Also, the bathroom was as big as a portapotty. The hotel did not provide AC because of ongoing construction, but was necessary because it was warmer than usual for this time. There are a few things going good at the hotel. The breakfast was very good! They provided a variety of selections of food to eat. However, the eggs were made with olive oil, but still edible. The location is excellent because it's right across from the Train Station. It gives the tourist the opportunity to tour Venice as a whole rather than stay near St. Mark Square and not walk very much. Overall, I won't stay here again.

Deduct 1 or 1 1/2 stars from the hotel rating and well, there you go. For instance, 5 stars can either be a 4 star or a 3 1/2 star...you get the picture. And now my review, the Carlton is a decent place to stay if you are not too high-maintenance and do not require undivded attention from the staff. I am a newlywed, the room I stayed in with my husband was very very quaint (1 very small room, a bathroom). It had 2 twin beds...yes two twin! When we asked if we can have one single big bed the staff member shrugged his shoulders and simply said...\"It wasn't required\". When asked how to use the air conditioning, they told us that it wouldn't be available till May 15th...mind you we arrived May 1st. They weren't the most helpful staff in the world, but at the same time they weren't complete -----. In terms of location, I thought this is where we lucked out. It is directly on the canal, and if you get lucky and get a room with a view I'm sure your stay will be more pleasant. It was also in the vicinity of a whole bunch of affordable restaurants (Go to Pedrocchi's) and small shops. If you are planning to travel within Italy by train, the train station is directly across the hotel. Only thing is you have to haul your luggage over this huge foot bridge which isn't fun, but do-able. The main tourist attraction here is St. Marks square which from the hotel is an easy trip by vaporetto (water bus) for 5 euro or, if you have 80 euro to throw away, by water taxi. You will quickly see how expensive Venice is once you reach the St. Mark's area. You will quickly be thankful you spent your hard-earned dollars in a moderate hotel further from St. Mark's than closer, because the same money closer to the square will get you a room 1/2 the size of that in the Carlton. Whether you chose the Carlton or not, if you're budgeting, and you really should...I would suggest a hotel further away from St. Mark's, you will see the difference in price, surroundings and convenience.", "Date": "May 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cWhere do they get 4 stars from?\u201d", "Author": "dassie", "ReviewID": "UR3317765", "Content": "Absolutely the worst hotel we stayed in during a three week, three country business/holiday trip to Europe. The location is not bad. Lots happening in the area and convenient for the station. Beware if you're dragging a heavy suitcase as you will have carry it over a steep foot bridge. Rooms: Awful. Old fashioned, faded, dark and drab. Cheap blankets on the beds, why not duvets? 1 thin pillow per person. A view of what looked like the heating/air-conditioning equipment. Plastic shower curtains over the bath, why not sliding glass doors? Cheap plastic beakers for drinking water, why not real glass? Breakfast: Limited choice of cereals, limited choice of cold meats and cheeses, tinned 'fresh' fruit salad, stale breads. Self service tea and coffee from a machine. Pre-made scrambled eggs which looked disgusting. Staff rushing around far too busy to give a simple 'good morning', but not too busy to keep up non stop chattering to each other at the top of their voices. And to top it all to see one of the staff members sweep up spilled muesli with her hands and then put the muesli back into the top of the container is, too say the least, pretty unhygenic. Tourist info? City Map? Day tour brochures? Forget it! Go to the equally unhelpful staff at the information desk at the station. Internet access? Forget that too. Not available. Go to the nearest internet cafe. I suppose I should be happy that I at least got directions. This is not a 4 star hotel. The rooms, the breakfast, the facilities and, least of all, the staff are nowhere near 4 star standard.

Bathroom was modernized with an excellent shower. Only bad point was that the double bed was actually two beds pushed together. Location for some could be its downside. It is about 20 minutes walk to the Rialto bridge and another 10 to St Marks Square. However for us this was not a problem - Venice is the perfect city for just wondering and getting lost down the little streets and alley ways. Being slightly futher from the main attractions also meant we were able to dine in less touristy (and expensive!) resturants.
