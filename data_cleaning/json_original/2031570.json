Kowloon is more convenient for me to stay as it is close to my business, and I have been staying at the Regent/Intercontinental for 20 years. With all of the construction, i decided to try some of the new hotels in Kowloon the last couple of trips. A couple of months back, I took my wife to the new Ritz-Carlton, which we enjoyed. This trip, based on the great Tripadvisor reviews, I decided to try the Icon. I will start with my only negative, which is the location. It is right in TST east, which for some people may be fun, but it is a bit too far east for my taste. It is near the train station and the museum, so for some people that would be a plus. The people working at this hotel were terrific. they are all quite young and a little less formal than is normal in Hong Kong. The feel was more \"California\" than the stiff formality of Hong Kong. i found that refereshing. The rooms was very nice. brand new, great bed and pillows. I stayed on the club floor, which was a great choice as they have a GREAT breakfast buffet at The Market restaurant. The pool is very cool and there are always a lot of people hanging out at the pool and pool bar. I probably would not have stayed at this hotel had i not seen the tripadvisor reviews. so THANKS TO ALL. you really cant go wrong here.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201ca real 5*\u201d", "Author": "niallp", "ReviewID": "UR139989823", "Content": "I really felt like I was staying at a 5*.

Travel Purpose: We were staying in HK for a week, and wanted to try this hotel on the last night, so we have a reference for another hotel in HK Location: not so good. HK is a very safe place, but you cant help feeling the seedy side of things in east TST area. Saying that if you want to catch the bars and more night life in TST the place to be. Price: We have to say it is up there with other high standard hotel, which it deserves to be, but for us we would rather stay at another place based on location Cleanliness Overall exceptionally clean, with it being a new hotel it was expected, but i am sure the staff aim to maintain that Other points: very friendly staff breakfast was nice, with a good variety (some halal options is you are interested). It was 198HKD per person free internet, woop woop Swimming pool and gym are very cool. The pool is on the 9th floor, so while you swim you see really are up there over seeing HK, and feeling like the master of the universe (well, maybe his accountant) Restaurants - They have a few restaurants, unfortunately we did not try them (other than the breakfast place) but they did look interesting View - As mentioned from the pool and the rooms, the view of HK is pretty sweet!! Conclusion: It did win the trip advisor 2012 award, and deserves it. They are a very cool hotel and glad we stayed there, but I dont know if we would stay again unless the rates were very competitive and simply because of location.

We were personally escorted from the lobby to the 28th floor. Excellent! The gentleman who assisted us explained everything regarding the benefits of staying in the Club room, double checked our personal information, etc. All very nice and professional 3. The room was the Club 80 Suite. What can I say... it's just amazing. I can't fault anything. The amenities, the furniture, the finishing detail, the bed... and the view. Wow! Mind Blowing! The view over Central was just so beautiful we decided to leave the curtains open all night because the windows allowed for a panoramic view. To wake up and watch the sun rises from such height (we stayed on the 20th floor) set the good mood for the whole day. The master bathroom with big bath tub, raindrop shower, and massive window was also very much appreciated. We can take everything from the mini-bar,the cookies jar, mineral water bottles that were available everywhere. The wi-fi signal was also very strong. Big closet, ironing board, massive HD TV. Where do I stop now? :) 4. Swimming pool is awesome too. While it's not olympic size, it's nicely heated and just the right size to have a quick dip. the view was again.. AMAZING! the gym was equipped with complete equipments and very well-maintained. 5. We could choose to have breakfast either at the Above & Beyond Club on the 28th floor or at the Market on the 2nd floor. We chose to have breafkast at the Market and we were satisfied. Food was good and abundant. Quality is also good! 6. We had the chance to try the happy hour on the 28th floor. Drinks were plenty and the finger foods available while not much tasted good!! 7. The staff are young. Later on I found out many of them are still doing their internships from a nearby university. They all speak English very well, very attentive, informative, and very friendly. 8. The hotel is easily reached from the airport. There are so many options one can choose to reach the hotel. We chose to take the Airport Express to Kowloon Station and from there we took the K3 shuttle bus. All in all, it took us about 1 hour to reach the hotel and vice versa. 9. The TST east MTR station is not as close to the hotel as I thought. It takes a good 10 minutes to walk to the station. Actually it's faster to take the taxi to go to Central because the tunnel that connects Kowloon and Hong Kong Island is just behind the hotel. All in all, we are two happy guests.

Our plane arrived early Monday evening during the recent Typhoon Vincente, luckily we had booked the Hotel car to collect us from the airport as category 8 means taxis are not insured and buses/trains were out. Our car driver picked his way through the debris and very wet roads to deliver us safely to the haven that is Hotel Icon. The fantastic Hotel staff rushed out to greet us and escort us safely inside and collected our bags. Once inside Raymond took control explaining the seriousness of the situation without alarming us. He then escorted us to our room on the 26th floor (Club 36), explained all we needed to know and left us feeling welcome and relaxed while outside the tempest grew. The room had the most amazing view across the harbour to the spectacular lights of HK island. It was spacious, clean, modern, with the most comfortable beds, crisp linen, fluffy towels and up-to-date amenities. Deep bathtub, groovy shower with rain or handheld shower heads. Free mini bar with chocs and soft drinks (no alcohol - didn't matter as Club room has free cocktails for 2 hrs each night in the sumptuous Above & Below Lounge). We found the room very quiet, no neighbor noise at all, air con was quiet and very little to worry us during 150km/hr winds! As we were advised to remain inside for at least the next 12hrs we headed for the 28th floor to Above & Beyond Lounge. Typhoon had now reached Cat10 and it was clear we were in the best place to watch it happen around us. We hadn't made a booking at the restaurant however the staff did their best to arrange a table, following, cocktails in the lounge. We enjoyed the crispy skin duck and chilli prawns - delicious. As morning broke it was evident by the lack of traffic on the roads the typhoon while abating was still posing a threat and it wasn't safe to emerge so we booked into the Angsana Spa - possibly the best massage I've ever had. As mentioned in previous posts the hotel is run by the Polytechnic University. The staff are young, energetic, friendly interns and post-grads who cannot do enough for their guests, always smiling and making you feel at home. So refreshing from the stuffy establishments who trade on their names only. During our stay we were asked to complete a couple of research surveys for the students and researchers from the Uni. We were happy to participate, even reviewing a 'concept' room the hotel was trialling with new products/amenities to make guests stay even more comfortable. We visited the Marketplace Restaurant for breakfast each morning and also for their buffet dinner. While breakfast was included in our room rate we found the buffet dinner expensive and were disappointed the staff were packing up and clearing away half an hour before close. It makes guests who do eat late feel a little harried. We didn't eat at Green but it looked great. We had a busy time in HK and at the end of each day were glad to return to our room - our haven from the vibrant yet busy streets. Throughout our stay the staff always asked us if we required assistance in planning our day, gave us some great tips - really doing their best to make us feel so special :) The comments regarding location initially worried us when looking for a hotel, however with the hotel shuttle leaving every 20 mins, dropping off behind The Peninsula Hotel or at Harbour City, taxis at the doorstep and really a very easy 10min walk down Granville Rd with some great shops to Nathan Rd we found the location not an issue at all. We even headed to the Temple St night markets, caught a taxi there for $HK25 and easily walked back to hotel after midnight without any issues.

The timeless room was nice, with television and nice coffee and I got a chance to take a shower. Once waited 3 hours I went back to the reception and got the room I wanted in the first place. The room was very nice, with great view. And although the minibar items where free, I found the minibar not very well equipped. What I liked about the room was the view overlooking the skyline of HK and the bathroom with separate bath and shower.

This is by far the most responsive and helpful hotel i have come across. From initial enquiries about ajoining/adjacent rooms (for my 2 children), to discussing best way to get there, booking a table at restaurant on first evening, the response was very quick (less than an hour in all cases) informative and polite. This was seen through our visit until leaving. the staff were all incredibly friendly, helpful and polite, which was a pleasant change to the hustle of most of the hong kong population. As mentioned by several reviewers, the hotel is also a training hotel for the hospitality industry courses at the local polytechnic and this would also account for the youth of many staff at the hotel. The suite 80 had a fantastic view from the bedroom and lounge which had a full seating area and table, desk etc. By far the best suite i have known in HK when floor space is at such a premium. it also had a great bath with a huge picture window overlooking the harbour (with blinds if you want them) and a strong shower. We found the beds comfortable being medium/firm and the aircon is silent making for a good nights sleep. So there was plenty of space for 4 to relax and use as a base. The rooms are filled with technology, sometimes a bit daunting when late and you just cant turn the lights off. The club 36 city was a decent size room and has a more conventional bathroom. no complaints there. both rooms had good coffee (nespresso) and tea, also a free mini bar with beer and soft drinks. We found the club lounge a little small and if all club level guests turned up for cocktails I suspect they would not all fit in. There was a decent wait to get a drink as they were probably understaffed for the numbers in the lounge. So we tended not to use it as much as we might and i am not sure if we would pay the premium again. We had a meal at the chinese restaurant at above & beyond. The food was good, portion sizes were decent and serving staff ok, if a little too focused on my 15 year old daughter. I was surprised to note that no local food was on the room service menu which i think is a missed opportunity given the in house restaurant. location wise, it is a very short walk to the science and history museums. A bit further to the main shopping areas of Kowloon but there is a regular shuttle bus that solves that issue if you dont like the walk. The upside (or downside depending on what you are looking for) of the location is that is it perhaps a bit quieter than more central locations. Overall I liked this hotel, it may not quite match premium 5 star hotels such as the IC or Four seasons, but with the room sizes and service I dont think you cant find better value for money in HK.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWOW!\u201d", "Author": "DannaSY", "ReviewID": "UR135873307", "Content": "I honestly can't say one bad thing about this hotel.

The view from the ICON 38 Harbour View room on this club floor was awesome. While it did not directly face central Hong Kong, the layout of the room with the huge King bed facing the floor-to-ceiling window more than compensated. The room was spotless, and featured a free Minibar with M&Ms and plenty of drinks and a Nespresso machine, which were all very welcome after a day out in the city. I also enjoyed 'Green' - the cafe in the lobby. It has a really cool feel to it, and while the menu does not have huge variety, it's always a great place to chill out after a big day. Not enough can be said about the service in this hotel - always being greeted with a smile and staff genuinely go that extra mile to make your stay as perfect as possible. Location is quite good - it is about a 5-10 minute walk to the heart of TST. I would recommend catching a taxi to areas in TST, as they are very cheap (approx $20HKD or ~$2.50 AUD for a ride to the Star Ferry Terminal or Harbour City) over using the hotel shuttle bus. Perhaps my only criticism would be of the shuttle bus, as I could not see any defined stops and pick-up points, so I opted for taxis which were always readily available at the front of the hotel.

The view from the full length plate glass windows is just stunning, especially at night when the whole neon vista of Hong Kong island is laid out in front of you. Worth every penny (or every attempt at sweet talking the receptionist when you arrive). This hotel is attached to the Hong Kong School of Tourism and Hotel Management so many of the staff are students who are in training. Others work full time. So you get staff who are invested in the service experience they give. For example, when I checked in i had just 20 mins to find an opticians to fix my glasses. But the concierge didn't just tell me where to go - one of the team escorted me across the road and down another street to the opticians, waited while I sorted out what I needed, helped to translate at one moment and then escorted me back to the hotel. That was great service. The room is nicely designed (you can see the hand of Terence Conran here, who the web site says was one of the designers) and has some nice features you dont' commonly find, like a printer that actually works (you just email an attachment to a certain address).

The staff is very helpful and give a very good service. But the hotel does have some problems: 1) The lobby and facilities are not as pampering as you will find at the ritz, mandarin oriental, etc 2) The Spa was good treatment but not good value for money + the relaxation time (which you pay for) was only at the spa lobby and seemed pointless 3) The location is not great. 15mins-20mins walk from Tsim sham Tsui subway station is not very good, the station next to it (hong kong station) is useless for island travel and the hotel shuttle service compensates just a bit. In conclusion \u2013 the ICON is a very good hotel, especially if you take the club room or suite. I would not take it for a regular room with no breakfast.

The only thing is - half of the hotel room is actually the bathroom, in a circular shape right next to the room entrance, leaving a narrow strip of space for the bed and the study. It's not surprising that the bathroom takes priority in this hotel cause I was told the key designer is the world's famous bathroom designers. The room furniture looks a little cheap to me. The hotel was brand new but I could already see peeling of the strips around the edges of the wooden furniture. The bathroom is in pitch black; It's not really for older folks cause they might not be able to see properly when they are inside. The bathtub however is to die for; it's deep and luxurious. For what it is charging now, I won't stay cause it's not really all that convenient to get to all those happening places in the area. I am not very fond of the Tsimshatsui East area. It's now the older part of Tsimshatsui and the walk underground in the MTR station is long. To me, the staff also wears some rather funny uniform.

Because it was our first time in Hong Kong we reserved a car through the hotel. A big black Mercedes S-Class was waiting at the airport and had us at the hotel in no time. When we pulled up the driver must have called the hotel because someone walked out to greet us BY NAME as we stepped out of the car! She took us straight up to our room where we were checked-in INSIDE OUR ROOM. No waiting at the front desk! If I'm not mistaken... for some reason we were told we had been upgraded to the Icon floor? Our room was on the 25th floor and was far more than we had expected! There was a flat screen above the bathtub, the coolest shower ever, an incredible comfortable bed and a free minibar! We had booked a room with a view of Kowloon instead of Hong Kong Island, because we really didn't know the difference! But we could see both sides of Victoria Harbor from our room! The hotel is close to two subway stops but to get to Hong Kong Island.... you have to walk a good way through the Tsim Tsa Sui Station. The hotel does have a shuttle bus that runs every 20 minutes to three stops around the hotel on Kowloon... and one of those stops is at the Tsim Tsa Sui East station... which if you go there you don't have to do the walking ! (I may not be spelling those names correctly!) Point being the hotel is in a great location in Kowloon.... a short walk to the harbor where you can watch the laser light show every night... short walk to subway stations and sites like the Peninsula Hotel... and literally just steps from all the best museums hong kong has to offer. Everytime we'd come or go someone was always waiting to open the door and tell us how to get where we were going! A typhoon hit one night we were there so we sat in the bar/restaurant on the 27th floor and enjoyed a couple drinks while the storm passed! its an incredible view up there and although we didn't have a meal, the wine was great! The bar in the lobby is also great for that! Unfortunately we didn't have time to enjoy the beautiful pool (which has a great view of Hong Kong Island) or spacious fitness center, because our time was VERY LIMITED and we were trying to hit all the top spots in our guide book. If i had more time it would've been nice to enjoy the pool and soak up the sun while relaxing high about the city! The only complaint about Hotel Icon... and its really more about the subway.... is the subway to Hong Kong Island stops running around 12:45am.... so if you're on Hong Kong Island late at nite you'll have to catch a cab back to Kowloon! Our last night we were out at a club and when the bartender told us this, we rushed back to the subway station to get back in time! We were actually tired and needed to get back..... taking a cab would not have been that difficult and I doubt that expensive? (But I honestly have no clue the cost because we took the subway and buses everywhere.... THE PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEM IN HONG KONG IS INCREDIBLE SIMPLE TO UNDERSTAND! EVEN FOR SOMEONE FROM CALIFORNIA WHO NEVER GETS OUT OF HIS CAR) FOR THE PRICE, I DO NOT SEE HOW HOTEL ICON CAN BE BEAT! Hotels aren't cheap in Hong Kong but our room was under $300 a night and somewhere like Manhattan.... a hotel and room like the one we enjoyed would have been more like $500!

I have stayed here 5 times and every time I check in, it just keeps getting better! Rooms are large (for HK), modern and immaculately clean. Wifi and minibar come free of charge. Bathroom is sexy, although the shower can be a bit tricky. It's almond shaped and it's pretty big, but there's no shower door so if you're not careful, you'll get a flooded bathroom floor. The bath is a bit small, but it's nice and deep. I'm around 5'5'' and the length of the bath is just enough for me to sit up straight with my legs stretched. Don't know how a taller person will manage. Nevertheless, the rooms are slick and sexy and I appreciate the newly installed TVs in the bathroom. Oh and the views are great - regardless of whether you stay in a city or harbour view room. With regards to staff, when I first started staying here, I noticed the doormen, concierge and reception staff were a bit aloof, but I did think that it was due to awkwardness, rather than rudeness. They have since sorted that out. They are now very welcoming and friendly - always smiling. The doormen now say \"welcome back\" when you get back at the end of the day - just that little bit of something that makes one feel at home whilst travelling. Service at the restaurants have been great right from the start and the food in all three restaurants have been outstanding. Although I'm no Chinese food expert, I thought that it was nice to eat dimsum in a fine-dining setting (at Above and Beyond Restaurant), where plates are changed after each dimsum dish. I commented that the walnuts served as appetizers were really good and they gave me a box of walnuts to take away for free. Brilliant service! The \"timeless lounge\" is also another reason why I choose to stay here. My flights out of HK are often scheduled late in the evening and it has always been a problem for me when I used to stay in other hotels. Hotel Icon solves this issue for me by offering a lounge for guests who have checked out. This means I can check out in the morning, go to my meetings, come back to the hotel in the evening, take a shower, blow dry my hair, do my make-up and change into a comfortable outfit for long-haul flights. Much better than doing it in an airport lounge as I can use my own toiletries and not worry about having to pack a travel outfit in my carry-on luggage. Location is good in that it is close to the Hung Hom train station if you have to take a train to China, and there are lots of places to shop and eat across the road, but the MTR is quite far. Don't be fooled by those exits you see on the street. You could walk underground for ages before you see a train. Taxis are dirt cheap though, so I prefer to take taxis rather than the MTR when in Hong Kong. What else can I say?

We reached Hong Kong from Guangzhou in Mainland China by train. I was initially doubtful about getting HK visa on arrival if we travelled by train. Thankfully it was an inspired move and visa was stamped on arrival with no problem. Trains are nice and comfortable and take just 2 hours and cost about 150 Yuan. On the plus side you reach right into the heart of Kowloon straight away compared to the HK airport which is a 200 HKD ride away from the city. You can see the sights on the way far better than if you were on a plane. Due to my mainland China trip taking one more night than planned, I was thinking of to cut short the Hong Kong leg of the trip to just one night, instead of the originally planned 2 nights. I had already shortlisted the hotel from Trip Advisor review and decided to go with Icon for its location, decor (I prefer the modern trendy decor with modern amenities in hotels to the classic style old world charm) and prices. Since my travel plan was not fixed, I could book at Icon only the day before. I was looking for a Icon 36 Harbour View room and to my dismay hotel listed only the higher priced Club suite rooms for the day. I had not budgeted for this and this came on top of the dismay of not getting the early bird 20% discount which is available for 14 days' advance booking. I then decided to book from other sources like hotel.com and they had listed Club 36 rooms as available. I was surprised why the hotel themselves do not have it, while other have. Went back to the hotel website and this time I could book what I wanted! We arrived in the afternoon and check in was very friendly and efficient. I knew the club rooms start from 23rd floor and hence requested if I can get 22nd or 21st floor. They said if I need to check in soon, then only 17th floor was available. If I could wait an hour they will give me 21st floor. Hmm.. I did not want to wait considering I was only there for a night. So took the 17th floor room. The hotel is in Tsim Sha Tsui, which is a central location with the highest concentration of hotels in HK. The Hung Hom MTR station is very near, but accessibility is never an issue with HK anyway. The hotel offers free shuttle to the key tourist areas within Tsim Sha Tsui making it easy for you to plan your trip. Despite the fact the hotel photos of the room view may make you believe you are right in front of the harbor, the hotel is a good 2-3 blocks away from harbor. May be the floors lower than 10th floor do not have any view of the harbor as they are blocked by buildings in the front. The higher floors have unhindered view. So don\u2019t expect harbor view that you can get from say InterContinental Hong Kong which is right at the corner of the Victoria harbor with possibly 270 degree view of the harbor. I had initially eyed the InterContinental but their harbor view rooms were nearly double what Icon HV rooms would cost. IC is also a bit dated compared to the newly built Icon. My first impression of the hotel was very positive, despite the fact the lobby or porch were just good and nothing special as is common with city hotels as opposed to resort hotels. The hotel and its decor is very trendy and modern, something which I found quite likeable. The room was not very big, but roomy enough, very elegantly furnished with quality materials. The amenities were good; the mini bar (no alcohol) was totally free and replenished daily. The view from the 17th floor is quite good, but felt it did not fully represent the best view of the city skyline that is renowned as the best in the world. Having stayed at the Hyatt on the bund at Shanghai, I felt that Shanghai hotel had even better view despite Hong Kong having far better skyline. This is not to say the Icon Harbour View was disappointing, it is just fantastic, but just mentioning that Icon do not have the best location to do justice to the view HK has on offer. Icon of course do not charge as much others hotels who do have such view. What Icon have in plenty, and what raises it a notch above, is of course the service. Smiling, caring, helping, always available and yet unobtrusive, this was the best service we experienced in our entire 13 day trip that included 7 hotels some of them costing more and being rated higher than Icon. Young, enthusiastic, smiling staff are everywhere possibly because the hotel trains a lot of students and the trainees do not betray their rawness. On the contrary I feel the eagerness and freshness of youth rubs in on even the seasoned staff and the result is a perfect marriage of experience and exhuberance. The concierge was fantastic, ready with maps, tips and umbrellas when it rained. We did not try any of the hotel restaurants or pubs, but had in-room dining a couple of times and liked the food. We just went briefly to the pool which is on the 9th floor. The pool is an open terrace one, but is a bit small. The pool is actually closer to the harboor and thus has better view of the harbor and is a nice place to relax. Being small, it can get crowded a bit too soon. Realizing one night is not going to do justice to the Hong Kong city, we extended the stay by one night more. That gave us some breathing space to explore the city further and to spend time to spend at this wonderful hotel. The best part of the stay at the hotel was when we had checked out. We had our flight at 10pm in the night. Hotel readily agreed to extend the check out time from 12 noon to 2pm. The best part is that those who need to check out late can keep the luggages with concierge and get the keycard for the 9th floor. This allows you to use the 9th floor facilities free of cost EVEN AFTER you have checked out. You have thus access to the pool, change rooms, a lounge with free beverages (which include an Espresso machine, tea, water and soft drinks), fruit bowl and comfortable lounge chairs which allows you to stretch your legs while reading magazines which are supply. We could even use the Wi-Fi briefly. This was a very special touch as this allowed us to visit the city for the last time in the noon, then come back by 6pm, freshen up, change the dress and have some coffee and then head for the airport by 7.30pm. I think this is a very nice touch taking care of guests who have already checked out. Well done Icon. This clearly shows Icon do care. As we had our luggage taken into the cab, the staff including receptionist came to inquire about the stay. We said farewell as we would when visiting the friends. Hmm...it was very nice way to end the hectic trip and we were glad we were at the Icon. While the lure of trying a new hotel next time lingers, I would not be unhappy to go back to Icon again. In fact I would look forward to it. Thank you Icon! I would happily recommend this hotel to anyone interested.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, England, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOne of the best hotels I have ever stayed at\u201d", "Author": "Cambridgeguy88", "ReviewID": "UR132665961", "Content": "This new hotel is simply excellent, especially given its price.

Hotel Icon is the worst ever hotel we have stayed at. We always spend good money and stay at high end hotels on our holidays and usually the price we pay reflects the service that we expect. After reading all the reviews on trip advisor we decided to opt for the Hotel Icon over the famous Shangri La. Big Mistake. The allure of staying at this concept hotel as well as the harbor view rooms we decided to pre book and pay for two nights stay. Firstly our flight was delayed from Brisbane and we arrived in HK later than expected and we were at the hotel at 10am. The rudeness of the woman who checked us in will not be forgotten. We were abruptly informed that our check in would be at 2pm. As we had arrived earlier than the check in time and as we were extremely tired after a sitting on a delayed plane for a total of over 9 hours I was prepared to pay a full night stay for the four hours until check in. I was rudely told no. I probed and advised her that we both had a long flight and we just wanted to rest and shower, again this employee disregarded our requests and informed us to take the shuttle bus to the Shopping Centre. Clearly not travelled in her life or inept at understanding that the main concern here is that we want to rest, her attempts to pawn us off until 2pm were quite distasteful. We found her to be unresponsive and rude. We did not want to go shopping nor did we express any desire to but she continually insisted we take advantage of the free shuttle and go to the shopping centre. The fact that we were ready to pay for a room for a few hours as opposed to expecting us to be checked in earlier was clearly above her intelligence. We informed her that we just wanted to rest but she offered no explanation or reason as to why this was not possible. If the hotel were booked up fine we would have gone elsewhere but nothing. Interestingly enough, whilst we were at the desk another guest checked out and stated his room number to which she immediately scribbled down on a check in room card for us. Clearly she was under the impression that we are stupid to not work out that the room she had given us was this other guests and obviously would have taken time to be prepared. In the end she suggested we go up to the lobby on the 9th floor and we can use the showers there. Not having the energy to complain we decided to do this. Why she did not offer this to us in the first place is a mystery. We showered but were left unimpressed by our treatment and to make the situation worse, another guest took offence that we had our luggage with us in the lounge room. There was no facility to iron any of our clothes and furthermore we had to take turns to shower as we had all of our valuables with us. We then decided to leave the hotel and as we had pre paid we decided to return after 2pm. When we arrived I informed the staff member who I believe was Tim a supervisor of some sort of our experience at check in. He was a shining example of natural stupidity. To this day I have never been spoken to in such a patronizing way. I am amazed that someone is prepared to pay this man a wage. I explained to him that I was left unimpressed with the way our check in was handled and wanted some explanation as to why there was no option to even pay for another room. He did manage to tell me that they were fully booked as I suspected, why they did not feel comfortable telling me that is a mystery perhaps him and his colleague earlier were both not telling the truth. He attempted to explain that our room was not ready and then proceeded to inform me that hotels around the world have check in at 2pm and onwards and no hotel would let you check in earlier. Clearly shocked at the way I was being spoken to he continually informed me about how all the \u2018top hotels\u2019 in HK as well as the rest of the world had the same check in policy. I think he clearly misunderstood what the issue was and when I suggested to him that we were not impressed with his tone or what he was saying he preceded to laugh. He informed me again that all the top hotels have the same check in policy and they wouldn\u2019t allow a guest to pay a full nights rate for four hours stay, as this would be seen as ripping off guests. I\u2019m not sure if this employee had worked at top hotels however he continually tried to educate me on how 5 star hotels operated. Of limited capacity and lacking the basic understanding of what was being said to him he continued to repeat the same thing again and again. Having the privilege of staying at some excellent 5 star hotels as well as some of the best restaurants in the world I have never been spoken to like that before. Arrogant beyond justification and completely incompetent at explaining why there was such an issue when we checked in he jokingly apologized to which left me incensed. I could understand the complete rudeness of the first employee but this chap did an excellent job at illustrating ignorance. I am still baffled as to how this hotel could get so many positive reviews and yet treat us in this pathetic manner. To say this experience ruined our stay would be an understatement. I think these two employees need to be addressed as they have clearly limited capacity in listening or being attentive to us as their guests. I would not return to the Hotel Icon even if I were offered a free flight and free stay. This experience as well as the overall impression of the hotel leaves no doubt that this hotel is not 5 star. The lobby is impressive and the harbor view room is small. All the reviews of the showers are correct and the smell of the water, which is left after showering, is clearly an issue. As some of the reviews suggest that this is a college hotel perhaps they can teach their staff not to be so inept at understanding a simple request. We were not approached by any management or even offered an apology from the shocking service we received. Our stay at the Hotel Icon reinforced the fact that clearly some service sector employees are of limited intelligence and not able to grasp simple instructions. However it must be noted that the chap at the swimming pool and another whose name I did not know greeted us warmly every time we passed him. The location isn\u2019t great however was fine for the purpose of our stay.

The mirror was heated so it didn't fog up and it had a magnifying mirror as well.

Fortunately they made the room up around 4.00pm. On the first night we went to the Above and Beyond restaurant, the food was good Chinese. We had two soups, one prawn dish and a beer and a wine, the total cost $700 HKD, around $90 AUD. even by Australian standards it is expensive. We checked out The Market and the buffet looked amazing, heaps of seafood and every possible type of meat and the desserts were spectacular. It cost around $60 AUD and if we had an appetite to do it justice I would have went. Our package didn't include breakfast so rather than go the hotel buffet breakfast acros the road is a chinese restaurant, Tai Hing which serves a great chinese/western breakfast for around $28 HKD around $4 AUD. You get a bowl of noodles with cabbage plus scrambled eggs, ham, toast and a coffee, amazing! Also up Moby road is Delifrance and they also have a good breakfast for around $4 AUD.

We chose this hotel based on all the rave reviews it got on tripadviser. Maybe my expectations were to high because of all the hype, but I didn't find anything about the hotel as outstanding as I was expecting based on all the reviews. Don't get me wrong, it's a good hotel, but for me it lacked that extra special something that makes a good hotel into a great hotel you'd want to go back to. With all the fantastic hotels in Hong Kong, I'm actually suprised that this one has such a high rating. For me, the best thing about the hotel was the harbour view from our room. It's deffinetly worth paying extra for the view. Another thing I enjoyed about our room was the rain shower - probably the best shower I've ever used. Other than that the room is pretty much what you'd expect from a modern hotel, but nothing too special, \"design\" hotel rooms are usually much more interesting. At the Icon, it looks like much more effort was put into designing the lobby and other public spaces than into designing the rooms. Nothing wrong with it, just not the type of room that you'll remember for long or one that you would want to take photos of. Our rate didn't include breakfast and we didn't have any meals at the hotel. I did want to order room service on our first night, but the menu turned out to be limited and pretty boring, so we went out instead. The lobby bar seemed to be popular and crowded most of the time, so it must be good. The location is pretty good. They offer a free shuttle service, but we didn't use it and walked everywhere. The area has many dining and shopping options, so you don't even have to venture out too far if you don't want to. Staff is efficient, but nothing you wouldn't expect from a hotel of this class. Overall, if you get a good rate for the harbour view rooms, hotel Icon is a solid option for staying in Hong Kong. However, I wouldn't stay there again.

After all, it is ranked the second favourite hotel of travelers to Hong Kong on the site. I certainly wasn't disappointed. From the convenience of the airport express shuttle sending you the hotel directly, to the ultra modern lobby with a welcoming fragrance (unlike the musty smells of some hotel lobbies), to the excellent staff who checked me in, to the excellent modern room that ensured a peaceful and comfortable stay (there was even a TV in from of the bath tub!!!!), to the excellent housekeeper who ensured the room was tip top my whole stay and always had a smile, to the concierge who took pains to help me write my destination addresses in Chinese since I don't speak Cantonese and would need that in case the taxi drivers did not speak English or Mandarin, to the friendly staff who were ever helpful throughout my 5 day stay. The free wifi, soft drinks and chocs were a bonus! I have to say that all that was said about the hotel is true. Yes, location wise it may not be most central and it is a 10 min walk to the MTR, but this is a small inconvenience. The swimming pool was a bit of a let down as well as it is rather small and when other guests were smoking there, it is not the nicest place to relax. But these are really more than made up for by the excellent service and the great room. I certainly know where to stay when I am in Hong Kong from now onwards. What summed up the hotel experience for me was the check out experience. As I walked out of the lift, I was greeted by staff who took care of my bag. The checkout itself took 2 mins and I was asked to sit in the lobby and the staff would get me when the airport express shuttle came. Once the shuttle came, they loaded the shuttle and I simply boarded the bus. The shuttle then went to a few more 5 star hotels which cost a lot more. In each of the stops, the guests were waiting outside the hotel by themselves and struggled to load their luggage onto the shuttle. That summed by the difference in the service provided by the Icon staff.

We have thoroughly enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere, created by the design of the hotel and the staff. We stayed in a Club 65 suite, which was on the 26th floor and has spectacular views over the harbour. The suite itself has a very generous lounge, with desk and refreshment bar area. There is a whole range of office stationery and a wireless printer. Obviously the complimentary mini bar, which does include beer. Nespresso machine also there. The lounge area has a table and two chairs in the window (floor to ceiling/wall to wall) area, with a curved sofa in the middle of the room, which could easily seat four persons. Large TV and a Blueray system also in this area. The nice part is that there are two screens, which push into the wall and can be pulled closed to separate the lounge from bedroom. Off the lounge, there is a washroom. Normally in these types of rooms, I end up pushing the table and chairs out of the way as they clutter the room but no need in this room - plenty of room here. The bedroom also has a full size window overlooking HK island and Victoria Harbour, which is spectacular by day but more so at night. Big winged chair and footstool in the window, huge bed (very comfortable) and a tv. The vanity area leads off the bedroom and from there the toilet is in one 'room' and the large bath, with shower wet area is in another 'room'. All these areas have frosted glass as walls, which does offer sufficient privacy if that is required. All of the lights are electronic, with keypads all over. Nice to come back to the room at night, as the Lights go on automatically to the 'relaxed' mode. Bose IPod sound sytem in bedroom. Rooms and hotel are very clean. Definately recommend spending the extra cash for a club room. We used the lounge daily for breakfast, which is a nice way to start the day. Afternoon tea is also nice, with little sweet and savoury nibbles. Cocktails and canapes are worth it also. All premium branded drinks included, as well as champagne. It is a very relaxed, adult space so I am glad the hotel maintains the policy of no children allowed as this would ruin the atmosphere. There are windows behind and either side of the lounge, which overlooks HK island and the light show at 8pm. We ate in the Above and Beyond restaurant a couple of times, which was fabulous. I have no idea how anybody could complain. Pool area generally quiet as most people are here on business. Water is a nice temperature, bit cool when you fist go in but very refreshing. Ate lunch here a couple of times. Good choice and good quality. Never used the gym but it looked well equipped and quite snazzy. Also had breakfast in the Market, which again had a massive choice. The overall feel of the hotel is clean, comfortable and relaxed. When you arrive, do not expect white gloved bellboys - they are dressed in cargo pants, desert boots and sweaters, which I liked and I think sets the tone of the hotel. All other staff are more smartly dressed. The hotel is a nine minute walk from exit P2 of the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR, which really is not far at all. There is plenty going on around the hotel for eateries, shops etc. The hotel has a free shuttle bus, which takes you to both the Peninsula Hotel shops or Harbour City, a mammoth shopping centre, which is also where the Star Ferry leaves for HK island. The staf are very friendly and attentive and are keen to meet your requests. The only minor niggle we had was the sometimes the bellboys are a bit slow in opening the doors, especially for people entering the hotel. It really is not a huge issue but you kind of expect it. On arrival, you are given a queationnaire for your preferences for a variety of things like room service times, air temperature, pillow quality and any other requests, which they do comply with. A nice touch. All in all, a great hotel and would definately recommend it", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Stay in HK\u201d", "Author": "Goldens18", "ReviewID": "UR131035503", "Content": "My husband and I just got back from a wonderful four night stay at Hotel ICON.

The rooms were spacious, modern, and very clean, with the right mix of funky without being over-the-top. The bed was huge and very comfortable and the bathroom was big (for a hotel). We paid the little bit extra for a harbour view, which was pretty cool (I loved the neon lights of the city!). Also enjoyed the soft drinks and m&ms in the free mini bar, and the fruit platter which arrived in our room in the afternoon of our arrival was a very pleasant surprise. The staff were friendly and eager to please, especially the doormen who were quick to help you out of the taxi or shuttle and often carried our two-year old into the hotel to ensure he was safe. It is a fairly short distance to the trains - less than 10 minute easy walk (with a stroller), so coming from a country where we use public transport a lot this was perfectly fine for us. There is also a regular hotel shuttle bus to take you to the trains and the harbour too if you don't want to walk. We liked the location as the different activities we were doing were scattered all over Hong Kong so this was pretty central to everywhere. We had the buffet breakfast at The Market on the morning we went to Disneyland, which was very good quality and excellent range, and a standard price for a hotel breakfast (not cheap) but we ate well so didn't need much else to eat for the rest of the day. We didn't opt for the \"Club\" level room as have a two-year old so too young for the Above and Beyond lounge, and were often out sight-seeing until the evening so wouldn't be able to make the use of the afternoon tea and cocktails at night or relax over breakfast every morning. When departing we used the free Airport shuttle to take us to Kowloon Station and did the in-town check-in for our flight and got the express train to the airport. This was brilliant - the shuttle came promptly and just a couple of quick stops and we were at the train station, no queues to check-in for our flight (a massive plus when you have a two year old), cheaper than taxi, and probably quicker too as no traffic issues to worry about. I was amazed and wished that more cities had this system. Next time we'll use it to get us to the hotel as well. I find picking a hotel the hardest part of planning a holiday, and when I read the reviews and then booked I was really hoping it lived up to our expectations, which it definitely did.

I have stayed at most of the 5* HK hotels over the years, including many stays at he Peninsula, the Mandarin Oriental and both Island and Kowloon Shangri-La. This is my third stay int he last 6 months at the Icon and here re some reasons I love it: 1. The View - the Icon 38 rooms which I have stayed in each time have the most superb view over the harbour, makes me feel great to lay in bed and look out through the floor to ceiling picture windows. Many other hotels give you a side view or a view just from the desk etc and call it harbourview. 2. Nespresso -Yes I can order a good coffee in most 5 start hotels, but then I need to wait , get dressed, answer the door, or I can make myself a coffee usually from an instant pack, at this hotel you get a Nespresso machine with a selection of pods and you can enjoy a real cup of coffee within 2 minutes without having to entertain and room service staff. Bliss! 3. Mini Bar - However expensive a hotel is, however opulent, it irritates me to spend \u00a35.00 or $8.00 for a coke or an Orange juice, at the ICON the mini bar is complimentary, nicely stocked with soft drinks, nibbles and even a couple cans of beer. 4. WiFi- Great WiFI, no extra charge, allows you to connect multiple devices (Laptop, iPad, Android phone etc) 5. Bathroom - Great design, not opulent but comfortably functional and clean and modern 6. Location - Yes it s not 100% central and it is a few-minutes walk to an MTR but the payback is that you are staying in a relatively uncluttered area, no fighting through crowds as you leave the hotel, easy access to taxi's and it is literally only a few minutes away from bustling Tsim Sha Tsui main shopping / tourist area. 7. Service - Have not eaten in the hotel as I follow a special diet and eat in a local club that caters to my requirements. However the services I have requested (such as late check out etc) are always met with a yes or at least a good effort. So many other hotels automatically say no for each request and then come back with a compromise. 8. Office facilities - A great colour printer, scanner, copier is in the room, you need to email your documents to the printer and they print within a couple of minutes, no cables, no setting up a new printer, no installing software etc. just another way to make things easier for a business traveller. The only downside if any is that the hotel doesn't quite have the prestige of some of the other hotels in Hing Kong, and if you want to impress your business colleagues then this may not do it, but bottom line is that its a great hotel, comfortable, well equipped and well run by obliging people who want to make the guests happy.

I really liked the hotel. Good room with a great view. Everything is new. Great lobby bar, Restaurant at the top of the hotel is really cool. Also great pool and exercise facility. Depending on the purpose of your visit, the location can be good or bad. The good is that it is close to Hung Hom train station if you are coming from the Mainland or need to go to the Mainland by train. The bad is that the hotel is located in Tsim Sha Tsui East which is not well connected to Tsim Sha Tsui by MTR so you will need to take a taxi ($20-$25HKD) or wait for the hotel shuttle bus. If you need to go to the HK side then by taxi you are close to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel which is nice. If you would rather go to the HK side by MTR or the Star Ferry (much cheaper than a taxi) then you need to take a taxi or hotel shuttle to Tsim Sha Tsui which is really not that convenient. All in all if I need to stay on the Kowloon side I would chose this hotel again. However, on balance I would rather give up some of the advantages of this hotel and stay on the HK side which I find to be much more enjoyable.

We travelled a lot through out the years, and this is the best hotel that we have stayed in Hong Kong. We highly recommended everyone to stay at this hotel. Is a bit on the pricey side, but you get what you paid for. If we ever go back to Hong Kong, we will definitely stay here again no questions asked! The service is fabulous even if you don\u2019t book the above and beyond club rooms. We love the location which is really quiet, away from TST's major noisy streets. As we were checked into a higher floor, so the view was gorgeous. The room is really sleek & clean and has a nice designer feel to it. The size of the room is big enough for the two of us even with our 2 large and 1 medium sized luggage. We love everything in the room, especially the rain shower. The only a little concern would be with it's design, as the glass door is not wide enough to avoid water splashing everywhere on the floor. We also love the chairs and bed in the room, they were all so comfortable. When we first checked in, the staff were really nice, it was 5 am in the morning, 2 of the bell boys rushed out to help us with the luggage as the taxi pulled over. However, the staff at the front desk did not acknowledge or welcome us as honeymooners. As other hotels, they gave us free upgrades to suites, a free restaurant meal or bottle of champagne to make our stay special. We did not have any of that when we checked into our room. Sadly, a family of loud mainlanders was checked in next to the room next to us. The whole time the family sounded like they were going to kill each other and it was horrible. The next morning, we were thinking of bringing all these issues to the front desk attention and let them know our concerns. Before we even got to the front desk, we bumped into Raymond Hou from Guest Relations. Of course we voiced our concerns about our stay. He apologized to us right away and told us that the front door staff missed our honeymoon message on our account and offered us a bottle of house wine of our choice. As for the noise from next door, Raymond informed us that they are checking out as we speak. He promised us that front desk will only check in single business traveler next to us, so we can have the privacy that we deserve. We also requested to have bottles of water in our room instead of pop as their mini bar offers free pop & water. Raymond checked into our room daily to ensure housekeeping keep our bottles of water refilled. He also took his time and showed us how to get around town. By the time we get back to the hotel that night, the bottle of house white wine was chilled in the ice bucket along with a card signed by the whole Guest Relations Team. On one night, Raymond surprised us with yummy cupcakes from their restaurant \u201cGreen\u201d to celebrate our marriage. It was the yummiest cupcakes we ever had. He also took the time to show us the restaurant in the hotel and the lounge area. Raymond was really personal and really went \u201cAbove and Beyond\u201d to ensure that we were well taken care of, and most importantly made us feel very special. We tried the buffet restaurant \u201cThe market\u201d on one of the nights and it was amazing. They have every kind of cuisine there, you name it, they have it; such as: lobsters, crabs, sushi, sashimi, freshly shuck oysters, all kinds of cheese, fruits, lamb, steak, curry, rice, ribs, soup, dim sum etc. Their desserts are to die for, especially the green tea matcha mousse. My husband is not a big fan of dessert; but even he went for a few encores, it is that good! I can sit there all day long just to eat that dessert. LOL. We have also tried \"Green\" for dinner, it was absolutely amazing as well. We went there around 9:00pm, it was packed. The hostess notified us it will probably take 30 mins for the next table to become available. As she knows that we are guest staying at their hotel, she was being such a sweet heart told us that we could wait in our hotel room until they have a table. Within 20 mins, we got a call back from her and they already set the tables nicely for us. We had wings, spring roll, pasta & risotto. It was great, except the pasta was a bit overcooked and the risotto was undercooked. To sum it all up we did encounter a little problem in the beginning, but they took the initiative to fix the issues right away, unlike some other hotels we stayed in Hong Kong (Regal iClub we are looking at you). Hotel Icon took our concerns seriously, and made us feel all special again. We really wanted to thank Raymond and everyone at Hotel Icon for making our stay special. You all have really executed the word \u201cAbove and Beyond\u201d, and provided \"Legendary Service\".

We arrived to the very friendly and efficient staff who made our check-in very quick and easy. We had booked a Harbour View room and we were not disappointed. It was just a treat to wake in the mornings (curtains open all day and night) and see the busy harbour bustling with boats of all shapes and sizes and an even better site at night with all the sky scrapers showing off their colours, it was truly mesmerising. Our room had a wonderful comfy king size bed, bathroom had a fabulously deep bath with tv to view as you let you body soak after the endless shopping! the decor was modern and there was a Bose ipod/iphone docking station which was great if you wanted to listen to your own tunes, a large 3D flat screen tv which was positioned so you could watch from the comfort of your bed, while also taking in the harbour night vista. The Market Place, where you could go for breakfast, lunch and I believe dinner (although we didn't go for dinner) was just great, more then enough variety of food and the staff were there to assist if you required something that wasn't. On our last night we decided to dine in the Above and Beyond restaurant on the top floor, this experience was a little disappointing, although the food was great, there was just not enough of it. Our Aussie men were certainly not filled and we were also a little disappointed with the rushed service. We actually felt as though they may have been trying a little too hard and felt pushed through the meal, rather than being left to relax and enjoy the surroundings, the view was just amazing, we felt hurried and left feeling a little bewildered. But, all in all we had a wonderful time there, the gym and the pool were just fantastic and the gym staff were great! it was very pleasant to sit poolside and watch the hustle and bustle of the city folk below, while also being intrigued at how all those high rise buildings can accomodate so many people! Hong Kong was just an amazing experience all round and we will be back to stay at the Hotel Icon again! A must see and do would definitely be to go the Ladies Markets in Mon Kok, and take a trip to Victoria Peak on a public bus, what a buzz! there is also public transport to Stanley, where the well known Stanley Markets are and also a very popular beach for swimming.

The room was fabulous,waking up to the view over the harbour and HK Island made for a great start to each new exciting day in this fantastic city. Service was as excellent as can be expected from a five star hotel, with special kudos to the tireless doormen (or more accurately, doorboys) who made us feel glad to get back to the hotel each and every time with a jaunty smile and \"welcome back\". Our two stays were before and after a short trip to Macau and the hotel allowed us to store some of our luggage whilst we were away for these three days and promptly returned it to us upon checking in for our second stay. We were so glad to be back at the Icon, after the rather impersonal experience that was Macau. As an indication of the level of service we experienced, for our first stay we had arranged transport from the airport to Hotel Icon via the hotel concierge and we were stunned by the attention to detail and service delivered: the driver picked us up on time, was courteous and called ahead to the hotel a few minutes before our arrival. We were greeted at the Icon's front door by two bellmen who whisked away our luggage, and by a lovely front desk girl who led us straight to our room, bypassing the front desk, and proceeded with all check-in formalities in the room itself on her iPad. Efficient, professional, high-tech and smiling throughout. If only all hotel stays started this way! This experience did cause us to be slightly disappointed when we didn't have the same experience the second time around, when we went through the normal check-in procedures at the front desk, but only because we were so spoiled the first time around. Next year we're going back to Hong Kong and I'm very tempted to go for the Icon again; there's literally hundreds of good and excellent hotels in HK, but looking at my own experiences, the reviews here on Tripadvisor and the fact the Icon shot to the top 3 of HK hotels corroborate my opinion it'd be difficult to find a better hotel experience in Hong Kong than the Icon offers, unless you're willing to pay two to three times as much for the pleasure.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBeyond and above expectation!!!\u201d", "Author": "Adika J", "ReviewID": "UR128984968", "Content": "We were amazed by the staff hospitality when we first arrived at the hotel.

First impressions were that staff were passionate about their job and about being there. It really set a good atmosphere for anyone new to the hotel. We were escorted to our room, ICON 38 Harbour Room. The lady (I wish I could remember her name to give feedback), was very helpful offering to explain the areas on the map in regards to site seeing, transport, explaining how the taxi's services operated (red, blue, green taxi's). Every time we came down stairs hotel staff were always greeted by the staff and enquired as to how we where and took interested in our planned for the day. I could not fault any of the staff they were so accommodating, polite and friendly. All the meals breakfast, lunch, room service tasted amazing and they catered for as many variety of cultures through their foods available. Visually the hotel is modern in its decor but not cold or too harsh. It had a environmental vibe to it with floral and greenery arranged in a very unique presentation up the wall of the lobby. The room was spacious and we enjoyed the free mini bar snacks (which were replenished each day) (mm's, coke, juice, redbull ect..). Loved the fact the shower had the option of coming out of the shower head or out of the roof. Although what I didn't understand was why was there a TV above the bathtub? I couldn't get the sound to work properly on it. The Ipod docking station in the room was a good idea as we actually used it quite a few times. The location of the hotel was great, we could walk to most places on the side of the island (ladies markets, harbor shopping complex, ferry's, train station, shopping) or easily get a taxi. Our mornings regularly started off with breakfast followed by a walk to Starbucks. :) The most surprising part of our experience at the hotel was on the actual day of my birthday. They must of written my birthday date down from when they looked at my passport the day we checked in. This is because when my boyfriend and I returned from our day out on my birthday the Hotel staff had surprised me with birthday cake waiting in my room with a card signed by the hotel staff. Given that this was my first time away from home on my birthday it really meant a lot to me and I was overwhelmed by the lovely gesture.

The service levels were truly excellent, certainly the best I have every experienced, in every single area of the hotel and the facilities were top notch throughout.

Located in Kowloon in a quiet but easily accessible area. Getting there from the airport really could not have been easier - just took the airport express train to Kowloon station and took the K3 shuttle bus (included in train ticket price) which stopped at Hotel Icon - piece of cake! Staff were extremely professional and attentive and basically went out of their way to help you in whatever way possible. All staff spoke excellent english which is not that uncommon in Hong Kong but extremely helpful. We were travelling with our 7 month old daughter and they were very accomodating and helped us every single time we were coming or going with the myriad of baby equipment we were juggling. We had a harbour view room which was simply spectacular. The room itself was very cool and reasonably spacious (for China!) given we had a cot in one corner and still felt like we had space. Bathroom was quite large with bath and shower and nice toiletries. Mini-bar and wi-fi both complimentary - great added bonus. Hotel Icon is in between 2 MRT stations so easy to get around however taxis are pretty cheap (compared to Australia). LOTS of great local restuarants within a stones throw with excellent food. We particularly liked Lei Garden (basement level of the Houston centre, about 7 mins walk from hotel) and Jade Restaurant (it also went by another name.. something to do with a terrace) for lunch time dim sum which was off the large plazza/square about a 5 min walk from the hotel - inside a shopping complex type thing on level 2. Also, just across the road is a place called Yum Thai or something similar who did excellent take-away and had a pretty wide variety. Worth noting the hotel is located near the Hong Kong science museum and history musuem. The only two downsides was that the room rate did not include breakfast and food/drinks at the hotel were pretty pricey (nearly $25 for a beer and glass of wine in our room) but there are plenty of options for drinking and eating at your doorstep. Finally - the Kowloon vs Hong Kong Island debate. I will admit we only spent an afternoon on HK island and given we were only there for 4 days we clearly did not see all of Kowloon but when we go back, I would stay in Kowloon again. Firstly you get the added bonus of looking over at HK Island in the evening which is one impressive view but also, it just seemed cooler to me. HK Island felt a little like being in the CBD and while there certainly seemed to be some very cool pockets, I preferred the mainland.

Make sure you indulge in a steam before you leave and marvel at the high-tech changing room. My room was a city view (actually a view over the road) but quiet up on the 22nd floor. The free minibar (soft drinks and M&Ms) was a very welcome treat and room stationery, presented in a slick wooden box, highly coveted! I slept like a baby in the super-soft, 7foot wide bed and enjoyed the good selection of TV channels (English, Chinese, various languages - docus, movies and news. Not too many options, not too few) on one particularly lazy morning. There is plenty of storage room for your luggage and hanging space for evening clothes. The bathroom has a large curved door that slides back elegantly to open and close. Curved lines are used as an attractive theme in the basin, shower surround and mirrors with dark tiles adding indulgent mystique. The bath comes with a TV at the foot for ultimate spoiling. Although I booked a non-smoking room, it smelt faintly of cigarettes if the AC was switched off, a shame since I don't like to use AC where avoidable. Likewise, the bathroom could have done with a drain purge as I occasionally got a waft of unpleasantness. The restaurants were good and had tasty menus, but the bars were closed just after midnight each night, even for hotel residents; not ideal for those in town to celebrate weddings, for example. Equally, the bar at the 28th floor, Above & Beyond, is well-designed and comfortable, but there was a sense of exclusivity and not being wholly welcome on arrival. Not ideal when you are resident.

The design, service and room amenities were excellent.... the management and staff are really focusing on the small things, which for regular travellers make the real difference. We only ate in top floor restaurant both myself and my chinese friend were very impressed by the food and an excellent wine list.....the breakfast served in the morning was also far more comprehensive than I expected. In terms of the gym, very clean, very modern, excellent machines and plenty of cardio equipment...high ceiling and all looking out on to the swimming pool, sun-deck and views across to Hong Kong island...

The staff are largely students at the University, but don't let stop you, what they lack in experience they make up for in enthusiasm and service (probably the best I have had in Asia..and I have spent 60 nights in asian Hotels in the last year) We stayed for 7 nights in the ICON 36 Harbour View Room (2 adults and one baby) and it was a very comfortable room, and a standard size for Hong Kong rooms in this price range. A very spacious cot was provided. The very modern bathroom had a deep bath and a separate shower that included a rain shower head. The Pool and the gym were beautiful and also ultra modern. There is a day-spa and a \"Chill-out room\" that can be used if you check out of your room and need to wait for a flight. Location wise, it is only a short walk to the train station and a 15 min walk to the Ferry Terminal, though there is a complimentary shuttle bus that runs every 20 minutes to Harbour City Shopping Centre and the Ferry area. Wireless is included in the cost of the room and is readily available throughout the hotel and the shuttle bus! We ate at both the \"Market\" and the \"Green\" restaurants and they were both fantastic. The buffet at the Market was especially good, even for those (like myself) usually turned off by buffets (particularly hotel ones). The view from the bar on the roof (Above and Beyond)is excellent The hotel was very kid friendly, with a playground and basketball courts next door, plenty of high chairs, baby cutlery, complimentary toys etc. But for the the business traveller, don't let this sway you against the hotel, the walls are thick and the families are largely grouped on the same floors (at least it appeared they were), so I believe it is suitable for all class of traveller.

We chose to have the buffet breakfast which was considered the best we'd ever had and dinned in the top floor chinese restaurant which had a great view, relaxed atmosphere and delicious food. The other pleasant surprise was the reasonable priced, prompt and beautiful room service. We found ourselves looking for reasons to stay in so we could get room service! We loved the warm pool on the 9th floor with great views. Ideally it would be open a little later then 9.30 though. The gym and change rooms (including sauna for men and steam room for women) where modern and never crowded. Once we got our bearings transport was a breeze. We mainly used the MTR but also took advantage of the frequently running free shuttle service the hotel offers and the staff we're always helpful. My only suggest would be the shuttle stopped at more locations. We used two taxis while in Hong Kong.

The facilities are great, and you can enjoy some astounding harbor views while you swim or workout.

We booked and paid for a harbour view room. After booking and paying we found a cheaper price on the Qantas web site for a room on the exec floor which includes breakfast, free drinks, club lounge access etc. When we checked in we complained about the bad business practice of taking our money and then lowering the price, asked if we could be upgraded to a club room, which in essence we had paid for, to be told that hotel was full. We were told our original room was on floor 18 but was not ready! This was at 4.30pm!! We then were given a room on 16th floor. The room was the worst we've had in our recent extensive travels. A manager rang us and we told him we felt ripped off by the hotels dubious marketing, that the wardrobe was too small to put all our clothes in and we were deeply disappointed in the hotel. We were given a mobile clothes rack (making the small, depressing room more like a Chinese laundry), a nespresso machine and a few grandiose gestures that if a better room became available we would be upgraded. Our 5 day stay resulted in no upgrade, of course. The staff are all very nice and welcoming but we have found that the Chinese people in general are really very nice. This is still a lousy hotel. The room service menu is boring and lacks real choice. Whoever designed the bathroom should be made to mop it up after every shower and sentenced to a week trying to shave or put on makeup in the dingy, twilight lit bathroom.

The restaurants all stimulate your senses with their tasteful food choices and eye pleasing atmospheres. Breakfast at the Market is a fun experience (but be sure to book ahead for dinner) and the club (a happy hour hangout) on the top floor adjacent to the Above and Beyond Chinese restaurant has a really nice vibe to it with great views and cool mid century furniture. The lobby bar/restaurant is another well designed environment with lots of glass and a unique wall garden installation (a must see) and their weekend tea service and homemade cupcakes appear to be generating a major attraction for the locals. The only flaw with being in or around the lobby is that the hotel is not designed for those rare \"cold\" evenings in HK when the temperature heads south. I would suggest that the hotel reconfigures the front doors to help limit the impact of the NW wind on those cool February days. The staff (many of them students of the school that built and manages the hotel) are world class and need to be congratulated for their level of professional excellence.

We spent quite a bit of time after 6 pm drinking French champagne :) The buffet breakfast at the \"Market\" was really exceptional. Our only hesitation in booking this hotel was its location, as it is a little way from the heart of Kowloon , but we found that this was not a problem as it is less than a 10 minute walk to Tsim ShaTsui station and Nathan road. The real bonus is that it is situated next to a series of shopping complexes that are surrounded by open plazas with many restaurants and bars, all without the hustle and bustle of Kowloon Central.

Staff are very perceptive and the hotel's care for late-departing guests is second to none. That, for us, left a great impression. Recommendation: Friday night dinner in The Market restaurant where the head chef turns a 40 kilo whole tuna into sashimi right before our eyes. Excellent! The whole buffet can be recommended.

I read the rave reviews on ICON, saw good rates vs other 5-star properties in HK, and decided to give them a go. I'm very happy I did! + great customer service. Felt really well looked after, check in was really smooth + lounge/bar on the top floor was comfortable and drinks were good :-) + the room, I took the standard one, was already huge for HK standards. Bathroom with walk-in shower was really good! + 'rooftop' pool on the 9th floor - so not completely the roof, but the pool was clean and heated and did give a lovely view of the skyline + free wifi that worked well + breakfast buffet selection was good and of good quality but expensive (I only sat there once) - it's about 10-15 min. walk from central Tsim Sha Tsui, so not the most central hotel. The hotel mentions that Hung Hom MTR station is closest, however this station does not offer the best connections. You're better off making the longer walk to TST MTR for connections with other parts of Kowloon and HK Island. - the gentleman at checkout got pretty worried when I casually asked about travel times to the airport via different options, as I aimed to be there 1,45hrs before my short flight. Luckily I know HK very well so I was very relaxed, but I guess it would've freaked me out if I didn't know better. My advice: stay calm :-) - I always mention this regardless of the hotel, but I do think asking the equivalent of \u20ac20+ for breakfast is a big minus. I'll state the reasons again: 1. you pay enough as it is for a room in such a hotel to expect a better priced morning service, 2. it's wasteful - because many people choose to eat at other places instead, a lot of food gets chucked away and I'm sure there aren't too many hotels who donate their unwanted food to the homeless just yet, 3. if it were say up to \u20ac12 a day for such a breakfast, I and many people I know would much quicker decide to have breakfast at the hotel, meaning a larger profit for the hotel...right?

We didn't try the restaurants but had cocktails and coffees at the lounge bar which was fine. Sadly the bar at the top was off limits unless you were in an executive room which was a bit mean. Finally a word for the concierge staff who you think, because of their age, are not going to be great, they are in fact fantastic. Also the door staff who race to the doors to open them before you get near. Its nice and informal and it felt like coming home when we got back to the hotel after the bustle of Hong Kong.

We ate at the chinese restaurant on the 28th floor and this was by far our best meal at the hotel. On the 2nd floor is the \"Market Buffet\", it was okay if you only eat at it a couple of times but after day 2 there was not alot of changes made to the offerings. The hotel failed to inform us that we would need to make reservations in advance due to the new year for any of the dining options at the hotel. We were told a couple of times that if we wanted to eat at the buffet we would have to eat outside. That was annoying being guest of the hotel, staying in the nicest room and no warning had been given prior to arrival.

Location: Location was ideal. There is a free shuttle bus that takes guests to Harbor City, Middle Road and back to the hotel. You can get off at Harbor City for the Star Ferry or Middle Road for the MTR. The shuttle bus leaves every 20 minutes and is always on time. Right across the road from Hotel Icon is a small shopping area with a 7/11 and lots of local eateries and western style restaurants, 2 pharmacies and money exchangers. Nathan Road is about 10 minutes walk. Service: The service at Hotel Icon was amazing and extremely professional and everyone spoke perfect English. There is an Above and Beyond check in counter for guests staying in club rooms. Nothing was too much for the staff, they helped us make bookings for restaurants and showed us how to get to certain places and were always very friendly and helpful. There was also always a staff member available to ask for directions or simply to open the door for you. We have stayed in several 5 star hotels around the world and found the quality of service at Hotel Icon to be outstanding. Rooms: Our room was very spacious with a beautiful view of Victoria Harbor. The finishes in the room are all high quality with many clever design details such as a hidden multimedia panel which has universal chargers and USB ports. The bathroom is also spacious and well designed, with a curved sliding door to maximize space, a light up circular mirror and a bathtub with an LED screen TV. The shower however may be a bit small for some people. Food: Our package came with free continental breakfast daily at the Market Restaurant. There was a huge variety of food on offer with the usual selections plus a few surprises such as a chef to make rice flour rolls on demand and a huge range of fresh juices and fruit. Guests staying in a club room can also have breakfast in the Above and Beyond instead of at Market restaurant but the options are very limited. Comments: I cannot recommend this hotel enough. It is clear that a lot of though has been given into every design detail and the entire hotel just radiates understated class and elegance, including inside the lifts. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and the location is ideal to explore what HK has to offer. The only other hotel in HK along the same wavelength is the W but that hotel does not have a view of Victoria harbor. Hotel Icon is truly a haven from the bustling chaos that is the streets of Hong Kong. Cons: The finger food at the Above and Beyond Lounge during happy hour was rather limited and the cocktail menu could be improved with the addition of a signature cocktail.

I am 100% glad I am staying at the Icon!! It smells delicious every time you enter the lobby, the staff are wonderful, the service is fantastic, the rooms are spacious for HK & very modern. I am staying in the Icon 36 Harbour View room. What an amazing view! It is Chinese New Year at the moment & I am looking forward to watching the fireworks from the comfort of my room & at the rooftop pool BBQ. Some slightly negative points: It is not that close to the MTR, however it really is only a 5-10 minute walk & completely safe to do so late at night on your own (I am a solo female traveller & don't feel nervous in HK at all). Its also only HKD$20 in a taxi from the MTR so its not that big a problem. Also the hotel offers a free shuttle to Harbour City every 20 mins which is fab! There is not a lot of attractions (i.e shopping) directly around the hotel so take advantage of the shuttle. The only other negative is don't order toast for room service as it will arrive cold & hard! Not a major complaint really! All the positives: Rooms are modern, clean, good sized. I recommend the Harbour View rooms. Free wi-fi & mini bar (although the mini bar is only free soft drink, water & small sized m & m's so don't get too excited by that). The Market is lovely for breakfast & good value for money. The Angsana spa treatments are reasonably priced for a hotel spa & I will be trying a massage this week. For e.g a 1 hr facial & 1 hr body massage is HKD$1300. not too bad for a 2 hr treatment! The rooftop pool is very nice. Overall I highly recommend this hotel if staying on this side of HK. Compared to the other hotels nearby, this is by far the most modern, and seems more boutique than a big major hotel like the Shangri-La.

New, modern, absolutely beautiful. From the large, open and modern atrium/lobby to the vertical garden to the sweeping staircase. All beautiful\u2026 And that's where it ends. I checked in at 12:30am and there was only 1 person at the front desk helping guests. There were 2 other parties in front of me so it took about 20 minutes before I was helped. I booked a more expensive Icon 38 Harbour View room and even though the room was stunning it did not have a nice view of the harbour we all know (if you put your face against the window you can barely see the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, nothing to the right of the Convention and Exhibition Centre). The problem is that the Icon 38 Harbour View rooms are on the side of the building between the regular rooms and the harbour view rooms. The regular harbour view rooms should have a full/direct view of the nice part of the harbor (Bank of China building, IFC). It was too late and I was too tired to complain so I left it as is. As I mentioned my room was beautiful. The Icon 38 Harbour View rooms have a nicer setup than the Icon 36 rooms. The bed directly faces floor to ceiling glass windows which looks out at the harbour. Behind the bed is an open and very spacious bathroom. The bathroom contains a soaking tub as well as a very large rain shower. The next morning I had a buffet at the Market (a restaurant in the hotel) which was extensive and very nice although a little pricey for what you get (almost Las Vegas pricey but with a lot less food/variety). The restaurant looks great however. After breakfast I wanted to buy a specific SIM card so I asked the concierge about the nearest location of the SIM card operator. He told me to just go to a 711 and buy a SIM card there. I asked him again and he refused to point me to the location instead directing me to a 711 store which he said was just outside and to the right of the hotel. Of course the 711 was not really right outside of the hotel and when I finally found the 711 they had a more expensive SIM card. Check out at noon was a complete opposite of check in, very quick and smooth. The hotel rates have also skyrocketed since I stayed at the Icon and as a result are not a bargain anymore.

It has all the expected amenities and then some \u2013 free wireless Internet and mini-bar. The mini-bar is modest: mineral water, soft drinks, and assorted snacks. The room design is thoughtful, from a desk flip-up panel that has all the plugs, a cordless phone that can be used throughout the hotel property, to a toilet seat that won\u2019t slam, HDTV with beautiful pictures, and light switches that make sense. Dining I have tried two restaurants in this hotel: the 28th floor \u201cAbove and Beyond\u201d and 2nd floor \u201cMarket\u201d. The view from \u201cAbove and Beyond\u201d is fantastic. If you happen to have dinner around 8 p.m., you will have a front row seat to the laser light show. Food is exquisite, and service is superlative for both. Exercise The hotel has a well-equipped gym and pool overlooking the Victoria Harbor. The view is absolutely stunning. Bring your exercise or swimming gear! Otherwise, just bring your favorite drink, sit by the pool, and enjoy the view! Neighborhood The hotel is about 10 minutes from the nearest MTR station and about 20-25 minutes from the Star Ferry. The hotel has a shuttle service to the Star Ferry every 20 minutes. It is next to the busy and vibrant Tsim Sha Tsu area, with lots of restaurants, small parks, and shops nearby.

I believe the hotel employees are students of a university hotel management course where part of their studies is actual hands on performing the day to day routine operations.

Bathroom is nice, but the poor shower design means water on the floor. The need to think of a better idea. One day, we went out for the day and inadvertently left the do not disturb displayed. Upon arrival in the evening, the hotel sent two persons to clean the room for us when we return. Thumbs up! We had a nice view of the harbor from our room. Make sure to check out the harbor light show every evening at 2000/8PM. I understand that the show is coordinated with a musical selection on local radio stations, but the room had no clock radio to tune in to.

The views are outstanding and you have access to numerous advantages : breakfast included, access to Club level with drinks and such. To be honest, when we first entered the room my wife and I were underwhelmed. Modern and contemporary designs sometimes lack the feeling of \"comfort\", but it didn't take us long for the very clever design to win us over and provide great comfort as well. The bed faces the large window with the view of the harbour. Bathroom design is very clever with a tub and shower all in one enclosure, yet at the same time separate. All the amenities are there, including a FREE mini bar. The pool on the 5th floor is an infinity pool with unsurpassed views of the city and harbour. The gym also has the same and is very modern and with good equipment. Now on to the best feature of this hotel....the breakfast buffet at The Market. I have travelled the world and stayed at some very nice places, but NOWHERE have I seen a buffet like this. The title \"The Market\" sums it up. You have access to everything at this expansive buffet that has freshly prepared foods from various cuisines and all displayed beautifully. I can't say enough about this place.

More importantly, it wasn't a queen masquerading as a king. - The staff at the front desk were friendly and helpful. Cons: - Large rainforest showerhead + glass panel in shower that only extends two-thirds of the way across the shower entrance = very wet bathroom floor after every shower. - Not a fan of the Leonard Paris shampoo and shower gel provided. Actually, they might even be the same product put into different tubes, given their similar bluish hue and watery consistency. - The hotel is a bit of a walk from central TST and about 15/20 mins walk/stroll from the Star Ferry terminal. Still, if the weather is cool, it's a very pleasant walk and you can choose to go through either TST's streets or along the waterfront. - As one reviewer mentioned, security isn't great - no key card is required to access the room floors and there's only one 'bouncer' watching people going in and out of the lifts. Etc: - Have stayed at more than a few hip hotels and Hotel ICON is one of the rare ones with service as warm as the decor is cool. Corny but true!

The staff at Hotel Icon are very friendly and young. Whenever we pass by any one of them, they will politely greet us at any time of the day. When we reach our hotel room, we felt so happy and more than satisfied with our room. For our Icon38 room, we felt like we got so much more that what we had paid for! There's the minibar, a big Samsung Smart TV and another smaller tv in the bathroom, an expresso machine, Bose mp3 player for our iphone, a printer, stationery items (which proved to be very useful!) and a big comfy bed! The view from our 16th floor is magnificent. Icon 38 is a very spacious room in our opinion. The room smells new and is top notch clean. The bathroom is just perfect. I love every single bit of the room! I'd definitely stay there again when I come back to Hong Kong in the future. The only thing that we found a hassle was the location. As it was situated 15 minutes away from the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station, hotel guests have to take a hotel shuttle bus (frequency every 20 minutes) to the MTR station. However, service ends at 10pm everyday. We had to walk back to the hotel two nights out of three and it was very tiring!

It is also possible to walk to the East Tsim Sha Tsui station, where you can then take the Tsuen Wan Line on MTR -- very convenient!

The bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in, and the TVs in the bedroom and bathroom were impressive. I enjoyed all three of ICON's restaurants, but my favorite would have to be The Market. The Market offers a lunch buffet daily and spared no expense in the quality of its food. My favorite dishes were the wanton soup, Singapore chicken curry, pork neck, and snow-crab legs. Along with its amenities and facilities, ICON's service was also impeccable.

The room I stayed in was brilliant. It was a corner room with floor to ceiling windows windows with an almost 180 degree view of Victoria Harbour and Kowloon. The design of the room was very clever with a separate living are/office, bedroom and bathroom areas. The room was very modern with high quality finish. The shower & separate bath was very spacious and incorporated a waterproof LCD TV build into the wall in case you wanted to watch TV on one side of the bath whilst looking out over the city through the floor to ceiling windows on the other side. The living area was spacious and incorporated a clever curved office desk that made very good use of the space - the desk was spacious and very comfortable to work from and included a printer. The service from the staff was top notch. Generally the staff are quite young but they are very polite and it is very obvious they are very well trained and managed. Also noticeable was the healthy number of staff in the hotel - I could walk up to the concierge at any time and there was always a free staff member available to respond immediately. The breakfast on the 2nd floor was a great way to start the day. There is an abundance of good quality breakfast food. The one aspect they could improve upon is their cappuccinos by utilising a trained barista and not an automatic machine. Another nice feature of the hotel was the 9th floor \"day\" room. If you arrived before check-in or had a flight to catch after check-out, they had a secluded lounge area you could use to rest up, have a coffee, read a book or even have a shower. This is one hotel were it is definitely worth upgrading to the corporate floors. The upgrade entitled me to free in-room internet access, free mini-bar drinks, free breakfast, access to the 29th floor corporate bar area (free drinks between 6pm and 8pm and finger food), a small washing allowance (enough to wash 1 or 2 garments per day) and a later check-out. A nice feature of the internet access is it was not limited to one device. So I was able to connect both my laptop and my mobile phone to the internet via wireless under the one account. The manager of this hotel has to be commended for the very high standards they are achieving at Hotel Icon. This is a hotel that is achieving standards you would only expect from a hotel charging many times the room rate at Hotel Icon. The hotel is on the edge of the Kowloon shopping district and it is a pleasant 15 minute walk along the waterfront to the Star Ferry dock on the harbour. There is a train station 100m away though its not one of the main lines into central station so you would need to change trains to get to central. There is another subway station maybe 300m away with a line that runs directly to central station. There is a sedate shopping centre behind the hotel or you can go out the front door to join the shopping bustle of Kowloon.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Taipei, Taiwan", "Title": "\u201cForm over function\u201d", "Author": "SC42300", "ReviewID": "UR121812078", "Content": "I am currently staying at the Hotel Icon.

I am an expat living in Asia and come to Hong Kong every couple of years for fun and always stay at 5 star hotels. From the rave reviews I thought Hotel Icon would be on par with those other luxury hotels. After my first night, I have experienced a few \"firsts\" in a hotel, both good and bad, 1. First time I have showered in a hotel shower that did not drain. After 5 minutes I was standing in half an inch of water. I inquired about this and the maintenance staff promptly came and fixed this problem. 2. I am very sensitive to light when sleeping so always make sure to draw the curtains very tightly closed before bed. However, woke to the sun shining in my face because the curtains were not proper black-out curtains. Also, light shines in where the curtains meet the wall and directly into the eyes of whoever is sleeping by the window. 3. After falling asleep again with the duvet covering my face, was woken at 9am exactly by housekeeping. Pretty early for a Saturday morning I thought. 4, Due to the design of the shower, I lot of water splashes out, enough to form large puddles. We currently have towels covering the floor. 5.

We were on the 25th floor facing the harbor, and the view was as good as advertised. Enjoyed watching all the lights come on in the evenings, especially as many buildings had converted over to their holiday displays! The room itself was nice and big by market standards, with a king bed and lots of desk and storage space. If I had one complaint it was the bathroom - while it included all modern conveniences the layout was somewhat funky, and positioning of the shower could lead to some pretty big water spills if you weren't careful. Lighting in the bathroom was also a little dim, felt kind of like you were getting dressed in a cave. Insulation of the room was good, as I never heard other guests coming back to the room. We did take advantage of a lot of property amenities. Went up to the club lounge for complimentary cocktails all three nights we were there, which was relaxing after exploring the city all day. Also got a chance to use the pool, which overlooks the harbor and offers a great view at sunset. The pool was heated, but could get a little chilly at night as it was pretty windy that high up. I also used the fitness center one day and the equipment was in great condition. They had a couple machines I hadn't seen before and were fun to try. Ate at the lobby restaurant one night that we were there, prices were reasonable and the food was good. Service was a little slow, but the restaurant was very busy as it was raining out and most people didn't want to venture out. Breakfast was a good mix of American and local food - enjoyed the full buffet downstairs more than the smaller offering up on the club level. The rate we got was at least a couple hundred dollars cheaper than we would have paid for a club room at the Intercontinental or the Shangri-La, and given the newness of the facility and the great staff I think it was a great deal.

For the Club 36 Harbour room (other than a view of the harbour), your free mini bar is stocked with beer, there is television in front of the tub, and the room comes with a printer. Sweet! I also got a room on the 27th floor which made for fantastic views of the harbour. All rooms have rain showers and are stocked with Leonard Paris accoutrements. The hotel itself is very modern (my type of aesthetic), looks new, is new, smells new. Actually, it smells like Burberry perfume when you walk in through the front door. The pool on the 9th floor is gorgeous, and the adjacent gym has the most modern equipment (love the treadmills). There is also a sauna in the men's room (I'm going to venture to guess that there is one in the ladies' room too!). I don't understand at any reviewer who would take umbrage at the staff's poor language skills. He couldn't be more wrong.

There is always a taxi just steps outside of the door so no worries there. The restaurants in the hotel are STELLAR! My favorite is THE MARKET. Open for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.

The complimentary minibar is a great idea and all services we experienced were faultless. The location really was very good being still walking distance to Star Ferry, TST etc but the proximity to the train station made our lives much easier after winning the shopping Olympics at Shenzhen on a couple of occasions. Other things that really stood out : The pool area and indeed the view from the pool area is quite oustanding - the entire harbour and Island right there in full panorama. It became a popular place to regroup at the end of the day and watch the Lightshow with a cold drink, depsite the fact that our rooms also had great views. The Concierge and particularly Cody where outstanding - Cody did everything from chase us down the street to direct us to a better restaurant ( he rang ahead and discovered they were out of Goose which he knew we were after) to packing up our shopping and organising it to be shipped back to Australia. Nothing was too much trouble and his smiling face and happy demenour was very much appreciated. Also the 'Timeless' room was very welcome and we all used it when we checked out to repack, relax and show etc...as our flight was not until very late. In saying this is also the first hotel I can remember that allowed us to check in at 7.00 AM ( at not extra charge)- can you beleive it !

I decided to book this hotel after reading the excellent reviews on Tripadvisor. I've stayed in several other hotels nearby, and this one beats them all. It's an extremely professional atmosphere, but it's also reasonably relaxed. You get that legendary Asian level of real quality service, but without feeling fussed-over, as you do in other hotels. I'm staying in a Club Suite 60 (I think that's what it's called!). There's loads of room for one, but it would also be pretty spacious for two. Having a separate work space is great. There are two massive TV's, and the biggest bath and sink I have EVER seen. The shower/bath room is a wet room, with a fabulous shower built into the ceiling. From a business perspective, at last I have found a good hotel which provides free wi-fi. I have never understood why other hotels insist on charging for this. Here it's free, and you just connect as many devices as you like for nothing. Great! There's a fancy printer/scanner in the room which prints wirelessly, and there are nice touches like little wooden trays with 'helpful' stuff like a stapler, paperclips, sticky notes etc. That's a really nice touch. If you're in a suite, you really don't need the use of a business centre. There are nice places to sit in various parts of the hotel on the 1st and 2nd floors, and I satisfactorily held a couple of meetings there. There's a really lovely board room on the top floor which you can also use if you're staying in Club. The 'Above and Beyond' Lounge on the 28th floor is super. The views across Victoria Harbour to the Island are stunning, and I'll bet you'd struggle to get a better one without paying huge amounts of extra cash at the waterside. Nick manages it, and he's brilliant. The quality of the food in the hotel is excellent - I thoroughly recommend the 'Eggs Royale' at breakfast - blimey! Of course, food is dear by HKG street standards, but it's certainly not dear for what you get by 5-star hotel standards. There's a nice, relaxed happy hour going on, officially from 6:00-8:00, but I went in at 5:30 and got a free glass of champagne. The hotel is a brisk 6 or 7 minute walk from the nearest MTR. But taxis are pretty cheap, and I've been journeying to Central by taking a taxi from the hotel to the Star Ferry at TST ($20 - about \u00a31.70) and then bobbing across the harbour on the ferry. There is a shuttle bus which goes to the MTR, but I never seemed to have the time available to wait for that. So, would I come back here? Definitely. It offers me everything I need, and I'd much rather have the extra space of a suite here on this side than pay a lot more for a shoebox at the Mandarin.

Hotel Icon is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. HK being the Asian hub that it is, has many nice hotels but (and this is a big BUT) HK customer service in general is not known to be the friendliest. I have stayed in many hotels where the service has been efficient but very curt. Not in Hotel Icon. The staff is so wonderful and nice! And have I mentioned that the place is so chic and modern? My husband and I were given a room upgrade and the club room was just gorgeous with a great view of the harbor. My husband couldn't wrap his head around the \"everything in the bar is free\" concept and the in-room Nespresso machine just sent him to heaven. The room and bathroom was huge especially by HK standards. But this hotel earned my complete admiration when I fell ill with food poisoning (courtesy of another hotel's restaurant) and the night staff made a midnight run to the convenience store to pick up electrolyte rich drinks for me. The staff would even ask my husband how I was doing the days after. There is only 1 major drawback to staying at this hotel. If you are a shopaholic like me and love hotels that sit on top of major shopping malls so that you can bring up your bags and rest in between sprees, you will have a hard time staying at Hotel Icon which is quite far from Ocean Terminal, Nathan Road and all the other TST shopping areas. They have a free shuttle that leaves every hour which is great but you will have to either walk or take a taxi back to the hotel which is very difficult with a lot of shopping bags. But if you are in HK for business or other non-shopping reasons, then I cannot recommend this hotel enough!

Perhaps because of this lineage, Hotel ICON exudes a fresh, young, stylish vibe. The staff look young, are personable, and helpful. The hotel opened in mid-2011, and naturally, facilities are spanking new. Because the interior design (by Hong Kong native William Lim) adopted a contemporary, understated language, I think the property will hold its age well over time. The best part of the room is its spaciousness (my city-view room measured 36-square meters) and the floor-t0-ceiling windows. The next most welcome aspect is that everything in the mini-bar is complimentary, refreshed daily during morning housekeeping. There is a thoughtful trove of stationery, and even an in-room printer and a supply of paper. The secret delight is the generously-sized bathroom with glass-enclosed shower, deep soak tub (with a mirror that turns into a TV at the flick of a switch), huge mirrors, ambient lightning, and Leonard toiletries. It\u2019s amazing to have such a well-designed and spacious bathroom in Hong Kong where hotel rooms are notoriously small. The facility I personally utilized the most was the gym, which faced the pool and featured a good selection of TechnoGym equipment in a spacious, high-ceiling environment that allowed in lots of natural light during the day. Fitness buffs will not have much to complain here. The business center is on the 28th floor, but with free WiFi for hotel guests and in-room printers to boot, one would hardly need to make use of this facility. The final amenity to note is a room on the 9th floor (same level as the fitness center, pool, and spa) called Timeless. Featuring leather lean-back chairs and an array of beverages, fruits, and magazine, this is the sanctuary for guests who check-in before their room is ready or prefer to wait at the hotel before heading to the airport for their late flight. A word of caution: the chairs look more comfortable than they actually are once you settle into them.

At first glance I thought it would be beyond my price range, but after checking the dates and rates, it wasn't that bad. It might be out of some peoples price range, but I think for what you get in the hotel it is well worth it. Location: In Kowloon, near the HK Museum and Museum of Science. It is really only a 5-10 minute walk to East Tsim Sha Tsau mtr station and another 5-10 to TST station and Nathan Road. Around the hotel there are lots of restaurants, shops and cafes (the BBQ place across the road is pretty good and cheap lunch specials). Only a 10 minute walk to bars around Hanoi Road or Knutsford Terrace. I loved the free shuttle bus to Kowloon Station, as I go there for the cinema, shopping and to eat. It is actually a free airport shuttle bus, but we used it a few times. The hotel also has another shuttle bus to take you closer to the mtr... so walk or be lazy, but it really isnt that far from anything. Hotel: The design and decoration of this hotel I love. Quite modern and funky, but not loud or garish. The foyer and cafe on the ground floor is AMAZING. The whole back wall is alive with plants... a vertical garden (I wonder how they water it??)). Rooms: I have stayed here twice now... first time in the Icon Harbour View Room. What I wanted and what I love is you get a view of Hong Kong island and the harbour. People like staying on HK Island, but the best view is of HK island. The rooms are not huge, but not tiny either... which is very normal for HK. Bathroom is big, awesome shower and bath too. Beds are really comfortable and twin beds are quite big too. Free mini bar (no alcohol though), big LCD TV and great blinds/curtains which block out the sun when you sleep in. The second time I stayed was in the Club Harbour View Room. More expensive, but a few more amenities in the room (ipod dock and speakers, printer, nespresso machine and private check in ) and you get free access to the top floor cafe/bar. Free breakfast, free coffee/drinks all day, afternoon tea and the best bit... free cocktails and tapas in the evening. Service: Amazing. Very attentive, from the guys at the door, to reception, to the guys collecting your bags... they have staff in the foyer to ask if you need help, or taxi or anything when you come down to the foyer. More: The pool is awesome... the best views of HK island, even when you are in the pool swimming. Gets a bit hot up there though and not any plants or anything to help this out... but chairs and umbrellas. The gym is there too... looks pretty good. Inside there is a sauna and big change rooms with lockers. All in all...

My wife and I checked into the hotel on 2 June 2011 with an original plan to stay for two nights. Unfortunately, I was suffering from health issues and I immediately informed the management of the hotel that I would like to extend my stay to 21 June 2011 after checking in and the management agreed. During my stay, I had pointed out to the management the inadequacies of the hotel through emails. Mr Alvin Yim, the Front Office Manager and Ms Susana Frok, the Director of Rooms had admitted their knowledge about the problems but no improvement had been made. They tried to offer 3 nights complimentary stay to comfort me but it was rejected by me. I had changed rooms four times because of the sub-standard service rendered by the hotel. The problems that I had encountered included but not limited to the following: The hot water system was not working properly which made it not suitable for bathing. Because of this problem, I had to change the Room 2009 to Room 2011 at midnight despite I was indisposed. Whilst I was staying in Room 2011, the lights flashed continuously and I had to change rooms again back to Room 2009. I had complained again to the hotel on 18 June 2011 that the hotel breakfast service was not up to standard. My complaint had never been addressed and there was no improvement in the breakfast service. At about 8:15pm on 18 June 2011, my wife went back to the room to get the medicine for me but found that the key card had been de-activated. At the same time, Mr Alvin Yim of the hotel asked me to go to the conference room on 28th floor and told me to check out immediately. I requested to stay for one more night and leave the next day because I had an important meeting at 8:30pm and I was not feeling well. Mr Yim refused discourteously alleging that I was behaving inappropriately during the stay. The allegation made by the hotel was totally untrue and defamatory in nature.

But as with any new hotel--the Icon has it's share of birthing pains that make it not quite there yet, in as far as hotel excellence is concerned. Arrival via Airport Express bus was smooth, a doorman ready to swing open the rather narrow door. As I had booked a club room, I was directed to the special reception on the 28th floor. I will have to note that the greeting at the main floor was cursory at best, unwelcoming and uninspired if I were to be truly honest. I wish I could say reception on the club floor improved, but that wasn't really much the case. As I was shown to my room, I turned on the television and here came the first major snafu. The technology on their televisions is so new, no one could remove an irksome, running blurb from the manufacturers on the screen--an hour later, two visits from engineering and housekeeping--and I finally had to ask for a change of rooms. The rooms are spacious by HK standards--clean, modern lines, new furniture, excellent linens. The toiletries are not the finest, but they were sufficient. And the design, especially of the bathroom, was interesting and esoteric, if not very inspired. A curving door closed it in, and an eye-shaped shower stall with rainshowers completed the modish style. The bath tub was smaller in design and yes, there was the charming television adjacent to it. The club floor was small and given the high volume of guests during my stay--was not in the least bit inviting. It was crowded, busy and not very well manned. I would think it would be more enticing if there were less people as all tables, whether lounges or bar stools, were always full. The same can be said about the pool--great view, excellent design but really quite small and congested with people. I think the staff has yet to learn when loungers have been vacated--and in fear of removing someone's reservation--most loungers linger all day with strewn towels but nary a guest. I tried venturing a swim at 630 am, but even then, two other swimmers had the same idea and we all had to share our laps with in arm's reach. The gym is fairly complete and is in a sun-dappled room facing the enticing harbor. An excellent hotel gym by all regards. The shuttle to shopping areas is a great idea--unfortunately it can only make drop-offs and isn't prepared for pick-ups. A shame, considering it can take considerable time and sweating in HK humidity to walk back from, say, Ocean City. Breakfast was varied, interesting and good value. All the western staples with some Asian offerings, including Singaporean and Indian. Service here was at it's best. The most unfortunate thing about this hotel perhaps is the fact that rooms were not entirely soundproof. My next door neighbors were a group of teenagers and enjoyed themselves immensely playing loud music and screeching to their heart's content. Would I return? HK always has interesting choices on the page as far as hotels are concerned. The design element here, sorely the primary pull of the hotel, felt charmless and un-involving. The staff are either too young or too busy to do their jobs right.

The only down side, if there is one is that our room was directly below the wooden floors of the 28th level lounge so even a simple movement of a chair could be heard from about 6am when breakfast started. This could easily be fixed if the hotel attached felt or small isolation buttons to the bottom of the chair legs....problem solved!

The only doubt was that its location is rather far from Nathan Road and central Tsim Sha Tsui. Though the hotel has its shuttle bus running almost every 30 min to central TST. And also I must say that Nathan Road is easily accessed by foot within 15-20 min walk. Taxis in HK are quite cheap and there are plenty of them around the hotel. As almost everyone says here, this hotel is ULTRA modern with almost all amenities the guest may require. We stayed in CLUB room on 23rd floor with Harbour view. Club room is the same size as the ordinary one, but has some privileges: evening cocktails at Above & Beyond lounge, free minibar (though with rather small choice), Nespresso coffee-machine inside the room. Also I should say that Club Rooms are from 23rd to 27th floor, while ordinary ones (\"Icon rooms\") are below 23rd floor. Rooms are not that big as I thought after reading reviews here, but of normal size for Hong Kong. Living space is not big, but bathroom is spacious, and there's even TV over bathtub if someone likes it. Evening cocktails were very good option, though the quality of cocktails differed from day to day. Breakfast on the 2nd floor was EXCELLENT with very big choice of meals. Breakfast on the 28th floor has less choices, but has the view on the harbour. :) Hotel staff is very attentive to guest's requests, and this is good. Visit the swimming pool at least once (open to ALL hotel guests). It is on the open terrace on the 9th floor and has fantastic views, especially at night! There are still some construction works within the hotel which may bother someone whos's living nearby. Also I should mention that you may wait for the lift (evevator) for a very long time, especially at breakfast time on the weekend.

Breakfast was included and was served on the top floor (menu and small buffet), so you can watch boats on the harbour while eating. A free afternoon tea was supplied there too, but I was too busy sightseeing to try it, and free cocktails and canapes were served from 6pm - 8pm which I definitely did get to try! Room service was quick and the food was really good, but I'd recommend just eating out in Hong Kong for great cheap tasty food. I was impressed that the night doorman didn't bat an eyelid when I stumbled through the doors at 4am, a bit the worse for wear. Everything is brand spanking new and very clean, and the pool is just big enough to do laps in - which I loved - but wished it was a little bit bigger. My one criticism was the staff could be a little bit overly attentive, but I would put that down to them being young and eager to please.

Breakfast is excellent as well as dinner at the restaurant on the 28th floor. Pool is good with a nice view. But there are some things that should be noticed: Contras: Hotel is pretty far away from the MTR station. It means for you that you have either to work or take a taxi. Working 15-20 minutes in Hong Kong summer time is everything else but pleasant. It is hot and humid, so after 5 minutes you fill like you have used the sauna. Taxi is also pretty a troublesome option, since hotel is new one and not every taxi driver knows how to find it. So if you choose a taxi you would better take a local map with a hotel on it, to show the driver the right location. Cleaning could be better. Actually they have not cleaned the floor at all. We have booked the club floor, so we have used the lounge. The quality of food is good, but choice is limited. If you have stayed at Langham Place the difference will be not in favor of Icon. Despite all this, the value that hotel offers for this money is great. I am pretty often in HK and have seen a lot of hotels. This is one of the few valuable.

I booked it after reading the great review on here, making use of the soft opening 'buy 2 nights get one free' offer to book myself a club 36 harbor view room. The hotel lived up to all the reviews and I would recommend it to anyone. It's the little touches that make the difference - the personal check-in on the club level was nice, but being shown the room amenities was great, especially when the member of staff showed me they had already provided me with an Australian adaptor, which came in very handy. The free mini-bar (soft drinks) was superb and always replenished every day, along with M&Ms and coffee pods. In fact, one evening I had a pack of M&Ms before going out and when I returned they had been restocked - this is because housekeeping had been back in to fill up my ice bucket for me. Like I said, it's the little touches that really do go above and beyond and that are remembered. The free breakfast allowed me to eat in either the club lounge or in the buffet restaurant on level 2. The first morning I used the club lounge and the service was excellent, but I had to choose from a limited hot food menu - I'm not an egg fan, so there wasn't much choice for me. There is a semi-buffet in the lounge for cold food as well. The next two mornings I used the buffet restaurant, which was also great. A good variety of food (western and Asian), both hot and cold and the staff were very attentive - I even got a 'welcome back' from one staff member on my 2nd day eating there. The club lounge provides cocktails between 6 & 8pm every night, though I didn't have time to make use of it so can't comment. It also provides afternoon tea and I had this on my last day (you can use the club lounge after checkout while waiting to go to the airport). Although there was no much provided, it was lovely and again staff were attentive in replenishing drinks (free soft drinks all the time in the lounge). Every time I walked through the lobby the staff would say hello, wish me a good day or night, etc. and they were a joy to chat to. I know a lot of the staff are students at the polytechnic, but they were more professional than the staff in some top class hotels I have visited. All in all, it's a fabulous hotel and I would recommend it to anyone.

Being a loyal customer of Langham Place, I was attracted to this hotel by the overwhelming good reviews and the special rate. Here is the pros and cons of the hotel. For location, centrally located but not over crowded. Room size is good... But I only have one piece of luggage and I am here by myself, it's comfortable... Lighting... the lighting is really good in this hotel, a big plus for business people if you can't sleep at night and want to work... For long stay visitors, 2 weeks and above, Langham is better as there is a kitchenett for the suites. If you are a light sleeper like myself, Icon has better sound proof system unless you stay near the service station, then you hear the service wagon, open and close door...Smell control is also very good. No smoking smell at all in the room or the hallway. Hotel staff are really friend and helpful. Unlike other hotels, most staff here are bilingual, both English and Chinese. I also like the fact that it's not carpet on the floor, only area rug around the bed... Bathroom is spacious... The Above and Beyond club lounge in Icon is part of the Chinese restaurant, it could be noisy during the day and night time. I really like the Club lounge at Langham Place, it has better food, drinks and facilities. There are always sweets, fresh fruit, orange juice, tea and coffe and house wine at the club Lounge, more private and exclusive... Re service, during the past few stays, I could not find any faults of Langham place. Icon is a brand new hotel, I was impressed when I got my long stay questionnaire after my booking, but nothing was implemented when I arrived at 11:30p.m. after 8 hours long flight. It was 12:15 a.m. by the time the apologetic housekeeper changed all the beddings as I was allergic to feather, gave me the extra hangers. Then the pillows were too high and I had to ask for the small pillows on my questionnaire at 3 am. It needs better oversight on housekeeping... The Chinese restaurant on the top floor is good, but need to increase the varieties of choices for both dim sum and main course. Selection is limited. However the quality of food is better as no MSG at all, which is a big plus for me as I am allergic to MSG as well. It's nice not to take antihestimine after a meal. Also, if you stay at the club floor, there is a HK100 daily credit for dryclean and laundry, which is perfect for me. Overall, the hotel is very thoughtful and does its best to make guests feel comfortable... Free internet, free local calls, free snacks and mini bars...

First things first; Check-in didn't set a good mood, apparently our web booking had only been made for one person and therefore we were 'surcharged' for having a 2nd person in the room. Whilst technically correct I must admit I didn't notice that online and when booking a double room my expectation is that it will accommodate 2 persons and we were not using the third days's breakfast as we were checking out the night before ..the value was looking a lit less. On reaching the room the air-conditioning vent had fallen from the ceiling, the promised welcome letter wasn't there and the bags took ages to arrive....nothing that couldn't be fixed but 'niggles' which detract from the customer experience. Harbour view rooms are good with great city views. Non-alcoholic bar items are free and there is good coffee in an Nespresso machine. Bathrooms are excellent as are the toileteries. The hotel location is a 15 minute walk from the MTR, and about 20 minutes from the Star Ferry - in humid Hong Kong this can be an issue though there are taxis and the Airport Express bus does connect to Kowloon station so options abound. Hotel facilites are good. The garden wall is impressive and gives a great ambience. Gym has great views, reasonably equipped and the pool is excellent. Though during our trip was not accessible as they seem very sensitive about 'lightning risk' when the weather is stormy and they close the pool. Breakfast on the top floor was included and is adequate, though some very simple mistakes again impact the experience e.g. one 4 slice toaster for a whole room?. Also on day 2 we were refused access as they were 'full' and re-directed to the main dining room on the 2nd floor. To be honest the breakfast food range there is better but this seemed to be a ploy to move people as the breakfast time neared an end (we arrived at the top floor at 9.45am when breakfast closed at 10am) The evening buffet was great value with fantastic food - it get's very busy so book and get there early. Bar staff in the lobby were great and service very good. In fact all the staff try very hard and are very welcoming which does make this hotel a pleasure.

The bathroom provided plenty of space, especially the shower, which had a rain shower feature. The mini bar is complimentary and refilled each day. Once we were settled, our doorbell rang. A bottle of wine was delivered and a card signed by the staff wishing us a Happy Anniversary. We were celebrating our 7th. We decided to make reservations for dinner. We went to the concierge desk and spoke to Cody, who made the reservation. When we arrived at the restaurant, our first round of drinks were paid by the Hotel. I though that was a very nice gesture. We frequented the concierge desk often for recommendations and travel plans. A young lady who was extremely helpful was Kit. She helped organize and plan our way around the city.

(long story, but ask anyone who has been the Avenue of the Stars prior to 2010, and they will be able to enlighten you), and from there on in, you are in the thick of Kowloon. Rooms are spacious, clean, well designed, clean, well equipped, clean, have comfortable beds and did I mention that they are clean? Stayed on the 25th floor with access to the \"Above and Beyond\" executive facilities. Ate breakfast there two days; you can order from a menu as well as eat from the buffet. On the second day the buffet became quite bare by 0940, and it didn't seem to be replenished until just before closing time at 1000 which seemed a bit odd. Breakfast downstairs was superb, both as regards to quality and choice. Didn't try the afternoon tea, but did try cocktail hour where there was an excellent choice. Which takes me to the classical music. There it was, ever present, slightly to dominating and loud, both at breakfast and in the evening. I actually found it a bit depressing, rather like being in Arkhangelsk on a cold, dark, rainy morning in November. I don't need or want cultural infusion at breakfast time - I need coffee. There seems to be noise everywhere in Hong Kong, so it would be interesting to know if other guests think it might be a good idea to cut out the enforced music at breakfast. Service is generally faultless. As I had a flight leaving at 0210, I paid for a late checkout at 6pm. this cost 50% of the usual room rate. The plan was to get some sleep during the afternoon, and take a shower before leaving. Despite the \"Do not disturb\" light being on, housekeeping rang (on the phone) at 4pm to say that they could not service my room because the do not disturb sign was on. Check the times: it was 4pm, and I was going to check out at 6pm, so i don't understand what they were going to achieve with a service at that time. Needless to say, I had been asleep for 10 minutes when they rang, and that was that. no more sleep. The shower didn't go too well either; there was no warm water, so my shower ended up being a wash in the sink. I hope a bit more experince will help them iron out these small problems, because they really do try hard and have really achieved a lot in the short space of time they have been open.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cMy new choice in Hong Kong\u201d", "Author": "Halesy07", "ReviewID": "UR115524130", "Content": "First time I have stayed here.

Hence, you have the privilege of being very near the place of action though not necessarily in the middle of it.

Just be sure to take the hotel card (with the map) with you to show the taxi drivers as they may still not be too familiar with this newly opened hotel. The hotel itself is very new with ultra-modern and tastefully-designed decor and facilities so it is everything you'd expect from a 21st century hotel...simple but elegant, minimalist yet very artistic...and oh so immaculately clean. The view from our room was breath-taking. We had a partly city and partly harbour view, so we could see the best of both worlds from our 25th floor room. The room was quite spacious compared to HK standards, with hygienic and comfortable beds and pillows. The bathroom was unique and a statement in itself...with curved, transparent glass shower rooms drenched by a huge rainshower and a separate deep soaking tub.

The hotel is in soft launch phase though the spa alone remains to be opened yet. The hotel rooms have a Nice harbour view (harbour view option), swimming pool with a pleasing view which I liked. The harbour view is quite good due to the hotel's location. The hotel lobby is not grand like other 4-5 star hotels. But unique. It has a wall hanging garden. i.e. Plants on the vertical wall. The plants are real. Stunning combination of plants. However on the 3rd day I notice the plants were dry & were drooping which took away the splendour. The bed and the pillows were too good. Nice combination. The chair I felt was an imitation of the famed egg chair. Must say that the free wi-fi is a welcome option. Quite a few hotels (despite 5 star status) dont provide internet for free. Free mini bar (water, canned drink & buts) is a nice option. The best part of the hotel I think is the 'Timeless' lounge concept. People who check out but want to relax a while or if check in is delayed, this smart lounge could be used. With a nespresso machine & apples & snack bites this is one of the nicest aspects I have ever come across in a star hotel. Very good dining options. There are three options.There is a Chinese fine dining restaurant at the 28th floor. Its pricey for that quality of food. However due to their possession of a wine preserver that can store opened wine fresh upto 21 days we can select quite a few wines by the glass.There is a Sommerlier who could suggest the wine combinations. That was nice. Next there is a simple lounge bar near the lobby to chill out. I ordered for couple of cocktails which were not bad & the tapas side dish choices were good. Then there is 'The Market' which has a plethora of dishes to choose from. I went there once and also ordered from them another time through room service. Good choice of food. I liked the Malaysian lamb satay & the Indian chicken curry. The staff are a little overwhelming but and a little more professional experience is needed. The hotel shuttle bus has a drop at i-SQUARE a mall in Tsim Sha Tsui. This is a better option compared to the 10-12 minute walk to Hung Hom or East Tsim Sha Tsui metro. One could take this shuttle bus and get dropped at iSQUARE & take the metro from Tsim Sha Tsui. The staff cud have recommended this instead. Because its another 10 minute walk (unpaid subway) from East Tsim Sha Tsui to Tsim Sha Tsui metro station.

The rooms were very well equipped, my husband particularly liked the coffee machine and the bathroom was wonderful. The service from all of the staff was great, nothing was too much trouble. Angie Lo in particular went out of her way to ensure we had information and timetables for everything we wanted to visit. The benefits which come with the Above & Beyond rooms, including the club on the 29th floor, breakfast, high tea & cocktails makes it very worthwhile along with the personal check in and check out. I will certainly be booking in again when I return with work in August.", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "iligan city", "Title": "\u201cBest Customer Service, Promising Hotel\u201d", "Author": "kim0404", "ReviewID": "UR110189389", "Content": "I have stay here the day after their opening with my husband. The moment you step inside the hotel you will be greeted by courteous smiling staff. The check in was a bit slow I think due to the new system. The room was big and spacious! We had the harbour view room and it has a fantastic view of the Victoria harbor at night. The Bed is of top quality, its soft but offers great support so our sleep was excellent. The bathroom is very nice. a deep soak tub with separate walk in rain shower. One thing I would recommend though is that they should have made the walk-in shower have a door , even a sliding glass so that it can be close and water wont get out. The floor in the bedroom was all wood, I would have preferred if it was carpeted, and there was no magazines. But the staff was excellent. My Husband got sick on the last day and i went out to buy medicines, one of the floor manager greeted me on the lift and we chit chatted and they were very kind enough to offer us a late check out free of charge since our flight was not till late in the evening and they sent a get well card along with a plate of fruits to our room. Most of the facilities aren't available yet. We were invited to the above and beyond floor by the club floor manager to have a little talk about our whole stay and what think of the hotel. It was a pleasant chat. Location: I love the location of the hotel! It is near the \" bar street\" where lines of open bars are open till late night, loads of restaurants near by to choose from, shopping centers, electronic shops and it is just a walk to the avenue of stars but the hotel it self is not in the middle of all this so you don't have to worry about street noise or loads of people outside the hotel. I say that this hotel is promising because Im sure when they are fully open it would be a five star experience for the guests with their spacious comfortable room, wonderful location and excellent staff and great facilities to look forward to...", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cDifferent in standard and confusion in Club Level\u201d", "Author": "Jasontan65", "ReviewID": "UR110071933", "Content": "Have stayed there 18/5-24/5 2011 for six nights at Club 38 Harbour View. Day of check-in,was very friendly and feel welcomed at Level 28 (Above & Beyond) with both Angie and Winnie (very sincere and eager to help) Breakfast at The Market was indeed nice (very prompt service), the pastry chef even remember to serve us Croissant for consecutive 5 days without us asking when on day one -my companion commented that the croissant taste nice and fresh. Special mention have to be given to CK, Charles and Chris@The Market (they will chat you up) and provide insight of the hotel! Here comes the Club floor, first two nights were good but subsequently was bad to worse! There seems to be confusion here and we have to keep telling them we have been booked on the Club Floor and here for the complimentary drinks. Each night, we have to check whether non-alcholic drinks are complimentary until 11pm. Even it was clearly stated in our welcome letter! We have given up after those not so nice experience (thinking we were some unwelcomed intruders). They can simply checked our room number and know for once we were booked on Club Floor and should be entiltled to those benefits. Overall, it was a wonderful stay and service is good except for the difference in standard between the Club and The Market.

I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Hong Kong as the hotel and location is excellent. It is close to both the train and metro station and anything else in Kowloon. I was staying at another hotel and was told about the Icon from a colleague. I walked over and was given an extensive tour from one of the staff that was very informative. I checked into the Icon the next day, it was a great decision on the move to the Icon. While it is still in its \"soft opening\" stage it is excellent and the staff go out of their way to make you feel relaxed and comfortable. I stayed in an Above & Beyond Club 65 Room and the view and furnishings are very good with a rain shower and deep soaker bath tub. You will appreciate all the free benefits and extras and the great staff at the Above & Beyond club program as the extra cost is well worth the Club experience. The view and club lounge on the 29thfloor are great as are the bar and Chinese restaurant.

Where some other hotels may also offer a gradn view of the Victoria Harbour, but nothing like the manificent view sitting in the Up and Above lounge, enjoying the nice wines and Chinese cuisine.

The shower is simply the best I have ever encountered. The super-large overhead shower head is a delight to use and the overall design of the shower area gave a very luxurious feel to the whole experience. I had dinner in the Chinese restaurant , which was simply excellent. The food was unusual; Cantonese but with a Western touch. Yum Yum.
