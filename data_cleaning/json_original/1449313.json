The wine reception was a nice touch for early evening apperitifs. The lounge area on the lobby floor is well appointed, as is the rest of the hotel. Kimpton Hotels where we have stayed do amazing jobs of retrofitting older buildings with great craftsmanship and character. We were pleased to see this was no exception. The amenities were great!. The room was spacious and a working set of pocket doors separated the bedroom area from the sitting area. There was a gigantic tub large enough and deep enough for two people to sit down on the built in banques and enjoy a whirlpool bath, which our son did. The rest of the bathroom was also nicely appointed. The plumbing, however, needs a check-up. This sink was very slow to drain and the toilet, in a separate water closet, had a tendency to splash up and out of the bowl. The HVAC system was apparently not able to cool down the room.

We decided to visit the Inner Harbor to celebrate Valentines Day and chose the Hotel Monaco based on our previous Kimpton stays. The building itself is beautiful, inside and out. I don't believe there are really any \"great\" views, as the area is surrounded by other tall buildings. The neighborhood leaves a little to be desired. Our room was immaculate and beautifully decorated. However, the AC was incredibly loud. We had to turn the TV up and down when it turned on and off. What set this property apart from others we have visited is the lack of attention to detail and service. If you want room service, be prepared to be underwhelmed. Breakfast is not available until 8am on the weekends (the room service menu states 7am, but we were informed by the in-room dining operator that this was incorrect and that we should have read the preorder menu on the door know. Not really our responsibility to proof the signage in the hotel), nor does the restaurant open before 8am on weekends. There is not an alternative near by either, unless you want fast food. The front desk staff on Saturday morning did not seem to think this was a problem, maybe because they were too concerned with setting up the conference room for a meeting, with breakfast type items. Saturday night we were tired and decided to order room service. The menu selections are few, which is shocking considering the quality and quantity available in the hotel restaurant. When our meal arrived we were somewhat surprised. I ordered a steak, but there was no steak knife and the silverware on the tray was dirty. My husband ordered a hamburger, but no condiments were provided. Additionally, there was not water, bread or butter on the tray. We had to call for the knife and condiments and wait while the food got cold. From stays at other Kimpton properties and other hotels we know this should not be the norm. Upon checkout we were asked about our stay. We told Simon at the front desk our concerns. He was the first employee we met at the hotel that seemed to care. He listened to us and removed the room service charge, assuring us he would make sure our experiences were relayed to management. We truly wanted to love this hotel and are sad to provide such a review, but this property was not up to Kimpton standards.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Waterloo, Canada", "Title": "\u201cfantastic building\u201d", "Author": "suzanne_baal", "ReviewID": "UR124965907", "Content": "The hotel building was gorgeous and our room was really nice. We got a deal on the room through SniqueAway and really found it tobe good value.

My only constructive feedback is that the room service menu was a bit limited, given that there is a restaurant right downstairs - I could have had better choices, speedier service, and likely paid less if I had just gone down and ordered take out. Also, the valet parking was consistently slow. We called ahead and waited for the car every time, making it an inconvenience rather than a convenience. The only 'convenient' part about valet parking was not having to actually park the car... But the hotel was lovely, the room was great, and it was a good experience.

The building itself is spectacular, and the rooms are more than adequate. I absolutely loved that they provided a pet goldfish for the duration of my stay as well. It really did help to make the room feel more like home. Unfortunately, the staff left something to be desired. On the day of our arrival, they said our room (with 2 queen beds) was not ready yet, but we could take a room with two double beds instead if we liked. We opted to wait for the Queen room, based on the notion that it would only be a \"short time\" until it was ready. FOUR hours later, they finally gave us a room key and sent us on our way. We went to the room, unpacked, immediately departed for dinner, and upon returning, went straight to bed - exhausted from a long and stressful day of travel. It wasn't until the next morning when I woke up that I realized the bed I was sleeping in was no queen, but a double. So we waited four hours just to get the room that was ready when we arrived instead of the room we paid for. Very disappointing. The room situation was corrected by the manager, but the new room had it's own trouble in the form of a non-functioning mini-fridge. I called the front desk about it, and they said that someone would be right up to repair. That someone did not arrive until 9pm. Normally I wouldn't call 9pm an unreasonably late hour, but when you're recovering from major surgery, iit seems like the middle of the night. Not when you want some unkempt maintenance man skulking around your bedroom. The final staff mistake - and the final straw for me - came the second day after surgery, which was my first day back from the hospital. My husband had flowers delivered (he was in Florida at the time) and they were meant to be in my room when I arrived back from Johns Hopkins. It was a suprise, so when they were not there I didn't think anything of it. Two or three days later, he finally brought it up on the phone since I hadn't mentioned it or said thank you. Needless to say, their absence generated an angry call to the front desk, and the flowers were eventually delivered - looking a bit worse-the-wear from having sat somewhere unattended for 3+ days before making their way to me. On a positive note, the hotel restaurant was wonderful and the bartender was a genius. Try is signature drinks - they're out of this world!

After reading reviews about people not having their special requests fulfilled, I reminded the gentleman who checked us in. He assured us that it would be in our room by the end of the day. Well, as of the day we checked out - we still didn't have a coffee maker. That's just unacceptable. If there was a shortage, just be honest. And if you forgot after multiple requests, well then you shouldn't have a job in customer service. We also had some issues with room service. We ordered in-room dinning twice and breakfast once. Both times we ordered dinner, the woman who took our order made comments regarding the amount of food that we ordered, which I felt was rather unprofessional and a bit insulting. We ordered a salad, two appetizers, and two club sandwiches. She was shocked that we were ordering so much food. How is that relevant? Do your job and take our order. Don't question our eating habits. How about you focus more on making sure everything is brought up to our room - since that was also an issue during our stay. Also, quite a few items on the in-room dinning menu were not available but listed on the menu. The last issue that was disappointing was an issue we experienced with the television in our bedroom. On our last night, was had all intentions to order a movie and relax in bed. Upon laying down and getting comfortable, we realized the on-demand service did not work in our bedroom. It was so late that we didn't want to watch it in the living room area, and it was also too late to complain. Oh well ... Again, we did enjoy the room. But after spending almost $1000 for 2 nights (which included mini-bar costs, room service and valet parking) I just don't think the service matched the cost. I would definitely try Kimpton again, but I'm not so sure about returning to the Hotel Monaco in Baltimore.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cWonderful hotel\u201d", "Author": "L S", "ReviewID": "UR122814911", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel Monaco to celebrate our engagement.

They called us after 10 minutes of our arrival and asked how we liked the accommodations and they wondered if they could help us get reservations. We decided to make reservations at the restaurant attached, The B&O Brassiere. We walked into the restaurant and were congratulated on our engagement, news spreads fast around this hotel. The food at B&O was decent. Nothing to be overly excited about. However, they do have AMAZING Maple Creme Brulee. The waitress at the restaurant was okay, not exceptional. The bathtub in this hotel room was massive, like a swimming pool (not really)!! The bathroom altogether was big and beautiful! The room was massive with a large king sized bed. It was very clean and came with a complimentary goldfish for our stay, I did feel bad that the fish was stuck in a tiny little bowl though. In the morning we ordered room service. The woman who took calls for room service was extremely professional and friendly. Our food was brought up to us within 20 minutes and we had everything we needed. The food was decent, nothing special but not terrible. One thing I would say is, bring your own sodas! A can of soda is $4 in the mini bar! Crazy! Overall, great hotel!

The hotel is a relatively quick $35 cab ride from BWI and just a few blocks from the inner harbor. Front desk staff were very welcoming and expedient upon our arrival. Our double queen room on the 12th floor was extremely spacious and perfect for the 4 of us. The beds were clean and comfortable and the bathroom was nice and spacious. However, the sliding door was a bit off ~ I would prefer a real door vs. the slider. We had a drink at the B&O Friday night which had a few customers at the bar and a few diners throughout the restaurant. Service was slow and they were not able to offer the wine presented on their bar menu. The hotel recommended Maisy's restaurant which is a bistro just a few blocks away. The restaurant and service was wonderful and we really enjoyed our home made crabcakes! We found it a bit odd that there seemed to be a lot of people lingering/sleeping in the lower part of the hotel lobby during the next day (Saturday) ~ It was not clear if these folks were just very tired hotel guests taking a break or non-hotel guests coming off the street and relaxing on the comfortable chairs/couches. We enjoyed walking around the inner harbor and took advantage of the good sales in the harbor shop mall. On Saturday night we went to Howl at the Moon dueling piano bar. This place is great and tons of fun! I highly recommend to anyone. The bar does not serve any food so you would want to eat prior if you planned on staying a while. Cover charge is $5 before 8:00pm and then increases to $10. The hotel completely missed the mark on our room service order. We called in for 4 sandwiches around 1:00am and waited close to an hour for extremely sub-par pulled pork sandwiches that were cold and somewhat tasteless. The gym is on the 3rd floor and is equipped with numerous cardio machines and free weights. The treadmills did not allow for headphones and the remotes some of the remotes were not in working order. The water taxi is a nice way to travel to Fells Point or other areas within the harbor. The fee is $10per person for an all day pass. Lots of the bars/pubs in Fells point have great bunch and drink specials on the weekends (ie, $10 for all you can drink bloody mary\u2019s or mimosa). Overall a good trip but if I went to Baltimore again I would stay right on the harbor or in Fells Point ~ we did not always feel 100% safe walking back to the hotel in the late evening hours. .

Perhaps it has something to do with not having to go through the lobby when coming or going from the hotel due to the design of the building. But the final straw came on my last morning. I was leaving early to catch a train and it was dark and raining. The doorman outside called me a town car instead of a cab. Two nights before i had the same experience and when i questioned the doorman, he assured me it was the same as a cab.I found that the driver did not know how to get to the convention center three blocks away and it cost me 2x as much as it should have! So when I balked he said it would be difficult to get another ride quickly. Reluctantly I took the town car which, yes, cost 2x the taxi cost. URRRGG!

The Kimpton chain prides itself on value, quiet elegance, and service--and all are in good supply at the Monaco Baltimore. I had booked a Deluxe King, but was upgraded, at no extra charge, to the Mediterranean Suite, which was absolutely lovely. Indeed, everything about this newly renovated hotel is lovely, evincing as it does the elegance of the golden years of the B&O Railroad, the enterprise occupying this grand structure before the Kimpton Chain acquired it. The refurbishing was very nicely done in that hotel guests are offered all the modern amenities, but not at the expense of the marble staircases and other original architectural features. Ahh, but it's the service that truly stands out! From the attentive valet and concierge service to the reservation staff all are superbly trained to be both welcoming and competent: here is congenial professionalism at its finest. I found little perks everywhere. For example, when I went to the front desk to see if I could get my e- boarding passes printed, Nicole smiled, took my papers, and had the passes printed in about three minutes. I left smiling, too. Checkout was quick and easy as well. Further, the Hotel is in a safe location and only about a ten to fifteen minute walk from the Inner Harbor. Oh, yes, and give the B & O American Brasserie a try. The menu is upscale but reasonable and the servers are some of the best I've encountered.

I've never been to Baltimore but was excited to stay at Hotel Monaco especially after reading the wonderful reviews. Upon arrival we were pleasantly greeted by valet who helped us out with our baggage. We entered the hotel doors to see the wonderful architect of this historical hotel. So gorg! Upon check-in we were asked if they wanted to make us reservations for dinner. We hadn't even thought that far in advanced and they were kind enough to show us a menu to Kali's Court where they also provided a driver service because it was located in Fells Point. So after looking at the menu we agreed to have dinner there. We then proceeded to our room which was located on the 14th (top) floor. The decor was beautiful. My fiance loved the leather wallpapered walls in the bathroom. We got the King suite that had a jacuzzi which had two seats in the tub. It was really large. I will say that after using the jacuzzi I probably won't get a room with that again. It wasn't that it was bad, but the jets weren't strong at all. We usually stay at hotels with the tub option and really enjoy the harder jets for our backs. This tub didn't have any pressure to the jets and was rather disappointed. Other than that the room was fabulous with amazing views of the city. We didn't get a chance to eat at the restaurant connected to the hotel. We were running around most of the day so we also missed out on the wine happy hour as well as the warm cookies. Hopefully we will be back to experience all that and more. I definitely would love to come back and may even bring my little dog. FYI, having dinner at Kali's Court the restaurant sends over a long white stretched limo to pick you up and bring you back if you have dinner with them. I was loving it! It was a nice surprise when we walked outside looking for our driver to see a limo was actually waiting for us. It felt very glamorous riding in that. Dinner wasn't overpriced but it was a pricey place. We loved all that we ate and would also love to come back to dine there again.

When I first entered the building, I was really impressed with the beautiful classic architecture. We arrived around 1pm, (check-in time was 3pm) and were hoping to go straight to our room, but the room wasn't ready. We made the very short walk to the harbor and came back to the hotel at 3:30, but our room still wasn't ready. As an apology, they gave us 4 drink vouchers for the bar on the first floor and told us our room would be ready in 30 more minutes. We went down to the bar, but didn't use the vouchers because we were full from the lunch we had at the harbor, so when we came back in, I asked if they could give us breakfast the next day instead. They agreed and we went up to a beautiful room. The beds were very comfortable although when I did the standard bed bug check (which I would do in ANY hotel), I discovered what looked like a pee stain on the mattress protector underneath the top sheet. I was tired from a long day of running around, so I didn't complain about it and just decided I would sleep on the other side of the bed. After the game, we got a great night's sleep and the blinds did a great job of blacking out the room. Breakfast was delicious, although I wouldn't have eaten there if it wasn't free because it was too pricey. Checkout went smoothly and when we exited the hotel, the bellhop asked if we needed a cab. We did, but instead of a (metered) cab, he signaled to a car that was parked in front of the hotel. When I found out how much that car was going to charge us to go to the train station, I was annoyed and I told him that I felt as if they were trying to take advantage of me. The bellhop told me that the car service is somehow affiliated with the hotel, (although I was upset and may not have heard him correctly), and then I said we'll just take a metered cab, which he promptly called. (There are tons of cabs on the street - similar to any other big city) Overall, I enjoyed my stay. The hotel was very close to the harbor and a 15-20 min walk to the stadium.

The first problem was minor: we arrived in the room and there was only 1 set of towels. Easy to fix with a phone call, but annoying that this call even needed to be made! Next problem: poor valet parking service the first time we tried it. The parking garage apparently is a block or so away, so you are supposed to call 10-20 minutes before you need the car. We did, but 20 minutes later, still no sign of the car. The attendant at the entrance said the valet was getting another car first, which made us wonder why there was just one valet person on duty for the whole hotel? The hotel charges $36 per day for valet parking; they surely can afford to hire more help. The total time to get the car was 30 minutes. They improved the next two times we asked for our car --15 to 20 min each time. Next problem: we ordered tea, coffee and two desserts (creme brulee and chocolate cake) from room service. The order arrived in a timely manner, but...the coffee cups were dirty, there were no napkins, no spoons for the dessert or the tea, there was no sugar or sweetener for the tea and coffee, and they brought up the wrong type of tea. We were really glad we didn't order anything more complicated! The person we spoke with about the problem really didn't want to listen to us; \"yes sir, what would you like us to do?\" was his response to my description of the problem. We asked for the items that were missing, and got some of them five minutes later (but not all of them!). We called the front desk, and asked for a message to be left for the manager, because we were unhappy with this situation. The manager called just a few minutes later and, while this response time was good, it was clear that she also really did not want to hear from us. She did take the charge off our bill. We go the same unapologetic attitude at check out; the desk clerk asked how our stay was, and we told him! He simply looked at our bill and said \"they took that off your bill\". A simple \"we're sorry\" would have sufficed, but perhaps they are trained not to admit mistakes at this hotel. The final problem occurred after checkout. We noticed a charge from the hotel which we did not recognize. Called the hotel, and they informed us it was a minibar charge. We did not use the minibar (didn't even know there was one...). Once again, no apology from the person I spoke with on the phone. Just a statement that she would credit our card. Very frustrating that we have to keep calling the hotel to get problems fixed.

The room was decorated well and it is a wonderful preservation of a historical building. The location was near JH for my husband's business, and near the Walter's Art museum for mine. The hotel owners have no control over the area, because this is a historical site, they have done an exceptional job of preserving and bringing it back into use. They protect it's occupants by providing security and room key dependent elevators. Cookies & milk and the wine were nice perks. We also appreciated the hospitality offered by the security guard the night we arrived. The lobby setting was quite nice to relax and have a coffee, or drink, a nice comfortable social setting, set to the side of the hotel front desk, offering privacy. The downsides for us were that it did not have cartoon network, this may sound silly but it is the channel our family looks forward to when we travel. It offers entertainment for our family at all hours, unlike nick and disney which were offered, but usually run with pre-teen targeted shows. Not appealing for our 3 and 5 year olds, plus as adults once the girls go to sleep, we enjoy adult swim rather than the plethora of reality shows. The hotel, with its channel line-up, seemed geared to the average reality-show fake-drama entertaining of 20-somethings. The curtains in the room are nice and look nice, but do not block out 100% of the light, mainly because they sit inside the window frame, so morning light seeps between the wall and the curtain. Pay $10/ day for internet, I am unsure why a 4 star hotel must charge extra for the internet, they charge extra for the room and seldom offer free breakfast, business travelers depend on the internet and knowing that I feel like hotels like this one, are just getting another $10/ day. (4 stars, for lacking a good channel-line-up & curtain issue, & internet, if fire alarm had not gone off) We were there the night the alarms went off.

(Many homeless people sleep on nearby steps-which I am glad Baltimore allows this, since some cities \"clean\" this up for appearances, which is a lack of freedom IMO, however, I used this to describe the locale) As I mentioned before the hotel protects it's occupants by supplying safety elements, so I was surprised when none of the hotel staff were notifying us of anything. The only person walking around was the security guard. Some of the guests were concerned about the alarms being a set-up so someone could go into their rooms to steal things. Several people were with small children and could have been offered a blanket. It was another guest that offered such hospitality to us, rather than hotel staff. Most of us thought it was a fire-alarm malfunction, since no one seemed concerned, as if this has happened before. I would think that there would have been some sort of room check-off or occupant check-off to ensure no-one was left in their room had this been a \"real\" emergency.

Guests were commenting that one of the fire exits was blocked as they tried to leave the building so they had to double back and exit through the lobby. No smoke or flames were visable while we shivered in the night air outside in this dingy neighborhood. The fire trucks didn't arrive for about 20+ mins and the firemen were not decked out in any kind of fire fighting gear. Instead, they casually entered the building and went to talk to management. Inquiring guests found out that no one from the hotel called 9-1-1 initially. Meanwhile, we were completely unsupervised and guests were actually heading back into the building to keep warm. No staff came out to tell us what was happening or what to expect. This seemed very irresponsible for the hotel management to leave us to our devices since if this were a real fire, we certainly shouldn't be anywhere near the building. When the firemen returned to their trucks, they told us we could go back in. No hotel manager, no staff, no one from the hotel came to see us all back in the building. To make matters worse, guests were calling up to the hotel lobby from their cell phones and the staff seemed to not know what to say but were certainly not interested in making sure our fears were averted. Over one hour passed from the time we were woken and were allowed to return to our rooms. About 2 hours later, the alarms went off again. This time we called down to the front desk who told us that this was a malfunction which left us really uneasy about the safety of the building. The alarm and flashing lights in the room continued to sound and flash for at least 40+ minutes. Needless to say, this proved to be a very sleepless night. To make matters even worse, the complimentary coffee in the lobby in the morning was weak, not hot and like dirty dish water. False alarms continued into the following day.

Visually, the hotel is as close to functional art work.as it can get. Resturant at hotel was borderline eh, and ok. Only had breakfast there. My only minor complaint, the hallway was hot. The room I was in, AC worked flawless. Very comfortable in the room. Also, tried room service twice (late night), both times unavailable. But they gave us numbers to places that delivered late, problem solved. There was a dog, so i'm assuming its pet friendly. But the quesion is, would I stay there again? Without a doubt, YES. Would I recommend it to others, I'm telling you to give it a try.

Our room was a two double bed room. The room was cozy...a little small, but we didn't feel crunched in. The room had a \"bonus\" room, which was very odd. The bonus room was empty and really had no function as it was very small and probably could double as another closet. The bathroom and room were very clean, even spotless. The kids enjoyed complimentary cookies and milk in the afternoon. The hotel also had a Wii gaming system available in one of the lobbies for the guests to use. The hotel is very close to most attractions. We walked to Camden Yards for a Baltimore Orioles game. The Ravens stadium is just a little further, but certainly within walking distance. The National Aquarium and the Inner Harbor are also just a short walk from the hotel. The B&O Brasserie Restaurant at the hotel was clean and had courteous service.

Last summer, we needed a break from the stresses of life, but money was tight, so we stayed in area. We live in Baltimore, but I never actually spent time at the harbor; so for our stay-cation, we made accommodations at the Hotel Monaco in Baltimore \u2013 and we got spoiled! When we booked the room, we originally intended on seeing different attractions in the area, but once we got to the room, it was hard to leave! First of all, we loved the luxurious d\u00e9cor and the warm colors, both inside the room and throughout the hotel. We also fell in love the huge king size bed; now our queen-sized bed at home, (or anywhere else we stay), seems too small. We also loved the spacious and alluring bathroom; now, when we stay anywhere else, we feel like the bathroom is inadequate - no matter how nice it may seem. We also loved the fact that we could control the temperature of the room instead of just having the air either off or on. We were also glad that the room had a flat screen TV (like what we have at home), and that the cable was NOT limited (like it is in other hotels). In our entire three-day stay, we only left the room maybe three times; out of those three times, we only actually left the hotel once. The other two times we left our room, was to eat at the hotel\u2019s restaurant (where the food and service was exceptional) and to explore the rest of the hotel. My husband and I have very sedentary lifestyles, but we even loved the gym! We actually worked out together and had fun (which was something we always wanted to do but had never done). We have nothing but good things to say about this hotel chain. Our stay at the Hotel Monaco in Baltimore was an experience that we will always remember. It was just what we needed. Our only disappointment is that we couldn\u2019t stay longer. We got married this year (in May), and wanted to stay at Hotel Monaco again, but money is still tight. We didn\u2019t even have a wedding, (just a very small, short private ceremony.) We stayed somewhere cheaper (about 30 minutes from home). It actually pretty nice, but it wasn\u2019t the same. We kept comparing everything to Hotel Monaco and didn\u2019t enjoy our time the way we could have. So I want to surprise my husband by staying at the Hotel Monaco in Baltimore for his birthday in December. I don\u2019t get excited about many things, (and neither does he), but I can\u2019t wait to stay here again!

If you do venture out, stay on the main streets that are busy and you should have no issues. The B&O American Brasserie (the hotel's restaurant on the 1st floor) was pretty good for cocktail hour. It wasn't busy when we sat down around 3:30 pm on a Friday. We ordered the flatbread (their version of a pizza) which was surprisingly very tasty. Our food sat on the counter for about 5 minutes because the waiter left the room. It was slightly annoying, but nothing detrimental. We went back for breakfast the following morning. The food was very underwhelming. After 4pm, the hotel offers warm cookies and milk at the check-in desk. Some of the best chocolate chip cookies I've had. They were even cut in squares! After 6pm, the hotel offers white and red wine and sangria. We didn't take advantage, though. We also worked out in the hotel's gym on the third floor. It was completely empty when we arrived (10pm on Saturday), and there were plenty of clean machines in working order (ellipticals, treadmills, exercise bikes) along with weights, plentiful clean towels and water. The flat screen TV on the wall and on each machine was a nice added touch. The only negative I have to comment on would be the maid service. The maid came in while we were in the room, and she didn't stay longer than 5 minutes. With a four star hotel, I would expect a thorough cleaning of the bathroom, fresh linens, dusting and vacuuming, none of which occurred. She didn't arrange the complimentary toiletries properly, but instead kind of threw them on the sink. And, one of the new washcloths put in the bathroom had several pubic hairs attached to it. If I didn't look closely, I would have washed my face with it. All in all, this is a great hotel with plenty of great amenities, friendly and accommodating staff in an awesome central location. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denver, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cA Resounding Thud\u201d", "Author": "GlobalTripper007", "ReviewID": "UR114888347", "Content": "The Hotel Monaco is located in the historic B&O Railroad building, a few blocks from Baltimore's Inner Harbor area.

When I returned to my room after being out for the day, I found that it had not been serviced. A call to Guest Services yielded the following, \"Well, are you sure you there wasn't a sign out.\" Nope, no sign. The front desk staff looked at my clothes before I showered and dressed for dinner and recommended a place I entered and exited in one motion.

My friend called me for a hotel recommendation because I\u2019m always planning something. Remembering our romantic room in Florida, I checked to see if there was a Kimpton in Baltimore. I don\u2019t\u2019 usually make referrals to hotels unless I\u2019ve stayed there, but based on my experience at the Vero Beach Kimpton I took a chance. As luck would have it, I found the Hotel Monaco. I checked the pic\u2019s on the web site and called to check reservation availability \u2013 I was looking for the romance package which was unfortunately sold out \u2013 but I booked the hotel anyway on line for the anniversary couple. I wrote in the comments that this was a very special occasion and a surprise. I also mentioned that the wife would like to check in early in order to apply romantic touches to the room. This weekend was also be Father\u2019s day. I then prayed everything would go well and went off to my Father\u2019s day weekend at the Palomar (Kimpton) in Philadelphia \u2013 also very very nice. Well, Monday morning, my friend couldn\u2019t contact me fast enough to sing the praises of the Baltimore Monaco hotel. The room was better than her friend imagined (beauty and comfort) and the staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating. The front desk even found her a discounted rate which was better than the rate I found for them. My friends friend couldn\u2019t have been more pleased and the weekend was \u201coh so romantic\u201d. Therefore I am once again singing the praises of Kimpton and I now feel confident that I can refer the hotels (whether I\u2019ve stayed there or not) to my friends and family and not worry they\u2019ll have a bad experience. Also, and very important, both my friend and my referral reputations remain intact. Smile. My friend said that her friend was so happy, she was singing the praises of the hotel and recommending it at work all day Monday. In closing, to top it off the weekend, when the wife brought her husband back later that afternoon to begin the surprise, as she was walking him blindfolded through the lobby they ran into a well known comedian who joked about the kidnapping and gave them passes to his comedy show to help them celebrate the occasion. I\u2019d like to attribute that in part to the Kimpton culture\u2026 if you\u2019re happy, then everyone around you is happier. The whole pay it forward thing. You\u2019re nice to me, I\u2019m nice to the next person\u2026. Etc. Anyway, thanks to the Monaco hotel. I can\u2019t wait to give you a try myself.

I had read some very good reviews of the eatery and was looking forward to eating there. Service and the food was very good. We got a South American malbec that I am still dreaming about. However, I was looking forward to the fish dishes that I had read about online. We found out that the menu I read was from the previous chef that had been gone a couple of times. Time to put the new menu/information up on the internet. The next day we wandered up to the Walters Museum. We spent most of the afternoon there and had to leave before we got to every area since they were closing. What an incredible collection. That evening we went to a cabaret at the Center Stage that is several blocks north. When we arrived back to our room there was a card with an earring that I had lost during the wine hour in the lobby. Marta, the front desk assistant had found it and brought it to my room and left the nicest note. That is service! She could have left it at the front desk and called to have us come down for it which I would have gladly done.

There's an elevator and a staircase that would make Scarlett O'Hara green with envy. I was here on a holiday weekend for a night, so things were kind of slow. That was fine with me since I got into the room very early--and got the stand-by e-upgrade to a Mediterranean Suite. (If you aren't familiar with Kimpton's stand-by e-upgrade program, you should check it out. After you make your reservation, you'll receive an e-mail offering you the chance to stand-by for upgrades to higher-level rooms for lower rates. At check-in-, if the room is available, you get it. If not, you get your reserved room. I ended up with the suite for $149, only $40 more than the standard room I booked.) There's a pleasant parlor off the lobby (high ceilings) where the complimentary wine reception is held every evening. We had champagne at ours. Very nice. The Med Suites are the Mac Daddy. 800+ square feet with a large living room with comfy sofa and chair, table, and big flat screen. There were two big windows looking out over downtown Baltimore, which has some architectural gems in addition to the Monaco. (The Bank of America building is just down the street and is great to have for your view.) Around a corner is the bedroom, which had a curved wall so a 180-degree view. It's really just a comfy bed with two nightstands, but good lighting and a classy deco headboard. The electronics are good, with another flat-screen and an easy-to-use iPod dock. The bathroom was the crowning glory. Large and open, with separate shower and an amazing Jacuzzi tub for two. Absolutely huge--even a step up to get into it. Bathroom could have used a little more counter space, but otherwise perfect. You could even look out the window from the tub if you left the door open. All the Kimpton goodies are here, including the goldfish companion (I had two, so even my goldfish companion had a companion) and the $10 free mini-bar raid for InTouch members. The B&O restaurant was a little austere in decor, but the nibbles I had were great--the crab bisque and some awesome gruyere mac-and-cheese croquettes. It also has a creative and worthwhile cocktail and beer list. Not sure if B&O does the room service menu or not, but anyway it's capable if a little plain. I've checked out several hotels in Baltimore, and this is probably the best other than its being a little back from the Inner Harbor.

The room was very spacious, and we liked the unique Kimpton decor. I got a kick out of the animal-print bathrobes. We slept very well - the bed was very comfortable, the window shades blocked out most light, and we could not hear any noise from the hallway or adjoining rooms. Toiletries were Aveda and smelled lovely. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the shower -- instead of a curtain, it had a clear glass panel that only went halfway across. While this successfully kept the majority of water inside, it meant that I got goosebumps while showering because the colder air from the bathroom could get into the shower unimpeded. Front desk staff was excellent both upon check-in and check-out. We booked our room through Priceline (for a steal), and they made no mention of this nor did I feel we were treated any differently because of it. The hotel also has fun perks, like an evening wine hour (the zinfandel they were serving during our stay was very good) and the ability to have a goldfish delivered to your room (which we took advantage of, just because we could). Location is very good, as it is an easy 15 minute walk to the inner harbor area. The only major disappointment of our stay was the valet service. This hotel does not offer self-park, so you are forced to use the valets. However, when we first pulled up to hotel to check in, the valet was clearly understaffed, as there were 4 or 5 cars waiting for the valets to come take their keys. When we returned to the hotel after dinner, there was no line, but there was also no valet. We waited in the car 5 minutes before I finally got out of the car and went inside to see if I could find someone (the valet apparently came and got our car shortly after I left). Finally, when we checked out, we similarly had to wait several minutes before we located a valet. Given the very high price of valet parking ($36) and the fact guests are not given any other option, I was unimpressed.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cLittle Perks throughout this Historic Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nanci_Dru", "ReviewID": "UR87632160", "Content": "I stayed here one night for a work meeting.

It was large, with a nice entryway, flatscreen TV and large windows. The bathroom was very trendy, with faux leather walls and a beautiful tile walk-in shower. There were robes, Aveda toiletries, and an umbrella for use. It was a very nice room. My only complaint was the temperature control. The hallways were like a sauna, and I simply could not get the thermostat regulated in the room, which resulted in poor sleep. The bed was relatively comfortable and had a nice duvet and pillows but was not as comfortable as other hotels. All in all, I would definitely stay here again.

It's rather pricey, though I recieved a significant discount through the discount agency I used. This is one of the few hotels that I have stayed at about which I cannot think of a single derogatory remark. As other reviewers have remarked, it is a boutique hotel in a restored historic building which used to be the B&O headquarters and has been lovingly restored. It's in a good location - about 15 minutes walk to the Inner Harbor and about that to the Mount Vernon historic district. The lobby is all marble and guilt old-fashioned splendor and the rooms are very large with tall ceilings. The rooms are tastefully decorated, with free wifi. The bathrooms are large and also marble. I can't say much about the view, as mine was a panoramic view of an adjacent wall 20 feet away. The hotel has an excellent restaurant with room service and plenty of nice restaurants within walking distance. My discounted price included a continental breakfast. It was nice, but included nothing special outside of the usual cold cereal, fruit and pastry offerings. As this is a Kimpton hotel there are plenty of extras such as in-room spa service (prices around $135) for message and aromatic wraps of which I did not avail myself. They have a milk and cookies hour in the afternoon and also a wine hour in the \"living room\" off the reception area. One of the weirder perks is that guests may request the services of a \"companion goldfish\" gratis. I asked the receptionist \"Seriously?

Even big dogs, and go out of their way to welcome and accomodate them. I highly recommend this hotel if you are traveling with Rover or Tigger.

Overall, we think that - based upon hotel character, overall cost, hotel staff, room size & cleanliness, and location - it would be a challenge to find a better hotel in Baltimore. When choosing a hotel, my wife and I tend to select 4 & 5 star hotels that are historic, posses traditionally decorated common areas (late 19th or early 20th century), and are located within the center of the city and/or center of the city's historic district. Hotel Monaco fell into this category quite well. In addition to being located within Baltimore, the hotel was clean, quiet, and well decorated. The location of the hotel allowed us to walk to the Inner Harbor (10 minutes), Little Italy (20 minutes), and Fells Point (30 minutes). We generally do not use hotel amenities such as the pool or work out facilities so we are not sure if these amenities exist or meet typical standards. The Hotel Monaco appears to be very pet friendly as we saw dogs frequently in the hallways and common areas. Checking in was easy (reception is on the second floor of the hotel). We reserved a 'King Deluxe' Room and upon check-in were assigned room 805. Our room was not completely ready for us when we arrived so we headed straight to the hotel bar for a well earned drink while we waited for the room to be completed (the pleasant gentlemen at the reception desk gave us several free drink vouchers that we gladly redeemed for a few afternoon refreshments). It wasn't long before we made our way up to our room. The room was big (375 square feet according to the hotel website) with high ceilings and provided great natural lighting. Overall, the room and bathroom were clean with modern decorations. Both the large king bed and the accompanying bedding were very comfortable. The room provided a city view that faced towards the Inner Harbor. We couldn't see the water due to the surrounding buildings, but the lack of a tall building next to the hotel gave us the benefit of natural light. There was only one very small drawback to the room - the air conditioning. The A/C unit was a bit loud and turned on and off constantly all night long (presumably due to the 100 degree July heat). Not a big deal for us - but it could be if you are a very light sleeper. Our trip to Baltimore was meant as a night away from home so we were not interested in exploring the typical tourist attractions. Our goal was to take relaxing walks through the city and along the waterfront to observe the culture and the architecture. If you are interested in exploring the city then Fells Point, the Inner Harbor, Little Italy, Sports Venues (M & T Bank Stadium and Camden Yards), the Aquarium, and Fort McHenry are within easy reach (either a relatively short walk or via the Water Taxi system). As for food \u2013 there are a lot of good restaurants in the city that the concierge can point out. We highly recommend a snack or meal in the Hotel Restaurant, the B & O American Brasserie. Arriving: We were travelling to Baltimore from the Washington DC area so we had several travel options available to us (drive, bus, cab, train, etc). We decided to take the 45 minute train ride (on Amtrak) from Washington's Union Station to Baltimore's Pennsylvania Station (i.e., Penn Station). For us it was a convenient choice. As an added incentive, the hotel was offering a 'Ride the Rails' package that entitled us to a 15% room rate discount if we took the train - simply book this package and show your train ticket at check-in to qualify for the special rate. Once we arrived at Penn Station we had the choice of taking either a 5 minute cab ride or a 45 minute walk to the hotel. Arriving in Baltimore on a hot and humid July day we made the obvious choice - we walked! As it turns out, this was not that bad of a choice for us. The walk was straight forward and downhill (exit the station, turn left, make your first right onto St. Paul street, walk 1.5 miles, turn right onto East Fayette Street, first left onto North Charles Street and you have arrived at the hotel). As an added bonus, the walk allowed us to see the terrific exterior details of some traditional Baltimore buildings. Departing: We checked out of the room at noon and left our bags at the reception desk for a couple of hours so that we could finish exploring the city. Upon returning to the hotel later in the afternoon, we picked up our bags (the doorman brought them from the second floor reception area to the front door) and grabbed a taxi to the Penn Station (having walked around the city for two days we decided that a cab to the train station was the right choice!). The taxi was new (an unmarked black sedan) and the 5 minute ride cost us $10. The driver (Moneeb) was friendly and we would recommend calling him if you need a car (410-926-4366).

The location was not quite central (it was in what felt like a business district, which at night and on the weekend felt a little deserted). However, the hotel itself was very nice and we enjoyed our stay. It was an easy walk to the harbor. Rooms were large - we had a double room, which worked out fine for four people (2 adults, a 13 and 16 year old). I had noted on my reservation that we would be bringing our dog (no extra charge), and when we arrived, there was even a small dog bed and dog dish of food/water for our pet! Staff was friendly.

Had I not brought the paperwork, read the fine print, and asked the front desk we wouldn't have received our breakfast. I really am wowed by all the positive reviews on this site. I don't consider myself a picky traveler and was not impressed by this hotel. Had I been staying at an inexpensive chain, I would be satisfied. But considering this is a 4 star hotel I was disappointed and would not return.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Bath Robes!\u201d", "Author": "WnnaBTrvlWrtr", "ReviewID": "UR69968382", "Content": "The Monaco Hotels have always been pretty high on my list -- I've always liked the chic design, the goldfish, and the Aveda toiletries -- but the addition of zebra and leopard print bathrobes has sealed the deal!

Very warm, comfortable hotel with very good amenities\u201d", "Author": "Unbiased&FairAdvisor", "ReviewID": "UR69353587", "Content": "A very good, clean, comfortable hotel with very nice staff. Comfortable room with some wonderful amenities offered throughout the day. The hotel is very convenient, within walking-blocks from the Inner Harbor and Camden Yards. It does however feel a little isolated/deserted, given it is amongst what seems to be office buildings ... but just not many people on the streets, day or night, and there are some 'homeless'/street people in the area. We had no problems however, with its location. The hotel, oddly, is in a converted office building (?), sharing the building with offices. Upon entering the hotel, you are greeted to a classic, marble lobby for the building and then a sign ... pointing to use the left elevators for the hotel and the right elevators for the offices. You must go to the hotel's \"lobby\" (next level up), to register. Not a biggie, but seemed odd .... Let's move on to our review: Room & Amenities: Very nice room, with king size bed, lacquer-red credenza/desk, chair, LCD TV, along with in-room safe inside the closet that included (2) 'stylish' (think tiger stripes!) bathrobes and an umbrella. These are nice touches to details! Some other hotels have only 1 robe-always white or no umbrella ! The bed was super comfortable, not too firm, not too soft. The bathroom was very spacious, with walk-in shower (no tub). We asked one of the cleaning people to just see another room as a comparison, and that one was larger with tub and a couch too ! We probably got a smaller room, given we went the Priceline route (on the cheap!) Back to the room: high ceilings, eclectic colors including red credenza/desk, gold wall paper, blue fabric headboard panels, trunk-style nightstands, paisley rolling curtains, but all of it was very tasteful and worked fine. We wish the curtains had more blackout-coverage, as we awoke to streams of sunlight (through the sides) each morning, but thankfully not hungover which would have made it worse. A mini-bar and chargeable snacks were available, along with a list in the bathroom, of beyond-the-basic toiletries available, optional items you may have forgotten - some free, some not, but again nice touch! Now on to the amenities, which we really enjoyed: in their \"Living Room\" ... a sitting area near the front desk, had an eclectic collection of chairs, couches, and sofas for guests, with a pseudo-fireplace, the hotel provided some tasty treats throughout the day. In the morning, coffee, tea, etc (not full breakfast), early afternoon = cold lemonade and cold tea, mid afternoon = fresh chocolate chip cookies and milk, evenings = wine tasting..... again, nice touches ! There is a gym/fitness center that was nice. We did not try the hotel's restaurant, B&O American bistro ... menu seemed ok, but pricey like all hotel restaurants. We had one pet peeve ... the business center that provided (2) computers with a printer was chargeable. Presumably, as Kimpton loyalty members, we wouldn't be charged, but we weren't going to bother using the ones there, as it requested a credit card. Instead, we accessed the internet free-of-charge in our room. Service: Very nice staff. Front desk was friendly. We did not request in-room dining, so cannot comment. Cleaning people were super nice (especially the one who allowed us to see another room to compare), and friendly. The room was always perfect when we returned, clean and with no issues. Doormen: minimal greeting and acknowledgment, probably because we didn't need them, but we're ok with that. Summary: A very good, clean, comfortable hotel with pleasant staff ... and most fetching, the drinks and treats throughout the day. As we noted above, there were nice detail touches we noticed throughout our stay there. It is very convenient to the Inner Harbor and Camden Yards, as well as public transportation options. Useful Tip: Getting around: use the \"Charm City Circulator\" bus = FREE of charge for (2) lines: Purple and Orange.

I had reservations, since I generally don't like hotels in older structures. This one is wonderful! The rooms and hallways are very fresh, interesting, and beautifully appointed. Lots of outlets in convenient places (I usually hate the old, painted over, and limited outlets in older hotels); high ceilings, but appropriately scaled -- I don't like the proportions of the rooms at the Hotel Monaco in DC -- it feels very retrofitted. Bathroom fixtures are brushed nickel and high quality. Very comfortable bed with white high thread-count sheets and douvet. I got the \"summer\" package -- for an extra $10 above the base rate, I got $25 credit in the bistro downstairs (nice lunch), $10 credit to \"raid the mini-bar\"; free valet parking ($36/day for guests); and one free movie per day. The lobby is typically Kimpton -- interesting, comfortable, and a little quirky. The entrance is a little off-putting -- HUGE marble entry that doubles as the entrance to a large business-oriented old-bank-style building.

We were not disapointed! The hotel is beautiful! It is located on most, but not all, of the floors of the old B&O Railroad building. The first impression came from the friendly doorman, and the stunning lobby. We took the elevator instead of the beautiful staircase to checkin, and we soon in our room. When I booked the room I booked a King Spa Room, but at checkin we were given a Mediterranean Suite. The room was gorgeous, with a nice living room with big LG tv, couch, chair, and closet with a safe. The hotel offers 'companion goldfish' but ours was dead (we named him Bob). We called down and another (Al) was up within minutes. The king bed was very comfortable, but the highlight of the suite was the bathroom. It was in the corner of the building, and had and angled wall for some architectural interest, and an incredible, deep spa tub. Overall the room was incredible, with only two small complaints, both identical to the next review on the list...our iron leaked water and the AC struggles to keep the room cool. To sleep comfortably we had to turn the thermostat down to 65. I was till warm, but my girlfriend was comfortable, and she likes being warm, normally keeping her thermostat at about 72. As far as the rest of the hotel, every single staff member we encountered was warm and friendly, everyone at checkin, the bartender Eric, the guy bringing a new goldfish, the girl bringing breakfast, the housekeeper, the door staff, the concierge, even random employees in the elevator were all very friendly, and even funny. Great as the room was, the staff were even better. We enjoyed a few glasses of wine at the evening wine reception, and noticed that when a couple showed up for the reception with a kid around 10-12 years old a staff member quickly brought out controllers and games for the Wii in the reception lounge. We ate in the restaurant one night, and it was good...not superb, but we only had a burger and fish and chips. It wasn't cheap, but not outrageous either. Over two nights we had two great bottles of wine, both based on the recommendations of Eric at the bar. Nice guy, and a great bartender! We had room service breakfast both days, the first morning we had the B&O Breakfast, which was eggs, bacon/sausage/ham and potatoes with toast and coffee...we both thought there was something odd about the eggs...both taste and texture just werent right...but the rest was good...but it wasnt cheap. The next day we got two continental breakfasts-danish, croissant, and muffin along with some great fruit, a huge glass of fresh juice and coffee. It was good, and really a much better value. Several other reviews mention location as a downside of this hotel, and if you are looking for a harbor view it's not for you. I also wouldnt venture too far on foot at night, but the same can be said for a lot of downtown areas. However, in daylight the walk to the harbor is not far, and feels perfectly safe. At night, I'd say take a cab. We ate dinner at a great local seafood place on the water, The Rusty Scupper, and they offer a free shuttle that picks up at the hotel. Guest services were happy to make reservations and arrange the shuttle for us. If all you want in Baltimore is a harbor view move on from the Hotel Monaco, but if you dont mind a short walk or cab ride and want a gorgeous hotel with character and an incredible staff, try this one instead. It's worth it, just don't expect ice cold AC and a good iron. But do get the fish.

One of the best parts about this is that nobody was trying to sell you anything or bother you in any way. The message was simple - come to our wine hour to enjoy all of the (great!) wine that you'd like, and make use of our lux lobby. It was so relaxing and such a nice bonus. They also had a milk and cookie hour that we didn't attend, but thought the idea was adorable. (Also, loved the fact that they had a Wii in their hotel lobby too.. would have never expected it!) The room was so clean, that I would believe it if we were the first 2 poeple to stay in it. I'm not sure if all of the rooms have a soaking tub, but try to book one that does. It was SO nice. The room was huge with tall ceilings and decorated to the 9s. My only very very slight complaint is that our AC turned off while we were sleeping (i think that it's motion sensored) and it got a little warm. Simple enough to get up and restart it though. The comfort of the bed made up for it. When we walked in there was a sign welcoming a canine guest of the hotel, along with a bowl of treats and water, and directions to the closest dog park (so cute!). I regret not bringing my dog because they had a lot to offer for the pooches! She'll be coming with us next time :) PS: based on the cleanliness of the hotel, you'd have NO idea that it was pet friendly. Finally, the location can't be beat. It is directly in between Camden Yards and the Inner Harbor so we always had somewhere close to go. We parked our car at the hotel and didn't need to use it once, and never had to call a cab. The surrounding areas were safe enough (it is Baltimore..). We walked around late at night with no problems. You'd be making a mistake in not staying at this hotel.

We had booked a special rate for the basic \"Deluxe King\" room, but upon check-in they informed us of a free upgrade to their corner Mediterranean Suite! A great deal for $159 a night! Let me back up to the arrival process though...I've read comments on here about unhelpful bell-hops and parking attendants, but we found the opposite to be true. There were several young men manning the stand, and we were promptly greeted and assisted from unloading our bags all the way to a tour of our suite. You enter on the main floor of the old B&O headquarters building which is beautiful with all of the marble and historic-register staircases. Your greeter will accompany you to the Monaco's lobby which is on the second floor of the building. There is a large and inviting lounge with fireplace where they have their evening wine receptions. The check-in staff were all very friendly, and gave us all of the information that we needed for our stay. Our greeter then took us to our suite and gave us an orientation of the facilities, pointing out the safe, closet, hairdryer, etc. The suite itself was a nice size with separate living room and bedroom. The ceilings were 11-12' tall and the walls were covered with tall windows that had shades as well as sheer coverings. The bathroom was huge-all done in brown marble with a tile pattern on the wall of the jetted tub/shower. I could not hear a peep from the hallway or other guest rooms. I could hear some Charles St traffic, but after all, you are in a city on Baltimore's major north-south street. It's to be expected. The decor was toned down from your usual Kimpton loud-crazy-fabric choices, but still unique. To address comments of safety, perhaps those people did not understand the location away from the Inner Harbor that is more city-focused than tourist-focused. Baltimore is a bit gritty, but if you know that, then you understand it. I would caution a late night walk to the northwest, (Fayette-Howard intersection and Northwest of that) but any walk towards the Inner Harbor (south and east) should be just fine, when done with a partner or group. Just use common sense. It was also very convenient to the convention center and not terribly far from the Mt Vernon area (Wash monument). Our check-out was first-class as well. Big Dave took care of us and even took us on a bit of a photo-shoot, getting pictures of us in various spots in the hotel. All of this was done I am sure, to keep us from having to stand and wait while they brought our car from its parking location. I had two issues, but I put them at the end, because I did not want to deter readers from the positives of the property (and I think that most people can figure out that one negative review is the true minority when the hotel is #2 in the city)...first the HVAC was working overtime to cool the room. This was a cloudy, cool day, so I worry about the summer heat. The management may want to check on this. Second there was a strong smell in the room and in the hallway. My husband could not smell it, but he has a lot of trouble with allergies...I am not sure if it was off-gassing of carpet, wallpaper, etc or something else. I would have to honestly say that it smelled like a skunk. It could potentially deter people, and may be what the woman who wrote the bad review on May 24 was talking about.

My wonderful husband and I had a reservation at this hotel, which was rated as a 4 star hotel by Hotwire. Whoever came up with this rating was either paid off to do so, or doesn't get out much, if at all. That is, unless you find homeless people camped out in front of hotel property appealing. If that's not your thing, you can find people urinating within a stones throw of the property, if not directly right on it. Within 1 minute of getting to the hotel, I was on the phone with Hotwire telling them that we were not staying there. They insisted for some reason that we at least complete the check-in process before they could properly and thoroughly process my complaint. When we pulled up our car to the Valet stand, the guy supposedly \"helping\" did not lift a finger. My husband took the bags out himself!!! I even told this person that my husband has a bad back, but that didn't inspire him to help in any way whatsoever! Then, the next step was to bring our luggage up to our room. The same guy said \"the lugguage doesn't fit in the elevator\" Any simpleton would have known that all that had to be done was to turn the bags sideways . Speaking of fits, that's when I had one, and I announced to my husband that I would rather sleep in the car than stay there. He said he wanted to look at the room since it was very late at night and hotel rooms in Baltimore on that night were scarce. I waited downstairs for him. He came downstairs 2 minutes later with all of the luggage. He said\"you would have hated it\" I replied, \"no kidding\". This place brought out the worst in me, for sure! My husband, my favorite person on earth BTW, told me that the stench was horrible, and the bed was equipped with 2 double beds!!!!!! I was assured I was getting a King when we booked the reservation by phone. I was back on the phone with Hotwire within 1 minute telling them that I didn't care what their policy is. My policy is to never gett ripped off. They complied and gave us an apology with a full refund and even extra $ in hopes that we would give them another chance with a new reservation.

I am an extremely light sleeper and found our first room--a lovely suite overlooking Charles Street to be way too loud for me. (I live on a very quiet four acres in Chapel Hill.) When I asked if we could be moved to a quieter suite the next day, the Kimpton management was very accommodating. We moved to a quieter suite, but, the truth be told, it was still a bit loud for me. The next morning, a lovely gentleman (Big Dave) at the front desk asked me if I had slept well. I said I had slept somewhat poorly, but acknowledged I was a tough sell. He said the Kimpton could do better and arranged to move me and my family to yet another room--a psuedo-suite overlooking a back alley (not what most suite seekers would have chosen) which was blessedly quiet. I slept like a rock. I really can't say enough about how this hotel goes the extra mile for guests. Free coffee in the mornings (although they did keep running out of half and half), free wine in the evenings, free internet, free breakfast coupons, an eager to please staff. They even have pets--we got a goldfish for our stay--for families looking for something a bit more. There were a few--very few--rough spots. The hotel could use more people at the front door given that the doors are awfully heavy, especially if one's arms are full of luggage. The windows really need to be double paned--Charles Street is a busy, loud street and the single paned windows let in most of the noise. Some of the suites are poorly designed for families--the one we stayed in the second night required kids to troupe past the parents' bed to use the bathroom.

Really??!!\u201d", "Author": "free2behappy05", "ReviewID": "UR54447890", "Content": "I planned a beautiful weekend for my boyfriend's birthday in November at the Hotel Monaco in Baltimore because it looked lovely on the website. I was very excited because it was the first time I had done something this nice for anyone, and me and my boyfriend were getting very serious at this time in our relationship. Upon arrival, we were not aware of the valet service or the check-in process period. So we pull up in my '04 Chevy, and the valet drivers just ignored us, and proceeded to serve the Lexus truck parked in front of us. Noticing the process, I had to get out of the car, go to the inconspicuous front desk to check in (it was on the second floor and I didn't know because NO ONE told me what to do or where to go), get my room key, and then tell the valet drivers \"Hey...we're staying here.\" Once they realized we were guests, they were very helpful, and getting to the room was a breeze. STRIKE 1: Once to the room, there were dishes in front of our door from previous guests. The bell hop told us that it would be taken care of \"probably later on tonight.\" OK no big deal. Later, I checked my bank account because I had reserved an expensive dinner that same night; just wanted to be sure that I could cover it. Unbeknown to me, because I used my debit card, the hotel charged me for two nights, two days of valet ($35/day), and incidental fee of quite a bit of money totaling: over $500...leaving my account unable to pay for the dinner. Now, I was under the impression that my card was to confirm my reservation and I would pay at the end; regardless of what I \"thought\", it sure would've been nice to know how the money process works when using a debit card vs. a credit card. The woman at the front desk did not tell me anything. My boyfriend ended up having to pay for his birthday dinner, and every meal we ate during that weekend. I had never been so embarrassed in my life. STRIKE 2: Since we were guests in the hotel, we figured that dinner in the hotel restaurant would be our best bet. LITTLE DID WE KNOW, the restaurant works on a reservation process...meaning if you don't have a reservation, you're probably gonna have to wait forever or eat at a awkward table with strangers. We ended up eating with strangers that night which ended up being a pretty nice experience, but not one we were planning to have. For the over $500 they took from my account without telling me, I personally feel that priority should be given to hotel guests at the restaurant. STRIKE 3: We went to breakfast around 9:00 the next morning leaving the \"PLEASE SERVICE\" sign on the door. When we went to breakfast, which was included in the room fees, I presented the little tickets which entitles us to the continental breakfast to the waiter downstairs. He was very polite, and informed us that we could sit anywhere in the restaurant we wanted, as he pointed upstairs. We went ahead upstairs, since we ate downstairs the night before. We made our plates, sat down and began eating when another waiter came up to us and asked us to present our tickets yet again. Of course I didn't have it anymore because I had given it to the waiter downstairs. It was quite an insult to see this waiter go downstairs and verify that we indeed had tickets and weren't just moochers. Just a little side note, not only did we eat the included continental breakfast, we ordered ACTUAL BREAKFAST too. STRIKE 4: When we got back to our room about two hours later, our room had not been serviced. This was not a big deal to us so we left the service sign up, and would just move out of the way once the cleaning staff arrived. It wasn't until it was dark outside and we were out of clean towels that we became irritated. We called the service line to tell them about the service/towels, and oh by the way...the dishes still sitting outside of our room. 2 hours later, we received towels. After dinner that night (around 9:00 or so), the dishes finally were picked up by a staff member who looked like he was the only one servicing all of the rooms. (We had seen him on other floors when we went for a walk around the hotel earlier that day) STRIKE 5: The final day, we got our things together, and prepared for breakfast and checkout. Since my boyfriend needed cash, we decided that I would go pick up the breakfast tickets while he got the cash, and we would meet up at the restaurant for breakfast. After I got the tickets, I went downstairs and was approached by one of the young men who works the front door. He said VERBATIM, \"DAMN...What's Yo name??\" Shocked and a little scared, I said my name and that I was here with my boyfriend. He said he didn't care, and continued to hassle me. I literally had to run and hide in the restaurant for him to leave me alone. THE RESOLUTION: Once we got to the front desk to check out, the concierge asked us how our stay was. We looked at each other and said, \"Where do we begin?!\" I told the concierge EVERYTHING. He listened to me intently, and was pretty shocked about how we were treated. He wrote down everything, and resolved to refund me the full amount of our stay only charging us for taxes and miscellaneous charges which totaled $81 total. This was a great resolution for our stay and I was pleases with the outcome. I took my boyfriend shopping with the money instead, but it was not what I originally planned. THE AFTERSHOCK: I checked my account to ensure that the hotel actually did refund me. To my surprise, the hotel reactivated my parking fee and took out an extra day of parking ($35) the next day! I had to call management to have them deactivate it and give me my money back. All in all, the hotel is beautiful...ABSOLUTELY gorgeous. Almost breathtaking; but the service trumps all of that beauty. I have told all of my friends and co-workers about this, and told them to never stay there.

We were on the 12th floor and found it very quiet in the evening, not bad considering the hotel seemed pretty full for New Year's. Valet Parking is the only option at the hotel for $36 a night. There is a parking garage one block up on the left and it was only $21 a night. If we include the tip for valet, I probably saved $40 for the two nights by just walking one block. Be careful when pulling up to the hotel because there is no pull out from Charles Street. Curbside is the only option for unloading. As stated earlier the Harbor is an easy walk and we did it on a snowy, cold morning. The restaurant/bar in the hotel is called B&O American Brasserie and we ate a quality dinner in there. It also has a modern theme, but moderately expensive if one is just looking for a quick bite. However, the smaller brick oven pizzas are excellent for only $9. The Caribou Coffee Cafe across the street was also a nice place to stop for some java. As stated earlier the Harbor is an easy walk and we did it on a snowy, cold morning. I highly recommend this hotel for a great stay in Baltimore.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bowie, MD", "Title": "\u201cGorgeous hotel but does not live up to the Kimpton hype\u201d", "Author": "TravelMom_Bowie", "ReviewID": "UR52397499", "Content": "The location and interior of this hotel are magnificent.

That's a long wait. 2 - Ensure staff are knowledgeable about hotel packages. I booked a package that was advertised on the Kimpton site and saw posters for in the hotel's lobby, but no one on the staff at the time of check-in seemed familiar with it and seemed to bumble over themselves trying to figure it out. Even upon check-out, we were not provided all the credits proffered in the package and had to have the hotel's manager fix the mistake. 3 - The in room dining menu left a lot to be desired and was very expensive. While we would have preferred to stay in the hotel for dinner, we decided to head out because of the limited menu. For breakfast, we ordered 1 omelette, 1 waffle, 1 pot of coffee, and it cost us over $50! The service fees and delivery fees were extraordinary and not necessarily disclosed prior to ordering.

There are certainly plenty of hotels in the neighborhood -- Baltimore's somewhat seedy and downtrodden business district though it's an easy walk to the Inner Harbor -- but I'd stayed at a couple of Hotel Monacos in San Francisco and Salt Lake City so thought I'd give it a try. You know when you walk into a hotel, all stressed and disheveled, and you walk out, some 15 hours later, and feel like you've been transformed into a calm, centered normal person? That's how I felt. It was just a splendid, if way too short, stay and I'll go back (and might even start checking out more of this chain since there are now East Coast properties). Check in was superb -- request for bathroom with tub was honored though the room rate I booked apparently was shower only. Hotel is just beautiful; Kimpton, its owner, has taken the gorgeous old headquarters of the B&O Railroad and given it a warm, contemporary yet lushly traditional (hard combo to achieve!) feel. The hotel by the way is tucked inside what's still a commercial office building. Loved the color schemes in my room (a cerulean blue put me in better spirits immediately upon entering) and here's a little detail but it's symbolic of what Kimpton does right: Inside the closet, the walls are painted a matching blue. It's a small thing but ... it works. Loved the whimiscal room snacks (for a fee, no problem), the soft zebra-patterned bathrobes, Aveda toiletries, the free Internet if you sign up for Kimpton's loyalty club (my pleasure), the general spaciousness of the room, and the ultra-comfy bed. I don't remember too much more -- it was a very short stay. There is a hip looking restaurant on the ground floor and I was too late arriving for a meal the night before and had to leave just before lunch so no time there, either, but the menu looked just fine and loved the ambience. The only thing I'm not crazy about, and this might not be relevant to most, is the neighborhood's a little dicey. I'm a native Baltimorean and so I know how to get around -- but I really like areas like Johns Hopkins Homewood, Mt. Vernon and Fells Point and even Federal Hill (which all have hotels) because there's life there. At night, here, not so much. And even the nearby Harborplace, wow, the economy has taken a huge toll on that once-beloved place. Empty and soulless....

The location is not as good as the other true Inner Harbor hotels, although it is definitely walkable. The building itself is beautiful as the former headquarters of the B & O railroad. Even if you aren't staying here, if you happen to be walking by you owe it to yourself to stop in the lobby to see the magnificent Tiffany stained glass ceiling. As with any opening, there are bound to be a few glitches, and the Hotel Monaco was no different. I was greeted by several doormen, who all seemed excited to have guests and eager to help. I dropped off my bags and took the rental car two blocks north to a garage that charges $6 /day weekend rate (222 N Charles I believe). Valet is steep at $36 per day, so check out the other options. The receptionist was still learning the system and it took a few minutes to apply my Kimpton InTouch membership to my stay. Understandable. I was then escorted to my room by one of the bellmen who took my bags. I was assigned room 1406, on the top floor as I requested. We got off the elevator and the bellman took me to the wrong end of the hallway before realizing he had gone the wrong way. Honest mistake as he was still learning his way around I guess. We went back the other way and found the room. He then came in and began explaining the features of the room as one would expect. After he was done explaining the finer points of the bathroom, he then pointed me to the FOURTEEN inch flat screen TV (no, I didn't mishear him as he said it twice). In actuality, it was a nice LG 40\"+ LCD. This was clearly a direct result of the training this gentleman received, and I hope they had this straightened out soon thereafter. The room was very nice....typical Kimpton style and very large (my queen queen room was over 400 sqft!). I particularly fancied the leather wallpaper in the bathroom. I have only two other minor quibbles, the first being that my rate included a nightly cocktail in B&O, the hotel restaurant, but the hotel had not received the vouchers from corporate yet, so I did not receive my cocktail. When I checked in, I mentioned this and they offered to escort me to the bar right then, but I was late to a dinner reservation so I declined. The only other comment I have is I did not receive my InTouch welcome amenity $10 minibar coupon, which I assume is also attributable to opening night kinks. I understand one cannot accurately judge a hotel by it's performance on opening night, and I will be back next week to see how much the staff has grown in 5 short months.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Monmouth Junction, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAnother Fantastic Kimpton\u201d", "Author": "Case1096", "ReviewID": "UR51049302", "Content": "The Baltimore Monaco proves itself as another wonderful Kimpton property.

When Laurelle, the wonderful concierge, went up to put the wine in the room, she noticed that the room was a little warm and offered to upgrade me yet again to a suite, which was extremely kind. Later, I mentioned to her that it was my birthday and that my family and I were going out to celebrate, and I found a bottle of champagne and a personalized note in my room upon my return. The wine hour was very classy, with pleasant conversation and very decent wine freely flowing. We missed the milk and cookie hour, but again, Laurelle came through and made sure that she put some aside for my family. In fact, she was so giving that I felt guilty.

The 'amenity' of internet access in the Business Center will cost you $6.95 for 15 minutes! As for bath products, I have never stayed in any hotel that did not have shampoo, condtioner and a shower cap (sometimes even body lotion). You get a bar of soap, that is it! They will tell you that these things are available if you ask (some at a charge) but again why all the asking? There isn't even a phone book in the room and the lobby has none of the pamphlets and folders of different activities and restaurants that most hotels in any location have. Everything is about asking the front desk. Another guest I met in the elevator also commented on the strangeness of it; sometimes it is just easier to look things up yourself. However, as I said the staff is wonderful which made my stay pleasant enough. Oh and by the way, do youself a favor at breakfast - go around the corner to the Radisson Lord Baltimore restaurant. They have a great $9.95 breakfast buffet which includes juice and coffee.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northeast, US", "Title": "\u201cA jewel in downtown Baltimore.\u201d", "Author": "lawgod", "ReviewID": "UR46583951", "Content": "We needed a hotel while running in the Baltimore Running Festival.

The restaurant/bar is very nice, the staff is great and also the food.

At 3.40pm we arrive to the hotel for our bags and the closet were they put them was closed and the staff didn\u00b4t find who has the key. At that point I was very angry with the staff hotel finally 15 minutes later they found the key and gave us the bags, we didn\u00b4t miss the train because the train arrived late from Wash.

In fact, it is a reason to go for a visit in-and-of itself (when you don't want to mingle with the Baltimore riff-raff). I admit it, I'm not the biggest fan of Baltimore, I knew it had its heyday but I had never seen much of the glitz, just more just of Camden Yards and the Inner Harbor. So when my partner and I headed there to celebrate the one year anniversary of our wedding, (which is where we had one of our first dates) I had visions of Hyatt's and Marriotts in my head and their boxy architecture and sufficient service (you know the kind where your stay isn't an experience unless it is a bad one). So I was ready to be really picky. I couldn't help but be impressed, and I'm usually not. So because I write so few good reviews, I wanted to make a list: Location: Literally 4 blocks to anywhere of any interest in Baltimore (down the hill to Inner Harbor, up the hill to Mt. Vernon, over to the Convention Center). Despite my fear of anyone who even looks like they are from Baltimore, we walked everywhere, and only had to take a cab twice (when we went to dinner at Charleston). The building: Wow, looks like the Plaza in NYC, one of the most beauiful buildings in Baltimore or any city. The lobby, is one enormous marble and stained glass antique, so tred lightly. I am a sucker for immaculately preserved buidlings from America's industrial heyday (we just don't build beauty now like we did). Curb Service: I can usually carry my own bags, but they guy with the Humphrey Bogart hat was so friendly, and I'm a sucker for good fashion, so that was that. We were whisked in, which gave us the feeling of being quickly rushed past the coach passengers to first class, so that feeling of superiority immediately put me in a good mood. Lobby: The reception is on the 2nd floor, and rocks it out. You thought the W was posh, this is how you'd decorate if you wanted to show off, but still wanted it to be comfortable enough to let your inner rock star party a bit...Um did I mention lots of free wine. So, we thought about having a glass before we even checked-in... I'm sure that would have been okay, the place just has that vibe. Check-in: To the point, and friendly. They even have a Train with toys for kids (not that I really care for kids, unless they are entirely silent and serve some purpose, but its a nice little idea). The Room: Wow, Wow. I cannot say enough. Flat screen, comfy bed, very quiet, turn-down service, champagne (on-ice) and chocolate covered stawberries, and a 4ft deep two person jacuzzi tub. (one nit: some instructions on how to operate the tub would be great, we figured it out though, and I'm sure we coulda called too and someone would have told us). We could have stayed in the room the whole time. Checkout: It was a bit crowded when we went to check-out on Sunday, but most of that was due to some irresponsible woman with 5 offspring who sounded like 20 (I guess its hard to screen for that without barring children all-together). A bell hop was on it though, and I was actually impressed while he distracted them with the toy train so the front desk could get her checked out. Price: So I love to live it up, but the inner-midwesterner kicks in and I need to get a deal. This hotel was SOOOO worth every penny, and I didn't even realize what a deal we got until we got there. We got upgraded so we definitely got more than we paid for, but even then the price was about the same as Marriott and the Hyatt. I can't think of what else to say. The Hotel Monaco made our experience.

Great location downtown Baltimore with nice views of the other skyline buildings. Valet parking is expensive 36$/day and nearby garages run about 10-15$/day over the weekends. Also, as a negative I should mention the \"free breakfast\" is a bit of a joke if you got it in the package, since it includes only coffee/tea, pastries and fruits, but if you want eggs, you have to order off the menu. I am not clear why they played this little cheap thing as a welcoming package since it's not really a pleasure to find this out when you go there. A big plus, however, the B&O restaurant in the hotel have amaizing dinners; the chef makes some of the most delicious meals I had; we tried the beef and chicken and can tell you that different flavors just melt in your mouth; a definitely must if you plan to dine in the area....Otherwise, rooms are a bit small and the A/C seems quite noisy when it runs.
