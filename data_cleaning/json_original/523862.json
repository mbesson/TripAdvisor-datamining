They have individually wrapped danishes and some nice bagels but no juice or fruit. The climate control had a loud fan but it was more like white noise to us. It helped so you didn't hear noise from other people in the building. We only stayed in a one bedroom and really wished it had a couch or more comfortable seating.

Be advised there are two kinds of \"Deluxe 1 Bedroom\". One has a full kitchen, washer/dryer, large master suite/bathroom, living room (w/ sleeper sofa), dining area. The other has a bedroom, living room (w/sleeper sofa), but only a limited kitchen (small \"bar\" refridgerator and microwave), but no other cooking facilities, and no washer/dryer. The two bedroom is these two combined - so LOTS of space to spread out. The resort is basically a quad of 3-story buildings surrounding the pool area (several pools in a nice setting). There is an exercise room and a spa (extra $ for spa services). There were no resort activities the week we were there, but that may have been because it was the end of January (pretty quite time of the year). They do provide pastries and coffee for breakfast if you don't have your own. If you don't have a car on your trip, you COULD survive without one. The nearest casino (The Orleans) is less than a half mile away (not sure I would walk it at midnight) that has several different restaurants in addition to the ubiquitous buffet. There is a shuttle to The Orleans, as well as shuttles to either end of the Strip (New York New York or the Mirage). There is a grocery store shuttle 3 x /week. The property is located adjacent to a strip mall with some eating establishments (Denny's, Starbucks, Q'doba, Quiznos, etc). Walgreens (with some food items) is in that strip mall, and a large gas station convenience store across the street from Walgreens. HOWEVER, the advertised \"wi-fi available\" is a total rip-off. Yes, I expect to pay for internet at vacation resorts (after all, the time share owners would have their dues increased if there was free internet), but I DON'T expect to pay $50.95 for 7 days, and for EACH wireless device!! Other vacation resort internet services provide a code to use for other wireless devices once you pay once. I'm even OK using only 1 device at a time, but there is NO way to use your $51 worth of internet on any other device. The company phone number doesn't answer, the tech support never connected to a live person, and the front desk claimed they had no way to get you a code (even though there is a spot to enter a code instead of buying service, and you can get internet for only $10 a week if you take the 90 minute resort sales tour pitch - so there IS a way to get a code if the resort wanted to!!). Oh, and once you whine to the front desk, THEN they mention that there is free wireless in the lobby (but they have to enter the password onto your device themselves). Or, you could walk just over to the Starbucks and use their free wi-fi.", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Easton, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cHad to ask for change of room....\u201d", "Author": "P O", "ReviewID": "UR123120244", "Content": "Be careful staying here...I just returned from 2 weeks in Vegas and one of the weeks I spent staying at tahiti vacation club (the other week was at tahiti village on las vegas drive). Lobby and staff seemed nice upon check-in, but the room I was initially given can only be described as gross. I should have never unpacked, but I was in a hurry to make an business appointment (trade show booth set-up) that afternoon. The room had a terrible strong musty smell, stained sheets and stained bedspread, cigarette burns in carpet and unknown things (im praying they were some type of seed and not insect eggs) that were spread all around the room. I returned home much later that night with lysol air freshner to help with the smell in hand, and i reluctantly spent the night in that room. In the morning, I found the seeds/eggs on the floor and the stains on the cover and sheets and I immediately requested a change of room. Initially I was denied and was simply told the resort was full. The staff at that time offered no response, no questions and no concern at all for my reasons for wanting to switch rooms. I was simply told to try back later. I came back to the hotel mid-day, spoke to a different front desk staff and was then indeed given a different room. This room, though the same size, was in a different building and was much better. I was relieved and immediately moved into that room for the remainder of my stay. After the switch, I returned to the front desk to return the cards to my initial room and was then dismayed when I was told I was \"lucky\" and that I should not have been given the other room. Had I been told to stay in the first room, on this review I would have posted the pics I took of the first room and warned all on here to avoid this place. However apparently I was \"lucky\", and since I was given then second room and seeing as how I had no problems or complaints of that second room that I was given, i feel an average rating seems correct.

We bought a week in a two bedroom unit about 5 years ago. And have used it every year. We have even split the time up and done a one bedroom unit in April one year and then the other one bedroom unit in the fallowing August. I am so glad we purchased here. It's so laid back and not busy. I have stayed a couple times on the strip and even though its nice being right there it is still crazy. So being a couple miles up on Tropicana is nice. They have shuttles that run you to the strip as well. We almost always rent a car when we are down there though cause we have friends out in Henderson we go and visit. But the staff is always nice and friendly. Everything is always clean looking. Plus even though its one of the older timeshares it doesn't look dated and it doesn't smell of cigeratte smoke. The two pools are great as well as the hottub. Both pools have a small sand bottom area at one end of them for the kids to play in. I love that the pools are open 24 hours as well cause we get back late some nights and we can still go for a swim and relax in the hot tub before going to bed. The rooms are so specious, the bedrooms are the size of a regular hotel room but the bathrooms are full size with a jetted tubs. There is his and hers sinks in the master bedroom and a closet with full length mirror doors in both rooms. But on top of the specious rooms there is a living room, dinning table, and full size kitchen with fridge, stove, oven, full size microwave, and a set of dishes and cooking wear along with a dishwasher. Then to top it off they have one of those half washer/dryer units in the closet with the hot water tank. So you don't have to take a tone of clothes on vacation. Since those baggage fees are out of control these days. They also have a fireplace but we have never had to use it. It does look nice though. I also love the fact that the drapes are really heavy so no light gets in when they are closed. Great when you are sleeping in tell noon. Almost every time we have stayed there we have had a pool view as well. I think the only thing I don't like about this place is you can't have pets at all. But thats not world ending cause I have friends and family that can watch our little dog while we are gone for a week. Also its a great place for a family vacation even though its usually just me and my husband that go either alone or with friends. They also have barbeques out by the pool for guests to use as well. Plus they hand out coupons and you can purchase discount tickets to area attractions and shows. So over all I recommend this place to anyone going to vegas.", "Date": "June 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roswell, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cGood value and convenient\u201d", "Author": "wg355", "ReviewID": "UR113327473", "Content": "First time that I stayed off the strip.

We dont really like staying in casinos and needed a place close to the Orleans - Tahiti was it! It is a couple minute drive, or about a 10-15 minute casual walk a couple lights East on Tropicana. We arrived at Tahiti earlier than the stated check-in time (4pm) and they had us checked into our room immediately (3rd floor, pool view at the end of the hallway). Due to our budget constraints due to the event this year, we booked the Jr Studio room - which was perfect for us! The bathroom was a good size with a single vanity and a heavenly jacuzzi bathtub! The room was very open for being a studio room so that my boyfriend and I had no trouble getting ready or preparing meals. The kitchenette is decent - sink, dishes (plates, bowls, cups, coffee cups, utensils, etc), small microwave, toaster,coffee-maker and small fridge (practically no freezer space, but held our food and drinks perfectly fine). We used the BBQ grills by the pool to cook dinner one night (there are three grills). As others have mentioned, since Tahiti is part time share your room doesn't get regular housecleaning like you experience in a standard hotel. We were only there a few nights so we didn't need to request any new towels or sheets. Unlike the One and Two-Bedroom suites, the studio suite does not have a fireplace, washer/dryer, full kitchen (full-size fridge, oven/stove, etc), and patio/balcony. The pool area looked pretty relaxing, however we weren't really able to utilize it due to my need to be at the Orleans for modeling jobs during the day. I was able to check them out briefly though. There are two pools (the beach entry pool with real sand was heated, the other was not), a rock feature water fountain, and a jacuzzi with a rock waterfall into it. The grounds were kept clean and the parking was decent. Tahiti does not offer free internet - I think it was something like $10 a day so we did without it. We utilized the hotel's free shuttle a few times to get to the Orleans. The shuttle was timely, the driver was friendly, and the ride was only a couple minutes to get to the first stop). There is a shopping center just next door to the hotel with a Starbucks, restaurants, grocery store, etc. so it is very convenient. Being a time share location we were worried about having to sit through the sales pitch but it was never once brought up to us...thank goodness!

The rooms were well appointed with kitchen including dishwasher, microwave, big cooker, washing machine, tumble drier etc - so it would be an excellent option if you wanted to stay a week or more in Vegas.

Next door there is a retail park with supermarket and various restaurants and take-aways including Dennys, Pizza, Mexican Chinese & Japanese. One thing to be aware of - this place is not strictly a hotel. It seems to be some kind of time-share venture.

We were assigned Room # 219, 2nd floor, West view, overlooking parking lot and next door apartments. We arrived early (noon), but a room wasn't available until 3pm. We were asked if we wanted to attend a timeshare presentation for Tahiti Village (new resort), but we declined. They didn't push at all. In fact, the timeshare folks in and around the strip resorts are MUCH more annoying and aggresive. Our suite was extremely clean and fully stocked. We grocery shopped for all of our breakfast foods (grocery was close) and ate only that meal in our suite each day. All other meals at restaurants. The kitchen had EVERYTHING you would need to do even the most adventurous cooking. Full size coffee maker was a plus. We visited the continental breakfast (very basic) offered each morning, and picked up a few danishes too. We visited the pool each day, because the weather was perfect! There were no kids at the resort when we were there (hurray!). The pool was dead quiet, and this is exactly as we like it. Folks were around and in the pool, but there was no noise. One pool was heated and could be used for swimming. The HOT hot tub was great. We enjoyed the sun and read books. We had a rental car (I would recommend this to everyone for a week's stay), but the shuttle was always around. We took the Red Rock Canyon bus tour offered by the resort. 3 hours and very informative. $2 per person, can't even drive it for that $. The king beds were very comfortable, including 4 pillows per bed. The blackout curtains were terrific, and the windows were operable so that we could get some fresh air. The bathrooms were great, fully stocked and great water temp and pressure. Plenty of towels, including 2 huge pool towels per bedroom. Take them to the pool, and remember to bring them back to your suite. Watched ESPN Sports Center a few times during the stay, so the TV was just fine too. We had housekeeping services just once during the stay. They restocked everything. Be careful! They come early, so if you want to sleep in, use the PRIVACY door hanger! Overall, I would stay this resort had everything we want, including the critical \"QUIET\" we desired. Do not stay here if you want a rocking resort with lots of noise, eye candy and constant activites. This is a great place to retreat from the business of the strip when you have had enough.

To be honest, I am really hesitant to write this review because I love it so much that I want to make sure that I can get in here the next time I come to Vegas. I'm here when there are three big, big tradeshows in town and I booked this place because I didn't care if I was on the Strip or not. I just wanted a decent place for a decent price. I got that and a whole lot more. I can't stop telling people how much I love this place. OK, it's basically a small timeshare type place. But there is no pressure tactics here. No worries about that. Check in was quick and friendly. I got the one-bedroom, not the lockout. I am really glad I did. I got a lot more space and it wasn't that much to upgrade. It's basically like a one-bedroom apartment. You open the front door and there is a little kitchen off to the side. It has granite counters, a full refridgerator, stove and open, microwave and dishwasher. It comes full stocked with plates, glasses, etc. There is a small dining table and 4 chairs and extending into the living area, a couch and upholstered chair, coffee table, armoire with TV, stereo and DVD player and a gas fireplace. There's also a slider door to the balcony with 2 chairs and a small table. My unit overlooks the pool area. The bedroom is large and has a king, with another TV armoire. The bathroom has double sinks, granite counters like in the kitchen and a jaccuzi tub that came in very handy after a long day on a trade show floor! Finally, there is a stackable washer/dryer in the hall closet. The resort has three smaller pools and a hot tub. The landscaping is nice, palm trees everywhere. There are grills so you can even grill by the pool. The lobby is decorated beautifully. They even run a shuttle to the Strip if you feel like walking around down there and you don't have a car. There's a concierge who will give you coupons and things like that. I can't even begin to imagine paying $400 a night for a room on the Strip anymore. The location is on West Tropicana. There's an Albertson's about a half mile from here so you can get provisions. I am definitely going to come back here the next time I come back to Vegas.

The hotel is located about a mile away from the Strip, which is a good thing in my opinion. The hotel offers a shuttle service, but I didn't use it. I would recommend renting a car and driving yourself to the strip. The hotel is very clean, and nice looking. Has a nice south Pacific Tiki look to it. The hotel offers parking which is gated after 11pm. The building is under 24 hour security, and is kept free of riff raff. When we checked in, we did not receive a parking pass, nor were we told about such a thing. I parked the car, and received a warning ticket on the windshield that they were going to tow my car if I didn't have a parking pass. A quick trip to the desk took care of this. The room was like a mini studio apartment. Granite counters, mini fridge, full set of dishes, cutting board, iron. There is no housekeeping for guests that stay less than 7 days. We stayed 4 days, and ended up hunting down housekeeping people to see if we could exchange dirty towels for clean ones. For guests that stayed less than 7 days, we could schedule a housekeeping service for $25 dollars per day. No thanks, how cheesy is that. The bathroom has a jacuzzi tub, and a sliding glass shower, with terracotta tiles. Very nice and clean unit. Too bad there was no hot water. Just tepid barely warm water. Not much fun taking a cool shower, or jacuzzi tub. People usually expect hot water in showers at hotels. I pulled out my laptop in the hotel room to get some instructions for my day trip. Their WIFI is 9.99 per day, or 39.99 for the week. Again, no thanks. Later that day, I grabbed a couple of beach towels, and noticed a note about \"towel inventory\", and how there would be a \"$35 dollar charge per towel\" if all towels weren't returned. Again, how cheesy is that? The pool and hot tub area is very nice and clean. We found it to be pretty empty, not many guests there. The 2 pools are heated, and there is a hot tub with a waterfall. The pools also have a sand bottom entrance . Very nice. Next to the pool area is a grill area, where I assume guests can do some grilling. It seemed pretty nice, but I didn't use it. There is an Albertson's Grocery store about a block east of the hotel on Tropicana. We stocked up on snacks and some food and drinks there.

Had absolutely no problems with the staff. Everyone was very friendly. My one complaint is that they did not pick up the trash regularly. But when I called the front desk , it was picked up immediately. I exchanged into this resort through Interval International as I am a timeshare owner. Some people complain about timeshares, but it is a great deal if you like to travel. My friends were able to come to Vegas with me for just the cost of airfare. The timeshare deals offered at Tahiti were very good, so good that my friend bought one at Tahiti. She and her boyfriend loved it there. I would have bought there too if I didn\u2019t already own one. As a guest, we received lots of discounts to attractions and shows and restaurants, and nightclubs, which we used. Because my friend bought a timeshare, we received free show tickets for all of us to see Matsuri, and $75.00 dinner discount at Gallagher\u2019s Steak House, plus $25.00 off at Tahiti Joes at Tahiti Village. The timeshare presentation was low key and was held on the resort premises. We did not have to go off the resort. No one harassed us to attend. We were called once and agreed to go because of the free show tickets, but like I said the deals were very good so my friend bought one. She was planning to buy anyway as she knew the advantages of owning because of my ownership. The resort is small, and a sister property to the larger and still under construction, Tahiti Village. The resort is immaculate. There are two pools, a water fall section and a large Jacuzzi with a waterfall. They also have barbeque grills by the pool area so guests can cook out. The setting is very tropical with palm trees, and light music. We enjoyed the pools very much as they were never crowded and the pools are open 24 hours. There is no gym on the resort, but they give free passes to a large fitness center right next door. You can go as many times as you like. The resort is next door to a mini mall, with several restaurants and other stores, which is very convenient. There is a Denny\u2019s there too which had horrible food. The Mexican restaurant was excellent. The resort has a shuttle bus that goes on a morning grocery run to a large grocery store named Albertson\u2019s. It\u2019s kind of expensive, but convenient. The shuttle also runs every hour to the Strip which was also very convenient. The resort is not very far from the strip. One night the shuttle was 30 minutes late and the front desk said to take a taxi to the strip, get a receipt and they would reimburse us. We went to Mandalay Bay which cost $10.00. The next day the resort reimbursed us the cab fare with no problem in cash. The resort also offers excursions to various sights in Vegas. We went on the Red Rock Canyon tour, but it rained that day and they cancelled the tour due to flooding (weird, flooding in the desert). Of course, they reimbursed us the $2.00 fee. The trip was part of the free offerings for guests at Tahiti. The fee was for the Red Rock Canyon conservation company. We were disappointed because of the rain. Everyone was saying it had not rained in Vegas for six months! But they offer other tours and show tours with discounts and round trip transportation. We also went on the Fremont Street Experience tour through the resort which was also free with round trip transportation from the resort. This was fun too, and we stayed downtown and did not come back with the tour, but rather took a bus to the strip and stayed on the strip all night. We stayed in a two bedroom condo which consists of a large one bedroom with living room, kitchen , bathroom with whirlpool bath and a lock off section which was like a large studio with kitchenette and large whirlpool bath in the bathroom. The condo was immaculate. The living room has a fireplace with a balcony. The kitchen and bath have granite countertops. The kitchen is a full kitchen with dishwasher, all pots and pans and dishes and utensils. There is a washer/dryer combo in the main section of the condo, lots of space and plenty of towels. The tropical theme is repeated throughout the condo as the decorations seem to be custom designed with bamboo light fixtures, and palm tree prints on the furniture fabrics. It was all understated and very comfortable. There were televisions with music systems in the living room, and bedrooms. If you are staying here and you are not getting the complete 2 bedroom condo, make sure you do get the side with the full kitchen and not the lock off. The lock off is nice too, but it is much smaller than the side with the living room and kitchen. People mistakenly think the lock off is the standard accommodation, but it is not. It is just an extension of the much bigger one bedroom condo with full kitchen. Of course, the lock off is probably cheaper to get if money is an issue. But if you like space and all the comforts of home, get the larger size. This is not a Comfort Inn.

We were downstairs on time, but no one was greeting us. 15 minutes later we had to find someone to ask about it and they told it the presentation would be at another property, so they would call a cab, but that our 2 hours was already begun. They told us they would pay for it, but when we get to the other site, no one was there to pay the cabbie, so I had to pay him and try to get my money back later. Finally, from that point, we were back to the normal time-share games. But when all done, we wrapped up with the rudest salesman we have deal with and out 4 hours of our time. 4. GET OUT!!! While the reservations said check-out time was 11 a.m., upon check-in we are told it is 10 a.m. and if you don't check out on time they will double bill you for the final day. At 9 a.m., we were bluntly asked by the maid when we would be leaving and she then proceeded to - literally - sit outside our door and wait for us to leave.", "Date": "July 9, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cHad fun at the Tahiti\u201d", "Author": "Angibabyrn", "ReviewID": "UR7190635", "Content": "My friends parents own a time share here so staying here we got an incredible deal (paid her parents for use so they set the price they charged us). There was four of us girls who stayed for 4 nights. We reserved a two bedroom condo. I was very surprised at the accomidations that we recieved. The condo was a pool view with a cute little balcony on the third floor. The condo was very spacious. We had a full kitchen with granite countertops and would have been very lovely to have cooked there if we would have wanted to do that. We did run to Albertson's down the street to get some drinks and snack items but didnt cook much of anything. There was a small dining room table, a full living room with a fireplace. Each bedroom had very comfy king size beds, it's own private bathroom with a huge tub/shower combo. One bedroom had a small \"kitchenette\" as it would have been a stand alone \"lock out room\" if you only wanted to rent for a smaller party. There was a washer and dryer in the main part of the condo. The bedroom had very effective black out curtains. Great for after a late night!!! The pool area was very nice with a hot tub. On a previous stay to Vegas I stayed in downtown on Freemont. While I liked being closer to action it was very nice to get away from the constant music that is played in that area and the lights of the strip. We like to party but getting back to the quiet room when we wanted to was very nice. The area is less than a 10 dollar ride in a cab from the stip and very quick to drive.", "Date": "March 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cGood value for the seasoned traveller\u201d", "Author": "u003558", "ReviewID": "UR7154566", "Content": "Located less than 2 miles from the strip, but with easy access to I15 and airport.

So many little things prompt me to write. It's the little things that matter to some travelers, so while they are fresh in my mind, here they are: 1. \"Equipped exercise room\" is advertised on the Consolidated Resorts web site as well as the Tahiti guide book in every room. There is no exercise room. I asked the front desk clerk for directions and found this out. He gave me a pass for the 24 hour fitness club next door and said it is valid for a week. That's all well and good, but it's Tuesday, and I should have received this on Saturday upon check in. 2. Concierge: My past experience with concierge service is excellent. The Tahiti is an exception. Inside the room are guidebooks of Las Vegas with coupons for a variety of events. The concierge cannot contact these places and obtain the same discounts. It's unfortunate because a concierge at a time share should be able to get the best price. One of the events was at The Comedy Stop at the Tropicana (based on online reviews comedy is good, and price includes a drink). The concierge instead recommended the comedy at the Riviera because it was only 11.95 and I could \"buy the tickets right upstairs.\" No thanks. Same went for a magic show - she couldn't call and get the same discount. No maps of the area either. She pointed us to the Walgreens next door where they are sold for $4.95. 3. Housekeeping is clean. They clean once a week (Tuesday). They came by at 9 and I asked that they return at 12 when we would be at an event. Instead, someone else returned at 10:30. This could have been a language barrier issue. I asked her to return in 10 minutes and we left the room so she could clean. When we returned an hour later, the maid was further down the hall from our room and sitting on the hallway floor. I've never seen a housekeeper sitting on the hallway floor. Ever. 4. Sunday's \"Waffles with the Concierge\" event on the Consolidated Resorts web site consists of waffles you toast yourself. During the rest of the week, there is no station of fresh fruit available (unless you listen to the time share sales). 5. Transportation shuttle to the strip is good. Drivers very friendly and on time. I would recommend an airport shuttle to the management. 6. Rooms are spacious and clean. There is a very home-like atmosphere. Grounds are well-kept, and security seems to be above par. All in all, I would not recommend this place to someone who wants the fun accessible at all times. For that, stay closer to the strip. This resort is about 2 and a half miles away which is walkable, but definitely not at night time. Concierge leaves much to be desired as I feel they did not go the extra mile. Either schedule your shows and events based on the Tahiti's transportation schedule or prepare for a $15 cab ride ($11.00 plus tip) each way to the strip.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Killeen, TX", "Title": "\u201cGood, but not Fantastic\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5336268", "Content": "We just returned from the Tahiti.
