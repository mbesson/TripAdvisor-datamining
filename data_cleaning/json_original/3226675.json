Hotel was really nice, new, and clean. The outdoor pool was great. Plenty of places to relax. You sign at the desk for beach towels.

They need to get better toasters. I would have to say, they were the slowest toasters I've ever used. Staff was friendly and helpful. We booked a studio suite. It was very roomy. The only complaint about the room was the shower head. It was the worst shower. They really need to do something about that. Over all, great place, good location.

No regrets about this hotel. Even though it is not on the beach it\u2019s a short block away and wasn\u2019t difficult crossing the busy street. Plenty of eating and drinking establishments within walking distance and the view of the bay was very relaxing while sitting on the balcony. Almost everyone I encountered from the housekeeping staff, maintenance workers, breakfast attendant were all very personable and eager to please. One young man in particular, Greg, went out of his way to find me a box of tissues when he heard my friends and I talking that I forgot to grab one before I left the room. He also brought two chairs up for us to sit on the patio since there were 4 of us in the room. One person that was not very helpful was the front desk clerk Mary. As your first point of contact when you check in, you would think she would be informed of the policies of the hotel and especially Hilton Honor Diamond members. I hate to throw that Diamond word around and hardly ever have to because most staff are informed of how to treat their best paying and loyal customers. The only word this woman knows is \u201cNO\u201d. No rooms were ready, no upgrades for HH Diamond members because the hotel is full. (This is not how Hilton Hotels operate), no chairs available for the patio (until I talked to the manager), no late checkout because the hotel is full (another Hilton Honor perk). The real deal breaker was when she finally allowed me an extra hour past the 11 am check out time, but never informed us the key would not work past 11. This was after I met another guest who was allowed 3pm checkout. Housekeeping heard me talking about the situation and voluntarily informed me I wasn\u2019t the only person who has complained about her. Even another guest in the elevator told me they had problems with her as well. I spoke to Jill the manager about this woman\u2019s attitude and demeanor and she apologized and said she would speak to her. Please do so Jill! This woman is not someone you want as the first person you meet as you enter the hotel. She sets the tone for a negative experience and has no personality. Although, she became more pleasant when the manager came out of the back to check in someone else. Mary\u2019s customer service skills are terrible and when I checked out, I asked her to please review the HH policies so she is aware of what is and is not allowed before saying \"NO\" to every request. It\u2019s a wonderful hotel but avoid dealing with Mary and you\u2019ll have a great stay.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Short Hills, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cIt's just what I expected\u201d", "Author": "ElleZ531", "ReviewID": "UR138405788", "Content": "Our family stayed here for 2 nights and it was more than perfectly fine. For this hotel brand's class level and price at peak season, it exceeded our expectations. The hotel is one month old--so everything is new and clean. Our room had comfortable clean beds (all new linens), flat screen TV, refrigerator and microwave, The bathrooms had white subway tiles on the walls, larger tan tiles on the floor and a granite sink counter top. We had a great view of the bay and pool. The pool area is a nice setting that overlooks the bay and has a tiki bar--the pool is sizable with a hot tub. At night they light up the fire pit at the pool area--so it's a nice setting watching the sunset over the bay. To get to the beach you have to cross a main 4 lane road which is a negative but it is not an interstate highway which is what I pictured from another review. The beach area was way nicer than I expected--it is expansive, clean and far enough from the boardwalk so it is not nearly as congested. The hotel has a a small indoor pool and a gym area-which we did not use but seemed good. Breakfast was more than fine for free--coffee/tea, cereals, oatmeal, hardcooked eggs, toast, fruit, pre-made omelettes, bacon etc. Coffee/tea was out and available in lobby all day and night. As a new hotel, there are some minor kinks the staff seems to be working hard to iron out. One issue is they keep running out of towels at the pool. The manager said that they started out with plenty of towels but some guests were not returning them--next summer they may have a different system with the towels. The staff were friendly and helpful--when we needed extra towels, they were brought to our room within minutes. The front desk was helpful with maps, recommended restaurants and things to do. The person who helped us with our luggage was also very nice and helpful. I do think it would be nicer if all the staff had uniforms to distinguish themselves. For dinners one night we ate at OC Steamers located in the shopping center next door to the hotel--we were surprised--the atmosphere was good, crabs were great, food reasonably priced and we could drink and walk back to the hotel. We also had dinner at Liquid Assets- which was also a surprise--the restaurant is in a wine and liquor store- but the atmosphere was nice and the food was very good--the homemade donuts were to die for.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot what expected at all!\u201d", "Author": "Familytravelguy1", "ReviewID": "UR138322135", "Content": "For what was supposed to be a brand \"spanking\" new hotel, I just did not see it. Maybe they renovated somewhere in the Hotel, but it definitely was not brand new. The common areas were filthy and unkept. Garbage all over the floors. One of the elevators was out of service. Once we got to our room, the floors were all scuffed and beat up. There was a huge grease mark on the wall. Just not what was expected for the price. Next as far as the hotel being a block from the beach, it was but no one said you had to cross a busy coastal highway to get there. When you have 2 small children and all of there beach stuff trying to navigate the crossing was a challenge.

Beds and linens are exceptional. Service is good, everyone is polite and competent. Being new, there are just a few minor things that need \"tweaked\". The free breakfast is delicious, but whoever is making the coffee - it is very weak! The outdoor pool is lovely, however - be warned - the jacuzzi leads right into the pool area, and the kids use it for a jumping off point, so it can be hard to ever get in the jacuzzi and relax. I didn't think it's a good idea for the kids who were pretty small, to jump off the ledge into the pool, I believe someone's going to get hurt eventually. Also, the staff never seems to have enough towels out at the pool area, so it would probably be a good idea to stock more towels, as there were shortages each day. It was all in all a nice stay, however, I think if I was going to spend this much money on a room again, I'd prefer to be oceanside, simply because you have to cross 8 lanes of traffic to get to the beach.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "King of Prussia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat place\u201d", "Author": "Zzzladym", "ReviewID": "UR137878965", "Content": "I came to ocean city for vacations..

During our stay, there were always empty spots on the lot. I gave it only a four as you had to cross a very busy street (eight lanes wide) to get to the beach.

It was not so easy to get a room since Kayak and other sites have listed it as sold out, my intuition guided me to call the hotel, Mary a lovely and kind lady helped us and booked the room. All we knew - that the hotel is new, how can we go wrong with a week old hotel we thought? and Hampton Inn? We got to the hotel, great fast check in! lovely, smiling people checked us in (sorry for not remembering all names but the one who stood out was Taylor and I believe her name was Angie. The Hotel: is beautiful! Everything is clean and NEW!!!!! they were still working on installing some thing and running things smoothly. We asked for recomendation for healthy dinner with young teenagers and one of the staff told us about a good a sushi place as we spoke to the staff member the lady behind the desk got on the restaurant site and printed the address, the menu AND.... a 10% coupon! (I was so happy about the way she helped us! and was very grateful!). Room: is BEAUTIFUL! CLEAN! NEW!!! The only thing that was not so great was the smell of a fresh painted room!! I think we are the first ones who stayed in the room and two of us are sensetive to fresh paint smell which caused a bit of a headache, (we stayed most of the time out and came back to sleep because we were busy) Staff: is soooo FRIENDLY and HELPFUL!!!! they really go out of their way to help and please. Pool area is mostly done and you will see worker touching up. Pool and Hot Tub - BEAUtiFUL! Breakfast was a bonus! we are vegetarians, eggs were made with bacon, and when we were asked if everything is ok by the breakfast staff we recommended to make eggs w/out meat so others can enjoy it, the staff member immediatley offered to make the eggs for us!! Karen the manager (I believe) was willing to make the eggs for our satisfaction and said that they are not really supposed to do it, we told her we are on the way to bike riding and we will be back, Karen advice us where to get bikes and how to get the coupon to recieve $2 off each bike, we followed her advice and saved on the rental. When we came back Karen asked if we are ready to eat and brought us the eggs w/out meat!! THANK YOU KAREN ! My kids were happy! Later that day we asked the concierge Zack if he knows a place to rent Jet Ski and he recommended a place, as I'm saying , \"...oops I forgot something in the room I will be back\", when I got back Zack already printed the Jet Ski's address and handed it to us!!! Once again I was so happy with their service and care. Thanks Zack we had fun! We have asked for a late check out and they allowed us to stay longer. Check out was a bit long, as the computer sys. did not work so well, but we entertained our selves with hot chocolate and coffee. We Will Come Back!
