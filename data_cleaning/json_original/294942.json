Quick Summary: Pros: Location (very small 5min beautiful walk to Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia) Friendly Staff Clean and comfortable rooms with good air con. Breakfast is plentiful Safe Box Cons (constructive): One computer with internet near lobby (this may have changed) Rooms are small but top floor had lovely balcony. Had to be moved due to double booking but this was done efficiently Breakfast never changes. Nothing spectacular or wow feel about hotel. Overall a good place to stay if u want something in easy walking distance of Blue Mosque etc. Tips: Arrange a shuttle from airport or book cheap taxi as we were 25Euros lighter after our expedition (we found place doing it for 10Euros round the corner from hotel). If you want cheap food to get by then eat the corn on cob, the bread, the kebabs. Not much flavour but get the job jone. Avoid naff cafe restaurants. Avoid being pulled to carpet shops. Avoid chemical apple tea, drink the real stuff. Always barter, treat the liras as pounds and you will do ok. Avoid taxis as they don't speak English. Buses are cheap. Trams are good. Eminomou was good stop with short walk to spice bazaar and across bridge to get to Taksim square. Lastly buy the Baclava, its expensive but delicious, rich and juicy.

There is a small balcony but with that view you wouldn't really want to sit there. In addition you'll be kept awake by the train line which runs right by the hotel.

We didn't eat in the restaurant so can't comment on it, though others who ate there said it was fine. In any case, there are plenty of good restaurants nearby. For the independent traveller, finding one's way from the airport can be hair-raising, so it might be helpful if I mention that we found a company called Backpackers on the internet, which provides a vehicle and driver to the door of the hotel for 20 euros each way.

Altough the \"elegance room\" we were finally given was large enough to take two chairs only one was provided. The bathroom had a socket for a shaver which was not flush with the wall and potentially dangerous. Access to the bath was hindered by high plastic screens so that even the able bodied would have difficulty. The light source for the shaving mirror was placed behind the head so as to make it pointless. The floors are served by two elegant marble staircases which in the uk would be classed as a health and safety hazard in that there were no friction pads on the steps and more seriously the bannister for them was boken by alcoves so a slip on one of those steps would be serious and in this state impossible to use easily by the handicapped.

We had 2 double beds stock together which was a little bet uncomfortable, nice balcony looking over some homes and at the end you can clearly see the Bosphorous Sea with all ships passing by and the main Island, very nice view day or night, but if you do not have a room with a view of the sea, you can always go to the roof restaurant and have a drink or just sit on the balcony looking at the magnificent view of the sea and some parts of Istanbul as well. The linens were always clean and changed daily, excellent decor some of the furniture pieces may need replacement. The wood floor needs some maintenance but very clean. The bathroom had a bathtub but the water was always coming through the tub to the floor of the bathroom, needs some sealant, the shower head refused to stay in-place, so would dangle and fall facing the wall and would have to hold it with one hand. I mentioned it to the front desk and promised to have some major maintenance done to all bathrooms very soon. Bathroom was generally very clean and full of all your bathroom needs every day, towels were nice and white, no stains ( you will be surprised in some brand name hotels what you can find). Finally, AC small but it works good after 30 minutes of operation, since your room key is electronic and you must insert it in its slot to connect the electricity, so you might need to ask for extra key if you need the AC on all the time. Medium Size LCD TV in room but few English Channels (BBC and EuroNews and some religious one), very boring TV system. The young lady at the front desk (Meenah) was very helpful and pleasant and made some great recommendations for visits and restaurants as well, so feel free to ask her about where to go, how to do it and when is the best time to visit. The rate included Bkfast and it is at the lower level cozy restaurant with Buffet style, some cheese, jams, cold-cuts, pastries, juices, one kinds of fruits, fresh made juices are 5 TL each and Omelets are 6.5 TL. The area is a bit small but fits most guests and very clean, there is an outdoor extension of the restaurant you can use if you smoke or like to be in the fresh air area, it is nicely done between the two parts of the hotel. Everything is dome was wood, floor, walls, and chairs and tables some are done with white leather coaches, best of all always very clean and enjoyable to eat there. The only draw back that we had to pay for the transportation from and to the airport (30 Euro each way). Most of the sights are walking distance, Sultanahmet Square, the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia Museum, Topkapi Palace, Basilica Cistern, The Obelisk, Hippodrome, and Arstar Bazar as well many many restaurants, cafes and Pups that fit all budgets. Supermarkets are also everywhere if you feel like picking up a snack or some drinks on the go for few Liras. In sum, I would definitely go back to the area and stay at the Avicenna hotel because I felt as being at home with friendly staff, clean place, convenient location and excellent view from room 202, and even the guests are great to converse with.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hemel Hempstead", "Title": "\u201cStay in the Elegance Suite!\u201d", "Author": "NikNakN00", "ReviewID": "UR70002835", "Content": "Things didn't start well with this hotel, on arrival we were told that they had overbooked and that our double room was unavailable.

The Manager of the Hotel appeared rather rude in my discussions of alternate transport from the hotel back to the airport and rather vague and unhelpful and told me to, \"go up the street and try to find an agency who books shuttle buses\". These findings make it so intriguing as to why this hotel has a 4-star rating. Further concerns about the hotel include lack of elevators, which is tiring if your room is on the 3rd floor, relentless persuasion to eat at the Hotel restaurant which is quite expensive and quite frankly has crickets for music, not to mention the barging in of hotel staff into our room before the last of my company were to leave the room, in order to debate which staff member attains ownership of goods left by guests at the hotel.

First the bad stiff. We were put into room B04. This was a single room with the bed turned sideways and a collapsable camp bed laid alongside. When I complained that we had booked a double room I was informed that this really was a double but that a new room could be made available the following day. 1 hour later when talking about the problem with friends in the lobby and our steps to complain to Jules Verne, the travel company, miraculously a new bedroom was offered. The second bed room was room 115 which as you'll realise from the other reviews is 5 metres from a railway line which runs from 5.45am till gone midnight. Good luck getting a relaxing holiday sleep here. The rooms are all nicely decorated but with zero thoughts about where the lights should be, the shelf over the sink [revents you from using it and the safe was inoperable. Its a shame because the bar staff were friendly and engaging and the location near to the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia is excellent. The restaurant evening food was very poor and we would recommend against. We'd recommend the Oceans Seven restaurant just around the corner where the service and food were excellent.", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cA Lovely hotel if you get a nice room\u201d", "Author": "Damaskfan", "ReviewID": "UR32792008", "Content": "We booked 2 excellence rooms, our friends received this level of room immediately and we were told we would be transferred into one the following day.

Additionally, their air conditioning didn't work and it was always tomorrow it would be repaired, needless to say it never was. All the balconies are small and fully open to your neigbours balcony, however, it is nice to have access to the open air. Breakfast can be had indoors or out and the seating area is lovely. There is plenty of continental style food to fill yourself each morning. I wouldn't go for the fancy looking biscuits - no taste just calories! There's a rooftop restaurant and bar - a lovely spot for a drink and a gaze at the view. We didn't try the food there so can't comment. Overbooking and moving people during their stay seems common here and judging from previous reviews there are some bad rooms to be had. This hotel is a little gem if you land in a good room. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The hotel is convenient for the main sites and there is easy access to the rest of the city. A little wander though the streets can take you to the waterfront too. Just beware of the chap outside the Best Western Obelisk Hotel when you go out in an evening. He can be more than a little touchy if you choose not to eat in the Obelisk Restaurant.

This is our 3rd visit to Istanbul and our experience at this hotel was terrible. We were enroute back to London after 9 lovely days in the regional Turkey and thought I would treat my family to a boutique hotel on our last night My wife and I managed to get 5 hours of sleep as we were assigned with a room down in the basement (non-street facing side, back of the block - note that majority of the rooms are in this block). When we open the curtain, the train tracks were just 3 metres from the window (please refer to my photos). We requested a room change 3 times and we were simply brushed off by a number of staff during our stay. They did not even offer a discount or reimbursement or any sort of compensation. Luckily, my parents who are in their mid-60s were given a room on the street side. The person working at the lobby claimed that their room was upgraded but it was exactly same size as ours so it was not actually an upgrade aside from being on the street side. Worst, we were told the trains will stop running after 8pm and this went on and on until 12am, before the first train screamed past our window at 5am. We called at 8, 10, 11 and 12am and got the same story, \"Sir, it will stop soon, it is the last train\". When your window, bed and floor shakes when a train comes past every 10 minutes, this is simply unacceptable for a room with \u00c2\u00a3172.50 per night price tag. To be fair, this hotel is very well renovated and it has excellent chill-out areas, outdoor area, breakfast room. For the price we paid, this is irrelevant when you can't sleep. I spoke to a number of clients in the hotel in the morning and they were also shocked at the noise and vibration of the room from the passing trains.", "Date": "April 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "worcersteshire", "Title": "\u201ca very mixed experience\u201d", "Author": "christina50", "ReviewID": "UR28213381", "Content": "We booked this hotel after reading the reviews which were good. Sure the location is very near the sights and great from that point of view, it is clean, breakfast was good and the staff friendly but nonone seems to have mentioned the train line which ran right next to the room we were first put in. This room was in the basement- it was tiny with nowhere to put anything and the smallest bathroom and shower I have ever seen. We were on the same level as the trains and the window looked onto the railway line- so quiet it was not. We manged to get a room change after the first night but there was a confusion and we were allocated the same room as Spanish couple who were also trying to get a change of room and who were very upset that they were paying the same as a relative who had a more spacious room with balcony. The problem is that the hotel is in 2 parts and if you are in the main bit the rooms are much better- but when the hotel is full the rooms in the block at the back and especially in the basement are not good at all. Having said this the receptionist was very friendly and tried to be helpful- we said we were returning for another stay after a trip to Cyprus and asked to be allocated a better room. On our retrun we were told there was no room for us as they had a problem with a wall falling down- we never got the full story. Now for the good news- we were put up instead at a very nearby hotel called the Darussaade- a very newly renovated gem- boutique hotel-19th Century house- We had a room with views over the bosphous and blue mosque- its probably more expensive but I would suggest it as alternative.
