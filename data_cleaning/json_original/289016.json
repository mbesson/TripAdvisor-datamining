And this place fitted the bill. Comfortable and clean, although the rooms were fairly basic. Over the 4 days we stayed here we only had breakfast twice and one evening meal but the food was very good. Overall, we couldn't get over how bizarre and quirky the place was. With Cherubs hanging from every archway and the pink castle style exterior in the middle of a residential street. A bit out of the way and in the middle of nowhere but if you're after a quiet pleasant sweet li'l hotel and you dont mind a walk and tube ride into town, then this might be the place for you too.", "Date": "March 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lee Hall", "Title": "\u201cVery nice hotel with reasonable rates.\u201d", "Author": "horselovercaligirl", "ReviewID": "UR23391340", "Content": "This was a great hotel with very clean rooms and a five star dinning experience. However, I do agree that it was NOT a castle. It is in a residential neighborhood of sorts, so you need a car. The staff was very professional and attentive. The bathroom was very clean and they had cable TV. The bed and feather comforters were warm and comfortable. You may want to bring your own toilettries and washcloth. Most of the staff did not speak English, but, hey, don't go to Germany with out learning some German!

We had a good experience. STAFF: The staff was okay, they do speak English, but not the best, but they were helpful. They didn't do a lot to help avoid noisy guests at night. HOTEL: Beautiful decor LOCATION: OK, the review previous to my review states that by taking the S bahn, it only takes 15-20 minutes to Alexander Platz, its more like 40. It was another 5 minutes to the main station. FOOD: Was fantastic- breakfast was huge. Both American and European selections. We had dinner the first night and it was great. ROOMS: Clean, comfortable beds and no air conditioning. The roooms we had were on the first floor or the basement. These rooms are by the night entrance and when noisy guests come in there late at night, its really loud and easily wakes you up. OTHER: This hotel has many weddings during the spring and summer months. The music from the wedding receptions kept us up late 2 nights. The music carried through the hotel and we could hear it in the basement on the opposite side of the hotel. Overall, this was an average hotel.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hinckley", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyed our stay\u201d", "Author": "Mrandyd", "ReviewID": "UR7404811", "Content": "Stayed over Easter 2007. Hotel is approx 15-20 mins from Alex by S-Bahn, so isn't exactly city centre. If it wasn't for the fact that we were travelling by car, and had two little kiddies we probably wouldn't stay here. But the fact we were meant this was ideal because we had free parking, had east access to the autobahn, and had big VFM rooms. The hotel is about 2mins from a S-Bahn station but this has three sets of steps to get to the platform. If you have kiddies go to the next station (Wuhretal..sp?) which has no steps and is a pleasent walk through the burbs and a park. Suburban area is superb. Lovely and relaxed, but only a short walk to Kaulsdorf centrum which has shops etc. Breakfast is OK. A bit variable in that some things where not available every day (including wursts and mustard! What is the world coming to if you can't have wurst for breakfast in Germany!) I have never said this before about a hotel, and very rarely eat in hotels, but the dinner was amazing, and recommend the pork meddalions with cheese and mushrooms. Absolutely superb! Rooms are average, but you can get connecting rooms at a discount. The travel to / from central Berlin was not a problen due to the efficiency of the transport system. All in all a great hotel in a pleasant location, great for people with kids, a car or both.", "Date": "April 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmond, OK", "Title": "\u201cLoved Park Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "TravelDocinOK", "ReviewID": "UR3813093", "Content": "In May 2005, we stayed at Park Hotel Berlin for the third time--the first was in March 2004 and then for New Year's 2004.

The hotel is immaculate and welcoming, and Mr. Klaus Hommel is one of the finest hoteliers I have encountered on three continents.
