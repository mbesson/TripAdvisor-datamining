However we were made to pay a \u00c2\u00a320 deposit on the room which there was no mention of on the website. After a very nervous trip in the elevator we got to the 3rd floor and into our room. I had decided to pay extra for a \"superior\" double compared to a regular double as we were there for one night and it was valentines day. However when we entered the small room we found a long list of problems: There were at least 5 holes in the walls One of the light switches was loose Uneven floor Single glazed windows which let in a draft and we couldn't shut properly The sink wasn't in our bathroom but in our bedroom The shower was dirty The carpets were stained The headboard was hung badly on the wall and not connected to the bed View out the back where there was some men were working on a roof There was a BIG gap in the door to the corridor, which combined with the window made a big draft which made the room very cold.

Staff were always polite & courteous. I didn't use the restaurant, however it always seemed full at meal times. I had a single room on the first floor which was small but useable. If I have any complaint it is that the floors (throughout the first floor at least) were very uneven & anyone who is unsteady on their legs might find this a problem. They also creak alarmingly. If you happen to get an insomniac or somnambulist (sleep walker) next door the creaking of the floorboards as they move around would probably keep you awake! Also, the hotel would benefit from secondary glazing as the old single glazed windows are cold & slightly draughty. One final comment, I think the hotel is long overdue for a makeover. The carpets & furniture are looking decidedly tatty & in need of refurbishment.

I could also mention that there was a problem with our booking when we arrived, the internet company that we had ordered through had only forwarded two of the three room reservations we had booked to the hotel. While I realize that this was not the hotel's fault, and did not blame them in any way for the mix-up, I do wish the staff had been more helpful and welcoming.

I had washed a black cardigan that morning and left it hanging over the back of a chair to dry, I was out of the room from 0700-2000hrs. When I arrived back my room had been cleaned and given fresh towels but my cardigan was missing. I went down to the hotel reception and they assured me apart from the cleaners noone else would have entered the room and they would check with the cleaners the next day. I followed this up and the answers were \"noone told us to forward on this message and the cleaners have gone\" (different reception staff) so I waited another 2 days until I received a reply stating they had no seen it it had not been accidently taken with the towels and that \"IT MUST BE IN MY TRUNK\" no it is not in my trunk i have looked multiple times, this issue was never resolved. My main issue (and I should have learnt from the cardigan incident) but some of my friends were keeping some of their valuables in the hotel managers safe whilst travelling to different places to decrease risk of pickpockets. I decided to leave my iphone in the safe. I had written confirmation and verbal by the staff that it would be safe and that only the manager and some reception staff had access to this safe. I confirmed multiple times about the date and time (even the day before) and was assured it was fine to pick up then. When I got there I was informed my phone had been MISPLACED. After meetings with the managers and head of Umi hotels they gave me so many excuses that it was accidently sent in the mail, there was NO LOG of this to prove and why would it have been if it was locked up safely. I had to catch my return flight to australia and was assured this matter wouldnt be forgotten just because I was out of the country. Once in Australia I was ignored completely. No replies from emails and when I tried to call the reception staff always seemed to say the managers werent in today and would leave a message. I didnt get ONE call back! My emails were only replied to (about 3 times in the total of 40 days) when I threatened to involve the police in the issue. All i wanted was one incident report from them stating what happened so I could put in an insurance claim back in Australia but they wouldnt take 5 minutes out ot their time to write it whilst I spent hours trying to organise a phone and did not have a proper phone (and still dont). I never once asked for reimbursment for my insurance excess or my time just a report and they wouldnt even do that. It proves they really do not care about customers and have no customer service. I have never complained about a hotel and the rooms were fine and so were the facilities in line with a 2 star hotel but I need to put warnings out to other travellers do not stay here!!!!

Exterior of the hotel looks brilliant and as I enter the Reception, the check-in process was alright but since we were early, we had to come back at around 2pm. We walked to a nearby restaurant for lunch and we timed properly to return to the hotel by 2pm as promised. Upon returning, we were told our rooms weren't \"ready\". The staff mistaken us for the Asian family that came about 5 minutes before and assumed we were together with them. After exchanging a few sentences, they found out we were another family. We were checked in at around 2:23pm and when we had taken the keys to our room, I was shocked to not only find out our room was extremely small for 3 people but this place looks a bit run down and shabby. It has seen its days my mum thought. The pictures online were not helpful but deceiving. Mum caught TWO cockroaches in the room and we once were greeted with one cockroach as we were leaving our room to go out. When we take our shower, we could hardly stretch our hands or move about. Shampoo and body wash weren't replenished as we thought they will. We stayed for four nights and only used their shampoo & body wash on first day and last night of our trip. Thank goodness we had our own amenities along. Price wise, it could been better for around \u00c2\u00a3130 per night. Quite pricey for this type of a hotel in London. Key cards was \"cut\" for the wrong room. Our room was on the 3rd floor but was cut for the 2nd floor. How careless I thought. The lift wasn't doing any better. Going up and down was already time consuming, stuffy, small and hardly could move if you have lots of luggages. Breakfast was just alright.

For the price i paid (GBP50 a night) and the excellent location I expected it to be tiny and probably pretty run down, more like a hostel than a hotel.. I was pleasantly surprised. The room was large with a wardrobe, big desk, plenty of moving around space, and a large window facing the square. The bathroom was tiny but serviceable - I'm quite short though and I think if I'd been taller I'd have had to put my feet in the shower when using the toilet! The basin was in the room rather than the bathroom. Everything was very clean, and not run down at all. Old, but well kept. There's no fridge or minibar, but tea/coffee and soaps in the room. The rooms are serviced every day, I can't comment on this though as I had my do not disturb sign up. The staff were always helpful and friendly, you could tell they enjoy their jobs. When I wanted ice and the bar was closed a staff member unlocked it for me and brought the ice up to my room, and then when their kitchen was closed the guy at reception called a local place for me to see if they were still serving. it's little things like that that show the difference! I've had much worse customer service in 4 star hotels. there were only 2 cons I could find - the room was really hot, the building must not be insulated very well. As an australian it wasn't an issue for me, but others might have been bothered!

If I could have switched hotels, I absolutely would have, but the University I am traveling with booked the hotel so I had no choice. Some of the staff was very nice, but the staff members who were not nice were probably the RUDEST people I have ever met. They have employees living there, which wouldn't be a big deal if they understood to be professional even when they weren't on duty, but they did not stay professional when they clocked out. There was an employee who lived across the hall from my room who was so noisy, blasting music into all hours of the night and I had to go knock on her door to ask her to be quiet because I had to get up the next morning for class and she gave me a rude look, said okay and closed the door on my face. You would think that because she lived there, she would know how thin the walls are. Also, the floors are extremely creaky, so if you want to get any sleep at night, request the 5th floor, but just know that there is no elevator to the 5th floor, you have to take the elevator to the 4th floor and then go to the steps and walk up a flight of stairs. The free breakfast in the morning is delicious, but don't expect them to get your order correct.. they got my order right 3 times out of the 2 and a half weeks I was there. Don't waste your money on the internet options they claim works, because it only works from early morning until about 5pm, and then you can't log on because the server is always \"down.\" They took our soap one day and we had to ask for it back numerous times and we didn't get it back until 2 days later?? I'm not sure what was up with that. They opened our window in our room when it had been pouring all day, nonstop, (like it does most of the time, so they shouldn't have opened it at all) and the bed by the window got soaked and the front desk didn't care at all. I just feel bad for the people running the hotel because they obviously don't know how to run a hotel. DO NOT STAY HERE. There are PLENTY of other options in London that are much better.

Hallways and rooms seem quite old. We had a \"deluxe\" room, which was pretty ok. Bed was good, tea and coffee facilities, and a sink in the bedroom... The bathroom was ok, nothing more nor less. Quite hard to flush the toilet sometimes, and the shower wasn't the cleanest. One little minus was that it was only possible to open the window by about ten centimetres, and with no aircondition it got quite hot during the night.

I stayed at Umi London for 21 days back in August-September 2008. During that time, I got to know that place pretty well. First of all, this hotel did meet all my expectations, I like the location, the price was good and it could support me during my three weeks in London. The bathroom was large enough and the shower worked just fine. The room was relatively clean, sheets felt clean as well. The room was very small but acceptable as long as it was just me and no one else. For such a small room, they do have a cabinet to put away your luggage, small desk for your laptop with a wooden chair. My single bed was bit smaller then a twin size. But the mattress was firm and pillow was great. And there is a 19 inch HDTV directly opposite of the bed but high enough that my feet don't kick it. Funny that there is no ice machine, I had to go the barkeep in the basement to get a pitcher of ice each night. They do give out free newspaper each morning at the lobby. They do have internet but you have to pay, they got two small elevators as well. In case of fire, it a definite firetrap with narrow corridors but most London hotels of this kind are like that. Its about ten minute walk to Baywater Underground Station so that is nice. They do have a on-premise restaurant but the menu looks pretty pricey. The local pubs around the hotel give you a better meal with a cheaper price....and a nice pint of beer. (For most Americans, I recommended 1688! Cold and tasty.) This is definitely no frill place to stay. Sleep quality suffered because it seem to be a noisy neighborhood at time and they got parties going until the wee hours of the night. I do not recommend staying here during the heat of the summer since there is no air conditioning. I had to beg for a fan, reminding the front desk people that I am an unacclimatized tourist from Alaska who is not used to the humid heat of London!

However, my second stay this was not a problem. I am a light sleeper though, and as this is my only criticism, it is minor. The dining area near Reception has a lovely modern decor and very pleasant to be served breakfast there. It comes as you would expect in a nice cafe - on a tray with white china, lovely fresh fruit salad. The girls working in the Dining area were extremely friendly as well.

We also ventured down to the \"restaurant\" one night for dinner but the menu is very limited & they weren't open to preparing anything that wasn't on the menu (even something as simple as a toasted cheese & tomato sandwich).

If you have any experience with a European three star hotel, then you will know exactly what you are getting with UMI - except just a bit better. It is clean, extremely close to 3 underground stops and several major bus lines (I cannot explain why any reviewer would complain about this - but some have), the service is friendly, the breakfast is fine, the televisions in the rooms are wonderful, and the Bayswater part of town is within walking distance of Notting Hill and Kensington Park. Around the front lobby areas the hotel has documented the history of the hotel's space - explaining how the row houses were converted into a hotel and who used to live in each home. I just mention this to explain the thoughtfulness put into some aspects of the hotel. It is an older building - the elevator is slow (but, hey, there IS one) and the carpet is worn in places - but, oh well. It doesn't detract from the value of the hotel or take away from your vacation in London. For three pounds you can purchase a 1 hour internet card - and if you are just using it to send an infrequent email or check theatre times you will be fine with that for your stay. There are four computers available for guests - and I never had a problem getting on any of them. Some have complained about the noise at the hotel - and I cannot explain that either. The hotel is quiet - especially at night. It is a sleepy part of town - very residential and mostly full of similar styled hotels. The doors to each room are fire doors - found frequently throughout London - and they are heavy, so they do slam. But, the noise is not bad - especially when most of the hotel is sleeping. The water pressure in the sinks and showers is awesome - and there were no problems with water temperature either. Each day we received fresh towels and our room was cleaned. The television gets many, many channels. The bed is not great - but it is clean and good enough. The room is small, but it won't be a surprise if you do some research first (like reading this!). The room is good enough for sleeping, showering, dressing, and storing your things - you shouldn't be spending much time in the hotel anyway! We were there in August - so it was hot, but not too bad - we kept our windows open all the time for cooler air (and, I would still say the hotel is quiet!). The morning breakfast is good enough - hot drinks, pastries, cereal, yogurt. There are plenty of daily newspapers and magazine available to take. There is also a place to store your luggage if you arrive too early or fly out late (if you want to store something important behind the front desk instead of in the municipal storage closet, just ask). All in all - it was a great place to stay. You cannot beat the price - and, it is important to mention, even though this is a budget hotel, you are not treated like a budget traveler - nor do you feel like one staying here. The staff is helpful, and the hotel is full of happy travelers from all over the world - families, college students, older people, married couples - I was quite surprised because I guess I was expecting just travelers like me (young).

We even had a mini walk-in wardrobe. Nice wallpaper, and an Audrey Hepburn theme which seem to carry throughout the hotel. Both room and bathroom were clean although the some of the bathroom fixtures should be updated. It took us a while to get used to how to turn on hot water for the shower. The hotel provided kettle, hair dryer and there was a flat screen tv with cable. Iron can be provided on request. I would suggest that you also leave your windows open when you're out and about because we occasionally returned to the room and there was a strange smell. We didn't know what it was, but put it down to poor ventilation. Like when you walk into a school demountable that hasn't been aired out. Also, there's no elevator to the 5th floor because its on the roof so you take the elevator to the 4th and then take the stairs. The service however was FANTASTIC! The reception, staff at breakfast as well as the cleaners were very friendly. The staff were very helpful in recommending nearby restaurants, routes to supermarkets, cinemas and sites. When we needed to print tickets out for a tour we booked to Stonehenge they were eager and willing to print it for us. Also, because the room doesn't have a fridge, if you have some food you need to store in the fridge, you can just give it to them with your name and room number and they'll store it for you. Another example is when we returned at 10.30pm and wanted cake but the hotel cafe was closed. The staff still went out of their way to get it for us. The hotel also offers a free service if you want to book tours or shows. He also provided us with a walking tour route of London. Breakfast was good, but its not buffet-style. Every morning you choose 4 things off their menu and then they serve it to you. Plenty of newspapers to read! Location was PERFECT!

We stayed for four nights, having booked from overseas and having had friends who stayed here. It wasn't much for *London* prices (89GBP to 139 GBP) but it still seemed like a complete waste of money. We were woken on the first morning by obscene shouting coming from the corridor/next room. I thought maybe it was guests and ignored it for a while, but when we left I realized who was making the noise. We were next to room service's little 'office' on the third floor. Okay, so the doors and walls were thin. But on the last morning we were woken by room service shouting about the \"[--] bottles in the room, why are there so many [--] bottles in the bl**dy room.\" Nice. Perhaps because we didn't tip room service, they basically didn't bother to clean the room after the first day; I mean, they made the bed, but they didn't bother wiping down the sink (which is in the bedroom, yes). There was also the matter of the leaking bath faucets, which probably disturbed someone downstars, as a hotel employee tried to get into our room while my fiancee was showering in order to see whether we were somehow joyously spraying water all over the bathroom. They didn't fix it that day while we were out; instead we went through the same rigmarole the next morning; this time, we were finished our showers and let them in to look at the tub. They fixed it with a LOT of grout. The hotel needs a bit of repair; creaking floorboards and shrieking taps are a noisy, bed is really uncomfortable and you just roll off it basically... the tub is cracked and the bathroom ceiling was mouldy ... but okay, this is budget... yes, the tv worked fine (except when you plug something in--and then it just stops) ... Probably the best part of this was on the third night when we arrived back to find a full bag of garbage in our room left by room service. I guess they 'forgot' it. Awesome. I took it down to reception and they wrote something down in their little book, apologized... but that was it. I guess that was business as usual at Umi Hotel.

The weather was particularly bad and when I did finally arrive at reception, I was completely soaked through. Then a young man at the desk tried to convince me that I had cancelled my booking the previous week! I asked for a manager and when she arrived both her and the young man had a full-blown argument right in front of me!

I stayed just one night and when I was checking out a girl tried to charge me for my stay \u00e2\u20ac\u201c despite the fact that I had paid online months previous and had a receipt to prove it. She called the manager and I got held up for over an hour trying to convince them I had in fact paid. This was highly embarrasing as the lobby was full at the time and I was treated with no sensitivity whatsoever. Finally, after a call from my credit card provider to the manager, they accepted that they had already recieved payment. I then told the girl & the manager that I had not enjoyed my stay at all and would not be recommending the hotel to anyone. At this, the girl actually had the cheek to roll her eyes and laugh! I asked her if she was laughing at me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I could hardly believe my eyes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and she made a face at me!!! Her manager, standing beside her, never said a word to her!

The only problem I first saw was the very tiny and slow elevator, which you could out run on the stairs without actually running. Overall, I can overlook that part. The parts I cannot overlook are: 1. Smelly halls and room: not terribly smelly, but they could have a redo of old and warn carpet and that would do the job. 2. Stale cigarette smelling sheets: The bed smelled still of someone's smoke. 3. The creaking floor: The floor made ALOT of noise when you walked in the room or the hall. 4. Terrible bathroom: No washcloths and constantly smelled slightly like urine. 5. Prowlers: Someone went into my luggage while I was out at least two times, perhaps three times. I could not find several of my things after I left (which I could have left behind, like foot power). The parts that are worth mentioning are: 1. Good location: very nice area of Bayswater, near the Bayswater, Queensway and Notting Hill Gate stations (a walk though). 2. Quiet: Other than a few loud voice in the hall, the hotel and neighborhood seemed quiet. 3. Breakfast: The breakfast was not bad, but free, mainly continental, with a selection of bread/roll, cereal/yohgurt, milk/juice/bottled water, and tea/coffee/chocolate. Overall, it think this place is dumpy by my standards, but for the price and its location in London, a slightly below average place. I stayed here three nights and that was enough. It would be okay for maybe only one night, but I would not push it any longer than that. I figured that the place was about \u00c2\u00a390-\u00c2\u00a3100 a night.

For example- the computers they have for guests to use (for a small fee...1hr for 3 pounds) were not hooked up to printers. When I needed to print something the staff let me email my documents to them, and they printed them right out, with no extra charge. Apparently the breakfast has recently changed from some sort of continental buffet to ordering off of a limited continental menu, still included in the price. We never attempted the cooked breakfast as the cereal, fruit, juice, coffee and croissants were enough to hold us until lunchtime.

You're only a few minutes away from Bayswater and Queensway tube stations, so you've got access to the Central and Circle and District lines, and you're a few minutes from the lively Queensway too, lots of shops, restaurants, pubs.

Bit worrying. Our main problem was with the breakfast. The breakfast room staff were rude and unhelpful and the cooked breakfast was like nothing i've ever experienced! The meat just tasted awful (I'm a fussy eater but even my less discerning friends were disgusted), the scrambled eggs were watery etc. The continental breakfast is ok though (average, nothing to rave about, but much more edible than the cooked one and as it's included in the price, it's worth eating to keep you going until lunchtime!)
