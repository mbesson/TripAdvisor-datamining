The Hotel itself has a nice design, the lobby and the room had a nice touch, not too artsy, but still not just a standard Hotel design. The location is also very nice, in a quiet part of L'exiample, walking distance from Placa Catalunya and Sagrada Familia, and a lot of nice bars and restaurants in the neighbourhood. The room was not too big, but sufficient, nicely furnished and comfortable. The bathroom was nothing too special, and here the age showed a little: The tiling was a little worn (but not shabby, just not perfectly clean like I'd ecpect from a 4*S Hotel) and there were no practical hanger for the towels (which also looked a little worn). The room itself also showed some very minor signs of wear and tear, very minor things such as chipped paint, strangely behaving light switches etc. Nothing that would really spoil the stay, but these minor things add up, leaving behind a somewhat tainted impression. The room had a small balcony, which was very nice, however there's a light on it, bright as the sun, which could not be turned off manually but was switched off aroun 1 am. We never went to bed before that time, but I can imagine that if you need a good nights sleep and have to get up early, this can be bothersome. The view an the back yard is not too nice, as to be expected in a residential area, and there's a schoolyard (or similar) which was a little noisy on the weekday. The service was alawys very friendly and helpful, there was always somebody who spoke good English. The bar on the roof was very nice, unfortunately due to high walls, there was no view from there.

What a pleasant surprise - I loved the hotel. The room is very small though and if one is used to staying in bigger hotels then this is not going to rock your boat. It did for me since I was in a mood to be lost and this was the perfect setting. Pick any loft in SOHO, NYC and that is it!!! The hotel charged 20euros extra on check in since I wanted a room with a balcony (I smoke) but then I realized most of the rooms have balconies. But that is OK and I did not mind since I was paying very little for the 3 nights I stayed there (I am used to spending more when in Barcelona). The room was very clean and the bathroom though small was cosy and worked well. It had a nice panel with jets.I liked the wooden panelling and overall it was cosy. I did not try any food at the hotel so cannot comment on it but the place lots of nice features. Location is also as good as it gets and you are very close to everything. Why four stars ---- the internet never worked. I paid for a card like I usually do but it just refused to work. It works in patches when you are in the lobby but it just did not work at all when in the room all four days. Its totally business hotel and the staff could be a bit cold too.

The staff was always friendly and gracious, and helped us call ahead to confirm reservations or take care of things for us.

The Eastern art and exposed brick were trendy, though perhaps a bit 90s, but it had the feel of staying in a New York loft at a cool friend's house, which is appealing. We were happy with it for the price we paid in the low-season (check prices, because they seem to have a great deal of variation depending on when you are visiting). I was more than happy to pay for the room at the winter price, but would have been disappointed had we been paying high season rates for what we had. The location was convenient, near good restaurants, walking distance to high-end shopping, and just a few blocks from the metro - from which you can easily get to anywhere. Downsides were the views were either a construction site from the front of the hotel, or looking back into an inner court-yard of the surrounding block complete with people hanging out their laundry. The breakfast buffet was adequate, but not astounding. The mattress was thin, particularly by luxury hotel standards. I did not like the cloying smell of the incense or fragrance they use in the lobby, made it smell like a 70's shag-pad too musky and sweet, but that's only a minor complaint.

There were only few table left. The guy came to us , asking \"do you know that you can only eat for 15 mins?\" in a way that I tried to persuade myself, \"his English is not good so he's just trying to be direct\" and kindly replied with a smile, \"yes, we do\". We were left alone there, until I saw him coming to a woman siting at the back-side table and asking if she would like to have some more orange juice, and later pouring some water for her when she said so. Then he came to another table and asked them, and fulfilled their requirements. But not to us. 15 mins later, breakfast time ended, but few more people came in the room and picked things to eat.

We were never asked for drink refills at breakfast and it was hard to draw the waiters attention as soon as we were served once. And WiFi should definitely be free for more than one hour a day. We did not use the rooftop terrace but it looked very nice (pool is very small though) and like a good place to relax. We also didn't try the hotel's restaurant for dinner but can recommend \"Paco Meralgo\" for Tapas and \"Osmosis\" for a lovely special occasion dinner.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "cardiff", "Title": "\u201cFirst visit to Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "lavisse", "ReviewID": "UR117087483", "Content": "A small chic hotel that we visited with our daughters aged 25 and 23.

After reading the reviews and looking at hundreds of hotels on line I settled on this hotel. Location - brilliant nicely away from the 'manic' Rambles but close enough to allow you to walk everywhere. 10mins into the centre and a further 15mins to the beach / harbour. In the area there were lots of lovely restaurants and cafe's, we were advised by the hotel to either eat close or by the harbour and not in the main centre, we stuck to this and enjoyed our meals. Hotel - the hotel is small and friendly, I booked one of the duplex suits meaning we had a the semi-private terrace which was only shared by four other rooms and was brilliant, each of the four seating areas was secluded by plants and made the stay even more enjoyable. The roof terrace was also very nice and relaxing Food - we didn't eat at the hotel, instead we went out and enjoyed the local cuisine I had read a few bad comments about the beds, I have to say this seems to have been addressed as I was very happy with the quality of the bed and bedding and I am a nightmare sleeper! The black out blinds helped a lot too Our room was cleaned every day and both towels and bedding changed whenever requested. Barcelona - what an amazing place, the city, harbour and beach made it a perfect get away. Be prepared to eat late - 10pm is normal and bars are all open until about 2pm with clubs even later (so glad we stayed out of the main centre as I can imagine it gets very noisy at night) Bus Tour - we paid \u20ac60 for two of us for two days and to be honest I thought it was a waste as we only used it twice and this was simply to get back from the beach to the centre. It was far to hot to sit in traffic on the top of a bus and we are much happier to walk around and really see the place we came to visit and not view it from afar Metro - big thumbs up, once you know where you are and where you need to get to then this is simple, quick and really cheap, 1 single ticket to any location \u20ac1.90 All in all great experience, i would go back to Barcelona and Granados 83 tomorrow if i could", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cvery friendly, we'll be back!\u201d", "Author": "Roshan S", "ReviewID": "UR116567035", "Content": "The first thing I wanted to say, is a big thanks to the staff.

A few blocks off the main thoroughfare and smaller stylish rooms provided much better value and satisfaction for us. The staff tries to be helpful and friendly. Although we encountered relatively minor problems, the front desk staff worked to resolve them as soon as they could within their constraints. We would still recommend subject to caveats. Some caveats from our experience to keep in mind: 1. We made reservations well in advance. We checked-in late morning and dropped off our luggage until return when our room would be ready late afternoon. However, upon our return, we were escorted to the handicap room just a few feet away from the front desk on the lobby level. There was a lack of privacy from the window, the noise from the lobby carried over, and the ventilation from the kitchen below created a slight odor in the room. We were told we could not move to a new room until the next day; likely due to a large group leaving the next day. There was some confusion about the room change, but the staff seemed to be sensitive to our preferences. 2. The Internet service is slow. With rarely a wait, the business services area consisted of a counter with relatively slow service to load web sites for general info and to check email. One hour of free Wifi is offered from the rooms. We found it fine for email. Voice only Skype was often interrupted and we often reverted to chat only. Don\u2019t even think about Skype video. 3. The front desk staff was familiar with the basic tourist information, but was likely not as well informed as we would have thought. One person indicated only 3 weeks of experience. We quickly learned more from other tourists in the lobby or tour books. But otherwise, the staff wanted to help putting us in the right direction. 4. The staff might have educated us better on the various services and amenities in the hotel. For instance, not until the last of our three night stay did we notice a nice roof top bar, etc.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, UK", "Title": "\u201cGreat neighbourhood, would stay again\u201d", "Author": "schiocco", "ReviewID": "UR114140365", "Content": "Just got back from 5 nights at Granados 83 - booked a deal through a travel agent and secured free breakfasts which were always good (plenty of food and variety, lots of fresh fruit, nice coffee) We found the room to be very stylish and to our taste.

The room was cleaned to a high standard daily and the amenities were good (although slightly 'style over substance' e.g. bathroom door a bit sticky and light system a little confusing). My only annoyance was that the toiletries provided, although looked nice, smelled oddly savoury (I thought of vegetable stir fry every time I used them!) - not appealing to me, but that's probably just my personal taste. The location is excellent. We attempted dinner in a different neighbourhood one night, but it did not live up to 'home'. Plenty of great bars and restaurants. Taller de Tapas on La Ramblas was our favourite. The hotel is walking distance to many sights, although the train/underground is just as easy and very affordable. The construction works at the junction outside the hotel did not bother us. Our room overlooked them on the 3rd floor, but they only worked waking hours and it served the make the road below pedestrianised and therefore remarkably quiet.

The telephone by my bed did not work. When I told the receptionist he simply told me that I was wrong and that it did work. The porter came with me and confirmed it did not work and it remained out of service throughout my stay. The telephone in the toilet did work though. The music system in my room was faulty and the volume was broken. The porter confirmed this but it remained broken throughout my stay.

The porter confirmed this and explained to me how to use it. The battery was flashing on the screen as being low so I was lucky to have got my belongings out of it. I asked for an iron to iron my shirt an hour before going out on Saturday night. I was told that there were no irons and ironing boards and that I had to use the laundry service and pay for it to be ironed. The problem was that I would have had to put it in for ironing in the morning if I wanted it ready for 8pm that night. Therefore I could not iron my shirt that was creased from having been in my suitcase. There were no instructions in the room to explain how to use any of the room amenities. The minibar contained small bottles of water that were over 3 Euros each. I did not use the hotel catering. On the positive side the hotel is good to look at with a stylish interior design.

There are two very nice places less than a block away (Gresca and La Provenca) and probably another 20 or more within walking distance--of note, Fonda Gaig, Alba Granados, Paco Meralgo, Windsor--I could go on and on. And if you're not of a mind to go out for dinner, the hotel restaurant is perfectly respectable with a limited but nice menu for very reasonable prices served, depending upon the situation either in their lovely downstairs dining room or on their rooftop terrace. Besides being well-located for dining, Granados 83 is in the middle of things for sight-seeing, only a couple of blocks from Passeig de Gracia, a main fashion street and the site of a couple of Gaudi's most famous buildings. It's also well located for access to transportation even though Enric Granados street itself is less-trafficked making for quiet sleeping. Like so much of Barcelona, Granados 83 sports a super-design vibe with small but well laid out rooms, striking entry and glass elevators that let you see how the current renovation into a hotel from an earlier use took shape. Rooms are attired in dark colors but with sparkling white bathrooms with super-modern furnishings. Staff were helpful in arranging dining reservations for us both before our arrival and after we got there and had a chance to scope out some places. The young man who tends their door and hails cabs, etc. couldn't be more friendly, smiling, welcoming and charming. And we love his signature turned up hat. Best of all, if you will be there during off-peak season, Granados 83 offers wonderful rates to keep their rooms filled. We have been there in March and February and have marveled at our good luck in securing rooms in a 4 star + hotel for rates we'd be happy to pay in a 3 star. We travel a lot, in Europe especially, and I'd venture to say have stayed in over 200 hotels over the years.

It was recommended by a friend who lives outside of Barcelona who refers many business associates to this hotel. While we really liked the location and the comfort of our room there were some things that really bothered us about the hotel staff. We originally booked 4 nights and the day before we left my husband called and asked if we could add a night to the front end. He was told no problem that they had availability. Upon our arrival we were told they did not have a double room available, but did put us in a single room and we moved the next night, a bit inconvenient, but they did accommodate us. We asked to talk to the manager and we were told he would be in on Monday morning. On Monday morning we asked for him again and were told he was in meetings and would be back later. Later we were told he was busy so we asked for him to call us; he never did. It appears Mr. Behn was too busy or did not want to bother talking to us. Another problem was the information we received from the front desk. Although everyone was very nice most of the information they gave out was erroneous. The first night I asked about the Magic Fountains near Placa de Espanya and was told there were no shows in the winter. I told the receptionist attendant that my guide books said there were shows Fridays and Saturdays, but she insisted that it was closed. My husband and I decided to go anyway and found the show was in progress. Next my husband asked about getting a wireless connection and they promptly came to our room and gave us a piece of paper with the username and password, but unfortunately the other side of the paper had guest names, reservation numbers, booking agencies along with other information, but the most troubling was that is also had their CREDIT CARD NUMBERS! We brought it home and shredded it. Another day we asked what time a particular restaurant opened up and without looking it up the gentleman at the desk told us 1:30. It is a very popular lunch spot so we wanted to get their early as they did not take reservations. When we got there at 1:00 the restaurant appeared to have been open for awhile because it was full and many people were waiting to be seated; again, inaccurate! Another time we asked what the dress code was at the casino and were told that my husband had to wear a jacket. Not true, there were people there is sweat suits and shirts, no jackets. These are just a few examples of the incorrect info we received. None of this ruined our trip, but just beware: DO NOT RELY ON THE FRONT DESK FOR INFORMATION ABOUT THE CITY! The only one at the hotel that we could depend on for solid information was the door man, Kamara, who made the stay at this hotel most enjoyable.", "Date": "February 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent modern hotel, very stylish and thoughtfully designed.\u201d", "Author": "nansari111", "ReviewID": "UR93633016", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay at Granados 83.

Another slight downside was that the front desk was not especially helpful with recommendations. I wanted a good, traditional tapas restaurant in the Old Quarter.

The view out the back isn't great - it backs onto blocks of flats and a basketball court. I was on the 6th floor and their wireless internet didn't reach. Instead they rented me an ethernet cable for 10 euros, after which it was free. That's rare, and was appreciated. So - take a cable and avoid the charge ... Extras, e.g. mini-bar, laundry, were as pricey as usual (5.80 for a little gin, 9.00 to wash a pair of jeans). Would I stay again? Perhaps.

We loved the hotel and LOVED Barcelona. It is very trendy and modern. I liked the brick exposure in the rooms. Although the view out our window was bad because the building across has been demolished so it was an empty lot. We had a large room with a couch and desk. The wall would slide over to cover the TV and desk area. There also was electric blinds that would come down to make the room extra dark. The light switches were a little confusing and we still never really figured them out. If you turned the switch in the bathroom off it would sometimes turn all the lights off. It was a little weird. The bathroom was large also. The staff was great and very helpful with all of our questions. They helped me find tons of places when I asked. THere was a computer downstairs where you could use the internet for free. We didn't eat at the hotel so I can't comment on that. There's a great pastry place across the street and coffee place around the corner. The pool on the roof is small, but who really lays out while in Barcelona! There's a nice bar upstairs but it closes a few times through out the day. The only bad thing about the hotel location is that it's almost too quiet. We like a few bars near our hotel for late night stops. Also, the metro is a little walk, about 10 minutes. We were there in the summer and it was very humid so a 10 minute walk was alot. It looks like there is a metro near the hotel, but it's the line that only goes far distances or Plaza Cataluyna. Also, you could hear the elevator from our room and we weren't really that close to it. We could hear people leaving the upstairs bar late at night going down the elevator. There was a slider door to enter the wing of the hotel that would click since it was automatic and we could also hear that. We just wore earplugs on the nights that we needed sleep. It wasn't so bad that we complained about it but it did annoy us. Overall I would stay here again but I might check out another equivalent hotel closer to the metro.

A Metro stop about 5 mins to the hotel will see even those who hate walking kept happy. Also, I had requested a room with a balcony and was granted a corner room (511) with a view onto the residential square with a school and apartments behind the hotel. A good size double room, well appointed with Egyptian artefacts, chaise longue and a modern, clean bathroom. At 220 euro for the weekend, it was absolutely great value! I had also requested a half bottle of red wine with some local chocolates which were very good.. the perfect thing to sit out on your balcony for a little while watching Barcelona life go by before heading out for a night! Yes they don't provide irons, but honestly, that's about the only thing you could fault the room for and for us, it didn't matter in the slightest! The staff were helpful and faultlessly polite. (You couldn't say they'd go too far out of their way for you, but that seems to be the way with city hotels generally!) The only thing I would quibble is the breakfast, which at about 19 euro (and non-cooked) is too pricey for my liking, but you'd be mad to eat breakfast in a hotel when staying in a city like Barcelona. One recommendation I would make is a Tapas Bar called 'Catalunya' on the corner of Calle Mallorca and Calle Catalunya... this is a real find if you're into your fresh food!

I arrived from the US early on a Tuesday morning, and didn't actually check in until later that night (I had to go to my office after I dropped off my bags). When I finally did check in, I asked for an iron so that I could get some of the wrinkles out of my work clothes for the next day -- I was told that they possessed no such thing as an iron, and that all laundry was sent out: the best they could do was have a suit pressed for me the NEXT AFTERNOON. I went to work a little wrinkly the next day, and decided to have all my laundry pressed during the day - it wasn't brought back to me until 11pm. I really try to recognize that my perspective in an American one, and that Spain moves with less urgency, but really, the ironing situation was really just not good enough. As for the internet situation at the Granados, it's unacceptable - the wifi simply didn't exist in my room (although I did have a signal near the elevators, closer to the center of the hotel), and the wired connection just plain didn't work. The \"gym\" was the size of a closet, and contained an uncomfortable stair-stepper and a bike... still, better than nothing.

Unbeknownst to us, we had a reservation at this hotel during Mobile Telecom Week in Barcelona. All of the hotels in the city were fully committed, however since we booked far in advance, we received a discounted rate for our room. We were staying at another hotel in Barcelona prior to checking to this hotel. My husband called the Granados prior to check in to inquire whether we could request early check-in because I was pregnant and feeling very ill that day. The front desk said they were working on check-outs and would call us if they could accommodate us earlier. Thirty minutes later, just as we were walking over to the Granados from our prior hotel, the front desk called us and told us that they are transferring us to a \"sister\" hotel. That's it! They did not ask us if it was okay with us, offered any explanation, or gave us any alternatives. When we asked why, and they gave us some nebulous answer that there was some \"technical difficulties\" with one of their floors and so they have a shortage of rooms. When pressed about what these technical difficulties were and how many rooms were lost, they declined to answer. We told them that we didn't believe them because they would have told us about such a catastropic technical difficulty which took away several of their rooms when we called 30 minutes earlier. They had nothing to say to that either. We were so mad, especially upon checking into their sister \"five star\" hotel. It was old and dated, among many other problems. Definitely NOT even three stars! We were promptly given two twin beds, even though we requested a king/queen. We called the Granados back and demanded to speak to the manager. This is the worst part of all: THE HOTEL MANAGER OF THE GRANADOS NEVER TO THIS DAY EVEN GAVE US THE COURTESY OF CALLING US BACK TO HEAR OUR GRIEVANCES. An hour or two later, they merely had room service send up a bottle of cava to \"make up\" for our troubles. At this point, I was so sick that I could only lie in bed. So, my husband decided for my sake to just accept the circumstances. The next day, the sister hotel offered to \"upgrade\" us to a junior suite, but, believe me, it was not much of an upgrade. An even more outdated room with more square footage. Again, we never ever heard from the management at Granados. I THINK THE GRANADOS 83 IS A DESPICABLE PLACE AND I WOULD NEVER GIVE MY RECOMMENDATION FOR ANYONE TO STAY HERE. It's a shame because we otherwise had a fabulous \"baby-moon\" in Barcelona.

Having read some of the previous reviews I was a bit worried about noise etc but it was not a problem. This was a special treat so I booked a duplex room, which has a bedroom upstairs with shower room and wc and a living room downstairs with bath, shower, wc. Off the bedroom there was outside steps leading up to a sectioned off roof terrace with a long narrow \"pool\". So, two wardrobes, 2 showers, 4 bathrobes, endless fluffy towels plus two pool towels and 2 minibars and LCD Tvs! On our first night we came back from a restaurant to find that we had been given a complimentary bottle of Cava. Even the glasses (by Schott) were designer. A nice touch. Pluses As mentioned by other reviewers, the staff at the Grenados are really nice and genuinely interested in people having a good time. They were very helpful answering my questions and recommending hotels. They were professional, unobstrusive and a real asset. The Housekeeping was outstanding. Our room was checked 3x a day and any used towels replaced. They were also very generious with the toileteries. The bedroom had a comfortable bed and the blackout blinds were really effective. It was very quiet. The lighting and lit antiquities in the corners all added to the atmosphere. We had the \"fried eggs\" on the pillow bit too which was a bit strange........ The rather funky music and music system took a bit of getting used too, imagine trance and club chill music and this should give you some idea! By the 3rd night I was looking forward to some of the tracks however! The pool terrace bar upstairs and the atmosphere both at 7:30 in the evening and when we came back after going to a restaurant, was chilled. Other guests seemed to meet up there too and the cocktails, particularly the mojitos were lovely if very strong! We were there until 1am on two nights (the official closing time is 2am). The semi-private pool was nice but is really a strip of water that runs along the terrace and you can't really swim in it. It was also cold but we are used to this! Having our own sunloungers, table and umbrella on the terrace was a plus. We had breakfast at the hotel once on the day we checked out and it was good. We ate in the restaurant the first night and the food was modern Mediterranean My husband had a tuna tartare with wasabi sorbet which was exceptional. Again the lighting and design of the restaurant and outside eating area all added to the experience. Minuses The cocktails were on the pricey side as was the restaurant but the quality was good. The downstairs shower flooded the floor, the bath has a channel running around it which fills up with water when the shower is on and floods the floor. The view from the semi-private terrace was uninspiring, and, if you book the duplex rooms leading from the ground floor( we had 206) you are a bit overlooked from the balconies above. I understand that there are duplex rooms on the 5th/6th floor but you may get more noise from the bar there. Finally, the steps in the connecting rooms are all in orange marble and the floors are wood, with the low lighting it would have been easy to miss one. There is a railing going down from the bedroom to the hall area but not to the sitting room.

Though small, the rooms are really chic (though perhaps too masculine for some women's taste). The designers did not scrimp on materials, and it shows. Beautiful wood and wood veneer throughout. Leather and marble also used in large quantities. Great black-out shutters, too. The entire staff was extremely friendly and professional. The location is also very desireable, close to the tourist center, but not directly in it, a two block walk from the less-toursity part of Las Ramblas (Rambla de Catalunya) and a similar number of blocks from the Metro. THE BAD: The closet is a tight fit, but the real complaint (as in most \"boutique hotels\") is the noise. A good-looking hotel is great, but if you can't sleep, what's the point? In fact, I'm growing so exasperated with this problem that I'm ready to go back to the Holiday Inn! Halls are covered in hard, noise-echoing surfaces, which serve to amplify the sounds of slamming doors and housekeepers rustling trash bags. I don't remember ever having trouble sleeping at a hotel (when not under construction) until the boutique trend started. Soon I'll get over being a slave to design... THE UGLY: I booked a \"single room\" since I was traveling alone. A double bed was specified at the time of booking, so nothing seemed suspicious and I assumed this referred to the number of travelers. Wrong! Imagine my surprise when taken to my room only to find that it had no outside exposure! It was really tiny (okay, I can live with that), but I could not accept that the window looked into the indoor lobby atrium. No sunlight, no air, nada! And what really galled me is that when I went to ask for a different room, the otherwise pleasant clerk breezily told me that all single rooms have \"windows onto the patio.\" As if I should have known better than to expect a window to the OUTSIDE. First of all, it isn't a \"patio\" if there's a solid roof over it (not even glass). The clerk tried to convince me that what I didn't have was a \"view.\" I explained that what I didn't have was a window, even if the view was only of an airshaft. The solution? You guessed it... I paid 30 euro a night extra to upgrade to a \"double room\" which was only slightly larger, had the same-sized bed, but had an actual window. This disingenousness on the part of the hotel marketers--and the training they've given the staff on how to respond to the resulting complaints--cast a shadow over what would otherwise have been a mostly-pleasant stay. The hotel group needs to be honest with customers at the time of booking, and let them decide whether or not they can live without exposure to the outside world. Otherwise, they are employing bait-and-switch tactics which are unethical.", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bristol", "Title": "\u201cChic, sexy and modern\u201d", "Author": "Petrushka3", "ReviewID": "UR18885255", "Content": "Stayed at the Granados on business rather than pleasure and obviously this puts a different perspective on my stay.

Even giving us free drinks at one point. At night this space is special especially with the recent full moon and quiet neighbourhood. The staff were friendly and multilingual and seeemed rightly impressed with their hotel. The only downsides I can think of is that it's 5 euros to play any music from the media TV thingy.

It is a very charming hotel, in a very nice area of Barcelona.

Upon further conversation it came out that the Granados 83 most likely did have the rooms at the time we booked, but decided that they could get more money for the rooms and so gave ours to someone else.

The terrace is shared between 4 or 5 rooms (although we did not see anybody else out there during our 3 night stay) and has a swimming pool running along the length of it. Whilst the pool was too cold to use suring late October it was a lovely feature and made the terrace very relaxing. I can imagine during a hot summer this would be lovely for a dip after a long day walking around the city. All the staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful and all spoke good English. I cannot comment on the food as we ate outside the hotel. The breakfast is rather expensive at 16 Euros and there are plently of places nearby to get a coffee and some breakfast and sit outside and watch the world go by.

The team were great - they were all so helpful and friendly and really seemed to care if you were enjoying your stay. Our room was on the small side, but it was perfectly adequate and i'm sure that they would have moved us if we could have been bothered. The air conditioning was quite loud so we had them turn it off and the toiletries were a bit naff, but if these are the only things one can moan about, then it shows how good a hotel it was! Rooms are fairly trendy - funky lights - low level LED's in the shower etc, lots of Zebra wood and flat screen TV's, white marble bathrooms. Lovely Mojito's on the roof terrace overlooking the sky line and staff happy to chat about life in Barcelona.

From a design point of view its ultra-modern and quirky but doesn't lose anything on comfort in the process. The standard ot cleaning was excellent - rooms were attended to twice daily and sweets left on the bed each day.

We stayed there 13-16 July and had not one problem during this time. It's in a great location in the L'Eixample district and is up the Ramblas from the heavily tourist populated Barri Gottic district (we visited here one evening but found it too hectic for a relaxing weekend in BCN and headed back to our hotel's district to relax!). We felt the area where the hotel is gave more of an insight into Barcelona life with less hustle and bustle and a lovely relaxed atmosphere in the area. The hotel has a very comfortable, trendy New York loft style. There's a great terrace bar and swimming pool on the roof which is great by day to catch some sun and enjoy a drink while relaxing and by night it's great to return up there after a meal for a night cap in the balmy night air with some cool music in the background. FOOD: The reception and bar staff are 'very' helpful - just ask them for recommendations for where to eat and you won't be disappointed. Over the three nights we stayed we ate near the hotel. The nicest meal we had was in 'Windsor Restaurant' a few blocks from the hotel. Try the DELICIOUS gastronomique/tasting menu (\u20ac70pp incl wine) - I would say the nicest meal I've ever had! Have a drink in the Dry Martini bar near by before your meal. Very stylish place and a great way to start the evening. They have lots of different types of martinis and they also do other cocktails including a delicious Bloody Mary and beers etc. Also excellent is the more expensive (but worth it) La Dama Restaurant for fine, delicious food and excellent service (\u20ac100pp meal and wine). Finally, go to Cerveceria Catalana for excellent tapas and a wonderful atmosphere - we ate here on our first night as we were looking for something light on arrival - grab a place at the bar or wait for a table - again all three of these places are a stroll from the hotel. Overall Barcelona is a great place to visit for a weekend. Do take the Tourist bus (jump on anywhere and buy a ticket) to get your barings. It's a wonderful way to see the city especially in the summer where it might be too hot for too much walking - The Parc Guell is lovely - our tip, grab a sandwich and drink on the way there (a street on the way uphill has a supermarket on the left near the top of the road). We thought in hindsight it would be nicer to grab a quiet place to sit and eat in the shade and enjoy the nice atmosphere and music playing around the park than sit at the cafes which are perfectly good but busier. Le Pedera is probably best visited earlier in the morning. We passed by in the morning and there were no queues, later in the day the queues were very long.

Very pleasant rooms and bathrooms: well-appointed with attention to detail. There is a great gastro -cafe across the street and if you want a simple steak and chips head out the main door and turn left for 50 feet.
