Kim, the women working the front desk at the time was amazing. She was so helpful in such many ways. If we wanted to do something she would call for us and make arrangements. We also loved that fact that when you would check into the inn that they would provide you with a complimentary drink. The pool and spa were again very clean and always stocked with towels. The cont. breakfast was up to par. We both fell in love with this place so much that we tried to book another night here but unfortunately it was full.

Our room had a king bed and a small closet. The bathroom was really new looking with a fabulous shower and great sink area. The hotel rooms surrounded the pool area which was the center of activities, including breakfast and drinks at the bar in the evening. The pool is decent sized, not for swimming laps but great for lounging and cooling off. There is also a jacuzzi on the other side of the patio area.

The breakfast was pretty good...for the price we paid I would expect real silverware. Those two things are the only gripes. The location is perfect.

Many places looked nice, but the Orchid Key had a retro, funky vibe that set it apart from the other hotels/inns in Key West. We were extremely happy with our decision; it was fabulous!! ROOM: We had a king room, which was decorated nicely and always clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and had very soft linens. The bathroom was very modern, with a huge shower. The hotel also provides a hairdryer and shampoo/conditioner, body wash, and soap from Bath & Body Works. LOCATION: The location of the hotel is just a bonus as to how nice it is. Being that it is on the corner of Truman and Duval, it is only a short walk in any direction to great restaurants and things to do. We walked EVERYWHERE! Although the hotel is right on Duval, you would never know it. You step off of the street and it's so quiet and peaceful. GROUNDS: The hotel grounds were very pretty with fountains and lush greenery everywhere. The pool and hot tub were very nice and provided a nice relaxing area away from the craziness and crowds of upper Duval street. BREAKFAST: A continental breakfast is served at the Orchid Bar from 7-10am which includes coffee, tea, juices, cereals/milk, hard boiled eggs, fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, muffins, breads, bagels, English muffins, and french toast. BAR: For a tiny place, the Orchid Bar was sure hopping while we were there! At check-in, the front desk provided us with drink coupons (two for each day we stayed), which were good for a free glass of wine or beer (certain kinds, of course) or 50% off of well drinks during happy hour 5-7pm. Both bartenders, Betty and Michael, were great! (Thanks Michael for the tip on Antonia's... delicious!) During happy hour, the hotel provides a complimentary cheese plate with crackers and vegetables and dip, a very nice touch!

Orchid Key Inn is a small boutique property. While we were there the hotel had no children as guests and this was very nice for us. We like to sit out by a quiet pool and don't care for yelling, running, splashing, etc. The atmosphere was very relaxing. The property is on Duval St, close enough to walk down to the bars but far enough away you don't hear people or music. The street noised is dampened by several well placed water features on property. A real plus for us, the pool and jacuzzi are open 24 hours, they just ask guests to be quiet out of respect for the others staying at the Inn. We were in the jacuzzi spa both nights and it was wonderful. The room has a fridge and robes. The shower amenities are from Bath and Body Works. The towels were nice and fluffy. The sheets were not the softest and the pillows firm, but those are my only and very minor complaints. The staff was extremely customer service oriented and very friendly. They bring you towels when you are out by the pool, they call and confirm reservations, and they pick up your breakfast dishes.

Checked in with Sean and found the room to be plenty roomy enough, clean and comfortable. The room was not enormous but quaint and \"spa-like\" in decor and vibe. The room included a refrigerator, full sized coffee pot, microwave, lovely bath robes, hair dryer, fluffy towels and really nice toiletries. The large flat panel television on the wall was nice too!

Don't be fooled though, there is still lots to eat and lots to do on this end, we just found that more of the attractions/bars were on the other end though. Hotel. The hotel itself was awesome. The pictures on their website look exactly like what it looks like in person. It is very quaint and everyone is so friendly. Check in and check out was a breeze. The pool area and hot tub area were awesome. Again, pictures don't like in this case and this really looked like something out of a movie to the point where I feel like the price is really low for the hotel. Bar. The fact that you get a free drink ticket for each registered person per night is awesome in itself. It used to be that you could only use it during happy hour, but they changed it where you can go whenever the bar is open. We found this to be so much fun! Betty the bartender is AWESOME! We found it was a lot of fun to socialize with others who were staying at the hotel and to learn where everyone was from and talk. It was just so much fun. Breakfast. Despite it being a small hotel, this was probably one of the best continental breakfasts ever. They had bagels, cereal, muffins, juice, fresh fruit cups and parfaits, pasteries and the best part - a tray to take it back to your cozy bed and eat breakfast in bed! Perfect! Rooms. Speaking of cozy beds, the rooms were unbelievable. A huge t.v. (which my husband was particularly happy about when we were in the room), super comfy bed, modern and trendy decor, the bathroom was really upscale and nice as well. Again, I feel like the bang for your buck here is huge. I don't know why the prices were so cheap, but I felt like they could have gotten a lot more per night. Most rooms also overlooked the pool which was a nice way to wake up. I feel like I keep using the same word over: \"perfect\", but it really was. It was so quaint that you knew others who were staying at the hotel. You would talk about what everyone was doing for the day. The employees were just as nice if not nicer.

It felt like we were staying in a swanky spa. I even ran around taking pictures of the tile work in the bathroom, because I want to use the same design in my own home. The TV was a huge flat screen and the bed was super comfortable! The Orchid Bar was a chic place to have drinks before we went out for dinner (we got two free drink tickets when we checked in). In fact, we loved that little bar so much, we came back to it after getting bored of the Duval St. scene. The great thing about the hotel's location is that it is on Duval, but it is not in the middle of the noisy section of the street. It is quiet and relatively close to the southernmost point. I cannot say enough great things about the employees at this hotel. Like I mentioned, Shawn at the front desk was extremely helpful and accommodating. Also, we loved the bartender at the Orchid Bar! What impressed us the most was that when we got home from our trip, we could not find one of our ipods. Only four days after we got home and realized that it was missing, we got a package from FedEx. The hotel sent us the ipod we had left in our room. I could not believe the amazing guest service that this hotel delivered! If guest service is important to you, this is the place to go! If we ever venture back to Key West, I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else!", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, D.C.", "Title": "\u201cGood choice for families with older teens\u201d", "Author": "Kolomya", "ReviewID": "UR116939550", "Content": "Even in the low season, Key West is not a bargain if you need a suite.

I was tremendously wrong, and my room was right on Duval. Upon arrival, I met Brandon at the front desk. I told him of some issues I was having with the trip. He was exceptionally accommodating. His advice on attractions and restaurants was dead on. He was to be off at 10 p.m., but stayed with us until we had everyting we needed. The next morning, I went to the front desk again and met Kim. I told her that I was having a problem with a fishing reservation and felt I was getting jerked around. Within twenty minutes, she had my reservations cancelled and booked me with a different charter company, who will also get a very positive review. She even worked to get my deposit back. A trip that was heading for disaster turned out great, and I have the staff at Orchid Key to thank. The facilities are plush, clean and very modern, even for a hotel with a neon sign. The retro look works for them. It is obvious the owner spent a good deal of money to make the place as nice as it is. The pool area is small but beautiful. The bar area is also small, but the staff there are awesome as well. My Wife and I enjoyed a couple quiet evenings by the pool - and did not get bothered by the noise of Duval only a few feet away. So the facility is a way to have it all: You are right in the middle of every thing and yet still have a perfect getaway spot.

The location is perfect - just steps from the chaos of Duval Street but it's protected from all of the noise in a unique little \"eden-esque\" hideaway. Our room was amazing. Other reviews said the rooms were very small. It was perfect size for us and was immaculately clean, perfectly decorated and the attention to detail during rennovations didn't go unnoticed. We stayed in 115 which was right by the pool. The rooms have a mini fridge, a microwave, bath robes, a hair dryer and iron. My husband and I agree that we got some of the best sleep we've ever had in that bed. The drapes they use make the room completely dark, so it's almost like you lose track of time like you would on a cruise ship. Brandon provided us 6 drink tickets upon arrival, which can be used for any domestic beer or house wine during your stay when the bar is open. During the day lounging at the pool, the female front desk person brought us all ice water, which was definitely nice and unexpected. On another day, the bartender brought around samples of a frozen banana cocktail. You can't get service like that anywhere else! We would compare this place to definitely more of the high-end places we've stayed at before and paid double for, including the W Hotel in Atlanta and the Contemporary Resort at Disney World. Breakfast was also a nice touch, and included hard boiled eggs, assorted pastries, french toast, fruit, granola and yogurt cups, cereals and juice. At the pool, someone was always clearing away used towels and bringing out fresh ones. The Orchid Key by far exceeded our expectations and we were sad to leave! Traveling tip: if you have a bicycle, they do have a bike rack directly across from the check-in area.

I wanted a unique place to stay that was new, clean, comfortable, and located on Duval. Orchid Key Inn scored high on all points, so we booked a standard king room. Check in was great, we were there early so the front desk let us leave our luggage while we went to grab lunch. By the time we got back the room was ready. We were in a room just off the pool (it's a motel-style layout) and the room was new, fresh, clean and even better...freezing cold! It was so crazy hot and humid the whole weekend that a good air conditioner was a necessity, and the one in our room worked perfectly. We even snuggled up in the down comforter on the bed! Pool: Great for cooling off. We ended up staying by the pool more than we had planned (again it was just too hot) but the chairs are comfy, I loved being just steps away from my room, and since the hotel seems to cater more toward adults than kids, it was relaxing. One afternoon they even brought everyone fresh fruit smoothies to enjoy by the pool! We also liked the fact that it was open 24hrs. Maybe we were just lucky, but no one was ever in the pool at night, so we had the area to ourselves. That became our ritual: go eat a nice meal, then come back and take a leisurely night swim before drifting off to sleep. We never heard anyone at night, so pool noise was not an issue (and we were maybe 5 feet from the pool.) Again, maybe we were just lucky but all the guests were very nice and respectful of others. Orchid Bar: the bar is very cool and since they give you 2 free drink coupons a day (for beer or wine), we used them for beers by the pool. They also put out little snacks during cocktail hour (veggies, ranch dip, cheese cubes and crackers) and that was nice to enjoy by the pool. The free continental breakfast was just perfect for us, and negated the need for us to get out early and look for breakfast. They had fresh fruit, yogurt, pastries, English muffins, bagels, toast, waffles and fruit juices. Overall we loved the location of the resort (in between the loud end and the quiet end of Duval) and we were able to walk almost anywhere from there.

Brandon at the hotel was really helpful and patient, he suggested places to eat and visit which he thought would be good for us. He took the time to understand what we would like to do rather than giving a standard response, his knowledge of the island is extensive so definitely speak to him if you visit the hotel. Key West is fabulous, we wished we had stayed longer. The sunset party at the end of Duval Street should not be missed, it was breathtaking. We also had a lovely meal at 915 on Duval Street, the scallops were fab. We went to 2 beaches whilst on the island, the Fort Zacahary Beach and Higgs Beach. At Fort Zachary you have to pay to get in and then pay for sunbeds so it proved quite expensive, there was also no breeze on the beach so it was incredibly hot. It's a pretty beach though. The Higgs Beach was a lot cheaper for beds and there was a really good breeze so it made sunbathing a lot more bearable. Key West was our favourite place during our visit, its very different to the rest of the keys and should not be missed.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cypress, Texas", "Title": "\u201cFabulous!\u201d", "Author": "KatieBelle24", "ReviewID": "UR114946128", "Content": "We had a great time at the Orchid Key Inn.

Hard boil eggs, assorted breads/buns, etc., juices, coffees, pastries, bagels, etc. VERY nice hostess on duty every morning. Swimming pool, plenty of chairs/tables, drinks at poolside. In the sun. Some shade by palms in early morning and late afternoon. Hot tub/spa. Bar on premises. Closes about 10:00-ish PM. Specials daily. Rooms remodeled, marble baths with glass enclosed showers, upper end shampoos/soaps, beds comfy, 4 pillows. Air conditioning superb. We had the suite which had plenty of room and places to store clothes. Two TVs, sofa, chairs, etc. New and modern. Easy on and off of Route 1 into Key West. Denny's on corner open 24 hours if you are getting an early flight out and need breakfast. Cons: At quiet end of Duval (that's good), but a mile+ walk to the sunset viewing and main attractions. Okay if it isn't hot. But walk that a couple of times a day and the Inn gets further and further away. They offer you two comp. drinks per person and snacks between 4-6 PM. Only if you are at the Orchid Key in that two hour span can you redeem your coupons. That is really nice, but three afternoons out of four we were out in the town somewhere. Great if you like to stay in your room around that time, otherwise you kind of feel cheated out of an amenity. There is an $8.00 per day parking fee (on site). After the cost of the room per day, it should be free. The longes at pool side are really uncomfortable. They do not pull upright into a 90 degree angle which is great for reading, drinking coffee/etc. The backward slant just about breaks your back if you want to do something other that bake in the sun. Not many people (when we were there) used them. Last...there really has to be a curfew of sorts. After out all day, wanted to relax by the beautiful pool and waterfall with night lights, have a drink and just enjoy the lovely evening. Right! A group of seven people were drinking, laughing, yelling (not talking), arguing, etc. at roughly 10:00 PM. The pool sits in the C-shape alcove of the Inn and sound echos & magnifies. I felt sorry for anyone who had the rooms around the pool and were trying to relax for the night. Thank goodness our room was around the corner so when we left (after 5 minutes) we couldn't hear them. I would stay there again since the Inn was very clean and modern despite the 50's architecture. And the breakfast was not the usual Continental fare most serve. It was close to the Southern Most Point and the beach there. It just needs tweeking in regards to \"quiet hours,\" parking fees and poolside longe comfort. Otherwise, it still stands as one of the better places to stay that is affordable.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cSmall, Clean and good location\u201d", "Author": "mb2", "ReviewID": "UR114919197", "Content": "Our stay at Orchid Key Inn was pleasant.

Particularly noticable was the cheap breakfast with styrofoam cups, paper plates, and plastic utensils. Quality of the continental breakfast itself was so so but everything is pre-sweetened including the granola, cereals, and yoghurt so you might have a problem if you're not into processed foods like we are.

There is free wi-fi, free continental breakfast poolside which included hard boiled eggs, cereals, pastries, breads, fruit, yogurt, coffee, juice. They also gave us each a card for one free happy hour cocktail or beer for each day we stayed. We stayed 4 nights so we each got 4 cards and you could use them all in one night or 1 each night, or any other combo (not limited to just one per night). The happy hour also included free snacks (cheese, crackers, celery, dip). There is a fee of $8 plus tax per night for parking. The spaces were tight and the parking lot was mostly full the whole time we were there but we did always get a space. The rooms and location have been discussed here plenty, so I won't elaborate much, but we agree that the location is awesome\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6we walked everywhere! And the hotel was quiet. The rooms are a bit small. There is not a lot of space to unpack. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was great! The bathroom was stocked with Bath & Body Works products (a nice touch), a full size hair dryer and had ample counter space. There was also a mini fridge, coffee maker, microwave, safe, radio/alarm clock with dock for mp3 player, iron and ironing board. My only complaint with the room was the fact that even though the air conditioning made the room cool, it did not get the humidity out of the room. Maybe there was a different setting we were supposed to be using, but I tend to think it was just an insufficient AC for getting the humidity level down. Small complaint, but just mentioning in case they can do something about it. There is a CVS located 0.1 mi away which was great for snacks, water, sodas, etc. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful! Special shout out to Kim who was gave us lots of tips on where to go and even gave us a coupon for a free drink at Aqua for a drag show. She and Brendan were both super nice!

Every evening we would ask his opinion on where he would recommend us to go based on what we were looking for. Never once did he disappoint us with the selections. The rooms at this property are very nice and clean. The bathrooms feature a large tile shower with glass enclosure. The maid service always did a nice job everyday making up the rooms. Every morning the grounds keeper Andy would empty the trash around the whole property outside. Not only did he empty the trash bins but he went to the extent of wiping them all down on the outside each time to be sure they were clean. The property is very clean and well kept. Everywhere you look there is attention to detail. The hot tub was always clean as well as the pool. The continental breakfast that was served each morning was very nice with multiple things to choose from with a variety of options. This was not your typical continental breakfast at your average hotel, neither was the service. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody looking to stay in Key West, Florida.

My only quibble was that when we requested an extended checkout to change clothes after the 11:00 ceremony (this was the checkout time, as well), we were told that the room was reserved for the night, and they could not allow it. It worked out for us, but given the price of the room, I wish they could have accommodated us. Parking was $8 a day for the uncovered and unsecured lot.

Stayed in Key West Marriott in February, my wife and I liked the OKI experience much better. This is much closer to portion of Duval where the nightlife exists in KW, but we felt far enough away to sleep well, which we did. Must be a flat tin roof, though, because rain was a bit noisy one night. This is the quiet side of Duval, in spite of previous reviewer. We noticed almost no noise other than Harleys from the street at all hours and the morning rooster crowing. We were not directly on the street, but were closer to the center of the hotel. Room was nicely appointed, clean and the bed was outstanding....got lost in the King size. CVS is a block away for amenities, snacks, drinks, etc, and all rooms have a refrigerator (we think). Great ice cream/gellato across the street (the one beside Grand Vin, another little wine tasting gem). Tony's Cuban is right in front of hotel and was an excellent spot for cafe con leche (yum!)...didn't try the food there. We were just a couple of blocks from Bahamian Village Goombay for FF with lots of street food, drinks, items for sale, and music....a second line type band procession came by Saturday night also. We had a car, for sightseeing and driving to the wharf for various boating activity mentioned below...parking at $9/day not too bad. Marriott was twice that and you REALLY need a car there because Marriott is really not close or walking distance to anything. Loved the pool/pool area. It was small, but never crowded either, because there are not that many rooms. Evenings at poolside were just as nice, full moon, 70s and a lovely breeze. Marriott pool much bigger, but was full by 11 am most days. Brandon and Jack were both friendly and great at the front desk and have lots of good ideas regarding anything you want to do in the area. We did fishing charter (Brandon recommended great place that would cook our fish, also), snorkling tour, jet ski and parasail. Also got a great recommend from Jack on NFL Sunday (for Pats fans...Lazy Gecco). And we hit Jack Flats on the way down, who also gets the NFL Sunday Ticket Package, we met a lot of fun Ravens fans there celebrating a bachelor party and ran into them all over town the rest of the evening. We didn't spend much time in the hotel bar except for an occasional cocktail and also for breakfast, so can't tell you much about the bartenders. It was usually crowded during HH, so we got drinks and went poolside. Even though continental breakfast is served, we usually just got coffee and then had breakfast on the way to a morning boating activity....several breakfasts near Schooner Wharf (Harpoon Harry's & Pepe's).

The staff at Orchid Key were very helpful, especially Brandon and Jack. We have one complaint, and hence the four star rating instead of five stars. Even though the rooms are designated as non-smoking, our room (#108) had a strong smell of cigarette smoke, somewhat masked by cleaning products. In hindsight, we should have asked to be moved to a different room. The smell was strong, and when we got home, our luggage, clothes, purses reeked of cigarette smoke. EVERYTHING had to be laundered, and our luggage is still sitting in the garage airing out.

A short trip (just 4 nights) but very relaxing. The Inn is a single-story, recently renovated motel, but the renovation was done very nicely with pleasing retro style. Glass tiles in bathroom, marble, nice colors, furniture, art, etc. Nice amenities like robes in the room, a free in-room safe and mini-fridge, coffee maker. Everything brand new, sparkling clean and perfectly maintained. Great service by the pool. If you are lucky to be there when she is on, Siobhan will take care of you wonderfully, bringing you refreshments like a watermelon daquri cooler (yum) ! Just grab a comfy lounge chair, order a tropical blender drink and feel the stress of daily life melt away. Pool is not huge (most Key West pools are not) but it is big enough to go for a refreshing dip when it gets too hot, or good to lounge around on the wide steps in the shallow end. Pool is warm, not too chilly. There is also a nice jacuzzi whirlpool/spa with a waterfall feature, very relaxing. Grounds nicely landscaped with pleasant tropical feel. Tables with unbrelllas surround the pool area. Satisfying breakfast included with fruits, cereal, bagels, toast, english muffins, yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, juice, coffee, tea and pastries. Happy hour includes a free first drink and snacks, and discounted subsequent drinks. If you get lazy and just want to chill by the pool, you can order lunch delivered from a choice of nearby restaurants. We did this one day and it was great! Hotel is walking distance to many attractions (lighthouse, butterfly garden, beach) and many nice restaurants. We parked upon arrival and did not use the car until we left. Cabs are abundant and not too expensive. Guests are mostly upscale couples (of all types). No kids at all while we were there which we were happy about (peace and quiet at the pool all day) All in all good value for the money in Key West. Highly Recommend this place (and I am picky). See Brandon at the front desk for restaurant and tour recommendations, he is very nice and gives great advice. Great staff, very friendly and welcoming. They treat you right. If you want a great Key West getaway with no stress or problems, stay here. Only suggestion for improvement would be to use disinfectant/room freshener that is less strong, or more \"green\" . Our room smelled kind of chemically, curiously like horseradish, and the odor lingered in our clothes after we got home. It was not a big deal, but was noticable. A small blemish on an otherwise perfect stay. Recommend if you stay here you go see the butterfly garden 2 blocks away,even if you think it will be corny or cheezy - it is not, it is acually surprisingly beautiful and quite relaxing. I have been to several of these and this was the best I've seen.

The wine list is extensive with wonderfully affordable wines. The Inn is located in the most perfect location in Key West, on Duval St. and Truman, and is walking distance to absolutely everywhere. The palms and greenery on the grounds are intermingled with flowing fountains and little alcove seating areas. The rooms are gorgeous with luxury bedding and perfectly comfortable beds The marble bathrooms are filled with amenities and the shower is hugh and each room is eqluiped with a 42\" plasma TV.

We had a huge bathroom and again, it was so clean. They had wonderful thick robes and very luxurious towels. After a day out in the sun it was nice to come back to a cool and comfy room. The fridge did freeze some of our drinks, but again, after a day in the sun a Diet Coke slushee was delish! We had no trouble finding a good place to eat and drink as we were in the middle of Duval. Yet the minute we walked up the drive it was very quiet and relaxing. Yes, the breakfast they serve is very basic, but for my husband and I, it was perfect. I would go out to the Orchid Bar and pick up something for the both of us and we would have a breakfast in bed while planning the day.

The breakfast is served in this area, and it was relaxing starting our day here. Many choices for breakfast, including different breads, spreads, yogurt, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs. Being that we were staying almost a full week, we were given the offer of letting them know if we had any special requests. We did not take advantage of this offer, but it was much appreciated, anyway. Coffee could be stronger! Afternoon wine and snacks at Almond Tree down the street was nothing great. Only went one time. We stayed in a King suite and it was very large and well-appointed. Very clean. As one other reviewer mentioned, upon entering the room, there was a strong cleaning solution odor, but this dissipated quickly, and I actually forgot about it unitl I read the other review just now. The bed was really comfortable and the blackout shades worked perfectly. One minor issue; there was no clock in the bedroom! Small inconvenience. And again, as others have mentioned, crowing roosters abound and tend to wake the lighter sleepers at around 5AM. Can't really avoid this Key West idiosyncracy! Noise from the street was negligible. Location was great, but a little far to walk to some locations. We walked to beach at Ft. Zach, but were so thankful to have caught a pedi-cab by chance on the way back. Also walked to Mallory Sq., but again, preferable to get some kind of ride back, depending on how tired your legs are! Brandon was super and we enjoyed getting to know him. He steered us in the right direction for activities and made the reservations for us. Fishing on the Gulfstream IV, and sunset cruise on Danger Charters, not to be missed. Two of the highlights of our trip. If you want to keep your catch and have it prepared at a local restaurant, it is not as easy as some would have you believe. We found Dante's in the historic marina will do it. I would suggest at least one meal at El Siboney (cuban) and surprisingly good roast pork at Rumba's on Duval. Overall, it was a great trip.

Every employee of this inn was helpful and friendly. As others have mentioned, Brandon was super helpful. When we asked for a restaurant recommendation, he not only made a suggestion, but gave us the whole history of the place. Then he (and others also) would reach into their big drawer, pull out a business card for the place, and an offer for a free drink or other discount for the place. The location is perfect for a true taste of Key West. Our last stay, we stayed on the western side, which had luxury hotels on the water and a younger crowd. It was fine, but we felt more at home at the Orchid Key and on the eastern side. Every single place we ate, we enjoyed: Black Fin (red grouper and yellow tail snapper and bananas foster--wow), Abbondanza, Blue Heaven, nine one five were all great. For lunch, the Southernmost Beach Cafe right on the Atlantic is good. The Inn offers breakfast each morning, but one morning we walked to the Flamingo and I had the freshest scrambled eggs. Croissants de France was also good, and their chocolate croissants are a real treat; we stopped and bought some on our way home from the Duvall Crawl one evening. Tried a lot of key lime pie, but my favorite was from the Key Lime Pie Factory--not too sweet, and a traditional crust. The meringue has bits of key lime zest on top--mmmm. And Sunday Champagne brunch at La Te Da is so charming. On the western side, we had a seafood appetizer at the Westin Bistro (Mallory Square) that was huge and juicy. When going to Mallory Square, be sure to check out the guy with the homemade pretzels--AWESOME, and he has 50 different kinds of mustard. Also on that end of the island, try lunch at Sunset Pier; the crispy crab sandwich was yummy. We had a wonderful week and the Orchid Key Inn was a large part of that. It's a quiet place to relax in the morning with breakfast, or take a nap at the pool in the afternoon before heading out later.

The Orchid Key Inn got great reviews, and the price was right, so we decided to check it out. We had an extremely nice stay in a deluxe king room, which had a separate sitting area room with a couch, and a chair, and a second flat screen tv (in addition to the one in the bedroom area). I really liked the nouveau-retro d\u00c3\u00a9cor, although I have to admit I guess I missed some of the more tropical flavor we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d had during previous stays at pricier b&b- type places. There was also a small fridge (which sadly froze all of our beer) and a microwave (which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use). The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever slept on--we slept amazingly during our stay. Some of the previous reviewers commented on how small the rooms were, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that was an issue at all with ours. So spring for a deluxe if you go. The issues we did have were minor, but still worth mentioning. Housekeeping came wayyyy too early (as others have observed) and there didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to be any \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd signs. This was kind of annoying, especially after a night of crawling Duval Street, and you knew that knock on the door was coming. We had to ask the front desk for more toilet paper-- housekeeping kept forgetting to refill. Or maybe we just use a lot of toilet paper, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. Catastrophic? No. Annoying? A little. On the day before we checked out, housekeeping didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite finish making our bed, and left it like that. Again, not a big deal, just kind of odd. The wireless connection was spotty (but the hardwired one in the room worked fine). The room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s marble floors became an ice skating death rink when we happened to enter after being out in the rain. There were no ceiling fans, which just seemed weird in the tropics, and I would think would ultimately save on cooling costs, since we like it cool when we sleep, and cranked the air to compensate. We had to ask the front desk for towels every time we went to the pool. Why not leave them in the room, or make them available by the pool? The very comfy lounge chairs get roasting hot in the sun, so I had to stand around waiting-- again, minor complaints. And speaking of the office staff\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see the mythic Brandon until checkout, and he was wonderfully friendly, cheerful, and helpful, just as everyone else had pointed out. The rest of the office staff we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d encountered can best be described as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153coldly and politely efficient\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd-- not so unlike the marble floor in our room. Luckily, we knew where we were going and what we were doing, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really need them. As for the bar not being open, we knew about it beforehand, and made sure to stock the aforementioned beer slushies in our room fridge. We had a wonderful vacation, and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really spend all that much time in the room anyway-- but it was super clean, in a good location, and had the best bed ever. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure, though, if we would return-- my husband and I ultimately prefer a place, if possible, with a small private deck or a patio, to sip coffee and read the paper in the morning, and have drinks in the afternoon. But that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s personal preference, and would not prevent me from recommending the Orchid Key Inn as a very, very good place to stay in Key West.", "Date": "January 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mokena, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Sharen210", "ReviewID": "UR54438166", "Content": "Just returned from a wonderful visit to Key West.

I've stayed all over the island - the west end of Duval, in some of the neighborhood areas, etc - and I enjoyed this spot the most. It's on Duval, easy walking and biking distance to everything but far enough from the chaos and noise of the west end to be relaxing. Room - on the small side but very clean, very well designed - clearly had been recently renovated and to a high standard with huge shower, recycled glass tile, composite vanity, rich dark woods, modern contemporary fixtures, flat panel HDTV on the wall, safe in the armoire for a laptop and other valuables, small fridge, small microwave, well sound insulated (we faced the pool and could barely tell when people were passing right outside the door), nice bath products, plenty of towels. It was a bit tight but we didn't spend much time in the room. If we had had a lot of luggage and dive gear, it might have been more difficult. Lots of nice well thought design details - like having the shower control near the door so you could get the water going and warm without getting wet. Three small design misses - the spigot on the vanity faucet extends too far over the bowl, add a dimmer to the bathroom lights and there's no ceiling fan, which would be nice to circulate the air without keeping the AC on. (the separate exhaust fan above the toilet and shower area is a plus) Service - terrific - we arrived early and our room was ready, we had a late flight and they accommodated a later check out and then held our bags after that. Great recommendations for restaurants (Jack suggested Michael's which was a hidden local's place for our anniversary dinner), bike rentals, water activities and coupons for a lot of it! Take advantage of their local knowledge. Pool area - big enough for the relatively light number of guest while we were there but I could imagine it could be crowded if the inn is full. Pool is nicely designed with a sun shelf and a small hot tub with waterfall wall. There is no operating bar at this time, so no boat drinks or even a beer while sitting by the pool unless you bring your own - this was a big disappointment. Breakfast/Happy Hour - this was probably the only let down - breakfast was ok - similar to what you find at a Holiday Inn Express, except the HI has hot items. There were bagels, cold cereal, small powdered donuts, muffins, apples, bananas, hard boiled eggs. This could easily be upgraded and make a big difference. The happy hour was the biggest disappointment - see pool/bar comment above - no liquor license yet (how long has the Inn been open? Oct 2008!) They have some decent wines displayed on the non-operational bar wall, but these are not what is offered during happy hour across the street, where happy hour takes place, at the Almond Tree Inn, a sister property. The low-end selections offered didn't fit the otherwise high-end experience of the Orchid Key. There's no excuse for this property not to have an operating bar and to be able to serve drinks poolside - this should be disclosed, since The Orchid Bar is even listed as the 2nd amenity on their own amenity list on their website. Wifi - free, in room, worked great Parking - seemed to be plenty available for a fee - we don't bother with a car while on island so can't comment beyond that it looks to be available.

The color clearly someone who enjoys modern interior decorating had fun with these rooms - loved the blues/greens and the shapes. The shower was large and modern, I was just impressed that it didn't look like an old worn out hotel room. The bar area (below the HDTV mounted on the wall) was large, with a small hidden fridge available that was convenient. Loved the iHome iPod/iPhone dock to recharge my phone. :) The room was cozy - big enough for 2 people for 1 night, but not a place to 'hang out'. The location of the Orchid is awesome - centrally located right on the main drag (I forget the name of the road) but far enough away to not hear all the ruckus from the drunk party-goers. :) We walked everywhere. The hotel had a happy hour with free wine, beer and snacks. The pool was small, but the lounge chairs were awesome - and they provided extra towels - already rolled up on the chaise lounges, waiting to be used.
