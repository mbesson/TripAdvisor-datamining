The hotel was quirky and staff was really nice. About 10- 15 min walk to the nearest metro. Our room was little small but very clean and with super comfy bed. All rooms are painted black, which is super cool but it's little dark and I think because of that I missed my watch when we were leaving. My boyfriend e-amiled them and asked if they found my watch but the answer was NO, so that was little disappointing. We had Kiehl's products in the bathroom with the smell of coriander, really nice touch. As soon as we came back to London I purchased the very same shower gel. Restaurant in the hotel does really nice meals and staff was really friendly and all english speaking. We are both pizza lovers and recommend you trying one of their pizzas. At night, you can visit their bar that serves amazing cocktails.

In total I have spent already a couple stays there. The Mama Shelter was built I guess in 2008 or so and is kind of a brand new hotel in Paris. It is kind of a budget design hotel. You can have a room for something like 80 EUR per night, which is something like a little miracle in Paris. Normally 80 EUR leads you to a hostel, old crapy place or to the brunch buffet at one of the Grand Hotels in Paris. The look of the hotel is very fresh and perfectly hit my taste. The rooms are a bit cosy but pretty standard suze for Paris. All rooms are equipped with an iMac, which is also the TV or radio station or in room \"photo camera\" (you can shoot pic's and upload them into the public photo album so evrybody is able to see it). The lamps beside you bed are actually masks of comic hero's like batman etc which you can actually wear. This is one of the popular motives with in the public album - guest with these masks covering their faces... and sometime without cloth :). Only thing that could be improved are the bathrooms, they are missing a bit the freshness and details of the bedroom. The Restaurant and the Bar are the absolute Highlights. They are designed by Philip Starck and are one of the coolest Places in Town. Its hard to descriebe it briefly, you just have to check out the pictures. The whole section is divided into three to four parts. Pizza bistro, restaurant, Bar and further restaurant or in the morning breakfast area. It is very busy nearly every day of the week. A lot french people visit the place which maes it even better as it is not a pure tourist spot. The quality of the food is pretty descent but nothing spectacular, it's a mixture of french and internationl cuisine. So you shouldn't expect a 3 star dish or cosy french dish and you wont be dissapointed. The Service in general is also ok. I have no bad experience nor something exceptionally positive. Locationwise the hotel might seem to be a bitt off the main road which it actually is to a certain extent. Located at the 20est arondissment it is close to the east border of paris (the peripherique) and therefore well connected to the airport CDG. The next Metro is Gambetta and located a 5-10 minute walk. Genrally speaking within 20 minutes you can be in central Paris nonetheless whether you choose to take a cab or the metro. The area itself is not overwhelming but is an emerging spot for you people. You will maybe find a couple nice shops, bars, restaurants etc but not too much. Summarizing the long stroy... 80 for such a Hotel ist really good. Would love to have more places like that in more towns. It's a well done product!", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Odiham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201ctrying to be boutique but forgetting the service...\u201d", "Author": "markandphilippa", "ReviewID": "UR124872596", "Content": "this is an unusual hotel that I visited whilst on business.

The staff go out of their way to make everyone feel comfortable, welcome, and at home ... despite being a large hotel, it is serene and quiet in the rooms (affording a great opportunity to work if needed). My wife commented on this last trip how she felt that everyone working at the hotel was young and vibrant, while still being very courteous and professional - I totally agree. Guests feel relaxed and at ease. The rooms continue to be fantastic - small, clean, great internet/tv/movies, a large and bright bathroom with nice products. There is a laundry if needed, taxis can be called at a moment's notice, and for those of us who love to ride, there is a Velib station directly across from the hotel. Although lacking a gym, there is a Club Med Gym two blocks away where one can purchase a day pass. One of the other fantastic benefits of this hotel is the restaurant and bar. A delicious and fresh menu prevails, with a great wine and beverage selection. When working I customarily sit at the bar and have a quick, late dinner - the service is always attentive and fun and SUPER quick if need be - while the food is always delicious and beautifully presented. We salute the Mama team for all that they do - I always feel like a special guest at this hotel, which feels distinctly 'un-Parisian', yet offers the very best that Paris can be!

I travel to Paris frequently for work; in fact, at one point I was traveling there several times a month. I usually stay at the Westin Paris (as a Starwood platinum member), however my company wanted me to find a less expensive option, so I looked into Mama Shelter. I had heard about it through a design magazine, and saw that it was a Philippe Starck hotel, which appealed to me -- my apartment in NY is Philippe Starck designed, so I'm obviously a fan of his work. The place looked like it was modern and well appointed, especially with Starck's trademark whimsy, so I figured it would be worth a shot, especially considering the low prices. What a mistake. I arrived on a late flight (around 11pm local time) and was pleased at first when I arrived; there was a bit of a crowd at the downstairs bar and it seemed like a nice enough place. I checked myself in, and went up to my room... that's where it all went downhill. The first thing I noticed was that there was NO OVERHEAD LIGHTING in the room at all, or any other kind of substantial lamp. The only available light was from the small desk lamp, the computer, and the two stupid superhero-mask lamps on either side of the bed (none of which provided anywhere near enough light to see anything in the room). So I'm stumbling around this pitch-black room with my suitcases after getting off of a five-hour flight and 30 minute cab ride, with no way to even see well enough to begin to unpack. Awesome. Next thing I notice is that there is NO MINIBAR OR ROOM SERVICE. So it's now midnight and I'm starving and pretty much screwed, as the only way I'm going to eat will be to trek out into the Paris streets and find a cafe, when all I really want is to have a quick bite and go to sleep. Onward, I then realize that there is also NO TELEVISION. Yes, there is an iMac computer, which they have set up as sort of an all-in-one entertainment solution. It's not. It's indecipherable, particularly in the pitch black of your room, and the screen is also tiny and nowhere near loud enough to be of any real use. Most people these days travel with their laptops, but nobody I know travels with a television. While it's apparently a cool thing to write on your website that every room has an iMac computer, it's pretty much useless in a practical sense. And finally, when I booked my room, the hotel was offering a promotion which included a free bottle of champagne at check in, which I opted for. Except what they provided was NOT REAL CHAMPAGNE. In Paris. France. I didn't even know that was possible. Needless to say that I was completely livid. I spent about an hour in my room before leaving in absolute disgust at around 1am. I went down to the front desk, cancelled my five-day reservation and took a taxi over to the Westin, where I could at least get a steak (and not need a flashlight to see it), then watch a movie before bed on an actual television. Yes, it was quadruple the price, but worth every single Euro at that point. They advertise this hotel as a cool boutique experience, but it is not. It is an economy hotel with some design sensibility thrown in. If your choice is between this and a youth hostel, then I guess it's a better choice.

Considering the price of the rooms and the type of hotel (and that they advertise their rooms as having Khiels toilletries as a selling point of the room) it was dissapointing.

There are no tea/coffee making equipment (spoons/mugs/tea) so again, we had to buy our own. It just seemed odd to have a microwave full-stop. I would definitely stay here again.

I stayed there on Saturday Feb 12. After an exhausting day walking around the city, I wanted to curl up in my bed and sleep. When i first entered Mama Shelter, i was immediately greeted by the warm check-in staff and the decor. What a chic and posh lobby!! :) The check-in staff was really attentive by giving me a quick overview of Mama Shelter. She explained the in-house restaurant closing hours and menu options. She informed me of an event that was happening at the restaurant with live DJ music and highly recommended to make a reservation if I was going to dine in. She then walked me to the elevator and explained which floor I was going to stay. This was a nice touch to have so much personal attention to a solo guest at the hotel. The room: entering the hallway to my room, you are greeted by abstract carpets and colourful walls. The lights turn on automatically as you walk through the hallway. I enter my room and was blown away by the size, amendities and wall to ceiling windows. The iMac was great to perform iChat, free movies, TV and acts as my alarm clock too. The bed was perfect - hard and soft pillows. The key was the free wifi. The signal was so strong that I had a 1hour conversation to my family in Toronto, Canada via Skype. I was very impressed. Restaurant: I grabbed some takeaway from the in-hotel restaurant (pizza and salad). As i was waiting for my takeway, i occupied a table to wait. I was informed by the waiter that the table was needed for some other customers. Not a problem here as the waiter grabbed me a chair and offered me a drink on the house for moving and waiting for my takeway. Tres cool!

Obviously there's more people than I thought ready to forgive bad service as long as the place looks cool. Indeed the design is very nice, hip and trendy: lots of black, Mac screen on your room (you have to pay a deposit at reception if you want to use as PC), bathroom very neat, top quality toiletteries(only shower gel and shampoo though), beds are good. But quoting Philippe Starck himself, \"Everything I designed was unnecessary\", the room is full of silly lighting that doesn't really illuminate (putting make-up on at night is a challenge :-)), you have to look for long before finding the right light switch, the room started to smell like cigarettes if you turned the airco on, not to mention the toilet paper holder was installed uncorrectly, so every time you pull the paper, the rol flew the other side of the bathroom to land under the shower. There's a water cooker in the room, but you have to bring your own tea or coffee because there's none. When calling reception to ask for drinks that were not replaced in our mini bar, we were told that's normal, because the company that fills the minibars comes once a week! No, there's no room service. Internet at the \"business centre\" (two computers next to reception) was very slow, and one of the PC's actually didn't work. There's two special desks for your flights check-in, but connection is so slow that you may as well just do the line at the airport: seriously, it wook almost one hour to my friend flying to Canada to get her boarding passes printed. So service is basically inexistent at Mama Shelter, once you enter the hotel, you're on your own. Checking in took for ever: the girl (I don't think anyone among the personnel is older than 23) that checked me in had a lot of trouble to understand that I was with a group of friends that had already checked in and kept insisting I should get a newly booked room that wasn't mine. At the bar/restaurant, things didn't go better. Waiters don't come spontaneously to ask if you want anything, you have to call them, I realized after half hour sitting there. Once they finally got my order, it took 45' to bring carrots with a dipping sauce! I was curious how long it would take if I had asked something that involved cooking... When my friends joined for more drinks, things didn't get better. The waiter kept coming back and asking again what we wanted because he never got the order right, so some got their drinks half hour later than the rest. At this point, some had enough and left to dine somewher else. Those who staid regreted it: the pasta we order was overcooked and just about edible and served in a cacerole (all portions together) which the waiter just left on the table. Not only he wouldn't serve the plates, he took the top of the cacerole with him and he didn't even leave a spoon, so he left us there with the pasta cooling down while we tried to put it on the plates with fork and knife. At this point we were reminding the waiter for the 3rd time of the bottle of wine we had ordered. By the 5th time, no wine yet and thirsty, we just paid and left to have our drinks somewhere else. Those reviews mentioning the brunch and breakfast is excellent astonish me: food is just OK, but price-quality relation is not balanced. If you want to enjoy a proper brunch in a Paris hotel, try the Kube hotel in the 18e arrondissement. Yes, the bar is very cool too and the locals visiting are also cool looking people, but Paris is big enough to find other cool and expensive places where you can actually have good food AND decent service. If you had a busy day and would like to sleep, you won't before 2am: the noise and music from the bar won't let you. For a Paris hotel it is not expensive, but for hostel service quality it is. I did have a great time and fun with my friends in Paris, but the hotel didn't add much to that.

It's more upmarket than you're traditional French bistro but it's all well prepared, great for ambience and if you're waiter is a little surly, it's nothing to do with the place. If you've been to Paris before, lived there, know the place then meander and explore a different quartier without being ripped off in tourist cafes and listening to droning tourist accents bang on about Baudelaire, even though he's genius. Though you may hear those accents close by as you visit Jim Morrison's grave in nearby Pere la Chaise. Beware though not all crowds around a gravestone are there because someone is famous, some are actually attending a funeral!! You need to walk a little for a Metro stop, but isn't that the beauty of Paris that you can... anyway if you're visiting why you not walking anyway or using a more eco friendly Velob!! And you you're a business man hail a cab on the corner and give your receipt to the company if you're in that much of a rush!! I could say something like prior preparation and slow down but I'll decline... I love this hotel.... off the beaten track and an excellent opportunity to explore a city I love in a fun, affordable way.... I saw someone complain about the fact there was only liquid soap but it's Kiehls and usually deliciously refined and exotic smelling.... so much lovelier than the usual hotel stuff smelling of Men's cologne! Lastly play with the masks and find a new side to yourself!

The location is not ideal, but there's plenty to explore for the more adventurous. On the other hand, for what I would rate 4.5 star quality accommodation in Paris, the price cannot be beat! If this is your first trip to Paris, do not stay here. You will not get a romantic view out your window, no cute boulangeries and flower shops and art galleries around. The metro stop is a 10-15 minute walk, then you need to make connections to get to most places, and although the bus takes you from the doorstep to the Louvre, it's still a 40-minute ride. However, if this is not your first trip to Paris, you're young (or young at heart), and would like to go off the beaten path, then this is the place for you! Rooms are small, but exquisitely furnished (it is Philippe Starck after all), great fun with the plastic masks dubbing as bedside lamps. There's free wi-fi everywhere and an iMac in every room, complete with free on-demand movies, tips on points of interest in the area and an ibooth: you can take pictures from the iMac, e-mail them to yourself, and perhaps have them screened at the restaurant downstairs. Great fun! The d\u00e9cor is really trendy, with artwork everywhere, on the carpets, ceilings, lift. The whole black theme makes the place a bit dark, so perhaps more suited for a winter trip to Paris, although the rooftop terrace is night on a cool evening. We stayed in the 5th floor, and although we could hear music from the bar, it closed fairly early, around 1:00AM on weekends, so not too much trouble. Reception were quick to check us in, and equally efficient to change our room when, after walking in detecting a strong stale cigarette smoke in the room. Bathroom was very nice, with good rain shower and Kiehl's toiletries. Towels were changed every night, without having to request. The hotel bar/restaurant is a hotspot, and you are advised to book for every meal in advance. Menu is small, but very nice, brunch was superb (see separate restaurant review). No complaints, really, only a few minor quibbles, like not enough staff at reception at checkout time, area around shower gets a little wet, etc... People looking for a more classic hotel experience might not appreciate this place.

We enjoyed the leafy rooftop terrace which has a ping pong table, canvas sling chairs, and two lounge beds. The hotel is far from the main tourist areas of the city. You might want to think about this when considering the hotel because of the amount of time you will spend on the metro.

What an incredible experience it was! From the very beginning, working with Amel at reservations was easy ... she was quick and responsive, and when I explained that I would be working during my stay (and that quiet at night was important), she assured me that my room would provide a respite. Upon arrival at the hotel, I was greeted with warmth at reception, and was told that my room was ready for me, despite my very early arrival at the hotel (11 am). My 'single' room (actually, a full size bed) was booked at the lowest rate available - 79 EUR per night. What a great value! I was located on the 7th (top) floor of the hotel, adjacent to the beautiful (and very underused/private) roof terrace! A bright sunny room awaited, immaculate and spotless - perfect and consistent and high speed wifi, the imac TV, very cool surroundings, a great bathroom, and most importantly, total quiet (thanks also to concrete walls). The room could not have been more perfect, with large windows to the sunny exterior. The service at the hotel was amazing ... I always felt that I was staying at a small 'boutique' hotel, not a large hotel (which Mama Shelter actually is). The generosity of spirit at the reception was incredible - never frazzled, always relaxed, helpful, kind, patient. A continuation of the initial contact with Amel and the reservations department. By the way, any 'hiccup' that I encountered or any request put forth (few, as everything was near perfect!!!) was responded to IMMEDIATELY - not in half an hour, with another call, but AT THAT MOMENT. Hard to believe such good service still exists! Another huge plus is the restaurant - after being out all day, returning at 10:30, it was great (particularly as a solo traveler) to be able to change and go downstairs the the vibrant, loud, fun, lively restaurant and have dinner at the bar. The food is excellent, service is quick, the bartenders and servers are fantastic, and it makes for a great way to end the day. You can even connect to the wifi there to check up on things if need be. There's a small laundry if needed, very convenient for longer stays. In a fabulous city that has great hotels for huge sums, it is difficult to find a hotel that offers good value for money; and forget about great service and amenities. Mama Shelter bucks the trend by offering all of that and MORE! There is no gym at the hotel, but day passes and monthly passes can be purchased at the neighboring Club Med Gym just down the street - very convenient (note: almost no hotels in Paris have gyms!) This hotel is a perfect place for the design oriented who have been to Paris before. For those arriving for a first time visit, it may be difficult to 'get' the location, which is perfect for those that are not put off by being a bit outside of St. Germain, etc.. But the hotel is close enough to Bastille, Marais, etc. - particularly if you are on bike, as I was.

Loved almost everything about our stay at Mama Shelter. Yes the location leaves a lot to be desired (its about a 10 minute walk from the nearest metro) but its worth the walk. The hotel does not look like much from the outside but as you approach it from the street you get a glimpse of the restaurant and you know that it is something special. Yes the hotel does look like a car park from the outside (which it was) but just wait and see what is lurking behind the doors. Everything in this hotel is the work of someone special. The detail is beyond reproach. The amount of detail is unquestionable, which makes it hard to pack everything into a review. The staff were very helpful. We arrived at the hotel a little early though and our room was not ready (we requested a room on a higher floor as to avoid any noise.... this is our thing!!) we were able to leave out luggage and arranged to come back later to check in correctly. We arrived back at the hotel and we were given our luggage, the lift was called for us and we were told to have a nice stay. The lift was bright pink, with lots of random quotes on the wall.... very designer. The corridor to the room was quite dark, but again this added to the whole atmosphere. Once we got to out room we found almost everything to be perfect (a few things a miss but more on that later). So the room was fairly small, but compared to other rooms in Europe this is pretty standard, and with being from the UK we are more than use to it. The lighting in the room was fairly low and again this all adds to the atmosphere. There was a Mac on the wall of the bed room and this was used for the TV/Radio/Internet etc, the range of channels was pretty standard and we had to leave a deposit with reception to gain a keyboard for the internet. Wifi was free and easy enough to log onto with our iphones. The bed was big and the pillows were full, very good quality bedding and had a fantastic nights sleep. The bathroom was clean and light with lots of space. The shower was lovely and powerful. the only thing missing was a robe, and there was no soap! We would stay here again the price was good and the location was not enough to put us off! There is a lots of road works outside the hotel. But again we didn't hear any of this once in the hotel. Only bad point are: when we tried to book into the restaurant we were told that is was fully booked. As in the whole restaurant. We were not told by reception that it gets busy and we were not asked if we wanted to book on arrival. In the rooms there was a kettle but no cups/refreshments.

One other poster pointed this out as well - I prefer to move under the radar most of the time, minding my own business. I've lived in central Paris and make regular visits and (I think) relatively low maintenance, so I prefer to be left alone by the staff. I felt well served (see exception below) and was impressed with the decor. I'm usually not high on the arty-design hotel stuff, and think it's mostly just an excuse to overcharge, but the atmosphere in this hotel worked for me. The room was cool. Small... but cool. If you want room to move around, then book a suite or else you'll be disappointed. The Mac TV is cool. The room was quiet and the bed was the most comfortable I've had in Paris. The Kiehl products are a nice touch for the wife, and Bar is well worth a night (even if you don't stay here). The location is good if you are either exploring the 20th (Pere Lachaise is nearby) or you are okay with Public Transit. The metro is a bit of a walk (not far, but I wouldn't want to walk it in the rain). Getting to the centre of Paris is easy, though. The line 76 bus runs right in front of the hotel and connects via Rue Charonne/Pl. Bastille/Rue St. Antoine and follows Rue Rivoli through to the Louvre in about 25mins that goes by quickly. You can get out at Bastille or Chatelet to connect to the rest of the City without a problem. Reception Staff was a mixed bag. When asking the lady at the desk about the best way to get to the airport on a weekday afternoon, the staff appeared to be a little more fashion than function - had I been new to the city, the answer would have thrown me a bit. Although the guy on duty the night we arrived seemed well aware of the restaurants within walking distance. The free internet in the reception area was also useful (for things like planning a trip to the airport). The one downer for me was the service in the resto/cafe. We were ignored for a while as we settled in for a coffee before heading out for the afternoon - I got the feeling some minor crisis was happening behind the scenes, but still how hard is it ask if we need a menu or just drinks?

The worst however was clearly the location. Unless you have business in the area, i recommend against staying there. You will pay EUR10-20 taxi fare to the main sites in Paris. Public transport is limited with the exception of a bus that leaves every 15 mins. The neighborhood is very local, rather suburban, nothing to do, nothing to look at (our deluxe room view was to the rail road tracks). For the price you pay at Mama Shelter, stay in 3-star downtown and visit the bar/restaurant once on your trip to not miss out on the unquestionably Starck touch.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cAmazing fun, unique and quirky hotel, would definitely recommend for a short stay!\u201d", "Author": "CSMM82", "ReviewID": "UR49974879", "Content": "Would definitely recommend staying here, it's a funky location in East Paris, a bit out of the way from the central tourist areas yes but there is a metro just a short walk away.

I had stumbled across the Mama Shelter website when reading about hotel design, and decided to book two nights for my trip to Paris. The price was very reasonable (less than the Marriotts or Hiltons I had researched), and seemed to offer some great amenities for the value. I arrived in Paris via train from London, and took the Metro from Gare Du Nord station to Porte De Bagnolet, which was the nearest station to the Mama Shelter. As other guests have pointed out, the property is not in the center of Paris, and it is a bit of a walk (I'd say 15-20min. from the metro station). However, while the area looks like it would be \"shady,\" I found there were some great restaurants, shops, and incredibly friendly people you pass on the walk to the hotel. Checking-in at the Mama Shelter was easy as can be, and while I would not say those working the front desk are perfectly fluent in English, they certainly speak more than enough to provide information about the hotel and how to get around. I was given a room on the second floor (both the front door to the hotel and the elevator are accessible by room key), and found my room to be very comfortable. The bathroom included a very nice shower, heated towel rack, and lovely amenities; the bedroom had a unique design with a very comfortable bed and functional work-space. Above the desk was a large iMac computer, which was controlled via remote. This could be used to watch TV, movies, browse the web, or find out information regarding the hotel and local area. You can also ask the front desk for a wireless keyboard to use with the computer (you just are required to put down a deposit in case it is broken), but the rental cost is free. Additionally, the lobby includes two iMac computers that are free to use. Since I did not dine or use the bar in the hotel, I cannot comment on the quality of food, though both nights the bar and restaurant seemed incredibly popular. Near the hotel were a few bars/nightclubs as well as restaurants, so if a trip into the center of Paris wasn't your ideal evening, you would not need to go very far at all. Additionally, I will comment that the staff at the Mama Shelter were very friendly and fun to chat with, and made a guest truly feel welcome. So as long as a short trek to the nearest metro isn't a problem, the Mama Shelter is a fun, unique property at a great price. I highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rancho Palos Verdes, CA", "Title": "\u201cMama Mia!\u201d", "Author": "citrusboy", "ReviewID": "UR46201670", "Content": "Stayed here during fashion week and the place was crawling with models and fashion execs all week.

So far we have good value, cleanness, original design and obliging staff. And this point, I can see you asking, what is wrong with this hotel? Right. I could have lived with the location, very far from the centre and in a rather run-down part of town, and with the lack of natural (and otherwise) light in the room. I could have also happily lived with some of the quite odd elements of the room, such as the bizarre lamps/torches covered in masks and other less annoying but equally incomprehensible features: a kettle but no cups and a microwave but no crockery or cutlery.

I watched the hand of a stranger leave my jacket pocket, without my wallet, fortunately. Alternatively, you can take the bus, right outside the hotel. I liked the whole vibe in Paris, including the barmy weather! I'll be going back to Mama, for sure!", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cBest deal in Paris!\u201d", "Author": "WoosterLad", "ReviewID": "UR31593493", "Content": "When my travel editor friend told me about Mama Shelter, I checked out the Web site and was pleasantly surprised to find 89 Euro per night deals (for two people) for a weekend visit in late-May. I have to admit that I was skeptical about the rate and was sure the real thing wouldn't match up to the pictures and the hype when I got there. I was pleasantly surprised when I was proven wrong. The location in the 20 e was indeed towards the edge of the city but I was prepared for it. From the moment we got to the hotel, our experience was nothing but pleasant. The staff was friendly and efficient, the decor fun and whimsical and the mood of the place light and jovial. Our room was tiny but for those prices, I didn't expect more. Soon after we got to our room though, we realized that the air conditioning and keyboard to the complimentary mac TV system didn't work. Not only did the hotel technician offer us a regular size key board, the front desk immediately moved us to a larger room, as no other rooms in our category were available. To add to it, the next day, the receptionist informed me that they would be offering us a 50 percent discount off the first night's rate for our inconvenience. The room was large enough, the bathroom was modern and clean and the beds were some of the most comfortable ones I've slept on. The theme throughout the rest of our stay was similar. The only exception was while having an early-evening drink at the outdoor terrace adjacent to the main restaurant, when service was very slow. We sat at the bar and had drinks and food there. By 10pm, the whole place was hopping and realizing that we had choice spots, we didn't vacate our seats until after 2am. We kept on ordering tasty libations from our friendly and talented bartender Joe. The restaurant and bar certainly hosted some of the hottest people in Paris that night. Check out on Sunday was just as seamless as check in on Friday. Mama Shelter is a sure winner for travelers looking for a relatively-cheap hotel in Paris without compromising on western comforts and amenities they may be used to in the United States.", "Date": "June 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, UK", "Title": "\u201cFunky hotel but spoilt by thieves and bad management\u201d", "Author": "Elvisisdog", "ReviewID": "UR30935167", "Content": "The Mama Shelter looks the part, although the surrounding streets do look a little run down, venture too far from the hotel and you can feel very uncomfortable very quickly if you choose the wrong direction. Anyway back to the hotel. It's new, with fresh styling and very helpful desk staff. The rooms are a little cramped (but they tell you this on the website) and the bar and restaurant look fantastic. As other reviews have said, the price of drinks and food in the hotel are high (higher than central Paris restaurants) but the food and service are excellent. The down-side, unfortunately while we were out the maid decided to help herself/himself to the contents of my wallet, you wouldn't expect to need to use a safe in a hotel where you need a room key to operate the lifts and have to use 2 lifts to get to the 7 floor. This was very disappointing. The desk staff were very helpful but the management just didn't care, after proving only myself and the maid had been in the room the managing director stated that no further action would be taken. The police weren't interested and gave me a crime report to register in the UK. Unfortunately this wasn't the only occurrence; other friends in the hotel had come back to their room to find their door open (fortunately only small amounts of cash missing). Why did I leave my wallet in the room - I was running the Paris marathon, it wasn't really practical to run with it. Lesson learned - just a shame that a hotel with the aspirations of the mama shelter has stooped this low. On a side note - there is a bouncer on the door in the evening - this may give you a hint to the type of area you are in. The bar/club across the road is very popular, but expect there to be a moderate amount of noise in the evening of the weekends.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Europe", "Title": "\u201cJuggling plates and dropping a few\u201d", "Author": "snwo", "ReviewID": "UR30100849", "Content": "This hotel gets good marks on several points, such as cleanliness and decor, but as is the case with many other things, its not quite the full deal; not everything is given the same attention that is deserves.

My advice to (potential) guests, this is a good hotel at a good price but dont expect to be in the center.

Would you want to plug your shaver into the only other socket in the bathroom, which is underneath a radiator and facing a window? I don't. Why does this hotel also not provide soap in the toilet? Or mugs to actually drink from - given they provide a kettle? or cutlery to eat with, given they provide a microwave? Why are there on mirrors in Room 629 when our friends had threee huge mirrors in there room?? Why did the cleaners insist on leaving our Television on each day? Why do the hotel employ such rude waiting staff? We need the bill to pay your salary dear! On the plus side, you do get a very comfortable bed at a reasonable price.

The 20th arrondissment is not the most convenient location for the City centre (\u20ac17 taxi from Gare du Nord) and the surrounding area is run down, but improving. Then we discovered the 76 bus, which for \u20ac1.60 takes you from the door right to the Bastille or Louvre - one bus driver spoke perfect English! There is also a 26 bus from around the corner which will take you to several of the mainline stations. The hotel itself, which is a converted multi storey car park, is an experience and grows on you after a while. It is certainly different from any other hotel in which we have stayed. You must be prepared for dark rooms and funky decor including writing on the ceilings and carpets, masks on the bedside lights and plasma screens in the loos and used as dining tables. I agree with previous reports that the minimalist approach to lighting in the rooms can be difficult, if you want to read or find something. As regards the food, the breakfast is expensive, but so is everything else in Paris. We have no complaints about the service or the quality of food, which was in fact better than some continental breakfasts we have eaten. We tried the dinner on two evenings (which included a completely off the wall DJ on Saturday night). The restaurant and bars get very busy, so eat early if you don't want a crowded space. Again, the food was not sparkling, but quite sound and efficiently served, although service was a bit slow on Saturday, although hardly surprising given the number of diners. A previous report mentioned noise. We had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the main road (no noise issue). The real problem came from the rock bar opposite, where music was thumping out until 4.00 am. After two nights of this we complained - the result was a free breakfast and an immediate change of room to the back. They took our complaint seriously and dealt with it promptly - now I call that excellent service.
