I got a great rate and was looking to do nothing but unwind at the pool and have some good dinners. It was perfect for that. First off, it's the Four Seasons with all that comes with that. Hotel was immaculate and beautiful. Rooms were big, staff was friendly and helpful. Pool area is fantastic with large pool, lots of chairs and cabanas and hammocks hanging from palm trees in a fake lagoon. Note, it's in the Financial District so not a party area and there is no beach. There is a fun area that is 15 minutes walking or one stop on train that I think is called 10th Street Promenade/Brikell Village. Lots of restaurants, bars, etc. and always seemed crowded and lively. A couple of points that could be improved with hotel-- the first day we sat at the far end of the pool and it seemed that the pool staff would serve one side or the other and never come to the end. That would be fine, but they were not trained to look around to see EVERYONE at the end of the pool waiving at them to get service. Other days we sat elsewhere and service was great. Also, service just seemed a little slow everywhere at the hotel. Maybe Miami is just on a different clock since it seemed that way most places we went to. Finally, check out only had 1 person at desk and 4 people in line. It took much longer than it should have. Please note, for any other hotel chain this would have gone unnoticed but for a Four Seasons it seemed a bit lacking compared to the others I have stayed at. As for the area-- Azul at the Mandarin (as well as the bar and bartender there) were outstanding -- it's a 1 mile walk or a quick cab ride. Also, Four Seasons has amazing sunday brunch. It's the kind you read about. All you can eat everything including a chilled seafood bar-- great for special occasions -- note that it's $75 but includes alcohol. Trulucks just down the street was also excellent for dinner with a good bar and live entertainment (entertainer was terrible when we were there but hopefully changes nightly).", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huddersfield, UK", "Title": "\u201cgreat stay at four seasons\u201d", "Author": "YorkshireGirl33", "ReviewID": "UR125150542", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights in February and both the service and quality were excellent.

We chose Miami for convenience and looking for some warm weather. We are regulars in the Miami hotel scene \u00e2\u20ac\u201calthough we live in DC- and have had our fistful of mediocre and bad experiences. Our initial booking was at the Lowes Hotel in South Beach, wanting to try something new. My wife arrived first and called me from the check-in line. The staff, the guests, and the whole experience from the beginning were not meant for us. Expensive, dirty, bad attitude, all of that starting at the front desk. She had to stay for the night while we search for alternatives. I believe she said I had a coronary or something of that sort, just to be able to run away. We were very lucky to book a room the next day at Four Seasons, on Brickell Avenue. Not a small feat taking into account that this weekend the Miami Boat and Sail Show and the Coconut Grove Art Festival were taking place. The Four Seasons is a superb hotel. Starting with the art in the lobby and in the reception. When you arrive a Botero beauty welcomes you. And also some of the most attractive glass pieces I have seen lately. It was packed but you always felt the special treatment. You could see that the 100 % occupancy was taxing the staff but they kept a courteous attitude and kind service. The new EDGE steak house is a top-notch restaurant and bar with great food and hip ambiance; also room service is the best. I need to compare this experience with what happened to us at the Mandarin just a few blocks away, also supposedly one of the best chains in the world. It was a rip off from the beginning. I booked a rate at their Internet site and they refused to acknowledge it charging me their top fees. Our room stayed undone until five, room service was basically non-existent and guests had no access to the properties restaurants because they have them assigned to celebrities.

I assume they meant the Four Seasons, because it's been 12 hours and I already do. Thank God it's just across the street. We tried Edge, the Four Seasons' newly opened steakhouse last night for happy hour. The experience was perfection. All other restaurants take notes. Having never been to any Four Seasons, I was very excited to get dolled up and pretend to be fancy while secretly looking for famous people. The lobby was gorgeous as any luxury hotel's is. Sleek and luxurious with a jewelry shop selling drool worthy baubles...for any season. Immediately, we were greeted by the entire team of the New York Knicks. Famous people count: very high. Could I identify any player? Of course not, but the fanciness factor was great. So we headed upstairs to floor seven where Edge has a beautiful, intimate indoor/outdoor set-up. The interior looked very much like the Viceroy. Plush with just the perfect amount of twist. Leather in colors that couldn't possibly occur in nature but were oh so chic. That sort of thing. We opted for seats at the bar for optimal people watching. Newbies to Miami take note of this happy hour. Two for one drinks. Any drink. This makes two glasses of Nicolas Feulliate $18 total or two cocktails $13 or two beers $6. They also offer oysters and marinated beef satay for $1. This happens from 3PM to 7PM everyday. At the Four Seasons. Wow! We opted just for drinks and the adorable baskets of homemade kettle chips they kept in front of you. Seen here. Thank you for reminding us they are fried, Four Seasons. Oh well, tiny things, even fryer baskets, are always cute and calorie free. Everyone knows this. So we're enjoying our drinks and who walks in but two old guys. Not just any old guys, famous old guys. Again, did I know this? Nope. But the spouse about fell out of chair. It was John Bolton, US ambassador to the UN during the last administration. Google images confirmed this! The excitement was contagious. I strongly encouraged spouse to ask John if he needed legal representation or at least for an autograph, but his martini wasn't working. The other old man had us furiously Google searching to figure out why Bolton was in town and who he might be. We never got a great view of his face though since his back was to us all night (rude!)

Anyone who has stayed at any Four Seasons knows that they ask for that information because they like to make your children feel special. When we got there it was not done. I thought because we had an upgrade perhaps it would come later, it did not. I made a call to concierge and was told they do not do anything for children at this hotel... Very odd. I called back after about 5 minutes and had Robe, slippers and bath toys.. (my son too old for those plus we had no tub in our room) but it was amazing how suddenly these items were made available.

The only downside was that the beds were super small. We always travel with our kids so we book a double room which usually means 2 queen beds, but is sometimes 2 full beds. I can't even call these beds at the Four Seasons full size. They were somewhere between twin and full (which I can't say I have seen before).

The bed made me look forward to going to sleep at night, it was so cozy. The view from the bedroom was great. I loved that there was a doorbell, a long hallway, a living room with another sitting window with a great view. I can't say enough. The Mini-Bar-Not so mini-it had everything you could think you would want! Top shelf vodka, redbull, wine, juices, etc. Just top shelf. Candy, chips, gummy bears, nicely stocked from top to bottom. No it's not cheap but it's about what you would pay for a drink at a high end bar/restaurant. When I stayed at the Westin they offered an empty fridge...just horrible! The Epic didn't have on eat all.... The Hotel Bar-Be sure you ask the bartender if they know how to make certain drinks. They seem to be well versed in some but, not all. The bar is beautiful right next to pool. They even have a waterfall you can sit in while having your drinks. Just truly amazing! The Pool-GORGEOUS and great for lounging. The Spa Boutique-very nice unique jewelry, clothing (if you're the size 4 everyone in Miami is), great products and friendly staff. I bought a great back for a little over $100 by Budha...very nice! The Hotel Shop-great items, great jewelry, magazines, perfume, clothing, bathing suits (Trina Turk). The Sports Club LA-if you know this chain then you don't need to ask...GREAT! The Parking-very organized but, I suggest calling for your car at least 10 mins before you head down so you won't have to wait.

Take a taxi and just walk Pr rent a bike for the day. Ask them about Lincold RD. They were really helpful. The breakfast was great but EXPENSIVE. Ask then about the good spot they don't mind.

We had to overnight an additional night in Saint Maarten before finally landing in Miami, the overnight at the Four Seasons was always planned as part of our trip, we were able to change dates without problems and check in seamlessly when we arrived. I booked through American Express Platinum and we were upgraded to a corner suite that really left us speechless for a few seconds. The color scheme in soft greens and the light color of the furniture make up for a really soothing environment. That room was wonderful to walk in to. And we had stayed at an ultra luxury boutique hotel in Saint Barth's, we thought it would have been a tough act to follow. Aside from that, the lobby of the hotel is grand. The signature room scent they use is fresh without being overpowering and I could not find a speck of dust on any surface. Our check in did not take more than 3 minutes, they are really quick and very courteous. We dined at the bar, the food took a bit longer than expected but it was very well prepared and presented, the service was discrete and unobtrusive, not in-your-face. The bed was so comfortable and soft, I don't remember anything else after I laid my head down, I have troubles falling asleep but in that bed it seemed I fell asleep faster than usual. We were impressed with the quality of the food, the level of service, how clean everything was and the refined luxury of this hotel, a stark contrast with other luxury hotels in Miami that are perhaps a bit over the top. It is not located in SoBe which may be a drag for those seeking the nightlife and restaurants there, however having lived in SoBe for 3 years and being now a frequent visitor, I think I have found a new place to stay, I would not care that it's not at the beach, and if I want to plan a beach day, I would drive to it but then return to the comfort and good food of this hotel. It really beats any of the hotels I have stayed at in SoBe, worth the distance. I did some research about where to stay that night returning from Saint Barth's because I wanted to close the vacation with something special, it was a trip to celebrate my 40th birthday.

It just didn't add up to the experience one expects from Four Seasons. As always with hotels of this high rung, it isn't the basics that matter, but rather, the details, and that is where the hotel didn't excel. It was adequate, but at this level, adequate is just not enough. Yes, it's exclusive- the rates make sure of that. For a hotel located in downtown (which is a terrible location- you need a taxi to get to absolutely everything a tourist might want to get to, I would not recommend this location if you are a leisure traveler at all), but that's all. I had a Bed & Breakfast package, which meant I had $55 credited to spend on breakfast every morning- we were three people, and breakfast usually ran $91 without purchasing anything extra. The food itself was very good, an acceptable selection and brilliant taste. The staff at the restaurant too were quite willing, and did accommodate orders that were not on the menu (for example, fresh papaya juice). I stayed in an Executive Suite, and the room itself was large, with a separate bathroom for guests, plenty of storage space, a brilliant lie mat on the window ledge, a good view and a very comfortable bed. For a city hotel, the swimming pool is vast, beautiful, and clean. The pool side service was really great, sun screen and beverages provided, as well as pool toys. Looking out from the pool, you'd think your in a resort, not a downtown property. So what is my main quibble then? At Four Seasons, it just happens that other than great, solid hardware, and relatively good service in the public areas, you except staff to go further- not to fly, but you need not order slippers, ask for a third bed to be made at midnight when you already informed the front office earlier, have the coffee making machine taken away even though you have made it clear to housekeeping that you want it to stay in the suite, then it takes two hours for them to bring it back to the suite. Throughout, the service was reactive, not proactive. The staff didn't anticipate your needs, you told them, then you told them again. You even have to hang a notice on your door to receive a newspaper. Perhaps this may seem like a rather small quibble to warrant such a low rating. Yet at this rate (both figuratively and financially) if its not the excellent, then its not good enough- there is somewhere else your $500+ a night can go. Overall, the hotel wasn't bad- a less-than-excellent Four Seasons is still probably better than most hotels, but in my experience, the Ritz-Carlton South Beach (or any of the near by Ritz-Carltons) would probably be a better choice. Also, upon check-in should the front desk ask you to ''move to a more comfortable'' room, do ask to see both rooms, or just stick to the one you took instead of grab the upsell- and to be honest, such standard upsells to all guests (I heard it be done three times) as is on the Four Seasons website isn't something you'd expect from the world's foremost hotel chain.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great service, super comfy beds!\u201d", "Author": "trvlchnl", "ReviewID": "UR116569837", "Content": "We stayed for 1 night in July for a party there.

Having ended our cruise in Fort Lauderdale, we picked up our rental car and drove to Miami; upon arrival at the valet I was a little disappointed to be asked \"Who are you here to see sir?\" OK, Alamo did do us a disservice and provided us with a Kia 4x4, but still it's a little rude to assume you're not staying at the hotel just because you're driving a KIA! We then arrived at reception, as we were a little early, even though we'd asked for an early check-in, we were informed that our room would be an hour or so until it was ready. We were informed that we could go and grab a drink at the pool bar whilst we waited, but in fairness the atmosphere was not very friendly at all. I asked if there was another room which we could have, only to be told that the hotel was at capacity, and the only other room available was a suite, which we'd have to pay an additional $200 to upgrade to. As we were on honeymoon we thought we'd upgrade despite the additional cost. Once we'd finished checking in and paid for our upgrade we were told the room wouldn't be ready of an hour or so either, I was a little surprised as the whole reason for the upgrade was to avoid waiting. We proceeded to the pool bar, to get a drink whilst our suite was being cleaned, the pool area is nice, but doesn't compare to the Four Season Hampshire or Sharm El Sheikh. Our waitress was quite off with us, and made us feel as if we were bothering her, which is not the kind of service you expect from this hotel group. After well over any hour we were shown to our room, this was very nice indeed, but didn't feel as well appointed as other rooms in the hotel group. After a dip in the pool we decided to head into Miami for some dinner, and asked one of the concierge team to recommend somewhere for dinner, the recommendation was an excellent and dinner was lovely. The next morning we ordered some breakfast from the room service menu, only to find the $55 allowance (which is part of the bed and breakfast package) was bordering on the ridiculous, and if you wanted a decent breakfast you'd need to spend at least another $20 on top, petty I know, but when you're spending $900 a night on a room, you'd expect breakfast would be included, and not limited to a certain figure (which is not a realistic one at that). Having requested a late check-out we were annoyed to be called at 12pm on the dot, and asked if we needed any help with our luggage, in other words \"can you please leave now\" I explained we'd requested a late check-out, only to be told that wasn't possible, but if we wanted to pay for another night we could leave as late as we wanted. So it wasn't a case of we don't have the room, it was a case of we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not prepared to give you a free late check-out! Unfortunately we found the hotel to be a disappointment, yes it is a lovely hotel, and in a great location, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. I strongly suggest that the Four Seasons Miami send their staff to be trained under Charlie Parker at the Four Seasons Hampshire, or Oliver Bruns at the Four Seasons Sharm El Sheikh. One further disappointment before I end my review, about a week after our return to the UK, we received a questionnaire via email, asking us to give feedback on our recent stay, I filled the questionnaire in, and provided plenty of detail around the issues we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d experienced with a hotel of this calibre, and was asked to provide a telephone number so the hotel manager could contact me personally, well, 8 months on I am still waiting for that telephone call\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chennai, India", "Title": "\u201cA decent experience\u201d", "Author": "Alok42", "ReviewID": "UR111237716", "Content": "We stayed here on a Holiday with family.

Before going, I did a lot of research and chose Four Seasons because of my previous good experiences with the brand, and a reasonable price at this time of the year. Good things: pool was excellent, much larger than Mandarin Oriental or hotels in Miami Beach. Service at the pool is great as well, and not as many people as in Setai, Mandarin Oriental, or other comparable hotels (we went there for meals and checked them out). The restaurant Aqua was the best service and food quality / price ratio for Miami. Try their daily specials. Service with parking and at the arrival is very good too. So make sure you come to Aqua even if you do not stay at this hotel. Bad things: the rooms and the service at the front desk were ok, just OK. That is, it was not Four Seasons, it was just one more OK five star hotel. They do not seem to understand their competition. Another problem is that there is only one restaurant at the hotel (Aqua). It is good, but it is not a five star hotel standard, especially in Miami. If you go to a gym, be aware that though the gym is large and has various equipment, it is dated and there is no exclusivity - it is not a Four Seasons gym, just as their spa is also in the office building and not part of the hotel. You are a kind of 'trapped' in the hotel because you have to change lifts to get out, to the ground level. Though they try to present it as a question of 'exclusivity,' it also means that there is no exclusivity, since you are sharing environment with office workers and everyone else all the time by changing lifts and not having a proper hotel entrance / lobby. There is not 'grand' lobby upon entering, like in most other Four Seasons - so do not expect the same level of 'wow' factor. In short, though we enjoyed some aspects of this hotel (pool area, the restaurant), on our next trip to Miami we will stay elsewhere, most probably in Mandarin Oriental, Setai, the Tides or Delano, where there is this 'wow' factor that this one does not have.", "Date": "May 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Murfreesboro, TN", "Title": "\u201cNot a place to Relax\u201d", "Author": "lyyoung", "ReviewID": "UR109543511", "Content": "This hotel is located on the top floor of a high rise office building in downtown miami.

They are extremely rude, text and talk on their phones while driving. The taxi drivers in Miami are the worst drivers I have encountered anywhere in the world. ANYWHERE. The valet service at this hotel should be able to supply the drivers with the necessary information for their hotel guests. They are unwilling to do this. They need to be trained by the valet services at the Four Seasons in Seattle. The taxi drivers in Seattle are terrible as well but at least the staff at the Four Seasons Seattle are 'tip-top' and able and willing to help their guests with addresses. It appears that the majority of staff at the Four Seasons Miami have not been trained well, if at all. Most of them are surly, young, inexperienced young adults with terrible argumentative attitudes. The only reason that I continued my stay at this hotel and didn't go to the Mandarin Oriental was because of the wonderful concierge Carlos. Without Carlos, this hotel would be run into the ground. Another wonderful concierge is Vicky, although I had less interaction with her. Finally, there is an additional 18% service charge for room service plus another few dollars...this is unacceptable.

Everything was prepared for us, and she noted that we had been upgraded for the duration of our stay. We found it noteworthy that she walked around to the front of the desk to present the room keys. She then escorted us to the elevators. A nice touch. Abbey had a colleague -- a trainee -- at the desk. Her name was Emmanuella. This delightful young woman worked closely and in harmony with Abbey. She later handled our departure, and she managed that process with poise and precision. Both Abbey and Emmanuella addressed us by name whenever they saw us during our visit -- a nice, personal touch that is rarely seen in domestic hotels. The housekeeping staff was very attentive to detail. The room always was spotless whenever the housekeeper entered, either to make the room or to turn the bed at night. While it is not significant overall, we found that few, if any, of the housekeepers understood English; hene, it was difficult for me to communicate messages with most of them. This was not a burden for me. I now turn to Mr Delgado, a food and beverage manager. We saw him most mornings when we had breakfast. He was a special treat. He always took time to greet us, and to talk about something interesting. Because we ususlly ate outside, we took note that Mr Delgado spent lots of time chasing napkins that were blowing around in the wind. This was impressive; hedidnot delegate this minor task to others -- he did it himself. He paid close attention to detail in discharging his duties. He is a superior leader.

The hotel occupanies maybe 20 floors of a building so you end up taking 2 different elevators to get to your room. It is in kind of a business district and did have a business like feel to it. It did surprise us that this is no where near a beach though we had a nice view of the bay. So we ended up driving to Bill Baggs State Park about 15 minutes away. We went to the beach near the lighthouse and swam in the ocean for hours (very warm and very clear). There is a service on the beach where for $20 you get a beach umbrella and two recliners. This beach is more protected and so avoided the \"high bacterial counts/unsafe to swim\" warnings that occurred at beaches only 1 mile away. In the past we stayed at the Ritz Key Biscayne, which has its own private access to a beach, but there was so much seawood that you couldn't swim or enjoy the sand there.

I have stayed at 5 star hotels around the world and this hotel should be categorised as a 3 star. Dont bother with room service, even though the service is friendly and efficient the food is horrible. We ordered a few times and were very disappointed. We had dinner at the restaurant in the hotel, there were only 2 other tables booked that night, the food was average and the staff friendly, however the staff at the adjacent bar should be fired for being so rude, we were ignored even though we walked up and sat at the bar counter.

The rooftop pool was one of the nicest I've ever seen. Everything from the pool to the landscaping was just stunning. It really looked like an oasis. The only problem we had during our stay was the service at the pool. We were there between Christmas and New Years and it was crowded. I think we found the last few empty chairs. Every afternoon we went, the poolside service was far below Four Season standards. It took us awhile to flag an attendant down to get towels. Not a single attendant approached us to see if we needed anything. We didn't bother ordering food or drinks- I don't think we could have gotten an attendant to take our order. They were racing around us and it looked like they didn't want to make eye contact in case someone were to flag them down.

Check in / out was particularly impressive as it was made such a personal experience - never before have I had someone walk out from behind the reception desk to hand me my key. The hotel is decorated throughout in a very understated way from the enormous statues in both the ground floor lobby and 7th-floor reception to the corridors on each floor furnished with side tables, lamps and pictures, so unlike the dull or bland public areas you find in many hotels. The room on the relatively-low 25th floor (the building has 70 floors) was large and bright with a great cushioned window seat looking out over the urban landscape. The kingsize bed was wonderful - firm but comfortable with the softest Italian sheets. The bathroom was very large and well-equipped - with a separate marble/glass shower cubicle and wc in another room - complete with L'Occitane toiletries. We spent a couple of hours down by the pool which was heated to a very pleasant temperature and again the service was very good with plenty of towels and chilled water supplied by the courteous attendants.

The Four Seasons was running a promotion that had a reasonable rate for two nights and added a complimentary third night. I have stayed at several other nice hotels, including two other Four Seasons, several Ritz properties, a couple of St. Regis properties, and a Peninsula property. This property has become my third favorite hotel in the U.S., and definitely my favorite in Miami. (FYI -- Four Seasons St. Louis ranks first, and the St. Regis San Fran ranks second). The highlights -- service is excellent, rooms are spacious with incredible views of the water (I stayed in a \"moderate\" room), the food is delicious, and the amenities are top notch. Lowlights -- the Four Seasons professes not to \"nickel and dime\" its customers but unfortunately I saw some of that at this location -- e.g., you have to pay for wireless (approximately $12 to $15 per night), significant food delivery charges, overpriced minibar (St. Louis charges much less for same items), outrageous parking fees ($34 per night), and pencils instead of pens in the room. I understand that this is a top notch hotel and so you get what you pay for, but some of this (particularly the exorbitant parking fee) is simply unnecessary. With that said, the positive experiences far outweighed the negative ones at this property and I can say without hesitation that this is my favorite hotel in Miami. Here is a more detailed description of my stay: ROOM -- spacious for the price (again, I booked a \"moderate\" room), but not as big as the St. Louis FS property rooms. They just installed beautiful big screen LCD televisions in the rooms, but they don't have any high definition channels yet so the TVs kind of go to waste. Fortunately I brought my PS3 and was able to watch BluRay movies in 1080p quality. I'm told that high def channels will be added in early October. While they're at it they should add an electronic TV guide. The windows in the room are nice and big (though not floor to ceiling) and there's a ledge you can sit on to read, use your laptop, or chill while looking out the window, which is a really nice touch. The problem is that there are three layers of drapes you have to wade through to get to the window and the first layer covers up a significant portion of the window so the room doesn't maximize this feature. The bathroom is very spacious with a stand up shower, really nice tub that has arm rests, large mirror (no TV in them though like the St. Louis property), separate toilet room, and heated marble floor panels. There's a large working desk (which I used a great deal) and you can view the TV while using the desk or position the chair to just as easily look through the window. There is wired and wireless internet available at a charge of approximately $12 to $15 per day (this was a no-no, it needs to be incorporated into the room rate or something). There's also a very comfortable lounge chair with foot stool. The AC in my room blew out very cold air all the time, but this was promptly fixed when I brought it to management's attention. The bed is your typically incredible Four Seasons bed with linens that are made of an angel's wings, pillows that are filled with feathers of the finest geese in the world, and a mattress stuffed with clouds. One day I'm gonna buy one for my house. SERVICE -- the service is great. Employees go out of their way to be friendly and anticipate your needs. For example, the bar by the pool makes a great raspberry lemonade drink. This wasn't on the room service menu but room service went out of their way to make a whole pitcher for me so I had it in my room throughout my stay. Special appreciation goes out to Mario (the front office manager) who went out of his way before I arrived to make sure I would enjoy my stay and followed up with me afterwards. Also Mario in room service (not the same guy) was very courteous, friendly, conversational, and was always smiling. These two employees epitomize what the FS stands for --treat others like you would like to be treated. FOOD -- one word: delicious! Try the baked sea bass and the chive mashed potatoes. I had this meal every single evening while I was there it was so good. For lunch, the wagyu burger and bolognese were excellent. Only down side is that it's expensive. A two course meal without alcohol costs approximately $90 when you include tip and the service/delivery charges. I did not try Acqua (the on site restaurant) during this stay but I have in the past and can assure you it is not as good as the in room dining. POOL -- the pool is really nice and the attendants there make sure your every whim is catered to with a smile. Nancy and Zola were terrific. Always there to refill my drinks or give me free samples of fruit and smoothies. If you don't fancy the raspberry lemonade (which is not on the menu) then ask for the Banana Bahia (like a banana shake with cinnamon and vanilla). SPA -- The spa is way overpriced but the treatments are pretty good. The spa at the St. Louis property is far better at half the price. GYM -- the gym is a Sports Club LA. I am a member since I live in Miami, so I was familiar with it. It is well equipped and the personal trainers are popular (if you're thinking of purchasing a session ask for Alan, who has been there the longest and is the most popular). Some of the treadmills are old, but they all have their own personal television screens (even if the reception is unpredictable). Busy time is between 7 and 8:30 a.m., and between 6 and 8 p.m. You do NOT want to visit the gym during those hours of the week. PARKING -- this is where this property receives its lowest marks. The attendants and bellhops are wonderful, but the pricing is outrageous. $34 per night is simply too high even for Miami's standards, and especially for Brickell's standards. I paid $100 to park my car for three nights. This was a joke. They need to change this -- lower the rate to $15 or $20 per night max or at least give guests a decent option to self-park (the current option is $30 per night so you may as well use valet). MISCELLANEOUS -- if you're a tennis fan/player, this is the hotel for you. They have a great relationship with the Brickell Tennis Club, which is the premier tennis facility in downtown Miami. The pros there are excellent and the clinics are a lot of fun. In sum, I had a really great stay at this property. I'm going to return for a \"staycation\" at some point in the near future, without a doubt. It was a great way to unwind while being pampered for the weekend.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london U.K", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay\u201d", "Author": "SharonlondonU.K", "ReviewID": "UR35497907", "Content": "When we first arrived we were given a suite with a king size bed which is NOT what we booked 6 months before!

I took advantage of low airfares and flew from Los Angeles non-stop for only $280 on American.

FS are never in a bad part of town, and the hotel didn't disappoint. Very nicely done, usual great amenities, and I'll give it five out of five for everything, especially the very friendly staff. The concierges gave good directions for tourist stuff, and the hotel itself is located overlooking Biscayne Bay. On arrival, I was upgraded without asking to a bayside room, with a great view from the 27th floor. The only thing is, as one reviewer commented, it is downtown, and is probably more useful for business travelers. After dark, the downtown area, like that in Los Angeles, shuts down. And it is amidst other skyscrapers, so the setting is no different than any other metropolitan city. No real beaches are nearby, the waterfront is all commercial/residential with no sand. That being said, I'm not complaining, because I did not do sufficient research, so that setting and location are all on me. The hotel is excellent, but if you're a tourist, stay on Miami Beach, plenty of great hotels, restaurants, clubs, and beautiful beaches. Next time, that's where I'll be! The only odd thing, in all the other Four Seasons I've visited (Scottsdale, Las Vegas, North San Diego, San Francisco), there were coffeemakers in the room. None here.

The pool area is lovely, the pool staff did a wonderful job of attending to all of our needs, and the water temperature was perfect. A prior reviewer had commented about a window seat running the length of the window in her room that overlooked the bay. We had a similar seat and view, and she was right about it being a fantastic place to pass the time. The Bad: $34 per night for parking. The hotel is also located in the financial district, where there is not much to see (but then again, the hotel is nice enough that you could easily never want to venture outside the property). The Unexpected: High-speed internet access was free for people whose high-speed internet service provider at home is AT&T. (Apparently AT&T owns the company that provides the service.) We like staying at Four Seasons hotels because they offer child-friendly properties, comfortable rooms and fantastic service. They excel at making guests feel as if they are in an oasis of understated luxury. The Four Seasons Miami is no exception. At $295 per night, the Four Seasons Miami also offered good value. Miami hotels are expensive. A mediocre hotel in the South Beach area would cost at least $250 per night, and a hotel of the same caliber as the Four Seasons but in the South Beach area would run well over $500 per night.

I will start by saying that we selected this location because we were offered a very lucrative rate due to some connections. That said, we had a very spacious one-bedroom suite that had one and a half bathrooms. While very spacious, I was not necessarily impressed with the \"luxury\" offered in the room. We did have two televisions, but neither of them were plasma. For a Four Seasons, I would have assumed that a plasma TV would be de rigeur. Other than that, I found the rooms to be spotless, comforatble, tasteful, and spacious, but not necessarily \"luxurious\". Second, the building has a layout that is common in many large cities like NYC (where I am from), in that the lobby is on the seventh floor. Not an issue, necessarily, unless you need to/want to access a car. You need to take two, or in some cases three, different elevators to access your vehicle. If you do it frequently, it can be a bit tedious. So, if you don't expect to go far, or leave much, it's a non-issue. Third, I thought that the pool area was suberb, and the Sports Club LA and adjoining spa services, were convenient, and top notch. The service at the pool was impeccable, as well - unobtrusive yet attentive - not at all obsequious as is often the case at a Ritz Carlton, where everything is their pleasure. I would caution people, however on a couple of minor but noteworthy things. First, this location is in downtown Miami where there is still, for some reason, a building boom. You can actually hear the construction from the pool during the work week. Second, as has already been noted by other reviewers, the location is not convenient to any beach. One could be quite content staying at the pool area, like we were. However, I think after a three or four night stay, that might become trite. That is why I categorize this as a great getaway. I liken this establishment to being in a luxurious cocoon that just happens to be in Miami. Lots of NY'ers would probably feel comfortable in this hotel because everything is within the building, the service is impeccable, and it caters to inidividuals with sophisticated palettes. If you are adventuresome, however, and like to be in the thick of things, and like to walk outside and feel engergized, this would not make you happy.

If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re choosing between the Four Seasons and the Mandarin, the pool at the Four Seasons is far superior. Much bigger, and with much more space around it. Similarly, having access to the Sports Club/LA at the Four Seasons is a big plus, as there are lots of classes offered. We ate breakfast in Acqua twice and found it excellent both times.

From the moment we walked into the hotel, everyone treated us like royalty. I don't think they ever say no to anything that you ask for! Since it was our honeymoon and I informed them ahead of time, they placed a plate full of chocolate covered strawberries in our room when we arrived and a nice note. It was really a nice touch. We booked our room online for $275/night through the hotel's website with the 5th night free. I thought it was a good deal for how nice of a property you get. Even though we paid for the rack rate room (a city view) we were given a room with a partial bay view bc it was our honeymoon and I asked. When we got to the room, I saw that it was next to a large crane, so I asked to be moved. They were gracious in accommodating us and gave us an upgrade to a full bay view. It was gorgeous and we loved waking up each morning to a beautiful view. The rooms were not huge and could use a little updating (I was surprised that a 5 star hotel doesn't have flat screen TVs-- but then again, who goes to Miami to sit in their room and watch TV??). The bathroom was amazing-- all marble, a separate tub and shower and beautiful granite vanity. Overall, I would agree with earlier posts that this is a great hotel if you want to hang out by the pool. It might have one of the best hotel pools in Miami. The pool service was great. We never had trouble getting a cabana because the poolside area was not crowded. This makes a big difference if you are looking for a tranquil, quiet setting while you sunbathe (other hotel pools are crowded and you have to fight for a lounge chair). Beware that the pool side drinks and food do come at a price! $13 for a drink. We just went to the grocery store and bought some things to take down to the pool. We also liked that the pool was open 24 hrs a day, so you can take a late night dip if you like. Another nice feature is the use of the gym, which has classes and exercise equipment. The only cons I can think of are: --Food is expensive --Valet parking is also expensive (33/nt) --You need a car to get around town. Note that you are *not* in South Beach, but in the downtown financial district. I didn't mind the drive, I actually preferred being away from all the craziness of SoBe and just going there for dinner.

Overall we were pleased with the stay but felt the hotel did not live up to our expectation of service from a Four Seasons Hotel. Noone ever addressed us by name. I thought that was a signature for Four Seasons Hotels. The service is definitely on the cold side except for the hardworking pool attendants. They worked very hard and were always asking us if everything was okay and if we needed anything. They were just great. Housekeeping left a lot to be desired, especially considering the usual standards of Four Seasons Hotels. We asked on numerous occassions that the dirty glasses in our room be replaced but time and after time they forgot and we had to call and ask again. One day they cleaned the room and forgot to replace the toilet paper. On some days they forgot to leave bath gel. The room was spotless but they were quite forgetful. We had asked that the mini bar be emptied and they emptied it but they also locked it so we could not store anything. We had to call the front desk to have it unlocked. One morning we were awakened in error by a wake up call that was meant for another room. They apologized for the error. The hotel lobby and pool grounds are beautiful. The rooms are medium size, well appointed, and views are okay, nothing too great. There is construction going on next to the hotel and there are two big construction cranes. We could see one of the cranes from our room. The food and drinks at the pool were pretty good but nothing fabulous. Free use of the pool cabanas is a nice touch. I did not see anyone using the pool with the palm trees in it. They never offered to set our chairs up in that pool as it pictured on the web site photos. The pool with the palm trees is much smaller that you would think from looking at the web site photos. The hotel is a great respite from the constant action on South Beach. Every time I entered the hotel I felt like I was in my own sanctuary. Very quiet, great smells fill the air, it really is a relaxing environment. Free bottles of water at the valet desk and use of hotel umbrellas is also a nice touch. We went to the health club on a few days, it is very large and seems to have all the equipment one could need. The views of the city are nice, expect for the building across the stree that is under construction. We spent a lot on cabs, but felt the cab service we received was very good. We secured a great room rate throught Travelocity, we paid $200/night for all seven nights.

This made for a very quiet stay, despite the fact the hotel was hosting participants in a Latin music awards program. For eating and other activities outside the hotel, however, there are limited choices. Cab rides to Coral Gables, Cocconut Grove and South Beach are likely if you stay as long as we did. You can use the metromover and metrorail systems to get around as well. The hotel lobby and rooms are very nice, exceptionally clean, and consistent with the Four Seasons we have stayed in elsewhere. The valet, bellservice, and housekeeping personnel are very nice although some language barriers do exist. We found the concierge service to be friendly but inconsistently helpful. Some of the best recommendations came from the bellmen and room service staff. The room service food was good and we were given prompt, polite attention.

The outdoor bar area by the pool is very nice and is a must either during the day or evening - they serve lunch during the day and bar food in the evenings. On the negative side, the main hotel restaurant, Acqua, was disappointing. Food quality was sub-par and the fusion style food on the menu didn't work. Other slight negatives were that one day part of the pool area was closed for a private reception - they didn't tell us this when we booked or checked in.

The downtown area is a bit of a ghost town at night. A few towers sit dark & empty. Others remain under construction. However there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s some life sprouting-up in the area. New restaurants & bars, along with a great basketball arena & a beautiful opera house are bringing some much-needed energy to a long-neglected part of town. The Four Seasons is certainly doing its part to build on that momentum. Located in the tallest building in Miami, the hotel is sleek & modern. The lobby is visually stunning with its high ceilings & stylish decor. It even smelled nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like an English garden after a spring rain. Sports Club LA is located here too & guests have access to the gym which is a huge plus. Our room was very comfortable with impressive skyline views. The swimming pool is located on the 7th floor. The setting is perfect. A large outdoor pool along w/a Jacuzzi & a wading pool w/palm trees. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an oasis among the high rises! However we concluded that the service at the Four Seasons didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t quite match-up to its beautiful setting. We base this assessment also on previous stays at other FS hotels. We hope FS Miami will take the following points as constructive criticism! Overall, our stay at the Four Seasons was very good but not excellent. For one thing, the pool could use a facelift. Parts of the pool has paint chipping & I detected several noticeable cracks along the perimeter of the pool. The patch-up job done on some of the cracks looked very sloppy. The maid service was unsatisfactory. For example, the maids were chintzy with the shampoo & conditioner. We had to call & ask for extra bottles a couple of times. Then things started to mysteriously disappear from our room. First it was the waste paper basket in our bathroom. Then it was the Do Not Disturb sign (which was last seen INSIDE our room). We laughed it off at first. I mean, we never experienced hotel staff allegedly stealing hotel items! But it became irritating because none of the items mentioned were returned or replaced. Finally, in other Four Seasons establishments, we always found little treats on our pillow; a strategically-placed bookmark on the book sitting on the bedside table or toiletries arranged symmetrically by the sink. These Four Seasons touches were conspicuously missing. My wife & I started to think that maybe we were placed in a section of the hotel which was relegated for less-desirable travelers. We started calling our floor the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Orbitz Floor.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd In conclusion, we believe a few minor improvements would bring the Miami branch up-to-par with the excellence that the Four Seasons is known for.

We considered the Setai as an alternative, but found the Four Seasons had larger rooms and a little less attitude. The restaurant, Acqua, was lovely. Had dinner and breakfast there, and both were flawless. To give you a sense of just how good they are--my traveling companion wore a black dress to breakfast one morning and they made sure to give her a black napkin--god forbid a white napkin leave lint on her! It's just those little touches that make the Four Seasons stand out. We were upgraded to a room on a high floor with a view of the bay. Stunning. Our room even had a little window seat area, where I read my morning paper each day and ate some of the fresh fruit they had left for us. The bathrooms are enormous and have all the amenities you expect--the plush and plentiful towels, the soft and cuddly bathrobes, the L'Occitane products, and always a full stock of cotton balls and Qtips. There were more than enough hangers of every variety in the closet, and plenty of drawer space for your clothing. The valet service was flawless (prompt, friendly and always willing to give accurate directions) and they always offered us a much-needed bottle of ice-cold water as we departed and returned to the hotel. The concierge was terrific. We wanted to purchase gifts for friends who live in Miami and they sent us to all the right boutiques--exactly what we were looking for. Finally, and I know this will sound weird, but the hotel had a great smell. Yes, I said smell. I don't know if they're pumping extra oxygen in the hotel, or if they have some sort of fragrance system in place, but it always smelled fresh and clean and airy.

Our one-bedroom suite was spacious and comfortable, the FREE rollaway bed (the Ritz-Carlton Key Biscayne charges $50.00 per night for a rollaway!) and pullout couch were always promptly made up or put away when we called Housekeeping, and all the food was great, whether room service, poolside lunches, or Acqua Restaurant. The two-acre pool deck off the lobby is amazing and gorgeous, though windy -- you're seven stories up, so maybe that's why. We spent nearly the entire weekend on-site, since the pool deck is so pleasant. Be aware that this hotel is on a street with no shopping and only two restaurants close by -- everything else seems to be office buildings, so to have something to do, you have to take a cab somewhere. Two complaints: First - the hotel write-up brags about having three pools. In fact, only two are available to hotel guests: the other large pool is exclusively for the use of condo owners in the building. Why not advertise as many pools as you can see from the property, since that's as much use as you'll get out of the ones beyond the two actually open to guests? Second, the spa/salon menu on the website advertises a private room for mother-daughter (or other twosome) services such as pedicures. Wanting to give my daughters a treat, I scheduled simultaneous pedicures for the three of us, and had to call the salon at least four or five times while they worked to find a time that all three of us could be in the private room. When we arrived (early in the morning because that's the only time they said we could be accomodated), one of the three pedicure chairs was already occupied by an older gentleman, whose pedicure lasted the entire time my daughters were getting theirs. I skipped getting my pedicure to avoid having my daughters sit around and wait for me, and told the receptionist I was dissatisfied with not getting the advertised and booked mother-daughters pedicure. She passed the message along to the manager, who was not present, but it was clear they didn't really care, and I was never contacted by anyone (nor was anything done to mollify me). The pedicures cost $65.00 apiece and were not nearly as thorough as the ones we get at home for about one-third the price -- definitely not worth the money, but the whole idea was to have a special experience with my daughters, which I didn't.

At first we were worried that we should have stayed closer to the beach, but after one afternoon on the strip at South Beach, the Four Seasons was welcome oasis. South Beach was a bit too much of a freak show for the children (even though we are New Yorkers). The pool deck overlooking the bay and nearby condos is perfect for a day or 2 of relaxing and the staff and drinks are welcoming (the Brazillian drinks especially tasty). The children were able to amuse themselves the entire time, swimming and exploring the 2 acre deck. We adults enjoyed excellent massages in the spa and the children had pedicures and haircuts. All very swanky. The haircuts were less expensive than my local salon in NYC. My only gripes are that the Acqua restaurant is a bit sterile, and we would have like to hang out at the poolside Bahia bar in the evening after the kids were in bed. Unfortunately, a corporate event had closed the bar to guests. (A bit annoying given what we were paying for those 2 nights!)

Note also that the rooms are deluxe, the views lovely, but in most rooms, no balcony or fresh air. It is a glass and steel tower after all.

In other words--this is not luxury adventure travel a la the Caves in Jamaica, but it is convenient and just fine for a short get-away. Big Props to Steve Goth in the security department who mailed me back my daughter's winter coat left in the room.

Next time I will try a different hotel in Miami , probably the Mandarin Oriental.", "Date": "September 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cone of the finest experiences\u201d", "Author": "rahulrch", "ReviewID": "UR5609648", "Content": "A true gem! We stayed here for a weekend in August and loved every moment of it. You should use the valet service as it is quick and efficient (will cost you $30 a night, though). The concierge (Rod) was extremely helpful and planned the entire weekend for us. The pool is the best we have experienced till date (clean, perfect temperature). The pool staff is courteous and pleasant. The hotel has a fantastic 40,000 sq feet Sports club/LA gym and all exercise classes are complimentary for guests. The rooms are up to any FS standards with complimentary evening turn-down housekeeping. I would definetely return to this property for the service and facilities. We did not eat at the restaurants but the sunday brunch looked sumptuous. However, be warned that this hotel is in downtown Miami and not in Miami Beach and there is absolutely nothing but buildings and construction around. We did not mind as we spent all our time at Miami Beach (15 minute drive away).", "Date": "August 14, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Four Seasons Hotel Miami", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g34438-d278074-Reviews-Four_Seasons_Hotel_Miami-Miami_Florida.html", "Price": "$369 - $1,078*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1435 Brickell Ave</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Miami</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">FL</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">33131</span></span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "278074", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/13/ea/13ea9b08d2af08b855e4e5aa02c50e9e36large.jpg"}}
