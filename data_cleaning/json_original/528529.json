At first Joli seemed dark and scary (we arrived late in the evening) but in broad daylight it seemed ok. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean but there is no division between smoking and non-smoking rooms. Our room was definitely smoking and the smell was obvious. But since we kept the window open at all times, it didn't bother us too much. The bathroom is one big shower cabin which sucks. After taking a shower you can enter the bathroom only barefoot.

The very nice people working here provide a perfect service. I have been here now for 3 times - and I will go there again next year for sure. I can highly recommend the hotel to other Rome-tourists. I am from Denmark and we have no problems communicating - in english. The hotel is situated in a very busy shoppingstreet going from Piazza del Poppolo to the Vatican. A beautful area. And there is a funny thing about the elevator in the building - the hotel is on the 6th floor. If you don\u00b4t close the doors properly - the elevator doesn\u00b4t work and it can really make you breathless to climb all the way up there. But I\u00b4m so much looking forward to come back there again.

The breakfast is o.k its a donut or croissant and tea which you can take away or eat at the cafe- the first day we went there was no electric so we had a very small juice (so small you would give to a child!) The hotel is on the top floor of a building and you have to go up in a small very old elevator (scary to say the least!!) The lobby is very dark and cold, the staff speak little English. The rooms are quite large but very dated and freezing cold!!I had a room on the front of the hotel and it was very noisy, I intially picked it because I wanted a view of St.Peter's Basilica but you had to lean right out to get a look-so it's best to have room in the back for the peace!

Hotel is situated on a popular and pretty street, about ten minutes walk from the Vatican & St Peter's Square (two of the major Rome 'must do's' in the tourist manual!). We appreciated the less frenetic feel of this part of town even though the aforementioned places are such a draw for visitors. Arrived a little early to check-in so went for a wander and returned at the appointed time. Hotel is located on the sixth floor of a rather grand looking block of apartments. Came back and were greeted by a friendly receptionist who gave us the key (Room 45) as well as tokens for a breakfast (nice local cafe just around the corner, two minute walk) and a map of the city with the hotel marked on it. We found our room to be perfectly acceptable for the Joli's star rating. Everything was clean and functional. Bed was comfy, two singles joined together but not the type that induces a nightime slip between the gap between the two beds! Shower and toilet/bidet was in essence a wet room and although not at all luxurious, you don't get luxury at these prices in Rome, was fine. TV and ceiling fan too lest we forget. In essence a really good choice if you are willing to accept the 'limitations' of a budget hotel and instead focus on the location and charm of the area it is located in.

You have Piazza San Pietro and the Vatican Museums about 10 minutes away, same for Castel S'angelo, Piazza Navona and The Panteon about 20 minutes walk. For the rest of the sites, you can take the metro ( station Ottaviano) and it will take you to all the rest ( Piazza del Popolo, Fontana di Trevi, Piazza di Sapgna, Colosseum, etc). A pass for three days costs 11 EUR, and the transport is fast. Also, about the hotel, it must be said that the rooms have a very small bathroom with no ventilation, except a small fan. A 5 minute shower with warm water steams up the room guaranteed. Apart from that, be advised that the breakfast if formed from a coffe or tea and a croissant, which is the general breakfast for all italian people.

We chose the hotel for its location and value for money, we were not disappointed. It is a stones throw from the Vatican and St Peter's Square. The hotel its self is on the 6th floor of an apartment building, a bit hard to spot at first. Once we arrived we was greeted by the friendly staff, who showed us our room and told us about the gate downstairs (as one reviewer spoke of earlier) they explained that the gate is locked after 1am, but if you are out later than that let them know and they will give you a key (after all its a small family hotel and they do need to sleep). Also some people in earlier reviews complained about the breakfast. This again was explained in full to us. You get a ticket which you take to a cafe around the corner where they exchange it for a continental breakfast (Croissant and coffee) It is a 2 to 3 minute walk and about 2 streets away, not 10 minutes (the other reviewer must have gone the opposite way) It is a lovely little cafe, proper Italian feel to it.. We found the Joli Hotel extremely lovely for its price range. The room was adequate and comfy, with the basics of a bed, wardrobe, tv and bathroom. What else do you need, we was there to sightsee not sit in a hotel room al day. If you want luxury go somewhere else and pay a lot more.
