{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved hotel Panorama at Firenzie We stayed at the Hotel Panorama in Florence for one night in Sept 2008. It was a pleasent experience. The Room was nice and big, very clean with a small attached bathroom. It didnt have air conditioning (You might want that even in Sept) but that was because we had booked an economy room (not the hotels fault). The view from the room was nice, facing the Duomo. The breakfast place was great with a nice view of the city of florence. Nice farm fresh breakfast with the view was an added treat. The lift to the hotel is a little small but still manageable. The hotel is a little away from the train station but any bus going to the San Marco square and a short 3 min walk will take you to the hotel. The front desk staff was excellent. Chrisitina also went out of the way and helped us plan our short excurscion in the city (we had only 1 day in florence) and also loaned us the guide book for the city. It was a pleasure staying at this place and would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Florence. It is very well located (very near to the Duomo), well connected to the SMN train station and quite a few food joints available around (even for a late night snack). The neighborhood felt safe and the staff very very friendly. All in all a great experience.", "Date": "Sep 23, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR775376688", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ChicagoTravelerV"}, {"Content": "good people good location good price I have stayed with my family in this hotel 3 times.

This is the cheapest hotel among the 4 that I've stayed in during this trip.I was a little dissapointed with the hotel, based on what I've read from the reviews on Tripadvisor, which I always think is a good indication of the quality.The price was definitely good, euro75 for a double room, with breakfast provided. The personnel is also very nice, especially when I need to get some medications middle of the night, he rightly directed me to the nearest pharmacy that is still open at that hour.The complaint is mainly on the quality of the room. It is not air-conditioned, and that was fine, as it was not more than 30degree celcius when we were there. But the mosquitoes and noise is really bothering us. I guess I should have asked for the mosquitoes mats, anyway, make sure you do, when they are bugging you. As for noise, our room was sort of near to the alley where a travel bus stand is, hence, when the bus engine is running, it's really noisy, but after 1am was fine. I guess everyone would be in bed by then.It's good value for money, but if the hotel management put more effort in refurbishing the place, there has got a lot of potential. For instance, the dirts/stains on the walls in the room can be easily cleaned, but it wasn't, giving guest an impression that the room is not clean.", "Date": "Jun 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR608977707", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "YunQi"}, {"Content": "Great location!!

The experience was not at all pleasant.We booked a 'Superior double room with a view and TV ' and are yet tofigure out what is superior about this room. The room number was 37.It was hot for us in Italy, since we live in a much cooler Berlin. The AC was not working. They had disconnected the power supply since it was still not warm enough for them. Not something you expect when you pay 90 Euros a night!Since I couldn't sleep I kept the window open to let in some cooler air. Big mistake! Lot of mosquitoes also got in. There is a fairly busy road near by. So there was lot of noise too. At last at 1:00 AM I went down to the reception. They could do nothing about our situation. The person there gave a mosquito repellent mat. We put this on and soon the mosquitoes disappeared. The sound of vehicles remained. A bad night's sleep spoils your next day. This is exactly what happened to me. I was drowsy all day. The next day the called the AC technician and reconnected the power supply. The AC was working but it was just blowing air which was not cool. Clearly the compressor had gone bad. Again we let the window open, took another mosquito repellent mat from the reception and slept listening to the noise from the near by road.I am a budget traveller and travelled a dozen European counties. Thiswas my most expensive(90 euros a night) and unfortunately the worst stay. This room had a view of Florence old town. But we had to keep the windows closed in the mornings. In the mornings, when the toilets areheavily used, there is a strong smell of you-know-what if the windowsare open. Maybe a drainage pipe or septic tank had a leak.I wouldn't recommend this place especially for summers.

I was curious to check the latest reviews on Hotel Panorama just before leaving for my journey to Italy, and specifically to Florence, and almost panicked! What the hell I thought, all the past reviews seem to describe a good place and now, all of a sudden, such a bad one - something doesn't sound right - where is the truth??.Well, I found out myself. Now that I've been to it myself I have no doubts at all on Hotel Panorama's value.I understand we don't all see the world with the same eyes and that what may look beautiful to a person doesn't necessarily have the same effect on others, but still.....: a fact is a fact and there is no further story to that. As a regular tripadviser user I try to be as objective as possible when I write a review on a place I've stayed at clearly holding to my mind what kind of structure I'm talking about (in this case a 2 star budget hotel) in order value it correctly. Otherwise why bother at all? To vent my personal frustration in the case of a bad experience? Or, in the opposite case, to glorify a cowshed as the owner offered me a beer every night? Nope, believe me, not really.... And I truly believe it's the same for most reviewers or Tripadvisor wouldn't be so highly appreciated by users all over the world.But now to the hotel. It's position is quite good: a block away from the Accademia Gallery (the museum where the Michelangelo's astonishing original David stands) and maybe a 7-8 minutes easy walk from the Cathedral. River Arno and the Ponte Vecchio are another 10 minutes away passed the Duomo. So everything reasonably close I would say. I was assigned a room on the 4th level which was yes basic but perfectely functional and spotlessly clean. No private minibar in the room but fresh drinks available for guests at the front desk if needed (of course this doesn't mean you can use the refrigerator to store your private belongings in it - do I really have to explain why....???). Maybe other reviewers are used to lodging in 4-5 star hotels: if this is the case I wonder why they booked a 2 star budget hotel instead, huh.......? Back to the room: the view from it towards the Cathedral was really quite amazing. The rate was within EUR 80,00 per night for two persons (double room staying 3 nights) which I found fairly adequate. Last but not least: the staff was very friendly and provided a couple of very good suggestions for a nice evening only local people would know about.So, summing all the factors, I can definetely can say Hotel Panorama is an excellent choice in Florence for budget travellers.", "Date": "Sep 21, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR337067638", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good location We have just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel. We would describe the rooms as clean but very basic, the beds were comfortable, although our bathroom was in need of a new loo seat as this was badly cracked. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was basic but adequate. After requesting more tea and coffee on the first day - we do not function until we've had at least two cups of tea/coffee in a morning - the waitress brought us a large pot of coffee and extra tea bags the following morning as soon as we sat down. There was no balcony with our room - we were on the 2nd floor and our room looked onto the street and we would say that there was a lot of early morning noise! Hotel was well positioned for seeing all the sights - only a 10 minute walk from San Lorenzo (good little restaurants here), the Duomo etc. We would say it was farther from the railway station than anticipated and with baggage a taxi is essential! Also hotel is on 2nd floor of a building that also houses apartments. The lift was out of order on our arrival at lunchtime so we had to carry our cases up the stairs. Luckily the lift was working again later that day. We hope to return to Florence as it is a beautiful city but we probably would not return to this hotel.", "Date": "Sep 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR677752203", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Clean but basic Agree with other reviewers that this hotel provides value for money within a good central (ish) location for exploring Florence. However, I suspect that our room on the fourth floor was not one of the hotel's best. Whilst undoubtedly clean and upgraded in parts, it was a little shabby around the edges. The towel rail was hanging off the bathroom door and we could have done with a shower curtain. However, that being said, I would certainly recommend this hotel if you are looking for basic but clean accommodation at a reasonable price (We paid 70 Euros per night).

Was looking for a nice cheap hotel to stay in with my wife for five nights.No doubt i was blinded by the beautiful photos on the trip advisor web site.We were given a wonderful view of the duomo .The room was very spacious but reminded me of a school camp dorm.The tacky pictures and nasty dull wall coverings seemed out of place when compared to the view and the newly tiled bathroom.Nasty smelly pillows and a creacky sagging bed did nothing for our opinion of this hotel.The hotel is a decent hike from the train station.I thought it was in a poor position.There is very little in the way of resteraunts and the management would not allow me to put my alcohol in the reception fridge which meant after making the 15 min trek to by some beer it had allready gone warm.The breakfast was sparse even for european standards.One cup of coffee ,one small breadroll and a small pastry.I don't recommend this hotel and would not stay there again......even with the great views", "Date": "Sep 11, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR172561186", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "kuwaithammer"}, {"Content": "Excellent Value!!! I and my fiance stayed at Hotel Panorama for 3 nights earlier this month, during our roundtrip in Italy, basing our choice on the reviews we had previously read in TripAdvisor. The hotel was exactly as we expected: family-run and located in the centre of Florence short walks away from all the major points of interest. Our room was spotless and people at the front desk were very helpful giving us nice hints like only locals really can (superb restaurants choices for example). Truly, thinking what we have spent, I must say they have an excellent quality-service/price ratio: well done!
