It was an average stay..nothing spectacular. The rooms are average..nothing too wonderful. We had to speak to the manager due to several complaints..we had to ask for face towels; to have the coffee refilled every morning; to have the shampoo, conditioner, and body wash refilled; and to have the sheets for the crib replaced. When they came to the room to give me the sheets, they just gave them to me and didn't even put them on the bed. I then realized they weren't even crib sheets...they were sheets for a regular size bed. The first day we were there, the pool wasn't open because someone had broken glass in the pool and they had to drain it. They can't control that but after leaving at 5 am from Chicago..that sucked because i wanted to use the pool. Now, they make this awesome water that tastes like a Mojito without the alcohol. That was so good. I actually liked to see the cruise ships when they were docked. I had not seen them in person before so that was interesting. the cruise ships were always gone when the sun was getting ready to set. Overall, it was an ok hotel nothing wonderful.

I booked this vacation 3 months ago and I am not a newbie traveler. We are in the \"Christmas Tree Island Suite\" a \"Premium Oceanfront\" 2 Bedroom suite.

We had to ask for a small refrigerator to be brought the room as it is so sparse on furniture and amenties that it did not come equiped with one. The room is worn and tired not what I expected at all for $850 per night. Oh and the view? It 's beautiful when the cruise ships move out of the way, which has either been in the evening or now finally on the last morning of our stay. I know the response from management will be that I could check the schedule as to when the ships would be in port so I would know my view would be blocked as they did to a previous reviewer. The one day we had to take the skiff to Sunset Key ,we checked, were told the price waited for about 40 minutes to get the rest of our party together, went back and were told that the boats were sod out for the rest of the day. Called the concierge in the afternoon to book a cab for 5 people so we would not be late for a dinner reservation, show up, no cab. Luckily the bellman was able to call and get one over right away. The point I would to make is that some of the staff here deserves a wonderful review, the restaurant staff, Elliott who finally got us checked in after a 3 hour wait for our room (the prior desk was really quite perturbed when after 2 hours of waiting we checked to see if our room was ready and were frostily informed that no it was not and check in time is 400p even though our traveling companions room was ready at 1p and all of our luggage had been delivered there).

If the hotel had properly monitored the property this would not have been an issue and such a disappointment to the vacationers. The housekeeping staff was lovely and very friendly. In the advertisement that their sister hotel has a private beach that is available for use they do not tell you there is a $20.00 per person charge to take the ferry and use the beach or that the number of spaces at the beach are limited. The cruise ships do block the view and the crowds from the ships can be quite an inconvenience at times but for the most part is not an issue.

This is Paradise! The Hotel is beautiful, clean and well situated, in fact it is the best location in Key West period. All potential guests should always do their research before booking any hotel so it irks me to see complaints about a cruise ship sometimes blocking the view when all of the information can be found on the internet on sites like this. The pool and hot tub are surrounded by the hotel with steps up to the bar/patio which overlooks Mallory and the water- sunsets are spectacular right from the bar, The way the hotel is arranged is awsome because you're in the middle of the action yet the general public below cannot traipse through the property. The hotel pool and patio bar is staffed by experienced attentive bartenders and make something called a Key Lime Colada that is to die for. Watch the sunsets from the patio bar or have fun watching last minute cruise ship passengers running back to their ship because they lost track of time in one of the many establishments nearby. We usually drive down from Ft.Lauderdale airport to enjoy the scenery, the parking garage for the Westin is right next door and is multi level. Although you really don't even need a car in Key West it's easy to come and go because the room key gets you in and out quickly. The rooms are typical Westin, top of the line bedding and toiletries. Never was bothered by noise from adjoining rooms but if you leave your balcony door open, you may hear people at the patio during a wedding or other celebration. I usually close the door because I like A/C when I sleep. A day at Sunset Key can be arranged in the hotel lobby by getting a boat pass early in the morning, We've spent quiet days there and once flagged down a parasailing boat to go have a birds eye view of it all--Very cool!

Small issues with cleanliness (garbage under bed, and stains on walls and doors)...but I would imagine a hotel that has this type of turnover, it must be very difficult to keep it spotless.

When we had the doors closed and turned the AC unit on, it was difficult to hear them, but that is not how I planned to spend my time in Key West. A visit to the manager after our first night was handled efficiently with an offer to move us, and a complimentary breakfast. We opted not to move as we weren't sure if the next room would prove any more quiet than the last (the Manager agreed). She told me that I can always call down to the front desk and the security guys will quiet them down. My biggest issue is if a hotel of this caliber knows of the problem, security should be patrolling the halls/pool area at 1am to monitor the noise level. Waiting to disturb sleeping guests and have them call is not very pro active. Overall, this is a great choice of hotel. In the middle of it all, but probably quiet (when the kids aren't here).

Having been to Key West many times, I felt fortunate to stay at this particular hotel, because it's located both on the water and in a prime area for sunset festivites at Mallory Square. While ithe location is great, you should not stay here expecting a great ocean view from your room. Cruise ships block the view for oceanfront rooms and most rooms are \"partial ocean view\" anyway. We stayed in a partial ocean view room on the top (4th) floor behind the pool so we could see over the trees, and the ocean view was nice, but not reason enough to choose this hotel (it is on the expensive side). On the other hand, the outdoor patio is right on the water and in an area that is as good as it gets for sunset viewing in Key West. By Westin standards (I love Westin and expect a lot), this hotel did not meet my expectations for the price. Even though our room was huge, it was sparsely furnished and had a tiny bathroom. The bed was indeed heavenly, but the small bathroom had only a smallish shower with mediocre water pressure (no double shower head or rain shower here). Except for the large room size, small seemed to be the operative word here, as the window with the partial ocean view also was very small, as was the pool, which has a limited number of lounge chairs that--as is typical in many resorts--were all appropriated early each morning. There is no beach near the hotel except for the island (see below), so there were no options to just hang out on the beach or at the pool if you didn't grab a lounge chair at the crack of dawn. The Westin does have a small beach on an island and for a $20 per person fee, you can take a ferry to the island beach. However, occupancy is so limited that you have to be in line before 7:30 in the morning (and go then) to go. I recommend this hotel if you want to go to Key West for a couple of days and the evening and nightlife activities around Mallory Square and Duval Street are your priority.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cHad a great vacation in Key West!\u201d", "Author": "Mark F", "ReviewID": "UR125259620", "Content": "Front desk attendant Al Duncan made my day!

Stunning location right on Mallaroy Square, top of Duval St. Nice pool area (although be quick for a sunbed!). Several bars/restaurants overlooking the water with great food and cocktails and ability to watch the sunset away from the crowds as well as a private island and private beach you can book in advance with stunning sunset views. All in all a solid hotel in a great location but as some other guests have noted a few drawbacks particularly if booking ocean front rooms. These drawbacks didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother us but the one about ocean view rooms is really important \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were lucky with our room allocation, but others weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. I believe they are called \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOcean Front\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rather than \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcOcean View\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and this is because cruise ships are docked outside from about 7am to just before sunset (sometimes later apparantly, although not during our stay). This affects/blocks the view from the vast majority of ocean front rooms. We were lucky and were on honeymoon so were allocated a really spacious room in the block where the concierge is (away from the Reception Block) and closest to the Aquarium. Our room whilst partly obscured by the ships did still have a great ocean view, a view of the private island and we were able to watch the sunset from the balcony each evening. However, looking at the layout of the hotel the vast majority of the ocean front rooms would have been obstructed by the ship \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so be careful before paying the extra. Also, some ocean front rooms are on the ground floor and effectively step onto the boardwalk so If you are one of those people who worries about others having easy access to your room steer clear from. Personally, I think they need to start thinking about clearer promotion of the Ocean Front rooms as it could really upset somepeople given the considerable extra charges levied for these room types. Most people are understanding if told in advance, but it would be a nasty shock if you didn't know. It isn't cheap and when compared to other hotels of a similar standard in other cities it seems overpriced, but compared to Key West its about right.

We booked an oceanfront room, but no one mentioned that the only view we would have would be a cruise ship right in front of us everyday. I've stayed in some very nice Westins before, but now would be very hesitant to ever book them again since I can no longer trust their brand. Clearly this property is well below the standards I expected from the Westin. It was more on par with a Hampton Inn for 3 times the price. In fact, after making mention of that comparison, a member of our group had a towel in his room with a Hampton tag, so it appears that maybe they did buy a Hampton property and just slap a Westin name on it. The room was small, dated and uncomfortable, and the small balcony was directly above the walkway where all the cruise ship people walked back and forth, so it was often very noisy. Again, had we been paying Hampton Inn prices, this would have been okay, but we could have gone many places in the Caribbean and stayed at a much nicer place for the same price. The location is convenient, but very crowded and noisy when a cruise ship is in port (as it was almost constantly during our stay). If the only good thing you can say about a hotel is it's near someplace to watch a sunset, I don't think that is very high praise. Also the service was terrible. The first night, after watching the sunset (which was wonderful), we decided to eat at the hotel's seaside bar/restaurant. We got there at 7:00 and as soon as our food arrived, the server asked if she could go ahead and bring the check (it was maybe 7:30). The food was mediocre and it was clear that we would not continue to be served. Before 8:00 they came and took away the lanterns from our table. We were told we could \"continue to sit there\", but clearly, they were closing. If they planned to close by 8:00, they should have told us when we arrived. Throughout the property, the service was consistently poor and apathetic. We did go over to Sunset Key a couple of times and enjoyed that experience. The service was good, the food was a little better and the beach was fairly nice. The beach drink service was slow, but friendly. Although I didn't see inside of the cottages, they looked very nice and the pool was much better than the main Westin property. Overall, it was much more in keeping with the Westin brand than the main hotel.

He wasn't able to give us a room with a better view on our first night - but offered us the room we were in (he considered Oceanfront, we considered Marina view) at a $60.00 a night lower rate - and the next day he was able to get us into a room with a better view (which TRULY was an amazing Ocean front view). Once the details of the room was worked out - our stay was PERFECT. The customer service was excellent - the room was nicely appointed with the Westin Bed, a great walk in -up to date tile shower and an amazing view with a balcony. We ate breakfast at the restaurant and the food and service was very good. The Concierge was extremely helpful in booking our excursions. Housekeeping made up the rooms based on our schedule. Our room (361) faced the west - and our view was wonderful. We could see Mallory square and had an absolutely perfect view of the Sunset and the Sunset Celebration. We enjoyed sunset while sitting on the balcony with our own champagne! Cruise ships do arrive daily - and our view was occasionally obstructed - but they generally arrived around 8AM and were always gone by 6PM (before sunset). We were far enough north - toward Mallory square so that our view was only completely obstructed by the cruise ships on one day - when the HUGE Carnival Magic came into port. The views of the cruise ships were even entertaining. The Air Conditioners are pretty noisy - but the weather was pretty mild while we were there...so we just turned it off when we were in the room and on the balcony. The location was absolutely perfect - and easy walk to all of our favorites - including all the hot spots on Duval, Mallory Square, the Historic Seaport Harbor Walk...and Blue Heaven!

With that in mind the Westin had clean rooms, flat screen television(it is 2012) I like for the bedding to be white and high thread count at least 400. The bed being comfortable is very important because my husband has a bad back. I don't understand why properties don't focus more on the comfort of the bed. The bed at the Westin was about a 8 from 1-10. Which I have never given a 10 and very few 9. It is very important how the front desk checks you into your room. It seems like if that is bad, your stay usually is bad. I like to feel they care if I am comfortable and happy, this seems hard for most front desk. I have read the reviews about the front desk and manager. They must have had a meeting because my experience with both were good. I was check into my room my Elliot whom is 7 feet tall so you can't miss him.

The food is generally good but lacks variety. The travel desk is ok.

Once we were able to use it, we could only stay in for a few minutes because our eyes were burning from the chlorine...good to know it was clean, but unbearable.

There was also a bad/weird smell in the hallway the entire time we were there. We were also a little disappointed with the staff working in the hotel, I expect for a hotel the caliber of the Westin that they would encourage their staff to say hi and smile and be friendly to guest.

We stayed with free resort nights over thanksgiving weekend through the star woods program. My husband and I are avid travelers and he is platinum with star woods, had we paid to stay my review would be much worse. I looked up the cost of the room we were staying in and it was about $500/night. That's totally ridiculous for this hotel, other than the best location I can think of in Key West, the hotel is lacking in many other departments, mainly service. It's true that the staff stand around and act like they don't really care. When we arrived we asked for an upgrade and they told us the hotel was sold out for the weekend, I checked online before arriving and knew this was not the case. After reminding them several times that we were platinum, surprise they upgraded us to an ocean view room, weird how they went from completely full to having a magical extra room?! The young man who was first helping us really had no idea what he was doing and every time I went through the lobby I saw him and he always appeared to be standing around with no idea what to do. The valet staff acted like they were there to hangout and chat with each other instead of help guests and we rented scooters, parked them ourselves and were charged $11/night per scooter to have them \"valeted\" that was absurd! When departing as we we're walking out my husband was struggling with several bags and one of the valet or concierge staff (not sure bc a lot of guys were just standing around) just stood there and watched us he didn't even bother to help with the door which another guest noticed and opened. Overall the rooms were okay but have probably seen better days. The views from our ocean front porch were fantastic and despite other traveler reviews about the cruise ships blocking the view we didn't mind even when the gargantuan celebrity cruise ship was parked in front of our room for a day. The people watching from our porch was great. It's a very busy area so if you don't like a bustling atmosphere I would not recommend staying here. The pool and hot tub were okay, nothing spectacular and I would say the same for the rest of the common areas in the hotel. The lobby was boring and the water they offered in the lobby was always either empty or there were no cups. Seems like such a simple thing that most hotels never seem to have an issue with, I'm pretty sure there were at least ten staff standing around doing nothing about 90% of the time so they could have easily filled up the water. However, again, the staff just don't seem to care. If I were the manager here I would be totally embarrassed by the overall poor staff morale and lack of care for guest experience. I would not pay to stay here, but given that it was free it was a lot easier to swallow. Watch out for the nickle n diming bc they get you with things like parking, which they tried to charge us $55 for and we didn't even park there for 24 hours. Really what this hotel needs is a good kick in the management and staffs rear, because it has such great potential to be an amazing resort, but is being brought down by it's staffing. We also took the opportunity to go over to sunset key on the boat and had breakfast there twice at latitudes, would highly recommend it, sunset key is a private island/resort owned also by westin but is top notch and unfortunatly does not participate in the free resort nights! As guests at Westin you can also go to the beach at sunset key for $20/person, however you have to get beach tickets from the concierge, they are first come first serve and they only give out so many per day which is annoying but also keeps the beach quiet and serene feeling. Definitely worth the $ to go to sunset key for the beach and the restaurant, also nice to walk around and look at the cute cottages and houses on the island, it's really a one of a kind place! Too bad the same can't be said for the Westin key west resort and marina. Ps my dad and step mom were also staying on their boat in the marina at $100/night and said it was a total let down, not to mention the marina is not protected and very choppy from all the boats coming and going, I'm still nautious from the 30 minutes I spent on the boat sitting in the marina! We also tried the bistro at the hotel for thanksgiving dinner, it was a buffet and while over priced at $40/person it was really good food! So in the end, if you get a deal or your using free nights or points it's worth it, but if I had to out of pocket $1500 for 3 nights here I would be highly disappointed, honestly the Westin at Detroit Metro Airport is better in terms of staff and ambience. For what it costs to stay here, you can get a bungalow over the water in Bora Bora for that kind of cash.

The area was bustling as cruise ship passengers were scurrying everywhere on foot, bikes and small motorized vehicles. We arrived the Westin and entered the lobby. A few awkward glances from the front desk staff and we were greeted by an un-uniformed staff member with \"what can I help you with\". We went through the normal transactions of checking in and then the front desk staff member said \"I need to speak to my manager about your upgrade\". As a Platinum SPG member we are entitled to upgraded rooms when available. I've never experienced the front desk staff leave to check in with a manager and reflected on all of the reviews I've read here on Trip Advisor which spoke of this property being frugal with upgrades. The staff member arrived back and said \"We got slammed with the holiday so we can't upgrade you. We don't have any rooms\". I noted that I had read a lot of reviews on Trip Advisor and FlyerTalk that this property doesn't like to upgrade Platinum members. He said \"I don't know, we don't have any rooms, do you want to speak to my manager\"? I told him that online there were plenty of rooms available. He said he would check with his manager again and went back to the office. I pulled out my iPhone SPG app while he was away and pulled up Ocean view, Ocean front and Suites that were all available. He came back and said \"I don't have anything now so you'd have to wait...so why don't I put you in your originally booked room\". I said that we were happy to wait. He asked me what my SPG app was showing as available and I listed Ocean view, Ocean front and Suites all available. He then looked at his computer and said \"let me see what we have\" and then called his manager from the desk phone. At this point he must have received permission to upgrade us as he muttered phrases including my name, upgrade, Ocean front, etc.\". After the phone call he said he could indeed upgrade me and would put me in a \"high room\". This was the most awkward check-in experience I've every had. Usually hotels are very welcoming and friendly. Here I had to fight for something that my status with the SPG program should automatically give us, if available, and it was very available. We were put in a second floor Ocean front room in the \"main building\". I wouldn't call this a high floor but the room was very nice and the view was not bad either. As other contributors have noted, this hotel is right in front of an active cruise dock. The room we were in, 261, provided both a view of the ship and the water while views from the annex building of the hotel are almost completely obstructed when a ship is in port. There were a lot of passersby on the promenade in front of our room. If you're looking for a private and quiet experience this may not be the hotel for you. A highlight of the property is Sunset Key Beach. For $20, which includes a ferry ride to and from the Key and beach access, we were able to enjoy serene sunbathing. We were pleased with the experience on the beach. It was very quiet and there were few other people on the beach. We also had an enjoyable room service breakfast on Thanksgiving morning. Not the best food I've had but it was good. I think the bottom line with this property is to not go in with any expectations. As you can see on the forum there are very mixed reviews of this property. We took our chances and, in the end, our feelings on the property are also mixed. They clearly need some assistance in customer service as this was evident in both my stay and in many other contributor's feedback. I've read from the marketing & social media manager, who comments on contributor reviews here, state that the property meets Westin and SPG standards. As a customer with about 100 Starwood stays I would say that this property does not meet the standards I've seen met in other properties all over the world. They should take some of their guests constructive feedback to make an OK property a great property.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cNice and comfortable hotel, Poorly staffed\u201d", "Author": "kt127", "ReviewID": "UR121093981", "Content": "I had a two night stay here during the week of Thanksgiving. The hotel is excellently located in the downtown area and on the water. The cruise ships dock behind the hotel, so if a ship is in your view will be greatly blocked. However the ships generally leave in the later afternoon around 5, before the magnificent sunset. There are plenty of things to do within a short walk, including bike, boat, and jet ski rentals. I recommend the island jet ski tour, takes about 2 hours and lots of fun. Plenty of restaurants, shops and bars within a short walk, all geared for the tourist. This town is one big happy hour. Back to the hotel. After a lengthy wait in a line of two people, I finally checked in. I was a little early (1pm) and my room wasn't ready yet so they took my cell number and called within the hour to let me know my room was ready. In the mean time, I asked where the restaurant was located. I was told take the elevator around the corner to the second floor. Did that, nothing but conference rooms. I go back down and talk to the same young lady - I asked for a restaurant and you said it's on the second floor? No I didn't say that, I told you the concierge is on the second floor - the restaurant is outside and to the left. Okay. So off I go again with my roll-aboard bag in tow, take a left and walk all around the entire hotel. No restaurant. Lot's of shops and vendor stalls, but no restaurant. Starting to get a little peeved, so this time I walk past the front desk and ask one of the valet parking attendants outside for directions to the restaurant. Oh the restaurant is in the other building - you have to walk across the courtyard, then through the hotel, than walk past the pool, and then you'll find it. I ate at Bistro 254 twice - once for lunch and once for brunch. On both occasions the food was good and tasty, as were all my meals in Key West. Nothing extraordinary, but good. Both restaurant visits were marked by extremely slow service, almost to the point I felt ignored. On both visits, the routine was to let you wait a while, then take your order, bring your food, let you eat and sit a while, then return to refill your drink and ask if you're ready for the check. No automatic water or coffee refills, no checking in to see if everything is okay. Bottom line - decent food, reasonable prices for waterfront dining, and below average service during not overly busy times (no lines for a table, several empty tables). The room was nice and comfortable. I was upgraded to a suite with a balcony with a partial water view. Bed was very comfortable, typical of Westin. Very clean room as well. Hotel decor, carpeting , etc. was dated and worn, pretty much in line with Key West as a whole, and definitely in need of refurbishment.

The combination of location and the beauty of the property makes it our favorite place to stay in Key West. The Westin is right next to Mallory Square and about a block from Duval Street, yet it's quiet and removed from the noise and crowds. On the opposite side of the hotel from Mallory Square is the marina and Truman Annex -- if you'd like a quiet walk. It's also about a 6 minute walk from the waterfront area. For us, the location could not be better, and we were able to avoid having to take a cab or pedi-cab during our entire stay in Key West. The property is simply beautiful and appears to be relatively new. We loved the architecture and the landscaping around the pool area. Although the room was expensive and a bit small, we've come to expect that in Key West, where space is at a premium, especially in a good location - and we think it was totally worth the cost. Westin even has its own sunset celebration, complete with food, drinks, and performers, so you don't even have to walk over to Mallory Square. The restaurant on the water side (Bistro 245) was excellent, and you can eat while watching the sunset, or just enjoying the view. There are a number of nice shops at the Westin, and it is very close to the customs house (now the Museum of Art & History), the aquarium, the Mel Fisher museum, and the Audubon house, and the Conch Train depot.

Two years ago, we decided to not return based on the terrible service we received--but we were lured back again by the \"heavenly bed\" (which is the only decent thing about this place). Two years ago, I was very sick with the stomach flu and after 2 days of being unable to eat, I thought I could try a scrambled egg and sent my husband to the restaurant to see if they could make me some dry toast and a scrambled egg. The restaurant refused, saying it was not breakfast time. So what! Here we are spending 3,000+ on your hotel and your guest isn't feeling well! How much would it take to scramble an egg? But because I have a very bad back, we decided to give the Westin one more chance this year. We specifically requested that our \"ocean front\" room be far from the cruise ships (because this was another problem the previous trip--our \"ocean front\" room's view was of UGLY cruise ships! We never saw one decent sunset because of these big ugly monstrosities of boats. When we arrived a few weeks ago, we (again) asked about being spared the cruise ships and the person at the front desk told us that while cruise ships would be stopping in the day, they would not be there for the evening sunset. That was a bold faced LIE as our view was marred EVERY NIGHT of six except ONE. I ate room service one night and I was so disgusted by the way it looked and tasted that I felt sick afterward--after only eating 2 bites or so. And again, the service was poor. I called at 9:45 and was told I could not order from the late night menu because it wasn't yet 10:00. Then they said I could order from the lunch menu (which had closed hours before--supposedly). I guess they wanted to get rid of their old food because what they served me tasted like what I would imagine rejected prison food would taste like. Blech and double blech. Stay at the Hyatt, which is a MUCH nicer hotel. We stayed there last year and will stay there from now on (although my husband and I are trying to buy a place there and we can get our own heavenly ed!). I really don't recommend this place.

Just booked this property on a whim last night, despite some of the reviews I have read. While our stay has not taken place yet, we are excited to try it out. On our last trip to Key West, I woke up early one morning and popped in to the Westin. I asked the front desk if it was okay if I walked around the property since I was thinking about booking it for our next trip. The lady said that for security reasons, only registered guests could access the pool area, etc. (No problem..nice knowing they are looking out for the safety of their guests). Then she asked me to wait just a moment and she got on the phone. Upon hanging up, she said she would give me a brief tour of the property and an unoccupied guest room. I found the property to be very nice and the room to be spectacular so I said \"I'll be back\". So, I can't help but wonder why so many people seem to complain about minor things like no continental breakfast...this is not a business hotel. Relax. You're on vacation. Most (reasonable) people on vacation are not looking to choke down a piece of toast as if they were on their way to a business meeting And all this whining about cruise ships coming into port?? Kinda reminds me of people who build a house in the flight plan of the airport and then complain about the noise. And people should also keep in mind...the manager, the housekeeper and the front desk staff do not sleep in the rooms. If something isn't right, report it to the appropriate person. These people are not mind readers. In addition to overall service, I think it is only fair to also review a property based on the responsiveness of the staff to a (warranted) complaint. They are not going to go out and move the cruise ships. And if you have to strain your neck to see the sunset because you booked a partial ocean view, well, they cannot be held responsible for moving the sun either. Again, I booked this hotel because the lady at the front desk went out of her way to \"sell\" me on the property. I doubt she gets a commission for doing that. She provided stellar service to me when I wasn't even her guest! So unless this place has gone downhill in a major way in just the past 4 months, I expect we will have a perfect time.

No repair. Just moved it up a bit. The hallways smell musty and old. The walls are dinged and dingy. In general the property is in poor repair.

It's very difficult to build in Key West so a lot of these hotels are much older properties and simple renovations of older properties. The Westin is very much the same. For Key West it is very good, clean and updated. It's located right where the cruise ships are dock, so the walk into old historic Key West (Duval Street) is literally 1minute.

Unfortunately, the next couple of days were not. Not only was she not working, but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any wait staff. To get a drink we had to walk through the pool area & up to the bar. Not to sound spoiled, but for $300 a night on Labor Day weekend, the Westin should\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had wait staff for the pool area. The area was packed with guests & they were also frustrated! The icing on the cake was when a young couple decided to have inappropriate behavior in the pool. When the couple exited the pool, the young lady was bleeding. She proceeded to bleed all over the chair cushions. About ten of the guests told the bartenders & pool manager. The pool manager only removed the cushion, but did nothing about the fact she bleed in the pool. Nothing happened until 2 hrs later when senior management came out, roped off the pool & shocked the pool. We were told to stay out of it for a couple of hours. What a joke! Only after complaining, we were given a free dinner at Bistro 245. The only person that was kind to the guests throughout this entire process was Mark Vose. He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a great guy & he provided us, along with other guests, dinner vouchers. After that incident, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go back to the pool.

I did alot of research on hotels in the area before I booked with Westin. The location is fantastic and the Westin had a great reputation (or so I thought). After arriving in Ft. Lauderdale and driving for 4 hours to Key West, I was very excited to arrive at the Westin and get my vacation started. I'm a new SPG member and I just opened a SPG amex card because I hear good things about SPG hotels and their reputation. Not at this Westin!!! The front desk staff was somewhat standoffish. They were not the friendliest but this was the least of our problems at this hotel. We got to the room and the door opened and all I saw was the most gorgeous ocean views. I was so happy. We got into the room started looking around and that feeling started to dissipate. The lampshade had what looked like blood on it and was bent and beat up, the walls were badly scuffed and dirty with wheels from suitcases and hand prints, the toilet paper holder was broken, chipped wood furniture and their were other peoples hairs all over the bathroom. My friends and I were upset but we were doubting our concerns. As mentioned earlier this was a big splurge for us and we decided that it was unacceptable. We contacted the front desk who then sent the bell hop to give us keys to a new room We asked the bell hop if he wanted to see our concerns in the room and he did not seem to care. The new room was not much better at all. There was no blood on the lampshade but the walls were severely scuffed and dirty and in desperate need of a paint job. We were now really upset. A really nice housekeeping manager (Anthony or Tony??) came to see us because we said this is unacceptable. The housekeeping manager showed us a 3rd room but it was not ocean front and it was not much better than the others. We settled on room #2 with the dirty walls but I was not happy about our decision. I left for the pool for a bit to try to enjoy myself. The pool and pool area is gorgeous. The pool bathroom on the other hand was disgusting. It smelled like a urinal. We got back to the room and found a fruit basket from the staff as an apology for the issues we were experience. The fruit basket had moldy grapes!!! We were asking ourselves....Is this a joke? We started to get increasingly upset. We then went back into the room to shower to get ready for the night and the drain was clogged. I practically took a bath!!! The thing that really put me over the edge was when I went to blow dry my hair and the heat setting did not work. I was really really upset and my night was spoiled because of all the issues. We let the staff know of all of our concerns. The following morning the hospitality manager called us and we told him how upset we were. He said he would comp one night. This made me feel somewhat better about being in the dirty room for 3 nights. I then tried to enjoy the rest of my trip. The rest of the trip was nice but I could not fully get over the issues with the hotel. Upon leaving, we got a bill with charges for all 3 nights. I was upset again. I contacted the front desk they said to come to the front desk to resolve. The very helpful new desk attendant was great. I cannot remember his name but he was fantastic. In addition the Concierge was fantastic and the housekeeping manager was also great. Everyone else could careless about us. I just wanted to wrap this up by saying that I typically don't complain. I've always just \"sucked it up\" but I have to say the hotel is not worth the the money.

She was frazzled to begin with but even more so when I asked about our entitled upgrade. She determined that we were a \"problem\" because we were staying \"so long.\" I must be mistaken when I thought that hotels actually wanted long-term guests, especially at a resort destination such as Key West. She pointed us in the general direction of our room, located in an adjacent building, and again, was offered no help with our luggage. I should point out that while this seems a bit picky, the front desk help was dressed in a casual shirt and pants. I expect to see that at the Comfort Inn, but at the Westin, I expect something more professional, even in a resort town such as Key West. Our room was tiny and located on the first floor, with the busy pier directly in front of us. We would have been unable to open our sliding doors or draperies during any time of the day or night. Again, not the best room for someone staying for an entire week.

We ended up choosing the construction area since we wouldn't be in the room too much during the day. We booked a couples massage for one afternoon and on the day of our massage, no one showed up! I guess the Concierge forgot to actually book it with the masseuse. We were upset b/c we could have booked a water trip, cruise, etc during that time. After we were told sorry, but that was it, I decided that this was not good enough. This was our honeymoon! We asked that they reserve an area for us on the Sunset Deck to watch the sunset...which they did, and it was very nice. The only good thing about this hotel is the location and the name.

I checked the reviews here before my trip and found the experience to be very accurately reflected. The location was really wonderful for walking about and experiencing Key West including restaurants, Mallory Square sunset and street performers, Duval Street and Marina shops. The marina area was very quiet at night and good for sleeping. Upon check-in we were upgraded to an oceanview room. There were cruise ships almost wholly covering our oceanview 2 of the 5 days we were there. They did leave by the evening and we had a lovely view of the marina and ocean from our balcony every evening/night. I suggest that if this concerns you, you should check the cruise ship schedule. I found it to be only a mild inconvenience, but my have been more upset, if I had missed the view say 4 of 5 days. Or planned on spending lots of daytime/mornings out on the balcony :) We checked in on Sunday, May 22 and were checked in by an extremely pleasant trainee front desk clerk and trainer. Our check-in experience was great. The 'trainer' walked us out the lobby door to direct us to our rooms, held doors, etc. The check-in process met or exceeded my expectations. We did check around a few nearby lots to see if we could find a more reasonable parking rate than $20/night, but the best we could find would have been $25 and I'm not sure that would include in/out priveleges. So while the parking rate may sound high, I think this is due to location rather than anything else. Now, as I said the other reviews are true to form, so there were some areas that fell short of my expectations for this hotel. Housekeeping: There were several details missed which I would not expect. One day after our room had been serviced, our dirty wine glasses were not replaced with fresh wine glasses. Another day, we selected that our room be serviced anytime except from 2:30 to 4:30 which it was, but housekeeping still knocked on the door mid-afternoon nap. Thankfully, we had locked the door for privacy. Room servicing did tend to be late in the day unless specifically requested otherwise. The last day we did not get any washcloths at all and had to substitute handtowels in their place. We were also charged nearly $20 for mini-bar purchases although we had not taken anything out of the fridge (this charge was refunded promptly on check-out). One evening in the middle of our stay we decided to take the car out to see the non-touristy part of the island. We went to get out of the garage and our key would not work in the garage. We tried both keys and both gates (meaning, we had to have several people back up behind us twice). I went to the front desk and explained the problem as politely as I could without totally hiding the minor frustration of having everyone back-up. I would have expected a minimum comment of 'Sorry, for the inconvenience.' But friendliness did not seem to be on her agenda. She simply mumbled that it must have become uncoded somehow and handed me some fresh keys which worked without issue. In fairness there were two other pairs of guests that she had also been assisting just prior to me and I do not know what issues she may have been assisting them with. But I expect the desk clerk at a nice resort to maintain a level of friendliness even when multi-tasking. When we checked-out the same desk clerk (trainer) that had been there on day one was in the lobby and opened the door for us again. A different desk clerk checked us out (removing the erroneous minibar charge). The check-out experience was generally good and went smoothly.

Guest rooms were fine, but the lobby was miserable. And there was no water for guests in the lobby. (2) The front desk staff was, on five occasions I can recall personally, stand-offish, difficult, arrogant, just unhelpful and unfriendly.Just one example: I asked the desk clerk if I could leave my outgoing postcard for mailing. She replied 'if you are a guest here and it has postage' (!!!). (3) The pool looks much better on the web and in photos than in person. It's on the smaller side and lounge chairs are crowded about it. Bar service by the pool was great. Water in a large not so pretty thermos dispenser was available one day but not on two others. (4) Self-parking at the garage for guests is $20/day. Ouch. (5) There is no hotel shuttle to the airport, not even for a fee. To the plus side, the location is great for walking the town and historic district. We enjoyed lunch at the hotel's indoor air conditioned restaurant and libations on the outdoor deck watching sunset celebration. The highlight of our stay was the $20 per person daytrip by boat to Sunset Key, Westin's island with rental cottages 10 minutes away by water. Lovely meal there at Latitudes restaurant and nice beach... although the concierge neglected to tell us we needed water shoes to be able to walk into the water, the sand floor is covered with pebbles that hurt.

Lots to do around the hotel, and because it is in such a historic part of Key West, there are probably many limitations on what can and can't be done to the hotel. We only stayed one night. Here are a few things to consider: 1) It is only 3-4 floors, and depending on what type of room you have (we had an ocean view next to the marina), it could be very noisy at night. There is another Westin building nearby, and if you stay there and your room overlooks the pool, you could have the same issue. 2) The lobby is small and unimpressive with only two check in stations, it is always appeared to be full, and the concierge was in a different building. Weird. 3) The AC and windows were terrible. The AC was quite old and loud and kept kicking on throughout the night. The drapes could only be closed half way, and the other half had plantation blinds. What this meant is that when the sun came up, light would come through even when the blinds were closed....no sleeping in. 4) The hallways and cleaning had a lot to be desired. As we'd walk to our rooms on both days, bags of either clean or dirty linens could be seen in the hallway or jamming the door...without a maid's cart next to it. They looked like they were simply abandoned. 5) When I requested a late check out the night before, I was told I had to call back the next day because they day shift decided. When I called back the next morning, I did receive one after explaining I was a gold member. This is the first time I experienced not being able to request late check outs in advance.

You can rent bikes & motor cars. The pool isn't large but it was nice and private. The bartender at the pool bar was okay. The one thing the pool area needed was some nice music playing.

Staying at the Westin conjured up images in our heads of lush and grandeur, plush pillows and sunset views as the cool breeze flowed around us. I'm not sure how that got in my head but the reality couldn't have been further away from that. We arrived for our three night stay to our first floor room which was dark, dingy, and poorly spaced out (it was smaller than our expectations to begin with but somehow still managed to waste significant space). My main issue was that the combination of the recycled, recirculated air along with the intense smell of alcoholic cleansers made it legitimately feel like a stale hospital sick ward, certainly less than pleasant to be in, much less sleep in. Being literally on the ground floor poolside, there was no way to open a window in addition to it not feeling very private. Upon asking to be moved to a higher floor, where at least I could perhaps open a window, I was told no other room was available. I'm not usually a complainer, but I just couldn't help but feeling like I was completely taken as I checked out with a runny nose, a sore throat, and a $400/night bill (which somehow is on the low end of what people pay there (or so I was told)). Don't get me wrong, Key West is a fun and lovely city, we had a good time and we did enjoy some beautiful sunsets; however, our room at the hotel did nothing to better our stay there. In summary, if you want to wildly overpay for a stale room that makes you feel like you're in some combination of a motel and a hospital, the Westin is for you. Otherwise, I'm certain there must be better values out there for your money.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bronx, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "christina106", "ReviewID": "UR98280365", "Content": "I would not bother with an ocean view room b/c there is a cruise ship nblocking some times.

The courtyard had beautiful palm trees and vegetation, so the view was very relaxing. I would recommend getting a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor, so you won't have people walking in front of your room. The room was large, with a great balcony, flat screen tv, and a comfy bed. We ate at the Bistro and had a great lunch. I had a grouper sandwich ( I know, a fish sandwich doesn't sound exciting), but it was one of the best sandwiches I've had lately. We also ate breakfast there, and it was good. It's nice eating there because it's part of the hotel and the ocean views were great. I have trouble walking long distances, so it was great to be close to all the action in Key West. While in Key West we rented an electric car for 4 hours, which was great because parking is an issue in the city and it's easy to park and travel down the narrow side roads to look at the pretty houses.

Full disclosure: last minute trip thus we were willing to pay a premium as well as forgo some due diligence. Got the Hemingway Suite. This included a large bedroom with it's own 3/4 bath (small, cramped); a huge bedroom with a full bath (a bit cramped as well); a moderately large sitting room with sofa bed; and a useless, large entry room. All the rooms looked as if furniture had been removed and the remaining furniture did not fit i.e. small flat screen tv perched on top of a dresser so far away from the bed due to room size the tv looked like an after thought. This was the case in both bedrooms. We had a total of four (4) verandas and since we were on the 4th floor we had good views of the pool and partial view of the ocean....EXCEPT when the cruise ships were docked. The hotel was dirty in general with little evidence of cleaning in public spaces during the 5 days we were there. The same dirt and bits of paper remained in the elevators the whole time. Things that needed fixing often did not get fixed i.e. toilet paper holder. Maid service was OK but it was difficult to time one's activities during the day as the service times varied considerably. Communicating with the maids was difficult given the low levels of understanding of English as a second language for most of the staff. During our first 48-72 hours at the Westin there was intense, intermittent cigarette smoke mixed with marijuana smoke seeping into one of our bedrooms. Management was sympathetic but was unable to accomplish much for at least two days. This made one of our bedrooms a smoking room and the only way to alleviate the stench was by turning on the AC (very high) and opening the veranda door (a poor option since the temperature in the Keys was quite cold for those few days). Please note that management freely admitted that other customers in other rooms had also complained about the smoke but that they were unable to locate the source and essentially 'we're sorry'. Along with the smoke smell a dog in an adjacent room barked intermittently (left alone by owners despite hotel policy not to do that). While this didn't bother me or my wife to much (sounded like our dogs at home) this could make a room difficult to sleep in for many people. Food at the hotel restaurant/room service was average to mediocre and given the prices was a pathetic value proposition. The restaurant servers were sloppy and overworked. The silver ware was dirty frequently. The only good thing about food on the trip is that Key West has great food options. This doesn't help much when you have to eat at the hotel for one reason or another. The pool is quite small and is set between the wings of the hotel. This means that exposure to the sun is relatively limited given that configuration. This is ironic since most people go to such a locale for the sun in large part. The bartenders servicing the pool/outdoor area were good. The drink sizes were skimpy, prices high (surprise surprise). One CONCERN was the ability of anyone from the nearby boardwalk (heavy foot traffic) to gain access to the bar above the pool as there was LITTLE TO NO SECURITY PRESENCE. This is an issue in general at any resort/hotel but in Key West one only has to read the papers to understand that they do have a bit of a problem in this regard. This is potentially compounded by the frequent docking of the cruise ships during the week with many of the passengers and crew milling about quite near the Westin. The concierge service was uninspiring and was in fact misleading on several issues that mattered to us. One example was dinner for New Year's Eve, a difficult reservation to make by any standard. The concierge told us that our top choice for that evening did not take reservations. I asked the owner of that restaurant who stated that in fact they did take reservations for New Years Eve (but of course were filled by the time we sorted that out). Perhaps the best feature of the Westin in Key West is the location. It is very close to the Truman Annex, a quiet residential area that is wonderful to stroll through. The Truman White House is available for daily tours and is quite interesting. It is within the Annex and quite close to the Westin though well hidden from view by large palms and other vegetation. The Westin is also located near Duval street (Key West's mini-answer to Bouron St in New Orleans). It is also close enough to walk to the real marina at the opposite end of Front St where one finds a large variety of great seafood oriented restaurants and bars. One has to wonder as one walks from the Westin to the marina whether the Hyatt one passes would be a better place to stay? Another good feature of the Westin were the beds (as usual) which are some of the most comfortable at any hotel/resort in the world. At the end our stay we realized that we had a great trip though it was generally in spite of the short comings of the Westin rather than due to any significant number of positive features of the resort. In essence, the Westin Key West resort is a lot like an expensive PIT STOP and I cannot recommend this resort hotel.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "nursewebb", "ReviewID": "UR90679649", "Content": "Great Key West location.

The first issue was that although I requested a higher floor room, they put me on the ground floor. The second was the fact that the alarm clock was set to the wrong time, and housekeeping never bothered to update it (this happens at a lot of hotels, and even more annoying when the alarm was set by a previous guest and not shut off by housekeeping, as should be standard checklist procedure). The final issue was the most troublesome. I had requested an early wakeup call the morning I was leaving and never received it. When expressing my displeasure with the person at the front desk when checking out, she called someone and he said he called me but I hung up, which is a blatant lie. When I told the individual I didn't receive a call, she just shook her head and said no, you did as I just confirmed.

Very nice location. The hotel it's self was nice and I have no complaints other than a dirty carpet in the room. The concierge was very helpful with any questions I had as well as was the front desk personel. Thats about all I can muster for the good because the trip was ruined by the managers and the over all customer service. First impression are everything and I should have stuck to that advise. When I originally called to book the room I asked if there was anyway to tell me if my view would be blocked by a cruise ship (read several reviews with this issue). The person told me that there was no way of knowing and that she had no clue as to where I could get this information. Made no attempt to help me finding the issue. By the way, I googled it and found the info in 30 seconds. Because of this encounter I decided not to stay at the Westin. After looking around at other places I found that the Westin was the cheapest, so I went against my better judgement and to save a buck booked the room at the Westin. Again the hotel is nice and the only issue I had while staying there was the fact that the carpet in the room was dirty and caused my 12 month old to have black knees and feet from craulling around (front desk told upon check out). Here is where my bad review really kicks in and the fact that I will pay the extra money and stay at the Ocean Key resort or Pier House next time. I checked out on a Sunday and paid $500 of my $700 bill with cash. The rest went onto my Debit card. Upon getting home that evening and checking my bank account balance I discovered that there were two pending charges for $678 and $250. I contacted the Westin manager, explained the problem and she told me that she was not sure why there were two seperate pending charges but that they should be released back to my account on Monday. On Tuesday the charges were still pending so I called back. This time I spoke with the director of operation, Joe Bru. Prior to doing this I called my bank and they stated that they were just waiting on Westin to release the charges and the money would be placed back in my account. Again I explained the problem to Joe. Joe's response was, verbatom \"let me get the sign from the front desk so I can read it to you\". He then read me the statement from the sign that states that it could take the Westin 7-14 to release pending charges back to an account. For approximately 10 minutes I went back and forth with Joe on the fact that $900 was being held from my account by the Westin after completely settling my bill. The only response he could provide me was that I would need to be patient and allow them the 7-14 period to get the money released. At no time did Joe ask me for my information to verify that my reservation was properly checked out of their system. I finally asked him if he wanted my name in order to check that I properly checked out. I ended the conversation with asking Joe if there was anything he could do to fix the problem and stop me from never staying at this hotel again and his responce was, again verbatom \"No, you will just have to be patiant and allow the 7-14 days to pass\". I have stayed at many hotels in my time from large chains to small B&B's and have never had this issue yet when I called to have the issue resolved, the response was SO WHAT! That says alot. Oh, one last thing. Prior to deciding where to stay I chacked around and found that almost every hotel in the area charges a resort fee or a parking fee which is clearly stated on their websites.

We left our phone number and went to grab lunch. Our room was overlooking the boardwalk where the Sunset Key boat docks. It also happens to be overlooking where the cruise ships dock.

I know some people have complained about the view being blocked, but when we go on vacation, we don't spend time in the room. By the time we watched the boat and got ready, we were out of the room.

Our original plans were to stay here for four nights and spend three nights in Miami but we enjoyed ourselves so much in Key West and this property that we cancelled our Miami reservations and spent an extra four days there. Upon arrival, we were upgraded from an ocean front balcony room to room 301, a very nice ocean front corner one bedroom balcony suite. On an earlier trip we had flown directly into Key West, stayed at the Hyatt suite property. We decided to burn up frequent flier miles into Miami this trip and make the drive. We probably won't do that again as the drive was alright, but nothing special and left us with a vehicle that sat in the parking garage all week the week. The valet parking is an additional expense, but necessary in Key West. The valets were a very friendly hardworking group of young men. We met a group of three young folks late one evening near the Truman annex who were living out of a older two door hatchback at a parking meter. They were young and flexible and didn't need mattresses and seemed to be having a great time. ( (Ahh, those were the days!) ) The suite was well laid out with a bedroom/smaller balcony and connecting bath/vanity area and a larger front entry room with larger living area with wet bar/fridge/dining area/large balcony and a comfortable sitting area with entertainment center/40inch hi def television and dvd player. There was another bathroom/shower connected to this room with a vanity area and large closet/robes/ironing board. The balcony is a large corner deck under a cupola roof with views to the marina and ocean front/ Mallory Square. The rocking chairs were very enjoyable on this deck. (It was extremely hot on our trip with the heat index registering over 100 degrees) Each room of the suite had a air conditioning unit controlled by thermostat and worked very well. We are from Atlanta and live with heat so we normally set our thermostats at 77/78 and are comfortable. We did hear some others complain that their rooms would not cool down to 65/66 degrees, but I question their logic at coming to the Keys if you want a ice box room. We would turn the units off when going out on the decks to enjoy the decks even more. The cruise ships docked directly in front of our room, but didn't block the entire frontage. We enjoyed seeing the ships and passengers disembark and that fueled conversations about past and future cruises. We were not bothered by their presence as we were usually gone by midmorning and the ships gone by five pm. The balcony was a great place to watch the \"cat man\" and his show and gathering during the sunset and evening. We changed to another one bedroom suite for our last three days, room 432, an interior courtyard/poolview/oceanview room without the additional bath or wetbar/dining area. There were also two balconies on this suite, but smaller than the ocean front corner suites. Jeff Alexander of the front office handled our room switch as the ocean front corner suite was reserved for a film crew making a marketing film. We enjoyed both suites and thank Jeff for how he handled this. Jane Brannigan is the concierge supervisor and performs her job very well and has a great sense of humor considering some of the utterly stupid remarks some can make. I could not do her job. The tropical storm Alex was forming behind Cuba and it's path into the Gulf was still uncertain and I listened to some really insane comments made in the concierge area as Jane helped them. (( \"Will the party cruise still go out if a hurricane comes?\" )) The pool is medium sized and open until ten pm. We enjoyed daily. The area is well kept and attended. The restaurant was alright. We ate breakfast there twice and enjoyed. Prices are reasonable for a tourist location. Speaking of prices, many have commented that this property is expensive. I felt the prices were quite in line for the area and reasonable for the quality of the rooms, services and location. It is a tourist location. The location could not be better. We walked everywhere and liked the location, but would rent bikes next trip to cover more ground. We met Diane Schmidt, the general manager of the resort and thanked her for our upgrade and the overall quality and friendliness of the staff we had met. She was very cordial and interesting to speak with. We enjoyed the Westin and will stay here again in the future and hope to plan a larger family trip later for the resort or at Sunset Key.

I had a great time and had the best location. You're far enough from the action that if you want to get away you can, but if you want it, it's only 2 minutes away! Everyone I dealt with there was super nice and friendly. Checking in was speedy and easy and the guy there answered questions I didn't even know i had. It's also very nice to have the concierge. The room was pretty nice, very big. The only weird thing was the bathroom had this sliding door that didn't seal... that can make for some awkward bathroom times. We were there for 4 days and there were cruise ships there 2 of the days. These weren't a big deal. We were in the building with the pool so they didn't even block our view or anything. All we really noticed was that it got very crowded around then. Someone who worked on one of the boats we went on said they have to be out of there by 4ish, definitely by sunset. So that shouldn't be an issue. The pool was small but I didn't have a problem getting chairs. The chairs were comfy. I thought it was weird they didn't have an ocean view from the pool like a lot of the other hotels. I didn't have a problem finding sun and a lot of the times I wanted shade. All in all we had a great trip and would do it all the same. We went on a lot of boat excursions and pretty much had to walk right out our door to get there. We were a block from Duval. There was tons of food, shopping, and activities all around. Couldn't ask for more. Oh and if you go you MUST try Latititudes. Pricy but so worth it. Maybe one of the best dinners I have ever had.

The pool area sits in the middle of 4 buildings, so it is very shaded. We weren't able to sit out much because with the wind and lack of sun it was too cold.

The views are spectacular out across the bay with the aquamarine ocean and the boats.

The front desk clerk moved us to the \"Christmas Tree Island Suite\" which appears to be one of only a few rooms that have their own name. I have no idea why they moved us to such an elegant suite, but it was a huge suite with two very large bedrooms with full baths and whirlpool, a large living room and foyer, and three balconies overlooking the ocean and the dock. The rooms were very comfortable. Also gave me the wifi code unsolicited. Unclear if this is standard or not. There is self parking or valet. Self parking was extremely convenient to our room in the SPG floor (3rd floor), as there was a bridge that led directly to the rooms. Only critiques: (1) the suite did not have any in-room safe (odd for such a luxurious set up), (2) on the first morning a fire alarm went off at about 6:00 a.m. and lasted for a few minutes. When it stopped, there was no announcement of whether it was safe to return to rooms. When I asked later what had happened, they indicated that there was construction elsewhere on the property and that dust had apparently gotten into a smoke detector that was supposed to be disabled and had not been disabled.

Our room was not in the most desirable location in the hotel - first floor, looking at the pool. I spoke to Meghan, the manager on duty. She was extremely accommodating, polite, and friendly. She moved us to what has to be one of the best rooms on the entire island the next day for the duration of our stay, and threw in two bottles of wine for our trouble (full disclosure, we're Starwood Gold level members, not sure how much that helped with the upgrade; but I'm certain that Meghan's and the staff's wonderful and helpful attitudes were completely genuine).

If I had to pay the astronomical price for the room we stayed in,I don't believe i would have been as happy because it was certainly not worth 350-400/nite. Check-in: Friendly and quick. Room: Almost completely re-furbished. Modern furniture,very contemporary feel. Regular( not flat screen) tv,with very bad reception- we didn't watch it very much anyway. No Art work in the main living area. Beautiful lamps. Bathroom area VERY nice! Nice towels and robes. Starbucks coffee and Tazo tea. When they did not replenish the tea, I called to ask for some.....they arrived within 5 mins with about 10 tea bags of 4 different varieties . A truly Heavenly bed that was sooo comfortable we had a hard time leaving it. Facilities: Pool area was very nice. Lounge chairs had thick, comfortable cushions on which I easily fell asleep....and I NEVER fall asleep poolside! Sunset deck-perfect location to view a sunset , IF you get their early enough to catch a front row seat. Bartender did not put Liquor in the drink I believe. The Strawberry Daiquiri was awful!!! The gym looked great.....about 4 treadmills and a few ellipticals. Conceirge: AWFUL!!! Now I did read some negative comments about this, but you don't realize how important this can be until you stay somewhere without a knowledgeable person It is even MORE pronounced at this Westin, since the main part of the hotel is in a different area from where you sign in. So....we finished our sunset cocktails and was looking for a restaurant to grab a bite to eat.....concierge gone by 8(remember sunset was at 7:45). I had a list of suggestions but the girl in the gift shop who sincerely tried to help gave us the wrong directions to what was apparently a very popular spot. We walked a couple of miles and finally had to settle for some sports bar someone told us about because all the other restaurants were no longer serving. But, my BIGGEST complaint was about how they tickets to Sunset Key are handled. The Westin sets aside a limited number of passes to Sunset Key daily. The girl in the gift shop said that I should be fine at 8:15, but I decided to get tot he concierge desk by 8. There was a line of about 5 people in front of me. I knew that they set aside 20 passes , so I figured I was ok. When she gets to the guy in front of me....she looked at the both of us and said ....I don't know what to do since I have only one ticket left......I guess I can extend the number by one and sell you two. Now I am staying at a 'high-end' resort and it was obvious that everyone standing on that line at 8 am was there for one reason and at no point while she is filling out forms/tickets does she give any indication that the number left was getting low. She waits until the LAST one to mention anything. I was really MOST disturbed about how they handle this situation. I called the manager(who leaves you a card each morning) and she was not in so I left a message. Never got a call back or an acknowledgement of my call. I called the manager on duty who explained that the concierge maybe thought I was making dinner reservations.....how ridiculous. No offer of a complimentary anything....something I would think an upscale hotel would do. Frankly, I was left with such a bad taste in my mouth with how this was handle and how little the hotels provides advice, etc ( you can get a nice bed anywhere) I would not recommend this hotel......we stayed at an amazing bed and breakfast the other nites.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampton, New Hampshire", "Title": "\u201cOK hotel, in a great location, at high cost\u201d", "Author": "humin32", "ReviewID": "UR59721122", "Content": "Initially stayed at the Westin Key West Resort/Marina during my first ever trip to Key West. My wife and I decided to spread the wealth and stayed at three different places during our 7 nights in Key West. The first two nights were at the Westin. Pros: The location is really ideal. The Westin is roughly a block and half to Duvall St and one block to Capt Tony's. The location is a very short walk to the most active part of Key West with regard to tourist activities. We had a sea view room with balcony. The room was very nice, I really wish timing would have worked out better to spend a sunset on that balcony with an adult beverage. Cons: Very expensive, two nights at the Westin cost more than 4 nights at a bed and breakfast. When we went to bed we had a nice ocean/harbor view room, when we woke up our view was a gone and the only thing we could see was the side of a cruise ship. The customer service was not up to what I would expect for the amount of $ I paid to stay there. My wife and I were away from the room from 9AM to 4PM, when we returned the room hadn't been made up. Housekeeping knocks on the door at ~4:30 wanting to come in, but my wife has just gotten in the shower, so I ask if they can come back, \"but we get off work at 5:00\", so I tell them to forget it. However, housekeeping did wait until we went out and made up our room after 5:00, no prompting of management required. Our luggage was delayed in arrival to Key West, not the fault of the Westin. But when it was delivered, nobody brought it up to us - I had to go down to retrieve it, which is non-trivial considering the layout of this hotel. They offered us toiletry kits on our night of arrival (toothbrush etc..) but couldn't piece together two complete sets (only one toothbrush). I would expect the front desk to have those readily available. As we later discovered this is common to Key West, but the walls allow all manner of noise to penetrate. We were woken early each morning by the activity in the marina. Considering that I paid probably twice what I would have paid for a similar star level hotel in Manhattan, the Westin Key West Resort and Marina doesn't live up to expectations. I expected to be wowed and I wasn't. BTW - I'm a Starwood member, so I've got some experience with this hotel chain.

The balcony was great because we could put the baby to bed then go out on the balcony to relax. Great views of the ocean and perfect for watching the much hyped sunset.

My mother said she has never stayed in such a nice room.. the view is the BEST!! We loved watching the cruise ships pull in and out , the sunsets, the sailboats, etc. My mother was able to walk to all the nearby museums, shops and restaurants, She even went on her own one day and took the conch train tour.. she loved it! We all felt safe alone and as a group as we explored Key West! We all 3 took the Key West Trolley tour which allows you to get off at 12 stops and get back on whenever you want. This was ideal to see the Hemingway House . We ate breakfast outside everyday at the Westin Bistro overlooking the water. The food was excellent and the service freindly. Thank you to Helen the hostess for her smiles!! We spent a little time at the pool reading and the bartender brought a platter of fresh fruit around to all the guests!! What a nice surprise...

I travel with our business to 10-12 trade shows a year,, all in resort golf areas..and I have no complaints about the Westin Key West..

If you are going to pick a room that is not a suite, I would pick room 309 as it is at the end of the hotel and has 3 balconies. It is also fairly large. The bathroom is tiny though if that is important to you. 2) Pool area - very little sunshine gets into the pool area due to the buildings. Further, it is very small and guests quickly hit the area in the am to secure their spot by throwing towels and books on the chairs Overall, the hotel just feels like it needs to be refreshed. It does not compare to other Westin hotels I have stayed at in the past. To be honest, I found myself going to a hotel on the beach called Casa Marina, which has a great lunch, drinks and view. Its a classic hotel and does not realy fall into the same category as the Westin so that comparison might be unfair.

I stay at Westin Hotels all over the world, and have come to respect and rely on their consistent quality and service. That past experience made my stay at this hotel all the more unpleasant. The location is perfect, but the good news unfortunately stops there. The rooms were plain, and poorly furnished (the TV looked like something out of the Honeymooners, there was no phone at the desk, no full length mirror, etc). The voice mail didn't work, I never received my alarm calls, and the restaurant was more like a glorified snack bar. You had to pay to use the Hotel beach, and the pool was contaminated with babies swimming in soiled diapers. I've 'traveled rough', and backpacked, and that is OK at the right time and place, it's just not the experience I expect from a Westin. I suspect the problem is that the hotel is split, and the real amenities and quality are in the sister location in Sunset Key. I know at least two guests upped and moved over there during my stay. The Key West part of the resort appears to be treated as the Cinderella, or unwanted step child, and unfortunately the amenities and service reflect this.

The room was a decent size but looking tierd.. was also disappointed that there have obviously been cutbacks, as the usual luxuries which we all appreciate seemed lacking.. ie I left my slippers in NY fully expecting them, but alas.. had to walk on the floor in flip flops at all times, knowing that this is a pet friendly hotel.. The houskeeping was of a good standard and the were always friendly... which is not the case for the receptionist at guest activities..

When I made the reservation, the only available rooms had 2 queen beds, which was fine with me, but I mentioned that it was his birthday weekend and requested to be put in a room with a King bed if one became available. The morning of our arrival, my boyfriend called the hotel to confirm everything and let them know our estimated arrival time. He also reminded them that we were celebrating his birthday and had requested to be moved into a room with a King bed if they had any available. The associate that he spoke to said that they would try to accomodate us upon arrival. When we checked in, the front desk agent did not acknowledge my boyfriend's birthday, nor did he apologize for not being able to put us in the room that we requested. What's worse, is that the desk agent next to us was helping another guest move to a room with a King bed! We were checked into a handicap room with 2 Queen beds on the first floor with a door that opened right onto the pool....how romantic. We didn't complain, because the room was big and clean and we didn't plan on spending much time in there anyway. (The room was great except for the location and the crappy old TV). After we freshened up, we went down to the pier to grab some drinks and watch the sunset at Westin's Sunset Bar. We had THE WORST COCKTAILS ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH!! and service to match it. The drinks were only $8 but they came in tiny plastic cups and we're pretty sure they didn't even contain alcohol. Its not that hard to make a mojito and a maitai...c'mon people.

I tried to stay in a cheerful mood - we were in Key West, after all, but when the room wasn't ready at 4:15 and I half playfully pointed out that the the guarantee the (very young, maybe 20 year old) concierge had used against me almost 30 minutes prior wasn't good for that much, he flipped out and said he was doing everything he could and why don't I speak to a manager, etc. I was shocked by his terrible attitude and behavior.

The amiable waitress let us use it for lunch but here's the catch - if the lunch cost $25, and the certificate is worth $40? You lose the balance. So that certificate was a joke.

My husband is a Starwood member and we used his points to stay for free two of the nights. When we arrived after a long day (flight from NJ then drove down to Key West from Ft. Lauderdale airport), we were greeted by Jeff at the front desk, who was extremely courteous and polite. We initially booked a pool view room and were upgraded to a two bedroom oceanfront suite with the most magnificent view of the sunsets every night. This hotel is perfect. The location is within walking distance to all of the attractions including Mallory Square, Duval Street, all the shops and the Conch train. On our first morning there we had a great breakfast at the hotel restaurant, but had most of our other meals in town at different locations (we like to try it all). The hotel room service was extremely well priced and the children's portions were very generous and $4 for chicken fingers was the best that I have ever seen. There is a large variety and all children's entrees were between $3-4 each (it was great). The internet service is wireless and free, yes, I said free. The parking was $20-22 a day depending on valet or not. Key West is great! Our first trip here 13 years ago (before we had children), we stayed at the Casa Marina, but wanted to stay within walking distance to town so we chose the Westin. The Westin rooms were very clean and the grounds were beautiful and very serene to walk around and look at the boats and the ocean. The only thing that I would like to note is the cruise ships. Our oceanfront suite did have a view two of our four days of the large cruise ships that dock in front of the hotel. I knew about this ahead of time so we were prepared, but these ships are very large and the view is obstructed while they are in port. The good news is that the one ship left by 2pm and the other by 5pm, so they don't ever get in the way of the sunset. The cruiseship passengers pass by the hotel on their way to and from town and some were a bit rowdy, but they got back on their ship and went to their next destination. My husband and two sons enjoyed the hotel pool. It was not extremely crowded and had nice shade from all of the surrounding palm trees. July in Key West is extremely hot and humid, so be prepared to perspire when outside, or visit in a cooler month (we'll try that next time as the heat was pretty extreme-even the Today show when filming there during our stay said the heat index is 105 with temp and humidity. Plenty of air conditioned shops, restaurants, and the hotel. While in town check out Margarittaville, Sloppy Joes and Red Fish Blue Fish restaurant. Have ice cream and watch the sunset while walking around Mallory Square. There is a fishing village with little shops that has great seafood restaurants and manatee sightings. My son loved the Ron Jon surfshop too. Parking around Ernest Hemingway's house can be a challenge to find, but is doable. There are great supermarkets like Winn Dixie and Publix, that sell bottled water and all other necessities for great prices. Great town, great shopping and dining.

We were in room 390 which is a 1 bedroom oceanfront suite in a good location overlooking the waterfront. We booked the room as a standard room and were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to the oceanfront suite. We did request that we be placed in a recently renovated room away from current renovations. The Westin is in a great location with easy walking access to almost everything you can do in Key West. It is also located at a marina which provides easy access to watersports (jet ski's, sunset cruises, parasailing, etc.). It is a block from Mallory Square and Duval Street and within easy walking distance of Historic Seaport and many of the local attractions. There is also a CVS pharmacy down the street so you can pick up some of the items you may need for your stay. Be aware that the Westin is located at the site where all of the cruise ships dock. On several morniings, we awoke to see our oceanfront view covered by massive cruise ships but they always left before the sunset arrived. There are other oceanfront rooms that would not have obscured views so you might want to request one of those. Although the Westin does not have a beach attached to it, you can pay for a daily pass (about $20 per person) to take a boat to their sister property on Sunset Key. We went over for a day but beware that the beach is very small and you are required to stay in the beach area and cannot roam the resort in this location. Overall, I would recommend going to Fort Zachary Taylor Park which has a public beach and more public activities to do. They do have a decent fitness center located right off the pool deck. The pool at the Westin was a salt water pool (either that or it had a lot of salt in it) and is relatively small compared to the number of people using it. We were able to locate chairs when we went to the pool area. Adjacent to the pool is a second story bar area which is a great location to enjoy a cocktail while watching the beautiful sunsets. We did eat at the hotel restaurant and the food was really good and reasonably priced (at least as compared to all of the restaurants in Key West). I do understand why some reviews indicate that the hotel is a bit tired and run down in some areas but it is clear that they are in the process of updating it.

In fact, I just got back from a one night stay at my usual Westin Copley in Boston, and I can't believe it's the same organization as the Key West Westin. The first room we were taken to was a first floor room with a patio on a public walkway. Yikes....there were people walking 8 feet from our door. For $459 per night, we asked to be moved off the ground floor. The only other room we were told was available turned out to be shabby and not very clean. The ottoman was obviously stained, the television had drip marks down its face, and the carpet was dirty. The balcony in this second room was too small to sit on and the furniture on it was dirty, and a huge bush blocked most of the view. The worst part was the fact that the lavatory (sink) was outside the tiny commode/shower room, and the sliding glass door that separated the commode/shower room from the rest of the room would not stay on its track and was thin and did not close. Neither of us could shower, use the commode or even wash our hands without sharing the experience with the other. It was like sleeping in the same room as your toilet. The power went out shortly after we arrived, plunging the tiny room into darkness, but I don't think that the hotel was responsible for this. It didn't help our memory of the experience, 'though. There was Westin soap, Westin towels, etc., but nothing else seemed like a Westin. We checked out early the next morning -- our vacation time is too short to spend it in a room where the beds might as well be next to the toilet. I politely explained our issues to the front desk clerk, who politely explained to me that they'd have to nick me an additional $100 for the early checkout. I didn't care at that point and just wanted to be out of there. We relocated to the Ritz Carlton in Naples to finish the rest of our vacation, where for only $50 more per night, we had a room with a separate bathroom, spotlessly clean accommodations, etc. When we turned in our keys at the Westin, we waited in line behind two other unhappy, complaining customers.

The buildout and service are great with marble and all that but the layout is Hilton with a small bathroom, one sink and you wonder if that the structural concrete with the cracks in the ceiling is coming down anytime soon. If you don't run the AC all the time the noise from the infrastructure or the drunks coming past your room until 2:30AM screaming \"bleep you\" at their spouse (probably too common in Key West so maybe not a fault here) will drive you nuts.

Inside northeast (elevators on the west side), outside southwest or outside northwest appeared to be the best rooms for the lower rates.

The convenience makes for a much more enjoyable Key West experience. The facilities are above-average. The pool is cramped and didn't really make us want to hang out there. The workout room is also a bit on the smallish side. There are some decent shops that are also a part of the hotel. The rooms are comfortable and spacious enough. If you've never stayed at a Westin, the Heavenly Beds do live up to your expectations. My wife and I slept incredibly well every night (though perhaps all of the Duval Street drinks influenced that...). Our only real complaint about the room was the lack of a DVD player. Oh, and we were confronted with a huge cockroach on the wall one afternoon, but after getting rid of it we had no other bug issues. One other note on the rooms - they are very quiet and it seems like the hotel has solid insulation from noise. Our friends would knock on the wall of the adjoining room and we could barely hear it. Excellent if you're next to a family with screaming kids. Bistro 245 serves up some really good breakfast and lunch - I'd recommend grabbing a bite there during your stay since it's so convenient. I would not recommend getting drinks at the Sunset Deck, though. Sure, the view of sunset is hard to beat but the bartenders are slower than death. We had four people spread out across the bar trying to get a drink at one point and they wouldn't even look at us. The staff overall was friendly and helpful - no complaints there. We made all of our own plans so we never utilized the services of the concierge desk. We attempted to take advantage of the access to the private beach at Sunset Key but it was sold out by the time we tried to book it. We heard that it was the best beach in Key West so I'd recommend calling early to book a cabana there.

We asked to be moved to a room with a bathtub, and were placed in one of the unremodeled rooms. This room was on a wing with active construction, and when we arrived back at the hotel around noon, we were greeted with the sound of jackhammers. (You know that commercial where the guy is trying to talk to his wife over the jackhammers -- yeah, like that). Obviously, this wasn't acceptable, so we went back to the front desk and asked to be moved a second time away from the construction. The manager's response to our request was -- \"Didn't you check the website, we've posted that the hotel is undergoing construction.\" After explaining to him that freedom from jackhammer noise from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. was not actually a luxury, but pretty basic to a hotel experience, whether or not it was noted on the website, we were moved once again. No bathtub but better than jackhammers. The next room was fine. The beds were very comfortable and the support staff (housekeeping, bellmen, etc.) were friendly and helpful. There is a ceiling fan in the room which was nice. The rooms have Starbucks coffee makers which make a cup at a time and unlike most hotel coffee makers, the coffee is very good. We asked for and were provided a refrigerator in our room at no charge. The televisions are old and reception is poor. There was a lot of static on ALL of the televisions in all three rooms. There is no real desk in the room, only a small table. The rooms have balconies with a table and two chairs. The marina shopping area isn't extensive and is very expensive. Also, cruise boats dock there so the view is blocked for days at a time. \"Ocean-view\" rooms, therefore, are sometimes ocean view and sometimes not. The location is excellent, most attractions and restaurants are within walking distance which is a plus because driving in Key West is a white-knuckle experience. Scooters, bicycles and pedestrians dart out in front of cars without regard to stoplights. The streets are narrow and there is little parking.

We took the long drive from Orlando to Key West in just over 7 hours only to arrive very tired and hot at the Westin front desk to find out our cottage was not ready and we would be staying at the main resort. Disappointed was an understatement, I had booked this cottage on Sunset Key 6 months previously and was in no mood to NOT get the room I reserved. However, I have learned from previous stays at Westin properties, Westin knows how to recover so very well in this type of situation. To make things right, they arranged for us to stay in one of their largest and most luxurious suites in the main hotel, two bedrooms, two baths, four balconies, dinning room and a massive foyer. Plus chilled champage and chocolate covered strawberries. Next morning our cottage was ready at the crack of dawn and we were in our wonderful cottage before noon. After a rocky start, and great recovery by the management at the Westin, after a short 5 minute boat ride to Sunset Key we were greeted by the Westin concierge at the dock. He showed us the most beautiful grounds, beach, pool, dining and of course our cottage. The cottage is nothing short of gorgeous, extremely large bedrooms, THREE full bathrooms all with huge showers. Beds were the most comfortable I have ever experienced at any hotel, I looked forward to them each and every night. The decor was truly beach like, blues and yellows thoughout, nautical touches everywhere and siding on the inside walls of the living area, a very neat touch that made us feel like we were in beach house. Fans in each room kept things nice and cool, windows everywhere which made this a very bright space. Concierge was extraordinary, she (Bridget) was most pleasant and helpful the entire stay, thank you so much. Each morning they leave you with a basket of fresh baked muffins, breads and danish slices, plus oranges and bananas and USA Today. We make the mistake of buying other breakfast stuff which was a huge mistake, the breakfast basket is MORE than enough for the 4 of us. The sand and beach and water were excellent. They have two beach attendants who spent most of their time in the shade NOT helping us. Only when you asked for help, would they help, they never brought towels or chair pads voluntarily. I think their lack of help was due to the fact that we did not purchase mass quantities of drinks from them. The crew on the boat launch was great, always friendly always great to give you tips on what to do and where to eat. Speaking of eating, we ate at the Rooftop Cafe in Key West, which was excellent, highly recommended. In summary, my spouse and I, who have travelled extensively, cruised, all inclusives, hotels, rental houses, etc, etc, would say this was the best vacation ever. It was FAR from cheap, in fact it was expensive BUT everything was so beautiful and wonderful it was worth the expense and we would do the Westin Sunset Key again. If you don't have the money, you should borrow the money to stay at Sunset Key.

We booked an ocean front room and reading the other reviews about the cruise ships right outside your window made us question whether we wanted to pay the extra for ocean view room. We took our chances and our oceanfront room was very nice and comfortable. Out of 3 nights there, Thurs., Fri. and Sat. nights we only woke to a cruise ship Friday morning. When asked about it, they didn't expect another until Tuesday morning. I was disappointed though because I thought ocean front meant beach front. No beach at this property. Our ocean front room was over the ocean deck where beautiful boats were parked with little shops under our balcony. The cruise ship wasn't on top of us, like I thought it might be from the other reviews, but it did take away the ocean view from 7 a.m. until early afternoon. I like ocean front rooms for the view, which was beautiful there especially at sunset, the beach which wasn't there, the sound of the ocean at night when I open the doors or windows - I couldn't do that here with the shops under us and people roaming the deck. We didn't sit out on the balcony like I thought we would either because of the people being right there. For the $60.00 extra per night, it wasn't really worth ocean front. The pool area looked pretty and the rooms with balconies over that looked nice. For $60.00 less I would go with that view next time. But this hotel is expensive. Still, that is what you have to pay for a very nice place in Key West, I guess. Housekeeping was fine. We had no problem with the cleanliness of the room, but they were really loud while they cleaned the room next door to us mid afternoon when we went back for a little siesta because of the very high heat outside. Housekeeping put that bar across the door to keep the door ajar and they kept going in and out, in and out with the door banging shut loudly at least 10 times in a row! What on earth!?! Were they taking in one towel at a time or something? Why so many extremely loud bangs of that door? At least it wasn't in the middle of the night. That was our only problem with the hotel, except for concierge. A snooty lady was no help there, not friendly at all, but it was probably just that one bad person. A smile, dear. You are a reflection of the hotel after all. Red Fish Blue Fish is a great relaxing bar and grill to walk to for a good shrimp po boy or grouper or dolphin sandwich. The sunset celebration is right there. The Sea Rocket at sunset was a fast fun boat ride and the driver was fun, too. You don't get wet and you just wear whatever you have on. Really fun! The Conch Tour trollley was really good if you want to get on and off at different spots all day, which I highly recommend over the Conch Tour Train, which was excellent for just a tour of the city, with maybe 2 stops vrs. 10 or 11 on the trolley. Both had great drivers who gave wonderful narrations of the city. The Trolley went all thru Key West while the train did not go to the older part of town. Don't go to Key West in the hot summer months unless you want to rest in your room or in the pool during the afternoon hours. It is so so hot!!!! Winter is better. We'll never go in the heat of summer again, but we are over 50, so maybe you younger people can take the heat better. Very hot!!! Overall we had a great time! Lots of walking, of course.

One overlooked the parking garage, one was small with the noise of the A/C unit, but the other was on the corner, ocean view, and was perfect, with two rocking chairs and a small table. The room was large but the bathroom was small. I am pretty sure this room has not been refurbished yet, but was still in pretty good shape. The pool is small and the pool bar very plain, but the food from the bar was fantastic! We had one of our most memorable meals at the pool! I had the Grouper Sandwich and my wife had the Veggie Wrap. Both were outstanding! Since it was the middle of June and neither my wife nor I are \"sun worshipers\", we enjoyed lounging at the pool, in the shade - I just wish there was more of it! Only about a dozen lounge chairs that stayed shady most of the afternoon and they were prime commodities. The location is perfect for Key West. Only a block over from \"Lower Duval St.\" and all of the activity. No need for a car. But the bikes we rented were helpful. We will return to Key West and this hotel.

I figured I would just post my response to them here. An additional note, the hotel is undergoing construction through October. This hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The hotel was not westin caliber. It was a cheap hotel with a westin name stuck on the front door. The hotel was undergoing MAJOR CONSTRUCTION. As a guest on vacation I want to relax. this was not possible. First, I was not told about the construction until less than 2 weeks before my arrival - this is unacceptable. This should have been on the website and guests should be told of this when booking. When I received the email from the westin about the construction, I emailed the hotel to tell them that I was very unhappy and that I want to be sure that my stay was not affected by the construction - I DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. I then called the hotel and spoke with someone who told me that my stay would not be affected and that it was \"just a few rooms\" that they were renovating. I specifically requested to be kept away from the renovation. I was told that she could \"put a note in my file\". When we arrived we were upgraded to an oceanview room - this should have been the first warning for us. We stayed on the second floor of the building adjacent to the lobby. We were one of 3 rooms on the floor that were not undergoing MASSIVE CONSTRUCTION!! There were holes in the hallway walls, construction workers all over the halls, crumbled drywall everywhere (in the carpets, stairs, elevators), the smell of paint from the rooms, tarps, stain, DRILLING, POUNDING, HAMMERING, SAWING all day!!! It was absolutely appalling. The rooms was dirty and old - rug was stained, wall paper was peeling off of the walls in the bathroom, rust on all of the hinges and faucets, dirty bed skirt, slider didn't open well, etc. The bathroom was so small you could barely get in - you had to go behind the door in order to shut the door - same with the balcony (2ft by 3??). Cruise ships pull up every day in front of the \"ocean view\" - which by the way is a harbor view not an ocean view. There was no pool service (get you own towels, drinks, food, etc). The pool bar was atrocious - I considered taking a picture of it to put on trip advisor because it was so bad - it looked like a bar that someone set up in the corner of their backyard deck -bar stools from the 70s, rusty paper towel rack on the wall, box fan blowing, and $11 drinks! I don't mind paying $11 for a drink, but 1) it was 6 ounces and 2) it was in a dump. One night we came back late and asked the front desk if there was a vending machine that we could get bottled water from. We were told no and that we should use the minibar. I told the night manager that I did not want to use the minibar and that I found it hard to believe that a hotel of this size did not have a vending machine. I was told it didn't. We drank the $5 waters from the minibar and then found the vending machine in our building (2 floors up) the next day. Had we not had been using Starpoints to stay 2 nights for free, I would have checked out immediately. We did pay for the first night $422.00, which was the biggest rip off ever. To stay in a place, not undergoing renovation, but undergoing construction!! during our stay was unacceptable. Even the hotel staff commented to us when we complained that they thought that the building we were staying in should have been closed during construction because it was such a mess. This was by far not only my worst Westin stay, but my worst hotel stay ever. To call this a Westin (and a resort!!) is deceitful. By the way, we stayed at the Marquesa Hotel during the first half of our trip and it was wonderful.

My husband and I and another couple were the only 4 people on the beach. What a great day, and then we topped it off with a sunset dinner cruise (see my review under Key West sunset dinner cruise). The hotel pool is nice, but it was too warm to go into. We did hang out there though. The sunset bar on the second level is also fun - to watch everyone down on Mallory Square and the great sunsets.

The property layout is ridiculous. There are two buildings spread out across public areas of the Key West marina (think hundreds of college students walking around drinking beers and street performers). There was only one restaurant (which was very poor). A very small hotel pool (which was equally poor). If you have every stayed in a great beach resort, think of the things that made your stay great (beautiful rooms, great food, friendly staff, amazing pool, near the beach etc.. etc...).

We stayed at the Hyatt first, which was a spectacular boutique hotel (the walk in shower at the Hyatt was larger than our entire bathroom at the Westin). However, while quirky and older, the Westin had some pluses. There are two buildings at the Westin, the Marina Building (which has the front desk) and the Main Building, which has the pool and restaurants. We stayed in the Main Building on the second floor. About a third of the second floor was being renovated during our stay. There was some noise during the day but it was not overly intrusive. I did see inside one of the rooms being renovated and it was totally gutted. The rooms will still be small, but I expect they will be modernized. The cruise ships that others mention tend to park in front of the Marina Building, rather than the Main Building, but due to configuration, there would be minimal direct Gulf view rooms in the Main Building. Our room had obviously not been renovated and it was dated and dinged. The view from our room was horrible as was the noise was unbearable on the patio from the AC system outside. However, we had a great deal on the room and did not complain (kinda expected one worst rooms based upon our price). The beds as usual were comfy and inside the room it was quiet enough. Maid service was inconsistent at best. We broke a glass on the patio and left a note for the maid to clean it up. Not sure if there was a language barrier or not, but she ignored the note and left the broken glass on the patio. Additionally, the same day our toiletries were not restocked and all of out towels were not replaced. The pool was nice, clean, and relatively quiet, mostly adults but a few families. Some of the families were more courteous to the other guests than some others who let their kids run wild despite having the only kids at the pool (not sure why anyone would bring younger kids to Key West in the first place but that is another issue). They came around occasionally with fresh fruit at the pool, which was a nice touch. The food and beverage at the Westin was excellent. I can honestly say that I had my best meal in Key West at the pool bar for lunch (a fish sandwich), and we went to some relatively expensive meals at well regarded restaurants. Additionally, the bar service was very good at every bar and every time of day. Dale at the pool bar was a master of the mojito.

We had booked online at spg.com for Starwoods Preferred Guests and had booked an Oceanfront Room and specified, \"true Oceanfront Room with high floor\" On arrival we received a fairly friendly welcome, once we arrived at room we ventured out onto a puny balcony for our \"Oceanfront \"view of a marina and view of a large berthed Yacht and an even larger Cruise ship, no Ocean View and definitely not Ocean \"Front\". A quick trip back to the front desk, resulted in being offered an alternative room, that was truly oceanfront, Suite 163, that while on the ground floor, provided a superb Oceanfront View, twin rocking chairs on a large patio and a great vantage point for the daily \"Sunset Celebration\". The pool area and pool are quite compressed, but we never had difficulty in finding chairs to hang out there. We had breakfast twice and dinner once at the Oceanfront Bistro 245, and both the food and service were very good. We took advantage of the Sunset Key Island on three occasions across the Harbour and accessible by launch. This is an excellent guest feature that you should check out and is well worth the $20 per person fee. Although the description of the fee as being \"nominal\" (dictionary defined as: \"being trifling in comparison with the actual value\") is not really accurate. Twenty bucks is a lot of dough and I encountered several guests at the concierge desk who were \"sticker shocked\" at the fee. Get to concierge desk before the 8:00 opening. I discovered showing up at 9:00 that they had already sold out the beach passes that are apparently capped at 40 per day. Even then you should take the first boat out to the beach at 9:15, as after that time the lone beach attendant is scrambling to secure chairs for everyone. We had both lunch and dinner at the Latitudes restaurant at the Sunset Key Island, which featured outstanding food and service, and an unbelievable setting. You must check this place out. The overall staff experience was top-notch, very friendly, courteous quite attentive and responsive. The only exception was a very negative experience when we made an inquiry at the front desk of the Sunset Key Island adjacent to the Latitudes Restaurant on last Wednesday after lunch. Given that we were essentially paying a daily $40 premium to visit the Beach there, we were curious on the price differential between an Oceanfront Room at the Westin and a One Bedroom cottage at the Sunset Key, if it was minor we would've upgraded and stayed there for the balance of our stay. The receptionist there, dismissively babbled out the Westin website address and suggested that we check out room rate availability and pricing there online and advised that she did not have any pricing information as they were in the process of changing the rates. None of this response rung true it appeared that we were getting the \"not subtle at all\" brush off by this brusque individual. When I advised that I was well aware off the website and we had booked our reservation there initially, and I was quite serious in my inquiry. She responded that if I we were \"really, really, really, serious\" that she would look into this. Finally, she quickly advised that there was no room availability on the Friday in any event. Her unpleasant treatment was the only exception to otherwise excellent customer service that we had encountered. This particular employee is better suited to a back of the house role, versus front of the house role -- one far removed from direct guest interactions. My other observation would be on the housekeeping, that I would describe as a cursory \"once over\" only versus a thorough room cleaning process. Also, our room was near a staff lunchroom and we had to, on more than one occasion, run a gauntlet of staffers hanging out in the hallway adjacent to it, and once immediately directly in the alcove in front of our door blocking access to our room. While obviously staff need to have their lunch and rest area, management should advise and attune the staff on the poor guest optics of congregating and loitering in spaces adjacent to guest rooms. We also once encountered a staff person having a post lunch siesta in the shade of a palm tree immediately adjacent to our room patio. Advice: Be insistent on getting a true Oceanfront room at the time of check in. Management's definition of this and a reasonable guest's expectation vary greatly. During our short stay I overheard numerous guests complaining about this fact. Westin should differentiate between an Oceanfront and a OceanView/Marina View and price accordingly. Their current pricing practice is quite dubious at best.

We really enjoyed our stay despite record-breaking cold weather (hey, it beat shoveling the record-breaking snow back home!). I'm a hospitality consultant who breaks everything down to particulars so here are my thoughts/observations: Service - I experienced nothing but very good to excellent service throughout the hotel. The front desk people upgraded us from two requested adjoining rooms to a 2BR suite (K/QQ/Living area with three dormer balconies as described in another recent review). Because of the weather we ended up spending more time in the room than usual and the extra space made a big difference. Every trip to the front desk was quick, friendly, and efficient. Top notch attitude, even when they were slammed at check in/check out. A+! Housekeeping was friendly and accommodating to our changing requests on when to service our room. The turn down staff caught on and started leaving all the chocolates in the kids' room. Room servers were great and all of our orders were timely and correct, same with poolside servers. Pool staff always had clean towels and picked up the ones left by guests. Restaurants- Here is a really great thing about this Westin: they have an awesome kids menu( the Kids Club menu). Real food like french toast, salmon filet, and creative kids desserts and I don't think one item is over $4. Hands down the cheapest and best food for the kids we found on the island. I could feed my kids, including dessert, delivered to the room for less than $20 including tip. The same menu is available at Bistro. That's a deal! We ate at Bistro 245 twice. Our meals were very good and one was excellent. We were happy with everything. Our food was slowed a little (we ate during sunset rush) but our server was great. We had drinks at the Sunset Deck and down by the pool. Whatever that green slushy drink is, it's tasty and goes down quickly and is made even better with an extra shot on top. ; ) Bartenders were attentive. Property - This location can't be beat, even with the cruise ships docked. Central to everything, walking distance to everything (maybe not Smathers Beach). Because of the weather we didn't get over to Sunset Key beach, but we took a boat around the island and it looks fabulous. Overall I thought the property looked very good. The landscaping is beautiful throughout the hotel. There are some minor maintenance needs, but the common and public areas were clean and attended to. Poolside chaises were thickly padded, clean and really comfortable. The Sunset Deck seating could be updated but it was not damaged or in disrepair that we saw. The lobby looks great. They serve orange juice through most of the morning...nice local touch. The business center was small but just what you need: internet, MSOffice, printer. The free wireless internet service in our room worked great, I never got dropped even when moving from room to room or onto the balconies. The hallways were in good shape. It looked like newer carpet, at least on the 4th floor (SPG floor). I really liked the balconies off the elevator lobbies, how nice to have sunshine and open air in the hallway. Our rooms were really nice. The bathrooms were updated - bowed shower curtain, premium Heavenly Bath accouterments - but I would have liked more counter space. Ah, those Heavenly Beds! I love love love love them and wish all hotels had them! Starwood absolutely wins the bed wars with those sweet things. There were desks in each bedroom, both of which had some of the finished chipped off. There was a Hemmingway-esque, weathered look to it but I'm not convinced that is intentional. There were no dressers. Drawers were in the nightstands (2 in the K room, 1 in the QQ room) and there were shelves in the TV armoire. KW is an almost entirely casual place, so I'd think more guests would use drawers than the closet. We had room for all of our stuff, but it seemed kind of awkward. This was bad -- the upholstered furniture must be replaced. The couch in the living room was so stained and torn I can't believe it was in there. I would have complained had I been paying the $1000+/nightly internet rate. The chair and ottoman in the QQ room was also worn and stained. The one aspect of our stay that truly disappointed me is that this Westin advertises that is has \"scheduled and supervised children's activities\" and it doesn't (not even during peak season). We love Kids Club! It's a huge thing for us, given our kids' ages, and a primary reason we chose this property over another. They list it on both their corporate and rogue websites, and in three places in their in-room amenities book. The reason two staff people gave is that this property isn't really a \"resort\" hotel. Considering the physical layout and public accessibility of the property, I kind of understand that. But then they should not list resort amenities like Kids Club in their advertising or call it a resort. That is completely misleading. Setting that \"resort\" expectation is probably the root cause of disappointment noted by some of this Westin's guests. As a hotel, I think this is a great place and Westin quality. But I expect something extra from a Westin resort, and this hotel falls short of my usual exceptional Westin resort experience. Despite my disappointment we all had a great time and loved the hotel. We'd return to KW and choose this hotel again. Service was fabulous and that's very important to me. The location just can't be beat.

It wasn't our first choice but Island City House was booked. This hotel was a very nice place and a wonderful location. We used the hotel website to book the room(s) and I guess due to the holiday it was extremely expensive for a 2 bedroom suite. The suite was called the Simonton Suite and it overlooked the pool on the 4th floor. We had 3 balconies so that was really nice. The balconies are big and have a table/chairs on them. We were supposed to have \"Ocean View\" which is really \"Pool View\" which is \"Ocean Liner View\" if you look to the left ...you often can't see the ocean due to the cruise ship parking. The room consisted of a vestibule and then a door to a very large sitting area (with pull out sofabed), tv, refrigerator and minibar. That room was in the center of the two bedrooms - each could be reached via the vestibule or the living room; one room had a king bed and one room had 2 queen beds - both had a full bath. The beds are \"heavenly\" as is the shower but the bathrooms are not very luxurious at all. Overall, the room was very large and comfortable but not really Westin-posh and since it was like essentially 2 rooms in one, the price was more than you (or I!) want to know. We got room service quite a few times as we were there for 4 days, and given that the hotel is sort of spaced out along the waterfront, the poor servers are unable to use carts and must carry all the trays. This led to them forgetting a lot of things - probably because it is so much to carry. Room service prices, fare, and quality were just typical. I am not sure what to suggest as for your room requests because it was difficult to ascertain which rooms would have a good view due to the configuration of the hotel. The lobby and ballrooms are in another building entirely, for example. I did not see the fitness center. The business center is fine. There is free wireless internet in the room. The proximity to Duval Street and to the Mallory Square sunset festival cannot be beat. The valet parking was high priced and we drove from Fort Lauderdale but never used the car again , so think about one-way car rentals if you drive, or renting scooters if you fly. They did have a complimentary stroller for our young child so that was very nice. Ask at the front desk if you need. The pool was nice but it was hard to get a seat by it. Many people had taken to running out early in the morning and putting their items upon chairs to \"reserve\" them as it fills up quickly and very fully. The pool is on the small-ish side and the hot tub is \"just ok\" (and not really very hot). Poolside bar service is a nice touch however! We tried to buy the (expensive) passes to the beach which is a Westin private island offshore (reached by their boat) but were unable to get any. Apparently they start selling them at 8 a.m. (I wonder how many people woke up on New Years' Day for that?!) but even getting in line for the passes at 7:30 as we did one day does not mean you will get a pass...the consierge said there were only 40 slots available. Overall, it is, as others have stated here, not up to Westin standards (yet?) but a good , albeit quite overpriced, hotel in an awesome location. You will probably have a fine stay if you read the reviews here, follow the tips and know what you are getting into ahead of time.

I would suggest a room that was on the side of the hotel (not oceanfront), since there are cruise ships docked almost every day. This way you get a partial ocean view. The rooms are not huge, but the rooms are very nice with a balcony and I loved the heavenly bed for sleeping. The location is perfect.

Mostly, I am always suspect of the reviews where someone is clearly out get retribution for not being given a complimentary room for bad room service, or something that always seems insignificant to me. This review simply to point out this hotels shortfalls and what I believe to be misleading representation of itself. Also, before going further, I want to point out that I am in the hospitality industry, mostly through the financing of hotels and the disposition of them. I have worked for a hotel investment-banking firm now for six years and predominantly deal with Starwood (Westin is part of the Starwood Hotel Group), Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt, and IHG flagged hotels. We have a North American office and a new office in London, that covers much of Western Europe. I share this in an effort to qualify my remarks regarding the Westin Key West. I know much of what the franchises expect from their flags/hotels. I booked a suite at this hotel from March 22nd-25th, for weekend fishing trip with two friends from home. Hotel accommodations were important to us, but not the most important for this trip, as we would be spending a great deal of time on the boat fishing during the day. However, a nice, clean and comfortable room was something we all agreed would be nice. So, when I saw the Westin on expedia.com, I thought it would be perfect fit, albeit the $625/night cost of room, which I assumed was due to spring break rate increases throughout the island. Plus, Westin has done a great job keeping the brand up to date and creating a hip feel to their hotels. We arrived and immediately were blown away by the fantastic location! Without question, this hotel is wonderfully located in the heart of Old Town Key West. You do have cruise ships that park in front of the hotel during the day, but they are gone before the sunset celebration, which is a lovely experince. We were fishing all day, so the cruise ships did not bother us at all. What was frustrating to my group, was the fact that this hotel was originally a Hilton Hotel and looks/feels like a Holiday Inn. Apparently the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u0153converted\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to a Westin recently, but other than the name being changed there is no difference. I admit they have upgrade to the standard Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Shower, which are Westin requirements, but that is it! The carperts looked as though they may have been from when the hotel was originally built. The TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were from the 1950\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and BOTH of our controllers did not work. Our bathrooms were modeled from a Days Inn Interstate motel. They were old vermica countertops with a slab of reflective glass as a mirror. The tile was filthy were the grout was originally laid (something a PIP will kill this hotel on). The elevators were paneled with multi-color confetti paneling and slow. The staff(at least in the lobby)were all dressed in their personal shirts that ranged in type, but all had on Westin name tags. On Saturday, we had lunch at the bar upstairs, overlooking the water. We ordered fish dip for the 3 of us to share, each a salad and an entr\u00c3\u00a9e. The whole order was brough at one time, where we pointed out that we no longer wanted the appetizer then. At that time the server stated, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we should have told him that we wanted the dip first.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd What??? The fish dip was offered under \u00e2\u20ac\u0153appetizers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd! In any case, the dip was aweful, our salads were warm and my grouper sandwich was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or raw. I also need to mention that the NCAA bball tournament was on TV, but we were unable to watch because they have two TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s facing one another that are positioned for the bartender only (minor detail, but worth pointing out)?!?!? On Sunday we went to have brunch at the hotels caf\u00c3\u00a9, wich I must say is a decorative nighmare for a Westin hotel. We asked to order off the menu as opposed to the buffet that was spread throughout the room with no rhyme or reason. We sat for 15-minutes before being asked what we would like to drink. No joke, we actually timed this as we figured something would go wrong. After laughing at the time this was taking we got up and left the hotel for another place to eat. I became aware that this hotel was originally a Hilton when I noticed, by the pool a sign that had Westin on it with tape. Upon another look you can see the word Hilton below the tape. After noticing this once, I noticed it several more times throughout the hotel, none more apparent than one of my towels having a Hilton Hotels label on it! So after rambling on here, let me make it clear that I understand things happen, but charging me over $600/night for Holiday Inn product and service is ridiculous. To anyone that is used to Westin standards, you know why we chose this hotel. Westin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s are traditionally wonderful hotels and worth the rate. This however was the most horrible Westin I have ever, seen, much less visited. I should also mention that I did not make my gripes apparent to the hotel management, as I am one who believes you get what you sign up for and complaining does no good. It is unfortunate though that this hotel advertises as a Westin when it is not even in a Sheraton by Four Points league! Great location, horrible hotel. I have stayed at the Casa Marina in Key West before, and for a comperable price, it blows the Westin out of the water. FYI...I walked into the Pier House just to see the hotel and their rooms are the same as the Westin's for $300/night less!!! By the way...we caught 7 sailfish with Capt.

Every evening we celebrated sunset from our balcony with mango mojitos in hand, and watched the wonderful circus of performers and revelers unfold before our eyes. The location is exceptional. The Westin provided us with a little haven of cleanliness and relaxation just a few hundred yards from the booze -fueled frenzy of Duval Street; a pleasant balance for our vacation. What no one told us on Trip Advisor is that the Westin has a private island with homes and rentals called Sunset Key. For a small fee, you can purchase tickets from the concierge and board a short ferry ride to Sunset and spend your day enjoying the finest beach on Key West, exceptional chair-side service, and wonderful food at the restaurant. You can't explore the island because it is private, but our mellow day on the beach (more mojitos) was one of the highlights of our trip. As for the cruise ships parked outside? Besides the inevitable surge of annoying curisers they expelled, what's the big deal? We thought they were interesting, and they never stayed around long enough to interfere with sunset views. The pool? Sure, it's small and rather enclosed, but given the location of the hotel they've made the best of the space and we enjoyed it (more mojitos).

On our first night, ESPN had a boxing event in the square which generated a lot of crowd noise. This hotel has recently been taken over from Hilton by Westin and is in need of refurbishment. Our bedroom was ok but the lounge area needed a complete overhaul.(carpets badly stained etc). Westin operates as a non smoking hotel, but our room must have been a smoking room in the past. This was very unpleasant for my wife who suffers from asthma and within a short time needed to take her inhaler. We contacted the front desk, but rather than move us, they got housekeeping to put an ioniser into the room. This only masked the problem, but we decided to put up with the room as we loved the location. My advice to Westin would be to refurbish the former \"smoking rooms\" first, as you cannot remove the smell of smoke that is embedded in carpets and walls. Plus points of the hotel were the staff, who were very friendly, the bed which truly was 'heavenly', a fridge in the room and the nighty turndown service with a bottle of water and chocolate was lovely.

The Westin's most redeeming factor: the location was very nice (not too close to Duval but within a quick walk to most restaurants) However, we were specifically told we would have an ocean view, but a huge private charter boat was right in front of our second floor patio the entire time. I mean, when I went out on our deck in the morning to sit back with a cup of coffee, there were people on the boat that were able to look directly into our room. I never wanted to open the drapes! The first night I asked the concierge how long the boat was scheduled to be there, and her response was \"we don't have that information, but they don't usually stay longer than a day or two\". Well, I was told by several business owners that information is public knowledge and posted on several local websites. The Westin never offered to move us so there we stayed. I was told later by someone on the return flight home that the same thing happened to them at the Westin, and they had some of their $$ reimbursed. I guess I didn't talk to the right people. Moving on, the walls in the hotel hallways and in the room needed a coat of paint - they were dirty and \"marked on\". And the housekeeping staff could have done a better job cleaning the bathroom (and this is coming from someone who is not a clean freak). The Westin did post a notice saying they would only clean the bed linens every third day, in order to conserve water, energy etc. I have no problem with that, but other people might. In walking around Key West for the first time, there seemed to be other places that looked appealing for half the $$.

The roof top bar gave us a great view of the sunset and then a short walk to Duval street for a night of fun. The Sunday brunch was expensive, but the selection they had made it worth it and the added bonus of getting to watch a cruise ship dock really added to the experience. If you are looking to take a jet ski tour around the island, try to find another location. Our tour was fun and fast but we did not get to go into the little hidden spots I was expecting. Our tour guide was somewhat knowledgeable when we stopped for a break but I was more interested in going fast on the ski. I know this review is about the hotel but for drinks, anywhere you go is great. Live music in every establishment, but if you need a break from the heat Irish Kevin's is the place to go for AC and good music. After cooling off Sloppy Joe, Dogs Breathe, Whistle, Bull and Captian Tony's are all good bars. For food The Counch Republic on the water was great not only for food but also for thier bar. The hidden jems of the vacation is Pepe's for dinner, make sure you sit outside under the trees, great ambiance. And if you like buffalo wings, I know we are in Key west but PT's bar right down from Pepe's are the best I have ever eaten. Nice locals joint but that is half the fun of going on vacation.

We had a wonderful time there. The hotel was very nice, and the staff were extremely helpful. Right from the start the Front Desk and Bell staff were very helpful and courteous. We did not find a single person in the hotel that did not want to go out of their way to help out with anything we needed. We were given a partial ocean view room that looked over the marina. The room was clean, and neat, but a little on the small side. That was not a big issue since you don't spend much time in your room anyway in Key West. We called housekeeping a few times for extra towels etc.. and they were right there within (5) minutes each time. This was a holiday weekend, and we still received excellent prompt service! I was a bit disappointed in the \"crib\" that was brought to the room. It was a well worn \"Pack-n-Play\". Our son still slept fairly sound in it, but I had expected a \"real\" crib. You can not beat the location of this hotel. It is right in the middle of the action in Old Town. The only other large hotels that have this convenience would be the Hyatt or the Pier House. The hotel is right on Mallory Square where they have the most beautiful sunsets and events every night. I mention to be warned if you have an ocean view room, you may have a cruise ship parked in front of your view for a day or two. This did not effect us, but I know it really bothers some people who pay extra for that ocean view. The pool area is very nice as well. You need to get there early if you want a seat, they are limited. We went to the pool after lunch, and could not find a chair anyplace. Fortunately someone saw us with our infant looking around for a seat, felt bad for us, and gave their seat to us so that we had a place to put the baby down. There are so many places to eat. We ate a Kelly's, which was superb, and has a great courtyard under the trees. We also ate at Big Daddy Conch's. It was not much to look at from the outside or in, but the food was very good. We ate the Sunday Brunch at the Hilton and also found that to be excellent. It was very $$ at $80 for two, but the selection was out of this world, and worth it (huge raw bar, crab legs, shrimp, breakfast foods, prime rib, sushi, etc...

I can see how some people who stay there complain about their rooms facing the bar or pool area, but the hotel in general was excellent. Our room was in the main building overlooking the marina and the docked cruise ships. If you are looking for privacy, then this is not the hotel for you. There are plenty of other \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Resort\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Hotels there that are more private, but Key West is not a place to go to hold up in your room. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a place to get out and have some fun. See the sights! If you are thinking of going to Key West for a family vacation, you may want to consider Sunset Key or some of the Resorts on the south end of the island. That is were all of the beaches are, however, Key West is really a 21+ vacation spot. We recommend Fury Watersports\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ultimate Adventure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package with the Sunset Sail. We had a blast. $115 per gets you a 2 hour sunset sail (all drinks included) and a 6 hour Ultimate Adventure sail (snorkeling on the reef, jet skis, parasailing, kayaks and swimming plus all the food and drinks you can handle included). Hemingway\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s home was excellent as well as the Customs House museum. And if you stay in the Hilton, you have to take a day trip to Sunset Key\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s beach. Just bring some water shoes, the beaches have smooth coral rocks. As far as bars and restaurants go, Blue Heaven was a great dinner and their Key Lime pie was the best we had. Sloppy Joe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is a great experience, and I recommend the Sloppy Joe and the Conch Fritters. Pepe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s is the best breakfast in town, and Alonso\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Oyster bar had the best seafood. Margaritaville\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s food was pretty good, and they have a great Conch Chowder. Hog\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Breath was OK, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth visiting. Stay away from Big Daddy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Conch House. The food was terrible and the music was just as bad. If you have never been to Key West, there is plenty to keep adults busy for an entire week. Between the bars, restaurants, charter boats, sail boats, museums, shops, sight seeing and just plain walking around you shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get bored, but your under 21 kids may. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on driving anywhere once you get there, but I do recommend renting a scooter, bicycle or electric car (although the electric car is harder to park). A good portion of the tourists get scooters, and they are just as much a Key West icon as the Roosters, Chickens, Sport Drinking, Sunsets and Key Lime Pie. One other note\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 While the Butterfly Conservatory may look like a good idea, unless you are just crazy about butterflies it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not worth the admission price ($15 per). It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s small and crowded. The Tennessee Aquarium has bigger and better one plus two aquariums for the same price! With that said, bring plenty of spending money, everything is expensive, but you probably already figured that! Whether you stay in the Hilton (which did love) or somewhere else (plenty of other high quality resorts, hotels and B&B\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s), just make sure it's on the west side of the island within three blocks of Duval St. The northwest corner is the best to be in the middle of it all, but the southwest is a lot quieter and still close enough to walk to everything.

It was not terrible, but would have been nice to be closer toward the corner near the ocean. We took a sunset wine cruise on the Danger and had a great time. The crew on board was fabulous and we had an incredible sunset that night. We ate dinner over on the Island (Sunset Key) and it was very good.

The service has never been top-notch especially at a high quality hotel. At the pool, the bar is nice because you can get drinks and very good food. However, the wait staff needs some upgrading. One bartender was too busy flirting with girls at the bar or chatting with other customers that he barely served my family. The restaurant Bistro 245 needs work, the wait staff is slow and many are foreign and do not always understand one's needs. Though the service was of poor quality, nothing tops one night near the end of our stay, or should I say early morning. At aproximately 3 AM, the fire alarm went off throughout the hotel. We thought it was just a warning and would go off soon, however the entire hotel was forced to evacuate to Mallory Square for a good hour or so. There were hundreds of tired guests in their underwear and t-shirts waiting for firemen to arrive. I would be less critical if this was the first time something like this ever happened. However, a few years back during Spring Break there was another fire alarm because a drunk Spring Breaker had thought it would be funny to pull the fire alarm. I believe the management needs to improve both service and perhaps make the hotel a place where young Spring Breakers and/or drunk college kids cannot stay. I only say this because all my bad experiences at this hotel have been on account of young college students who are drunk and immature making fools of themselves.

We had a non-waterfront room, however, our view from the balcony included the water and Mallory Square. The room was well-equiped and silent. We ate breakfast daily at Bistro 245, the hotel's restaurant. The food was good and the service friendly. Eating outside looking over the water and cruise ships was a plus. 2) Location: The location of the Hilton is unbeatable. 1 block from Mallory Square and the buzz of Duval Street. 3) Recommendations for Key West Activities: a) Eat at Pisces! It is a ten-block walk up Duval and over a block to Simonton Street. The food is expensive but well worth it, if you want a meal to remember. The restaurant is decorated with Andy Warhol paintings. The signature dish, which lived up to the raves, is the Lobster Tango Mango. You can make reservations at the hotel concierge. b) We also ate at Latitudes, the hotel restaurant on Sunset Key. It was good, but pricey. I would recommend it for the views and food, but not if you are travelling on a budget. c) On Duval Street - Don't bother going to Margaritaville - the food is just okay and you can't even hear the Jimmy Buffett music from the bar very well. Sloppy Joe's was the most fun bar on Duval Street - fantastic live music and good drinks. Hog's Breath was fun too. d) Activities: We took the 1 1/2-hour jetski tour around the island. Surprisingly, it is quite a workout - but very fun. Highly recommended. You can make reservations at the concierge, and the tour leaves right at hotel dock. e) Sunset cruise - We took the $32 pp sunset booze cruise on the Fury. There are more expensive sailboats, but the Fury was wonderful. There is a shaded area, unlike some of the other boats. The waitstaff kept our glasses full with beer, wine, or champagne. f) Aquarium - the aquarium is next door to the hotel. It was lovely for $11 pp admission. Recommended. g) Pirate Soul Museum - this is Philly's Pat Croce's museum. It was cute, but not worth the admission fee of $17 pp. h) Hemingway House - Recommended. Lovely gardens and view of Key West Lighthouse. The gardens are full of the famous 6-toed cats. All in all, it was a terrific vacation away from the cold winter. The people are laid-back and nice. It is a very casual environment - nice sneakers and shorts are perfect even for the fanciest restaurants.

Prior to making reservations I read ALL the reviews listed on trip advisor and decided that it was a safe bet. My reservations were for a Partial gulf view king. My room was on the 3rd floor (there is an elevator). Here is my contribution. I will address this as systematicly as possible so bear with me. Upon arriving in key west at EYW (the airport) I was disappointed that there was no hotel shuttle service available. Nothing that could be done about that I guess. After a brief but in depth cab ride (the driver gave us a varitable metric ton of island information to include which restaurants were the best) we arrived and I was very impressed. The hotel grounds are magnificant and well maintained. The staff at the registration counter were knowledgeable and friendly (and yes they speak English). We were assigned our room and they offered baggage assistance which we declined (we only had 2 moderately sized bags) and we were on our way. Upon arriving at our room the key card entry system worked on the first try (a plus) and we gained entry into our beautiful but simple room. We found the room to be clean and fresh smelling (another plus). The bathroom was clean and brightly lit (a plus for the fiance's make-up application). The only complaint about the bathroom I have is that the tub drained slowly and if you were in the shower for any more than 15 minutes you were standing in ankle deep water (I never did find out why that was, I just assumed that it had something to do with being so close to sea level). Move with me now into the mainroom (bedroom/tv room/lounge room). The bed was awsome. One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on (and it had feather pillows, HUGE plus). The Tv armour held not only the TV, but the mini bar, ice bucket and the room safe also. The TV was large and in good working order. I never open the mini bar so I cannot speak about its contents but it appeared to be of the typical college mini-fridge variety. I do know that it operated quietly and didn't disturb us. I didn't use the safe either but it appeared large enought for several items (wallets, keys, jewelry) I would wager a guess that its size was roughtly 5\"wide x4\" in height x6\" in depth. For those concerned there is an $80(USD) deposit for the safe's key. As I steped tword the balcony I noticed 2 things. First, one of the reviews I read was correct, the in-room A/C is of the old in-wall Holiday Inn variety. This was not a problem though because it was relatively quiet, modern in design and very effectively cooled the room (returning from the pool into the room was always a laugh for us because the room felt so cold). Additionaly it gave us the ability to better control the room temp to our liking (the floor around the A/C unit was damp but as I explained to the fiance' it was just condensation from running 24 hours daily). Secondly, I noticed that the couch did have several stains on it. Not the kind of stains one would worry about in a college dorm room, these appeared to be of the hyper child with a bottle of soda variety (nonetheless a bit of a disappointment). I then exited the room onto the \"partial gulf view balcony.\" Amazing. I didn't expect the view to be as good as an ocean walk-out hut and it wasn't, but the view was awsome (see photo #1). Please not that the balcony is in a triangle form and measures about 6' x5' x4' and only has 2 chairs and 1 small table but were very comfortable on it. That evening at sunset as we were walking out of the room to go enjoy the night life I saw the other great view that we had right out our room's entry door, again it was spectacular (see photo #2). The second day of the trip we went to the pool. There are a limited amount of deck chairs (about 30) so try to be out there early (crowds didn't become an issue until Saturday morning). The pool itself is in some need of repair. Nothing huge, just some cracks and chips. Overall it seemed clean and I had no problem spending hour after hour it in. Please note that the pool has a slight salt water content to it. I spoke with the management and I was informed that it was a conservation/cost based decision that the Hyatt chain made. The salt content is very low and as a testament I was able to open my eyes under water (not a good idea in the ocean). The pool side staff is friendly and the concierge always has fresh towels. Scuttles (the pool side bar/grill) has good food and a generous hand with the spirits, however they are a little pricey, as is Nicola's (the 4 star seafood restaurant that we never tried due to the menu prices). The ocean access from the hotel is great as there is a beach to sit on with a deck chair and a sunbathing platform that you can swim out to. The beach was a little rocky and I would recommend sandalsfor the sensitive, but it was ample in size (not huge, not a small sliver). Also there are boat docks off of the rear deck of Nicola's that I HIGHLY recommend visiting at about midnight. There are lights that allow you to see into the water and the amount of fish that you see is amazing (see photo #3/4/5). My fiance' ran around like a 6 year old with a newly found toy saying \"oh my god, oh my god.\" This hotel was an awsome choice for our stay and we would most assuredly return and stay again. Of the many things this hotel has to offer that I have written about the as yet unmentioned best is its perfect location. This hotel sits at the foot of Front street. You could stand in the middle of the street at the hotels entrance and hear nothing all day long but if you walk the 2 blocks to the corner of Front and Duval the party begins. The nightlife is well inside walking distance (maybe 200 yards from the hotel) but the noise doesn't follow you to your room. The hotel grounds remained quiet and subdued for our entire trip. Key points: Possibly the best location on Key West if you enjoy the night life. Great little beach to play on and to watch the sunset from (a better view that Mallory square whos' view is now block by very large homes). Only steps from the boardwalk and at least 10 excellent (and world famous)restaurants.

We returned for a fabulous anniversary dinner at Lattitude's restaurant via ferry. 7:15 reservations made it that we had lovely evening sun then night time with tiki lights lit. Just a marvelous special dinner!

Plus add in three $10 cosmopolitans, and a glass of wine - and it all adds up very quickly. Normally this would not be our price range but for a 20 year anniversary meal - the atmosphere was worth it! They paid for our creme brulee dessert as a gift.

Monte's has a nice happy hour also, but I would not return there. Too many dogs running around and food was not that great except for the raw bar was good and good price at happy hour. Our waitress picked up a dog and kept servicing customers not washing her hands. It's very laid back - beware.

The Hemingway house is a must see.", "Date": "May 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201c3 Reasons to Avoid the Key West Hilton\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3400056", "Content": "I would offer 3 comments about a recent stay at the Key West Hilton: 1. DO NOT PAY FOR OCEANFRONT ROOMS. I paid a significant price above the standard rate for an oceanfront room. Unfortunately, there was no time during my stay that my family could see the ocean from our room because there are cruise ships docked outside the hotel around the clock. Given that our only view was that of the side of massive cruise ships, we would have had a more enjoyable experience if I had simply booked a courtyard-facing room at a much lower price. Quite frankly, I find the hotel's offering of \"oceanfront\" rooms to be extremely deceptive without being accompanied by some warning that you may never actually see the ocean due to the cruise ships. 2. BE CAREFUL IF YOU WANT NONSMOKING ROOMS. Our reservation confirmed us for a Non-smoking room, but we were given a smoking room upon check-in. When I inquired at the front desk, they denied that the room was smoking. When I returned to the front desk to tell them, despite their claims, that both the room itself and the hallway in which the room was located smelled of smoke, they again insisted that the room was non-smoking. When I returned to point out that neither our room nor any of the other rooms in the same hallway had signs indicating \"non-smoking\", whereas all of the rooms on the other hallway had \"non-smoking\" signs, they stuck to the same story. Finally, however, after 3 tries, they did relocate us to a true non-smoking room. I would suggest that they could have made a good customer happier by simply offering to relocate us at the time of the 1st inquiry. 3. DO NOT PAY FOR SPECIALS THAT INCLUDE BREAKFAST. As the only available rate, I was forced to pay for Bounceback weekend package with the free breakfast. I was OK with the breakfast package, but I think that the hotel should have been prepared to actually serve breakfast to its guests. We visited the hotel restaurant for breakfast 3 times during the stay. On the 1st visit, we left hungry after waiting over 1/2 hours for our food (which consisted of orders of cold cereal and bagels). During this 1st visit, we witnessed another guest furiously return his food because it was cold, and subsequently return the food of the rest of his family because that food had gotten cold while waiting for his food to be warmed. On the 2nd visit, we were turned away and denied a table because the hostess claimed the restaurant was too busy. Curiously, only about 1/4th of the tables were occupied at the time. On the 3rd visit, to our surprise, we actually managed to obtain a table and receive our food. Unfortunately, we thereafter were required to change tables because bugs were found to be crawling on a table immediately next to the one at which we were sitting. In short, a very unpleasant experience all around. We checked out of the hotel 3 days early and moved to the Hyatt hotel right down the street. There, for more than $100 less per night, we had a wonderful view of the ocean (in a nonocean-view room no less), we received a non-smoking room with no questions needing to be asked, and we enjoyed several excellent meals at the hotel restaurant.", "Date": "April 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auburn , CA", "Title": "\u201cRecommend This Hotel\u201d", "Author": "vistaatraveler", "ReviewID": "UR3399548", "Content": "After reviewing many recommendations for Key West on this site, decided on the Hilton during 2005 Spring Break.

I would have been OH SO ANNOYED if i had paid for a true ocean front room, the cruise ship dock there everyday, and no there isnt anything you or the hotel can do about it, i just think they should tell you on the website that if you book a room with a view you might get a huge Mickey Mouse Disney Cruise ship as the view instead of the sunset. The service in the hotel was poor, we stayed for 3 nights and for 2 off those, food from a previous guest was left outside our room, we asked 4 times to have it removed, eventually it was, but that is not the service i expect from this standard of hotel.

However, I felt the hotel was trying hard to squeeze every penny out of you and it does so in a not so subtle manner. First of all, the hotel charges $300 plus a night for room. I will leave to your judgement whether that is fair. What I can tell you is that you get a typical Hilton room with basic amenities. Clean but not fancy. We had breakfast one morning on Hilton's private island off Key West, the Sunset Key. I am usually wary of the stiff price hotel charges for breakfast, so I went down to the Conciege and asked to see a copy of their breakfast menu. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the prices looked fairly reasonable ($6-$10 range) and the Conceige assured me that locals go there all the time for meal so I decided to give it a try. When we arrived at the restaurant on the island, we were shocked to see that the menu had much higher prices. Continental breakfast was $10 (vs. $6 I saw at the conciege), which buys you a muffin (labeled \"island selection of bakery\", a small fruit bowl, juice and coffee. We had breakfast there anyway, thinking that the conciege may have given us an outdated menu by mistake. After a fairly expensive ($40) breakfast, we did a little sunbathing and swimming on the private beach. Soon came lunch time and we decided to order from our chairs on the beach. The beach boy fetched us a menu and again things looked reasonable. I picked a grouper sandwich ($10) and my girlfriend ordered a seafood salad ($14). The food was decent and we had a relaxing meal on the beach. When I asked for the check, the beach boy showed us a bill which put the sandwich at $14 and the salad at $16. The beach boy explained that again we had an outdated menu and prices have changed. I could not help but wondering if it is a systematic approach at this Hilton to \"Bait and Switch\". Although the bill was later adjusted without much hassel, it left a bad taste. On the checkout date, we had three beach passes billed to us, but there were only two of us. That was taken care of after a short conversation and again we wonder how many phony charges went unnoticed and uncontested. It is my first time to spend a few days in Key West (I had a day trip couple of years ago). During our stay there, we had experienced a few similar incidents from other establishments. I felt that the whole island is one BIG tourist trap and is more interested in your wallet than offering hospitality.

We booked the hotel using Hilton Honors points (both of us are diamond members). This hotel is considered top of the line due to price and therefore was in the highest point bracket. Good Points: the location cannot be beat. You can walk anywhere within Old Key West. And we concur with others that the $10 pp to Sunset Key is worth it if you love quiet beaches with waiters bringing you food and drink. However, the service was the worst either of us have ever experienced (and we both travel for a living). We booked a King/Non-Smoking Harbor view and upon check-in received 2 queens overlooking the pool. We requested a room change (since we were to be guaranteed our room type) and got a King overlooking the 'courtyard'. BEWARE - courtyard = alley/dumpster. I cannot imagine anyone paying $300 a night for a tiny balcony overlooking a dumpster. Each time we got moved, the front desk person told us it was the room we were expecting. We would get to the room and it would be a little different than what they told us. We kept getting the impression they were trying to get us 'out of their hair' by telling us what we wanted to hear. We were eventually moved to a king overlooking the pool (albeit the ground floor and a day later) but the worse thing was the attitude of guest services and management to accomodate our request. We never got the harbor view for the 'amazing sunsets' we were promised upon booking. In addition, the rooms are not of the quality one would think of in a $300 a night hotel (beds are comfty, though). In addition, the food is mediocre -- go out to duvall for food.

Also, there is no beach on the mainland, so if you want to go to the beach on Sunset Key, plan on paying the $10. My \"garden view\" room had a balcony and overlooked the outdoor pool which is fairly large. The Hilton is in Mallory Square, which is where the cruise ships dock, so the place is kept exceptionally clean with very nice stores to attract cruise vacationers. I ate breakfast at the Bistro in the hotel every morning which offers a good variety. Happy hour starts in the early evening with exceptional views of the sunset from the second floor bar. Live entertainment and drink specials including $2 draft beers provide a relaxing ambiance. The pier is bustling with activity from street performers and vendors selling their wares to well past sunset. What I liked best about this hotel, though, is it's excellent location. You can watch the cruise ships come and go, enjoy spectacular sunsets during the evening happy hour, and continue on to the famous Duvall Street which is a block and a half away.
