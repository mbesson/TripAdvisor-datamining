The hotel makes a good first impression with a nicely decorated, clean and contemporary lobby. The person that checked us in was helpful and spoke very good English - he was able to tell me about a vegan restaurant within walking distance (vegan is not that popular in Barcelona) so this was very helpful and I really liked the place. Our room was very clean and modern, bathroom was spotless and both rooms were a nice size. Room had a nice TV if you care when on vacation - there were 3 or 4 channels in English. Our room was at the front of the hotel and it was quite noisy because the hotels on a busy street so a lot of street noise and sirens etc. I should have asked if we could move to a room on the other side to see how much of a difference that made but didn't. The bed was a bit hard and either had a cover on it or was made of some sort of foam that made it noisy - whenever you turned over in bed it made a crunching sort of noise that woke me up quite a bit. We booked with breakfast included and it was very good with lots of variety and they were good about refilling dishes even if you went down to breakfast on the later end. My only complaint was that they said soy milk was available if requested but every morning they said they didn't have any which was disappointing. The location is great for the metro and is only 10 min walk to Las Ramblas, very convenient location. We arrived a couple of hours early and our room wasn't available but we were able to leave our bags with the concierge and they have a safe as well so it worked out very well. Getting to the hotel from the airport was pretty straight forward by train and the metro and a lot cheaper than getting a taxi. Pick pockets and theft is a big problem in Barcelona which I didn't realize before our trip - the hotel has info posted on this and tips to safe guard and we didn't have any problems. It's a very interesting and lovely city - great place to visit. I did quite a bit of research on line before booking, reading reviews and looking at prices and I thought this hotel was a good middle of the road choice and after our stay was happy with how it turned out, good solid choice.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bridport, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThis is budget but ok\u201d", "Author": "dorsetpotter", "ReviewID": "UR125762896", "Content": "This hotel is budget end of the market, but it is ok, good location, nice helpful staff.Walls a bit thin, but we did have loud neighbours.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utrecht, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay!!!\u201d", "Author": "Marion v", "ReviewID": "UR123553202", "Content": "I stayed from 19- 23 january.

Realistically, this is a 3 star hotel in a somewhat questionable area. Pros - The value is decent. I only paid 120 dollars a night and that's a fair price. The staff is helpful. I requested their assistance on a few things and they did the best that they could. The rooms are not bad. I wasn't \"wowed\" by any means, but not upset about the size of the room or amenities. I will say that my room was facing the road and it is loud at all hours of the night. Cons - This isn't the best part of Barcelona. Yes, it is located near many things.....but you are going to pass the pimps, hookers, drug dealers and really strange people that seem awkwardly standing around for no reason to get to your destination. Pedantic as it may be, the smoke detectors have two flashing lights which is quite annoying. As you are trying to adjust to the time zone change, these flashing lights make it really difficult to fall asleep. It's not major if you sleep on your stomach. Conclusion - If you book the hotel knowing that this is really a three star hotel in a not so glamorous part of town, then you won't be really let down when you get here. Knowing what I know now, I would book the hotel in a slightly better location with direct access to the La Rambla shopping area. It seems like we were constantly on that street for food and to get to all of the Gaudi stuff, as well as the Picasso museum.", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ancaster", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Stivonovich", "ReviewID": "UR116808041", "Content": "The hotel is clean, quiet and very secure.

This is a budget hotel (hostel) which is accessed by a door to the left of a Bank and the rooms are on the second floor where there is a small hotel reception. I travelled with 2 friends and stayed in a triple room which was a bit small for 3 adults but it was clean and beds were made each day. There are no other facilities and definitely no rooftop pool. The location is very good, being about 10 minutes walk from Las Ramblas and very near to Passaig de Gracia which is an upmarket shopping area. If you are travelling from the airport I would suggest you get the airport train (0.80 euros if you buy a T10 card) as it stops immediately next to the hotel. Staff were friendly and the room had a safe which you could use for a refundable deposit of 10 euros. Barcelona was lovely although there is the ever present threat of pickpockets - we saw 2 women have bags taken whilst we were there although we were are very careful and had no problems ourselves. We went to watch Barcelona which was great and tickets are easy to get unless it is a really big game.

It is also a good central location for both La Rambla and the Eixample sites. This is a good no frills basic hotel. The biggest problem for us was the noise. The walls and halls not only don't suppress the noise, they seem to amplify it. (I know thats' impossible) Doors opening/closing and footsteps on the bare/loose wood floors sound like gunshots when you are trying to sleep. Loud talking neighbors returning late at night from the bars sound like they are in your room. Overall it was about what we expected for 65 Euros a night. The main thing I want to say is that many of the reviews here are for a different hotel. All the reviews that talk about rooftop pools, exercise rooms, and how close they are to the Paral-lel Metro stop are talking about a different, more expensive hotel.

I had read the previous reviews of the hotel on Trip Advisor prior to booking so I had an idea that the hotel would be reasonable for the price. We arrived at the hotel later than expected and were greeted at reception by a man who was clearly very busy, but remained helpful. We were checked in to room 907 on the top floor. When we arrived at the room we were astounded to realise that we had been given the 'skyline suite' - the best accommodation in the hotel! The suite was spacious, airy, well decorated/furnished and scrupulously clean - comprising of a dining area, secondary bathroom, sitting room, external balcony , en suite bathroom and bedroom. See photographs. The suite was lined on the external side with french windows looking out on a fantastic view over the city. The doors led out onto the balcony which was equipped with table and chairs and sunloungers. Back inside, the main bedroom area was well presented with a good mini bar, large flat screen TV and lots of storage. The bedroom and lounge areas had independent air conditioning, TV's, sound systems and lighting. A large wooden sliding door separated the two areas. The master en-suite bathroom had a walk in shower and a jacuzzi bath. The jacuzzi bath sadly didn't work, but we didn't complain just in case the allocation of the suite to us had been a mistake that could have been spotted if we complained! Separate sinks and personal care kits for each person in the room are nice touches, as were the plentiful towels and dressing gowns. The rest of the experience in the hotel was also really good. The lobby areas immediately outside our room were furnished with lots of seats, and PC's for internet access. Free wireless and cable broadband is available throughout the hotel, although it is very slow. Access is faster via the provided computers in the lobby areas. We didn't book breakfast with the room but decided to add it for the first morning after our arrival. The food was served in a buffet style and was fairly typical for a mid price European hotel. We decided not to use the facility again, as better breakfast options are available for less money in the street cafes just outside of the hotel. There is a small rooftop pool and fitness area. We visited this area but didn't use it (simply because it was too hot to do so). It was well presented and maintained and there was a further cafe bar available during opening hours of the roof area. The main reception staff were always able to help us with any queries that we had, and spoke very good English. There are more computers available to use for internet access in the reception lounge area, along with a bar that we didn't visit. Regardless of what time of day we left the hotel (sometimes as late as 2 PM) we returned to find that the room had been serviced. The toiletries/personal care kit was always full and towels replaced. Several other reviewers had commented that staff had directed them to the alleyway adjacent to the hotel in order to reach the Ramblas, and that this was an unsafe area. We walked along this route on several occasions, and whilst I can understand that at night it might not be as safe as using main roads or the metro, the road was busy during the daytime and felt perfectly safe. The hotel is immediately adjacent to a metro station, Parralel. The station also houses the terminus for the funicular railway to Montijuic. Access to the very centre of the city on foot takes about 15 minutes and less by metro. The road itself leads directly to the extreme end of Port Vell and the many attractions on the seafront. We had an absolutely fantastic time in Barcelona, and as a city break within Europe it has to be one for the top ten destinations. There is a huge choice of things to do within a compact and well organised centre. The city is not cheap and entry to nearly all museums and attractions attracts a fee. Food is available for all tastes and budgets, and there is a fantastic selection of wines available. I can't recommend this a place to visit enough. Overall our view of the hotel was obviously influenced fairly heavily by us being lucky enough to get the suite accommodation. That aside, the rest of the hotel was also very good and the staff excellent. I saw inside the other rooms during our stay and would happily return staying in a standard room. I would highly recommend this hotel for those looking for a mid-budget place to stay that's somewhere between a five-start and a travel inn/holiday inn format. During our stay we went out for the evening with some of our friends who were native to Barcelona. They visited our room prior to going out and were very impressed with the hotel, much to our amusement. Interestingly they commented that the group who owned the hotel were better known for being builders of major public buildings in Spain, and had only recently branched out into hotel operations - so far so good!", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Long Island, NY", "Title": "\u201cPleasantly surprised for such a good value\u201d", "Author": "garden_m0m", "ReviewID": "UR37766722", "Content": "We got a great rate on this hotel for 2 rooms for 6 days, and I was concerned that maybe it wasn't in such a great section.

There was OK food right on the block, but it's not a fancy neighborhood. There are 2 metro lines right outside the door of the hotel which whisked us to everywhere we wanted to go. We even took the airport bus to Placa Espania and the metro to the hotel. We had never been to Barcelona before & speak limited Spanish, but this was all pretty easy to figure out. If you're on the street side of the building, there will be a little noise in your room at night. We were on the 7th floor & at first our window wouldn't quite close all the way, but they fixed it & that helped. The streets on the 5 - 10 minute walk to the Ramblas are a little grubby & there's some ethnic mix to the people, but we never had any problems & never felt in danger. We even walked back one night after 12 when the metro had closed - our girls walked 1/2 a block ahead of us & were only approached by people handing out fliers for bars. We're from NYC & we kept our eyes open, but it was fine. It was nice to be able to stop in a supermarket up the block & get some snacks. We found the people at the hotel very helpful. We got in at about 10 & couldn't check in until 3, but they held our bags & were very charming. I guess we could have used the locker rooms by the pool if we had been eager to shower or change. The only reason I don't give this hotel a perfect score is that I didn't find it extraordinary in any way.

If you like a little walking this is great location and great hotel and a better value than a lot of the other tourist places. All the staff we came into contact with were friendly and spoke english.

I always use this site and thought it was about time I contributed!. Hotel is 4 star, very corporate I think it may be more a buisness hotel. If you prefer character I would suggest it's not for you, but I personally liked it. Very clean, small rooftop pool ( must go up to the roof fab views of the city) a short walk from Metro (Paral-el on line 3.) And a stroll to the Ramblas. Breakfast is buffet style and worth having to set you up for the day (I think it added about \u00a325 to our 3 nigt stay which I think is worth it.) A number of staff speak english. The only down side for me was the beds- not the most comfortable and only 1 pillow!, that said with all the walking I still slept soundly. Top tips for Barceloan include: get the local bus form the airport into the city, it's cheap and runs form out front going to both Plaza Espanya ( can get onto the metro there for this hotel) and Plaza Catalunya ( which is right in the centre.) Dont go to MontJuic park on Sunday!, unless you are prepared to que. We went to go on the cable car and turned round as the que was so huge, even this early in the year, went back Monday and walked straight on!. Finally do the Bus tour (Barcelona Bus Turistica) there are 3 routs covering the whole city, 20 euro's for a one day ticket I relaly cant recommend it enough, saves the feet and you gte to see everything and then can then re visit the things you relaly want to see.

The Hotel Universal in Barcelona favours the gullible. A long review, but this is what Laurence Lewellen-Hairdo never tells you on the Travel Programme. My partner and myself spent a week at a fantastic resort hotel near Salou (The hotel Estival. Stay there. Its ace). I thought it was a good idea to travel to Barcelona and stay the night (and next day) in a supposedly enchanting city before flying back to the UK. Let me explain. I had been nagging for almost 2 years for us to take a holiday together so my hopes were fairly high, especially looking at the Universal's website and descriptions. But oh what a major disappointment would be waiting for us. Yes it is now cheap to fly into Barcelona since everywhere is rapidly becoming 'Ryanised' (Ryan Air are advancing faster than a Starbucks cafe opening programme). And that my friends is exactly what Barcelona is.... cheap. Not financially because it is unbelievably pricey in the cafes, shops and so on. Even the market stalls seem to cost more than a BUPA hip operation. Cheap because of the dirt, smells, traffic smog and the general low life people you find in the district surrounding The Universal Hotel. The room was fairly contemporary but resembled a zoo on our arrival due to all the people in the very small lobby. I had emailed them in advance asking for a 'quiet room' having read reviews about how noisy this hotel was supposed to be. I repeat again, 'a quiet room'. However, because it said we were arriving two hours later than our actual arrival, they wouldn't let us have our room, although the clerk told me it had been cleaned and made up. There was no logical explanation for this room denial obsession other than 'its not allowed'. When we eventually gained access to our promised pleasure dome ( they told us they had given us a really quiet room and one of the finer ones), we found a contemporary attempt at decor - basically everywhere was MDF'd half to death and coloured brown. The beds would have suited Grumpy, Sleepy, Doc and the other dwarves. They were tiny and resembled camping beds. The bathroom was lovely I have to say, with the best little pack of freebie toiletries I've seen for a while. Although I had to go to reception to obtain another pack as there were two of us. As for the language, at first the staff spoke good English until that is, anything critical was mentioned about the hotel or its service. Then they would simply pretend not to understand. Neither would they converse in Spanish - whether a diversion tactic or simply because this part of Spain (Catalunya) have their own 'language' much different to mainstream Spanish and they simply refuse to speak it. Everywhere slogans and grafiti declared 'Catalunya is not Spain' as they seek their independence. For me, they can have it and one of the best things to do is to build a large Berlin-esque wall around the place. The district where the Universal is located is so grubby, its like being in a third world tin-pot country somewhere. About 100 yards along the street and you see more tramps and vagrants, drunks and hobos than I have ever seen in one place anywhere. Every empty doorway seemed occupied by them. The food choices are pretty diabolical although I can reccomend a lebanese owned cafe which is near the hotel despite its unbelievably garish orange plastic interior. You wanna see what prostitutes actually do in their spare time? then there is a treat in store for you if you choose to stay at The Universal. I was sat having coffee at The Lebanese place (outside) and from nowhere, 4 hookers started arguing and shouting. Then the pimp turned up, slapped two of them around and then another 11 prostitutes turned up and it was like WW III. Fighting, scrapping, throwing each other into the road and onto my table. The area is one of the seediest and dirty places I have ever seen, and I've been to Hong Kong, Bankok and New York. This district takes the proverbial biscuit. Watch out also for the dozens of the most twisted, deformed dwarfs and disabled people you've ever seen in your life begging on the street corners. Children will be terrified by some of the deformities. I know I was. It was like having your own private Ripley's Believe it or Not freak show on the doorstep of the hotel. Turning back to the hotel and our 'fine quiet room'. it was the noisiest room I have ever stayed in. it was right opposite the lift which sounded all night as though a truck was driving up and down the hallway. I asked for a transfer and was told 'is not possible. Is not allowed' and they claimed to be full. However, he said there was no one to clean the room. That's when the convenient forgetting of English and Spanish kicked in. The noise from the neighbouring rooms was dreadful. everytime anyone went to the toilet, you could hear every single trickle, grunt and otherwise because the walls were so paper thin. The noise of people coming and going, snoring and even love-making made a night's decent sleep virtually impossible.I was rather put out that my own desire for romantic city passions were crushed \"In case anyone hears\". Thank you paper thin walls! The next morning, breakfast was a very unpleasant experience. We had to mill around completely ignored by the two waiting staff. eventually we sat ourselves to the only vacant table which was littered with the remains of earlier breakfast and stained with spilled coffee. The cutlery was dirty, the plates were dirty and cracked (and I mean really cracked), some with chips out of them and even the cups were dirty.This was lots of the cutlery/ crockery not just an isolated few.Breakfast was reasonable but no way was it a sumptious buffet. The dining room was about the size of the living room of an average semi detached house lounge. As far as the hotel is concerned, forget about complaining, as they simply do not wish to know. They have a complaint form to fill in which I was told \"are not read by anyone or acted upon\". The gym is basically a small room with 4 exercise bikes in it and the pool is only open from May to September. The views from the roof are basically like looking at a Gypsey shanty town, which is precisely what surrounds the hotel. See attached photos. A lovely sight if you look out of your hotel room windows. There is a saying that you get what you pay for. Although this hotel was through lastminute.com as a 'secret hotel' (four star or above who dont want to reveal their name), I can understand why if you know where it is and the service you receive there. At most I would only give this place a 2 star rating. My advice is to save your money and book elsewhere. This hotel is a complete waste of money and effort. Disappointment, noise, grime, poor service, tiny beds, drunken hen parties peeing openly in the street, prostitute fights, vagabonds and constant emergency vehicle sirens all day and night are the only things that await you. Add this to the constant loud construction noise and the screaming and loud music and dogs barking from the slum housing surrounding the hotel, and I think you should be booking elsewhere in a hurry.

The bathroom is nice and was always kept clean - supplied with bath sponge, shaving kit, dental kit, comb, soap, shampoo and bath gel as well as a shoe shine sponge. The only downside was the noise which came from the street at night and in the early morning as well as noise which travelled from the hallways when guests came in and out.
