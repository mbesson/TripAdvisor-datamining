It was brilliant in every way. I'm really shocked to read the review by Fab4 which bears no resemblance at all to the reality we experienced. The Hotel was incredibly comfortable, well-organised, and brilliantly situated a stone's throw from the centre of Venice. There are hidden FREE extras that add even more to the value of the stay. For example, a complimentary boat-ride to and guided tour of Cenedese, a glass-blowing company on the island of Murano would probably normally cost two people at least a 100 euros. It cost us nothing at all, and was one of the finest experiences. Factor that into an already reasonably priced sojourn and you begin to appreciate the value of staying in this hotel. In addition, the concierge went out of his way to ensure that our choice among the many attractive musical and opera options available resulted in a truly unique experience. The concierge was not interested in merely doing what was expected: he went much further and ensured that his guests enjoyed those extra delights on offer in this incredible city. A couple of requests we made late at night - an extra blanket on one night and a pot of boiling water (not tea) on another night - resulted in delivery on each occasion in no more than a couple of minutes and with customary warmth and good humour. Our room was spacious and comfortable, great shower and bath facilities with ample gushing hot water, high ceilings, quiet second-floor solitude with shutters ensuring peace and quiet. Breakfast worked like a charm, with intelligent buffet lay-out to preclude queues, and staff warmly in attendance to ensure one's every need.

The room was very hot on our arrival & their air con does not work in the winter so we opened the 2 windows wide...big mistake as I was bitten by something on my wrist that night.. we remembered to close the windows at dusk..( March 2012)..but the cleaners still turned the heating back up every day despite us turning it off !!! There was a fridge & safe contained within a locked glass fronted cupboard to which we had the key, which was useful. The bathroom was fine as was the shower & there was a hairdrier which actually worked. The breakfasts have been well described by many others & are excellent, the staff are great & seem to know everything & anything about Venice. We went to Murano on the water taxi ...a freebie from this hotel....worth it even if you do end up at the glass factory of their choice.....well worth it for the other bits of Venice you see on the way...after the tour, we arranged to stay longer & had lunch there before our return. The Hotel also arranged our Gondola trip, which although not cheap was well worth it! The location is wonderful, the sundeck shows the 360 degree panaramic view of the city,. We did check our emails one day using their computers on the 2nd floor, but with so much more to do it was not that important to us.

The hotel staff was amazingly helpful and offered suggestions on everything from where to go, what times to go, where to eat, what to order, etc. They have a complimentary shuttle to Murano glass factory that we did not attend but others said it was good. The room we stayed in was nice (#78); interior room over looking a courtyard with very high ceilings and large windows, seperate bathtub and shower and lots of closets. The bed was king size and a bit firm with lots of pillows. There was a desk, couch and table area. There was air conditioning but we didn't need it. The hotel has a roof deck with lounge chairs and great 360 views, it provided a nice back drop for a bottle of wine one late afternoon. the breakfast was great with plentiful offerings of traditional italian, british and american breakfast. The location of the hotel was ideal for us, less than five minute walk to piazza san marco, less than ten minute walk to Academia Bridge and Rialto bridge. The hotel is located on the \"5th avenue\" of Venice with high end retail all around. The Hotel Regina Europa is three blocks away on the grand canal. I only mention as a point of reference because not many people, Venitians included, knew where the hotel was when they asked where we were staying. The only negative thing we experienced at the hotel was the internet connection, it is complimentary but you get a temporary username and password from the front desk for 3hrs. We found the connection to drop frequently and could not get back on with the same username and password. We were using an ipad and a macbook, maybe that had something to do with it but it was really annoying....but we weren't there to be on the internet so it wasn't a big deal. All in all, we really enjoyed the hotel and the staff.

I thought that I could never ever be made to feel unwanted or unappreciated in any hotel in Venice, so choosing was easy, then one very warm summers day I came across a restaurant in a courtyard, I had passed it many times, its bright yellow decor of tablecloths and flora, antique wall furnishings and scene beckoned me to stop and look, and I did, I fell in love with the magic that was clearly in every corner of this outdoor room, no matter if in the day or evening this little gem of a place was truly romantic, what ever visions I had of Venice, whatever thoughts or dreams I had of this place they all seemed to gather in this one place. I reserved a table for lunch, and what a lunch it was....the service the style and the content both food and wine, confirmed my belief that this was a very much loved place where those who really appreciated the finer things in life would have come to and returned time after time. The opportunity came for me to wander around the hotel that this fine restaurant belonged to, and it was here I found the Saturnia International Hotel. I couldnt wait until my next trip to Venice, I decided there and then to take a week in this wonderful palace of Venetian hospitality. It was no surprise that this hotel had received some pretty important guests over the years, and it was not hard to understand why they returned time and time again. From the outside it looks warm, even in the coldest of winters, during the summer the courtyard restaurants colourful display invited you in, the moment you arrived at reception, you were met by a smile that said welcome to our home, please sit awhile, relax, what can we do for you....our time is yours, nothing is too much trouble, we are here because we want to be, because we like you, value your custom and we thrive on being of service in any way possible. This was done and said conveyed to anyone who walked through the door, and the staff no matter front of house or back, cleaners or management, they all loved the opportunity to be of service to you. Time went by very quickly, my return to Venice was made much more special, because we were going to the teatro Fenice, and the beauty was much more than anyone could ever hope for, the Saturnia was the icing on the cake and I can honestly say each day was made increasingly more romantic with the love that came out of every nook and cranny of this adorable hotel, we hated to leave, but we looked forward to our return, we left wanting more, and year after year it just got better, and so although this is an opinion I hope with all my heart that you try it for yourself, a special place for special people wanting to celebrate life, with a eye on the past and eye on the future, and a hug that says welcome to Venice. I would always say that to arrive in Venice, one must take a water taxi, the view from these very stylish boats is one that is worth every penny, the experience one not to miss and the magic is amazing, when you arrive at your hotels doorstep, what a way to arrive.....

However, the highlight was the bathroom with it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s deep, oval shaped bath with hand-held showerhead, large basin with a practical shelf underneath for toilet bags, plus a separate shower room with a huge rainwater showerhead and lots of hot water. Although lovely toiletries were supplied, the hairdryer was the cheap, wall attached variety and no bathrobes were supplied \u00e2\u20ac\u201c minor disappointments really.

Every time we passed Reception thereafter we were warmly greeted by name and stopped for a quick chat. Our New Year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Eve degustation dinner with accompanying wines was wonderful and the wait staff were professional yet having fun too. The day before I had met with the ma\u00c3\u00aetre d' to discuss the menu as I have a food allergy. An offending course was easily substituted with something (more delicious in my opinion) from the regular menu without leaving me feeling as if I had caused any issue. We normally don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat in hotel restaurants as we tend to find them overpriced, but NYE was worth every Euro. Circumstance meant we had to eat again in the restaurant on our last evening and the wait staff remembered us from NYE and helped to make it another special occasion. We can also suggest a small wine bar/trattoria, Vino Vino, on C d Veste just around the corner from the hotel where the atmosphere was certainly less formal and food prices more economical, however, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any decals (not to say they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there) advertising acceptance of credit cards and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t observe anyone paying by card so we chose to pay by cash to prevent any embarrassment. We had arrived in Venice by train and managed to negotiate the vaporetto system to the nearest stop (S.

Our 2 nights at the Saturnia were pretty bad. We got one of those rooms that have a small sitting area and bathroom downstairs, and the bed was in a loft upstairs. Our \"view\" was of a tiny courtyard which looked directly into the windows on the other side of the courtyard. Luckily we only had two small windows and the window shades didn't open on either so we didn't see anybody and nobody saw us. The people at the front desk were tolerant, that's the best I can say. They acted as if we were a necessary evil and I quickly learned to avoid them at all costs. BTW they were all men; we never saw this woman everybody raves about. They did offer us a complimentary excursion to Murano as our room was not ready when we checked in but we had already booked one for the following day so we didn't go. We had just come off a cruise ship and did not have an electricity converter but in our travels we have discovered that most hotels have them. I called the front desk and asked if they did and they said yes I could come get one, and \"madam, would you pleeeeze stop pulling the alarm cord\". What? I figured I just didn't understand him cuz I had no idea what he was talking about. Come to find out my husband had pulled an alarm cord in the bathroom looking for a way to turn the fan on. (The fan that did not work AT ALL. Oh it made a noise but the minute you turned the shower on all the mirrors fogged up and stayed that way till you opened the door.) My husband picked up the converter from the front desk, brought it up and tried to make it work. He got a nasty shock from it, couldn't get it to work and asked if they had another. They said it was all they had and we went out and bought our own. The shower was almost unusable. There was no way to set the water temperature which went in short intervals from cold to super-hot. So I took a cold-ish shower, having to literally step out of the shower each time the hot cycle came around. It was ridiculous. The bed was hard and so were the pillows. The lighting up in that loft was not enough to read a book. The couch in the sitting room was so delapidated you could hardly sit in it. And the zipper on one of the cushion covers was broken so the cover would slip off making it even harder to sit. We went up to the roof looking for the drinks and snacks other people have talked about but all that was up there were sun lounges. It was a nice little area but no evidence of drinks or snacks. Maybe it's a seasonal thing, although we were there in September, it was still good and hot and the tourist season supposedly goes thru the end of October, but whatever.

Our tariff included a buffet breakfast which was of high quality and would offer something to everyone except the fussiest of palates. The accommodation itself is what I would call \"quaint\".

I therefore had to chose carefully the various places we visited and most importantly the hotels. I could not have chosen a better hotel than The Hotel Saturnia in Venice. Firstly the Hotel is situated in an absolutely prime location; steps away from St. Mark's Square as well as the Bridge to the Accademia and not far from The Rialto Bridge as well. The Hotel is also located right on the very best street for shopping and viewing all of the typical Venetian passageways and craft shops. The interior of the Hotel is quite charming and historic; dating back to the 16th and 17th centuries with original tile, mosaics, furnishings and art work. The Guest Rooms are very spacious and offer a variety of shapes and sizes; some offer canal views and some have quite opulent and ornate palazzo type furnishings while others have more of an art deco style but all are quite lovely and spacious. The staff are warm and friendly and make you feel at home. The very lovely restaurant La Caravella is most beautiful day and night and is situated in a garden filled courtyard within the Hotel. A very nice Breakfast Buffet is served there al fresco each morning; weather permitting. Most important and most important for any visitor and hotel guest; Andrea Scarpa the Chef Concierge of The Hotel Saturnia is one of the best in the business; if not The Best!! Not only is he so well connected and knowledgeable of Venice but one feels as though he is your best friend!! Andrea is a member of Les Clefs d'Or (The Golden Keys) symbolic of the ultimate service in friendship!!

The bathroom was well decorated in a neutral marble and everything was very clean and modern. Lovely separate walk in wet shower with separate bath. The room was warm so we had to leave the french doors open at night which did create some noise until after midnight from the hotel opposite the narrow canal we were facing. Service at the main desk was excellent. We could have done with some good restaurant recommendations as although the hotel restaurant looked good we didnt want fine dining though so went to two local restaurants that were absolutely rubbish.... the hotel hadnt recommended these though so it wasnt their fault. Some really good restaurant guidelines for new visitors would be really helpful to avoid guests visiting expensive poor restaurants. Breakfast was only average unfortunately - the best thing about the restaurant was the quality espresso coffee . I asked for an omelette to be made and was told it was possible but I would have to pay extra for this as it wasnt included in the breakfast.

It was an eye watering 120 euros but is the only way to arrive in Venice and between six it was a little less shocking, only just! Rooms varied and our three rooms were quirky and full of character and quite large for Venice. However, I found the beds very uncomfortable - rock hard and too short. The pillows were also like bricks so sleep quality for me was poor. The bathrooms in our three rooms were exceptional however. We had the smallest but it was still beautifully designed and top quality. The rooms were sparcely furnished but all our bed headboards were very over the top and impressive. The decor was very smart (fabric and polished plaster in our room) and in good condition but the other pieces of bedroom furniture looked like they'd been picked up at a flea market. Bedlinens and towels were changed every day even if not needed and good quality. We had a very efficient heated towel rail in the bathroom. Breakfast was very good - plenty of choice, (mostly) hot and cold. We were there over a weekend and the hotel was busy.

Having travelled to Venice numerous times, and staying either on Riva degli Shiavoni for its great Lagoon views or hotels next to vaporetto stops, I had opted to stay one night here during Carnevale 2011 for great shopping - and it does serve its purpose. A few months before booking, I was emailed a number of junior suites to choose from - what a great service! However, I unwittingly chose the room 86, which was on the top floor with a medium sized terrace (with chairs and tables), overlooking the roof tops of Venice. The room is not large by any means but it does have a good size bathroom and terrace. However, this not-as-yet renovated room has sloppy beds (husband had a painful back after just one night!) and either too hard or too soft pillows, a problem which seems to be the norm in Italian hotels (so, no surprises here). The floor is wooden and is squeaky when one visits the loo in the night and you might disturb the other sleeping partner. Breakfast wise, surprisingly for a rather large hotel in Venice, is rather low in range as well as in quality. We had a simple breakfast and left Venice early for Florence via its nearest vaporetto stop, the Gilgio stop (near Hotel Ala and Gritti Palace). Overall, our stay was only average given the fact that I had personally chosen the wrong suite, so had no one else to blame ...But the Hotel does served its purpose for shopping and its common areas are indeed quite beautiful and very Venetian! However, do be very cautious of the nearby Ristorante Alla Borsa (out of the Saturnia, turn left and turn left again into a small alley, the very first restaurant that you would come across)! They charged us a whopping 71.50 euros for a two course dinner (one dish per person) with a 37.5cl of Cabernet. Service charge was 9.50 euros for 2 persons, no wonder only two tables were occupied on both of the Carnevale nights (peak Venetian season!) that we were there, do be aware!

Another concierge was equally helpful, with plentiful recommendations for places to eat that were based on his own experience and were obviously local haunts. We felt welcome and looked after. The only slight negative was a lack of decent internet connection - in order to connect one had to go to 1st floor to a specially designated area in a rather beautiful drawing room.

Get the ATVO bus - they just wait outside for the incoming flights. You can get your tickets at the airport and the kiosk is really easy to see.

I pitied the poor people who had to get out of their warm beds to see that the walkways were in place where required. Quite a few places have flood gates but we did see shops having to sweep out the water, one of the downsides to Paradise. On Sunday was the Festa de Maria della Salute. The church was very near and we were able to walk across the canal on the temporary bridge erected for the occasion. The rain was heavy but it did not stop the thousands who came to pay their respects and light candles for a year of good health. A stunning church, full to bursting, listening to the Cardinal deliver his message. Great to be part of a local tradition. Location is near to St Marks Square, but very near a water bus if required.

They have a generosity of spirit that we have not experienced in any stay in the USA. Not that I don't love my country, but this is true. They also have a way of distinguishing their lobby area. The hotel's owners produce an annual calendar which has a Venetian theme. Since their inception in 1981, they have a framed copy of each year in the lobby. A treat to look at and you will always remember this hotel's decor because of it. Another wonderful factor is the hotel's location. If you are into history, St. Mark's Square is a short stroll away crossing bridges with gondola's at your feet. If you are a shopper, Louis Vuitton, Prada, Channel..... are feet from the hotel entrance! Something for everyone!!

The hotel is evidently very old and, I believe, family run. The decor in my extremely spacious room, which has a 6ft (1800mm) bed, is in good order and the room appears clean. Furnishings appear old but are in reasonable order. The bed is very comfortable. The rooms are air-conditioned and the noise from the equipment, whilst not silent, is reasonably unobtrusive. Generally, room soundproofing appears only adequate; unlike more modern properties, the main door opens immediately into the main part of the room and consequently the bed is close to it. There is therefore the risk (mercifully not realised on my visit) of corridor noise from the lift and stairs which are just outside. There was, however, during the daytime, some quite intrusive banging and shuffling penetrating from elsewhere. And, being on the top floor, my room was close to the air-conditioning equipment outside which produced an incessant cycling low hum which was just audible enough to be an irritation. There is a mini-bar which is typically over-priced. The hotel has a wireless Internet offering plus some desktop machines in a public area for guests' use. The service is chargeable, although at EUR2.00 for 3 hours non-contiguous use I don't consider it expensive. The connection was, however highly variable (this was a technical problem, not a WiFi signal reception issue) and I had to re-start my connection many times; one might expect better from a service that bears even a nominal charge. There is a wide flat-screen TV with many channels, a few of which are in other languages. The en-suite bathroom is of adequate size and is fitted with old ceramics and plumbing - I guess from the style and colour, from the 1970's. The shower head (over the bath) barely produces a dribble. There are cracks in the tiling and sealant, and less obvious surfaces (like the window frame and hairdryer base unit) haven't seen a duster for months, possibly years. It's overdue for a substantial refit. Toiletries are a basic offering; everything is there, but, for example, the liquids are in sachets rather than bottles and the soap bars are tiny. There are plenty of towels. The breakfast buffet is mainly continental style with various bread and pastries, cold fruit, meat and cheese, and yoghurt etc. There is also well prepared scrambled egg, and bacon, neither of which are kept properly warm. The juices are good and the bread is reasonably fresh. On warm mornings, breakfast is served outside. Customer service didn't seem to be in any way exceptional. Greetings were perfunctory. Our tour group (24 people) had an early deparure (by train) scheduled for our last morning, yet, despite the size of the group, there was no question of an earlier than standard (7 am) start to breakfast, which meant a rushed sitting and no opportunity to return to the room afterwards. It tends to suggest that their customers are not a priority in their thinking. Disappointing. What is very unusual for a hotel in the centre of such a very compact city, is the size of the interior. The room is a very good size, but the public spaces, of which there are several spread over the various floors, are huge, each with various antique (style) furnishings and so on. There is also a roof garden with sun loungers for those who wish to relax just away from the noise of the crowds below. The lift is another matter; barely big enough for three. My summary rating reflects the fact that Venice, as a city, has a lot of physical constraints on it; it is a very tourist-centric city and is generally more expensive than many; my guess is that many Venetian hotels are either much smaller or suffer the negatives of this place to a similar degree, or both. For this reason I have perhaps been a little charitable. Perfect location, good sized rooms, but perhaps in need of some work, and could certainly stand some customer service improvement.

The hotel staff were very well prepared, and this was dealt with as a matter of routine (as do all the shopkeepers near the square), and did not cause any discomfort to guests. The hotel staff were kind enough to loan us Wellington's to walk around in, and the square and the palace looked like they stood in the lagoon - this was a truly memorable sight, with gondolas seemingly travelling right up the ancient buildings. Our younger child in particular was in his element, and waddled in the water ecstatically. As the tide subsided within 2-3 hours, alas it was also our time to leave Venice. It had proved to be a wonderful trip, helped enormously by staying at this hotel again. We are looking forward to returning.

We checked in about midnight and were not greeted very nicely by the night front desk receptionist. He demanded our passports and was rude about wanting to keep them instead of letting me wait until he was finished getting the info he needed. We were given room 25 and forced to cram into the tiny elevator with both our large suitcases and the large bellhop. My first thought when we entered the room was that I must have been looking at the wrong hotel on tripadvisor because all the reviews and pictures were good and this didn't compare. The bed was two twins pushed together and you could feel the wooden frame in the middle. It was also super hard and thin with the worst pillows my husband had ever slept on. The ceiling was the best feature, being extremely high and with wooden beams across it. Our window faced the front street which was loud with people at night and construction pounding and drilling beginning in the morning and continuing throughout the day. The noise was also loud within the room, coming from the hall when people walked by and all the rooms around us. I could hear each time a light switch was switched in our neighbor's room. You could hear people talking through the vent in the bathroom, too. Needless to say, we didn't get much sleep during our whole stay. The bathroom was ok sized but needs to be updated. The shower had black mold growing between the tiles and it was the size of a small closet. You hit your elbow on the water temperature handle every time your brought your arm down. The temperature was also inconsistant, ranging from scalding hot to freezing cold. There was a hairdryer machine attached to the wall which I think had been there for 20 years. It took double the time to dry my hair and the handle got burning hot but the air was cool coming out. Breakfast is included with the booking of the room. It was an ok spread but nothing was kept on ice. The meats and cheeses were kept out on platters, which if you got there later, meant the cheese was slightly melted. Didn't want to drink the milk or eat the yogurt since it had been sitting out all morning without being kept on ice. There was a good selection of pastries. The best feature of the hotel is its location. We had slight trouble following the directions to get there but once found, everything else is a short distance away. The only reason I would book this hotel is for the location. Overall, due to the ridiculous price, I expected a much nicer experience. I would never stay here again or recommend this hotel.

The hotel impressed me very much at that time. My husband and I booked our room directly with the hotel, through the internet with their \"Spring Special\". We stayed three nights at the end of our Italy travels. All communications prior to our arrival were very good. We we're arriving by train from Milan. Their instructions were accurate except that they did not warn us of the crowds we'd find on the public water taxis and how inconvenient it was when traveling with more than a carry on bag. The hotel is quite beautiful in the lobby and other public spaces. Very historical and charming. Our room, which faced the street, was large enough, but was awkward with the placement of the TV and there was really no seating except the bed. We had a very small balcony with a window opening onto the street. Unfortunately, and not forewarned, the building directly across was undergoing renovation so there was construction all day and into the early evening. Quite noisy. As ar as the staff; most everyone was friendly except the evening desk clerk who was surly and unfriendly each night. It felt as if we were bothering him. Not the family run atmosphere expected from other reviewers. The breakfast buffet was quite good with a lot of choices. There was limited to no internet access from our room using the passworods and login given. It was suggested to try in the lobby, no better. They never offered the option of using the hotels computers on the third floor. When I did ask the surly night clerk, he suggested using our own. Finally after explaining that we'd tried that numerous times he provided a new password and login. We then found a number of restrictions connecting to US sites. We did not try the Restaurant La Carvella as it was very pricey. Beware of the \"free\" round trip tour to the Murano glass factory. While the ride was wonderful, the tour informative, but a little short and hurried, there's the obigatory tour of the showrooms and some low pressure sales tactics which I did not appreciate or want. The other disappointment was a recommendation from Mr. Surly for a close restaurant. Must have been a relative. The food was awful and service worse. I'll review it under restaurants.

Breakfast (served until 10:30) was good but nothing special and we did have to wait 5-10 minutes for a table on one or two mornings. The central location couldn't be better (unless you prefer a quieter and more secluded place). Sitting on a large (but expensive) shopping street, and very close to everything (including an ATM and a bookstore). San Moise church greets you from a half-block away. Five minute walk to Saint Mark's square. Five minute walk to two Vaporetto stops (then easy access to the train station, airport, Murano, Burano, San Giorgio, etc). Easy walk to Rialto Bridge, Accademia Bridge, Peggy Guggenheim Museum, etc. Front desk staff-members were extremely helpful. Internet access from two PC's on the second floor. Buy a 3-hour login/password from the front desk for 2 Euro's (which easily covered our entire stay). Nice view from the small rooftop terrace. Our basic Venice tip: Get some photos of (and from) the Rialto Bridge. Do the St Mark's attractions (Basilica, Bell-tower, Doge's), and then spend the rest of your vacation as far away as possible from these two crowded, expensive, pigeon-infested, tourist spots. Truly the best part of Venice is wandering around and getting lost among the maze-like side-streets where the food is better and cheaper, the stores are more interesting, and the crowds are much thinner. Then again, maybe the smart tip is to simply not go in August! I can't speak for the other rooms in this hotel, but if you can successfully request #106, you'll be very happy!

Only stayed one night at the Hotel Saturnia. First the location - it is right on one of the main fashion streets with Hermes, Gucci, Prada, etc nearby. It's a couple of long blocks (in US terms) back to St Marks Square, and also convienent to walk to Rialto Bridge or Acadamia Gallery area. Not sure there would be a better location, expect for maybe the hotels on the opposite side of the street where you may have Grand Canal views from some rooms. Entering the hotel, you really feel that you step back in time. Everything looks old, but in a nice, comfortable way. The front desk dominates the lobby/reception area. It's interesting that they still use ledgers to track the rooms and also provide old fashioned room keys for each room, which you drop off and pick up each time you enter and leave the hotel. Kind of nice in that you get to chat briefly with the front desk staff, who are very helpful in offering planning for your stay in Venice. Had a room on the second floor (which I think they consider the first floor of rooms. Ours overlooked the beautiful courtyard which is used for the restaurant attached to the hotel.

The room was huge and quite a surprise for what I had expected for Venice, or anywhere in Europe for that matter. The beds were very comfortable. Our bath had been renovated and was a great shower (with rain showerhead and separate handheld nozzle) and a large soaking tub. The furnishings were old, but just exactly right to fit with the historic feel of the hotel. The service was quite good while there, especially the front desk which serves as a concierge. One little hint if you stay here, locate the rooftop terrace - which is not that easy to do, and you will be pleasantly surprised to find teak lounge chairs and other seating on a brick terrace overlooking the rooftops of Venice! A great place to rest up for your next walk around Venice. Leaving the hotel for the airport, they can call a water taxi which comes directly to the back of the hotel (easily accessed through the rear of the property off the main lobby).

In the new room the bathtub was extremely slippery and my mom fell. The beds were also sinking in the middle, which would have made for an extremely uncomfortable night. We requested to be moved back to our original room (a noisy room seemed like a better option than an unsafe/uncomfortable one, and the night manager had already given us such a hard time about changing rooms in the first place, we didn't think he'd assign us to a new room), and the manager only did so after much resistance. Overall, the hotel would have been cute, and the rooms will likely be in better condition post-renovations, but our experience with the night manager and other staff was unacceptable.

On arrival we were clearly expected and greeted by name. The rooms were normal european size with the larger superior double big enough to form the gathering point for the present opening on Christmas day (5 people). Bathrooms in both rooms were very smart marble affairs. The hotel has a lovely communal sitting area on the first floor - a great place for residents to gather, lounge and chat. We dined twice in the restaurant. Both meals were exceptionally good. One of them was a \"free\" one (i.e. part of the package) but in our view even surpassed the wonderful meal we paid for.

It's not a 15 min walk and is very doable. Don't eat near the touristy areas near the square or Rialto bride (the food is very pricey and the worst I've had in Italy in 2 weeks). Walk away from there areas and find a smaller, more intimate restaurant (we enjoyed the Ristorante de Carla recommended by Rick Steves).
