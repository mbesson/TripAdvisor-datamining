{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Location We stayed in this very nice hotel almost a week. The location is perfect. We could walk to the Metro, and excellent restaurants and other conveniences were nearby. The hotel is clean, well managed, very secure, and the price very reasonable. The management was extremely accomodating. If I visit Mexico City again, I will definitely stay here.North Carolina", "Date": "Jan 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR871913421", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "flyback"}, {"Content": "Excellent I stayed in this hotel last month. The hotel is in a great location on Reforma Ave. Within walking distance I found some really cool places to hang out, shop, drink!, do whatever. The hotel itself was super clean..my suite was very nice... 2 bedrooms, kitchen, dining room, and small living room. There was no a/c unit there, so at times i did get a little hot, but I guess a/c is un-common throughout Mex City. I have only been to Mex City once, and this is where I stayed, so I can't compare it to other hotels there... hotel employees were very friendly", "Date": "Mar 9, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR890072701", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "good place bad service I was going to have some guests for my wedding in Mexico City, did my research and this was the niciest place i could find for more than a week stay. At the begining everything was great but as i was going to reserve, they asked for full price to be paid in advance!, after a little while i agreed and oh surprise when i took my credit card out THE RATES CHANGED!! since i really liked the place (it was for my in-laws!) i tried to bargain a little bit but unfortunatelly the owner could not give me a better rate because i was paying by credit card, he was so unflexible, stuburn and even rude so at the end i decided to go to another nice place called Suites del Angel.
