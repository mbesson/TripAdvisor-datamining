While the place has likely not been renovated since the 1980's or before, the place has been VERY well maintained. I used to always get rooms on Priceline, minimum 4 stars, whenever we travelled. This time however, the prospect of travelling with an 8 month old and staying in a hotel for 10 days with no kitchen facilities made me think about other alternatives for this trip. I needed a place with a full kitchen, and this place provided that at a very reasonable price. The room was super clean, the carpets were definitely newer and also very clean.

Linens were fresh and beds were very comfortable. I have only stayed at 2* properties a few times before and those experiences were nothing like this place. This place is only 2* because it is a motel-style facility whose appearance could benefit from a face-lift.

Other than that, I only have positives to say about this place. The freeway is close by. The zoo is something like 15 minutes from there.

DVDs were available for checkout. I was on the 2nd floor that had exterior halls and no elevators. This was a pretty quite place, I couldn\u2019t hear my neighbors but could hear a few people walking outside. Also pretty clean. Location about 10 miles from downtown.

Overall, the room was very clean and quaint. There was nothing modern/fancy about it, but it felt very homey. It was so \"old-fashioned\" that even the TV was an \"old\" CRT instead of an LCD. The room that we booked was a suite-style room that included a full kitchen. The room even had a full size refrigerator that we took full advantage of by stocking it up with drinks and breakfast foods. And in the morning, because of the full kitchen, we could actually \"cook\" food with the stove. The only negative I could come up with was that there was no cookie sheet available to use with the oven (so I could bake a pizza and breadsticks). I called the lobby and they said they didn't provide it even though they had virtually all other kitchen tools/utensils. Overall, I'd rate this a 4 out of 5 and would definitely come here again.

The truth is that it's a two star motel with pretensions of being a three star motel but with some serious one star failings. My feeling is that at a three star motel you should feel safe and comfortable. The rooms were noisy. The second floor rooms shook as people walked by outside because of a walkway with a cantilevered design. The heating units were of an older type which means they were hard to control and noisy too boot. The beds were too high (sitting on the bed my feet did not touch the floor) and too soft. Now, as far as safety was concerned, I have some serious doubts about gas stoves in a motel. In addition the location of the motel was in a slightly dicey neighborhood. Note, this motel is not very conveniently located if you are a tourist and there are also not all that many good places to eat nearby.

David allowed us to have an additional trundle bed in the living area for no extra charge. The room whilst not overly large was certainly perfectly adequate for our stay of 6 nights with a large group. The beds were excellent, the room was clean and well maintained - the cleaning staff even made up the kids beds putting their teddy bears on the middle of the pillows - lovely personal touch. The kitchen had full range and stove and microwave - we brought a lot of groceries and made our own meals without any problems. We thought that the free breakfast was fantastic - waffles (kids loved being able to make these themselves - David even made them some as he wandered through the breakfast room one morning as the waffles had stuck and he helped the kids scrape it off, got the machine oiled and then made them a replacement). Other items were cereal, bagels, toast, hard boiled eggs, coffee, hot chocolate, juice, fresh fruit, muffins and pastries. We had our breakfast later in the morning around 9.30am and never had a problem with the breakfast room being full. Free wi-fi worked fine, laundry facilities were a big bonus for us - not having to hunt down a laundromat around the motel. There is a pool that the kids used, and also a bbq in the pool area which we used also. Yes, it is located away from the main tourist areas of San Diego, however we had a rental car and found it very easy to get to where we wanted to go and most places only took about 20 minutes.

It doesn't have anything interesting (that I want) around it. It has a mortuary, a Rite-Aid, a tattoo shop, a bar called \"Effins\", and a place that had a menu in our room called \"Cheba Hut\". Needless to say we drove out of our way to look for shopping and better food. I was happy that our room had a microwave and fridge, but we only used the fridge for our bottled water. The bathrroms are hilariously small. I laughed at the toilet because the opening is too small to use. It doesn't accomodate a large butt.

It was bent inwards like it was about to snap off. I moved it back in its original position so the table wouldn't collapse. Walking on the carpet turned my feet black. It looked like someone seriously cracked the front of the sink, but there was a line where it was glued together, so the motel made an attempt to fix that. When I took a hot shower in the morning I didn't get enough hot water. It ran out about 8-10 minutes into the shower. The steps going up to the second floor by room 218 were burned out at night ao it was very dark. Please fix that. i almost mis-stepped and fell. It's a small parking lot and very tight parking. The walls are very thin. I could hear arguments, conversations, tv's, toilets flushing and showering through them. Also, if get a room on the bottom floor...be prepared to have headlights shining through your window when a car parks. Headlights are at eye level with the motel windows. All in all, I think the people who own this motel try very hard to make this a nice place. There's a dog park behind the motel. They have a continental breakfast in the morning, but I didn't use it. That's a nice thing for guests. They have a dvd player in the room, and i think they have dvd's at the front desk to check out.", "Date": "October 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chico, CA", "Title": "\u201cStay here if it is even close\u201d", "Author": "tsainta", "ReviewID": "UR81393546", "Content": "Great little motel.

If you do not have a car, do not stay here. We came for the sights and hundreds of hotels/motels are better located for the price. If we are 20+minutes from anything (like here) the prices should be in the $75-$90 range. This is a fantastically remodeled motel. The rooms are super clean with no funny smells. The traffic is light (no freeway/train/plane noise). The staff is 100% customer service oriented. I really believe they would do almost anything for their patrons. The beds are the Simmons Beautyrest line (very very soft, but with adequate support). The breakfast is very well done. The one huge problem is the crowded parking area that doesn't have much room to back out of without risk of hitting cars parked behind. There would be no where to park trailers, large trucks, etc. This is the limit of the original design and there is no way to improve it. The owners really have perfected everything possible.

No. But it is a nice continental breakfast with pastries, cereal, bread etc. I just need something light to start my day so this was great for me.

The housekeeping head seemed to really care about the state of the property and our experience. -The pool is not large but is open 7am-10pm and is heated. -The breakfast was basic (no meats) but a nice touch given it was free. The waffles, in particular, were very tasty. -My only caveat is that the walls in the rooms are very thin. If you are a light sleeper or happen to get a loud neighbor (e.g. who might play the tv at a high volume until late) it could make for a tough night.

The only problem I had was the beds. They are too soft and old and one night I could not sleep at all, getting back aches. Most horrible beds we ever had! That\u2019s why I never would come back again. They have a cozy pool in the court which is right on the parking lot and surrounded by plants and trees so you won\u2019t have the expression, it is on the parking lot. Nice place! Seems to be heated. No jacuzzi though. In the back of the buildings (2 complexes) is a guest laundry and even a tiny dog meadow. Wifi-Internet is free but did work only for a few hours, after that we never got connected anymore. But they have a free computer to use in the lobby. So no problem at all.

However as will be found wherever you go there was a rogue few percent who had little consideration for others. These ones slammed doors, talked / shouted loud and late, left a mess on the breakfast room floor and their table full of rubbish for someone else to clear.

BTW, I strongly recommend a room with fridge and microwave, especially if you're with kids. Noteworthy is the fact that there is a VON's supermarket a few blocks away where you will find everything you might need. After a long day on the road, we thoroughly enjoyed their roasted chicken brought back to our room with a glass of wine! Also, there is a delivery pizza nearby called \"Milo's\". Their pizza is top notch. The breakfast is quite basic, as described in other reviews, but OK to start the day. Waffles, cereal, muffins, bagels, toast, boiled eggs, the usual continental breakfast suspects. The room where it is served is indeed quite small and you may have to wait for a table (we did) or else bring the food back to your room; better yet, eat it by the pool.

I decided to give them a call and spoke to someone at 2:00 a.m. their time. To my surprise the night clerk was very pleasant, knowledgeable and gave me a fantastic AARP rate. In less than 10 minutes I had an e-mail confirmation for my reservation. So far, so good. As I approached the Lamplighter I passed San Diego State and realized that the motel would be in a working-class/business neighborhood. Okay with me. There were a number of restaurants nearby and a couple of supermarkets. Mission Valley, for shopping, was only about 6 miles away on I-8. As I pulled in I noticed that the motel was very neat and clean. All of the employees seemed in motion doing something, and several of them were cleaning. We came over on a red-eye and arrived at about noon. I met Len, one of the managers, and he promptly checked my family in early. The room was good-sized, very clean, the furniture and fixtures looked new. Most impressive was that the bathroom was sparkling and there was a Delta massaging shower head that I had seen in a 4-star hotel in the bath/shower--a very nice touch. Better yet, the water flow was strong with lots of hot water--unlike many of the hotels that put those terrible water-saving low-flow shower heads on. A welcome relief to a weary traveler. The beds were very comfortable--better than a lot of hotels costing twice as much. Very important. When I discovered that there was no refrigerator in our room I asked Len about the possibility of getting a room with one. No problem--he had one delivered to our room the next day. The hotel is centrally located. We used it as a jumping off point to visit the Zoo, Wild Animal Park, Legoland (twice), and even Knott's Berry farm. Freeway access is very easy. Hop onto I-8 then you can get to I-15 or the 405 and get anywhere. The best part of the Lamplighter is the staff. Now I know how they got their #2 rating for San Diego area hotels/motels. Dave and Len, the managers, and all of the help were truly nice and friendly. Everyone said hi with a smile and made us feel welcome. Every hour of daylight was used cleaning, fixing, or doing something that made the place nice. Fresh towels on the pool chaises. A nice size pool that was very clean. Immaculate. Breakfast was better than the usual continental fare. It is basic with a couple of nice waffle machines, 3 choices of dry cereals, an assortment of bagels and pastry, fruits, juices, milk, and coffee and it is well-stocked. This definitely saves you time and money in the morning, and they are open until 10:00 a.m., not the usual 9:00 a.m. closing. The staff made great suggestions on places to eat such as the Casa Machado 2 doors away. We had dinner there for 4 out of 6 nights. When you tell them the Lamplighter sent you the service gets even better. The people at the Lamplighter were nicer than staff at a good number of 4-star hotels that I have stayed at. The bottom line is that you could pay a lot more and get a lot less. If Macy's had customer service half as good at the Lamplighter, Nordstroms would be out of business. Aloha from Hawaii.

The hotel was busy but just enough parking spaces for all even though they could be tight if you are parked next to one of those \"US monster trucks\". The room was on the second floor and was a good size, small bathroom, with basin at the end of the bedroom area. Very clean throughout the stay. I had seen some comments about the \"thin walls\" and yes it is true. Seem to be some people waking up at 6am having showers! However, two very comfortable Queen beds and one of the best continental breakfasts on our tour of CA which was always topped up with goodies. The kids are now converted to waffles in the morning. Very nice pool which could have benefitted from having a hot tub, but that is getting picky. The staff were very helpful with ideas on where to go and provided directions. Plenty of leaflets in the lobby and there is a PC with internet access which was very useful. Not much in terms of restaurants within close walking distance, but a short drive up El Cajon Blvd we found Woodstock's Pizza which became a favourite. There are plenty of shops within short driving distance to stock up with beers and refreshments and we made good use of the fridge in the room. I would classify this as an excellent Motel in the suburbs of San Diego. If you are looking for a 5 star Hotel in the city centre with room service, bell boys and all the trimmings of luxury then this will not fit the bill. It is located close to the main highway so excellent access for trips into Downtown San Diego and the brilliant Zoo. One tip is to park at the Old Town for free and get the Trolley into San Diego where kids travel for free. This trolley route goes onwards to Tijuana and makes for a great day out. It was also very good starting point for our next stop in Anza-Borrego via the excellent DZ Akins deli which was located just before we joined the highway Our family of four had a great stay and would recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in the San Diego area.", "Date": "April 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lake Oswego, OR", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "osuguy10", "ReviewID": "UR15171915", "Content": "My family stayed at this hotel last week and the reviews are correct.

Parking: The parking spaces are not large, but enough spaces are provided that I was able to park right in front of my door both Saturday and Sunday nights. 9. Location: It was very convenient to the Interstate 8 ( College Exit number 10 South, then West on El Cajon Blvd. ) yet far enough not to listen to the road noise. 8. Television: A large (at least 25\") television with about fifty channels to choose from. A channel guide on a laminated card and an easy to use remote control were provided. 7: Furnishings: I stayed in a two queen bed room. The beds, desk, dresser and night stand were in lke new condition. A padded bench added extra seating or a place to open your suitcase. At the back of the room was the lavatory on a full width vanity backed by a full width mirror. At the left of this was a hair dryer and the door to the room with a toilet and bath/shower. The shower had a fabric curtain and there were plenty of towels in a rack above the toilet. Soap and shampoo were provided. The curtains were in perfect shape and consisted of a sheer and a light blocking curtain. You could open the window and let in fresh air through the screen or use the very quiet air conditioner below the window. 6. Pool: The outdoor pool has towels draped over the chairs for your use so you don't have to go to the desk for pool towels. This area is used for the overflow seating during breakfast. 5. Maintenance: One reviewer said that the place looks so good that it looks out of place in the neighborhood. I hadn't thought of it that way but but it is truly outstanding. There is great pride of ownership and the In shows it in the landscaping and condition of the rooms. The doors use cardlocks to enter (as does the breakfast room) and everything worked perfectly during my stay. 4. Price: I think that the price was very fair and the value was outstanding. I think that I saved at least $20.00 on breakfast alone. I used the AAA/Senior rate and paid $175.00 total for two nights, all taxes included. 3. Cleanliness: Because I made my reservation only a week before my stay, only a smoking room was available. I called to confirm my reservation and the desk clerk made sure that an ionizer was put in the room to make it more pleasant for my stay. The room and bath (like the whole property ) was spotless and I did not even notice a smell of smoke in the room. I saw the staff cleaning the rooms and they were removing all the bedding in the rooms for washing, even the comforters. During breakfast, a staff member is always present to keep the food stocked and the tables cleaned. 2. Breakfast: The breakfast room is open from 6 am to 10 am. There are only 12 chairs, but you can use the pool area to eat. You have a lot of choices, and I will try to list them all. Muffins, assorted Danish, apple juice, orange juice, coffee, decaf, hot water for tea or oatmeal, 2% or whole milk, two automatic waffle irons, butter, syrup, three cold cereals, bagels, cream cheese, toast and jam, fresh oranges and apples and boiled eggs. There is a television in the room to catch the local news and weather. 1. Staff: The staff was friendly, helpful and treated me as I were staying at a grand hotel. It is from them that all the other great reasons to stay here have originated. I wondered how this Best Western Inn could be so highly rated in the San Diego area.

Impressed by all the positive reviews on tripadvisor, I originally booked for 10 nights. However, before getting there I was a little bit skeptical because I wondered how a relatively inexpensive Best Western hotel could make it to the top five hotels in San Diego, but I was to find out soon enough. Almost everything about this hotel turned out to be awesome. When I arrived, I was upgraded to an upper-floor room with full kitchen, which was pretty spacious and comfortable. Additionally, the room included an iron/ironing board, hair dryer, coffee maker, microwave plus lots of complimentary items - amenities that you usually don't find in hotels in this price range. They also provided dishes, pans, and other kitchen utensils free of charge. Although the hotel is located at El Cajon Blvd, which isn\u2019t a busy street but not a side road either, I didn't notice any disturbing street noise. I also didn\u2019t experience any problems finding a parking space close to my room. Some people might argue that the hotel is not that close to downtown, but then again it is very close to San Diego State University and other interesting venues, so I found it to be an ideal location for me. Breakfast, which was offered between 6 and 10 a.m., was way better than you would expect it to be at a regular Best Western hotel. The breakfast bar was well-stocked with appealing choices, which included waffles, a nice variety of cereals, fresh fruit and assorted pastries. Complimentary coffee was offered in the lobby throughout the day. Although I have never been in the pool it looked very nice and fresh towels were put out every day. The most important thing for me, however, was that the hotel was absolutely clean and that everyone who worked there always strived to provide prompt and outstanding service. Housekeeping was simply amazing, they would rather replace a towel that had not been used or put an extra piece of soap than forget to replace anything. Last but not least, I have to thank all at Best Western Lamplighter Inn (which includes, but is not limited to Len, the amazing front office manager who goes out of his way to give you a pleasant stay) for their help in facilitating my transition to the US and for making my stay a time to remember. I definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn\u2019t want to spend hundreds of dollars a night, but also doesn't want to compromise quality for money. Lamplighter Inn is kind of a hard-to-find gem, as it gets you more value for your dollar than possibly any other hotel in San Diego. Almost forgot to mention that I stayed there 26 days after all.", "Date": "January 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "WEST COVINA", "Title": "\u201cA Great Bargin\u201d", "Author": "SALMEX", "ReviewID": "UR12417105", "Content": "The hotel was very clean and comfortable.

I am VERY picky traveler and usually stay at the Hyatt, Westin or the Sheraton. My family and I stayed here from Dec 23-Dec25 in a family suite, which was the size of two regular rooms. Their suite consisted of a kitchenette, a bathroom, a living room (sofabed), and another room with 2 queens. There is one tv in the living room and another one in the bedroom. There are two outdoor access to our room, one from the living room and one from the bedroom. The rooms and most importantly the bathroom was VERY clean. The two queen mattresses were firm and the sofabed was thin. The pool was clean, heated and open from 8-10 everyday. There are towels on the loungers already. Breakfast consisted of juice, bagels, cereal, hot waffles, and boiled eggs. There is one computer in the lobby with internet access and is complimentary for guests. The amenities are on par with most other really good Best Westerns but the most important detail you would need to know is that the service of both the hotel manager as well as the room stewardesses are absolutely magnificent! For those of you visiting San Diego for the first time, you definitely need to talk to Len, the manager (the one who is always replying through Tripadvisor) because he has alot of details on what to do and see. This is THE hotel to choose if you are bringing any pets with you, as the property caters to pets (there is a little pet area at the end of the property, away from the main street). We booked this trip along with a cruise from our well trusted travel agent and he has definitely gained our loyalty after this trip, as the price was right and the value immeasurable.", "Date": "December 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fresno CA", "Title": "\u201cHad a Great Stay!

This was our first trip to San Diego and we weren't quite sure about the neighborhoods, and I must admit I was a bit hesitant given the great deal we received for a room with a kitchen and the extra for our dog. We were not at all disappointed!!!! The rooms were basic, but clean (the most important thing to most!) There was a queen bed and sofa bed so plenty of room for my husband, daughter and me. Our room had a full kitchen, complete with fridge, stove and microwave. Great setup! The complimentary breakfast was plenty to get us started in the morning; toast, cereal, oatmeal, boiled eggs, pastries and fruit were fine although I must admit I wasn't a big fan of the coffee. The pet area was a bit on the small side so we typically would take our dog for a walk in the morning to take care of her business. Many of the reviews reference the small breakfast area. It probably is much more crowded during the summer, but during Thanksgiving week, we had no problems with seating. For our visits to Sea World, the Zoo, Old Town and all the other touristy spots, the drive was roughly 15-20 minutes, more or less depending upon the time of day. It never seemed to take very long and was an easy drive with our GPS. Easy access on/off the freeways. We found parking at the hotel to be no problem. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit, especially if we bring our dog, as there aren't many nice, clean hotels/motels which allow dogs weighing more than 30 lbs (ours weighs 50+) Thanks, BW Lamplighter, for the wonderful stay!!!", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cbargain break\u201d", "Author": "ashcan", "ReviewID": "UR11267076", "Content": "Chosen after looking at tripadvisor and not disappointed.
