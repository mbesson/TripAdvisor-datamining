{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not a great place The location is very good, as it is a short walking distance to Ritan Park and Silk Alley. It's also within close taxi distance to some tourist spots.However, the service was not very good. The room was smelly and there was no hot water. The phone did not work, so we could not use it to call the reception desk nor housekeeping. When we complained, all we got was an insincere apology and no attempt to fix the problems (we had to use our cellphones to call reception). In addition, when the hot water kettle broke down, we asked the housekeeping people to fix it, and I guess they tried, but we wouldn't know because the kettle never made it back. Usually service apartments have cups, plates and some basic cutlery for use, but there wasn't anything in this kitchen.You also have to pay for internet usage, which is a little crazy considering that even the cheapest hotels (195RMB/night) in Beijing offer free service. It's not worth the money. You can get an equally good hotel room at a cheaper rate.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR119431582", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "livininChine"}, {"Content": "Very satisfied Extremely happy with my stay here. The location is great and the apartment was clean and modern.
