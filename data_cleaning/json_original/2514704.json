After finding Hotel East Houston, took a chance on it and I'm so happy I did. First off the location is cool. The Lower East side had a lot of interesting restaurants and bars all close to the hotel. And there is a subway station right around the corner, which I can't stress enough how awesome that is! The hotel is situated right in the middle of a lot of fun neighborhoods... LES, The East Village, Noho, are all within walking distance. The room itself was pretty cool, modern, clean and comfortable. It is a bit smaller, but was perfectly fine for my husband and me. Finally the rooftop terrace was beautiful, nice views of the skyline!

When we selected a hotel we wanted one that was close to Soho but also budget friendly. We found queen rooms at Hotel East Houston for $180. An incredible value for that area and quality of hotel. I actually was a bit hesitant as I thought it was too good to true as other similar hotels in the area were far more expensive. But when we walked in we were pleasantly surprised. The lobby is very modern and the staff were friendly and professional. We arrived around 11am and they said to come back at 3pm as the rooms weren\u2019t ready yet. They stored our luggage and we stepped out for brunch and came back at 1:30pm to use the free hotel wifi and they told us our rooms were ready early. Our suitcases were actually already in our rooms which was nice. I was very pleased when I walked into my room. Like the lobby it was very modern and clean. Everything looked like it was on the new side and well maintained. The bathroom had Bvlgari toiletries, and there was a complimentary bottle of water in the room. As well in the closet were slippers which was a a nice touch. As I expect all budget New York hotels it was on the small side but it was all the space that I needed. I was staying on my own in the room but if my husband was with me I think it would have been fine in terms of space. One odd thing was that the bathroom had a frosted glass wall that faced the room. So you can see people\u2019s outline when they are in there. Even for couples I think this level of nonprivacy would be awkward. The only other negative about the room was the noise. I had requested for us to have rooms on a upper level facing the back. They put us on the 3rd floor. My friend had a room that faced the side street and she said the noise wasn\u2019t that bad. But my room faced East Houston and it was very loud with traffic, sirens and honking at all hours of the night. I always travel with ear plugs so it wasn\u2019t an issue for me. But for light sleepers or those that didn\u2019t think ahead to bring ear plugs it would annoying. As well when people are talking in the hallway you can hear everything they say. Gladly people didn't loiter in the hallway but still a little annoying. When we checked in they told us breakfast was included that I actually forgot about. I don\u2019t know if breakfast is typically included in New York hotels but a nice bonus. It is served in the basement. In terms of the d\u00e9cor of this room they really should try to improve it. The lighting and breakfast display is depressive. It reminded me of being in a bus stop or hospital waiting room. But the breakfast offerings are actually nice. There is fresh coffee, orange juice and lots of teas. Though one gripe is that they have little coffee mate creamer packages instead of real cream. There are bagels, cream cheese, yogurt, granola bars, cheese, bananas, oranges, etc. I had the croissants and jam which are actually decent. There is a water cooler in the basement as well where I filled up my water bottle daily. For the value I would definitely stay at this hotel again. Particularly for a shopping trip it is in a great location. Some great restaurants in walking distance are Clinton St. Bakery for brunch, Ippudo for amazing japanese and ramen. A little further away is La Esquina for the best fish tacos, and Tertulia for delicious spanish tapas.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Jose, California", "Title": "\u201cMiscommunication\u201d", "Author": "marvylous", "ReviewID": "UR125657561", "Content": "We have always stayed in the UWS whenever visiting NY and this time around we thought we'd stay in the East Village/SoHo. After looking for hotels left and right, we settled for HEH because of the reviews its gotten, and the price (of course) couldn't be beat! It was easy to expect what was already mentioned in the reviews - smaller rooms, loud street noise, excellent customer service, etc. - but our experience, unfortunately, was not expected. We booked a King room and noted in the \"Preference\" area in the booking screen that we would like a high floor and away from the \"noisy\" East Houston St. (requests that were made based on the reviews I read here.) We arrived in the early morning and left our bags at the hotel before coming back that afternoon to check in. When we returned about 6 hours later, we were given a high floor room (603) and realized as soon as we walked in, that the bed was a Queen (or was it a full?) Either way, it wasn't the room we had paid for and we quickly called the front desk. We were told that because I had stated \"high floor\" in the preference section, they thought that we had preferred that over the King bed - which, by the way, they only have on the first 3 floors. But we *paid* for a King size room! How is that even logical!? If there's a price difference between the 2, I would think that they would ask before giving us a room we didn't book. And we were there early in the morning before we can go to the room...they could have asked us then! Bottom line, they weren't able to move us as no other King rooms were available. They refunded us the difference and a bottle of champagne was sent to our room with apologies. The noise level did very little to help the situation....and on the day of check-out, I did not appreciate the call at 10:30 (as we were walking out) to remind us that check-out was at 11:00. Of all the hotels I've stayed at, I have never been reminded to leave... Though the price was right at this hotel, it's not a place we will return to.

This was a great place to stay for someone originally from NYC and knows the Lower East Side very well. You're close to a couple of subway stops. There's the 2nd Avenue stop (F train) around the corner and then 3 other stations where the N/R, 4/6, and the B/D/M/F trains stop. The restaurants and bars selection in the neighbourhood can be overwhelming, but there is no shortage of choice. Among a two-block radius: a great Kosher deli (Russ & Daughters for farmers cheese), the Sunset Cinema (more of an upmarket repertory that shows indie films), Economy Candy (candy by the pound for under $3), and so on. Room: I was one person staying in a standard room. There was a good promotion so the rate was very affordable---under $150/night plus breakfast. The room is not surprisingly tiny. Barely any space for a large suitcase, and the closet is extremely small. But you're not here to luxuriate in the room. I did heed some of the advice and requested a quiet room so was overlooking the Eldridge Road side. It was quieter than being on East Houston, but you could still hear the bass thumping from the stereo of a nearby bar until 2am. The bathroom is likewise small, but there's great water pressure. Toiletries are a bit minimalist, too: there is only one bar of fancy smelling soap (Bvlgari) and they don't restock every day so you may want to pack extras. Breakfast: was part of the room rate and served in the basement. A narrow selection of croissants, danish, and bagels with jams/butters. Plenty of OJ, coffee, tea, milk. Also cereal, yoghurt, and fruit. But it's all pretty good, enough to get you started. Wi-Fi: this was a major pain. For some reason, it wasn't working properly in the room.

Excellent location, a short stroll away from the 2nd Ave subway station and a great bar, The National Underground a door or so away - I honestly never imagined I could get a hotel of this quality for the price I paid, with the location, the breakfast and the roof terrace. Not to mention the staff were so helpful - there was a mix up with my pick up time and so after they had already stored my bag I had to ask them to store it again for another 2 hours before I could be picked up - they didn't complain and I didn't notice until the second time that the gentleman who brought my bag to me was the Hotel Manager, who took the time to speak and ask me about my stay. The rooms were excellent, the only thing was I felt the beds could be a little more comfy, it was a quite thin, soft mattress on a hard base - whereas the Gem was a lot more comfortable, however I would choose the Hotel East Houston over the Gem for all the added bonuses. Other than more comfy beds, a room safe would be a good addition and a drinks machine (coke etc...) for after hours, other than the water available in the basement.

There's also a rooftop patio where you can enjoy great views and bring back food or drink to enjoy. AND its affordable, especially for NYC... If you're going to New York and plan to stay in the hotel room the entire time then maybe you want to find somewhere with larger rooms (good luck?) but I find this hotel to be perfect in every way.

We wanted to stay in the Lower East side so our pool of hotels to choose from I guess was limited. We decided to book this hotel for 5 nights based on reviews, the hotel website and location. We stayed for 2 nights and ended up moving to Hotel Rivington around the corner. I guess the main problem was that we were into the last week of a 3 week trip around Canada and had stayed in some lovely hotels and maybe were quite spoilt. The main issue is the size of the rooms. We booked a room with 2 single beds and I believe these rooms are slightly bigger then the double rooms however they are still really, really small. Also, the rooms are quite dark and lack any real style. I had looked at the hotel website and was aware that the twin rooms had a brown/cream decor but they really are quite dull. I noticed that all rooms on this particular floor were the same regardless of bedding type. I looked at a room with a double bed that was being cleaned and it was similar but even smaller. I assume other floors have rooms with brighter decors per the hotel website. The room was very clean as was the bathroom so if you just want a bed to sleep in and don't care about decor then it is more than adequate. I was not desperate to leave but just knew that The Hotel Rivington was in a similar position, had offered me a slightly cheaper rate, rooms would be bigger and decor more stylish. The major plus of Hotel East Houston is the location if you are interested in the lower east side and the rooftop. We really enjoyed taking our breakfast up to the rooftop on trays provided and eating in front of the New York skyline. It is also within walking distance of NoLita (loved Elizabeth Street) and Soho etc... When we moved to Hotel Rivington, we were a lot happier. The room was almost twice the size, very funky in decor, had a small lounge area with couch and coffee table, a whole wall of wardrobes, automated blinds that you opened from your bed which provided a nice view of the New York skyline, a great bathroom which was grey and silver with double shower and japanese tub and every night there was a turndown service with a different type of sweet example brownies. Although the room rate did not include breakfast like Hotel East Houston, it was $10 cheaper. Hotel East Houston was just not right for us. It is not a bad hotel by any means and I probably would have stayed the whole 5 nights if I was not aware of The Rivington.", "Date": "July 13, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGood location and value for NY\u201d", "Author": "Sharkey", "ReviewID": "UR68839272", "Content": "This is on the Lower East Side.

The staff were nice except the manager (explained below). My husband and I stayed here for 7 nights for business and a bit of a holiday. The location is great, Soho is a few minutes walk away and the lower east side (even though very trendy) still holds onto a bit of the old school diamond in the rough New York. Pre-warning, this bit maybe a bit boring but I like to note any relevant experiences but if you want the quick breakdown, skip this and see the list below. - The manager that we met on our last day unfortunately soured our stay. He was annoyed that one of the receptionists had allowed us to store our luggage (I admit that we had quite a bit of luggage but who doesn't when you go shopping in New York!) without notifying us of charges. The storage area was practically empty but he did not care, he was a \"by the book\" kind of guy, which is fair enough but we were not told of any charges for storing our luggage. In fact, it was offered to us as the receptionist saw that we had a few bags and knew that our room was small. Anyway, long story short we did tell the manager this when he slightly aggressively told us that we had to pay for the storage. We said that had we been told of the charges, we would have paid them and maybe crammed some of the luggage in our room but as such we had not been notified. He then became a tad annoyed and asked us who the member of staff was that had not informed us of the charges. We were not going to get into naming people as he seemed like a bit of an idiot, repeatedly saying how it was common sense that we would pay. I informed him that we had been traveling to New York for the last 10+ years and had never been charged a storage fee. This is obviously not a reason not to stay here but I just wanted to include it just so that you know that storage charges are in place and on this occasion the manager was a bit of a tool. This unfortunately tainted the stay as the manager's attitude was rude and New York has so many more hotels to offer. Positives Great location Lots of good restaurants nearby Reception and cleaning staff friendly Basic offering of morning bagels and coffee etc., in the basement saves on money on days you do not want to splurge on breakfast Pulino's restaurant a few steps away - their breakfast pizza is great Nice roof terrace with views Negatives (only 2 but enough for us not to return) -Manager got a bit nasty (see paragraph above) -Teeny tiny rooms (corner rooms may be bigger so ask for these) we comfortably fit 1 piece of luggage at the end of the bed and slid another between the side of the bed and wall. WIFI was annoying and dropped quite a bit Misc bits but someone might be interested: -Bvlgari shampoo/gel etc., is not as impressive as it sounds - it seemed like standard hotel chemical smelling stuff with a fancy name so you may want to bring your own shampoo etc -Bathroom was decent, it did not have the cringe factor -Hair dryer - good", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cNice stay in an affordable hotel\u201d", "Author": "wundrwomynn", "ReviewID": "UR63164956", "Content": "We booked a queen room for $199 a night over the weekend.

Then we discovered they had totally messed up our booking - these things happen, but it was the way they dealt with it that left us sad and still angry. We'd reserved 4 nights at approx \u00a3240 per night - pretty expensive - for a superior queen room. When we arrived they said we had to move to a twin room the next night and another the following night, and didn't understand why that would not be ideal for a couple on a romantic break, the only other option was a tiny double directly off the ground floor lobby with no window where we would again have to move around the hotel. There would be no discount they said! Fine we said, as you cannot fulfil our aggreement, we'll find somewhere else tomorrow and just stay tonight. We had to argue in reception for almost an hour to get them to agree to this and not charge us for 2 nights stay, we actually were charged for 2 nights, and had to deal with the manager for another hour to get the refund the next day. The rooms are teeny tiny, look tired, scuffed and scratched floors, walls and furniture, old toothpaste splattered up the bathroom wall, and very very loud air con. Having glass bathroom walls is ridiculous for sharers - if someone needs the bathroom in the night the light wakes the other person up! TV didn't work and we really did not want to have to spend more of our short holiday speaking with staff there to try and get it sorted [it probably wasn't broken but on the wrong setting - control didn't work with it]. Internet free, but very very slow. Breakfast is served in the basement and would be fine for a budget hotel or hostel, but seriously embarrassing for a so-called boutique hotel. cheap flimsy tiny tables and school chairs. the actual food and drink was fine, but at the price we were paying, very disappointing. So we went around the corner, into the reception of a proper boutique hotel - a famous trendy chain - and were welcomed so nicely, and given a beautiful huge room with floor to ceiling windows on 2 walls AT HALF THE PRICE per night. Only reason I am not naming is because I went back to NY recently and it was fully booked and I want to stay again soon! Sorry. This is the first time I have ever had to write a bad review of anything online, and I am still angry at the huge waste of money.

The room was small (it's NY!), but clean, modern, and comfortable. I have to warn you that the bathrooms in the rooms are not for people who may be shy - there's a textured glass wall separating the restroom from the rest of the room. I'm not shy, so it didn't both me or my fiance, but it's something that should be known. Loved the Bulgari bath products! Breakfast was fresh and delicious with pastries from Balthazar bakery and gourmet coffee. The staff kept our luggage again while we toured the city on the day of check out. They even allowed us to use the hotel's refrigerator to store left-overs from dinner. And the rooftop deck was a fabulous place to enjoy breakfast or wine in the evening. Overall it was a great experience and we will be staying there again!

We both used to live in NY, so we wanted to stay at a place as far away from tourist-y areas as possible, yet still be near good restaurants, bars, and walking distance to everything. This hotel is a stone's throw from Soho, Little Italy, and the East and West Village. We saved so much money not using taxis, and walking instead! WholeFoods is a couple blocks away so we could always run out and pick up anything we needed. The staff was super friendly and very accommodating. We weren't used to this kind of friendliness from New Yorkers! I have to agree with most of the other reviewers, and should warn that the rooms are on the small side. But, for the price, I expected as much. Still, it's clean, stylish, and the bed is really comfortable (I like a firm mattress). The windows are sound-proofed, so even at night when things are bustling, we got a good night's rest. The roof-top deck has great views of the city...perfect for snapping some pictures. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone on a budget who wants to experience downtown NY at its best. People that are used to hotel suites with spas, room service, and lounging around in their hotel rooms wouldn't like it much. I, on the other hand, love this hotel!", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cI'd Check Back In\u201d", "Author": "katemc39", "ReviewID": "UR31956218", "Content": "Happy to have gotten lucky with this hotel.

Breakfast was fabulous (really european with french cheeses and pastries from Balthazars). Internet was via terminals in the breakfast nook, or WIFI. However, the room was (and i admit, i read it) extremely small, even though we asked for a corner room (they are bigger). We were with 2. There is no place to put the suitcase, no place to hang anything. no shelf in the bathroom. If you get out of bed, you have to shuffle/squeeze against the wall to get around the bed.

Found this hotel through Expedia, but ended up booking directly through the hotel (since it was the same price - $129 USD / night - and allowed us to cancel right up to 48 hours before our stay - unlike Expedia). Hotel has a true boutique vibe... nicely designed, clean, modern. Terrace on the 7th floor as a great view towards uptown (be sure to check it out at night). Location is great - right in SoHo, close to some cool shops & restaurants and 4 blocks from Broadway. A 15-20 minute walk to Greenwich, Tribeca, Lower East Side, ChinaTown, etc... even the Financial District is walkable. Half a block from the F & V subway lines to take you uptown. Like some of the other reviews mention, the rooms are a bit small, but after a day in Manhattan, you don't need much more... just a comfortable bed (which they do have). Only concern for some may be the semi-transparent wall between bathroom and bedroom - not a problem if you're close with the person you're staying with. The free breakfast should not be overlooked - much more than just a coffee and croissant. They had cereal, fresh fruit, pastries & bagels, yogurt, cheese plate, fruit juices, coffee - more than enough to get you started for a day of sightseeing. Parking can be a challenge in New York - there are parking garages available for about $30/day... we were lucky enough to find a spot on a side street about 2 blocks away from the hotel that let us leave our car from Friday morning to Sunday afternoon. Didn't cost a thing, and we didn't have to move it once. So if you drive, spend a bit of time searching before giving into the pay garages. Staff was very friendly and check-in/out was hassle free.

The Hotel is very discreet and our Taxi person also had a hard time locating it. The check in was quick and smooth.

We had a built in desk, small closet with several shelves and a fireplace. We stored one suitcase on a stand in the entryway and the other suitcase under the bed. The bed was nice (like my swedish mattress at home) with at least 300 thread count linens. The shower was a decent size with great water pressure. The best part of this hotel is the downtown location. We walked though the LES, NOLITA, SOHO, Battery Park, Gramercy, Wall Street, East Village and China Town. When we had to go to midtown to meet my cousin at the Four Seasons it was only a 10 minutes cab ride. Ditto for the two performances (Spamalot and Boeing Boeing).

A small shallow cupboard near the door which at best would hold your coat and no drawers at all. You really do have to live out of your suitacase the whole time.
