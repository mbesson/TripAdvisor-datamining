The room and ensuite shower room were both of a good size, but don't expect the acres of space in the chain hotels. This is an entirely different experience and the building is typical of those in the old town (Sultanamet area) The photos on the hotel website give an accurate flavour of the rooms and the standard of fittings is very good - comfortable bed, excellent shower, double-glazed windows. The breakfast served on the roof terrace was a generous buffet with local cheeses, olives and homemade fried pastries as well as the usual muesli, fruit etc. When they found out that I was vegetarian, Hamid asked his wife to make pastries for me with only cheese and leek, leaving out the usual salami.

I only saw our room (41) - it was nicely furnished, impeccably clean, not large, but adequate. It was very quiet for sleeping.

The car pick up from the airport was very smooth. We saw a sign with our name as soon as we came through the doors and were taken to our car immediately which was waiting for us a short walk away. On arrival, we were very warmly greeted by Vefa (I think) and given all the relevant information regarding our stay before being taken to our room. We are wine fans and often travel with our own wine and Champagne. The hotel has a great rooftop terrace with views across the city, the Bosphorus and the top of the Blue Mosque, where we could sit and chill with a bottle every evening before going out for dinner. The hotel is perfectly happy for you to bring your own drinks and will provide you with glasses, corkscrew and snacks. One night we saw a couple on the terrace who had got a takeaway from somewhere, and was having a full private dinner by themselves. The hotel is a short walk away from all the main sights and the Grand Bazaar which we spent a lot of time and money at! It is also close to the restaurant street on which we ate every night. It was great to be able to finish a bottle on the rooftop of the hotel, walk to the restaurant within a few minutes and have our meal, then walk back to the hotel after another bottle or two! The breakfast is great quality - everything is fresh and delicious. Every morning there were 2 different kinds of fresh fruit juice, freshly baked items, at least a couple of cooked dishes, a daily changing sweet desert (for example, a cake baked by the owner himself), eggs, a selection of fresh fruits and vegetables, dried fruits, cheeses, olives, breads and cereals. The variety is huge and they make sure that every day they change at least a few things so that you don't get bored. The owner Hamit was at breakfast every morning to give us advice on what to do that day and urge us to eat more. It was like staying at a friend's home, and I loved the cozy friendly atmosphere. Fatih was also great at giving us advice about the city and answering any questions we had - his English is excellent and he is mega friendly (and cute). The cleanliness of all parts of the hotel and our room was outstanding. I am a clean freak to the point of being neurotic, so this coming from me is truly significant. The room is nicely appointed, the bathroom is modern, new and well equipped. There are coffee and tea in the room, a fridge and LCD TV and a powerful aircon. Despite not being on a high floor, we did not have any problems with noise. Basically, there is nothing to fault. On our final day, our car to the airport was 13.30, an hour and a half after the official check out time. We had to vacate our room because the next guest was arriving at noon, but the hotel moved our bags to the room on the G/F and let us use that room until the time we left. We really appreciated that gesture.

I followed up with the staff via email to discuss the airport transfers and found their communication to be quick and clear. We were met at the airport by a driver assigned by Osmanhan. Upon arrival at Osmanhan, we were greeted warmly by Fatih. He assisted us through the check-in and took us to our room. We stayed at other locations in Turkey over the following two weeks, so I can say with confidence that the room we had at Osmanhan was a great size for two people. We had plenty of room for our luggage and in the bathroom. Throughout our stay, we would ask Fatih for recommendations for local fare or less \"touristic traps\" and he would always send us to a great find. In fact, after we would go and read the reviews of the restaurants later, they were glowing as well, so Fatih knows his recommendations well. Mehmet was the primary person we saw during our rooftop terrace breakfast and he was very friendly. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. The street noise is comparable to other hotels in the area but the one complaint we had was on one night, being that the front desk was directly below our room, we heard some noise until late into the evening.

Whether you need some toast and tea because you are sick, or you need directions or tips they will help. The breakfast was good and diverse. It is served at the topmost floor where you can also enjoy a view of the Bosphorus. The room was large enough, clean initially and maintained perfectly clean every day. It had a fridge, tv, internet, everything we needed. The location was good, minutes of several important attractions: Aya Sophia, Blue Mosque, Topkapi palace, basilica cistern. How do you get to it from the airport by public transportation? Well, it is not hard at all. I arrived at the Sabiha G\u00c3\u00b6k\u00c3\u00a7en airport on the Asian side. I took a Havas bus (very comfortable) to Taksim square. Then, the funicular to Kabatas and then the light rail to the Sultanahmet station (the Cankurtaran station is closer but you need to make one more change to get to it). From the Sultanahmet station there is a 5-10 minute walk. You should print the directions in advance, there are many hotels in the area. It is not obvious which way to go. For a good map on public transportation in Istanbul search for \"public transport in Istanbul\" on Wikipedia. If you have very large/heavy luggage then you may consider a more direct means of transportation. The 5-10 minute walk from Sultanahmet to the hotel is partly on cobblestones and on descending terrain. Not the easiest thing to do with large luggage. There are different options to get from the hotel to the airports too. To get to the large airport (Ataturk airport) we took a shared van. The hotel staff arranged everything for us. It was a very nice place to stay at. I would happily return. Many thanks to Fatih at the reception desk for the help. Communicating in English with him was so easy.

I'm a heavy sleeper but was woken up twice during my five day stay by smokers from the hostel next door. It's no big deal for me but might be a problem for others.

Everyone there was very friendly especially Fatih. He always had a patient answer to every question I asked...and I know I asked a lot of stupid questions.

The hotel is in a quiet side street, which is one turn away from the entry to the Arasta market, which is next to the blue mosque, the heart of the Sultanahment district of Istanbul. One turn from the hotel and you're smack in the middle of the market, the blue mosque, aya sofiya, numerous eating joints, the tram station and more or less everything one could need. We took a ground floor double room since it was the only one available when i booked but found no issues with the rooms, which were superbly done, had comfortable beds, a TV and a mini bar. The bathroom was also good with a superb rain shower cubicle. Hardly any noise from the reception filtered in at any time. Roadside noise was also limited. The breakfast was a small affair but high on quality and we got the usual array of cheeses, breads, eggs and fresh fruits and veggies, enough to keep you going. They served it on the lovely terrace which had wonderful views of the Sea of marmara and the blue mosque. There isnt a bar or all day cafe which is slightly limiting but understandable considering its a small hotel. What you do get is Mehmet (a good natured kid) running up the kitchen and preparing coffee or tea for you whenever you decide to hike (No lifts here) to the terrace during the day. Fatih, the manager was wonderful and helped us book an evening tour with a local which was unlike anything we ever did. Total insight into the life of a person in Istanbul. He also organized other tours like the Bosporous Cruise and helped with innumerable direction guidelines to Taksim Square and the shopping malls. All in all, the young staff namely, Fatih (the manager), Mehmet, Aslan (the 2 youngsters serving breakfast) and Aslan's brother (the night shift manager) were there whenever we needed them.

Two things should be noted to prepare potential future travelers: the single circular staircase leading to every room, and the roof terrace, is a tight spiral with only the wall on one side and a metal artsy rail on the other, but too far apart to hold both at once. And, the dense hotel and restaurant/bar location is great most of the time, but not great when asleep and guests of the neighboring hostel decide to stand outside and smoke and chat/yell/sing into the wee hours.

We had a wonderful time and felt very welcome at this hotel. All the staff paid attention to detail and went out of their way to make sure we and our baby were comfortable, to the extent that the owner even offered to let us borrow his daughter's bath tub to bathe our baby. We ended up showering her, but it was a very nice gesture nonetheless. The property itself is converted from a house, and is small and narrow and built up on several stories. The rooms are well appointed, clean, and decorated traditionally. There is no elevator and the stairs spiral up, with 2 rooms on each floor. On the top floor is the beautiful rooftop terrace where the excellent breakfast is served. We have very fond memories of enjoying leisurely breakfasts on that terrace, munching on the delicious spread and chatting with Mustafa, the co-owner. The breakfast spread usually included simit (Turkish bagel-like pastry with sesame seeds), breads, cheese, tomato, cucumber, eggs, fruits, yogurt, and a delicious rose petal jam. There were many highlights of our stay at Osmanhan - one of them happened about 5 days into our stay. We had checked out of the hotel after breakfast to go and spend 4 nights visiting Selcuk, Ephesus, and Cesme before returning to Istanbul for another 2 nights at Osmanhan. Although there were many taxis outside the hotel, Mustafa insisted on calling a taxi for us from a reputable taxi company, which he said was more reliable than the taxis outside. We loaded up our luggage and baby and went off to the airport for our domestic flight. An hour later when we landed in Izmir I realized that my cell phone was missing, and deduced that it must have fallen out in the trunk of the taxi. We called Osmanhan Hotel and explained the situation to Fatih at the front desk. Fatih made a couple of quick calls and located my phone, then called us back and told us he would hold on to it until we returned to Istanbul, and told us to relax and enjoy our time on the coast. Imagine how happy I was to find my phone waiting for me in the hotel safe when we came back to Osmanhan 4 days later! :) Without Mustafa calling for a taxi for us, and without Fatih working with the taxi company to track down my phone, it definitely would have been lost that day. Osmanhan's Sultanahmet location is great - within short walking distance to most of the old town's historic sights, as well as the Sultanahmet tram stop, which provides easy access to other parts of the city. The whole Sultanahmet district is pretty touristy, but it's also quaint and convenient. We have such fond memories of Osmanhan hotel and Istanbul... watching the sun set over the minarets of the Blue Mosque, rambling over the cobblestones back to the hotel after busy days of exploring, the warmth of the Turks as they played with our baby... we can't wait to return and visit again one day!", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo, Norway", "Title": "\u201cexcellent and wonderful\u201d", "Author": "baldricing", "ReviewID": "UR114930345", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights,found this hotel on TA.,very nice hotel,clean,comfortable,The hotel itself is beautiful.

The other was \"Cooking Alaturk\", where I also did a very enjoyable cooking class that finished with the participants eating the delicious four couse meal together.

Four at the beginning of my trip, and one at the end. It was a perfect choice. First of all, Fatih, who works the front desk is exceptionally sweet and helpful. His English was very good (English is the only language I speak fluently); we communicated via e mail and I called once. Every question was answered with kindness and patience. The rooms are very clean, nicely decorated, and cozy; and I think I remember that the beds were comfortable. I would have liked a little more surface space in the room and bathroom, but, really, I was hardly in my room so it wasn't a big deal. The food at the hotel is standard to many hotels; it was good and enough, and the two young women working the kitchen friendly and helpful. The rooftop view isn't much, but again, I didn't spend much time at the hotel and didn't care. The location is good. I could walk everywhere, and did. My first full day in Istanbul I asked Fatih if he knew someone who would show me around for about an hour, get me acclimated. A man who was standing next to me at that moment said he would take me around. He was Hamit, the owner! He took me to a museum and acted as a private tour guide, took me to a top rated (by Lonely Planet) a bit off the beaten track restaurant, and of course, to his carpet shop where I had several cups of tea. Hamit may be unusual in that he didn't push me to buy, nor does he send people out to hussle you into his shop. At the end of my Turkey travel I was happy to come back for one night before catching a morning flight. It felt like coming \"home.\" The only downside to this charming hotel and staff is the noise from the street and late nighters who were probably hostelers. But, my earplugs mostly took care of that. I wonder how many areas of the Sultanahmet area are noisy, as it is a bustling city. Istanbul is a fantastic; the people lovely. My only regret is not having spent more than five days in Istanbul.

We loved it - beautiful rooms, very well maintained, friendly and helpful staff, lovely breakfasts from the rooftop. If we travel to Istanbul again this will be our first choice. We booked our room just a day before we arrived in Istanbul (we didn't know in advance when we would arrive). We were offered a triple room at the price of a standard double, so we got a very good deal. The room was excellent - very clean and comfortable, air conditioning, nice bathroom with a very good shower. The bed was nice and firm and we slept VERY well. Even if we'd had the double room (rather than the triple at no extra charge) I think we would have felt just as comfortable. The hotel is situated in the heart of the historic part of Istanbul, a few minutes walk from Agia Sofia, the Blue Mosque and Topkapi palace. It's on a quiet backstreet corner, just 50 metres or so from a busier road full of restaurants and small shops. Although this street is fairly lively in the evenings, there is very little noise or traffic on the street where the hotel is. To get to the metro is about 5 minutes walk (near Agia Sofia), and you can also walk to a station on the older train line near the coast in a few minutes. In terms of location, it is very well placed. All the staff are extremely friendly, speak good or excellent English, and can advise on places to go to eat or to visit. Breakfast is served on the rooftop terrace, with views towards the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorus. You can choose from a buffet which offers delicious fresh bread and rolls, cheeses, jams, fresh fruit, cucumber, tomato, fruit juices, yoghurt, eggs, tea/coffee and more. It's genuinely hard to think of anything much at the hotel that was lacking or needed improving. Having a small safe in the room might be a useful addition, and there was only one parasol on the rooftop terrace to give some shade (it can be hot even at 9am). Apart from those minor details, everything you need is there for you. I think the reason for success of this hotel is that it is small (8 rooms), family run, and well maintained by a small team of excellent, friendly staff, so you are very well looked after.

Our room No. 22, overlooks the cobbled streets. It was small but cosy and exceptionally cosy! Outside the hotel during the day yellow taxis park for passengers. But come night time, all is silent and peaceful. We love the bed having stayed in other 4 5 star hotels theirs was the best bed we have slept in. The mattress was firm and supports our backs and the feather quilt is warm and so comforting. Hot water is instant and the water pressure is strong. Choosing accommodation in Istanbul is not easy. There's a wide variety of them, but we decided we wanted the experience of staying in the historical area in Sultanahmet, away from the chain hotels.From the beginning our emails were answered promptly by Fatih and Ahmet. We arrived early before 8.00 a.m. and Ahmet was at the reception to greet us. We were given breakfast. at the terrace. While waiting for our room to be ready we went for a walk around the Sultanhmet area even up to Sultanahmet square. Later we met Fatih and my wife even guessed his age correctly. Ahmet and Fatih were so helpful to us throughout our stay. Fatih helped to carry our luggage on arrival and departure. Ahmet was very kind to lend his English Quranic translation and helped to purchase Turkish perfumes for us. Leyla prepares breakfast and later cleans all the rooms. She is a gem. We visited the owner's carpet shop; Motif Collection. Hamit is passionate about his work and we learned a lot about Turkish carpets and Kilims. We brought a few souvenirs from his shop. Thank you Hamit for also bringing us shopping for Kilim leather bags. There is a hidden treasure in Osmanhan and we found this in the light of Mustafa, the elder brother of Hamit. They say that breakfast is the most important meal of the day and this is so true for us. Mustafa was always there at breakfast and we would wait eagerly for him to bring the Simit. Sometimes his wife would bake cakes which were absolutely delicious and not too sweet. He prepares our favourite Menemen (Turkish scramble eggs). It was so wonderful to see him in the morning. Leyla was also there to help him and later we got to know Haiyyat. We stayed a total of 9 nights and was really sad when we had to leave to another hotel. We had booked a taxi for the transfer but instead Mustafa sent us in his own car braving the traffic jam with our heavy luggage. We will never forget this kind and sincere deed. Thank you so much Mustafa! 2 days we came back to get the perfumes from Ahmet and it really felt like a homecoming, walking the cobbled streets and walking up the steep spiral staircase. The first thing that caught our attention was the familiar smell of breakfast . The breakfast in Osmanhan is delicious! We love the Simit. Oh the smell of the Simit, soft on the inside with a crunch on the outside. Certainly the best Simit comes from Osmanhan 's breakfast table For us the breakfast at Osmanhan was not just a meal, it was momentous event where we spent an hour in the terrace in the morning. If you want to experience Turkish hospitality this is where you want to stay. From the reception desk to the breakfast terrace everything is done with sincerity and warmth.

At b/fast (or before) Layla made us coffee or tea whenever we cared for one and it was allways with a smile. The truth is the staff made this hotel...... What I had a problem with was how you entered the building and that was reception, you then went up a spirral staircase and there was 2 rooms on each floor, off the staircase (no landings) on the top floor is the b/fast room and small balcony for 2 tables. There is also a terrace ontop of the b/fast room with one table for 2. This I feel should be made into an area with soft furnishings like the hotel behind, where you can sit in the sun and enjoy a book or a drink. Our room was clean, spacious and the beds very comfortable, the only downside of the room was the taxi rank outside and because of the room positions on each floor, I think they will all have the same noise problems. (see photo) I would recommend this hotel for families with little children because of the stairs, as you can imagine in a spirral staircase, each step is normal size on the outside but very thin on the inside.

Long Review Istanbul is a city filled with historical gems such as Aya Sofya (the Basilica of Hagia Sophia), the Blue Mosque, Galata Tower, the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Bazaar, Topkapi Palace, and the Underground Cistern.

Though new and tiny \u00e2\u20ac\u201c just 8 rooms -- the Osmanhan Hotel is affordable (even more so considering the sumptuous Turkish breakfast included), provides impeccable service, has beautifully renovated rooms, and is that perfectly located in the Sultanamet district (5-20 minutes from everything).

Mustafa, Fatih, Ahmet, and others were most gracious to us whether offering suggestions on where to go, how to say \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Turkish, filling our water bottles, or talking about their families. On several occasions, Mustafa, the owner, brought homemade pastries from his wife to add to the breakfast feast, which included breads, cheeses, eggs, fruits, meats, salads, and Turkish coffee, tea, and yogurt. Fatih was staffing the front desk the most when we were leaving or the returning to the hotel, so we got to know him the best. He is very knowledgeable and helpful. Istanbul is a friendly city, and is easy to get around, whether by walking, taking the tram, or hopping a public ferry from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Europe\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Asia.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd All of the museums have signs in Turkish and English. The Osmanhan hotel is in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the city near almost all major attractions; you can take a long walk or take a tram to Taksim, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd part of the city. Whereas the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153old\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd city is lined with stores selling traditional goods such as rugs, souvenirs, et al, the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153new\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd city is ultra modern, where trendy stores sell the latest fashions. Be sure to visit the rug store run by Hamit Balkir, Mustafa\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s brother. We loved the tribal rugs and the stories they told, such as a rug that is sewn in two halves and joined by the wedding of the bride and groom. Istanbul is also a historically tolerant city. During the Inquisition, Turkey welcomed many Jews and Moors who were forced to leave Spain. The Official Turkish Website such as www.kulturturizm.gov.tr list many Churches, Mosques and Synagogues on their must see list. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to return to Istanbul.

Everything is very clean - the terrace, the rooms, the bathrooms, the stairs, the lobby, etc. The showers had good hot water and good pressure. The staff will take care of your laundry for you - send it out and bring it back. There is free wireless throughout the hotel, which we really appreciated. The desk is staffed 24 hours/day. Mustafa and Hamit showed us their carpet shop; they are very knowledgeable about the history and restoration of traditional carpets from Cappadocia. It was fascinating to learn from them! Leyla is there providing wonderful, friendly service every morning at breakfast and also keeps everything immaculate every day! We had to leave at 3:30 AM in order to make our flight, and Ahmet and Fatih even packed us breakfasts for our early departures! We were surprised to learn that the hotel will be closed a few days in January for some remodeling and upgrading - it is already clean, modern, and efficient - so it should be even more spectacular soon! Without hesitation, I highly recommend the Osmanhan Hotel to anyone who is looking for a small, comfortable, clean, extremely well-run hotel in a perfect location in Istanbul. This is only the second review I have ever posted at tripadvisor - the other one (my first) was posted five years ago (Prague). I decided to post this review because Osmanhan is fantastic!

We tried to extend our stay however the hotel was full so we moved to another hotel after 4 days.

The views from the rooftoop at the Sea of Marmara were amazing, and the hotel is very conveniently located near Haghia Sofia, Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace. It is just located about a block away from the \"tourist\" part of Akbiyik Caddesi, which is the best of both worlds, as your stay is quiet (and you don't have to listen to all the ruckus up the street if you don't want; I would recommend trying other streets in Sultanahmet for more authentic restaurants). We arrived at the hotel from Ataturk Int'l Airport: our transport was arranged by Fatih and included in the hotel bill (25EUR). You can definitely find cheaper transportation alternatives from the airport, but you do save yourself the hassle of carrying luggage on the metro (the closest stop is a fair distance from the hotel if you're carrying anything). Also, bear in mind that you will receive a discount on your stay and all charges (the minibar is very reasonably priced, by the way) if you pay in cash.

My wife and I wholeheartedly, unreservedly recommend the Osmanhan Hotel. The hospitality we enjoyed there was as much a part of our experience of Istanbul as anything else. We had the best hotel experience of our lives. Fatih, Ibrahim, Leyla and Ahmet made sure our stay was as comfortable and pleasant as possible. And Hamit and Mustafa, the owners, were often around to bring us Turkish coffee and anything else we needed. The hotel is ideally located in Sultanahmet which is where you want to be. The Blue Mosque and Aya Sofya are just a short walk away and Topkapi is literally just around the corner. Just past Aya Sofya is the tram line that can take you to Taksim Square and Iskital Street (an area you definitely need to visit to see the real Istanbul) and almost every other place you'd like to go in Istanbul. Just a half block up the street beside the Osmanhan is a street lined with restaurants and bars so you won't have to walk very far for lunch and dinner. The Turquoise is especially good. One of their dishes is to cook meat (lamb, beef, or chicken) in a clay pot with vegetables. The pot is then broken open at the table with a metal rod. Delicious! A block away from the Osmanhan in the other direction is Balikci Sabahattin, said to be the best fish restaurant in Istanbul. It is not cheap but there can't be fresher fish on the planet. Delicious! Walking in that same direction for ten minutes you arrive at the Bosphorus where you can sit on benches and enjoy the panorama of Istanbul and gawk at the huge tankers that pass by. A vendor will probably pass by selling simit, Turkish sesame bagels. Our room was spotless, comfortable and welcoming. The bed was one of the most comfortable we've ever slept in. The bathroom was new, very modern, and again spotless with a great shower and a heated towel rack for winter months. The wireless Internet worked perfectly. And we had a control to set the air conditioning to the temperature we desired. Each day Leyla made sure we had everything we needed. When we needed an iron one quickly appeared. They also sent out our laundry to be washed. From the several hours of research I did on Istanbul I can safely say the Osmanhan is a great bargain, too. To alter an old saying, you get more than you paid for, much more. The breakfast buffet was packed with fresh fruit, cherry and orange juice, cereal and different pastries. One morning Mustafa's wife baked a cake with sweet and sour cherries and chocolate drizzled over the top. A real treat! And, of course, there was always great yogurt. The rooftop terrace where breakfast is served was described by my wife as a little bit of heaven. And it is. You have a panoramic view of the Bosphorus and a bird's eye view, literally, of the Blue Mosque. In the afternoon if you wanted a relaxing break you could sit on the terrace and enjoy the views and the street life below. Almost every evening we ended our day on the terrace enjoying the cool air, usually a breeze, and the tranquility. Perfect! We cannot praise the Osmanhan staff too much. Fatih was always there making sure we were comfortable and knew where we were going. He often got cabs for us and explained where we wanted to go. His intervention meant we got a fair price for our cab ride. He also gave us hints, made suggestions, and made reservations for shows and restaurants. He could not have been kinder, more professional, or more knowledgeable. Ibrahim made our breakfasts an ideal start to the day. I don't know how many cups of tea and coffee he brought us. It might be in the hundreds. And always with a smile. We miss the Osmanhan and Istanbul and are already planning on returning. Both are experiences not to be missed. Thanks.

It was a wonderful experience. We stayed in different hotels from Euro 45 to 120 in our two-week trip in Turkey. This is the one that provided us all-round satisfaction. Volcan and Hamit are attentive to every details to ensure that everything is right. They really treat the guests as friends. We changed our plan and arrived from Amarsa two days earlier than our booking in a weekend. As it was full house, they were care enough to make their greatest effort to find us a few options at different budget for our choice. While they were busy in making the enquiries for us, we were treated to have a free breakfast and then we were even driven to the hotel of our choice. This hotel has a Turkish outlook and recruits very good staff. All of them are sincere, friendly and helpful. Its inside is new and modern. It's cleaningness, VCD TV (signal of international channels not clear though), well-functioning air-conditioner, stable and strong water pressure, laptop computer for lending can compare with any 5-stars hotel. Every morning we ate our breakfast in the terrace with a view of the Marama Sea. The choice was not as many as the large hotels but I particularly liked the seasonal fruits (cherries, strawberries, water melons etc...) and homemade cake. Then, with the warm greetings and great smile of Fatih, we were off our road to Istanbul adventures. After a whole day sight-seeing, with its good location, we could return to our lovely room within a short time. We could then have a shower and quickly check emails in our air-conditioned room. Once, we were cool down, we brought our drinks and went upstairs again to the terrace to enjoy the sunset scene or if after dark watch the seagulls flying around the spotlighted minarets of Blue Mosque.

All extremely friendly and helpful they spared no effort to help us plan our days and our shopping and ...God bless them. They are trying their best to run this cosy, lovely hotel.

The bathrooms which are utterly important for me were really new and clean. the bes mattresses were so comfy,we had the best of sleep, with double-gazed small windows. I hope they keep up the good work and keep maintain the high standard. They even did not charge us for the lamp shade my sun broke!! I have some very minor suggestions however for the owner (just to help them keep Osmanhan as good as it is, because we will come back!!), which surely increases the already high standards of theis lovely hotel: The hardware generally might need some replacement with more sturdy types to minimize the need to repair them frequently, and to outlive the wear and tear associated with hotel rooms, such as the toilet seat covers, window handles and locking systems, thicker light bulbs!!, gas and water heating system, some fine tuning of TV channels, some extra safety rails and non-slip edges for the stairs, covering the staircase walls with wooden pannels to minimize the bruising to the walls and the need to repaint them, To add the turkish flair, some simit for the breakfast, some tea in traditional turkish narrow-waisted glass cups fro breakfast and may be some fresh orange juice at an aditional cost.

First of all there are people. Volcan and Hamit created and drive Osmanhan Hotel. Of course, they are special people and you feel it from first words and first view in Osmanhan Hotel, they hire well trained and as extremely polite as it posiible only in Byzsantium and Istanbul personnel. (And believe us you never foget Vlocan's cakes) The second subject is location, of courcse. We know Istanbul very well - we walked over all new and old streets - and when we up to the terrace of Osmanhan Hotel for breakfast or for our romantic evening with bottle of excelent Capadocia wine we see the Maramara, Golden Horn and Prince Ilands. If you open any book of Orhan Pamuk and up your eyes from pages to this view you feel like time is changed and you are in Istanbul world of greatest Turkish writer. Saddenly you hear a call of greengrocer from the street, you look down to small street wich cuts the area as many streets of old town and sensation of real Istanbul fill up you soul. You look up againg forward to the Maramara and Prince Ilands and you feel by each cell of your soul like something great old and beatiful shine beside you in sunset rays - it is Aya-Sofia.
