The pictures in the ad showed a very nice hotel, and they claim its a 4 star, so we paid $100 USD per night, As soon as we walked into our room we were horrified. The first thing was the smell. It reeked of some kind of cooking so bad, and they kept spraying air fresheners, which probably made it worse. It was also the dirtiest hotel I've ever stayed in. All the couches and chairs were stained and had things caked onto them, they were also extremely uncomfortable. They put clean sheets on the fold out couch and I still didn't want to sleep on it because the part where my head went was so dirty. The floors had visible splatter marks all over them, and were sticky, The cabinets were all super sticky, and literally had red sauce splattered all over them. The handles were super sticky. The bathrooms had no towels or toilet paper, and they smelled horrible and weren't cleaned. The roof is full of mold. Also, the internet, which costs $15 USD per night is sooooo slow. This place in my opinion is a dump. The only good thing is that there is allot of restaurants around, and its only 15-20 minutes from the airport and the Burj Khalifa.

The shower curtain, room curtains (there are lots of no smoking signs around the hotel but this rule is not enforced in rooms if anywhere) carpet, kitchen equipment were all in need of a good clean if not replacement.

We laughed every morning and fell back to sleep. The view - forget it and don't look outside. The location is safe and hotel is clean. Let's leave it at that. Nothing fancy, clean! :) Near an internet cafe', and not far from a CarreFour. There were several small markets, and a larger grocery market on main street (Spinney's Market), next to a coffee shop. There was a Lebonese restaurant near this market that was quite enjoyable. The Ramada Hotel had a nice cafe restaurant as well. Just approx. 8 blocks to the river, where you can catch the \"bumper\" boat ride across the river. Go do this on Thurs. or Friday night when its the busiest when all the boats are fighting to get to the dock as your boat fights to get away from the dock. HILLARIOUS! Pool upstairs is small, but secluded. The rooms were quiet and clean. Nothing to complain about. There is a cleaners across the street which is cheap and quick. Remember this is a CHEAP way to stay.

It exceeds all basic requirements, more than a 3 star hotel. Nothing was too much for the extremely friendly staff, and true to Dubai style, everything was dirt cheap, inside and outside of the hotel. The only thing we found remotely expensive but worth it was the water park, which was your typical theme park prices, in an amazing area. The beaches and the zoo ranged from 20p-\u00a31 per person. In a great area, although is some distance from the main tourist attractions, which isn't important as to be dropped off and picked up anywhere is about \u00a34, so we had our own personal chauffer most days for about \u00a34 a day! There is a very delicious pizzeria in the lobby, which you can ring directly and have delivered, and is about 50p for a 10 inch pizza! Unfortunately, most people don't, but we tipped very generously here, and it goes along way and you can see the gratitude from the underpaid staff. Next door to the supermarket, and surrounded by resturants. Although it is difficult to find alcohol in Dubai, we were about a 5 minute walk from the nearest bar, an english sports bar with english prices. Pool area was lovely with a lovely view from the rooftop pool., and rooms were comfortable, spotless and reasonably sized, with a lovely bathroom. The only negative to our holiday was that we stayed in the height of summer in Auguest, and the weather was, at times unbearable, but the rooms were air conditioned, as were most places. We were reccomended to travel during our winter to get the most out of the experience. We booked some lovely trips through our hotel, and the dubai creek cruise was a lovely evening.

The front desk staff is not very welcoming or friendly, almost as if it is a chore to serve you. Ramee Appts has a great location in BurDubai- worth the $120 AED per night, as its close to many things. There is a grocery store that is 24 hours just up the street and a mall not far from the grocery store. There are a few take out food places across the street, a pharmacy to the left and many indian food resturants near by. The room was spacious, huge bed and clean but with a few ants in the bathroom. It could use a clock on the wall though. Dont use the hotel phones for long distance, very expensive (3.75$ CAD/12 AED per minute) instead ask for a landline card at the grocery store cashier. The room comes with a kitchenette, a small fridge and hot plate with dishes for cooking. TV was okay and there was a dvd player. The pizza place in the hotel is fairly priced I suppose (abt 4$ CAD/12 AED for a small pizza with all the fixings) but it is not of the greatest quality. The buffett breakfast served at the hotel is disgusting (like curried hot dogs and chick peas with green eggs)- NOT WORTH THE MONEY- pick up something from the grocery instead. try to get a cheaper price on the stay by removing the breakfast option. Internet cafe in the hotel is actually just 2 computers in the pizza parlour seating area- no privacy- and it is expensive about 3.50$ CAD/ 10 AED per hour. i found another cafe outside of the hotel not far and it was 1 dirham per hour- worth the walk. I think they mentioned they were getting wireless connections in all of the rooms. Pool on roof is very nice addition, esp at night. There is a gym- i saw people working out, but didnt use it myself. I didnt book anything through the hotel tour place because they didnt sell what I was looking for, instead took a taxi to the museum (3.50$ CAD/ 10 AED) where I caught the Big Bus tour. Across the street from the museum you will see someone in a yellow shirt, thats who you buy the ticket from. It was 175 AED and worth it.
