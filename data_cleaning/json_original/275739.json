This is dog-friendly hotel close to the interstate that we've stayed at a few times during the past several years. We had no problems with the most recent stay although the room rate was bit higher. In March our room rate was < $75. At that rate the hotel value/quality was above-average. For the most recent stay, the rate was nearly $100. Summer rates perhaps? At that rate, though, the value/quality is just average.

We needed a cheap, dog-friendly hotel close to the interstate. We had stayed here about 2-3 years ago and had no problem with staying there again. Compared to other hotels in that price range (room rate + dog fee + tax < $75) it was above-average. I really liked that I made an advance reservation asking for a specific type of room (because of the dog) and got a room that matched my request exactly. I didn't notice any problems with the cleanliness of our room or of the hotel grounds and everything in our room worked properly. On the negative side, I thought the bed's comfort was so-so, but my wife thought it was rather uncomfortable. I skipped the breakfast buffet because there weren't any \"healthy\" options. Ironically, I went to \"Long's Bakery\" about 2 miles west on Southport Ave. I figured that if I was going to eat poorly, I might as well eat some fresh bakery donuts rather than store-bought boxed donuts.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whitewater, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cPlease don't stay at this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "frugalmommie22", "ReviewID": "UR72900256", "Content": "My co worker and I called back in at the end of April to make reservations for our week long trip to Indiana for a work conference. We asked BEFORE we arrived if the rooms had microwaves, refrigerators, internet and a pool. The man we spoke with ( who had a thick accent so I am unsure of the name) was Mike or Nick. Anyways, I was told YES, they have those things. We booked the room. On July 19th we arrived in Indianapolis and found the hotel. First of all, it's in the same parking lot as another hotel, the parking lot is awful. We parked and got our room. When we first entered the lobby, it didn't look ANYTHING like the beatiful photos on the website. We got our room key and went up to the room. First we noticed the smell, either moldy, or smoky or something. Then we noticed that there was no refrig. or microwave! The room wasn't the most pleasant, but we didn't stick around to find out anything more. We headed down to the lobby and asked about the microwave and refrig. They said they never told me the rooms had that and that there was nothing they could do about it. They said the King Bed room would have a microwave...but then I would have to share a bed with a co worker!!! Duh! Also, they would charge me more for the KING room. I started calling other hotels. Thankfully, We found a wonderful, very friendly hotel that had a room for the week. We \"checked out\" 20 minutes after we \"checked in\" from Quality Inn. The only good thing is that they promised not to charge my credit card and as of now, ( 10 days later) they haven't charged it.

It's not the greatest motel, but it's was half the price of the Country Inn across the parking lot. And since all we needed was a bed for a stop-over, it worked fine.

We needed 2 rooms due to the size of our party, and they both were disgusting. The walls are dirty, the one room had food on the wall, the other one had some sort of make up smudged on the wall in the sink area, which I was able to wipe off, housekeeping didn't bother. My husband noticed one of the sheets on the beds wasn't on all the way and when he went to fix it, the mattress pad had a giant hand towel sized yellow stain on it---nasty!!!! The dresser in one room was missing handles and the chair had dirt on the arm rests, it appears they never cleaned them. The last straw was the yellow and brown stained grout around the toilet in the bathroom of the 2nd room. Not to mention the moldy grout in front of the showers in both rooms. I have never stayed at a place so dirty. The wallpaper in the hallways was torn in several places or had gotten wet and did not stick to the walls any longer. If this is a franchise hotel, it is very clear the owner could care less about cleanliness or updating the hotel. When my hubby demanded a refund, a roach walked across the lobby. The clerk acted appalled, but I can only guess this is a regular occurence here.

We stayed there because it was one of the host hotels for the gymnastic meet being held on the 8,9 and 10 of February 2008. When we arrived there around 8pm we checked in and we were assigned a room, room103. The room was to be a non smoking King suite. When we entered the room the smell from old cigarette smoke could knock you over and the suite had one bed and two chairs. We complained to the front desk and the person behind the desk stated that \" I forgot we took one of the beds out\". We were then sent to a different suite, room 303. When we entered the room everything appeared to be ok. The carpet was a little dirty, but it got worst. The bath tub had two live spiders with spider webs in it. I killed the spiders, so we could use the shower. I then went to turn on the television, and it did not work. I called down to the desk and talked to a male employee and asked if the television could be fixed? He replied \"he could not fix or replace the television but we could check out and stay at a different hotel.\" He then said \"I can put you in another room\" which would have been our third room. I asked to speak to a manager he replied there is not one on duty. We booked this room in November 2007, because the other hotels in the area were booked up due to the gymnastic meet. We had little choice but to stay. I am so glad we traveled with our own blankets an pillows because four of the six pillows in the room were to dirty to use. One of the pillows had a big orange red stain on it along with a long black hair. The other dirty pillows had black spots all over them, it looked like dried black mold. I then pulled out the sofa sleeper. There were no sheets or blankets for the mattress anywhere in the room, and the mattress was filthy. So the sleeper could not be used. Due to the filth we were afraid to use the rooms blankets and pillows so we used our own. At that point we called the corporate office and spoke with a very nice friendly person that went out or her way to make us feel happy. The person from the corporate office advised that the corporate office would be contacting us by February 12, 2008. Corporate has not contacted us as of the 14th. On the 14th of February we received a letter from the Indianapolis Quality Inn & Suites. The letter stated I apoligize for the problems you experienced and appreciate the comments so that immediate changes can be made. After our experience at this hotel I would not recomend this hotel.", "Date": "February 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highland, Indiana", "Title": "\u201cA Nice Hotel, but...\u201d", "Author": "HoosierMom", "ReviewID": "UR4629362", "Content": "Stayed for a few days during my husband's business trip.
