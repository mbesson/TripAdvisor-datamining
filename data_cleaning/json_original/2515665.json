The living area features a sort of fainting couch and desk, with an ottoman for extra seating. For a single long-term stay user, probably sufficient.

It would be nice if they also provided manual dishwashing soap so that the entire dishwasher doesn't have to be used for a few cups and glasses. The exterior space by the pool and tennis court was very pleasant and shaded, with excellent and comfortable seating, with a barbecue grille available to use.

From the get go, I had an issue because I'd somehow mistakenly booked a room at the Courtyard Rancho Bernardo instead of the Residence Inn. Since I booked only a couple of days before we left, I didn't notice the problem until we were already at the Courtyard. The woman at the front desk there was thoroughly unhelpful as far as contacting the Residence Inn for me (they are both Marriott hotels, right???). Anyway, once I got Marriott reservations on the phone, they told me the rate for the Residence Inn was $108/night, while my rate for the Courtyard had been $87/night. This was a bit upsetting, but I thought of it in terms of free breakfast and a kitchen, and decided to change my reservation. Luckily, you can cancel without penalty until 6pm on the day of check-in. I think we happened to be at the Residence Inn on a fairly quiet weekend for the hotel. We had no trouble parking the entire time we were there (including one night when we came back at midnight), and we were in Building 2, which is right near the main building and the pool area. Our room was 1 queen bed and sofabed. French doors separated the bedroom from the living room, and bathroom had doors to both the bedroom and the kitchen. The kitchen was small, but perfect for the two of us. The only issue we had with the room was that the TV was outdated and not visible from the bed. An argument could be made as to not needing TV in the bedroom, but I think most people are used to being able to watch TV from bed if necessary. It was in front of the sofabed, though, so that's something. The sofabed mattress was stained, so we never used it (didn't need it anyway). The room also had a small balcony which overlooked the parking lot. I never used the fitness room, but it looked adequate. Breakfast was good each morning. The hot dish the first morning was make-your-own breakfast burrito. The second morning, it was biscuits and sausage gravy. You could also make your own waffles. My husband brought breakfast up to the room the second morning, and they provided him a tray and said just to leave the dishes in the room. Housekeeping, btw, was excellent. I can see how walking to breakfast from the other, further away buildings could be a chore. I would recommend requesting a room closer to the main lobby building. We used the pool on the second day. We had the place entirely to ourselves. The only problem was the lack of shade, and the wasps. Live wasps kept flying into the pool and floating in there. Also, the lounge chairs were dirty, and there wasn't a lot of shade. We didn't use the jacuzzi because we'd noticed painters near it the day before, and the residue from their paint might've gotten into the water. The location of the hotel is excellent for the Wild Animal Park (only a few miles down the 15 fwy). Also, it is near a HUGE outdoor shopping and dining area. We literally had every store or restaurant we could ever need within walking distance (up and down some hills, though). There is also a gas station/car wash right by the hotel parking lot, and a few restaurants and stores right next door. The staff was friendly, check-in and check-out were a breeze.

As a Marriott Rewards Platinum Member, I have stayed at several Residence Inns and this one has the smallest room\\space. The bedroom had a queen bed instead of a king bed. Instead of a separate kitchen table with four chairs, it had a kitchen bar with two chairs. The d\u00e9cor was dated. It had the same kitchen cabinets that I had in an apartment in a brand new apartment complex that I moved into 1985. It had Formica countertops instead of fake granite\\stone countertops that I have seen in other Residence Inns. The door to our room wasn\u2019t properly framed (see picture attachments). At the top of the door, it fit pretty close to the frame. However, at the bottom of the door, there was nearly an inch gap\u2026when you lock the dead bolt lock, the gap was large enough that you could see the carpet in the hallway. Due to this gap, you could hear every guest that walked past our room. I saw other doors with this same \u2018framing\u2019 issue. TV: The TV was old (no ports to attach our digital camera or digital camcorder to review pictures and movies that we took during the day). It was small (guessing it as 25\u201d or 27\u201d). It was no flat screen. We like to review our pictures and movies. We only watch 15 minutes of TV per day to catch the news so that wasn\u2019t an overall issue for us. Bed: It was very comfortable. It had luxury bedding. Desk: The hotel\u2019s website stated that each room had an ergonomic chair at the desk. The chair at our desk was not an ergonomic chair\u2026it was an old wooden chair that I have seen at several hotels throughout North America. Hotel Guests: It seems like this hotel attracts a lot of guests on the weekends that are there to see the attractions in San Diego. It seems like most of these guests go to breakfast at the same causing a shortage of seating. There are only eight tables plus three to five tables outside. If you come early, there were seating available inside. If you come at the rush, there is a probability that you will eat back in your room, standing up, waiting for a table and etc. On the Monday morning that we were there, the breakfast room was pretty empty. The set up for the breakfast room was different on Monday compared to Saturday and Sunday. Breakfasts: Due to the large influx of guests on the weekends, they removed the waffle maker (it was there on Monday) from the breakfast room; therefore, instead of having \u2018hot\u2019 waffles, they made waffles in the back, cut them in quarters and place them on a plate\u2026they were not \u2018hot\u2019. I like my waffles to be hot to soak in the butter and syrup. They didn\u2019t serve \u2018meat\u2019 (i.e. bacon, sausage links or sausage patties) for the Saturday and Sunday breakfasts. It is my guess that this was done to save money since they had pretty have more people eating breakfasts on these days. On Monday, sausage patties were served. They ran out of food quickly on Saturday and Sunday and it took some time for the food to be replaced. It wasn\u2019t the lack of service from the breakfast room hostess\u2026just too many people eating at the same time. Value: At $ 93.43 ($83.00 room rate plus $ 10.43 in taxes), it was a very good value. We wanted to extend our reservation by one day but the rate for that Monday night was $ 179.00 plus $ 22.49 in taxes so we declined. At $ 100 a night, the value was there but at $ 200 a night, the value wasn\u2019t there. Overall, if you can get a room rate under $ 100, set your expectations that this is an \u2018older\u2019 Residence Inn (especially if you have stayed at newer Residence Inns) and it is packed on weekends, then I strongly recommend this hotel for you.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cOlder than the typical Residence Inn.\u201d", "Author": "BearAndPenguin", "ReviewID": "UR18181802", "Content": "This Residence Inn wasn't bad, but it wasn't up to par with the other Residence Inns that I have stayed at.

There are steam trays full of eggs and pancakes, and various pastries. The location is convenient, with two reasonably good restaurants practically in the same parking lot.

We have a very lovable 130 lb. Great Dane and had a hard time finding a hotel that would allow a dog that size. Residence Inns allow dogs and don't have a weight limit. They informed us at the time of the reservation that there would be a $150 one-time cleaning fee, but when our bill came out, they actually only charged us $100. The staff was wonderful. Very friendly and really went out of their way to accomodate us. The rooms were very clean, nothing fancy, but more than adequate. Pets do not have to be crated but they do ask that you have the pet out of the room to allow the housekeeping staff to clean, which only makes sense. We only had them come every 2-3 days and would just get fresh towels on other days if needed. Free (wired) high-speed internet is also included. There was even a fireplace that you could purchase fire logs at the front desk to burn. The kitchenette had a microwave, upright fridge, and two-burner stovetop. One great feature is that you can leave a grocery shopping list at the front desk and they will do your grocery shopping for you. There is no fee for the service and they only charge you the actual supermarket price for the items. The free breakfast was above average and included scrambled eggs, make your own Belgian waffles, cold cereals, oatmeal, granola, pastries, rice, sausages, and potatoes. The food was pretty good but the eggs and potatoes did have a bit of an artificial flavor (like cafeteria food). We didn't take advantage of it, but there are also free social hours on weekdays and free managers dinners several nights/week. The surrounding area was very safe with some (but not a lot) of grass to walk dogs. Lots of shopping options in the neighborhood. There is a lot of traffic so you had to be very careful if you went for a walk. There is a small gym in the hotel but your room also includes free access to a health club that is about 1/2 mile away. There is also a small pool, hot tub, basketball/tennis court. For anyone with pets, especially for an extended stay, the Residence Inn was wonderful. We were on the go quite a bit so didn't take advantage of the food as much as we should have but it would be a significant cost savings for families with children or on a limited budget.

I booked through arestravel.com which allowed me to pay only a deposit of $15 up front - the rest was billed to me at the end of our stay. I booked a one room suite. We arrived late on a Friday night - we stayed in Building 6 - I had read the previous review about the higher the building number the closer you are to the freeway (and the noise) and I was happy - I could definitely hear the freeway, but it wasnt enough to keep me awake at night, although I assume if you are in Bldg 10 you would definitely run into this problem. The hotel is convenient enough to the I-15 freeway (it is right off the freeway) and is in the middle of a great shopping area - you can walk to the Olive Garden, Carls Jr., Subway, Chevron, etc. and is literally a 2minute drive to the Calif.Pizza Kitchen, Chevy's, Marie Callendars, Jamba Juice, Starbucks, etc. There is also a Ralphs Supermarket and Rite Aid right around the corner...VERY convenient. I loved the location! The room itself was kept very clean by housekeeping and I found nothing that I could complain about. Also, FREE high speed internet connection in the rooms! At the main office you can use their computer in their business center if you need to print out boarding passes, admission tickets, etc. I used it to print out our Sea World tickets - they charge your room $.10 for every page you have printed. The pull out sofa bed in the room was adequate - my kids brought their own bedding for the sofa bed, which was totally my preference, there were sheets for the sofa bed and extra pillows provided. My only complaint (which had nothing to do with the hotel) was the mosquitos - they were everywhere! I was going to ask to switch rooms as I thought it was a room problem, but my husband found a mosquito swatter in the closet and we guessed that this was a San Diego problem and not a room problem. I may be wrong, but we didnt let the mosquitos ruin our vacation! The morning breakfasts were great, but take everyone else's advice and get there early as tables fill up fast. There was a party of six that came to breakfast every morning and then leisurely sat at the tables chit-chatting while people waited for tables to sit at. Nothing wrong with that but common courtesy I guess would be to continue conversation elsewhere where the seating is not so limiting --- literally maybe 6-7 tables to sit at. The breakfast buffet always had dry cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, doughnuts and pastries, toast, bagels, fruit, scrambled eggs and fried potatoes. They alternated the hot entree offerings by serving hot croissants, french toast, pancakes the first day; french toast, biscuits & gravy the second day; and sausage patties and tortillas the third day, along with a rice-cooker filled with steamed rice. There is also a waffle maker available all days, but it only makes one belgian waffle at a time.
