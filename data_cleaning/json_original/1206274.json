The staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful. The hotel was absolutely spotless, from the lobby to the dining area to the nicely landscaped grounds to our suite. Our two-room suite was the largest we've seen and the decor was pleasant. The linens were premium and we had a very comfortable night. The kids loved the indoor/outdoor pool, and were able to swim outside in March. What a bonus! The evening happy hour had a very large selection of foods, enough that we were able to make a full dinner out of it. The breakfast selection was also quite large, and the staff did a great job of keeping it well stocked. We always seek out Drury locations wherever we travel and as usual, weren't disappointed with this fabulous location! Our one complaint?

There was everything from hot dogs and baked potatoes to make your own nacho's with cheese, salsa, and beans. They also had salad, celery, and carrots for the healthy folk. You were allowed 3 alcoholic beverages in the 2 hour window. I had a margarita, a tequila sunrise, and a screwdriver... all for free!!!! The \"bartender\" was even kind enough to make kiddie cocktails for the kids! There is fountain soda and fresh popped popcorn available almost all day (I think till 10pm). The pool was heated and was half indoor and half outdoor. Even though it was cold you could still swim outside! The breakfast was nice as well, with all of your standard items of eggs, waffles, bagels, juice ect. The room was very clean and comfortable. No complaints from anyone in my family. I am not one to post reviews often, but for this hotel I had to spread the word.

Both ladies took great care in their appearance, and were extra personable, represented the Hotel superbly. I'm not sure why some have complained of noise of traffic? I am a small town person, and this was just \"city noise\" Our room was across from a hospital, we heard sirens but they were not distracting. I am also a smoker, and it was nice to acquire a room that allowed it, although I would reccomend Drury think about installing air cleaners like Ionic Breeze in these rooms, would have brought mine from home, if I had thought about it.

I would see popcorn on the floor in the hallway when I leave my room and when I get back about 10 minutes later, it's been cleaned up!! The staff was great. I asked several times for confirmation or directions and each time, they would print up the info or directions for me to have. I saw the manager several times thoughout the day, walking around, talking to guest and asking me if everything was good. He acted like he wanted to make sure you were happy there. Never saw that at other chains. Of course, the free breakfast and 5:30 kickback food were excellent. So that took care of our breakfast and dinner. It's a great place for a great value.

So the freebies: 1) I called a day ahead regarding an early check-in and luckily (since I called ahead) they were able to prepare a room for us at 9:30AM (normal check-in time is 3PM). When I checked out and reviewed the bill, I saw they did not charge me for the early check-in! Most places I know would charge you a percentage or half the charge of the daily rate for an early check-in or late check-out. 2) Free breakfast. This includes: scrambled eggs where you can sprinkle cheese & cut up ham on them, toast, bagels (along with butter, jelly, & cream cheese), mini donuts, muffins, waffle maker to make fresh waffles, fruit, boiled egg, yogurt, sausage, biscuits & gravy to go with them, juice, coffee, and I might actually be forgetting something but it's a lot of good food to choose from. 3) Free popcorn & drinks (soda) from an old fashioned popper in the dining area available in the afternoons to early evenings (I can't remember the exact times). 4) Free \"Kickback\" 5:30-7PM which includes snacks like chips, pretzels, chicken fingers, hot dogs, etc. 5) Free Alcohol. We were given a card when we arrived allowing us to receive 3 alcoholic drinks per day per person. This can be picked up during the \"Kickback\" time. The had wine, cocktails, and beer. 6) Free Long Distance calls. Although there was no need to use this, I was still amazed. 7) Free Wireless Internet. 8) Check-out. The normal check-out time is 11AM, but on the bill it says if you need an extra hour to prepare to leave, just let them know and they won't charge for it. The customer service was very helpful, especially regarding our early check-in. Maurietta (not sure if I spelled it right, if it's wrong I'm sorry) was especially friendly and helpful regarding this. The room was clean. I wasn't used to the smell (from NJ, so Indiana could of course in general could smell different to me) but it was neither a good or bad smell. The bed and pillows were comfy.

We reserved a suite, so we could have some additional privacy and allow our restless toddler the opportunity to get some sleep (he is a light-sleeper). The suites are ~30% larger than Embassy Suites rooms, and have a full-size couch, as well as a recliner, and 37\" flat-screens with HD channels. The hallway separating the bedroom was 12' long, with a nice sink and countertop where the fridge and microwave was tucked away. The beds were comfortable and there was a variety of pillow firmness. At 5:30, we decided to check out their iteration of a manager's reception with the 'kickback'. It was great, with a nice selection of hot foods, a potato bar, egg rolls, and some fruit/veggies and what looked to be a bagged salad poured into a nice buffet holder. In addition, popcorn is available all day, as well as a soda-station; both are open until 10 PM, so you can get free snacks/soda until then. The pool is indoor/outdoor; understanding this, in the wintertime, the indoor section would be considered small. The hot tub was nicely sized, the exercise room was relatively small, with 3 ellipticals, and 2 treadmills. The business center had 2 PCs and a free print/scanner hooked up to both machines. Wifi was free and fast throughout the property. In the morning, the breakfast had scrambled eggs, sausages and bacon, biscuits/gravy, french toast, a waffle station, and cereal bar. There were pastries and yogurt as well, though not much in the way of fruit. Overall, it was a FANTASTIC stay, and a great value, inasmuch as you can feed kids and yourselves at the kickback substantially, and spread out in large rooms and enjoy friendly service. My parents were with us and had reserved a king room which faced I-69; they did say there was some road noise, but it was relatively isolated.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salida, California", "Title": "\u201cOk hotel.\u201d", "Author": "Stasia74", "ReviewID": "UR83885922", "Content": "Let's just say dont ever book thru hotels.com if youre staying here.

In the evening there was popcorn and free beverages. We really enjoyed the indoor/outdoor pool. Although the hotel was crowded, there was plenty of room to enjoy the sun and the pool - and we went back in the morning as well to enjoy the spa. The breakfast was also nice with so many choices of french toast, waffles, eggs, sausage and more. Really, this hotel was the best value of any out there.

The indoor/outdoor pool was a plus -- although it was too short for my husband to do laps. But still it is nice to have the option of a dip if desired, despite the season.

The hotel manager on our last day stopped by our table at breakfast to ask us how are stay was, my husband has traveled to many hotels on business an he said he has never seen that. Elevators were very quick.The only thing I think it misses is maybe a bar/restaurant. It was just a great stay! We would absolutely stay again.

The hotel is new and beautiful. Rooms are comfortable with everything you need. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful. Free evening beverages and snacks \u2013 always a plus. Nice indoor/outdoor pool and whirlpool. Staff for the most part, friendly and efficient. Value for money - outstanding. In fact, I cannot say enough nice things about the hotel itself. What could possibly be missing from this vision of perfection? The decidedly cool welcome I received when checking in at the front desk. This perception is undoubtedly biased as I compared it to the welcome we received (travelling with a pet) at the Drury on N. Michigan Road. In all fairness, the receptionist was not rude or inefficient but the difference between my first impression here, and my first impression at the other facility was like night and day. My first instinct was to turn around and walk out, while at the other facility I wanted to check in for a week instead of the three days we stayed there. I would definitely stay at this hotel again if not travelling with a pet. However, with a dog in tow, I highly recommend the other Drury or the Hotel Indigo in Fishers.", "Date": "April 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "illinois", "Title": "\u201cHome away from Home\u201d", "Author": "ontheroadIllinois", "ReviewID": "UR27821222", "Content": "I was a guest in your hotel for 2 weeks, while working in Indianapolis.
