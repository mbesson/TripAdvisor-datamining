We were going to settle on the second room and were then offered the original room we reserved. We had our luggage on the cart and opened the door. Imagine our shock when we saw someone else's stuff already in the room. Very scary! Luckily the guest was not in sight. We went back to the lobby and Jun called the owner for the third time. After an hour, we left the hotel and had to cut our vacation short.

We stayed Sun-Wed in mid March. The main purpose was a quick trip to visit USH. All of us really love it there and is much cheaper than Legoland or Disney. The hotel is very quaint. It is tucked up under the hillside in Hollywood. The cool thing that I thought about it is that there is one way in and one way out. There is a very small parking garage (free of charge) that you would think would fill up quickly, but we never had any problems finding a parking spot. The rooms are normal HIE rooms and the real selling point is the breakfast in the morning. It was a real value for the money and served the exact purpose of our trip. I would stay there again on another trip to USH. A couple of negatives though. If you get a room on the freeway side and are a light sleeper, be prepared to wake up alot. However, I just turned on the A/C unit fan and the white noise from that, mostly cancelled the traffic noise. Also, I read somewhere that the hotel has a shuttle to and from USH. That is not true. There may be a shuttle, but it isn't contracted through the hotel, or a hotel van. USH is always a great theme park for us. My kids really love the Simpsons ride and the Jurassic Park ride. We did these numerous times. From the Studio tour to the Blues Brothers we had a very fun vacation. Thanks for reading. I hope this review helps.

Another great Holiday Inn Express in my opinion. Very warmly welcomed by Jun on the front desk, very polite, welcomed as a priority member, & upgraded to a Junior suite, he even called our room after 10 minutes to make sure everything was fine for us, really appreciated. The room was great, spotlessly clean & spacious, comfortable beds. We were on the 2nd floor facing the main road but noise was minimal. Breakfast was really good, same choice as in other expresses and no complaints from me there! Got your day off to a good start. Jun on the front desk was great, you can ask him anything and he will help you out. I asked him where the best place was to get a photo with the Hollywood sign and he gave us an address for the satnav, got some great photos close to the sign, would never have found that location otherwise, its a bit of a drive up narrow winding roads but totally worth it!! Universal is roughly a 10 minute walk, basically turn left out of the hotel, walk down to Universal Studios Boulevard, turn right & walk up the hill to Universal & Citywalk.

The room was a little better than what I expected but nothing special it was clean soft bed no complaints. The only thing which I had read was that there was no solid curtain to block out the green light and you do get some noise from the road.

It is an $80 cab ride from LAX and about $40 cab ride to downtown LA. It is really close to Universal Studios, about a $6 cab ride. Walking there though is quite a hike as it is all uphill, the walk back, not as bad. There is no shuttle from the hotel. As well there are no cabs that wait there, you have to call to get a cab.

By this point though I had found a cheaper, nice and better located hotel in Beverly Hill (thrilled!) and told her to please cancel my reservation. More forward a month and I get my credit card bill to find out that my LA weekend had two hotel charges. One was from HIE for a no show. I call to discuss this issue. The agent saw clearly that the reservation was cancelled the same day and couldn't understand why the system still assigned a room etc. I was told that the charges would be reversed but to be patient since it can take up to 10 days. 3+ weeks later, nothing. A second call was made, this time the agent said that there was no details of a charge being made to my credit card and would send problem to hotel manager. I asked to have a call back the next day. 4 days come and pass, nothing. I call a 3rd time, she didn't even try this time, said that she would pass message on but can I please call back in the morning. 2 months, $200 out of pocket for a reservation that was never confirmed - still no resolution. Don't waste your time here. Their reservation being down was a lucky thing.

Free parking for the Metro (subway) is located near Universal and is a great way to go downtown or other locations around town istead of driving. Free Hotel parking is tight but always available. The breakfast was adequate and always well stocked but we got tired of the same eggs, sausage gravy, and dry biscuits. I think the pancake maker was broken while we were there. They did provide bagels, packaged donuts, 4 types of cereal, yogurt and plenty of fruit everyday. The pool is located next to the parking garage (very wierd) and we didn't use it. The pool is very small. We did see some kids enjoying it though. They told us the water was very warm. To use the elevator you must swipe your key card. This is a great extra level of security in the hotel. The laundry facility was sufficient and it was 75 cents each to wash and dry in big machines. I had to by detergent at the front desk. The front desk was always helpful and friendly. My request for a room on a high floor away from the elevators was accomodated. We were on the mountain side of the building (not the freeway side). Our room was extremely clean. The beds were impeccably made every day. Our pillows were labeled \"soft\" and \"firm\" so we could choose what we wanted. Towels were replaced daily and we always had extra. They were a bit skimpy though. The bathroom was just about as clean as I have ever seen in a hotel (rivaling 5* hotels). To me this is extremely imporant for any room of any price. I was very impressed with the maids at this hotel. They were friendly and worked very hard. I am unsure why someone else said they heard a neighbor sneeze because they walls appeared extremely thick between the rooms. The hotel was sold out the entire time we were there (Easter week). We didn't hear sneezing, coughing, talking, tv's, doors slamming, etc EVER. One reason you don't hear doors slamming is that the doors stop just shy of shutting, requiring you do push them shut. A wonderful inconvenience that added to the silence in this hotel. It was hard to believe all the rooms were occupied because at times the hotel was so quiet. Another person commented on the window used for after hours check-in. They did lock the lobby after about 9 pm and used the window in the parking garage. I saw this a smart not an indication of the unsafety of the local area. While we didn't walk anywhere it seemed the surrounding area was very safe. Our room was $115 which is very good for LA and this hotel is right in the middle of town. We did Getty Center, Pasadena, Hollywood, Burbank and Six Flags.

Well, I would've liked the price to have been lower than the $118/night rate I got, but I think I would've had to forego one of my requirements I arrived on a Friday morning and asked the person managing the front desk if it would be possible to check in early. He was very polite and friendly and found a room that would be ready for me within 15 - 20 minutes. Breakfast was already supposed to have been over, but everything was still laid out, so he suggested I have breakfast while I waited. The food was still pretty fresh and a lot better than what I had expected for a Holiday Inn Express. My room was clean and up-to-date. The bathroom was OK. The only complaints I have are that the hair dryer had some yellowish stains that would not come off. There was also a hair in the sink, and the inside of the shower curtain had a few brown and yellow stains on it. The cleaning staff was very friendly and courteous. As a caution to light sleepers, they did make a lot of noise in the morning as they cleaned. Parking is limited, but even with full occupancy, I managed to find a spot by the curb. I never felt unsafe my entire stay there. I came back fairly late both nights, and I never saw or heard anything or anyone unusual as I made my way back to my room.

Other than staying at the very pricey hotels adjacent to Universal, staying at the Holiday Inn Express was a wonderful choice. I was concerned about the negative remarks on this website, but found that the hotel was much better than I thought it would be. The hotel is conveniently located at the 101 South (Hollywood) Freeway. Across the street is a Chevron gas station. Within walking distance, there are a couple of quaint restaurants. When we checked into our room (Room #310), we found a large basket of complimentary chocolates, cookies, and 2 bottled waters. The room had a view of an alley - it wasn't offensive, but it wasn't the best, either. However, I would take the alley over a hotel roof. The room itself was immaculate. There were two Queen beds along with a desk, executive chair, lounge chair, and bench. We had ordered a rollaway bed ($15 extra cost) but it would have been too crowded to have the rollaway in the room. The room also had three phones in the room (one on the nightstand, one on the desk, and one in the bathroom). The bathroom is spacious and clean. The tub is one of the cleanest I have ever seen, and I have stayed at many hotels. It has a very nice Kohler shower head, and the curtain is on a rod that is curved for more bathing space. The towels are of high quality,. The room and hallway was quiet even though the hotel was full. With regard to the \"bleach smell\" - I would say the smell is more like a cleaner smell with a floral scent. It is not offensive and is actually pleasant because you know the hotel and room is clean. The carpet was in excellent condition - very clean with no tears and no worn spots. The ice machines are modern and dispense ice quickly. Hotel is well maintained. The hotel room card must be used in order to access the elevator. The breakfast is nice and is served from 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. We did not experience any crowds at all - there were only 2 or 3 at any given time. There is a nice selection of bagels, cinnamon rolls, crossaints, hard boiled eggs, dry cereals (several choices), oatmeal, muffins, donuts, and a variety of juices and water along with hot tea and coffee. Universal Studios is 1.5 miles away. It is challenging to exit the hotel because there is a three way signal light at the hotel. The signal is confusing. You cannot walk to Universal, but the hotel is one of the closest other than the very pricey ones adjacent to Universal Studios. Internet access is free, however, guests must obtain a cable from the front desk. You must connect the cable to your laptop at the desk, so it is not so convenient, as you must be at the desk to do work rather than any other part of the room. Lastly, the parking is limited. Guests must place a paper placard in the window to show they are guests at the room. In addition, latecomers end up parking next to the office rather than in a spot. Otherwise, I feel the room and the hotel was a good deal (I booked two months in advance) and was well worth what we paid.
