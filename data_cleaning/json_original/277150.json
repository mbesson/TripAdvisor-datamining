There is a hospital less than a mile away so the ambulances were going all night - if you stay, get away from the street side. --Our group had 4 rooms total and none of them looked like the rooms on the website with high ceilings, etc. - all were small and just barely okay. --The breakfast is as bare bones as the rest of the place.

It was never really too noisy, but coming from London I don't know how much I can comment on this! The concept of the hotel in this old monastery was great. It was lovely to have to walk past the church to get our breakfast in the morning. Lovely architecture. Breakfast was always filling, eat as much as you want... was always plenty to chose from. Would really recommend taking the lift to the roof garden - we did not realize this was here until the last night, but it was absolutely lovely, great views of Rome.

The property is almost 2000 years old, has been owned by the emporer's mother, served as a monastery, and houses relics from the crucifiction of Christ! Check out their website, and stay here if you're looking for a very reasonably priced room in a safe neighborhood, just a little off the beaten path, with a ton of history. The rooms were HUGE (15 foot ceilings) and very clean. The bed was resonably comfortable and the staff kept the place clean. We had a room that overlooked the monastic garden, and would open our double windows to see priests strolling through it in the morning and evening. The included breakfast was adequate but not fancy. Yogurt, juice, breads, spreads, american coffee and tea, fruit - just enough to get your day started until your first lunch break. Don't let the hotel's location on the city map discourage you - it is within walking distance to just about everything, including a nearby metro. We walked home from the Vatican with no trouble, since there is SO much to see and do on the way. The colisseum is just down the road. Don't forget to check out the Basilica attached to the hotel - the architecture is beautiful, and the relics are said to be from the actual crucifiction of Christ. Be respectful of those on pilgrimages, as this is a holy spot. The friendly, english-speaking staff can arrange a number of day trips and guided tours for you at a resonable price - we went to Pompeii for the day - definitely worth it. They will also hold your bulky key for you so you don't lose it during the day. I would recommend that you stay here at least once. You won't get the frills of some other, more expensive hotels, but it will certainly add to the quality of your Roman experience.

Our second floor room was equal to a fifth floor in New York City. Room was clean, sheets changed very day, toilet and shower were fine. Since this is a converted medieval monastery, there were some quirks with the electrical wiring. Nothing major, just needed to keep the room card in the slot to keep the electricity running. Once we got used to the concept, it was fine. Located about ten minutes by bus from the Termini Station - bus runs every fifteen minutes most of the day, then less often at night. Also near a metro stop, but bus is preferable. Facility is charming, with beautiful church right next door. Morning breakfast was adequate. Only complaint was that when we arrived from the airport after long trans-Atlantic flight the lift was not working. We arrived the day of an incredible rain storm - the bottom of the lift was flooded, so was the Metro. Metro was out for two days. (When we went to visit the Coliseum and Forum, both were closed; we were able to see the Forum the next day, but Coliseum was still closed from the floods.) So cannot hold it against the Domus Sessoriana for the non- functioning lift. Tip - take a coach from the airport instead of the train. Coach takes multiple travelers direct to their destination, and cost is EUR 15, train would be EUR 14, and then would have to get to wherever you are staying from Termini. (Given the flooding and closing of the Metro when we arrived, this would have been impossible.) We were in Rome the third week in October, and on the property of the hotel (property is city owned in Rome), was the location for Occupy Rome. There, as in cities around the world, mostly young people were gathered to express their grievances with a society that provides the young generation with no future, while threatening cuts in social services against all of us.

The reception staff I had dealings with seemed under pressure; the first I encountered upon check-in was very nice and did his best for us, but the night staff I found somewhat cool, unfriendly and only grudgingly brought a second blanket for the room after being asked for it five times. The main difficulty we encountered was with our arranged pick up service, which simply didn't arrive and after numerous phone calls, which were not cheap on my mobile phone's roaming network, we were offered a second pick up more than 2 hours later from our windy and uncomfortable location. We opted for a taxi and the hotel, to be fair to them, did agree to provide a free airport drop-off to make amends. However, I'm sure that had we not made a fuss this would not have happened as I had to ask several times if this would be the case or not and it took a full day to get a response. It was a weekend and the manager was not in house. Hmm. Had I not had a phone, as many travelers didn't, we would have had no idea what was going on.

I have planned multi-week, multi-city itineraries for myself and for couples who abide by the Rick Steve's philosophy of travel. All that being said, I found Domus Sessoriana to be an absolute treasure on mutilple counts. The building itself is a unique and historic venue attached to one of Rome's major churches with a fascinsating history. My first experience was in the main hall where the sight of large vaulted ceilings, expansive hallways and beautiful quiet ambience was sheer delight. And the room my son and I got the frst trip there was 3x the size of our 'chambre' in Paris. A view over the tennis court bounded by Hadrian's Wall, heated towel racks and 4 single beds which would never be found in a more mainstream hotel. As a monastery, it was exactly what I expected, which included quiet hallways, blissfully expedient sleep and elegantly simply decor. Sparse but very roomy, small tv ( I don't really care about that). Nice showers, clean and refreshing, nice towels and the convenience of said towel racks when you do laundry in the sink! Typical light breakfast was very adequate and, as I love observing the architectural aspects of these type of buildings, an adventure in the basement, or lower levels of the building. Sometimes navigating within the premises can be a bit challenging but that is a minor issue in my book. It gives one the opportunity to see more than you bargained for! A second stay there was a bit surprising as we were put in the upper, smaller rooms. Not at all how I desribed the palce to my then travelling partner. She was confused by the small and secluded room, but enjoyed the location and the overall experience as our vantage point offered us some great views of 'hidden' aspects of the building, the roof top view, the gardens, very different views of the church, Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, and the grounds. The church is a real treasure to explore! The location is fantastic as it excludes you from the busy touristy locations but is a brief stroll to San Giovanni in Laterano, then down to the Colesseum and the Roman Forum, the Baths, etc. I found it to be extremely delightful locatin and so peaceful to return to when all you want to do is re-charge before you go at exploring the treasures of Rome. You won't find bars and restaurant options.

The 7-10\" television looked like it had come from the 70s and the furniture in the room was similarly as old/bad. Better to not have it at all, at least the room would have more space. The hallways and elevator are dingy and in need of repair/paint. The whole feeling of the place is cold and austere. The breakfast was nothing special. Very few items to choose from and those that were there were all cold, quick breakfast type items. We spent hours trying to find another hotels to move to, willing to walk away from the money we had spent on this hotel, just to get a good nights sleep on a proper bed, but the internet connection is so slow and there is only 1 computer so getting on it and getting numbers, then going back up to the room to make calls proved more work and time than we could do. This hotel is not centrally located. It is in the San Giovani district. Any map of the heart of Rome will show this hotel all the way down in the furthest, furthest, furthest bottom right hand corner. I called the tourist help line- and the lady on the phone agreed and advised me that I wanted to be at least 2-3 metro stops further into the city to be somewhat central. The walk to the metro is not close or convenient and could be considered sketchy if you are coming back later in the night. Both Taxi drivers as well as people in the neighborhood gave us sideways glances when we mentioned the hotel, thinking we were part of some strange religious order. I wish I could find something nice to say about this hotel, but I really can`t think of a thing.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sheffield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Katie_uk82", "ReviewID": "UR116078650", "Content": "My partner and I have just returned from a weeks stay at the Domus sessoriana and we had a great time. This hotel is on the east side of Rome about a 20 min walk from the Colosseum and about a 10 min walk from the san Giovanni metro station. This was the first time we had stayed at this hotel and booked it based upon the reviews on trip advisor. The staff were friendly and the rooms were a reasonable size by Rome standards (big enough but don't expect loads of space). When we arrived on the sat the hotel had some problems with one of the boilers and part of the hotel had no hot water, due to it being a weekend this wasn't easy to fix so on Sunday when it was still broken we spoke to the front desk and they moved us to the part of the hotel that still had hot water. The rooms are very basic but well cleaned and the maids service the rooms every day. The bed was very hard but after a day walking around Rome we could probably have slept anywhere so it wasn't a big issue. The breakfast is European so you won't get anything hot, except coffee, but the croissants and lemon cakes were lovely. There aren\u2019t lots of restaurants and bars around the hotel (a few on the road opposite) but you can hop on the metro and be at the Spanish steps in no time. The line A metro is undergoing work at the moment so closes at 21:00 but there are plenty of buses running that will drop you at san Giovanni in laterano which is 5 mins from the hotel. We enjoyed our stay and spent most of our time out and about in Rome. This hotel is a good but offers no extras, so if like us you want to use it as a base to come back and sleep whilst you get out and enjoy the beautiful city of Rome then you should be happy with your choice.

And, at that time, I fell in love with it! It was so incredibly unique and lovely! So, when a friend and I were planning another trip to Rome for this summer, the Domus was the one I picked, based on past experience. The location is good; the fact that there is a beautiful church connected to the hotel was special and the association with the monks etc.etc...HOWEVER, once we arrived this time, I noticed alot of changes had taken place since my last stay several years ago. And these changes were negative, unfortunately. First of all, the whole place still has great \"bones\", meaning that structurally, it has a beautiful interior/exterior. What I couldn't get past was how DIRTY and neglected it had become! The walls need a good cleaning and a new coat(s) of paint. There were scuffs,scratches, and gouages in the walls that indicated heavy traffic. The floors need to be scrubbed and mopped thoroughly and the bathroom shower in my room (and evidently in other rooms as evidenced by past reviews) is moldy and needs a good application of bleach. My friend was assigned a room on the fifth floor. The room was interesting as the wooden beams were exposed but the air conditioning did not work (weather was in the high 80's so you can imagine the heat in that room on the top floor). Upon calling the front desk, the receptionist told her they'd look into it. Nothing was ever \"fixed\" or even attempted and she also was told later there were no other rooms available. The next day, the air still was non-functioning and my friend had to call once again. This time they agreed to move her to another, cooler, room. We found that the front desk staff, when asked to take care of problems (checking the air conditioning in my friends room; the electrical outlets in my room because they did not work with my curling iron, even tho I had a proper converter that worked at the other three hotels during our lengthy vacation elsewhere in Italy) was not as accomodating as most hotels. There attitude was like \"Suck it up and deal with it\"-and always with a smile. Also, the breakfast we found to be minimal and I'd grade it a \"C\". There were a few pastries (tasted like day-old bakery) and a couple of other offerings that were at best, average. This hotel could be SO beautiful and exceptional hotel IF ONLY the owner(s) would take care of their property the way it deserves to be taken care of...

We weren't so lucky in getting buses back from the centre however a lot of buses go to San Giovanni and it is only a 5 min walk from there.

The Conventual wing is at the back of the building which is probably a little quieter. The beautiful basilica is in the center of the hotel with the monastary on the other side. The refrectory and internet facilities are accessed using the room key which makes it very secure. All rooms are non smoking but our German neighbours did not conform to this house rule and we occasionally had the smell of cigarette smoke in our room. The staff were very helpful and friendly and any problems were dealt with quickly. Our room had the basics with excellent air conditioning and a safe for valuables. It would have been nice to have had tea / coffeee making facilities in the room. The staff at reception were also very knowledgable and helpful about how to get around the city - buses metros etc. from the hotel the main tourist attractions can be accessed by bus or metro. The two metro stations are San Giovanni and the Manzoni stops on the A line. This can also access the B line and the Colloseum. Buses 571 and 649 stop just outside the hotel - 571 back fromthe city , 649 to the termini. Eating out can be quite expensive anywhere in Rome. There are some nice restaurants in Via S Croce opposite the hotel and the average cost of a one course meal for two with a drink is 30 euros. We found that the supermarket in Via S Croce made lovely paninins for 1.50 euros as opposed to 3-5 euros in the city. Ideal for taking for lunches. The Villa Borghese a very nice park for eating lunch and this can be easily accessed from the Spagna stop on the metro. access to the park can be made from the metro station in the relative cool using escalators and moving walkways or outside in the sun across the piazza just up from the metro stop. Water can be expensive if you buy it - we found that the water fountains that are dotted around the city offered free, refreshing and delicious water whenever we wanted to refill our bottles.We bought a Roma Pass which is good value for money if you are staying for three days. It can give free entry for three attractions and metro / bus travel. We topped up with a metro ticket for the rest of our stay. The food was not that exciting anywhere in Rome and as I am a vegetarian the limitations of choice made eating a necessity rather than enjoyable. There is a limit to how tomatoes, mozarella and salad with pasta or bread can be enticing. Castle S Angelo is well worth visiting for the views across to the vatican city and it has a bar at the top.

The hotel, which is easily accessible from a door to the right of the main entrance, is just 5 minutes walk from the San Giovanni metro stop at the bottom right corner of most central-Rome maps. There is a small two minute trek from the front door to the hotel rooms, but we found that this added to the charm and the security of the stay. We asked for a room in the new wing and were lucky to get one of the bigger rooms there - room 209 - which was a fair distance from the main road and overlooked the inner courtyard. We had no problems with the king size bed, which was firm but comfortable. The bathroom was also a decent size, as was the huge wardrobe. Our room was mega warm, perhaps to warm the bones of some of the elderly folk staying there, so we often opened the windows for an intake of fresh air. There is aircon in the rooms but we rarely twiddled with it. We wouldn't say that our stay as noisy, though you can hear sounds from adjacent rooms, such as shower water etc, I wouldn't go as far as to say that this disrupted the peace.

My corporate travel agent booked a stay here for me because it was only a couple of blocks from the place I was working and was on that company's recommended list. (I have since asked the business to take it off their list.) I checked in on a Sunday, and discovered that the room, while perfectly clean, was really basic. As tourist, I would have been fine with it--it's what I would expect from a 3-star hotel and the price is very reasonable for Rome. However: They took full payment for 4 nights upon check-in, and then would not allow me to cancel--they have a 48-hour cancellation policy, so all I could do would be to cancel my last night, after I was done working, just sleeping over before leaving. That was hardly worth bothering with, to change hotels for just that one night, so I stayed. I obtained a pass for use of the WiFi in the room (10 euros for 7 hours). Unfortunately, I could not get on the Internet at all--and neither could a colleague in a different room (at least they warned her ahead of time that it might not work). I returned the password info, and asked for it to be credited to my account; they were agreeable to that, but I was still unable to work! Other things were less important but still annoying: there is no restaurant or room service, which when jet-lagged and working until 10 pm, is often preferable to going out. The hotel really is pretty far from everything--had to take taxis everwhere, especially to meet my clients staying in the center of Rome. Again, the subway is usually fine for me, but not in business attire, at night, in the pouring rain, to meet clients for dinner. There is no laundry service--might not have been a problem except that I was stuck with a white shirt with tomato stains on it and no way to get it cleaned. I could not even effectively wash it in the sink, as there was no stopper for the drain. No laundry service meant no laundry bag either, but fortunately I bought some bottled water and used the plastic bag the grocery store gave me for my dirty clothes. No stationery, so no envelopes in which to file my receipts. (I found a plastic bag to use for this purpose also.) No full-length mirror in the room; only the feeblest of hair dryers. No real desk set up (not that it mattered since I could not get on the Internet anyway). I realize these all sound like tiny matters, but when you are traveling for work to multiple cities, the small conveniences you take for granted in most hotels become relatively important.

The staff were pleasant and helpful. The full price, as for most hotels we investigated to stay at fairly near the centre of Rome, is quite steep. However, it's worth searching the internet for special deals out of the main season (including April). In the evenings there are a number of reasonably priced places to eat located close to the hotel, so one doesn't have to walk far after a tiring day seeing the sights of Rome. The hotel is easy to find being part of the monastery complex attached to the historic Santa Croce in Gerusalemme church. The S. Giovanni Metro station (Line A) is only a ten minute walk away and the Colosseum and Palatine Hill complex is also within easy walking distance (~20 minutes). If you have a spare hour, the National Museum of Musical Instruments, which is next door, is well worth a visit.

Rooms: Spacious, tidy and high ceilings, noise proof windows that can be entirely shaded against sun light. Air conditioning was in winter mode according to receptionist. It was useless for the heat in Rome at the end of October. We opened the windows during the night to get some fresh and cool air but there was a loud traffic noise.

There was no bathtub in the room, which was quite disappointing, as we would have liked to relax in a warm bath after a long day of sightseeing.

Very modest, just the essentials, and high ceilings. Although everything of luxury you need is there (tv, minibar, fully equipped bathroom, ...), you also get a feeling of living in a monastery. The breakfast was what I expect of a city break hotel: I've read that breakfasts in Rome were poor, but the selection was enough (cereals, yoghurt, a piece of fruit, bread, and some sweet breakfast snacks) and most of all, the quality was very good. The hotel isn't in the city centre, but a 15-20 minute walk brings you right to the city centre, and a subway station is a 5 minute walk. The neighboorhood is ok, and can be compared to the most of Rome city areas (a lot of grafitti!).

I was almost put off by the bad reviews, but am glad I still booked it! The review which mentions the smell of urine?! The smell I think they may be referring to is the rainwater running down the limestone blocks in the small open air courtyard or atrium between lobby and main building, the lack of sun gives damp earthy smell! Its not urine! You walk thru this section in about 4 secs! The hotel is very secure. The adjoining church has high locked gates, when the church is shut. There is always a man at the lobby, whom you have to walk passed to get in to the hotel, which is more secure than most hotels, where anyone can walk in with the other hundred guests. You need a key card to enter your room. The rooms are great, clean and spacious. With a TV, mini bar (v cheap), nice hard matresses, clean new, large wardrobes. The bathroom had a great powershower, clean towels every day. I booked on hotels, reasonable price, no probs with the booking. The location- well slightly out the centre, but very quiet- NOT seedy location! Hardly Brixton or the Bronx! Easy access to centre- 1Eur for 10 min tram ride to coloseum! buses run frequently thru night, bus and tram stops opp the hotel and train is not far to walk to. Quiet location, so much better than staying near the busy central station. The hotel staff all speak English and are very helpful. There are not many restaurants near the hotel, but most people tend to stay in the centre for food- not really a problem if you are only there for short break. The breakfast- great. Obv not your Amercian Buffet portions/a full English, but great European selection- meat, cheese, cereals, rolls, croissants that are freshly made! The dinning hall is a long corridor, and was fine off peak- but I can imagine it being busy during peak times. The hotel def has the wow factor, especially when you first walk up to it! There are the high ceilings and long corridors as seen in the pics. There is a great view from the roof terrace. The hotel is built into the old house of St Helena, who brought back lots of relics from her crusades, which are housed in the adjoining church- inc thorns from the crown of Jesus, fragments of his cross and the finger of St Thomas! This is not the hotel if you are used to be waited on and having the luxury of your run of the mill Hilton/Best western! This hotel is for people who want something slightly different from their stay in Rome! We would def stay at this hotel again on our next visit to Rome!!", "Date": "October 28, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cI fell in love with this hotel!\u201d", "Author": "TravelingEducator", "ReviewID": "UR2759136", "Content": "The Domus Sessoriana was a hotel I will definitely revisit when in Rome again! The staff was totally professional and extremely helpful and kind from the managers to the waiters. The exterior can be confusing if you are looking for the typical hotel front because the glassed hotel entrance is adjacent to the front of the church. It is magnificent architecture and inside you'll find the quiet and reverent environment of a scaled-down St. Peter's Cathedral. The ceilings in the very long and main hallway are high and arched-absolutely beautiful! Original paintings are displayed on easels and placed throughout this main hallway and in other areas around the hotel. My mother (79) and I stayed in a room from which the access was through the hotel lobby and across the interior front circular hall of the church foyer. It was extremely quiet at all times and the room was spotless and very comfortable. The air-conditioning never failed us (and it was HOT in Rome on the days we visited...high 90's). The beds were comfortable and the little round window in our room overlooked the picturesque circular drive out front. The complimentary breakfast offered was very adequate and situated in another long, rectangular room with that same arched ceiling treatment as the larger main hallway upstairs. When we first arrived, a white-haired Italian gentleman who was sweeping the church foyer, saw us struggling with our luggage and was immediately there at our side trying to help. Although there was a language barrier, there was no mistaking his desire to help someone in need of a hand. He carried our luggage to our door and did not hang around for a tip. On the morning of our departure he was there, as usual, sweeping the church foyer and as I was about to leave, I ran back to him and pressed several coins into his hand as a thank you for all his help. I'll never forget the image of him smiling and waving to us as our van pulled away from this WONDERFUL hotel!

This time I had a travel agency book my group of 13 people - 6 six rooms and had a voucher for each one. Some of my friends arrived the day before I did and one of my friends didn't have a reservation, they told her, so they made her pay again. The next day I checked in and had a room as big as a closet - my luggage didn't even fit in the room. I asked to be moved and they said they didn't have any rooms and that the travel agent should have requested a nice room.- I then asked about my friend that had to pay again and I asked why the Domus didn't call the travel agency - keep in mind the agency books with the Domus all the time. They told me that was my problem not theirs. The night before we left we asked the front desk to order us 2 big vans (taxis) for the airport ,they told us the price and we told them the time. The next morning when we were ready to be picked up and no taxi's were there, I went to the front desk to ask where they were and they said \"Oh you didn't confirm them.

On approaching the hotel, there is no written indication. However, if you know that it is a converted section of the Santa Croce church complex, you don't need the brains of an archbishop to figure that the large open door to the right of the basilica's main entrance leads to reception. We visited in a hot, late August, so the high, vaulted ceilings and acres of tiled floors were a cool refuge. I particularly liked the space outside the room - not so much a corridor as a long, high hall. We could see from the room plan on our fire notice that our four-bed room was the largest on the floor. It was clean, airy and simply furnished. More than one chair would have been welcome but the essentials were there - mini-bar, TV, safe, air conditioning and lashings of fresh crisp, white towels every day. There were small problems that the management should have quickly corrected, such as a bathroom door that would not completely close and no sink plug - but these were easy to work around. Having stayed in only 2 Italian hotels, I found the buffet breakfast adequate, but not as generous as in a similar grade in Germany or the UK. It is eaten in an interesting, elongated undercroft. The staff were helpful, polite and spoke good English. The 571 bus from around the corner takes you straight to the city centre and the Vatican. Unfortunately, in late August, the nearest source of bus tickets, a tobacconist opposite the hotel, was closed for the holidays. So, for the first trip of each day, we could not take advantage of the nearby bus stop - although a weekly ticket would crack this. The area around the hotel is not Belgravia but it is not threatening and contains a good dose of ancient city wall. Although there are no top class restaurants nearby, there are a couple of averages up the road and a useful bar/patisserie directly opposite. Our prize discovery was a brisk 15-minute walk up the Via P. Eugenio - the ice cream hall \"Palazzo Del Freddo\" of Giovanni Fassi. If you like lots of fussy trimmings and close, intimate surroundings, this may not be the hotel for you. Neither can I speak for the smaller rooms or for winter, when stone floors or the spacious roof terrace may not be so appropriate.

DS is about a 10 minute walk in a straight line from the Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterno. Once at the church of San Croce, enter via the glass doors to the right of the main church entrance. DS has very tidy and well appointed rooms and a brilliant rooftop that overlooks the Roman walls, the ruins and the church itself. In the evening, you can sit there and watch the sun set over the basilica of San Giovanni and watch the little bats wheel around in the belfry. In terms of location, the hotel is reasonably close to the colosseo, but I found it better to walk up to the San Giovanni metro station and take trains into the centre of the city. While it true that it is not next to any major restaurant strips, I found several very good Italian restaurants, a Chinese restaurant and a bakery just down the road (if you walk straight ahead from the church). The area is quite safe. Grafitti lines the walls and rag-traders line the footpath, but this is common in many places in Rome, and I felt much more comfortable walking back along the park than past the Termini or other popular hotel locations. DS will be one of my best memories of Rome and I strongly recommend it (as long as you don't mind a few Metro or tram trips).", "Date": "August 22, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, New York", "Title": "\u201cJust like a Country Club\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2271169", "Content": "This hotel was unbelivable.
