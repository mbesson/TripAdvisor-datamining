Our room was beautiful and well serviced, and the reception staff were very helpful and spoke good English.It's a 10 minute walk to the nearest metro station (La Prat del Llobregat - reception can give you a map) and then a 13 minute train trip into Barcelona's central station (Sants). You can buy a T-10 metro ticket for 7.20 EUR, which gives you 10 metro trips and can be used for multiple people (just pass it back after you swipe it).We thought it was quite handy to the city centre and did not experience any of the negative things some have mentioned below.

We have read a few reviews about the location of the hotel and there not being any bars and shops but we found that not to be the case at all, it was fine, and there was a big square not far from the hotel with bars to eat at and shops, the only problem not far from the hotel an underground parking area was under construction so it was to noisy to use the bars just up from the hotel would definitely do it again a great base, THERE IS A TOURIST PLACE WHERE YOU GET OFF THE BUS GET A STREET MAP, REALLY USEFUL FOR FINDING YOUR WAY ROUND LA RAMBLA.", "Date": "Jun 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR501764455", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "lujakiol"}, {"Content": "Good overnight, would stay again This hotel is relatively close to the airport and they do have a free shuttle in the morning that you book the day before.

We chose it based on it having received the best reviews of the other hotels in the area. However we were rather disappointed. Although built in 2001, and looking modern from the outside, it feels very much older. The style is very 'Seventies Spanish' with old, elaborate furniture and a very dated decor. The bathroom was large but the marble fittings were showing considerable signs of wear. The shower over the bath was only just adequate. The bed was reasonably comfortable but there were only two bolster style pillows for two people and these were very flat. Maybe we could have asked for more but we were already tired and frazzled. The room was adequately clean but the ageing fittings made it look shabby.The area is partly industrial and partly old, grim apartment blocks. I would not want to walk there after dark but then there is nowhere to walk from here anyway. The street was noisy but the double glazing did keep most of it out. The noise and disturbance we experienced came from the people in the rooms around us. It was possible to clearly hear neighbouring televisions, voices and bathrooms in use as well as the usual doors slamming.We didn't try the restaurant and the room service menu doesn't become available until 8pm and then is very limited.The staff seemed friendly enough but the hotel itself is in desperate need of a major overhaul.Although the hotel is close to the airport - a 5-minute drive - taxis from the terminals have a minimum charge of \u9227?5. When you add to this the additional charge for suitcases, the \u9227?.60 fare became \u9227?7. Whilst this is nothing to do with the hotel, for the same fare, you can reach a city centre hotel. For our return trip to the airport we used the hotel courtesy bus, which was obviously better although the schedule seems a bit vague.I wouldn't stay here again. I would pay a few extra Euros and head for a city centre hotel, which adds very little to journey time and practially nothing to the taxi fare.", "Date": "Feb 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR656763654", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "MM2H"}, {"Content": "not as advertised! watch out what you are getting yourself into.

I was travelling with my husband and another couple. Although I had read reviews that the hotel was not really suitable for a base to visit Barcelona's attractions, the hotel was cheap and we decided to give it a go.We caught the free hotel shuttle outside arrivals without any problems and arrived at the hotel at around 11am. We weren't able to check-in until 1.30pm but we left our luggage in the luggage room and set off outside to look around the local area. It is an industrial area but there are a few shops and bars nearby.We checked into our rooms and we were not disappointed - the decor was pleasant and the bathroom was spacious. The complimentary soft drinks in the minibar and the toiletries packs were a nice touch.We didn't use the swimming pool or sauna but did go to have a look at them - the pool looked quite small (adequate though) but the pool area was very light and airy.The breakfast in the hotel was nice. However we ate in the restaurant one evening and the food was excellent. We chose to eat from the set menu for 26 euros plus tax per person. At first we thought that this was a reasonable price for a three course meal but that price also included your wine, water and coffee - which was excellent value for such a good quality meal!The best bus to catch into the city centre is the no. 21 bus. If you exit the hotel and turn left, the bus stop is approx 40 metres away on the same side of the road as the hotel. The buses run about every 15mins and the journey takes approx 30 mins. This bus takes you to the port area, just around the corner from the bottom of La Ramblas. The cost of the journey is 1.25 euro each way. You can buy a 3, 4 or 5 day ticket but we never found out where to purchase these ( we were unable to purchase them on board the bus).If you haven't visited the city before, it is well worth buying a ticket for the open top tourist bus which takes you to all the main attractions - buy a two day ticket for 23 euros.Although I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel, I probably wouldn't recommend it as a base for tourists visiting the city attractions as even though it was only a 30 min bus ride away, we felt that it was just a bit too much hassle to return to the hotel after visiting the sights to dress up and go back into the city for the evening.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR480327432", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "mikcol"}, {"Content": "Good airport hotel       my room", "Date": "Oct 6, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR502989487", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "AdamStolarczyk"}, {"Content": "Cute Boutique Hotel in an Industrial Neighborhood As noted in the title above, this hotel was a pretty nice hotel. I was very surprised and impressed at how beautiful and romantic the room decor was; the bathroom was pretty roomy, modern, and very clean - all marble. Note that this hotel has a free shuttle that picks you up from the airport, but you must CALL the hotel to tell them you're there (unlike other hotels, that run a shuttle every x amount of minutes); they also lag a little on the pickup so expect to wait ~20 minutes longer then they say. We arrived pretty late at night and decided on grabbing a quick bite at the hotel bar and found that it was average food at high prices (even though the price was much better then if we had chosen to dine in the restaurant, which closes at around 11-11:30 pm). As this was the first night in the hotel, we found that it was also convenient that they exchanged our USD to EUROS at a fairly decent exchange rate. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to guests that arrive late to Barcelona on the first day as the shuttle service is very convenient - but that's about it. It is a very good value for the money, and you get to keep all the beverages in the fridge for free!. However, if you plan to use this hotel as your base for discovering Barcelona, be aware that it is in an industrial area with no shops/restaurants to go (really not much to see, overall). It is also a good 15 minute walk to the main train station, which is different from the train that services most of the Barcelona city area (where all the sites are).
