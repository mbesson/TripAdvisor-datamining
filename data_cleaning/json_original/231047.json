Given the location and price I doubt you will find a better two star hotel. No bells or whistles but great place still. I am an American and the staff were very friendly to us. One block from Charles Michel Metro; Easy access to all of Paris; less than 20 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, and plenty of cafes and bakeries within a ston's throw if you want a late night snack. You can take the RER / Metro from and to CDG with only one change of station.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat location.\u201d", "Author": "magda671", "ReviewID": "UR24584775", "Content": "Great location, close to the metro station.

Metro line quite close tho we didnt enjoy travelling on the Metro, hubby had his pocket picked by 2 young girls! BEWARE. Tour bus is great tho dont get a 2 day pass, 1 day is enough to see what you want and to get yr bearings. The white and green bus seemed better than the Red, which doesnt take you upto Sacre Coeur. We went straight to the Eiffel Tower next morning and there were only a handful of people in the queue, this was at 8.45am. We queued til 9.30 and then got straight into the tower.
