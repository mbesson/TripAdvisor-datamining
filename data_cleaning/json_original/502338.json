You were so polite and nice that i decided to come to your hotel with my mom, that is on a wheelchair You saw my email with my requests and by mail answered that you would have done the best to reserve the room i was asking for. So to me there was any problem, sure to face the requirements i made by mail, and sure that there was no problems for my mom. i chose your hotel cause you assured me everything was ok..... But the best had yet to come, i mean as i arrived in your hotel on April 5th (thursday), you showed me a very tiny tiny room ( nr 111 ). i started laughting, because it was letteraly impossible to enter with a wheelchair !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Because of it i was forced to chose a suite room ( Sophia nr 603 ) because of the many problems entering in your standard rooms. I am sorry but you weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sincere to me. i had to pay 203 euros more to have a suitable room for me and my mom. This money i had to pay as i checked into your hotel Golden Horn. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think this your behaviour is nice, because i was better for you to say by mail that your hotel wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t able to take people on wheelchair. so i could chose another hotel without problems.... This is not my fault but YOURS, because you wrote to me you would have done the best for the wheelchair. Our suite even i paied more money wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t suitable for a wheelchair especially the bathroom there was no way to get inside!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And to go upstairs at the 7th floor for the breakfast was diffucult because there was no lift and a lot of steps to climb. But for this you were nice and friendly offering the breakfast in our room. Anyway i decided to walk upstairs every morning to do our breakfast with our friends. Our first suite was horrible, i am talking about sophia suite. Bathroom very very small, not every day the ladies changed the sheets, in the bed, carpet in front of the shower with 3 halls ( no way for a suite, disgusting ), shower broken the water was or too cold or too hot, the the tube of the water inside the shower broken. Do you think this is a good service for the price i have paied ???????????????????? So i decided to call the reception and i was very very very very upset. Immediately three persons of the hotel came up to the room and i was so disgusted of the room believe me. In a very short time they fixed everything while i was yelling with the manager i think. so the next day i\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been moved into another suite i think the name is mehmen ( room number 607 ) or something similar. The room was ok but still the access to the bathroom was very difficult............... We also talked to the public relation guy met at the breakfast room and explained everything, he said to tell everything to the receptionist. My advise please is So i am wondering how can we solve this very unpleasant lack of understanding. I really think you have to give me back the extra money i paied for the mistake you MADE !!!!", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tirana, Tirane, Albania", "Title": "\u201cA great week in Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "ElonaBajramaj", "ReviewID": "UR128517148", "Content": "We had a great week in Istanbul; no doubt one of the great cities in the world..

I immediately advised both booking.com and the hotel stating that the additional room for the 3rd night was never intended to be booked, but even with 11 days notice, they pointed to the \"NO CANCELLATION\" policy and HOTEL MANAGEMENT had refused to budge. Booking.com and VISA have been unable to resolve this to my satisfaction. I've stayed at hotels all over the world and I have never experienced such inflexibility. Charging a guest for a hotel room that the manager knows was booked in error, especially where the guest actually stays 3 nights at the hotel, and causes colleagues to book rooms at the same hotel is a a degree of inflexibility that knows few limits.

Our room was right outside the lift, we thought it would be alright but it turned out to be a nightmare. The room was miniature, two single beds and something that resembled a bathroom, no room for more than one suitcase. The other suitcase had to be put on the floor and had to be moved every time we used the wardrobe. At first we were alright thinking that we just needed a place to sleep. However, when we saw the bathroom we were shocked! It was tiny. You have to be an acrobat to get in the shower. It was a sit-in bathtub with shower, where we had to climb onto the toilet seat in order to use the shower. It was horrible! Furthermore, there was no vanity unit, so the only storage place for personal bags was the toilet seat or the floor. When turning the shower on, the showerhead was not fitted properly so it moved and sprayed the whole bathroom with water. On our first night sleeping in the room, we were awaken by a phone call from some random person. We let it pass, thinking it was just the wrong number. The next night, the person next door snored and snored all night long. It felt like the person was in our room. During the nights we could hear our neighbours use their toilet and their shower. The walls are paper-thin. Also, the room was facing the very busy street and was very noisy! Two nights later, we were rudely awaken by some drunk idiots bashing and shouting at our door at 2am in the morning. We went back to sleep and were then rudely awaken again an hour later by the same drunk idiots continuing to bash and shout on our door. Sick of being woken up at such ungodly times, we called reception asking what was going on. The man at reception knew exactly who was calling and said he was very sorry and it was mistake and it would not happen again. We asked that we would like to see the manger the next morning. The next day we went down to reception and asked for the manger who was \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnot available.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Because we still had one night left in the hotel, we were adamant to talk to this manger, but he never showed, letting his staff take the blame. We were ready to move out and ask for a refund, when we were offered a deluxe room, as it was out last night we accepted it. The new room was nice but very extravagantly decorated, all we wanted was something that resembled a 4 star hotel. The breakfast was terrible. There food options were: bread, shrivelled up sausages that got more shrivelled up the longer we stayed there, boiled eggs and if we were lucky there was scrambled eggs. The coffee was never hot, it was always luke-warm. My so called 4 star breakfast consisted of one boiled egg, a shrivelled sausage and a piece of bread. I usually love the orange juice at hotels but the one they had in this hotel tasted similar to chilled vitamin C drink. There was also cold meats, I warn everyone reading this: do not eat the cold meats! My father got food poisoning from the cold meats, most likely because they are were not refrigerated properly. No care goes into the breakfast! One morning, I was putting sugar from the packet in my coffee and a moth came out! I was revolted! On the last day, we resorted to the McDonalds down the road, a much better choice. Overall, we would never go back to this hotel. It was a waste of money and no way can be rated 4 stars! Some staff members are very unprofessional, the stairs are a quicker way of getting to your room than the lift, breakfast is terrible and the room we had was horrible.

There was no vanity unit or shelf to place items like a personal bag, this had to be placed either on the toilet or on the floor.

The breakfast sausages were warmed up for days on end, at some stage there was only shriveled up sausages available. The meagre selection of cold meat was off and caused me a stomach upset. The standard of this hotel was in my opinion maybe just above Backpacker Accommodation, certainly not 4 Star as claimed by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153booking.com\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.

While the city was absolutely fascinating, the Golden Horn Sirkeci was a complete let-down. It touts itself as a 4-star hotel. Let me correct that to 1.5 - 2 stars. I was given a single room. Not only was it tiny, it was dingy. Here's a laundry list of its faults: 1, It had a double bed (which was firm and comfy) and a single utilitarian brown desk as a dressing table. The corner of one side of the bed was so near one of the jutting corners of the room that one has to be very careful if one needs to visit the loo in the middle of the night! 2. No coffee/tea making facilities, no kettle to boil any water, no complimentary water in the fridge. Gasping for a drink, I had to run downstairs (as opposed to taking the tiny lift which fits 3 - people - without luggage - at most) and across the road to buy myself a few bottles of water. 3. The mini bar is stocked with a few cans of heavily priced soft drinks. Oh, you'll also find ONE empty glass within. If you need more, you'll have to call room service and pay for the extra glass/glasses. 4, Was told they do serve hot drinking water if you call room service. It's free and comes in a cup, not a pot! 5. The air-con can't be controlled. It begins at 27C and if you stay long enough in the room - like overnight, it'll drop to around 24C. 5. The bathroom is a joke. A tiny cubicle serves as a shower stall - it's this triangular space that measures around 3ft across and 2ft at the sides. Don't know how my bigger colleagues managed to shower. The shower is a handheld one which wouldn't stay up on the holder. Upon complaining, a staff came to my room to ram the shower into the holder so that it couldn't ever come out again even if I wanted it to! This being the case, it was then subject to water pressure. If the room next door is having a shower at the same time and stops before you do, the showerhead rears all the way up and sprays OVER the shower screen, thereby wetting the entire sink and shelf area...and your toiletries! 6. Toilet seat - heck, I felt I was a kid again. It was so high that my legs were dangling!!! 7. Oh, by the way, I asked for a non-smoking room but was given a smoking room which, of course, smelled dank. Can't change cos all rooms are smoking ones! Now, if you're thinking I've just been unlucky, you're wrong. Out of the 15 rooms our company booked - 4 singles, 8 doubles and 3 triples - 90% of them are just as bad. Only 1 or 2 rooms were decent, regular rooms, worth of perhaps a 3-star claim. I would say that my room is comparable to one of those cheap, old b&bs in london. Yes, it's that run-down. On the plus side - the buffet breakfast, which was the same everyday (we were there for 5 days), was pretty decent. The yoghurt was delicious as were the many varieties of cheese. The location is the BEST thing about the hotel. Right in the middle of the historical area and within walking distance to all the historical attractions - Blue mosque, Ayasofya, grand bazaar, Egyptian spice bazaar, etc. The roads are cobbled streets and there's a host of cosy restaurants in the nearby surrounds. The tram stop is also just down the road, which makes it easy to access other parts of Istanbul, like the swanky, new, modern shopping centres for a taste of modern-day Istanbul. There are several other hotels along that road - I would recommend that you check those out and not this one. For the price it commands, it's definitely poor value.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cTHE GOLDEN HORN HOTEL SIRKECI\u201d", "Author": "tkirazli", "ReviewID": "UR118656609", "Content": "I visit istanbul this summer with my family and stayed in golden horn at sirkeci. excellent service and location. walking distance to most important historical places in istanbul. so, you don't have to worry about transportation. besides, the view of the room are great, and people who are working there are kind, genial, and so helpful. overall, I strongly recommend this hotel for everyone if anyone wants to travel to Istanbul.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "sydney", "Title": "\u201cNot even 2 star\u201d", "Author": "TessaSydney", "ReviewID": "UR118636087", "Content": "Listed as 4**** boutique hotel by my tour company.

The room was in a lower floor , i think at the 2nd floor, we asked to change the room because of all of that and the hotel representative extra charged us about 50 euros more/night for a bigger room....i think a human hotel room in this hotel is only at the last floor(5th), the hotel was ranged at 4 stars but i think it deserve only 2 star!

The air conditioning didn't work well and timed out so you woke up sweating several times a night. There was no bar (apparently the owner disapproves of alcohol - and overnight guests) ther was no restaurant or room service or any other facility you would expect in a four star hotel. I was there four days before I learnt there was a roof terrace where breakfast was served so I think much of what I was saying was misunderstood. I was robbed on my first day in Istanbul by somebody who said they knew engaged me in conversation and sais they receptionist where I stayed. When I returned to the hotel very shaken and reported this to the receptionist he said he did not know the man and gave out to me saying if 'I wanted to buy carpets or some things I should have asked him as he could get good deals' - The theft had nothing to do with carpets - I was mugged going into a Turkish Bathouse which was top of my list going there. Budget and confidence dented I stuck close to the hotel and it was grim. The receptionist once called me a Taxi to Taksim and it turned out I paid about triple what it should have been. Towards the end of my stay I decided the Bathouse experience had to be had so booked through them and was quoted 50 lira including a lift to the bath.

However, beware of the following: The pictures on the web-site may are not all from the same hotel. There are two Golden Horns, one in Sirkeci and one in the Sultanahmet. When you make your reservation ASK about the rooms. We stayed at the Sirkeci site, and the rooms, toilets and restaurant did not look anything like the photos on the web-site. Unlike the representation on the web-site, the rooms did not have sound-proof windows, bathtubs or a minibars. They were NOWHERE near the size as the photos on the web-site depicted. There was not even room in the room for a chair, and to sit down you must sit on the floor, the bed or the toilet. Although the web-site advertises a bar the Sirkeci bar offers non-alcoholic drinks only. The bar does not offer alcoholic beverages PERIOD! Avoid the fifth floor, as the sixth floor is undergoing heavy re-construction and the noise and dust is pervasive. Ask for a room with a window that opens. The window in our initial room was screwed shut. The air-conditioning was either hot/cold. Management obligingly changed rooms when we requested a room with a window that opened. Contrary to the web-site representation, at Sirkeci the toilets have showers only, and they do not drain as quickly as even the lowest volume of water required to shower, and your feet soon will become immersed in gray water with black specks floating in it. We tried twice to get this corrected but the General Manager and the maintenance person did not view it as a problem and it persisted throughout our stay. The hotel has a strict policy against bringing in outside food and drink, including water. This is a problem, as the hotel water is not potable, the mini-bar has only two 1/2 litre bottles of non-gaseous water in it, and cost 8ytl each. There was no fruit available in the hotel and the only snacks were Cheetos, pistachio nuts (unshelled) and candy. Their restaurant was good and the staff was friendly, but, if it matters to you, they do not serve alcohol, not even beer. They make you pay your entire bill in advance, and refuse to honor their own 48 hour advance notice rule for cancellations. We were notified by Turkish Air of flight problems that required we leave a day early in order to ensure our connecting flight home. Even though we notified the hotel four days (over 96 hours) in advance, we were told that since we had already checked in the hotel would not refund the one-night charge because our notice was not 48 hours in advance of our initial arrival. This was disturbing enough, but the General Manager told us that even if the room was rented to another party, we would not be credited for the night. The internet was frequently unavailable. There were many other hotels in the same block. Check them out before agreeing to stay at the Golden Horn. If you stay here, call and ask about the rooms.

I found the hotel while touring the area and I think it is the best choice that I ever made. Actually, I was amazed with the service that I got for the price that I paid. It is right in the middle of the center of the city, close by to everything and to all action. The rooms are very nice and clean. All the onsite management and stuff was very respectful and super hospitable. The service is number ONE! Specially Mr. Mesut from the reception was amazingly helpful during all my stay and I can say that he guided me for all the site seeings that I made. Istanbul is a great city and is a must see and the Golden Horn hotel is the best choice that you can ever make. I will definitely recommend it to anybody who visits Istanbul. Do not visit the city without staying at Golden Hotel, you won't regret it.

The hotel is very well located, just minutes away by foot to the major important sites like topkapi palace, hagia sophia & blue mosque and just beside the tram station and then anywhere to Istanbul. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful in answering any question and they can arrange very nice tours also.

On the positive, the hotel has wireless internet throughout the hotel and includes a free breakfast in the hotel restaurant. Speaking of the restaurant, the food is adequate, not great, but the view from the roof is great so you may want to eat here one night just for that reason. My room had been recently renovated (some have not yet been renovated) and was overall in good condition. A small flat-panel television was mounted on the wall. Now for the negatives. The rooms are quite small and the beds are very close to each other. So, if you will be sharing the room with someone keep in mind that even though you are in separate beds you are practically sharing a bed with them. Also, the showers are tiny. While the water pressure and temperature are great, even turning around in the shower can be a challenge especially if you are not a petite person. All in all, I'd say the hotel is quite adequate.
