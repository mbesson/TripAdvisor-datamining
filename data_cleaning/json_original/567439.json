{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Hotel Pension Elite On my recent visit to Berlin I stayed in the Elite on Rankestrasse,It is located on 4th floor of building. The stairs is quite a climb but there is a small elevator which I recommend you use. The room was clean and comfortable with on suite, high ceiling and very quiet. One negative on room was the lighting, only a few side lights so if you want to read at night it is very difficult. Staff friendly but do not speak alot of english. Breakfast is self service and food is plentyful. There is no other food service or bar.The location is excellent for getting around to visit sites and shops. Main shopping street around the corner. Train station and underground a short walk away. I found area very safe and would recommend as base for short visit.", "Date": "Oct 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR521170288", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "AlanDublinIreland"}, {"Content": "Pleasant staff, clean room I only needed a single room for one night and found the Elite on venere. It is a good bargain for the budget-minded traveler and in a superb location, an easy walk to Ku'damm and Zoo Station. The bathroom arrangements were a bit eccentric, in a pleasant sort of way, and everything was very clean. The staff I met were lovely, pleasant women. I was encouraged to have breakfast but had to catch a plane. I would stay there again without hesitation.", "Date": "Aug 26, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR261364717", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "UncleRicky"}, {"Content": "nice people nice people/good atention, very friendly staff/nice atmosfer-ambiente/bathroom in single room a little bit too small.
