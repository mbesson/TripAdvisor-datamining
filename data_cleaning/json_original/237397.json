The bathroom was ok, the taps etc could have done with a good polish, although this was carried out before the 4th night, probably a different housekeeper. Breakfast was very basic, tea and coffee, fruit juice (no choice), yoghurt and a basket of rolls, jam, butter and one cheese portion (dairylea); The front desk was efficient but no warmth to the welcome.

I was arriving in late from Venice and being a first time vacationer to this city, I did not want to have to travel too far to get to my hotel. It is really a stone's throw away from the alilaguna station. I saw that the reviews on tripadvisor were not great but decided to put convenience over comfort. I think I really regretted that choice. The lobby of the hotel is rather charming, the helpfulness of the staff was mixed. The hotel room was seriously a blast from the past with all the furniture you can imagine from your grandmother's living room. The toilet was decently clean but I had to flush it a few times before anything would go down. I got stuck in the toilet and had to ram my way out by pushing my shoulder against the door. The sofa in the room had mysterious blotches of stuff and crustiness at some corners. It's really noisy until early in the morning because the hotel is really close San Marco Square, I can't really blame the hotel for this but if you are a light sleeper, this hotel is not an option for you. Some might love the charm of this hotel because it is probably representative of the era in which it was built, but unfortunately, my husband and I are not people who enjoy this kind of charm. That being said, the one redeeming thing is that you are right next to the square, all the famous brand name stores are right downstairs, we conveniently walked to the Rialto bridge area from the hotel as well.

One of the highlights of our stay in Venice was attending the Vivaldi concert in a beautiful historic church, San Vitale, at the north end of the Accademia bridge. We learned of the concert from literature in the lobby of the Casanova Hotel. Venice was crowded in September, but we managed quite easily to escape the crowds. For instance, we spent a leisurely and quiet afternoon exploring the small island where the San Giorgio Maggior church is located, going up in the bell tower for wonderful views, and sitting in the piazza in front of the church at water's edge, sketching the view of St. Mark's across the canal.
