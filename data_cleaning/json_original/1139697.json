The bathrooms however were spacious however I did notice an awful lot of hairs all over the showers and floors which suggests to me that it only had a very basic going over by the housekeeping staff before my arrival. I had room service on the morning I arrived and it was acceptable however I would be inclined to go somewhere else for food next time as it was only just standard.

Overall - great stay. We got an upgrade on our room on arrival and had a lovely big room on 4th floor. Staff at hotel are pleasant and helpful and check in very fast. There is a pub on site open until 02.00 daily. There is also a Thai restaurant which has received good reviews on T.A. We ate there one night as it was very handy and we did not feel like going out, however, while it was o.k. I think there are probably better choices close by, personally I thought the menu was not great/limited and the desert choice was terrible (sadly!). The hotel is five minutes walk from Mall of Emirates which is a real plus, a safe easy walk even at midnight. There is always a taxi outside the hotel if you want to head further and the metro station is only a short walk away. The main road outside the hotel is always busy so a room at the back is probably best, we were at the side and heard no traffic noise at all. There is free internet access in the lobby, (one printer) and a tour company selling local tours daily beside reception. Maybe shop around on the tours through. There is a small pool and gym on the terrace and the public areas are pleasant. I think this hotel is not a bad choice for wheelchair users, the lift service is good, rooms spacious and there is a ramp at the main door. The only negatives are the price, this is not a cheap option but then I doubt there are many of those in Dubai and also that the cleaning of the room was good but not brillant, the floors could have done with a good mop! We were there in Jan but I had the air conditioning on, I don't do heat well! While it kept our room lovely and cool, I don't think it would have been adequate in the summer months in Dubai, but perhaps they can crank it up then.

It is about 20 - 25 minutes driving from the airport with a taxi (~65 - 85 AED; depending on taxi and time (day/night)). The Mall of the Emirates is around the corner of the hotel, which is a big plus. The Dubai Metro runs in front of the hotel as well as the Sheikh Zayed Highway. The closest Metrostation is the Sharaf DG Station which is located to the left of the hotel, the other station is the Mall of the Emirates station which is located to the right side of the hotel. You could buy a Silver Nol (20 AED including 14 AED credit; cannot be returned after use), a Red Nol (don't know the price, but you can make ten journeys) or seperate tickets for the Dubai Metro. The location of the hotel is ideal because it's close to the Dubai Metro which you can use to explore the whole city. You must be aware of the fact that the red line is still the only line which has opened of the Dubai Metro, the Green Line will open around September 2011. One extra tip, watch out with asking for a taxi to the concierge, we've expercienced that he gave us a quite expensive Lexus-taxi whitout meter. So, arrange a taxi by yourself, there are always taxi's at the front of the hotel. The hotel also provides a Shuttle Bus, I don't know the exact destination. The arrival at the hotel was very good, we arrived at night and upon arrival we've got a welcome drink and a wet towel. Check in was very fast and well organized. The lobby is not really big, but it is okay, it is located in the atrium of the hotel, which is really nice. The hotel has 7 restaurants, which is a lot for such a hotel. We eat in neither of them because it was quite expensive (breakfast: 90 AED), the shopping malls have cheap foodcourts, which are quite good. We had a nice bellboy, who talked to us for twenty minutes after delivering our suitcases, he was very kind so this is a plus for the hotel. We booked an executive room with an extra bed, there was no breakfast included, this is a drawback because it usualy is included at an executive room. At arrival the room was completely prepared, except the extra bed. But the houskeeping installed it very quick. The room was realy huge, it is the hugest hotelroom I've ever stayed in. There was one big kingbed, two armchairs and two desks. There was a lot of space in the hotelroom, which we really appriciated. The hotelroom was a bit in Middle East Style with some elements from the Middle East, such as lamps. The view from the hotelroom was at the Dubai Metro, Sheikh Zayed Road and the Burj Al Arab. It's easy to see that the hotel is a little bit older, there are dark lines at the ceilings and the airconditioning is dirty and old. High-speed internet is available in the room, it is available with wire but also wireless. The connection with wire was complementairy (it said (although the service guide said that it was available for a fee); executive room). The bathroom of the room was, in comparison to the hotelroom, quite small. There was a toilet, a bidet, a sink with mirror and a bath with shower. The bathroom was the main disappointment of this hotel and looked at some points quite old. When we showered the water flowed along the side of the bath to the floor, the result was a wet floor every time we showered. I consider this as a major drawback. Another light flaw was that the towelrack was not firmly attatched to the wall and it hung as it could fall at any moment. Housekeeping is very good, when we asked for an extra blanket, mug and towel they gave it us immediately. This was the same when we asked for an iron. The rooms are cleaned good as well. Good service! Check out was really fast as well. We had a late check-out (2:00 pm) which is available at request, after 2:00 pm you pay half of the room rate. After checkout we experciened one more con, we studied the bill closely in the taxi to the airport and discovered a subject a the bill where we couldn't exactly determine of where it was charged for. At the airport we've sent an email to the hotel, but they don't reply after multiple tries at the email. The have read the email but they don't reply. Due to this fact I conclude that the aftersalesservice is quite bad. Now I've sent an email to Holiday Inn Customer Care and not to the hotel, I hope that they can solve it. There is a gym and rooftop pool at the hotel, but due to the weather it is way to hot to swim in the pool. The overall performance of this hotel is good and unless the disadvantages I would recommend this hotel to a friend. Pro's: + Fast check-in and -out + Nice staff and service + Nice view; + Free Highspeed Internet + Very close to the Dubai Metro (red line) + Very Close to Mall of the Emirates Con's: - No breakfast at executive room rate - Quite old, mostly the bathroom. - Bathroom is small compared to room - Poor aftersales", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to recouperate during a stop over\u201d", "Author": "Tez from Oz", "ReviewID": "UR112670709", "Content": "My wife and I stopped for one night on the way to europe for Australia.

I was with my wife & another couple. We had a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms were very comfortable & clean. The bed was really comfortable with a choice of pillows. Our rooms were at the back of the hotel on the 6th floor & very quiet. The only noise we experienced was with workmen going up the outside of the building in a cradle one morning, however being at 9am it was not much of a problem. The only negative re. our rooms is that the air conditioning for the bedrooms is set via one controller, therefore both bedrooms will be at the same setting regardless. The lounge area has it's own controller. All the staff we had contact with from front desk to housekeeping were efficient, friendly & helpful. The laundry service was quick & reasonably priced. I must also mention that unknowingly I sent my jeans down to the laundry with 600 AED in my pocket. Within 5 mins I had a call from housekeeping & the money was quickly returned....top marks for honesty! The pool was busy during our stay & there never seemed to be enough sunloungers, however given the limited space I suppose this is understandable. We still thought that another 6 beds could have been fitted in. The waiting staff at the pool bar vary rarely make it upstairs to the pool area, so if you require anything it's quicker to go down & order it yourself. Special mention must be given to the lifeguard on duty who always had a smile & ensured that when a lounger did become available it was positioned where required very swiftly. The hotel is reasonably well positioned for most of the attractions you will want to see in Dubai. The Al Barsha Metro is 2 minutes walk across the road & this coupled with the cheap & plentiful taxis made travelling around very easy. The Mall Of The Emirates is an easy 5 minute walk from the hotel & is an amazing place to visit If shopping is your thing or if you need to merely visit the supermarket (Carrefour.) The array of shops is simply stunning. It's also the venue for Ski Dubai. The food court caters to every taste & is reasonably priced. Tip: if walking to the Mall take care on the zebra-crossing that is situated on the bend, especially on your return journey as it's a bit of a blind corner. Not all drivers stop at pedestrian crossings! My wife in particular was worried about the dress code in Dubai as we had never visited before. I would say now that there is no need for concern. You will see every style of dress in the Malls, most appropriate & some not so. We even saw a woman wearing a thong on Jumeira Beach which we thought would be a complete no-no! In the evening dress as you would normally for a night out at home, use common sense & you'll be fine. Tip: as all the bars are situated in hotels, most of the smart high end hotels frown against guys wearing shorts/trainers in the evening. Restaurants such as Trader Vics will not permit this either. To summarise: we had a fabulous trip & The Holiday Inn Al Barsha made for a great base from which to explore all the wonderful things that Dubai has to offer.", "Date": "April 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aberdeen", "Title": "\u201cBusiness Trip with some free time !\u201d", "Author": "Karen M", "ReviewID": "UR102156048", "Content": "I arrived at the hotel at 2.30am.

We'd booked an executive room incl. breakfast. The room was massive with all the usual facilities, incl. iron & ironing board (a necesssity in the circumstances). Other smaller rooms seemed to have similar facilities excl. the ironing stuff, fluffy slippers and dressing gowns. Free water every day. Breakfast was more than adequate with good and slightly changing selection. The only time we attempted to stay in for an evening meal, at the Gem Garden, one of about four eateries, they'd no beef, they'd no lamb, so they'd no customers and we went elsewhere. The hotel's position is pretty central in newer Dubai, and just five minutes careful walk to Mall of the Emirates, the one with Ski Dubai, where there are a whole host of eating places, most very good and not overly priced. It's also close enough to the Metro to be useful, (non of the beach hotels are close enough to the Metro). A trip from Mall of the Emirates Station to the airport takes 40 minutes, but trains do not run during the night, so check first. However the closest/easiest station to the hotel is Sharaf DG, not the Mall of the Emirates station! Sharaf DG is the next station. You can easily get to the Marina on the Metro for an evening meal or visit the Dubai Mall & Burj Khalifa (about 4 metro stops plus a 15 minute walk at the other end, in the sun). A trip up the Burj K is well worth doing - it's about 100Dhs if you book and pay online or by phone a day or more in advance, but it's 4 times as much if you just turn up, The spacious almost totally enclosed viewing area is on the 124th floor and you hardly feel the lift move (in fact they've installed arrow lights in the walls to help give the impression of movement). I timed it coming down and it took just one minute and eight seconds! Impressive and not at all scary. The hotel also has a supply of it's own and normal taxis outside (compare prices) and it's own mini bus holding up to about 20 for larger groups. Taxis are the main way of getting from a to b in Dubai, so expect to use them. They're quite cheap especially if there's 3 or 4 of you, but it helps to have a clue where you're going and what else is nearby. Never expect to go the same way to anywhere twice! We've been ten times now and the roads are noticeably quieter than two years ago although busy at times. Best recommendation for actually seeing the bulk of Dubai in an informative way is to book a two consecutive day Big Bus Tour ticket - do the beach tour one day and the city tour the next (you get free entry in to the Dubai Museum which is well worth a visit and is mostly air-conditioned and underground and you can also build in a free one hour dhow cruise on the Creek). The tours are hop on, hop off as you want, with a recorded commentary. In an evening go to the hotel's roof top bar area (it's near the rooftop pool), enjoy the warm evening air in an Arabian style setting, and try a shisha for a laugh. You'll hear the metro trains and the traffic on Sheikh Zayed Road but it's not really a problem, in fact it's fascinating watching it all. We've tried various hotels in Dubai over the years and to be honest they've all been more than acceptable. This Holiday Inn is a match for any of them and, certainly for us, was in a better postion than most - not because it's by anything in particular except Mall of the Emirates, but that it's easy to get to other places from here by taxi without it costing too much.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, England", "Title": "\u201cGood for business\u201d", "Author": "heb999", "ReviewID": "UR80124993", "Content": "My second time here and I looked forward to returning.

The rooftop pool is fantastic, with great views of the Burj and sometimes the Atlantis on the palm if its a clear day. Dont eat in the hotel as its so expensive. We had breakfast on our first morning and we paid \u00a320 each!!!! Instead just pop to the mall and eat there as its very cheap and resonable, with lots of places to choose from. We also had a drink one night in the sports bar on the ground floor, myself and my mum were the only 2 women in there as it is full of men on business! Then a few women arrived, mostly Asian women who were all over the men and were obviously prostitutes!!! It was alittle suprising but fun to watch them around the men! Needless to say we only visited there once! We also took our own alcohol to Dubai with us and we took it out with us in water bottles each night as the alcohol overthere is so expensive, about \u00a38-\u00a310 for a standard glass of wine!!!! I know you are not suppossed to but we would just order a soft drink and add our own spirit, nobody even payed any attention! We managed to save atleast \u00a3200 by doing this. The rooftop bar is really nice to sit at night. There is alittle building work going on next door but it never bothered us and as you will see the whole of Dubai is a constant building site and will be for the next few years atleast! It wasnt noisy and didnt affect our holiday at all. The staff were all really helpful, especially the guy who works at the pool. He is like your own personal butler, laying your towels out for you and is very freindly and helpful. A little tip is to not take the hotel taxis. They approach you when you come out of the hotel and tell you to get it and i would have gotten in if i hadnt been warned previously. They charge you a fortune!

The daily supply of mineral water and the coffee and tea making pot was appreciated much, as well as the two available cards to open the room and for electricity.

The position of the TV was not optimal for a room with twin beds, the system for lighting turn on/turn off was not very well designed. For example the turning on/off of the lamp next to my bed should be done from the other persons bed...There should be also more variety on toiletries offered.

On my first visit it was faultless, the staff and in particular room service couldn't do enough and the room had all the complimentary items as you would expect 'topped up' every day without fail. This time around, room service was way below the standard you'd expect from a four star hotel and was not brilliant. We stayed 8 nights, on at least 5 of the days I had to call housekeeping to arrange for complimentary coffee / milk / water and on one occasion we had no bath towels!! Just poor room make up.

No shuttle service but taxis are cheap. There is also a metro station in the Mall of the Emirates (snow dome etc) 5 min walk away - its ideal. There is also a metro station just outside the hotel and should be open in a month's time. Much cheaper to eat in the Mall of the Emirates than the Hotel - Hotel restaurants minimum meal price is AED100 (\u00a318.00) per person. Mall of Emirates AED120 (\u00a320) FOR TWO!

We booked directly from the hotel website for a reasonable price including breakfast. I had stayed at the holiday inn chain before at Singapore and somehow expected a similar experience here. Check in was smooth. Our room was on the 6th floor. I had booked the most basic room ( my mistake!). The room was extremely small, with almost no space to move around. So small that it was hard for me to take a photograph of the entire room! The window faced Sheik Zayed Road and we had a nice view of the Burj Al Arab Hotel. The bathroom was clean and the shower was good. There was no iron/ironing board by default in this category of rooms and we had to request housekeeping to supply us with one. I would think that an iron would be one of the basic amenities available in any hotel of this class. The breakfast menu was similar on all 3 days that we ate there, barring changes in 1 or 2 dishes. We did not use the pool, but I peeped in to see how it was. The pool is situated on the terrace of the building and was really really small. That was the smallest pool I have ever seen and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone who would want to use a pool during their vacations. The staff were friendly throughout the stay. I was given the wrong bill during checkout and had to point that out before the correct bill was given. In the end I believe I got what I paid for in Dubai.

We checked out after our third night because of what i would consider an uncomfortable feeling in the bar area ( drinks were not allowed in the lobby area ) . I'm not a prude - but it was too blatant. We were in several other bars and did not find this problem.

The Mall of Emirates is just a 5 min walk away (10 min in the 45 degree heat), Jemeriah beach 10 min taxi ride away, Dubai Mall 15 min taxi ride away. Plus taxis are absolutely everywhere and cheap, so you will have no problems there. The hotel has a gym and pool on the rooftop, restaurants are are also available, although we only ate in the Royal Buddha once which was really nice. The bar staff do a lovely Strawberry Daiquiri cocktail, but there not cheap and cocktails are not included in the happy hour which runs from 12-7pm. The staff were really friendly and couldn't do enough to help us, they were always making sure we were o.k, suggesting ideas on where we could go or what we could do.
