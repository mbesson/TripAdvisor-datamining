The bar is really friendly and a great place to meet locals and travellers alike. We had a room in the attic (en-suite) and yes the stairs are steep and narrow but this is not unusual in Amsterdam especially the old part. Our room was a decent size and has everything you need for a short stay (we stayed 4 nights). It was reasonably clean but very dark and dreary, everything was painted a strange shade of green. It is a good choice for younger people because it's cheap compared to other hotels in this area, we are in our fifties and managed the stairs with no problems. It does get noisy of a Friday and Saturday night but wasn't so bad that you couldn't sleep. Would I stay here again?

The bar is small and cute and the bartender was nice. The stairs up to the rooms are interesting but also pretty dangerous because they are so steep. Pack lightly if you plan on staying here. We entered the first floor landing and my first view was of some half naked guy laying in bed smoking with his room door wide open. The smell of smoke and sweat coming out of there made me want to gag. We got into our room and I was slightly shocked. My poor husband immediately apologized. The room is in desperate need of a refurbishment. The carpets are old and dirty, the furniture is old and beat up. There are dirty marks and dings all over the pukey colored walls. We had to share a toilet and shower with the other people on our floor. I had to clean urine off of the toilet numerous times and the toilet always smelled like urine - probably because the men staying there were pissing all over the place. The shower was reasonably clean. It was quite warm in the room so we had to keep the window open. There is constant noise coming from outside that goes on 24/7. The location was good because we could walk to all of the attractions, however, there were many shady looking characters in the area who would make lude comments to us to get our attention to sell us drugs. The restaurants in the area mostly consist of kebab type shops. The bartender let us leave our bags at the hotel on our last day until our flight in the afternoon. We still had a great time in Amsterdam despite the dodgy hotel. Next time we travel in Europe, we will paying extra to get a nicer room. The cost was still high in my opinion for staying in a place where you were scared to walk on the carpet without shoes and didn't want to touch the wall beside your bed with any part of your body! We went home with bug bites which I hope to hell weren't bed bugs. We kept our bags out of our room and washed everything when we got home. I don't know how this place gets good reviews.

We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve stayed in a variety of hotels and are familiar with hospitality standards in Amsterdam. I travelled with my partner, and two friends. We stayed in the top floor of Hotel Internaational for four nights. Both rooms have an ensuite \u00e2\u20ac\u201c one of which had a jacuzzi bath. We had read many positive reviews on this hotel and we were looking forward to the visit. The hotel is marketed as a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcbudget hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 so I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting much. Just hot running water, a good shower and someplace comfortable to sleep. Unfortunately the hotel offered none of these. We paid extra for an en-suite room which we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use. The bath/Jacuzzi did NOT HAVE ANY TAPS and had to be filled with the shower head. This took nearly a long time. When it eventually was filled the hotel manager told us it was leaking into the room downstairs. After the first night we did not have hot water in the mornings. The Hotel Manager told us to wait 20 minutes and try again. But there only seemed to be hot water for showers in the evening and night times. The general feel of the room was that it was in desperate need for repair. The furniture was worn and tatty and one of the chairs was broken. The curtains had fallen down and were \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctied\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 onto a string. The carpet had also seen better days. The double bed was two \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcguest beds\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 (similar to what you might have stored away at home), set into a wooden box with a mattress on top. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t very comfortable. On the positive side, the room was quite large. Smoking was allowed in the rooms and the Hotel Manager and the cleaning lady were all very pleasant and welcoming. The Bar downstairs is really cosy and had that \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcold-world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Dutch feel to it.

Room size: Small but big enough. The room contained a bed for two, a sink, a wardrobe, and a desk. Cleanliness: The room and bathroom were clean. Since smoking is allowed in the rooms there is a definite strong marijuana odor. The 2nd story room is nice since you can leave the windows open to air it out. Bathroom: Bedroom has a sink with mirror. The single shared toilet on our floor was in its own small wc. The shared shower is in its own room. The shower room has only one shower but is large enough for multiple people to fit if you want to save time ;-). The shower room is lockable so you basically are showering in a private room. Great water pressure and plenty of warm water. Location: This hotel is in a great location above a bar. It is maybe a 5-minute walk from the main train station (though it took us about 30-minutes because we got lost so pay attention!). The hotel is right on the edge of the red light district as shown by the red lights that pop up out of the ground right in front of the hotel at night. We did not take any public transportation while in Amsterdam. We walked everywhere (Anne Frank House, Van Gogh Museum, etc.) in roughly 30-minutes. Miscellaneous: Stairs up to the rooms are very steep, almost vertical. Since the hotel is above a bar, you check in with the bartender (who was very nice). Annoying alarm would beep in the hallway every time we would exit our room at night to use the bathroom but it would turn off after a few seconds. Free wifi.

The stairs are crazily steep but traditional for this type of house and the room wasn't plush by any stretch of the imagination. But the bed was comfy enough and the sink in the room made dealing with the shared bathroom easier. Towels were supplied on the first day. The room wasn't cleaned during our stay but that's perhaps because we weren't awake when the chamber maid did her rounds. To be honest we had late nights and late morning so we never had to queue for the loo or shower. If you've ever hostelled you'll find this place better than a hostel, if you haven't hostelled you'll find it a bit rough around the edges. No complaints at all. Perhaps take your own sheets just in case you're a little more used to your own comforts than others may be.", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cumbria, England", "Title": "\u201cBrilliant!!\u201d", "Author": "chrisbutler83", "ReviewID": "UR10036182", "Content": "This hotel is cheap and cheerful!

The city's famous Dam, its even more famous Red Light District, and its well organised station (Amsterdam Centraal) are literally two walking minutes away. Furthermore, the hotel is surrounded by half-British-half-Dutch Pubs, Asian restaurants and Take-Away desks, and nice little restaurants. Therefore, there is little to complain about 85 EUR during the season or about 65 EUR off-season. Just don't expect any service. The rooms - though not really spacy - are clean, sheets are fresh, bathroom etc. with no problems, and you get even a small TV with both local and international programms. However, as much as the hotel's surroundings with its bars and pubs are a plus, as much they are a minus as well: it's terribly noisy there, as the old houses close to one another take up every sound. Particularly on Friday and Saturday nights, the busy area will take your sleep until the early morning - and from the early morning on, lorries with their delivery and Amsterdam's cleaning crew will keep you awake anyway.

I will be staying here for probably the sixth time (each time for 3 or 4 nights) in Feb 05, and I can safely say i have never had a bad time here. As for rude staff, this is ridiculous you normally get back what you put in, if you catch my drift. The bar downstairs is a public bar of the traditional (Brown Bar) standard and is a great place to start off your night. Directly over the road is a wonderful little Chinese greasy spoon type place, where tourists mix with locals alike, it is very reasonable and the food is simple but good, plus with it's favourable loaction you cant go wrong.
