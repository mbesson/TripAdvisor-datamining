It is basic and simple, I was in a single room with shower and sink and the toilet was shared but clean and not used by many people. Breakfast was perfect and the waitress, as the girls at the reception, was very kind. The room is cleaned every day. Good value for money as the location and service are very good. When I wil go back to Berlin I will choose this hotel again! Berlin is a wonderful city. I would never expected that it was so amazing. I stayed only 2 days, but walkin and walking and walking I have seen almost all what's to see!!!", "Date": "October 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "SE England", "Title": "\u201ccheap\u201d", "Author": "liveandletlive", "ReviewID": "UR82084533", "Content": "Fairly close to the centre of Berlin.

The hotel is a five minute (if that) walk from the nearest U-Bahn station Reinickendonrferstrasse with just one change at Freidrichstrasse to get there from Schonefeld airport. We experienced no problems seeing all of the main tourist sites despite the hotel not being slap bang in Central Berlin. Whilst the decor was most certainly stuck in a previous era and not up to the Hilton's standard it only proved to be of amusement to us and did not detract from the great value deal we had obtained. The staff at the hotel are incredibly friendly and the gentleman who checked us in was very knowledgable about all the tourist activities and had taken the time to mark his favourites on a city map for us. We stayed in room 118 which was spacious, clean and with a decent bathroom with shower. The room's best feature would be its balcony which looked out over the hotel's breakfast courtyard and the gardens of neighbouring residential homes. The buffet breakfast was excellent. The choice was neverending for cold meats, cheese, savoury and sweet spreads, choices of cereal and lovely fresh rolls. If like us you had an evening flight they are more than happy to keep your luggage locked away whilst you go out looking for one last Berliner Pilsner! We would not hesitate to stay here again.", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weimar", "Title": "\u201cPerfect for some days in the capital\u201d", "Author": "mrpunkrock", "ReviewID": "UR19734042", "Content": "As we got the hotel for a very low rate (52 Euro for a double-room) there is nothing to complain about it (especially compared to our other option a double-room in a hostel which would have been 10 Euro more). People are nice. Our room was really big. It is a 1 min. walk to the next tube station, and a 3 minute ride to find yourself right in the middle of Berlin. Some minor things did not work as intended, but that is something i don't really care about in a city-vacation, where the hotel is just a place to sleep. We didn't have breakfast, as this would have been 8 Euro per person more, and you can get great breakfast in Berlin for 16 Euro elsewhere. Overall, for the hotel was a budget and perfect for our needs.", "Date": "September 4, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Graf Puckler", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d257018-Reviews-Hotel_Graf_Puckler-Berlin.html", "Price": "$51 - $133*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Schonwalder Str. 21</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">13347</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "257018", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/86/7c/867c63a0445f49d22e02baac75bb1c911large.jpg"}}
