Good Service.. Ok place to stay.\u201d", "Author": "DnDAmsterdam", "ReviewID": "UR124549471", "Content": "So let me just first start by saying. That we arrived in Rome on the 1st time in 50 years the snows had hit the city. But as we arrived with the snow coming down. We were able to contact the folks at Royal House. The cab had a bit of a time finding the place as the entrance to the hotel is on the side of the Royal Bar, Cafe, and Restaurant. We were brought in and show our rooms right away with one of the guys carrying our suitcases as we carried the baby and the baby wagon up the stairs. Let me say that not having an elevator is not that big of a deal as we were going to be walking the city in a Borjne but it is good to know for people with hip issues little kids or just lazy in nature and do not feel like climbing stairs. When we got into the room. We were quite impressed with the size of the room, furnishings and the Bathroom was massive...... I had a bidet but no bath. With the size of the bathroom it would be good if they decided to add the bath. But still did not detract from the room as it had towel warmers and heated floors. It had high ceilings with a very comfortable bed. A little firm for my wife's taste but in my book the firmer the better. The bed was a Queen size with quality bedding and the room had a tv and nightstands. Now there were a few quirks that made me and the wife think this was more like a BnB and not so much a full blown hotel. 1. Room service - was walking downstairs sliding the door between the hotel and restaurant and talking to to restaurant staff and ordering meals up to your room. The nice thing is that the hotel guests got a 20% discount and they delivered it to the room. 2. Not to many frills but was very homey and friendly. Devoid of the rack of information located in the lobby. But the staff was great for local knowledge. We were so tired on the first night we did not notice the dull thud and bump of the bass from the discoteque that we did on our second night. Additionally, the vibrations from the tram outside could distress light sleepers. But I truly was not overly bothered or woken due to the tram or the bass. Then again I live in a city and it is par for the course with city living. The breakfast was good I will call Italian continental. Grape Juice, Sweet Bun, platter of meats with fresh bread.... To be honest when told the bread was fresh it did not have that chew you would get from fresh bread...More like day old. But not being picky with a < 100 Euro room. The rooms were cleaned every day. Very clean well made beds. My only complaint is that there would be a scent of heavy smoke depending on when we came back for the day. I am a smoker my wife is not and my baby is Definitely not! Sp I can understand the smoking in the culture but when running a business do it outside the rooms or maybe the building. The only other thing I would find to be a little of a let down was that the door with the high security dimple key was always open. Either the latch was thrown intentionally or it did not catch at all. I come from a security background so that was a personal pet peeve for me. All in all this place is a gem. I am nit picking a little. But these are things that people should know about. The location is perfect, The view is fantastic and the restaurant is damn good to boot. It is a good fit for couples and friends maybe not the best for families.... But I would go back with mine...

I won't go into the good points since they have already been covered - it is mainly the location. However, you expect a little more than what this hotel provides given what you pay for the rooms. Let me point out a few other items that might be useful for people trying to decide on this hotel: 1. The beds are really uncomfortable. The mattress was terrible and they did not seem to be of the standard length (My feet were sticking out and I am only 5' 10\") 2. The air-conditioning is not adequate for the room. It never used to cool down the room even though it was running continuously - and this was when the outside temperature was not too bad 3. The bathrooms are fairly small and grungy (expect Motel 6 standards) 4. There are no elevators 5. The roof top restaurant that they show on their website is closed indefinitely 6. The breakfast is very frugal/ almost non-existent. At best, you can hope for a good cappuccino.", "Date": "October 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cWouldn't stay anywhere else in Rome!\u201d", "Author": "Mackenmj", "ReviewID": "UR118239527", "Content": "I have just come back home after spending a whole week at this gem of a hotel. The staff were fantastic, they were approachable and friendly and ready with tips of what to see other than the Colosseum, Roman Forum in the immediate vicinity. St John of Lanterne is a 15min walk away (Bishop of Romes's Church - the Pope), the Holy Steps are nearby as well, then there is the a hidden gem in St Clemente Church only a couple of blocks away - here you see the excavations of a 12th and 2nd century church under the existing one. The hotel room was large and spacious. I was in 101 and had a great view of the Colosseum. Air conditioning was fabulous. The bathroom was also spacious and as a larger person I actually found the shower size adequate. I ate at the hotel restuarant the first evening and the food was mouth watering. You do receive a discount once they know that you are a guest. Location to the Metro is only a 5min jaunt down the road. Taxis are close by. Buses too. I walked alot around Rome and found it comfortable walking to Vatican City, Piazza del Popolo etc. You can't go wrong with this hotel. Tip: If coming in by train. Once outside the station turn immediately left and walk to the traffic lights. Cross the road and head for where the outdoor restaurants are. Royal House Hotel (Royal Art Cafe/Restuarant) is on the actual corner.

I was looking for a triple and came across an old review of this hotel. I was not able to find many other reviews, but I decided to take a chance on it anyway. The location is perfect for touring--directly across from the Colosseum. The view from our window was fabulous! We were in room 203, which had a queen (not for sure of this size) bed with another bed which appeared to be a futon which had been folded out to full size. The room was a little cramped with both of these beds in it, but it was definitely doable. Loved the bathroom...very big with ample space for toiletries, and a nice-sized shower. My only disappointment could be in the breakfast. They only had cold cut meats and cheeses and juice on both of our mornings, as both mornings we were too early (8:00-8:15a) for the croissants which they stated were in the oven. The staff was very nice and accommodating. (We only ordered a pizza late one evening while sitting outside looking at the Colosseum in all its night-time glory, and it was just OK.) It had a bit of a bed and breakfast feel to it, as it was small and intimate. There is a taxi stand less than a block from the hotel, so very convenient.

Literally opposite the Colliseum and just 5-minutes walk from the Colosseo Metro station. Other interesting tourist sights (e.g. Forum, Arch of Constantine) are very close too. Nice big room. Comfortable bed. Big bathroom with bidet. Small but adequate shower. There are two floors of rooms, all very nice I believe. No noise whatsoever. Excellent aircon. CONS This is not advertised as a hotel on the side of the building. It says \"Royal Art Cafe\" on it, and it is mainly a cafe/restaurant. So don't expect taxi drivers to know where it is if you say \"Royal House Hotel\". Best thing is to get to go to Colosseo Metro station (if single traveller, otherwise take a taxi.) It is on Piazza del Colosseo - although my taxi driver even pretended he didn't know where that was!! Make sure you have a Google Map printed. No elevator, so not good if you have mobility issues.

I didn't see any of the other rooms but I do think that we had the best one in the hotel. The breakfast was nothing special but it was enough to keep you going till lunch time.

I have already reccomended this hotel to friends and family and if I ever returned to Rome I would like to stay here again! We didn't eat in the resturant as it was quite pricey and there were little cafes just arround the corner that were loads cheaper.

I feel lucky to have discovered it. It is not listed on any travel website I could find, you have to google search Royal Art Cafe to get the website and book it. I found it by doing a google map search of hotels near the Forum - I couldn't believe how close it was to the attractions of Rome. The pictures on their website looked nice and the price was very reasonable, so we took a chance on staying four nights at a hotel with very few reviews. Glad we did, as this was a good choice. The hotel consists of 6 rooms that are above a busy, popular restaurant directly across the street from the Colosseum. It was a large room with wood floors, large comfy bed, huge bathroom, separate table for sitting/dining, closet space, and a window with a fantastic view of the Colosseum. This place is worth staying just for the view. Catia was our main contact, and she was very helpful and polite. Breakfast is served downstairs in the restaurant and is included in the price, although it was a little skimpy. We received a 20% discount on all other meals at the restaurant, which was very handy for both quick pizza lunches and long relaxing dinners. Wireless internet access is included if you bring your laptop computer. There is no public computer provided. The metro station (Collosseo) is about a block away, a quick walk from the hotel. You can get all over Rome very easily without a car. It's worth noting that all of the other hotels in the area that have even a minor view of the Colosseum or Forum charge a fortune, and this place was *very* reasonably priced. I am sure it is because the restaurant is their big money maker that pays for the staff and building, the hotel portion seems like an afterthought.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": ".", "Title": "\u201cLovely little hotel and restaurant next to Colosseum\u201d", "Author": "tas_home", "ReviewID": "UR10948608", "Content": "In the autumn last year I enjoyed a pizza in the restaurant outdoor.There was a fantastic atmosphere so close to the main attraction Colosseum.
