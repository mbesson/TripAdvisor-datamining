London is an horrifically expensive place to stay in, the price quoted for Holiday Inn or Travelodge was twice the price of this hotel. All I want when I visit London is a place to stay that is clean and quiet and at a reasonable price. I am not looking for frills as I am out visiting relatives and enjoying what London has to offer. The hotel has obviously had a make-over to make it appear more modern looking. The room had a larger than kingsize bed which was a bit firmer than what I normally like, the pillows very flat but I suppose you could request more, and the sheets were clean and of good quality cotton. The room also had a TV which worked, a mirrored table with hairdryer - most important, and a shower stall which though had DIY repairs of the tiles was clean as clean, with a shower head which had plenty of pressure. Also included were cheap but useable hair & body liquid sachets along with soap, and plenty of spare toilet rolls in under sink cupboard. It also had a fridge (unstocked) which annoyed me with its noise, but that was easily remedied by switching it off at the wall. The staff were friendly. I didn't have breakfast as I took that elsewhere. The hotel is only a ten minute walk from Kentish Town tube and two mainline stations.

I tried to look for something moderately priced, which in London is not an easy task. I can't say we were totally surprised to find the hotel rather disappointing, but it's never fun to be right about such a thing. For the price we paid (92\u20ac/night) it was not worth it. The room was seriously tiny, even for London standards. We had 3 large suitcases, which we needed to stack on top of each other just to be able to go to the toilet or open the door. Bathroom was big enough though, nothing to say there. What was the most disturbing aspect was the noise-level. We were on the street side, so this might not apply to the rooms on the other side of the building. I could not sleep without earplugs on. And that is a lot to say coming from me. We needed to have the TV on about top volume if we wanted to watch something as the noise from the street was constant. Other complaints: the pillows were a joke, our room got cleaned only about 4 times during our stay (shouldn't this be every day, it is called a hotel after all?) and the breakfast was nasty. Location -wise I don't know why anyone would stay there, as it is not central, nor even in Camden. We stayed because we were moving a just a couple of streets away after our week's stay.

The hotel it's self was ok. Not something you'd rave about but considering we'd taken a 10 hour coach ride from Amsterdam overnight, as long as it had a bed it would've done us fine.

I paid \u00c2\u00a360 for a small but clean, comfortable and warm room in the 2nd building owned by the hotel. The hall stairs and bedroom had newly laid wooden floors.

Yes there are taxis, buses etc but just bear the distance in mind. Ok for a few nights - not so good if you want a base for exploring Londons sights because of the distance to the tube.

I was pleasantly surprised that the hotel was very clean and comfortable, nicely decorated and in such a good location. Although the tube station is a bit of a trek away there is a bus going to King's Cross just around the corner so it was easy to get to and from the hotel. The room was a bit small but perfectly comfortable and was provided with tea and coffee facilities, a hair drier, a safe, flatscreen TV and showergel. The walls were very thin so the activities of the neighbours was very audible. One thing to point out is that there was no lift, and it was odd that the hallway light was always out when I left the room and had to feel about the wall for the lightswitch- if it is on a timer surely it should also be motion sensitive to avoid accidents? Breakfast was nothing special but did the job- a buffet of cereals, toast, cheese, cold meats, juice, tea and coffee. All in all a good hotel- excellent value for money in this location.

I had to lug my very heavy suitcase up to the 4th floor. The rooms are incredibly tiny. There's just enough room for the bed and a desk, not much else. I'm constantly tripping over my things because there's not enough room. The room is always too hot, so you have to leave the window open and endure the wailing of ambulances which constantly race by on the street. No tub and the shower height adjustment is currently held together with electrical tape. The shower is so tiny that even I, at 5'5\" and 140 pounds felt like a giant. Large people will not be able to enter this shower, that's how small it is. There's no \"Do Not Disturb\" sign and despite telling the desk several times not to enter my room, they did anyway. There are no fire sprinklers or fire escape to get out of what would essentially become a barbeque pit in event of a fire. And finally, the Internet service was extremely poor because they have not engineered it to reach all of the rooms. If you are totally on leisure and want to save some money, this is the place to be, but if you like amenities or need to get business done, this is not for you.

Generally it looks clean but there was a layer of dust on the TV and in the wardrobe of our room.

The water pressure was almost non-existent from the sink but luckily the shower was reasonable. Sleep maybe possible if you take a room in the upper levels - we suffered from people going outside to smoke at all hours (and I mean all hours as the last crowd finally went in at around 03:45). The room doors have a nice gap a the bottom so the light streams into your room when someone walk down the corridor - and speaking of that, we had a drunk shouting at the top of his voice at 05:15. Breakfast starts at 07:30 which was our alarm clock due to the continuous sound of tables & chairs being moved around on the upper floor. Breakfast was sparce and described by the person showed us to our room as \"continental and not much\"! There is very little room to squeeze between seated person on the 6 available tables.
