First, the location, right on Montparnasse Blvd so there is a limitless choice of eateries right outside the door. And if you turn left out the door and walk aways down the street, there will be a nice view of the Eiffel Tower. There is also a shopping mall across the street. A metro stop is also right outside the door as well, so beware of foot traffic. The room is small as to be expected, but clean and cozy, with free WiFi. The bathroom is the real surprise as it is quite large for a room that is small. The room I stayed in had a shower and tub. There is ample room for toiletries to be put out either in the sink area or on a wall shelf. The bed was comfortable with rather soft linens and extra pillows. The only negatives and they are minor: need better lighting in the bathroom as it\u2019s only in the sink area rather than overhead. The tub wall is high, so short people like me, have to be careful getting out of the tub. I wouldn\u2019t have minded a small coffee pot in the room either. I like a cup of coffee as I\u2019m getting ready. I had a room up high on the 5th floor and toward the back so most of the noise was not evident. But you can still hear the metro rumblings. I bring earplugs when I travel, so this was not a problem. So ask for a back room if you can. I usually put on the fan in the room if not the a/c for \u201cwhite\u201d noise, but that was not working as the hotel switched to heat, which I didn\u2019t use.

Great deal on hotel website for about $130 USD per night. We were prepared for the small rooms, which is typical of Paris hotels (unless you're spending $500+/night to stay at the Ritz). Stayed with a girl friend, we had a twin room. It was very clean and had a great view of Blvd Montparnasse, with a small balcony (room 55 is one of 4 rooms with balconies). Room was very quite when we shut the French doors, noisy when doors were open and we did NOT notice the train. Bathroom was gorgeous and quite large for the room size. Best thing about this hotel is the location-you are in the middle of the action and it's a short walk to the Latin Quarter, etc. We took the Air France bus from CDG for 16.50 euros which drops you off at Gare Montparnasse. If you have a lot of luggage the short walk to the hotel can feel like quite a hike. We took a taxi from hotel back to CDG for 50 euro, it was worth it for 2 people. We stupidly ignored the previous reviews about the overpriced breakfast and got it the first morning--it was a joke, definitely not worth it. Cafes on either side of front step of hotel serve much better breakfast for much cheaper. Hotel staff was outstanding, all of them. The supposedly cranky black guy written about in previous reviews was very nice to us on a consistent basis. Staff went above and beyond to help us locate things like laundromat & health club, both of which were right around corner (printed out maps and schedules for us). The elevator was small but not that small. My friend and I are both big boned 5'9\" and we fit in it just fine, went up one at a time the first time when we each had 2 large suitcases.

We looked over attractive rooftops and it was indeed tranquil and we slept well. Good beds. In the rush to leave I left my little box of jewellery in the room by mistake. When I got home and found I'd lost it I was upset as it contained items of great sentimental value. I phoned the hotel and they found it, returned it in an SAE and charged a modest amount on my credit card for the stamps. They were so obliging and helpful and senstive and I was immensely relieved to have my precious aide-memoirs returned to me, quickly, efficiently and with courtesy. For this I shall be forever in their debt and would recommend them heartily. Also, although noisy, the hotel is right next to the Montparnasse Bienvenue train station, near to the trendy St Germain quarter and very convenient for most of the sights of Paris.

Based on the reviews we read, we were really stressed, but our stay could not have been any more pleasant! Our room was very small, but very clean with comfortable beds and excellent storage. The closets and shelving were thoughtfully laid out, and made it easy for us to put all of our American sized luggage in to our French sized room. The bathroom was newly renovated, equipped with nice bright towels and soaps. Everything was spotless! Great waterpressure! Cool summer nights had us sleeping with the windows open and we weren't bothered at all by the street noise. The front desk man said the rooms facing the back of the hotel entrance were quieter, which was consistent with our experience. The price was great for the room, but I'd skip the breakfast. It's pricey, and there are great bakeries nearby at which to grab a little something. Be sure to be adventurous and at least TRY to communicate in French at the hotel and surrounding establishments.

It was my first time and after lots of research and reviews on Trip Advisor I selected the Hotel Edouard VI which is in the 6th district called Montparnasse. The location was excellent. The metro was literally in front of the hotel. Montparnasse Train Station was just up the street within a six minute walk and so many buses pass through Montparnasse Square that transportation was easy and readily available to go anywhere in Paris. Catherine at the front desk was most helpful with all of my many questions. She works most days and chances are if you call, you'll get her. She's a treasure! Tell her Rob from Room 41 sends regards! The Hotel's phone number is [--]. Their website is [--] I had read about the small rooms in Paris hotels so I was prepared. I stayed in Room 41 which is in the back of the hotel. No special views, but it was quiet and pleasant. The room rate was 156 euros or about $210 per night. I was travelling by myself with just a carry-on so I didn't have much luggage. The room was great for me. For two people with two large suitcases, it will probably be tight. The room was well-appointed with a very large, modern bath with shower! I had called prior to arrival and talked with Catherine about making sure my room would have a shower. There was a refrigerator stocked with drinks. I didn't bother with their drinks, but this was a nice place to keep a bottle of water. There was a modern computer screen for the television. Most of the stations were in French, except for the BBC and CNN. I didn't watch much tv, but it was nice to have for the weather reports. The room had air conditioning with very easy controls! The hotel had a lift! I was on the 4th floor and after a long day of sightseeing, it was wonderful to take the lift upstairs! I did not sign-up for their morning breakfast as it was too much fun eating at the cafes. There was a public computer available in the lobby at rates competitive to the Internet cafes. I did not experience any hassles or inconvenience at this hotel. I don't believe my experience was unusual. The Hotel Edouard VI is a clean, well-run hotel and I would definitely stay there again. I give it a very high recommendation.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Romford, Essex", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel!\u201d", "Author": "fieldmills", "ReviewID": "UR7702772", "Content": "stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, the staff were nice, room was comfortable and cleaned every day. the hotel itself was in a good location with lots of nice cafes and restuarants nearby, the metro was handy and we used this alot. only a short walk from Jardin des luxembourg and its lovely there, we ate our lunch there a few days and the birds actually take the bread from your fingers, but some times they get a bit over friendly and you have to watch the rest of your sandwich! would definately stay at this hotel again, and recommend it to others. love Paris, this was my third trip and my boyfriends first, we will both be going back again!", "Date": "May 27, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Quiet!\u201d", "Author": "KDavidsonColorado", "ReviewID": "UR7294801", "Content": "My husband and I stayed in room 47 which faced the courtyard.

The negatives: headboard in room smelled musky and you can smell others smoking if there are any guests smoking on the same floor (i used a towel to stop the smoke from creeping in through the doorway). The positives: GREAT location right next to the metro: Montparnasse Bienvenue (lines 12, 4, 6, 13), breakfast was good (coffee, tea, milk, OJ, fruit salad, a basket full of baguettes, croissant, chocolate croissant, cereal), staff spoke English and was very nice and helpful! Next time I go and if I was on a budget like I was on this trip, I wouldn't mind staying here again just because it was close to many things.
