A budget hotel ideal for a short stay. I only needed a place to sleep on a stopover in Singapore. Yes it's small etc, but that's what I was expecting so it wasn't a concern. There is NEVER an excuse for dirty, filthy unkept rooms however. The bathroom was covered in mould and the floors obviously had not been cleaned for a long time. The rooms smell like cigarettes but that is to be expected I suppose. It served it's purpose but for SG$80 a night, it should be clean at the very least.

Upon entering the rooms, there was this rather strong, unpleasant smell of cigarette smoke filling the air, i thought it was just me but my wife in the next room also said the same thing. For the next 2 nights, i was woken up by my asthmatic attacks and had to take my inhalers (which i brought along and had not been used for quite a while); most probably triggered by the cigarette-smelling air in the room. On Day 2, noticed that the TV in my room (405) was unable to view a number of channels that were available in room 406; made a complaint but they were unable to fix that problem. At the same time, the air con in my room stopped working and I was relocated to another room ( 111 ) which was bigger. Room 111 had the same problem of strong cigarette smell and the bathroom emits a rather unpleasant odor (however TV channels reception were similar to 406). Although 111 was a bigger room, but it had no windows (imagine being in a confined space with unpleasant cigarette smell lingering in the air) ! On Day 3, we left the hotel for an outing at 1030am ; got back to the hotel at 630pm and was informed that room 111 was not made up yet ! We left again for dinner at 8pm and I had to specifically remind the front desk to get the room done before we got back around 10pm (not impressed!); however it didn't happen again on subsequent days. There was no free parking or discounted rates provided for guests; parking is provided at a basement carpark in the next building at a rate of 80c per hr (7am -5pm) and SGD2 per entry (5pm - 7am) ; which would total up to SGD10 per 24hrs (if the car is just left parked there) Food outlets were aplenty within close vicinity of the hotel and especially Halal restaurants for Moslems ; which was the reason for choosing this hotel.

Unless you really have to. I booked the hotel for 3 nights upon arrival on 14th and upon the 2nd night i was told that i had to leave the room! reason given that somebody else had reserved the room since 1st of July and the system wasn't showing the slot on the computer so i wasn't told on the check-in date! So they offered me another 2 rooms with no windows that would have ended up much more expensive for me and my family! so we just checked out and spent our money on a family room at Fragrance Hotel for the last night which was much cleaner and had a great service. Location wise it's not exactly the city center nor it is a prime location but at least is close to public transport. However, in Singapore, where ever you wish to stay is close to some sort of public transport. Some rooms don't have windows that can be really depressing so make sure you get a room with a window if ever. Payed around 130 sqd per night for a family suit room but that's even considered expensive in regard to the location, comfort and service quality. I finally ended up in Fragrance Hotel Emerald down the same road and it was much cheaper for 89 sqd per night for a family room.

We pre-booked and reserved a room for late arrival. This was confirmed as a Superior Room by the hotel. We arrived at about 01.00 and checked in and were shown to our room. It was the worst room we have ever had in a so called reputable hotel chain. The room was so small there was no room for our luggage on the floor; you couldn't get into the bathroom if the wardrobe door was open; the mattress was covered in a plastic sheet which meant all the bed clothes slipped off; although it was meant to be a no-smoking room the place stank of cigarettes; there was no window in the room. The room was nothing like the photos on the web site. Being tired after a long journey we slept as best we could for the night but in the morning complained to the manager. We were told they had no better rooms but for an extra charge we could move to a sister hotel virtually next door which, as we had paid for 3 nights was the best we could get and were told that we could complain later which we did. When we complained we were told that there was nothing they could do as we should have complained the night we checked in and despite our protestations the management refused any refund at all. We later found out that this is what is commonly called a \u201cshort time hotel\u201d catering for ladies of the night and their clients. We have since written several times to the Managing Director of the Hotel 81 chain but not had the courtesy of a reply. If you want an hotel in Singapore don\u2019t book the Hotel 81 Classic; it is awful and without doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed in on our travels.

The rate was SGD79 nett per night flat - no weekend surcharge imposed since I was staying for so many nights i.e. 10. The room was very spacious for a hotel that is in the budget hotel category - about 200 square feet, which is close to twice the size of what you'd get in some budget hotels (remember: real estate in Singapore is among the most expensive in the world!). Getting from Changi Airport to the hotel by taxi took some 15-20 minutes, and cost SGD14 (including SGD3 airport surcharge). Room was clean, and was serviced every day. Did not notice any cigarette smoke odor, and if I recall correctly, smoking was not permitted. The hotel's location in its immediate vicinity is excellent - near a main road bus stop (with buses going to Orchard Road, Chinatown, VivoCity, amongst others) and also a MRT station (Paya Lebar). Also nearby are various eateries, including a hawker centre (where meals can be had for real cheap!). Also nearby, at Joo Chiat Complex, is a supermarket, which is useful for those who want to buy beer, drinks, snacks, etc. - that's where the Deluxe Room's mini-fridge also comes in handy!
