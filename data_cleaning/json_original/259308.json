The staff was okay. Nothing too comforting or helpful. The front door was actually locked past midnight, which is a bit outrageous since the bars and restaurants seem to close even later than that! You can buzz into the front desk though, but t is just a bit inconvenient. The breakfast was alright, as was the coffee. Free WiFi only in the common area on the first floor.

The safe in the room was locked but we didn't need to use it anyway. The flooring was laminate so no dirty carpet. The paintwork on the walls could do with a touch-up in places.

The room was small, which I had anticipated, given: a) this is Rome and b) the price. However, the service at this hotel is seriously lacking. You must climb stairs in order to catch the lift. The wi-fi connection works every now and then. At one point, I went down to the reception as I had to send an urgent email and the internet was not working; the girl at the counter very rudely told me the internet was working and that I should try to connect at the dining area (which is next to the front desk. Only she said she could not turn on the lights, as the on switch was on the second floor... I don't think I need to clarify that this was not the case at all... My room had a leak near the bathroom sink AND had roaches. When I went down to the reception to complain, they said they would \"send someone right away\"... at 1am? I don't think so... I immediately asked for a room change, which I got, only to trade the roach infested room for a disgustingly moldy scented room... lovely! And the carpets in the room seem to have never been cleaned, just touch them and wash your hands... you'll see all the dirt wash out. The A/C being restricted to certain hours of the day is also extremely irritating. They do, however, have few accommodating staffers, such as the young girl, who I'm guessing is the owner's youngest daughter; she was always very polite and tried to help out with directions on a couple of occasions. As well as a very kind Italian woman who does the housekeeping. She even tracked me down to let me know I had left a few belongings after having switched rooms in a hurry. Also, the rooms have a tiny safe to store valuables. There is an advisory in the room that states that the hotel is not liable for goods stored in the in-room safe, and that for better protection, you should leave your goods in the hotel safe. So I decided to leave a few items at the reception to put in the hotel safe while away. When I returned, I asked for my belongings at the front desk and there they were, right next to the receptionist. In other words, there is no hotel safe, which they didn't bother to let me know, even though their signs clearly indicate otherwise. Overall, my stay at the Hotel Paris was a very unpleasant experience.

Again the room was very small and narrow. It's my guess that most of the rooms will be very small and somewhat dark. Overall, the Hotel is looking a bit 'well used' although the rooms while not spotless, are clean. The good bits? The location is great, just a short walk to the Trevi and right in the middle of lots of restaurants.", "Date": "October 12, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cYuk\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2841333", "Content": "Stayed here one night only and we were glad it was only one night.

The room was the tiniest we had throughout Italy--literally had to walk sideways between bed and wall. Bath was small, but both rooms were clean. They had not turned on the A/C yet so we had to keep the windows closed to keep out the noise--thank goodness it cooled off enough at night. Breakfast was a buffet of breads, toast, juice, and coffee.
