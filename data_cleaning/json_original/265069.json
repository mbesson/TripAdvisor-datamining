About the best thing I can say is that it is central and close to all the main sites including the Rail Station and the Duomo which is just down the street, after that it all goes down hill. Getting there is a nightmare and you have to park round the corner in a private car park. It's expensive but then inner city parking always is. My advice would be to leave the car and get in on the train. You can't use it once you are there anyway. We found the staff unfriendly and unhelpful. The room was quite the worst I have ever stayed in with no window to speak of, certainly not one that you could look out or one that gave any natural light to the room. The furniture was old and tired though the bed was comfortable enough and the cleaning staff worked miracles. The bathroom was awful with a tiny bath the surface of which was peeling and stained. The plug was missing to both the bath and the sink.The shower hose attached to the bath worked but there was nowhere to fix it and no shower curtain though that didn't matter because once in the bath you could not stand up in it anyway as there was a low beam in the way! Tiles were cracked, different colours and had grout missing. When we complained they said Ah room 58 is like that and they had no others available. Breakfast was poor with nothing warm and not even the ability to make toast. At \u9227?05 for the room per night, it was without doubt the worst value for money hotel that I have ever stayed in.

As long as I am comfortable and the location is ok then I am satisfied. My husband and I hated this hotel. We hated it so much in fact that it ruined our stay in Florence. Where to start? All but one of the reception staff were either rude or indifferent. Our room had bugs squashed all over the ceiling and walls and was located underneath a set of squeaky stairs that seemed to be a main thoroughfair all night! The room was incredibly noisy. The sewerage system had some contraption attached that made an almighty noise whenever the water or toilet was used that gave you the fright of your life. Breakfast was an awful experience - the woman who ran the breakfast room was rude and inefficient. There were dirty plates all over the room and there was not enough space for the amount of guests staying in the hotel, meaning you had to wait to be seated every morning. We were expecting some mail to be arriving while we were there and when it didn't come we asked if it could be redirected - the answer was just 'no'. No discussion. Horrible horrible hotel. I am unsure why there are some good reviews listed. We too read the good reviews and ignored the bad. A mistake. Do not stay at this hotel.

Within minutes of entering Room 40, my wife and I realised it was one of the most dire hotel rooms we had ever seen. The old damp patch and resulting peeling wallpaper and general glumness of the room rang alarm bells. The mildewy grout and dilapidated condition of the bathroom and musty smell made us look at each other in alarm and then the broken air conditioning finally sent me back to reception to request a room change. I was offered Room 31, which looked acceptible and my wife and I carried our luggage down the stairs and settled ourselves in. We were then told that we could not have this room after all and had to heave our luggage right across the hotel to Room 69. The bedroom was ok, but had squashed mosquitoes on the wall. The bathroom was mildewy, but at least had no smell. However, the shower tap looked a bit 'dodgy'. Two nights later, after a sweaty day's sightseeing, the tap came off in my wife's hand meaning neither of us could shower. Another trip to Reception was met with 'Its not my problem' and the offer of another change of room the following day. My wife and I were not offered any means of cleaning ourselves that night even though I stressed that this was our key concern and had to use wet towels standing in front of the sink, washing our hair by sticking our heads under the tap. We investigated three rooms the following morning, one of which had a disgusting bathroom, one a window which didn't shut, smelt damp and had a massive dip in the mattress, and the third was similar to Room 69 (not surprising as it was Room 67, almost next door to 69!). However, it had the most awkward and peculiar bath and shower combination I have ever seen.Both Room 67 and 69 inadvertently gave us light displays every evening as the lights either did not work, or did not work but later flickered into life, or did work, only to flicker out of existence.Every night we had to chase mosquitoes out of the room. The breakfast was hardly evident and when I wanted to complain to the manager, or duty manager when the shower in Room 69 broke, he was unavailable and uncontactable by phone, even in event of an emergency according to the receptionist, who obligingly tried to contact him (or her) by phone. The location of the hotel is excellent however, near to the train station and landmarks. The bed linen and towels were changed every day. The young lady in reception and the man that looked like Bryan Ferry were very helpful and cheerful. It is a pity that not all of the staff on reception were the same.However, from my experiences there, I cannot recommend it! We had the misfortune to have booked for 7 nights.

Phone didnt work well, wake up call never rang in and we missed our train the next day. The showers were nice though a piece of the shower was missing and we had to call the front desk to come up and fix it. After she told me no one could come up for 3 hours i yelled at her and 5 mins later front deks came up and fixed the problem.

Hotel Martelli was terrible. We hated it there and could not wait to get out. We booked a room before going to Florence at San Giorgio  Olimpio Hotel in Florence.

The front desk man said something in Italian to another worker who told us that they would escort us to another hotel. We did not like the idea of this. We got there, which was Hotel Martelli, and it looked awful. It was filthy, the woman was confused, and it was so old and depressing. The room was worse. The shower was big enough for a 10 year old, we had no hot water, not towels, and the tv was broke. We stayed out as long as possible so we did not have to come back. We left the next day for Rome.

The room had a bath tub with courtain and a shower (the one every european hotel has that looks like a telephone). The floor of the room was really cold (the outside temperature was around 45?F) and the heat just didn't work at all. I made the complaint at the front desk but the lady in the reception (the old one) told us to turn the buttons on and the heat surely will turn on; we tried and we suffer a really cold night.

We suffered the room for the first night and asked to move the next morning. After a short discussion with the receptionist she did agree to move us. The first room she showed us was not a lot better than the first and had a bad smell in the shower, the second room was OK, so we settled in.
