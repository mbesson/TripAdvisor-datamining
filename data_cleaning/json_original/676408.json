Nice breakfast in a nice club room. did not try lunch or dinner but there are free drinks at night which made up for the upgrade price. Spa was small but massage was amazing.

I can't, however, figure out why \"high end\" hotels need to nickel and dime (or dollar) you at every turn. After all, I stayed for a \"special\" conference fare of $259, much reduced from the more typical $300+. Much less expensive places (but still nicely appointed in good locations) have free wireless, at least for priorityclub members, give you a bottle water or two when you check in, upgrade your room when they have availability, and have a decent business center where you can access the internet and do some limited printing. Don't look for any of this at the InterContinental SF. In your room, a bottle of Fiji water will cost you $6; I don't even want to think what they might charge for an ounce of gin from the mini-bar. Wireless in your room is $15/day, business center is standing only with substantial charges just to log on and print a few pages. (At least you can print a boarding pass for free). Parking is insane -- $59/day once you add in the tax. I was briefly afraid they would charge me for the little plastic bags that they gave out for umbrellas when you came in out of the rain. The lobby and bar area is small and very noisy ... and you can't avoid it since it's right in front of the elevators. The breakfast buffet at Luce is excellent, lots of fresh fruit, traditional breakfast fare (I liked the genuine maple syrup), etc. Just like everywhere else, have an open wallet attitude. The buffer will set you back like a typical dinner entree -- $28. The plus side is easy access to the Mosconi center. My trip was for a conference there. Also, the staff at the hotel is extraordinary. Friendly, helpful, always smiling, ever attentive -- they embody what one would hope all hotel staff would strive for. I expect you will be treated right if you choose this hotel. Overall, the hotel is not a bad choice, particularly for business trips that involve the Mosconi center.

We absolutely did not venture out at night. Touting LEED and \"green\" is cliched and pushing the limits at times. The towels were wrinkled, thin and did not look clean. I cut three fingers on the sliding glass bathroom door (glass is not a good idea for a bathroom, as is the lack of a fan for privacy). There were no functioning windows and we kept joking that a fire truck was going to pull up outside our window all night, even though we were on the 23rd floor--needs some noise control. We had a lovely room service dinner, but when we finished up our water, I noticed that the drinking glasses were filthy. Other pet peeves; no urn of coffee in the lobby to grab and go early the next morning, no free Internet, lack of room outlets, no mirror in the room for grooming, telephones that require a PhD to utilize; not to mention the annoying advertisements flashing on a 6\"x4\" telephone screen and no Sunday newspaper.

We had a perfect stay and I highly recommend this modern and very clean hotel! My husband was in SF for a conference and I came along with our 5 year old and 1 year old. We arrived very late at night, exhausted and bedraggled. (The kids had been crying. My husband lost his cell phone at the airport. We got lost trying to find the correct train. Couldn't get out of the downtown train station with all our luggage b/c the elevators had been locked so had to drag kids, stroller and suitcases up the stairs. Yes, THAT kind of day.) The lady at the front desk was SO sweet to us. When I asked if we could possibly have a high-up room so my daughter and I could experience the city view, she upgraded us to a better room on the top floor at no extra charge!!!! She was also very kind to my two young children, giving both of them little stuffed sea lion toys and coloring books upon arrival. Wow, this really made our difficult travel day all worthwhile. More than that: it made our whole trip extra-special. Really, the great room was a highlight for me and the kids ...and you should have seen the smile on my face when I saw the room. Let me tell you, the view was magnificent! The room itself was beautifully decorated and spotless. The long dresser and desk plus multiple tables meant there was plenty of room for unloading all the stuff you accumulate when traveling. Lots of lighting options were a bonus, too, so I was able to dim the lights perfectly at the kids' bedtime but still leave enough light for myself. The bathroom had a nice, quiet sliding door which I loved, but this was in a handicapped-accessible room, so perhaps not all rooms have that. Large walk-in shower, spacious bathroom not like some hotels where there is hardly room to turn around. We loved the large vanity space, which leaves plenty of room for toiletries. Excellent lighting. The shower was incredible! The beds were about the most comfy hotel beds I've ever slept in. I spent many hours in the evenings after the kids were asleep just enjoying the cushy bed and drinking in the stunning view. The walls appear to be nice and thick: I never heard a peep from other people around me. We particularly loved the Keurig machine with easy-to-use coffee cartridges and quality coffee. I drink a lot of coffee and also had friends come up to the room for coffee a couple of times, so I went through a lot of those cartridges. I called several times to the front desk to request more of them and they were so courteous and always rushed them right up. Months later we still joke about how we miss that machine! Room service was, like all big city hotels, very very very expensive. But I did indulge a little and was delighted with what we got. Fresh, fresh, fresh. Quality ingredients. Large servings. I recall I had white bean garlicky soup with sourdough bread. Not only was it out-of-this-world delicious, the serving was huge, a complete meal. I also ordered a decadent chocolate dessert, but I was so full after the soup and bread, I saved it for the next day! The fresh fruit plates were similarly, extremely well-done and very generously sized. I ordered sandwiches and milk also for the kids and, okay, I never want to pay that much for PBJs and milk again! But on the other hand, upon our arrival we were too exhausted to go out again, and for the price it wasn't too horrific: huge glasses of very cold milk, large sandwiches on very fresh bread. All gorgeously presented with white linen and shining silverware and fresh flowers. The splurge was worth it in my book, for a once-a-year treat. I did not like the mini-bar. It is nothing but a pain when you have little kids who constantly want to open it up and take things out. Also, there was only a tiny space in there for our own stuff. But I can live with that since many other business-oriented hotels do the same. Another complaint: having to pay a daily charge for Web access. Really, it should just be free with the room in this day and age. But, again, virtually all big city hotels do the same, so I can live with it and we did pay for the convenience a couple of days. Another thing I didn't like: the tv was a huge-screen HD, which was awesome - the kids were mesmerized by it, lol! But it always seemed to revert automatically to the pay-per-view option when you turned it back on. So then you had to punch buttons and scroll, scroll etc to get to the regular, free tv channels. Argh. And it was very slow, several seconds delay to change channels. Does this bug anyone else? I'm not a big tv person anyway, but it was annoying to me and I imagine it would annoy others as well. The only service glitch we had was that the crib we had requested in advance took a while to arrive. First the front desk said they had no record of that request, but would send one up. Well, I waited and waited (and by then it was extremely late at night) and in the end I had to call the front desk and I think the message had gotten lost along the way, so they requested it again and eventually a crib was delivered to the room. By that time, my exhausted toddler had fallen asleep on the bed. No big deal, and the front desk staff were very apologetic. These things happen. I did not try out the restaurant, bar or gym - having two little kids certainly restricts how much of that you can do, unfortunately, but everything was buzzing and looked great whenever we walked through the lobby. This hotel is not huge on the ground floor. Not a con from my point of view, but it does not have the opulent, soaring, huge lobby that you'll see in some mega hotels. Just thought I'd mention that. The Intercontinental staff were without exception courteous and helpful and friendly. We used the concierge desk once, getting advice about taking a sightseeing bus tour. The woman who helped me out was amazingly friendly and made it so easy for me, even taking care of the booking for me so that all I had to do was turn up at the bus stop at the right time. Nice - I was very grateful. My little ones were meanwhile rolling on the floor and trying to bang on the spotless windows etc all the while I was talking with her and everyone was so nice, smiling at them and generally being very tolerant, which as a mom I appreciated very much! Must mention, of course, the location is awesome. The hotel was a short walk from all the shops, the conference center, the playground, just a bit further to Chinatown and to the water.

The hotel itself is nice in a big convention hotel sort of way. But the communication and remedy of bad situations is not good. We checked in and decided to pay for a club room. The room was small and had only a little window instead of the floor to ceiling windows advertised. We changed rooms to a regular corner room which was spectacular. But there were boxes left from the prior guest on the desk, minibar bottles missing and at 11 PM we discovered that the blackout curtains were not functioning. (not good for an east facing window!). I let management know and the boxes were removed and the curtain fixed at midnight. We barely slept that first night because the mattress felt very lumpy. The next morning I requested that the mattress be changed. They don't have any spare mattresses on this enormous property! So they removed the feather-bed and it was much better. Still, I'd expect excellent rather than mediocre mattresses at an intercontinental. The wifi didn't work, and I called to let the front desk know. There was nothing they could do. When we checked out, we were billed for the minibar and the wifi. There were no notes about our complaints and management did nothing to make it right. I had been talking to my boyfriend earlier, assuming that the hotel would do something (buy us breakfast, apologize, or something) to make things right. He asked whether I was just trying to get something for free. I thought about it and explained that no, what I wanted was the opportunity to leave the hotel thinking good things about it instead of negative ones. When things go wrong, a hotel can make it right with small compensations that don't cost them much if anything. But this hotel did not. Not even having a record of the problems and having to bring up the minibar and internet situation at checkout was disappointing.

I never did get breakfast. This is a disappoinment since the last time I stayed here I thought this was a great hotel, but it's been downgraded.

As before, every staff member was gracious and attentive whether we were in the lobby (concierge & doormen), the Club Lounge, or the restaurant, Luce. Luce, is an example of what we especially enjoyed on this visit. We had heard it had received a Michelin star for the third year in a row, but we were delighted that the prices were comparable to other restaurants. We kept hearing from guests in the Club Lounge (more about the Club below), that the butter-poached lobster was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153fabulous\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (two guests had it two nights in a row) as well the John Dory, and other items. During our stay, we savored and can highly recommend the lobster, the John Dory, the diver scallop and abalone appetizer, the sweetbread ravioli and a soup with celeric, apples and coffee ice cream. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll write more about Luce under restaurants since it was such a positive experience. The hotel location was great, as always, but it was even more important to be so close to all of the tourist sites and public transportation because of the new, higher taxi costs and because I could get everywhere I needed to go with my sprained foot. We had a terrific corner room with floor to ceiling windows and a great view of the bay, the city, the Bay Bridge, and the New Year's Eve fireworks that were visible down at the end of Howard Street. **Recommendation: stay on a high floor with a better view; the corner rooms are the best. The Club Lounge, an oasis within the hotel, was even better than before. Although the food has always been delicious, it seemed there was increased focus on providing healthier, attractive appetizers that are more in line with the food served in Luce. Along with the assorted veggies and dip and cheese and crackers, there were freshly prepared treats such as tuna tartar along with additional cold items. One night, lobster claws were included. For the hot food, highlights were skewers of fish filets and some with chicken breast: neither had any breading or batter. The assortment was different every evening. Each time we passed through the Club, there was something to eat and beverages to enjoy: breakfast, soup-midday, teatime, evening appetizers and drinks, and then dessert with liquors. **Recommendation: upgrade to the Club for a more memorable, tasty stay. We made some great friendships with other guests and shared travel tips, too. Finally, one of the most important reasons why we stay here is that everyone always welcomes us (and everyone else) and they want to ensure that we have a wonderful, memorable stay.

ID#: 122893276 This is a little late and long, but I stayed at the ICH SF July 20/21. My reservation was booked by a travel agent and when I checked in I was given a single room. I showed the desk agent my print out that showed a King room. This particular agent was a little confused on what to do as they were very busy that night. Non the less the agent was a reasonable person. However the adjacent agent listened into our conversation and said \" do not give her an upgrade\" repeatedly \u00c2\u00a0without actually knowing the conversation. ( I had a confirmed king room....). As imagined this upset me and I asked for the manager. She came out of the back office and asked the problem. I told her that the adjacent desk agent was rude, snooping in our converastion and said specifically and repeatedly \" do not give her an upgrade\". I do not think this is proper customer service for a front desk agent at the caliber of a hotel. The manager then said to me \"oh no, no, she did not say that\" ,also repeatedly. I asked the manager how she as the manager \u00c2\u00a0could tell specifically what the desk agent said. The manager was in the back while this conversation was going on,.... it was like I was talking to a robot with prerecorded answers that were not relevant, it blew my mind. After every time she said no the agent didnt say that I asked her how she knew what was said- as she was far away ain the back and not part of our conversation.... Fast forward I go to sleep and in the morning after showering I tilted my head up to put eye drops in my eyes and I noticed the entire bathroom ceiling was covered in sticky oil/resin- almost like drops of honey waiting to fall. Failure on the ventilation system and old paint. YUK! When I checked out I told them about it and how the whole expreience was well below what I expected from this chain of hotels. (This gets better keep reading) That same morning around 9:30 am I get a call from Shehani De Marseille, Guest Services Manager, telling me she understood I had a bad stay and being very appologetic. \"what can we do for you\" she kept saying. \"Can we credit your bill some amount?\"- \"NO my room was paid by work - what good does that do me, the one who had the bad experience\" I responded, \"Can we give you a free night?\", \"Yes if its another property not this one\". \"We can only offer you a stay here\", she said. \"No, thank you, nice gesture but I have no interest to stay at your SF property after last night and the room condition and thats too bad because I come to SF every week\", \"We really want you to come back and experience what a stay should be like here at this property\". \"Well since I am up all the time, I could do that...\" Shehani said she would send me an email confirming the free room and assured me that this experience would not happen again. What I got was an emails few days later thanking me for the conversation and only offering me a room upgrade.... what a liar! And further wasting my time and letting me down again.

I booked this hotel at the last minute on Hot wire. The price was $212.00 per night. Hotwire rates the hotel a 4.5 star. So comparing prices with Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons (2-2..5x the rate), i thought okay 5 stars for 500+ per night, or 4.5 stars for $212.00 per night, thought it would be worth a try. The room was clean and big for the city. I was impressed with that. The hallways had no odor and i was impressed with that as well. The room also had modern decor. and The food was good. Things i did not appreciate were as follows: 1) Upon Arrival - waited in line for 15 minutes to check in. There were only two people in front of me, so the wait was ridiculous. 2) I had the valet park my car, and did not want to take it out again. So i asked the doorman for a cab. Well few cabs visit the hotel , lets say that. After 25 minutes waiting, i asked if there was a house car. We were only going to Mortons Steak House for dinner, about 2.5 miles away. The doorman offered me the house car. I took the offer. Well upon arriving to Morton's 5 minutes later, i was charged $25.00. One the way back from dinner, i grabbed a cab and was charged $6.10. So i did not appreciate being gouged by the house car driver. House car rides are generally tip only, and they should have told me in advance. Basic feel is that if you want five star service , definitely do not try a 4.5 star rated hotel. The hotel was decent value for the price, and the location was not bad.

I'll start with positives: 1. Large clean rooms with floor to ceiling windows. We had a corner room with great views of the city. 2. Large modern bathroom with plenty of towels 3. Comfy bed! I slept very well after getting barely any sleep at a Courtyard in Santa Rosa the night before. 4. Quiet... The past few hotels we've stayed at were the \"historic\" types with very poorly insulated windows. While charming and cute, Intercontinental was a welcomed change, mainly because I was able to sleep through the night without being awoken by traffic, fire tracks, constructions, partygoers, etc. We were on 11th floor and I did not hear a thing, even though we were staying there on a Sunday night with traffic starting early on Monday. 5. Coffee lovers rejoice! Intercontinental actually has real coffee machines!! I was delighted to see a Keurig machine in our room. I love a cup of coffee in the morning and don't usually drink hotel room crapoffee. I had great morning packing while sipping on some \"Parisian Nights\" Keurig coffee. 6. Helpful concierge - we got excellent dinner recommendations and general info on several occasions. Now onto the negatives: 1. Water pressure in a shower - simply a joke. 2. $59 hotel parking........ I don't think I need to expand on this. Although, the valet did give us a self-parking option (across the street) for $33 without in/out privileges. Gotta love San Francisco. And last but not least, a few words about the hotel location. This could be the sole reason why I would never stay here again... Let's just say that the hotel is in a still developing SOMA neighborhood. Translation - streets are filled with homeless people. And as someone who lives in LA, I'm used to homeless people. But SF homeless are more aggressive... and it just seems like they are everywhere. So I wouldn't suggest going for a stroll around the hotel, even during daytime.

The concierge was especially helpful and overall, when we checked out, we had nothing but positivity in terms of our view of the hotel experience. This all changed as we checked out, we were informed by the member of staff at the front desk that we had a $70 charge for drinks from the mini-bar. We hadn't consumed any drinks from the mini-bar and disputed this with the member of staff. Additionally, we explained that in fact the day before a different member of staff came to our room to check the mini-bar and found that we had consumed nothing. We suggested that the room be checked as well as the stock, this would confirm nothing had been taken. Eventually, the lady at check out agreed and said they would not charge us any money, we requested a receipt from the hotel showing that no money would be taken and that we owed them nothing. The hotel provided us with the receipt which we currently have in our possession. We recently returned from our trip to San Francisco to discover that in fact the hotel had charged my girlfriend's debit card with the $70 without her consent. We had provided the card at check in which the hotel pre-authorised, as indeed is commonplace at most hotel chains. We had not signed any bill or receipt to confirm it was ok for them to take the money, which indeed we didn't owe them in the first place. Basically, this is at best a very poor mistake, at worst, outright theft and indeed fraud. We have e-mailed the hotel and have yet to receive a reply. My girlfriend has reported the transaction to her bank as fraudulent and we will be helping the bank with their enquiries by providing the receipt from the hotel showing there was no money owed on our account at the time of checking out. This shocking behaviour from the hotel has left us with a sour taste in the mouth after what was a fantastic trip. We're all for paying our own way, however a hotel charging a card without authorisation from the card holder is deplorable - especially as we had not consumed anything from the mini bar. The check out staff at Intercontinental should be aiming a lot higher to uphold the reputation of the hotel itself and the wider brand. If this was the action of one rogue member of staff then appropriate action should be taken. If this is broadly the policy of Intercontinental hotels, I seriously suggest that you don't stay at any of their properties.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cClean and Modern Rooms, Friendly staff.\u201d", "Author": "WorldTraveller674", "ReviewID": "UR122869218", "Content": "We stayed here twice in the last month in December over Christmas for 3 days and again for 1 night in early January.

My only complaint is that they charge for wi-fi. For a brand new, state of the art hotel, especially one that already charges so much, wi-fi should not be extra.

I had written the hotel ahead of time asking for a quiet room away from interior and exterior noise, and we were given a south facing room on the 25th floor. It was wonderful. The floor to ceiling windows made it feel like we were resting on a cloud. I thoroughly enjoyed just sitting in the window looking out over the bay and rolling hills.

The TV was wall mounted with all the cords in the wall and an actual high-def feed. The sitting chair and ottoman were comfortable and cute. The bed was super comfortable, and the room was quiet. The bathroom was very big and open with all of the towels, etc. stored under the counter. The hotel provided and extensive range of toiletries. The ice bucket was a lovely stainless steel rather than brown plastic. I could go on and on, but everything was just a touch nicer than what I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m used to. The maid service was also great, and our room was cleaned almost immediately after pushing the button requesting maid service (they have a cool button to press rather than the card to hang on the door).

From the moment I saw how nice the outside was, I knew the inside would be nice. We were greeted and checked in by Jason. His professionalism was great and was very helpful in asisting us. We checked in our room without any problems. We received a phone call from the front desk verifying that everything was ok with the room. We had a room on the 26th floor with a city view. The room size was nice. There was also a window seat that was pretty nice although I didn't use it. The bed was very comfortable and the linen was soft. The hotel has a concierge service which was extrememly helpful. LeaAnn and Brian (concierge service) were very helpful and friendly with asisting us with directions and places to dine. Earnest, the doorman was very cool, funny and down to earth and also helped us with navigating the city. Chloe and Jasmine at the front desk were also nice. Shoutout to Al for helping us with our pictures. One advantage this hotel has over others is the zipcar service. Prior to traveling to San Francisco, I was told about zipcar. That is the most convenient option ever!! The Intercontinental actually has zipcars based at the hotel. That saved us hundreds on a rental car and parking fees. I also noticed there were always chauffeurs on ready at the hotel garage. The hotel is a short walking distance from Union Square, Market St. etc. The Westfield Mall is right around the corner. I also liked the(1 location of the hotel because it wasn't congested with tourist. We were always greeted by someone whenever we left and returned to the hotel. Jason even remebered my name a few days after had last seen me. You can take the Bart from the airport to Powell St. and you will be about two blocks (10 min. walk) from the hotel. My wife didn't want to walk with luggage from the Bart station to the hotel so we caught a cab. The cab far was about $4.50 both times. It will only cost you $8.10 each was to/from the airport. That is cheaper than a cab and those shared van rides. I read and post reviews on trip advisor like others and it's been a great help for preparing for this trip. I think the main two complaints I read were parking fees which were about $50-60 a night and internet usage for about $15 a day. Well I solved those issues quickly. I bought my laptop and tethered from my cellphone for internet usage. I signed up for zipcar and used the service while we were there. $7/hr for car usage? You can't beat that!!!!! The hotel is the only one that has zipcars stationed there so you don't have to go find zip car locations. There is a link on the Intercontinental website for a special for the zipcar signup. That also took car of the $50-60 parking charge so there it is! The only thing I would have liked to have seen was a tub/shower vs. shower room only. Kudos to the entire staff at Intercontinental San Francisco for their professionalism and prompt service. We will definately return to this hotel if we visit San Francisco again.

This is the second time we tried the Intercontinental on Howard Street. The hotel is less elegant and serene than the Mark Hopkins. It is situated in a crowded area by the Convention Center close to the Tenderloin district. The first time we stayed, we were impressed by their friendly front desk and their willingness to accomodate our needs. When we wanted a weekend getaway, we decided to try them again. When we checked in, we were met with an efficient, but unyielding clerk who was unwilling to give us the room and services we needed. I was ready to move to another hotel when Janet, another front desk person, took over. Janet went out of her way to get us a beautiful room similar to the one we had on our previous visit. Her courtesy, efficiency and tact restored our faith in the Intercontinental brand. The service we had this time was comparable to the outstanding service we received at the Amstel, Manila, and Bali Intercontinental; it was top notch! I highly recommend the corner rooms on the higher floors for a panoramic view of the city. The floor to ceiling windows give the rooms a spacious, airy feeling not found in the regular rooms (which are mediocre at best). The buffet breakfasts are quite tasty, but they are not quite as delicious as at the Mark Hopkins! I missed the eggs benedict on Sunday morning! Parking rates here are as exorbitant as at the Mark Hopkins, but here there is a parking lot across the street which is much cheaper, but it has no in and out possibilities at night. We had free parking with our package deal which made things much easier. One advantage of the hotel is that it is around the corner from great shopping and that it is right by the Chieftain, a great Irish pub, should one require a tasty libation or some Irish stew cooked in Guinness! For anyone daring to venture into less desirable neighborhoods near the hotel, there are superb Thai restaurants nearby.

After a 16 hour flight from Melbourne to Los Angeles and a long drive up Interstate 5 (our onward journey after SF was to Burning Man Festival and we had collected our van from LAX), heavy traffic on the Bay Bridge meant that we didn't actually arrive at the hotel until 7:30pm, well after their 3pm check-in time. We had valet parking included in our rate, which was for a king room with two walls of glass promising great views over San Francisco (fog meant we probably wouldn't have seen much anyway), and after handing over our van we were greeted by a nice enough gentleman at front desk. He informed us the room we had reserved was not available yet due to the hotel's loyalty program, which includes 4pm check-outs, and that loyalty member had been in the room that day. That is all well and good, but by 7:30 one would think housekeeping would have had ample time to service the room - the gentleman invited us to enjoy two free (standard) drinks in the bar. Nice sentiment, but after our drive all we really felt like was a shower. He showed us to a table and promised to get back to us regarding the status of our room. We would have been in the bar for 30 minutes before we decided to go outside to get some air. When we came back inside the man who was helping us was nowhere to be seen, so we took a seat in the waiting area by the concierge desk in full view of the front desk area. The hotel's lobby and bar area are vast, but we thought sitting in such an obvious place we would be recognized and helped out. After waiting for about 20 minutes, to no avail, I approached the front desk to see if anything had happened. I explained the situation to the lady, and she had no idea what I was talking about and barked at me to see my ID. As someone who works in the hotel industry, I was in shock as to how this woman thought she had the right stuff to work in a frontline customer service role. My initial patience about the situation turned to rage. She said they had a room ready, which in no way resembled the one we had reserved, and although much larger was on a lower floor with views of the concrete buildings surrounding the hotel. I snatched the room keys and stormed off. From my point of view, the initial check-in experience dictates to a great extent the overall enjoyment of the stay, and our experience pretty much sunk the ship before it even left port. The room we had been \"upgraded\" to was large, with a beautiful big bathroom that we loved, but somehow the trial we went through getting there had sullied the entire experience. The staff at this hotel need a lesson in internal communication and a major rethink of their approach to customer service. Maybe we just got hit with a double whammy of two people completely frazzled by their jobs. The excuse they gave us for our room not being ready basically said to us, \"our rewards members are more important than you and your $400 is meaningless to us in the grand scheme of things\". I don't see how a hotel can expand their customer base when they are sidelining potential new members to pander to their current ones. We are both really patient people and this experience turned us into fuming messes.

The hotel is up to the Intercontinental standard with nice and spacious room and an elegantly designed lobby, bar and restaurant area. The people at the front desk are helpful and take good care of the guests. A couple of things make me not want to return to this hotel though. First of all the area around the hotel is not great. Their are many homeless people around the hotel and on the way back to hotel I walked one block too far and tried to cut back to the main street but had to walk through an incredibly sketchy street with drug dealers and junks - this street is about 2-3 minutes from the hotel entrance. Good thing it was during the day. Second of all, the WiFi is 14.95 USD a day. This might be one of my pet peeves but I think that any hotel at this level should have free WiFi included, possibly with a premium paid service. Lastly, the bellman was not very helpful when I asked him where I could get a quick breakfast and return within 40 minutes.

My only complaint of the rooms would be that the beds are soft, so if you like your beds soft, you will love these. For me, they were too soft and I woke up w/a little back ache every morning, but with all the walking we did, I still managed to sleep very well. We used the pool and hot tub all but one night. The pool is nice, but is a lap pool, not a play/splash pool. It would have been nice if there was a play pool, but so be it. If you happen to go while there are lap swimmers, playing is not appreciated. We were able to play some of the time and it worked out well as my girls ended up swimming laps with me the rest of the time -- which they found rather fun! The hot tub was nice after long days of walking! I did use the fitness center twice and it was nice sized with newer equipment, television, towels and water. The concierge (don't remember his name) was nice, but I had done enough of my own research - thanks to TA - to know where I wanted to go for meals, sights, etc. We never ate in the hotel as there was always business people in suits and such at the lobby bar and restaurant. We always ventured out and about to the local eateries as there are so many great options!! Yes, parking is an additional $52 (we flew in) and WiFi is also additional (which we didn't get since I can find everything on my phone! :)).

Both Avis and Hertz are close to when you need a rental car (I sincerely hope you not will rent at the Hertz station around the corner at Marriott - they are so rude there). Concierge service is top notch. They arranged everything prior our arrival in the best way, however they was really busy up-on front. I recommend to take the city combo tour with Alcatraz when you are here, they pick you up just outside the hotel. Had a spacious Club Room at 33rd floor, with everything you need in the room to have a comfortable stay. View is nice from top-floors (even if I think that you can get better views at other hotels since the neighborhood is almost only parkinglots and small houses). I'm glad I didn't had a room on lower level. Bathroom very nice and plenty of space, I like that it was both bathtub and separate shower. The Aromatheraphy amenities are of the best I have tried in a hotel. Overall well main tended and high standard. Club Lounge is a great value. They serve both breakfast that is amazing, as well daily soup for lunch, afternoon tea and hours devours in the evening. We didn't use the hours devours or afternoon tea but I'm sure it was as the same high quality as breakfast. Friendly service all over and check-in was very efficient. Large fitness center that was open 24 hours as well as a pool. Visit the spa, good treatments and relaxed atmosphere. But if you are a couple, it is boring, no space where you can relax together prior/post your massage treatments. Excellent room service with a lovely ice-cream I truly recommend.

It looks great, it is pretty much in the center of the city (easy access to everything), nice decor, super comfy beds, nice views, etc. BUT there were major cons that really disappointed. First off, I don't understand why no one has complained about parking. It's ridiculous. Overnight parking at the hotel for guests is $60 per night. When we asked about this to the valet we just got attitude and a rude backlash, \"Everyone pays for parking in SF.\" Really?! Yes, I understand parking is scarce and expensive in SF, but that is no excuse for (1) not accommodating guests who are paying a hefty price for the room, and (2) the unnecessary attitude. We parked one block away (off Mission and 5th) for 25/night. Another con was the room size. It was SMALL! But we could deal. What we had a hard time dealing with, however, was the snotty attitude of the person who checked us in and hotel staff in general. SO RUDE! We we were told we could do early check-in. Well, when we got there the guy checking us in was not friendly or inviting AT ALL, told us we couldn't check-in early and proceeded to tell us we were basically lying to him about having received approval prior. We were appalled (so embarrassing since other guests were standing around). Long story short, we eventually got a room. Throughout our trip, there were no greeters, people opening the door, etc. Everyone we came across just looked the other way. I don't think I would come back to this hotel (even though they have everything else going for them) solely because of the snotty, demeaning, rude service. It is completely unnecessary and we would much rather stay at a different hotel that doesn't treat their guests like lesser beings (and we'd probably pay less too).", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Metro Washington DC Area", "Title": "\u201cGreat business hotel\u201d", "Author": "KristinaR007", "ReviewID": "UR117379227", "Content": "Overall, a great experience.

The person who answered the phone said the concierge would be in at 11 am and would know, but I explained I was about to go out and therefore they asked another staff memeber who said no. I went ahead and booked full price tickets on line, but in Union Square that afternoon, saw a half-price ticket booth similar to the one in Times Square in New York.

We had free high speed internet in the Desert Rose Inn in the middle of the desert for a fraction of the price! Hotels still charging anything, let alone 15 dollars, for internet just haven't figured out in which century they are evolving. Basically, this means that for basic services such as parking and wifi, you have to pay almost 100 dollars per day in addition to the price of the room.

I'd always perceived the IC as generic, professional, and a tad boring - though in reality this also translates to a reliable, pleasant and comfortable choice. If you're after a cool vibe, strong and edgy decor, something quirky and unique to San Francisco, the IC will disappoint as too safe and bland a choice. If you're after comfortable rooms with a pleasant, modern decor in a very central location, with a spa, gym, indoor pool and jacuzzi, pleasant looking bar, separate restaurant, all accompanied by friendly and courteous service, you can't go wrong with the InterContinental San Francisco. (And unlike the sister property you don't have to scale hills to get there). The hotel has a corporate feel; being adjacent to the Moscone, I imagine it would be an excellent place to stay for business, meetings and conferences. The front office seemed to cope well with the high volume of guests when I was checking out, but the bellman's team seemed overstretched - the desk was unmanned and there were several full luggage trolleys in the lobby being attended to. Despite the rush, the team did notice me standing at the desk and I was attended to in a sensible amount of time. Having my own agenda, I didn't interact with the Concierge but I know the IC as a company pride themselves on their concierge service. I did not explore their dining and bar products (too many iconic SF places to fit in) but I appreciated the complimentary chocolates, fruits, nuts and water which were thoughtfully delivered.

This last time was only OK... not up to the Intercontinental's normal standards.\u201d", "Author": "RobandJohn", "ReviewID": "UR115057868", "Content": "We stayed at the Intercontinental San Francisco for a fifth time at the end of June. It had become our hotel of choice in San Francisco following several years of staying primarily at the W Hotel and the Marriott (which is now the Marriott Marquis) while on trips to The City. This was the 5th time in about a 2+ year period that we stayed at this particular Intercontinental and we travel to SF about 3 times a year. A few things this time may change the way we look at the Intercontinental San Francisco. First, we'd booked months in advance and had secured a deluxe room like we always do. The hotel has standard rooms, superior rooms (floors 14 to 24) and then so-called deluxe rooms (floors 25 to 30). What we ended up getting was a room unlike any we'd had before at this hotel... and not in a good way. We still got a high floor, but it was one near the end of the hallway that had a connecting door to another room. It was a much smaller room than we normally receive when we book this same type of room. There wasn't a single thing mentioned from the woman who handled our check-in at the front desk (i.e. \"Your room type isn't available so we are putting you in a smaller room\" or an apology or anything). When we went to check out, we looked at our bill and the room cost WAS reduced from the price we booked... so at least they did that. But some notification beforehand would have been the right thing for them to do, especially for someone who's stayed at their hotel numerous times recently. Equally bad, it was the first time at the Intercontinental we heard conversations coming from the people in the room next to us. It was obvious there were 2 parents and 2 kids in the room next door to ours. At one point, the adjoining room door was opened on the other side and you could hear LOUD giggling and laughing, plus the door on our side was visibly shaking like a big wind gust went through. It was beyond annoying. I guess as a kid it might seem like a funny thing to do, but it was off-putting at a 5-star hotel. One reason we stopped staying at the W in San Francisco was because of its thin walls, and it looks like we may have to do the same at the Intercontinental and look for another hotel. Some noise in the halls is fine and normal at any hotel, but you shouldn't be able to hear word-for-word conversations from the people in the room next to you. (Again, since it was the first time we'd ever noticed it at this hotel, maybe it was solely because of the adjoining room door.) A few times staying here, they've had town car service available to the airport, which is convenient and only a few bucks more than a cab. It wasn't available this time when we left but we never had problems finding cabs just outside the hotel. And there are many places to walk nearby (world class shopping, restaurants are all in easy walking distance). Avoid going towards Sixth and Seventh streets though because it can be a bit of a dicey crowd, particularly late night. We walked back to the hotel from Union Square after midnight Saturday night and it was fine. It may be a long walk for some, but it was enjoyable to us because we like to walk and explore San Francisco. The hotel does have some very nice employees who are friendly and helpful. Some of the valet guys are cool and talkative. If you're expecting great views of the city from your room, you won't get it by facing south towards the ball park. It's a pretty average view, even for San Francisco. The view towards Market Street is much better and we've had that view 2 times during our stays. One last thing... we're the type who don't really care if our room is made up or not, so we keep the lighted \"Do Not Disturb\" button turned on in the hallway. We checked in on Saturday at 3 p.m.... and had the \"Do Not Disturb\" light turned on Sunday afternoon about the same time. We got a note put under our door that said, \"We are respecting your wishes.\" That wasn't too annoying... but then we received a phone call from a man who said, \"Hello this is Security calling. We're calling to make sure everything is alright in there.\" OK, that was weird and a bit scary. It didn't sound authentic at all. We said everything was fine... but then we called downstairs to the front desk to ask if that was a legitimate phone call. The woman at the front desk said she didn't know... but then she checked and called back and said, \"Yes, security called to make sure everything was OK.\" That is just plain weird. If you turn your \"Do Not Disturb\" light on, should it really warrant a note under your door PLUS a phone call from security? We were trying to take a light nap after hearing all the noise from that family in the room next door to ours, yet we still got disturbed by hotel staff.

Hotel is well located, just 2 blocks south of Market street, near the Powell street BART station. The nightly rate is high, as expected for a 5 star establishment.

This is surprising, considering that the \"lower rated\" hotels within the Priority club range (for example Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn express) usually have free Wifi or internet access. Even the \"complimentary\" water in the room was not free (costs $8.50 plus tax). There is an electronically wired minibar fridge in the room which will immediately bill you for minibar charges as soon as you touched any item within it. We had bad experiences with this sort of minibar in previous hotels (We had to repeatedly go down to the main desk to report that we had merely \"touched\" the bottles, not drunk them, to get their charges reversed), so we did not even DARE to open this minibar fridge!!! We had buffet breakfast included in our rate but the breakfast was just average. Breakfast was not typical of a 5 star hotel. There were very little choices. There was not even an omelette and fried/poached eggs station. (Our breakfast experience at other 5 star establishments were better, with better choices, and usually a manned omelette station). To make matters worse, after we got home, we found out that we were only awarded 2000 priority club points for our stay, instead of 10 points per dollar spent. We would have got 10 points per dollar spent if we had stayed at Crowne Plaza or Holiday Inn instead! So, for all the money spent for 2 nights, NOT VALUE FOR MONEY.

However, the hotel's unscrupulous and inhospitable policy of charging for absolutely every single amenity in their rooms completely faded away our hopes of a pleasant stay in San Francisco. To begin with, in contrast to other 4 and 5-star hotels we stayed at during our road trip, the InterContinental was the only one who charged for the \"complementary\" bottle of mineral water, which, believe it or not, cost $8.00 + tax! I decided to drink tap water instead but to my surprise it took over 3 minutes to fill a small glass due to the poor water pressure. In addition, the hotel charged a ludicrous $15.00 + tax for WiFi, when this service is considered a free commodity in almost every small hotel or cafe. Secondly, the valet parking was ridiculously expensive ($50.00 per 24 hours + tax) compared to other near-by 4-star hotels, which charged at least 20% less. Lastly, the minibar, although stacked with a variety of somewhat premium products, had a sensor installed which detected if you took anything out and immediately charged it to your credit card. This totally offended us and made us feel as if the hotel considered us thieves, despite the more than generous premium we payed for our hotel room. Needless to say, I immediately started looking for other surveillance systems within the room. In all, my wife and I think its a shame that such a big and prestigious hotel chain with very deep pockets such as the Intercontinental needs to go to these extremes in order to profit when all they're doing is insulting customers and encouraging them to never come back, which is definitely our case.

The Intercontinental has a package deal which includes parking and breakfast at a very reasonable rate .

We were given a corner room which provided a really nice open feel to the room . The bathroom is huge with it's own floor to ceiling window . I looked in one of the regular rooms and it was the same as the corner room with the exception of the extra window space. Nice gym . Indoor lap pool. Oh yes, great beds. The walk to the Giants' game was less than a mile . Believe me , the cab hassle after a game is so overwhelming you'll appreciate being able to walk to your hotel. Can't get over how much the neighborhood has changed. We went to a day game , but would have no problem making the walk at night. Not only has the area really become very pleasant there are plenty of people leaving the park after a game so there's a real safe feeling. Hotel staff was great. Only one real complaint--- we had guests join us for breakfast once during our three day stay. Since our deal included free breakfast I had no idea what the cost of the buffet style meal was. My friends ordered two espressos with their brunch and the tab was roughly 95 bucks.

If you decide to take an airport shuttle from SFO the InterContinental is certainly one of the first hotels the shuttle will stop due to its location close to the highway from the airport. My first impressions were ok. The entrance is not very impressive, simple but elegant. Check-In was swift, but I got downgraded. I had originally booked an Executive Room on one of the top floors. They were not very apologetic about it and it was a little bit like: \"as a matter of fact we downgraded you\" To give them credit, they did agree to refund about $25 per night and I still had all the privileges of an Executive room such as Club InterContinental access and free Wi-Fi. BTW, the Club was great, the staff there were super friendly and even greeted me by first name. The breakfast is great and the afternoon tea there was also very good. After a long flight from Europe I was not in the mood to argue about the downgrade so I just accepted their offer. I went to my room and after about 10 minutes a cleaning lady entered the room. She did knock on the door but only for about 2 seconds before she opened the door. Good thing she didn't enter the room 2 minutes later since I was planning to take a shower! I do think that they should pay more attention to those little details. She obviously wasn't aware of the fact that someone was already in the room and wanted to bring a bathrobe which was missing. Apart from that, housekeeping was great, the room was 100% clean and the HDTV was just stunning, as stunning as my view. Unfortunately I did not see the Golden Gate bridge but AT&T park at night was nice enough. With the exception of the staff at the InterContinental Club I did not have much interaction with the staff, but everyone seemed nice enough. The location is good, not great though. It is a 15 minutes walk to Union Square and about 10 minutes to Market Street. The Embarcadero/Ferry Bulding is about 30 minutes away. One last thing I have to add: Upon check-out I had to explain (again) that I do not have to pay for the Internet fees ($60 for 4 days are OUTRAGEOUS) and I don't like to \"beg\" for things which were already agreed upon. Those minor flaws are the reason why this hotel only gets 4 Stars, it just wasn't perfect.

A shame - most hotels I have stayed in recently in US it has been free wifi for anything, anywhere in the hotel, and could cost a lot if staying for a while. The mini bar was OK with pretty standard contents and fairly hefty pricing. One of those autocharge ones - so don't touch anything unless you really want to use it. The breakfast buffet was pretty spectacular and my only disappointment was a industrially baked muffin on the Saturday morning (think it was eggs benedict sitting too long in the heater which was a shame) - but lovely fruit, cereals, bread and smoked salmon so cannot complain. The exciting find was the evening meal - in the evening the restaurant turns into the Michelin starred 'Luce' - absolutely AMAZING and not ridiculously expensive if you choose carefully - I had an astounding starter, delicious entree and lovely glass of wine beautifully presented for about $50 - with the added amusement of sitting listening to a rather aggressive headhunter positively bully her clearly exceptionally well qualified client over dinner at the adjacent table - worth every penny - so perhaps not the best place for a discreet dinner.

Upon arrival, I obtained 2 keys from the front desk as I didn't want to wake up my mother in-law. There was no one to help us with our luggage. We arrived to find some stale nuts and dried fruit on nice plates in the room. The room was a deluxe something room... it looked less better than a Hampton inn or Sheraton room. The towels had no good smell to them... they were as hard as billow pads. THE ROOM WAS HOT!!!!!!! We were cooking like chicken even after lowering the thermostat to 68 degrees. At breakfast we were seated and served ok.... just that all the non-African Americans (whites) did not want to sit near us. Wow!!! They didn't even wait 2 seconds and mind you we are educated non-ghetto acting people and look normal. We left our fried chicken and cocoa butter at home. We had several functions to attend that day and the next. My kids went swimming and as soon as they got to the pool..... the stares started. Then people (white) started to get out of the pool. Ugh!!!! I wanted to cry. I wanted to pull my kids out of the pool but I stayed strong. The Asian man stayed and enjoyed his swim and even said bye on his way out. I felt okay after that. By 4:00 pm we went to grab a bite. This lady with short blonde hair was so rude. She said that the restaurant wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t open until 5:00 pm... it wasn't what she said, it was how she said it... she didn't talk to the white people like that... We ate, paid and left. The next day.... Forgot to mention, the concierges were always nice to us. ... The next day we came down... left for the wedding around noon... the stares...... came back.... the concierges were still nice... the valets were nice.... came down at 6:30... Called for our car.. I think this valet was confused... kept asking if we were staying at the hotel... kept asking if we were really coming back and if we were going to sleep at the hotel at night, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctipped him a $20 so he'd be quiet and get off our backs. Come back at 9 something. My mother in-law wasn't happy about something that had happened... The blonde had disrespected her. She went to get dinner around 7 pm and had her sister and 2 friends. She was going to eat and the others just wanted drinks. The blonde said she could eat at the bar. This is 60 something year old lady. My mother in-law repeated that she would like to have her meal at a table. The blonde said those tables were for people that were going to eat. My mother in-law said she was going to eat and the others would have drinks. The blonde repeated... You need to go to the bar because this place was about to get real busy and other people would need the tables!!!!!!!! My mother in-law then said she was not going to do that and called for the manager. Of course the manager was apologetic and offered complementary meals which my mother in-law refused. She had been disrespected and a complementary meal would not sweep away how she had been treated. Yes, I am pulling the black card..... I saw how she treated us compared to the others.. More to come. That night, I went to order food to take to my room. We were not going to eat downstairs but once we stepped down... Oh Oh!!! The stares were fierce..... I almost went to this lady to ask why was she starring so hard... we waited to be seated but the host kept passing us by... we went and sat down but no one came... I got up and stopped the host and said we just wanted to place an order and come back for it. He said we should go to the bar. So we went there. The kids sat and so did I. We waited on the bartender who looked at us and kept doing his stuff. Later he came.. We ordered.. he was reluctant.... he didn't even finish and the manager showed his face and said, \"California law prohibits kids at the bar. Well!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We wanted to resume... he was busy...I then went to the manager and said we would leave when he had finished our order... The waiter gives us open glasses..... !!! I look at him and ask about the bottled drinks ... reiterating that we were taking these with us... ????? He said if we preferred bottled he'd get us those....... I am just through....

I was completely shocked and distraught when I found the bugs and felt like they didn't do much to accommodate me. When I reported the bugs and requested a room change, they gave me an apology and literally swept it under the rug. I really wanted to be respectful and not make a big deal out of it but now that I reflect on my actions, I should have thrown a fit so that they would have given me more respect. To be honest, all I really wanted was a nice human gesture by the hotel to make me feel better. I mean I was so terrified, I couldn't sleep at all and sat up the entire night in my new room. I wish they would have told me that they were doing everything in their power to address the issue because it's so prevalent today. Instead, they moved me into a new room (downgraded me by the way, I mean they could have ran out of rooms but also didn't tell me), didn't help me check if there were bed bugs in the new room or even ask if I was okay or comfortable, and sent a security guard to question me on the \"incident,\" as if it was some kind of accident report. The one thing the concierge did ask me was, and I quote, \"Do you want your laundry done as well because when this usually happens, we offer this service but since you're leaving tomorrow, I don't think we can get it to you in time.\" I do understand that it was my last night, but I had asked them to return my laundry by 4pm which was not particularly early but they were unwillingly to budge on the time that they could deliver the clothes (6pm). I mean really, 2 hrs? I bet they could have pulled some strings to help me feel better about not taking home any critters with me!!! On top of that, when she said \"usually,\" it made me really wonder if they've implemented any kind of protocol to remove these critters from the rooms. I really expected more from a 4 star hotel.

Big bathroom, nice bed (very comfortabe - I wonder if my room was updated based on others' comments about the beds!!!??). Had dinner in the hotel bar/restaraunt. My first \"hostess\" or server was either new or tired or generally disinterested. Howver, i asked for the sommelier and once I did I was immediately apporached by a professional young man that was very knowledgeable. My server then changed to a waiter that was very good as we discussed food/wine pairings. I sat in the bar area and it was a little loud but not crazy, just people gathering and having cocktails (it was later in the evening). The Pinot choice, sweetbreads and cahr were all outstanding. They need to re-train the young lady however. I did NOT use the Concierge that so many other reviewers complained about so it must be said that my stay may have been negatively affected had I encountered the issues that others did.

Tidy and spacious bathroom too with good space in cupboards for hanging suits etc. I appreciated the big workspace to sort out the afterhours stuff that often crops up on a business trip. I used the gym and jacuzzi/swim pool once - all very clean and user friendly. Really great after a busy day and on the 6th floor so not too far away as they can sometimes be. Fresh fruit and water available as well - nice touch. I had dinner in the restaurant on one of the evenings. Wine expensive as was the small dinner portion but that said it was expertly served and of excellent callibre. Richard was an excellent waitron and is to be commended on his great service and advice. On my final day I had to avail of the concierge on two occasions - one with William to arrange a place to eat - excellent suggestions offered - and to get a cab to the airport on time: Both were well arranged. The other issue dealt with an undelivered package that Bill Sutton said he would sort out for me immediately even though I wasa leaving that evening. And he kept his word - very very nice. All in all I was impressed with the staff and their attitude to me at all times. They were attentive and very helpful on all occasions.

Easy walk to Moscone Center, food, trolley, shopping, union square. Short cab ride to Fisherman's Wharf. I give low marks for value only because the rates are very high - although to be fair - no higher than any other hotel in town during a busy conference. The HVAC was a little louder than expected, but tolerable. The only other thing I would probably change is the spa. Spa was just ok. The thing that stood out is the waiting area wasn't as relaxing as I have experienced at other places. The constant opening/closing of the door made it hard to relax. Suggest they change the doors to something less noisy. Also, there was a bit of upselling of the spa products. After 5 days of walking/talking during the conference, I very much needed to relax! Buying products was the last thing I had on my mind. They offer car service which is comparable to cab fare to the airport (about $40) I believe thiis hotel is fairly new (about 3years old).

It is a lovely hotel - very new and sleek. We had a view facing the city, not the water, but were on the 23rd floor so it was gorgeous. I can only imagine what the water views are like. The conceierge was very helpful in giving me very good public transport directions with about 4 different stops (and I highly recommend using public transport in SF - it's very easy and efficient). The parking was ridiculously expensive, but having said that, every time we called for the car (and we were in and out a lot), it was always waiting and the guys were super nice. If you do have a car, it's very close to the freeway which is handy. The rooms were well appointed and big - there were three of us and we had 3 large suitcases and 10 days worth of clothing and managed to fit it all in without making a huge mess. The bathroom was roomy and pretty with good towels (always a sign of a better hotel). The beds and pillows were very comfy too. Two complaints that other customers had noted were the excessive wireless internet charge - 15 bucks a night??!! We had just come from a Staybridge Suites (same company) in Sunnyvale where it was free. And the computerized mini bar is ridiculous. My daughter was checking everything out in there and of course lifting the things up so I had to call and make sure we weren't charged 100 bucks because she had looked at the gummy bears! The irish pub across the street is a good place for a cheap drink and pub meal. If you want to splurge, the hotel bar was very nice. We did eat at the restaurant and while the service was great, the food, in my opinion, was much a do about nothing. The hotel is centrally located, albeit about a block off the beaten path.

We wanted to visit wine country north of San Francisco and since I am a Gold Ambassador member with Intercontinental hotels, I figured this location would be a good one to use as our home base. I actually got a very good rate of $209.00 per night and using the one free night I had, I thought my total would be $209.00 + tax for the 2 nights. Well that would be the case if only I did not have a rental car to park. Worst yet, I had rented an SUV. Self parking is not available or at least it was not offered to me, so I went with valet parking. To make the long story short, check out time came on Sunday morning and I was looking at the bill handed to me and to my surprise the total was $371.00. I said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd what happened? Well, I was told that the parking for my rented SUV was $57.00 per night, plus tax. So parking was $114.00 for the 2 nights + $209.00 for the room + tax. I know there are a lot of hotels all around the US in big cities who charge similar parking rates per day, but I thought you all would like to know about this one if you are thinking about staying at this hotel in the San Francisco area. The hotel is in a good location, close to Hwy101 and I-80, either one is good to take wine country. The rooms are nice, clean and bright. I would love to have a separate shower in addition to the tub, but that we did not have. All in all, the hotel and the service was good, but if you have to park your car with these guys, get ready to pay the money. I think $57.00 per day for parking is a ridicules price. Just to give you all an idea how bad $57.00 is, I stay at the Intercontinental Buckhead in Atlanta, Georgia a few times each year and the valet parking is $30.00 and self parking is $20.00 per day, not to mention the fact that this Atlanta location is absolutely incredible.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cInternational travellers may not want to hear live music at 11pm\u201d", "Author": "manb0t", "ReviewID": "UR95702454", "Content": "This hotel styles itself as \"InterContinental\", perhaps recognising that many of their visitors are arriving after long flights.

I asked the receptionist if I could be put in a room that was as quiet as possible. She obliged, putting me on the 28th floor but added that \"some guests still find it a bit noisy even up there\". I didn't think much of this since I figured not much noise could make it up 28 floors. Unfortunately, I figured wrong. Even 28 floors up, it was like being back in a college dormitory with a party going on next door. To make things worse, the band was playing terrible covers.

Much is made of Tenderloin and upon checking in we were told that it's best to avoid venturing west of 5th Street. Even though nothing happened the walk back at night past Mission was not particularly pleasant. Better to walk down 4th than 5th from our experience. - I know that American hotels have soft beds but these were a joke. As a result my wife and I did not sleep well and had back ache (we are in our early 30's!) - Fit and finish of the room was a little low quality. The rooms in my opinion will age very quickly.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, typical Intercontinental and would happily stay again.\u201d", "Author": "TravelTiger2010", "ReviewID": "UR92745406", "Content": "This is your typical Intercontinental Hotel - modern, polished and a bit pricey.

Go one street further down and it is 2 hours parking and only starts at 9am. Just watch out which night the street cleaners come.

I'm a Platinum Ambassador with ICHG and was promptly upgraded to a beautiful one bedroom suite on the 30th floor. Floor to ceiling 10 ft. high windows looking out over the city were breathtaking, and well worth booking a higher level room (with the hope, and subsequent success in getting the suite upgrade). We also paid the extra charge for access to the 'Executive Club'. The hotel is located directly next door to the Mascone Center, and is a bit on the 'edge' of the cultural/shopping area of SF. I always felt safe, I just wouldn't suggest walking very far to the east of the property alone. However, President Obama has stayed here twice as president, so the area must be okay if he stays here! This is a fairly new property and it looks it. Beautiful lobby, modern furniture, and all of the polish and class one expects from Intercontinental. The view from the room was beautiful, and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom was nice as well, but nothing to get too excited about. Also, for some bizarre reason, there wasn't a lot of storage space for clothes. Maybe I was expecting too much with a 'suite', but no more closet or drawer space than a normal size room (and this room was 700 square feet). The products supplied in the bathroom were also nice, but I cannot remember the brand. The 'Executive Club' lounge was okay, but became very crowded over the weekend. I've been to many 'EC's' at IC around the world, but never seen one this small and crowded. The food was great, and staff very helpful, but nothing special. The same breakfast food every morning, and the staff did not accommodate for 'special requests'. The gym was very nice, and there was a 'lap' pool that was extremely clean. There was a jacuzzi, but the sauna and steam room was only for 'guests of the spa'. Overall this is nice hotel and had all of the 'bells and whistles' one has come to expect from a 5 star business hotel. The one thing that stuck in my mind about this property compared to other IC hotels is that there seemed to be a lot of children. There were so many and they were so loud in the 'Executive Lounge' that we began to avoid it.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NA", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel\u201d", "Author": "2011NA", "ReviewID": "UR92019931", "Content": "We arrived early in the morning without making prior arrangements for a early check-in.

The pool is next to the gym and only big enough for doing laps. Mr. Bill S. the chief concierge is a consummate professional in providing the level of service and guidance for the guests.

The hotel's also excellently placed for local bars/microbreweries, restaurants and shopping - just around the corner from the Westfield centre. We were in a club room on the 33rd floor; the room was spacious and had fantastic views over the bay. The bathroom had an excellent shower and Aromatherapy Associates toiletries - luxurious, but the lavender and ylang-ylang shower gel was a tad over powering for day-time use! The room gave us access to the club lounge with free wifi, a couple of PCs and a printer and a steady supply of food and drink on tap; we subsequently discovered from some of my husband's colleagues our room actually worked out a lot cheaper than booking at the regular rate and then paying for internet access and getting breakfast in the restaurant downstairs. I was advised on booking that continental breakfast would be available in the club lounge and was expecting a few manky looking croissants and some coffee (obviously too used to British/European continental breakfast) but the food was amazing: a selection of cold meats and fish (including Gravadlax), fruit, loads of different breads and pastries, preserves, bacon and scrambled eggs. We missed afternoon tea every day but took advantage of the cocktails, wine, champagne,beer and (delicious) hors d'oeuvre that were available from about 5 o'clock. There was also cake, cookies and digestifs laid out after dinner. I only had 2 criticisms of our stay; firstly, the staff could have been slightly more attentive - we basically had to work everything out for ourselves; and secondly the tomato based tasting menu at Luce, whilst delicious, was miserly to the point we had to go to the club room and fill up on cookies and was probably the only disappointing meal we ate whilst in San Francisco.

I booked a standard room on the Club floor and was given an upgrade to a one bedroom suite. (Platinum Ambassador benefit) We arrived in the evening and check-in was pretty quick and efficient. It did not seem very busy at all. We were hoping to use the club lounge for a quick snack, but when we arrived they were closing up and the staff looked annoyed when we walked in. A simple \"sorry, you just missed it\" would have sufficed instead of a dirty look. Room - The one bedroom suite we were upgraded to was a handicap accessible room located on the 31st floor. The suite consists of a living room with a half bathroom, a separate bedroom, and a huge bathroom with a separate shower and tub. Each room had a huge LCD television and nice furniture. The bed was very comfortable. There were floor to ceiling windows which afforded a view of eastern San Francisco and part of the bay. The view on the other side of the hotel would have been much better (facing north towards the Golden Gate Bridge). One annoying feature of this suite was that it had a connecting door to the 2 story penthouse suite, so during the 2nd night, we were subjected to a loud party going on with people shouting and music playing. It was too much and we ended up moving to a regular room on the 32nd floor just to get some sleep. The walls were somewhat thin, as we could hear the other neighbor on the 1st night watching TV. You would think for a nice hotel like this, they would have invested in better soundproofing. Food - We ate breakfast at the Club Lounge, which was oddly located on the 6th floor. Good selection of various foods, including some hot choices (eggs and bacon) along with the usual bakery items and fruits. There was some smoked salmon which was nice. We also tried room service, which was a bit awkward. This was the first hotel in my life where I called for room service and was immediately placed on hold for several minutes before someone answered. Finally, we were able to place an order, which arrived in about 30 minutes. Fortunately, the sandwich we ordered was very delicious. Location - Finding the hotel was pretty easy, as we used the BART system from SFO. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from the Powell Street station. The hotel is located in the middle of random office buildings a bit off the beaten path, but still not too far from the tourist areas. You can easily walk to some popular areas such as Union Square and the cable car stop. Since it was a short getaway, we did not try out the other facilities at the hotel. Service in general was questionable. Every time we entered or left the hotel, none of the staff would greet us. The doorman would ignore us and we would have to open the door ourselves (no big deal, but a bit odd for a hotel of this caliber). As a Platinum Ambassador member, I have traveled to many InterContinental properties around the world. I would have to say this property ranks at the bottom of the list in terms of service.

In a hotel that is relatively brand new and serves mostly business and convention attendees? Absolutely unacceptable that I was not able to work in my room at the end of the day. Room was not all that clean -- there were stains by the toilet and not all dirty towels were replaced the next day. Went to iron my shirt only to realize it had rusty water in it that stained my shirt. In a budget hotel, this would not bother me, but for a worldclass hotel this is unacceptable. To cap it all off, I ordered room service my last night. First call was put on hold for 5 minutes. I hung up. Next call, I got my order in and was told it would take 45-50 minutes. 1 hour and 10 minutes later I got a call from in-room dining asking if I had gotten my order yet.

Location was amazing!!! Just a few quick minutes walk to shopping heaven and the cable cars! Upon check in you felt like a valued guest. We were staying in a Club suite which allowed us access to the Club Intercon. If you want a great experience, make sure you book the 'Club level' option it takes your stay to another level. The Club Intercon is located on Level 6 and the accompanying suites are high up, however due to a fear of heights they relocated us to level 10, which still had lovely views over SF. Club Intercon gives you: > Breakfast - don't expect a full buffet, but you will find scrambled eggs and bacon/toast ; fruit and cheeses; cereal and juices; pastries; tea and coffee. More than enough. >Complimentary drinks bar 5:30pm to say 7:30pm - Fabulous, before dinner you can enjoy a drink and some great canapes, watch some TV, read a magazine or chat with the staff, special mention to Luis who is just fabulous and very friendly. >Supper nightcap - Call in after dinner for a Baileys on the rocks - great touch. >Best part - Business centre - free internet access, to check your emails, print off documents and plan other parts of your holiday/business trip. The staff of the Intercon SF are helpful, friendly and very professional. Concierge recommended some great restaurants which were fantastic. The rooms were incredibly clean and housekeeping were courteous and happy. The ONLY downside was the valet parking cost US $60 was outrageous. If you are not a guest of the hotel , fine, but 3 days of valet parking hurt. US $25-30 is appropriate. You can park at a big carpark around the corner, but it didn't look safe and as we had a rental car we felt it was safer with the hotel. So in summary: Plus+ *Very luxurious, modern and clean *Great staff, efficient, courteous and professional *Great location, close to Shops and walking distance to Union Square *Rooms great size and comfy beds and pillows, the topper was like sleeping on a cloud. *Club Intercontinental - Amazing can't rave enough, takes your stay to another level. Minuses - *Valet parking - very expensive *Noise - be warned SF is a big city and this hotel is located in the heart of it, you will hear sirens often, 1 night in particular must have been busy as the sirens woke us on a number of occasions, nothing to do with the hotel though, but it did impact on our sleep a little. Perhaps the higher you are the less noise you hear. In Summary a really great hotel, it was a pleasure to return to this hotel everyday after a long day of sightseeing and shopping.

Travelling from the airport we found the hotel pretty easy to navigate to using public transport as we used the BART to get to Powell and then a 5 minute walk to hotel. Once checked in we we given a floor on the 30th floor which had great views towards at&t park and bay. We had been left a lovely touch in the room of a complimentary bottle of prosecco complete with a card as we were on honeymoon which was very much appreciated and went down extremely well after our 16hr travels. This level of service and thoughfullness should not have been a surprise as it had already been displayed when i was trying to source a hire car before i travelled and got excellent advice and service from Bill Sutton through e-mails and on our 2nd day we were helped so kindly again by William Hall as i had forgot to print my Alcatraz tickets and realised we would need loads if ID to pick up tickets at pier so William allowed us to e-mail him conformation which he could then print. Staff on arrival and departure each evening were also very welcoming. The room was lovely, fresh and spacious and really liked the wall to ceiling windows and the i-pod docking station. One of the main reasons i chose the hotel was due to its newness as i dont like old and tired hotels. We used the pool every morning and was pleasantly surprised how quiet it was, on the first 2 mornings we had the place to ourselves which was a bonus and the gym looked good too although never used There were a few negative things about our stay though which were the intimidating walk to the hotel in the evenings, the overall average room rate, the lack of a bath tub, the expensive wi-fi and not being able to have any fridge space in mini bar. I had read reviews before going saying that the area is a bit shady at night, we made the mistake of stopping off one evening when returning at a liquor store on 5th street for a bottle of wine and i felt quite intimidated by people inside and outside so we did a bit of powerwalking back to hotel, maybe a tourist mistake but you dont want to be looking over your shoulder on holiday. Since we were moving around the States on our honeymoon (8 different hotels/motels) the room rate was the 2nd highest we paid and didnt even include a breakfast and only 4th/5th nicest out of 8, maybe a san francisco thing, we found santa monica the same in terms of value for money. The lack of bath didnt bother me but my new wife was looking fwd to a good soak after our travels and so was disappointed. The wi-fi charge is expensive and again whilst comparing to other hotels (2 motels didnt have) we stayed at this was the only hotel that didnt offer free wi-fi (albeit others lose charge in resort fee) which was disapointing as for 2 travellers with i-phones the wi-fi is a great way to research places to go and restaraunts during your stay. The mini bar was all tagged electronically so couldnt remove items and replace with bottled water / wine etc which was also disappointing although there were ice buckets.

The stations are 2 blocks away from the hotel. 2. i don't really get the internet charges either $15 per day. Most hotels now offer this as a free service. Staying at intercontinental means you are willing to drain 200-300 bucks per night, so 15 bucks is nothing. NO... as someone who travels often, I think internet should be free. You're really going to lose numerous potential 200-300 a pop clients over to oh I don't know, maybe the four seasons for 15 bucks? 3. service was great. i didn't need much. easy check in, clean room, friendly faces. which during my stay, i got all and then some. my entire stay was for 3 nights, but every time i left the building or came back, the receptionists smiled, the housekeepers asked me how i was doing, and the doorman got the door. what more could you ask for? 4. during my stay, the pool was unavailable due to construction, but i look forward to using the pool when i am back in town in august. i've looked at other ihg hotels (such as mark hopkins, and holiday inn on van ness), and to tell you the truth, i rather stay at intercontinental. maybe the only exceptions would be the W hotel or the 4 seasons. 5. i seriously wonder about the negative experience one may have at this particular hotel. may i ask if it may have been your attitude? Treat others like how you would like to be treated. Kindness is a two way street folks. Yes, it is the hotel staff's job to be accomodating and provide a positive service but they too are human. Come up to them kicking and screaming, you really think that's going to get you far? Really?! 6.

Also, my appetizer was salty that I had to return it and the response was 'chef agrees the pancetta is a little bit too much tonight'. The lobster was ok, nothing spectacular and the dessert was mediocre at best . Every chef can have an off night but what was really troubling was that I wrote a lenghtly comment card reg. my disappointing dining experience and although I was staying at the hotel the whole week, no one from the restaurant bothered even to contact me.

For the first part of our stay we were on the 16th floor which had amazing views and was really very quiet. On the second part of our stay we were on the 7th floor, which was nosier but more due to other guests than the hotel itself. Both times we asked for quiet rooms and got them - we didn't have any other rooms on either side of us (instead we had store rooms). The rooms and bathrooms were also incredibly clean. The Intercontinental is in a really great location, around 5 minutes walk from the Westfield shopping centre and about 10 minutes walk from Union Square and the various cable car stops. One of the best things about The Intercontinental were the excellent staff, specifically Ray, one of the concierges (I feel he deserves specific mention)! He helped us book tickets to Alcatraz and to see Wicked at the Orpheum theatre, helped us book our seats for the flight home, gave us information on how to use the Muni and painstakingly highlighted maps to direct us to places we wanted to see. A complete star. The hotel gym was really very good - light and airy with plenty of equipment to go around, and the swimming pool was also a really good size and rarely busy. In fact I would say the only downside to The Intercontinental was the fact that we had to pay for Wi-Fi, but we only needed to use it on one occasion, and the rooms were such a good price that I don't really feel that this is enough of a negative to lose a star from the rating!

Neat eco friendly items: energy efficient light bulbs in all outlets (but not the dim slow to warm up kind...these you couldn't even tell were any different), a special eco setting on the heat/AC that allows you to engage a sensor and if it knows there's no movement in the room it will cycle down the energy use of the heater/AC unit, and what was really cool, an electronic system to notify housekeeping of whether you want to make up the room or not be disturbed....no more of those silly door cards that drop....you just punch the button in your room and it illuminates a light outside).

There is an in room fridge stocks with the typically overpriced drinks and snacks. There's a free coffee maker (Keurig) that brews one cup at a time in a very mess free system. It is located just two blocks from 5th and Market Street which offers a large number of public transit options, including four different rail lines from that location (BART, Muni, Streetcar and Cablecars). You can easily get here from the Airport on BART and only have to walk about two blocks. (The BART fare is only $8.10....a bargain compared to a taxi). It's also easy at that intersection to jump a cable car to Fisherman's Whart ($5 one way) or hop on the street cars ($2) which can take you down Market and down the Embarcadero to eventually end up at the Wharf. But if you want to drive, there is valet options and two self parking lots just one block away ($35/day). It has a good restaurant with an award winning chef and a nice lobby bar. Now some drawbacks.....there's no free internet. It's $14 a day. And, the busienss center charges for everything except printing boarding passes (which are free). The pool is the narrowist I've ever seen. But it is long and ideal for lap swimmers. There are two lanes and if you swin for fitness, you'll love it. If you have kids who want to have fun....it's not that great. The hot tub is nice, though. Public gathering spaces are not abundant immediately inside the lobby. The hotel does have two larger gathering spaces, but they are upstairs and you have to take the elevator. Not a big deal but you can't just loiter easily in the front of the hotel unless you want to sit over the concierges (who are all very, very friendly.....they were great in helping us figure out places to go). The other issue is that the location is just a bit outside of the really active area of SF. If you want to be right in the middle of the action, this might be a few blocks past your confort level, but if you want to be close by without the ruckus....this spot is ideal. But I was most impressed with the overall cleanliness. The hotel still felt brand spanking new.

When we returned to check in that evening, the person checking us in knew nothing about it. So we had to argue for a bit, and wait until that person could contact the person who had checked us in. My wife was more annoyed than I, as she would not have agreed to check in later without getting a substantial return for it, being tired from the trip. It did get sorted out later, and we received what they had promised. The pool was also closed while we stayed, though they had made arrangements with another hotel for us to use their pool.

The parking is very expensive per night at the hotel (around $60 for 24hrs) that being said there is a public multi story car park next to the hotel where we parked for $32 per day.

The staff was incredibly friendly, for such a large hotel it felt very private and my room was perfectly quiet, and the overall comfort of the room was just wonderful. However, I recognize that the way I feel about the location as a local is very different from how a tourist might feel. For me, and for business travelers, I see a great, newish, comfortable hotel with cool views that is close to BART, convention center, and the financial district. If, though, I were a family traveling for tourist purposes, I might feel disappointed by the location. It's kind of right on the border between modern/sleek SOMA and sketchy SOMA. As a local, I don't feel uncomfortable in the location, but it perhaps looks a bit sketchier than it is? If I had kids, I would probably feel unnecessarily unsettled. I am probably being way too detailed and nuts in this review, but it's only because I really loved this hotel and would recommend it in an instant to business travelers, but would hate for any leisure travelers to feel disappointed by an overly glowing review!

Thaat being said, since I like to stay in my own place and not with family, I've stayed at all the 4/5 star hotels in SF over the years. I am now currently at the 'Intercontinental SF' on a short visit and as always, I find it to be an exemplary hotel. Up until 2007, I had been a fan of the Mark Hopkins for several years but it is getting a little worn around the edges. This cutting edge Intercontiental within walking distance of downtown and the Bart, is simply the 'Cats Pajamas'. I am always remembered or it is noted in the computer that I am a repeat guest and I instantly am upgraded to a fine room with a stunning view that should cost twice of what I wind up paying. The breakfast is the average 4/5 star price but...it is a wonderful selection and it is worth the price to sit in your room and look out at the view while enjoying top quality ingredients (which are listed..including organic and heart healthy) in your room. It is also fab in the restaurant. The Spa is simply the best in SF. I have had a massage to a half day of treatments and it is a TOP spa. for a spa alone...not a hotel spa. The rooms are all fresh, very clean and tastful as are the bathrooms. I was surprised to see a review that said front desk was rude ..perhaps the reviewer was not in a good mood? I find the staff in general to be the friendliest and most client geared in SF. That is why I take these reviews that don't make sense with a grain of salt. I can validate that this staff is most friendly and looking to please...I know nothing about the reviewer who wrote that they were rude...but in several years that has bnot been the case for me. San Fransisco is a spread out city and you must walk. Wherever I stay, unless I want to just be in one neighborhood, I walk. This is why you come to the city on the bay. To say the Hotel is out of the way is ridiculous as then it would apply to all hotels in SF. Walk...or if you are going to the other end of town...ask the concierge who is terrific for a suggestion.

The rooms were spacious, room service food was delicious and the location of the hotel is very convenient for getting to/from SFO and various points of interest in the city. There were some aspects of our stay that I think will be useful to other travelers considering this hotel: 1. The hotel places a $200 HOLD on funds from your credit card or debit card for EACH DAY of stay. Those funds are not available to you during this period of time. At the end of your stay, your actual expenses are then totaled and any remaining balance from the frozen funds are released back to your card. This is not spelled out on the hotel's website or third-party reservation websites and posed a problem for us, as we were not prepared to lose $200 of spending money each day. This information should be made available to guests prior to their arrival. The hotel desk clerk informed us that this information was not relayed to us by Expedia (whom we used to book our stay), but I checked Intercontinental's website and could not find this information there, either. If it is there, it should be more prominent. They also could have mentioned this when I called to confirm our reservation the day before our arrival. Let me be clear: I don't have a problem with the policy of holding funds, but there is no reason why guests should be surprised at check-in, when they can be informed beforehand, which would allow guests to plan their travel budget/spending accordingly. 2. The front desk service is mediocre. Not very friendly (although not rude) and I was surprised that no one ever even asked us why we were in SF. Given that this is a convention hotel, perhaps they just assumed we were business travelers. Not the case. It would have been nice to be asked. Also, we were not wished an enjoyable stay, nor were we asked if we were satisfied at the end of our stay..minor points, but when it comes to service, the little things count. 3. The bar and restaurant are woefully inadequate to handle all of the conventioneers and other guests (i.e. US). After getting married and having our photos taken in and around the city, we returned for some celebratory champagne..We found seats in the very-crowded lounge area, but the waitress that was taking orders ignored us. We fought our way up to the bar and eventually got some attention. 4. And perhaps the most annoying part of our stay..the comfort of our room. Our room faced east and when the sun rose each morning, the room became hot. Not just warm. HOT. We had the thermostat adjusted to the lowest possible setting and the fan turned on \"high,\" yet we still roasted the morning of our wedding as we showered and dressed. We were told the hotel was booked to capacity, so no other rooms were available. Some things cannot be controlled or fixed, but this was still disappointing. It didn't ruin our day, but a pickier bride and groom-to-be might throw a fit. Finally, the parking is quite expensive. We were told that we would be charged $43 per day for parking at the hotel. It was $53 on check-out. Luckily, we found a garage DIRECTLY behind the hotel (and probably the one they use for guests' cars) that charged $32/day. While this may all sound very negative, we were not UNhappy with the hotel. But we won't choose it again. Overall, I would say it's great for conventioneers, and mediocre for people traveling for leisure/special events. NOTE: We did not tell the hotel we were getting married. We did not expect or want preferential treatment. The criticisms noted above have to do with basic service and are not based on an expectation of special treatment.

At best, I would say that it is inconsistent. The bell desk, valet parking, housekeeping, and restaurant staff were all very pleasant and helpful. The front desk staff, however, were largely unhelpful, slow, and in at least one instance, unprofessional. Check in took longer than usual, as the person checking us in had to consult with her supervisor on multiple occasions to ask what seemed to be fairly routine questions. We were using a \"buy one, get one weekend night free\" certificate (from IC's Ambassador program), and the supervisor actually complained out loud about how customers with these certificates never give the hotel any advance notice about using them. She actually voiced this complaint to our faces. I thought that was highly unprofessional, especially since that is how the \"buy one, get one\" program is supposed to work: customers are not asked to provide advance notice about using the certificates. In the end, even though we had originally booked a room rate that was supposed to include breakfast, the supervisor informed us that we would not be getting breakfast on the second day because we were using the free certificate. Although I can understand the logic behind this policy, the information was conveyed to us in a rather unpleasant and haughty manner by the supervisor, which left a bad taste in my mouth. Check out also took longer than usual. Even though there were only three people in line, it ended up taking nearly 15 minutes for the front desk staff (two different people from the check-in pair) to get to us. Without making eye contact, the front-desk agent mumbled an apology about the wait. Not a big deal, but another illustration of the amateurish level of service -- and probable lack of adequate training -- in some of the front-desk staff. The hotel itself is quite shiny and bright. The rooms, as others have mentioned, were spotless and relatively spacious, with nice views over the city. The bathrooms are large, with a separate shower and tub. The location is very convenient to Union Square and the Moscone Convention Center, although the tradeoff is that you are farther away from the more classically \"San Franciscan\" neighborhoods such as Nob Hill, North Beach, and Russian Hill. (For a first-time visitor to the city, I would recommend one of the Fisherman's Wharf or Nob Hill hotels over this location, but for a repeat visitor, this location is just fine.) The breakfast buffet in the main restaurant is excellent, with a well-prepared array of dishes. The gym is also well-equipped and spacious.

Not going to rave too much about the hotel room, except to say that we had an excellent stay. We enjoyed the complimentary breakfasts every morning, they were great full buffet and filling up on their breakfast meant we could often skip lunch as we would rather be sight seeing than eating out somewhere. The staff at breakfast were very polite and they really great to talk to for advice (ask a local). One night on returning late to the hotel (10pm) we had skipped dinner due to our Alcatraz tour and were starving for food. Unfortunately the restaurant was about to close so we couldn't dine there but they did let us order the full restaurant menu and eat it in the bar area. This suited us perfectly as we weren't really suitably dressed for the restaurant and really wanted something to eat as quick as possible so we could return to our room. The food we were served was fantastic and was washed down with a couple of local beers from the bar. We were looking to stay at the Westin St Francis but was very happy with the deal we got here, the WSF had no specials on at the time of our stay and was over twice the price we paid here. Good spot for shopping, which was one of primary reasons to visit SF. a couple of blocks away from Union Square.

Last year we discovered this place on a whim when we decided to drive up to San Francisco from Los Angeles for Thanksgiving. We took advantage of the California Staycation package they were offering and got the room, breakfast for two, free valet parking and a $25 gas certificate for under $200 a night. Not only that but on seeing that we were Intercontinental Ambassador Gold members they upgraded us to an executive room. WOW!!! What a room. Floor to ceiling windows and views of the Bay and/or the city. The people at the front desk and all around the hotel were some of the best people I've ever encountered. Friendly, complimentary, accommodating, patient and helpful. Man, I'm starting to sound like I work for the hotel or something. Haha. On check in they valeted our car which thankfully we didn't have to pay for because $60 a day is a bit *um* out of control. They then let us basically choose our room since we were entitled to an upgrade as a Gold Ambassador, the place was a bit empty due to Thanksgiving, and we picked the Executive. It was one of the best if not the best hotel rooms we have ever stayed in. Topped by possibly only the $1200 a night bungaloes we stayed in at the Intercontinental Thalasso Bora Bora. But for the money, this was insane nice. The grappa bar is intriguing and while I'm part Italian that may be the first and only time I ever try grappa. Hello, turpentine. Long story short we decided to return for a special occasion in March when we had tickets to the SF Ballet at the gorgeous War Memorial Opera House. Fantastic show and highly recommended. Yes, the ballet. No, I'm not Billy Elliot. We returned to the ISF and it was just as good as the time before. We weren't able to upgrade to an Executive :( but we did get a room pretty high up with amazing view of the Bay. Seriously, could they have built this hotel ANY BETTER???? No. It's almost perfect. We had a great weekend stay and once again the service was impeccable. So after such great success last Thanksgiving the parents are flying in from North Carolina and we're going to have a family Thanksgiving in San Francisco for 2009. I'm hoping that all of us have as great an experience as we did the first two times as I've really talked up this hotel to the fam. I will be back with another review if it lives up to the billing I have given it. But in sum, I will say that the rooms with the views and the nicely appointed bathrooms are fantastic. I really like the quaint little lap pool and the googles they give you and the workout room. It's not too big, not too small.

Our suite was clean with a great view of the city and the buffet breakfast was pleasantly better than expected. Unfortunately we don't have the same to say about the online booking. The ICH site was running an online promotion at the time: 1 free night for each 2 nights qualifying stay booked within the promotional period (our booking dates and stay was within the specified period). We immediately booked our 5 night stay as there was no indication our booking did not otherwise qualify. We paid $199 per night + taxes for a King Suite that included a complimentary breakfast. We thought it was a good deal considering we would get 1 free night for each 2 nights stay.

Service was friendly and efficient from check-in to check-out. We awoke early each morning and left the hotel for breakfast. Our room was always made when we returned an hour or two later. My one complaint about the hotel is that the restaurants and gift shop are terribly overpriced. A twenty ounce Coke at the gift shop cost $4.00.

Over 2,000 miles of riding the rails was an amazing experience, but when the train came to it's final stop in. EMY, we had to organize places to stay; awaiting our impending road trip south along the coastline of California. Please note, these hotels were booked months in advanced, therefore the rates were very reasonable for the hotels which were chosen for this vacation, therefore; can not confirm that these great rates would accompany the walk-in rates. To begin this adventure, we needed to stay in San Francisco, as the train arrived across the bay in Emeryville at about 5:00PM leaving very tired passengers looking to get refreshed after 4 days on the train. Once again, I was put in charge of choosing the accomidations and the room which would be used on this vacation. Among tons of speculation and excitement in my household, I did the quoting for the Intercontinental San Francisco among other hotels. This one, of course, came out on top citing a good location (close to the train station, the in- and out-bound highways), the Intercontinental Brand (being one of luxury and excellence), and the various traveller reviews and photos of the property. The rate was secured, the room was booked. We had some difficulty booking online through the Intercontinental website so a quick call to the provided 1-800 number fixed all that. My sleuthing had discovered that they were offering various rooms at various prices (of course), but one had stuck out from all the rest. The hotel was offering us accomidation for us in a \"2 Queen Bedroom Suite\". The room was only supposed to be filled by 2 adult patrons, but with that call to the 1-800 number, they pulled some strings and placed us in the room with 2 adults and 1 child. The room promised wall to ceiling windows, two queen beds (with plush beds, pillows and whatnot), large business desk, oversized bathroom, and much more. Everything that anyone would want in a room, for both personal and business travelers. Now, enough about talking about what the room was supposed to look like, let's get into the experience. What it was really like, well folks... it was absolutely fantastic! Would I go so far as to say that it was my favorite hotel, no. That title still holds true to the Hotel Indigo in Amhurst, New York (for reasons which I will go more in-depth later). The hotel itself. A sparkling glimmer of blue upon the horizon of the smog infested city. The location on Howard Street is the perfect place, just off of the major highway connecting the city to Oakland and the Airport, a very convenient spot. The hotel itself, as you have probably noted from the pictures is bright blue with the tinted floor to ceiling windows. The hotel is 33 stories tall, and impossible to miss from anywhere. Upon arrival, we were greeted with very friendly valet staff and the hotel's porter. They offered to take our luggage and park the rental car in the compound downstairs. Now, this is where I will begin to sway from the positive. Before booking the hotel, the agent warned us that there would be a parking charge, and it would be steep as it was in downtown San Francisco. The porter informed us that the total charge for one night's parking under the hotel would be $49.00 before taxes and fees. Yes, is correct: $49.00 PER NIGHT, PER VEHICLE. It's not like you have any choice as per where to park, but watch out. You may be better to take the limousine service to/from wherever you are going, but please be warned. Also notable, California charges you a PARKING tax. So it worked out that parking was about $58.00. Wow, not a good start. The parking issue was quickly accepted, as we trudged into the lobby at around 6:00 PM that night. As we walked upto the check-in counter, we were waiting for service for about 2 minutes while the desk was busy with another customer. Shortly after that 2 minute time, another member of the desk staff arrived to process our arrival. He welcomed us to the hotel, and provided us with the upsell of the Intercontinental Ambassador club. Now, I wasn't paying, and the $150 may be a bit steep, but once I hit the age of majority, I will probably join up the Ambassador plan. If it helps out with my Prioroty Club account, it'll be done for sure. We were given our keys (the jet black 'Intercontinental' card) and we were sent to the 7th floor. I was a little disappointed with the floor, I would have liked to be higher up, to see more out the windows, but the porter (who followed us up with our bags to our room) described that they place the higher floor rooms for those who are staying for longer periods of time. Though on again I wasn't impressed, it was alright, there was nothing really to look at that late at night. We were lead to our room, bags in tow. The key opened the door, and it was like an aura of blinding light subsided to produce our amazing, beautiful, and most of all awesome 2 Queen Suite. The room was deep (see pictures) featuring a long hallway connecting the door to the bathroom and the bedroom. The room was decorated much like the lobby, with modern looking furniture, a 40' or so TV affixed to the wall, the two plush and white beds, the oversized business desk, the sliding door to reveal the bathroom. WOW! It was all so much, this hotel room was absolutely amazing. Upon entering, I was really able to take a look up close at the features of the room. The TV, an LG 40', the beds with a 2 or 3' feather bed add-on and fluffy comforter, the wall to ceiling windows looking out onto Howard St. It was all amazing! To go a little more in depth to the accomidation, I would like to start with the entry hallway and entryway. Entering into the room featured quite an extensive hallway connecting the doorway to the room. The area was a little dull, but what followed the entryway quickly made up for it. Due to the hotel being so new, they are able to add in many different features which would come with newer buildings. What I am leading upto would be the electronic controls featuring \"Do Not Disturb\" and \"Make Up Room\" which both do exactly as they say,but in a way which require no effort on the part of the guest. Great innovation! Also included here was the closet featuring automatic lights (turning on when the door opens and off when the door closes), an in-room safe which they say is large enough to hold a laptop (I don't know about that...), and of course extra pillows and blankets. I, of course, opted to take all the pillows which I could find for myself (6 in total which were available throughout the room (without taking the parent's). Moving into the main room, you are introduced to a vast space of all that is Intercontinental. On the left of our room there was the TV and underneath was a table or dresser featuring the mini-bar and storage dresser (complete with coffee machine using Tassimo technology). On it's reverse side were the two Queen beds. We were very lucky to get the ability to secure this room, they were very large (for a Queen), immensely comfortable (feather bed topping made the bed so soft), and came complete with 5 pillows each. The whole package equaled an unparalled sleeping experience later that evening, I haven't slept that well for a very long time (in a hotel, that is). Beside the beds lied the oversized business desk. The desk featured a very new Nortel phone featuring colour screen describing all of the room features and welcoming us to the room (of course with the name of the guests)! Last but not least, the bathroom. Oh the bathroom! Featuring your standard fixings (as required by law xD), they brought the bar up a notch. The shower, spacing the entire width of the room, glassed in with an oversized glass door and specialty shower head was truely a delight to use after using a cramped shower/toilet combination on the Amtrak train over the past 4 days! Settings set to: \"Rain\", \"Massage\", and \"Pulse\" were great to get back to that crisp and clean feeling I had come to miss over the past few days. The bathroom also featured a completely separate bathtub on the opposite side of the room. The ammenities were first class, imported from the Czech Republic by some company. As usual, they were the usual fixings, but were oh so good! Everything was great, the night's sleep was great in the most comfortable bed on earth and made the night pass by very quickly. Unfortunately, the hotel stay had to come to an end, so it was time to check-out and head down to the next stop on our journey this evening. The next morning, and early rise was accompanied by the bill collection. The room was the same great rate as was advertised, the only kicker was the parking. $49.00, plus the California State \"Parking Tax\", and some other stupid charge which brought it up to the high 50's. Otherwise, there weren't really any other surprises, leaving us happy campers! My final statement, falling behind the Hotel Indigo in Amhurst, New York; the Intercontinental San Francisco takes 2nd place on my list of favorite accomidations. The hotel is stunning, brand new, and is full of everything you would ever want and need. If you get a chance to stay in SF, you MUST stay here, you won't be disappointed! All this raving about the place and it only gets 2nd place, you ask? Well, San Francisco stacks up as the city I will NEVER visit again. The location is near Union Sq. which is also full of people panhandling, bothering you every few seconds, and then occastionally trying to steal your wallet and belongings (lovely experience, really... chasing off some idiot nearly reaching into my pocket.) SF was just not a good place to be, if you don't have to go, don't. If you have small children, stay even farther away. You wouldn't want to scare them away from the Big City atmosphere. Try somewhere else like Chicago, there you will give them a more warm approach to the big city!

I originally tried to book the InterContinental for a weekend stay but was told that they were sold out on Saturday. I made a reservation for Friday night and got a reservation elsewhere for Saturday. Upon arriving (after dragging our luggage in ourselves with no one there to open the doors) I was told that the room had been booked for Friday and Saturday. Figuring I would stay at the InterContinental both nights, I called the other hotel and cancelled my reservation for Saturday night, incurring cancellation fees. I had booked a King Junior Suite but was now told that they didn't have one available. But they were sure I would like the room they had. Exhausted I took the key. The room was nice, but standard. I booked the King Junior Suite for the floor to ceiling windows which my room did not have. When we got to the room we ordered a rollaway bed, which arrived promptly. However, the phone call at 12:15a.m. to ask us if we had received the bed was not appreciated. We returned to the room Saturday afternoon and were surprised to see that it had not been cleaned. We ordered room service and then the maid knocked on the door and asked us when we were going to check out. When I told her Sunday morning, she asked me to call the front desk. They told me they had no record of us staying Saturday night and by the way, they were sold out completely and we would need to check out. I explained that I had been told at check-in that the reservation was for Friday and Saturday, explained that I had cancelled my other room and had no where to go! (San Francisco marathon that weekend, hotels booked!) The manager agreed to let us stay after several phone calls, but meanwhile room service had put our order on hold! It took more calls to get our order and our refrigerator unlocked. Then as we finally sat down to eat, the phone rang yet again, the front desk was asking me to come down and give them a credit card because apparently they closed out our room tab. In addition to all of the above the pool and jacuzzi were closed during our stay. We were traveling with a child and chose the InterContinental because we knew she would love that pool!

We paid around \u00c2\u00a3800 for 3 nights - so not cheap by any ones standards. The hotel is based around 10 minute walk from union square and the tram terminous. We decided to stay in this area to mainly get good access to shopping and resturants. The shopping can not be faulted - but the resturants within stumbling distance are limited in this area - you need to catch the bus or tram up to other areas of the city to get a better choice. On arrival (taxi around $40 from SFO) we were not greeted by a bell boy and carried our own luggage in to reception (and to the room as we were not offered help). We checked in without hassle - except for the receptionist trying to sell us an upgrade to some chargeable loyalty scheme (not meeted with great joy after 15 hours travelling!). We stayed at the hotel for a birthday and anniversary trip and as such booked a room on one of the executive floors (top two and offering complementary food and drinks included in the rate (which was great)). When we arrived to the room they had decorated it with rose petals which was a lovely touch - when we got back to the room after dinner there was also a lovely dessert and bottle of sparking wine laid out. This to me is a great sign of a hotel who has taken note of that 'special requests' box on the internet booking site and it was really appreciated. Despite this being a lovely gesture - there was a thorn in the roses - the rose petals and desert left overs were left in the room for the next 3 nights - leaving rotting food and petals laying about. We eventually put the desert out in the corridor, but had no desire to spend out vacation on our hands and knees picking up rotten petals! The staff at the hotel also seemed new and didn't really know thier area. The conceirge desk sent us to the wrong car hire location, gave us wrong phone numbers and when we asked the staff in the lounge for resturant recommendations and details of our booking they could not help us and sent us else where. One of the reasons we booked this hotel was the leisure facilities - to our disappointment the pool was closed as it was broken - and properly broken as it was empty and being worked on and must have been for some time as the hotel offered an alternative a couple of blocks away. Again, while i applaud the hotels ability to arrange an alternaive - its not the same as being able to go downstairs in your dressing gown for an early morning swim. They also didn't mention this on check in - waiting until you were in your room to be greeted by a letter. and one final gripe - the water pressure. This was non-existant in our bathroom.

For both stays, I was there for only a few days. Rooms: Since this is a new hotel, the rooms are well-appointed and large. The room had a very large flat-screen television, desk, and large king bed. The rooms have large windows (floor to ceiling), but there really isn't much to look at directly by the hotel. Perhaps a room on a higher floor would be worth seeking out if you want views of the city. Service and Amenities: The hotel staff was friendly and polite. I didn't make much use of the staff, but my interactions with them were pleasant. One glaring annoyance is that there is not free internet in the hotel. I realize other chains often charge as well, but this hotel doesn't even offer free internet in the lobby. There is a Starbuck's around the corner you can use for WiFi. Location: The location is fine, just a few blocks from Market and right next to Yerba Buena Gardens, and several blocks from Union Square. The neighborhood is safe considering it's San Francisco. I did walk alone at night, but not everyone would feel comfortable doing so. If I weren't familiar with the neighborhood, I would hesitate to stray too far from the hotel. Value: Both times I booked through Hotwire, so I did not make a deliberate choice to stay here. Based on prices quoted on the web site, Expedia, etc., this hotel is overpriced. If you really want to stay in Union Square, then you will end up paying for it, but even so, there are less expensive hotels of similar quality in the area. I usually try to avoid this area of town because it is packed with shopping tourists, but for both of these trips, it was really convenient. Also, when booking on Hotwire, I try to stick with neighborhoods I know. P.S. Restaurant: I was very excited to try the restaurant, since the chef was recently recognized as best new chef in Esquire, but I was really disappointed. The service was the highlight. Food and wine were served promptly by informed waitstaff. The decor in the restaurant is pretty cheesy (an attempt at chic 1970s retro, perhaps?) I had the tasting menu for $34, so I didn't expect a big meal. I would expect that a seasonal tasting menu would not include things like New Zealand scallops and out-of-season strawberries (in June), especially in San Francisco.

The Intercontinental seemed to be interesting and we were not disappointed. They offered a great deal which included a buffet breakfast each morning, free parking and daily cable car passes. We specifically paid the extra to get a corner room and it was well worth it. Our room was on the 23rd floor and faced the bay side. The corner rooms offer two walls of floor to ceiling windows. Because the Intercontinental is a few blocks from the heart of downtown San Francisco, the view is not blocked by other large buildings. You do not have a view of the next building, but instead you look out over a city that is even more beautiful at night. We slept with the view fully unveiled each night. The bed was wonderful and plush. A large flat screen TV was a nice touch. The swimming pool was under emergency repair and I was disappointed at first, but honestly we never had time to use it any way. As the breakfast buffet was included with our package deal, we enjoyed it each morning. I would not have paid $28 each otherwise because there are lots of simpler options at local coffee shops.

The bohemian regentrification of warehouses, nightspots, residential hotels, art spaces, loft apartments, furniture showrooms, and the infamous Folsom BDSM zone can be sketchy in some blocks, especially around 6th & Mission.

On neither occasion did the hotel manage to allocate us interconnecting rooms despite a request made at the time of booking. Internet connection of $20 per day was steep. We did not dare touch the minibar fridge lest the sensors ring up a charge. The in-room safe was small - just big enough for a regular laptop plus some documents and valuables. Room insulation noise-wise was not great - slamming doors along the corridor reverberated along the walls, and conversations from the rooms next door and from out in the corridor could be detected without difficulty. We did not take any meals at the hotel so cannot comment, but the bar area was well-patronised. There was a long queue for checking out but this can be by-passed by calling the operator and checking out over the phone.

This pattern of electrical service continued for the next day as well. Apparently still-unresolved construction issues. The phones go down because of a too-small UPS system specified. My other \"modern hotel\" pet peeve is the showers. Part of luxury hotel life is a good, powerful hot shower. Instead this hotel has barely enough water pressure to get wet.

We live here so the homeless don't surprise us, but if you're coming from a non-urban area anywhere in SF is going to have that problem.

This brand-new hotel is convenient, comfortable, and peaceful, with big rooms and smooth, unobtrusive service. Everything just works really well here. Highly recommended. The hotel occupies a soaring blue-glass tower in the trendy South of Market (SOMA) neighborhood; it's two blocks south of Market Street, the main downtown thoroughfare, and maybe a 10-minute walk from Union Square. The decor is sleek and modern, but not too aggressively cool; the lobby is relatively low-key, with a bar and restaurant, giving the comfortable feel of a smaller hotel even though the hotel is quite large. My room, on the 17th floor, was impressively spacious, well-appointed, and tricked out with the latest gadgets, from the motion-sensor light in the entry to the huge high-def flat-screen TV. But unlike a lot of new hotels, the space had been designed very intelligently; the wall unit had ample room for desk space and a long counter, and a window seat and a long ledge in the bathroom gave the sense of additional space to spread out. The bed was very comfortable, with super-soft pillows. The bathroom was also big, with a glassed-in shower. I had decent views from the very big windows toward Union Square and the Civic Center. If you're sensitive to noise, you'll like this: the hotel is impressively quiet. Entering your room is like stepping into a cocoon of silence. There's almost no street noise. I was returning to my room one evening and could hear my neighbor talking very loudly on his phone through his door; but once I entered my room I couldn't hear a thing. Service was smooth and efficient but unobtrusive. There was always someone standing in the lobby to greet you. Wake-up calls were delivered on time, and room service arrived promptly. Housekeeping kept the room very clean. A bonus: the hotel's food is excellent. I didn't eat in the restaurant, Luce, but I had a fantastic Luce burger at the bar (San Francisco has some odd ideas about how to season french fries, but they were still good), and a delicious chicken and eggplant panini from room service. The only possible drawback to the hotel is the location; it's a little off the beaten path, and the block it's on is a little desolate. However, it is right next to the Moscone Center and just a block or two away from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Yerba Buena Gardens, and Metreon, and it's just two blocks south of the Powell Street BART/Muni station. (Hint: If you're coming here from SFO and traveling light, don't take a taxi, which will cost a fortune and take forever; BART will zip you straight from the airport to Powell Street in about 30 minutes for just over $5.) There's also a stiff charge ($15/day) for in-room Internet access, but that's true of almost all luxury hotels; at least the network was reasonably fast.

We normally would have tried to stay somewhere a little more centric, but couldn't resist staying at this brand-new hotel. It is beautiful, simple, elegant and comfortable. Nothing too snazzy, but sparkling clean and beautiful neat lines in the design. I cannot overemphasize how spotlessly clean it is, and how promptly the room gets made up daily. The fitness room is great, although my husband complained that it didn't have a pull-up bar. The restaurant and bar are gorgeous, but the food is, IMHO, quite bad. I don't care if food is overpriced if I am in for a satisfying gastronomic experience, but the food there was absolutely nothing special. There are many fabulous restaurants in the city, so give those a try. Also, when we consulted one of the concierges there for a good sushi place, he directed us to a really crappy downtown joint. He kept emphasizing how \"reasonable\" it was. I guess because we look young (we're in our 20s) he thought we would only want cheap. The place he sent us to was not good, and pretty unreasonable considering the quality! Overall, the staff at the hotel was curteous (although we didn't really need to interact with them for anything - we had no complaints!) and the hotel is a wonderful retreat after a busy day of shopping, going to museums and bustling about that great city!

I have had the pleasure at staying at all three of Mobil-rated five-star hotels in San Francisco and wanted to try something different this time around. I gave the hotel five-stars in consideration of the how much I paid for the room and all the amenities I received. If I paid, say $300 or $400 for the room only, I would have gave the hotel three stars. I wanted to share some of my tips for staying at this particular hotel. For California residents, IC offers a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Staycation\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd package which is inclusive of valet parking ($46 + tax per night), buffet breakfast for two including gratuities and taxes (otherwise, $25 per person) and a $10 credit to your guest folio. I HIGHLY recommend this package to California residents. You have to find the package on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website under the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Experience More\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd tab and book from there. I was given a rate of $159 for a Standard room\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthis rate is the same as their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Best Available Rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is normally reserved for the room only. Since this hotel is buried within the city, there are really no \u00e2\u20ac\u0153views\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to speak of. There are only different vantage points depending on what floor you are staying on. I believe the hotel goes up to the 33rd floor? I recommend booking the room with the most appealing rate and asking for an upgrade at check-in (whether it is gratis or you pay a small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153upgrade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd fee). Keep in mind you need to add 14% accommodations tax (this is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153sales tax\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd) to your room rate. This hotel has a club lounge and here are my thoughts about it. Generally when you book a room with Club Access (for two people), you will be on the 31-33rd floor and it will be about $100 more than a comparable room. If you want Club Access and want to save some money\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6when you check-in (if the option is available) the supplement is $80 (for two people)- you save $20. The caveat is you could be on any one of the 33 floors of the hotel. The club lounge is open from 6:30 AM to 10:30 PM. Unless you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying on a corporate account, this option really does not seem worth it to me. Can two people really eat $80 worth of food? Each additional guest is $40. I would much rather pay $100 for club access if it were the Ritz-Carlton (this option is available at the Ritz San Francisco). Club access affords you food presentations throughout the day, internet access WITHIN the club lounge, and various reading materials and possibly garment pressing (not sure). Other reviewers have mentioned the amenities in the room so I will forgo my usual review and give a synopsis of little quirky things about the hotel. Check-in is at 3 o clock PM and check-out is Noon. Your room is fully equipped with an automated mini-bar (similar to Las Vegas) and it will charge you when you remove something almost instantly (even if you put it back). A Snickers bar costs $6.50. A small coke costs $4.00. When you order room service, you are automatically accessed a $3 delivery surcharge, 18% gratuity, and local sales tax (8.5%). The hotel offers a complimentary shoe shine. Housekeeping did not turn down the room (so no bottled water available although Evian is available for $8). Make sure you make a reservation for breakfast if you receive a breakfast coupon as there was a wait at 9 in the morning. Although that time is generally when people eat breakfast anyways, I normally never have to make reservations because a table is usually available. I tried to check-in at 8 in the morning but no room was available. When I came back at 12, the helpful front desk agent was able to put me in a room then. I did not look at the fitness or pool facilities so I have no comment. When I was checking-out I tried to contact the Bell Desk to have someone help take my luggage downstairs to no success. Each time, the line was busy. My car was brought up in 5 minutes. Overall, if I gauged what I paid for the room and the amenities I received, it was a GREAT DEAL. If I could procure the same rate again, I would definitely jump at the chance. I would not pay more than $250 for the Standard room I stayed in.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Irishgirl_286", "ReviewID": "UR22183815", "Content": "We arrived in San Francisco after a short stay in San Jose with relatives in mid September.

We decided to do the upgrade since we were feeling peckish and were pretty certain we could get our money's worth in free drinks and snacks at the lounge. As it turned out at checkout they did not have a gas card to give us, so they gave us the room upgrade for free instead -- OK by us. The hotel is very modern looking, quite striking really. The check in was pretty quick and efficient and we found our way to our room easily enough. We were on the 32nd floor, and found the floor-to-ceiling windows a great touch. The room however was a bit on the small side, and the bath was one of the smallest we've had at an ICH property that we've ever stayed at. Still, it was very clean and comfortable with great bedding (as usual). The lounge is the smallest we've experienced, too, at any ICH property, although there is a big outdoor area so when it's not cold or raining one could escape the slight clausterphobia of the indoors by sitting out on the patio. Being on a higher floor ended up being slightly annoying, at least when it came to the elevators. Even though there are 4 of them, it seemed that whichever elevator came up to get us would also be the one to stop on each floor going down along the way. We learned to not take the first elevator that would come up, so that we could avoid stopping literally 5-10 times on our way down to the lounge or the lobby. It's a very nice property, despite previous posters if you know SF it's a good location. It was a particularly great deal getting the Staycation package, since $50/night parking is ridiculous (though tip for anyone who doesn't know: there is a parking garage charging far less right around the corner on Mission).

The hotel was only a month old and is only a few blocks away from my work so I'd seen the building during it's entire construction process. On the outside it looks very hip and modern. On the inside, it's just as cool and hip. The hotel is beautiful and many aspects of it are top notch. As a San Francisco resident, I like to stay at hotels in the city for leisure and to spend \"just the two of us\" time with my boyfriend. I must say that this is hands down one of my favorite hotels in San Francisco. It has a completely different angle of luxury than other high end hotel establishments in the city; it's very laid back, welcoming, friendly and not pretentious. I booked 2 rooms for me and my friends to stay and hang out in for the birthday occasion: one deluxe king room and one double room. Both rooms had luxurious amenities. The beds were very comfortable with great sheets and down comforters. The room had a 42\" LCD TV with all HD Channels. The bathroom robes were Frette and the mirrors were anti-fog. It's nice to be able to take a shower and not have to aerate the room to finish getting ready for the night! The staff here is very friendly and really tries to make sure their customers are happy. The location of the hotel is perfect. You're still in a good area of downtown San Francisco yet away from all the craziness of Union Square (but only 2 blocks away from main shopping areas). It's a great option for visitors who want an alternative to Union Square hotels. I always feel that Union Square hotels are expensive for what they offer so if you're looking for a beautiful larger room for the same price, this is the place for you. There are 2 things that you should be aware of when you stay here. Overnight parking at the hotel is a bit steep. It's about $47.00 a night per car. The valet people here are nice and you get \"in and out\" privileges. Also the mini-bars are motion censored for each item. I do not advise that you take any contents out so you can make room to put something in of your own (my friends staying in the double room did this). The second you take the item out it'll get charged to your room, even if you put the item back right away. The process to get the charges reversed and funds back into my account is kind of a pain so hopefully you all won't make this mistake as well.

Door staff very welcoming and friendly, booked into room very efficiently, all staff we met during our stay were very nice. On entering the room first thing you notice is the superb floor to ceiling windows with lovely view across the bay. Great ! No housekeeping issues, the room was spotlessly clean, as was the whole hotel. One evening we were warned to avoid a spilled drink on entering the elevator, by the time we had dumped our shopping in the room and returned to the lobby - it had been cleaned up. The bathrooms have no tub on 28th floor, I believe only the top three floors have tubs - other rooms are just showers. Like many newer hotels the bathroom doors slid closed but did not lock - could be annoying. The flatscreen tv had excellent reception, unlike some other hotels we visited on our trip. The in-room safe was very shallow, unable to store cameras unless very compact size. Hotel location turned out much better for us than we expected. Bloomingdales is just one block away, with the Market Street cable cars also handy. Union Square is a close walk, and as we were walking around the city it felt a better area around the hotel than around Union Square actually. The huge Westfield shopping mall is within the block so the usual food court options are available whilst open. Directly across the road from the hotel is The Chieftain Irish Bar, which had a good choice of local brews, really tasty fish and chips and burgers - and of course, draught Guinness. The staff in here were very friendly also. A few quibbles. The hotel valet parking is $52.44, fair enough for those requiring valet, if expensive. No mention is made that a huge self-park garage is directly behind the hotel @ $30. Hotel website could refer to nearby self-park option. The Visit Luce insert offering a complimentary glass of wine for every entree dish ordered during dinner. Whoopee-do ! Sofitel does this much better offering a complimentary glass of wine or beer at the hotel bar/restaurant - even without ordering food. Often we go on to order more drinks and/or food at a Sofitel after the free drinks - the offer at Luce - we didn't bother. Actually, the Luce bar itself is rather like an airport departure lounge, sited awkwardly opposite the elevators. Not very enticing, but again the staff were great. Final quibble, the bottled water, Evian if I recall, available to guests @ $8 per bottle. We bought some at a nearby deli exactly the same @ $1.20 per bottle. Nobody appreciates being hosed. Our previous night at a Hampton Inn @ $79 rate had two complimentary bottles of water in room. We paid $250 at the Intercontinental. Previously in SF we stayed at Fisherman's Wharf or Union Square, without doubt we preferred staying in SoMa area and will do so in future. To sum up, for us this hotel was an excellent choice, the view of the sunrise across the bay, the cleanliness, location and friendly staff, mean we will definitely stay here next time in SF.

We arrived in SFO around noon - and thought we would try and check in. It was no suprise that our room was not available. We didn't expect our rooms to be available but thought we might try anyway. We checked our bags in with the bellman - who was exceptionally accomodating and offered discounts to the spa and adjacent shopping areas. We were in town for the Nike Women's Marathon and had asked for directions to Union Square. We were suprised by the close proximaty of all of the shops and restaurants in between! Returned around 3:30pm to check back into our hotel when the front desk notified us that the room was not available. No solution or appology was offered for this inconvenience. I had asked if they had an executive lounge and had requested to have access until our room was available. They did make this accomodation and the \"IC\" club was appropriately staffed and had nice amenities. We received our room key approximately 45 minutes later and proceeded to our room. We were mortified that the room was occupied by another guest at the hotel. Luckily for both parties, everyone was fully dressed (I actually read this happening to another tripadvisor reviewer). We returned to the executive lounge and discussed our situation. They appologized and we incurred a half hour delay with the next room assignment. The new room was nice and clean - beds were comfortable. The staff sent a fruit plate with an appology . Once in the room, we called to have our bags delivered to the room. After waiting an hour, we went to the lobby to aquire them ourselves. There was no appology or assistance and were rudely handed our bags. Here is some info on the rest of the property: POOL/HOT TUB/WORK OUT AREA - the pool is a lap pool only - and is nice and clean. The hot tub had an over abundance of chlorine which made our eyes water. We notified the management but was in the same condition the following day. SPA - just ok. We have been in lavish spas...and this is definately the lower end of the scale. Typically there is a great place to hang and relax with the girls prior to and after the treatment - well - don't expect to do this at the spa. There is no separate hot tub area either. We were directed to the pool area when I asked. The shower/make-up area can only accomodate two people and I had difficulties keeping the water warm in the shower. There were three of us who booked 50 minute deep tissue massages - and we all agreed that the treatments were mediocre at best. Definately not worth the price. CONCIERGE - don't waste your time with him. He is useless. Dinner Recommendations: We called for a recommendation for seafood and reservations and we were directed to a dive. Waste of a cab fare and our time. Even the Cabbie was concerned when we arrived at the restaurant. So the Cabbie had much better recommendations for fantastic seafood! Alcatraz Tour: We had called the concierge twice about the alcatraz tour and he noted it was sold out both days. We decided to \"chance\" it the second day (at the advice of a local) and show up at the dock and got in without a hitch. Once again - he was useless. So, for those future travelers out there - if the trip is all \"booked up\" - they do take standbys and can typically accomodate all who show up. We recognized that dealing with the concierge was an exercise in futility and no longer entrusted in him for the remainder of the stay. WHAT THEY DON'T TELL YOU: Stay away from 5th Street at night. It is a know area where drug deals frequently occur. We wondered down Fulsom Street for some GREAT food (definately try Basil) and heard about the drug dealers from the locals. Even our Cabbie wouldn't drive down 5th Street. Fulsom Street is a little sketchy - but there were a few diamonds in the rough that were worth dinning at. Just make sure you take a cab both ways.

First the bad (or the not-as-good if you have a glass-full outlook on life): -Parking is like $48/night. I realize this is San Francisco we're talking about, but $48? Really? Is that necessary? It's more punitive than anything. The valet was pretty slow too. -Location is sort of blah. The SoMa thing is improving but it's still a hike to anywhere other than the Moscone center. We walked it numerous times but the neighborhood is just sort of blah until you get to Market or toward the ferry building. -Breakfast. This was our fault. We were sort of in a rush and we stopped in for breakfast on our way out of town. The buffet was out for $25 including coffee/juice, but we felt that was a little excessive. Instead we opted for off the menu choices. They were okay but were still pretty darn expensive. If I had a do over I would have done the buffet but more likely I would have grabbed a couple of Egg McMuffins instead. There's just no other place to eat within a several block radius unfortunately. Now the good: -The place is sparkly and still seems very new. Everything is very clean. -Being that it was our honeymoon, we splurged a little on one of the exec corner rooms. The view was awesome. We had the sun setting right behing city hall from our room. We didn't face the bay but our view of downtown was gorgeous. The room itself was really big. The bed was incredibly comfortable. I slept the best I have in a very long time. The bathroom was big too and I just love the floor to ceiling windown right next to the toilet. There's nothing quite like sitting next to a floor-to-ceiling window 26 floors up. The flat screen TV is huge and a nice touch as well. -Overall, the good outweighed the bad to be honest even if it doesn't seem that way from above. One should never eat in a hotel restaurant, that was our fault. We were roadtripping, so parking was kind of our fault too. A side note: I went to the business center to catch up on my email. Spent 10 bucks for 20 minutes of service, expensive, but certainly not unheard of. Some woman walked in in a bad mood. She sat down to one of the terminals. She asked about the fee to print. She was annoyed and said she just wanted to print a boarding pass. It turns out this is free if you click that option before paying the 10 bucks.

A big negative was that the room was adjacent to the ice machine room and stairwell (room 902). Though not often, a loud crashing noise came from the ice machine as it filled buckets. The stairwell was used aggressively, why I don't know, at around 3am each night of my stay. It was situated directly behind the headboard and the noise reverberated throughout the room and of course woke each of us up. I suspect it was a staff member checking for breakfast order cards in a manner as efficient as possible for him or her, but I'm not sure.

I was amazed at how well the hotel spaces were designed and the amount of thought that was put into the selection of furniture, wall paper, art, colors, tiles, and granite and fixtures in the bathrooms. I probably would define the spaces as comtemporary with emphasis on clean lines, comfortable textures, warm but neutral tones. The hotel is situated about three blocks south of Union Square and I appreciated it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location. The area is clean, spacious, safe, and without the crowds and noise of Union Square. It only added to that laid back San Franciscan attitude. The walk is short and easily managed with luggage from the Powell BART station. Bart is faster and way cheaper ($5.35) than a cab from the airport. It is a clean, efficient, comfortable travel mode. I think one of the problems with the hotel is that they have so many codes including different rooms and packages that even the staff gets a bit confused. I had booked a 400 square foot room with two queen beds in the corner on a lower floor, like 7 to 11 for $229 including breakfast. Well, this doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exist. These corner rooms (two walls of windows) only have one bed We were given a 400 sq. foot room with two queen beds that oddly was a bit claustrophobic but not in a corner. When I spoke with Janet, the manager, she could not bend over backwards enough to rectify the situation. We were upgraded to the 28th floor with bay view, slightly smaller room (you would never know it) 360 sq. feet with 2 double beds. It was amazing. She took us around to view several rooms AND gave us vouchers for drinks at the bar. The bay view during the day was lovely but even better at night with the lights of the city. Looking at the city view from the hallway, it was pretty spectacular too, especially at night. The room had an ironing board, iron, hairdryer, umbrella, extra pillows, and blanket. The pillows on the bed were a bit flat but one call and we had five pillows on each bed! Nice fat ones too. Toiletries are included as well as a magnifying mirror. The bathroom is large, spacious and did have a tub. The first room we had been given did not have a tub but a beautiful shower area instead. The door to the bathroom was a large frosted glass sliding door, very cool. The room had a thermostat for temperature control, and an ihome radio-alarm clock with ipod dock. There was a larger than life flat screen TV. Little buttons on the lamps (on-off control) are lighted at night and the far bed nearer the window has a button on the wall to light up the entry way. We heard no noise from the hall or other rooms. Occasionally at night we heard a siren from an emergency vehicle. There are two phones in the room, one wireless. The concierge was very helpful and offered many options to all of our inquires. Hotel personnel were really nice. And check out was pleasant, fast, and efficient. There is a very pretty lap pool and jacuzzi located on the 6th floor (available to alll) as well as a club room for those that booked a club room floor. You can also purchase club room access for 80 dollars a day with any other room which includes breakfast, afternoon tea, drinks and dessert. Buffet breakfast is amazing, Try to get it included in your rate otherwise, 27 dollars a person. I did notice that there was a coffee urn set up on the bar just before the restaurant area for coffee with take away cups in the morning. And there is a Starbucks on your way to Union Square. Westfield Mall is on your way to Union Square also. They have a food court, eh, and a nice food market, Bristol Farms, in the lower level which offers hot and cold take away meals. The fourth floor of the mall has several good restaurants including Zazil, a innovative mexican restaurant with fabulous Margaritas.

I can recommend both hotels wholeheartedly. However, my personal favorite (by just a few points) is the InterContinental. For others, the balance might tip the other way. Both are modern hotels, about 33-34 floors in height. The Westin Market Street has the advantage of a location that is slightly closer to Union Square, the symbolic center of San Francisco, and is right in the heart of a busy downtown area, almost adjacent to the new Four Seasons Hotel on Market Street and the St. Regis hotel on Third Street. (The I.C. is about one l.o.n.g block, or 3 short blocks, farther from the center, but is still close.) The Westin also has a very attractive indoor-outdoor restaurant on the quiet back side of the hotel. Rooms at both hotels were similar in size. The room at the Westin was fine--no complaints at all--but the room at the I.C. was somehow just a bit more stylish, and the bathroom was definitely larger and more attractive. We could only get a 9th floor room at the Westin, on the back side, but, to our surprise, the view was great! Wonderful open grassy spaces around the Moscone (Convention) Center, as well as other public parks and squares. (On the front side of the Westin, you probably need to be higher to have a really good view.) At the I.C., virtually all rooms above the 6th floor will have a good view, since the hotel is just a bit south of the high-rise downtown area. Our room, on the 24th floor, had a great view of the San Francisco Bay (and other sights), while my sister's room, on the 25th floor, had an equally great view the other way of the downtown highrises. The sixth floor at the I.C. has a very good lap pool, and a large weight/exercise room with good natural light. The I.C. also has a rather attractive restaurant on the ground (lobby) floor, with high ceilings. It was not very busy the night we were there, although the bar area was jammed and hopping. The concierge gave us advice and directions on restaurants close to the I.C., and we were satisfied with his advice. However, San Francisco has such a great number of good restaurants that one really needs to pin down the kind you want before asking advice, since the list of good restaurants is almost endless. In conclusion, we preferred the I.C. to the Westin Market Street by just a bit, becuase the room was just a bit sharper, the bath a bit bigger, the view a bit better. However, the Westin is a fine hotel, and most people will probably find its location to be just a bit better.

When he showed me the bathroom I gasped \"but where is the bathtub?\". He replied that I needed to book a better room to get a tub. I have never stayed in a hotel room of this quality that did not have a tub and, as a fan of the big soak, was bitterly disappointed.

The lack of a casual eating area away from the bar that was full of noisy convention attendees was disappointing. We elected to eat in the main restaurant. As we had been travelling for a month we were not interested in fancy, gourmet food with clever combinations of conflicting ingredients but in nicely presented, well cooked, fresh food from simple ingredients. The fancy menu was therefore most disappointing.

We commend this staff member for her assistance. The helpfulness of the staff was patchy.

I arrived and due to some miscommunication, not the fault of the hotel, my reservation had not been made.

Additionally, the hotel nickel and dimes you for everything: $30 for a rollaway bed, $15 for internet access, etc. They even tried to charge a fellow traveler for moving (not consuming) items in the minibar! The biggest joke is the \"Instant Service\" button on the phones. It takes them at least 10 rings to answer and then the service is far from \"instant.\" It took nearly 2 hours to get a rollaway bed and when I called twice to have it picked up, it never was.

Everything here is brand new and beautiful - the lobby rivals the W's a few blocks away with a beautiful bar, restaraunt, and reception area, the carpeting in the halls and all the common areas are (gasp!) clean and actually nice! Our room was gorgeous - we had a corner room on the 30th floor - floor to ceiling windows afforded us a terrific view of the city's skyline to the north and the bay to the east. The bathroom was gorgeous, with ceramic tile, a digital scale, and (what seems to be a rarety for hotels) towels that were actually large enough. The room was also equipped with a very large LCD HDTV, and the bed was exceedingly comfortable. The staff was also exceedingly friendly, helpful, and courteous. Other ammentities included an indoor lap pool, jacuzzi, and a full service spa, and the best gym I've ever seen in a hotel. As you'd expect from an Intercontinental, it truly feels like an upscale hotel and a special experience. Can only say two negative things about our whole experience there. a) the parking fee is outlandish - $46 / night. b) The location may not be the best, depending on why you are visiting San Francisco. Basically, the hotel is situated at the southeast corner of what seems to be a nice area - immediately to the north and to the west are the Mascone Center (San Francisco's convention center), two malls, and a block or two further north is San Francisco's Museum of Modern Art. So if you want to visit the museum or you are attending a convention, the location is great. If you are like me, however, and like to explore on foot, most of the other main attractions are a pretty long ways away. Unfortunately, nothing to the south or the east looked too savory, I wouldn't really want to walk in that direction from the hotel.

It has quite simply, the rudest, most ignorant, unhelpful staff of any hotel I have ever stayed in. But let me go into detail..... I checked in at midday and was told my room was not ready. This was fine as, in fairness, i was early. I provided my credit card and passport details and was told by the reception person that I could leave my bag with the porters and pick up my key at any time after 3pm. I actually ended up returning to the hotel at 10pm, at which time there was a huge queue at reception. I asked the porter if he could get the key from reception for me but was told... in no uncertain terms... that he couldn't help. Now, having queued once that day, I wasn't about to do it again... so I stood to one side at the main desk and got one of the reception staffs attention while she was between guests. When I told her i was picking up a key she said \"You'll have to join the line.\" When I explained the situation she turned away, dealt with another customer and then asked me my name, which she eventually looked up in the system. She then told me that I hadn't in fact checked in and so would have \"to join the line.\" Now, I was getting a bit peeved at this point and told here there was no way I was joining the line. So... she ignored me... and ignored me... and ignored me... for at least ten minutes. I then asked to speak to her manager... and was ignored. So a few minutes later when it was clear that she wasn't getting the manager I asked again... so she left her post and went to the other end of the desk where her manager was also dealing with people. Great I thought.... the manager will be along now and we can get this sorted! How wrong I was! The manager also completely ignored me and left me standing there like a lemon! Eventually, and this is after a good half hour of waiting... I actually did join the line. I honestly couldn't believe it... they made a mistake checking me in (i still wonder just what did they do with my details the first time around) and I had to pay for it with my time. Unbelieveable. So, none too happy I asked to see a manager the next day. The only manager available was the head of security who came out \"Maffia style\" (i.e. flanked by a blank faced goon with an ear piece). In fairness to him, he listened to the issue and grudgingly apologised but didn't offer any remedial gesture what so ever. He also never explained why he felt it necessary to have his own personal security guard with him while listening to my complaint. This hotel is new and it shows. The staff are completely clueless as to how guests are normally treated in a hotel of this standard. As for the hotel and facilities... the public spaces are minimalist.... i.e. all the charm of an airport lounge. The rooms are nice but there are no baths which I know quite a few people didnt like.

The furnishing is very modern and bright. The bathroom was spacious and although the water pressure was a little low there was nothing to complain! Room Service: Adapting to SF styles we went for light foods, the best food we found was the bean soup. A little awkward is that the hotel charges the tip automatically, then 3$ for delivery, plus tax... we are not used to this coming from Europe. Pricing in general for f&b is high, but a good Euro to USD rate helped us ignore the pricing a little... Air Conditioning / Bed: The airconditioning worked perfectly. You can change between Fahrenheit and Celsius, and the temperature can be regulated by .5 degrees. The bed was the best I slept in so far-and I travel a lot, and stay at top brands. But this bed beat everything, just like the linen! Perfect! The Club Level: It was very nice of the management to upgrade us to the club, as you enjoy breakfast and snacks during certain hours. Complimentary drinks are available all time. The only criticism we would have is that the service (f&b) at the club is terribly aloof, and often is overwhelmed by their duty. Often plates piled up, cutlery was not exchanged (like at Hyatt), and often you had to ask for things which were then brought quickly though. All in all, if you stick around the city during the day, I would go for it again! In general the IC SF is a more business oriented hotel, but we meet other honeymooners, and casual guests. It did not disturb us, but if you are looking for a hotel with a typical californian atmosphere you would better look for another type of hotel.
