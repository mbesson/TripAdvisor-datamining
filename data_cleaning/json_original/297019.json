Very friendly and extreemely helpful staff. Breakfast is simple, but if you leave too early they'll give you a take-away breakfast. Location is a bit remote, you cannot walk to Spanish Steps or anywhere in the centre, it's simply too far and there are no other sightseeing spots on the way. But the hotel is linked to the city center with 3 bus lines, which are also direct to Termini train station, and a tram line direct to Vatican, so unless you really mind public transportation, the location is not a big problem. Provide about 20 min to get to Termini, 15 min to Barberini, 25-30 min to Spanish Steps. Taxi price from Vatican or Termini is less that 10\u20ac. Ok if you have a car, though the street is off the toursit city center map. Overall, for its price it's very good. Feels no worse than any priced 3-star hotel, and much better than a 20-euro less expensive overcrowded hostel.", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Horsham West Sussex", "Title": "\u201cDont do it\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5431522", "Content": "Just returned from Rome yesterday.

We have just returned and have had a great time at this hotel. I get the feeling some people are expecting a home from home but what is the point of that? I go to another country and I want to experience THEIR cultures and life. The rooms were exactly what I expect an Italian hotel to be with a balcony looking out to a typical Urban scene, pure class! People, it is a 2 star hotel and was just that. As for the comments about the staff, the male members could not do enough for us. They booked stuff for us, rang around and get this, we made a phone call to the UK and they wanted no payment! Oh and we can't understand the problems with luggage storage, nobody charged us! Maybe if you make the effort with locals they will respond positively, I dunno?

The rooms were O.K. for a 2 star hotel. Breakfast was good - sweet rolls, bread, cereal, juice, and yogurt. Nothing fancy, but given the price of breakfast at a restaraunt in Rome it was fine. As mentioned elsewhere, the beds were really firm, but after walking all day, they were quite comfortable. We had 2 nice balconies. The place was clean and had plenty of hot water for showers. The hotel is located north of Villa Borghese and related park so it is a 1+ mile walk to get to the main down town part of town. Once we learned the short cut through the park, it made the walk quite enjoyable and much shorter to the Spanish Steps, etc. The only suggestion I would make for the hotel is that they get some friendlier reception staff. Also, checkout time was 11:00 and we did not need to leave for the airport until 2:00. They charged us Euro 10.50 to hold our luggage in the reception area. It's not a big deal, but it just struck me as a petty attempt to take advantage of us. One thing to watch out for - A nearby restaraunt called the Rossini. They expect you to order appetizers, first course, second course desert etc. and if you don't they treat you like crap. We did order a lot of food (54 Euros worth) and they were really not nice at all. FWIW I would probably stay at the Paisiello Parioli again.", "Date": "January 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sewell, NJ", "Title": "\u201cOozing with Charm\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4146847", "Content": "We had very modest expectations and so we were delighted to find Paisiello Parioli friendly, clean and accomodating.

However this room lacked natural light and seriously needed a good clean. The floor was dirty and dusty. The bathroom was very outdated- pink was the main colour scheme of the bathroom! The whole bathroom had mould growing in every corner possible as well as on the broken shower curtin. The ventilation of the bathroom was very poor and a lot of broken light bulbs which I had to request twice wth the reception staff to be replaced. There were also lots of mosquitoes around the room. There is also no air conditioner which we needed as a small fan in the room didn't do much at all. The breakfast room is situated in the basement of the hotel and seriously needs a refurb. The set up is rather a very strange set up as you basically walk past an open area which has tables and chairs which are not in use and the layout of the room is very poor. The food is pretty average-nothing special. Recommend that you go to breakfast early as the later you go the less food there is as the staff don't bother to replemish. The location is good as there are bus stops right out side the hotel and a tram stop down the road to get into the centre. Tip is to buy plenty of single travel tickets or a travel ticket that is valid for the day because once the tobacco shop is closed there is no where in the area that you can buy travel tickets. There are 3 restuarants down the road, one which we went to twice, but the second night we went there was a major dissappointment as we waited ages to the food. The waiter got our food order wrong and I had to send my food back to the kitchen. The service of the staff at the hotel was very poor. Not that they were rude or anything, but interms of security when requesting for the room key, we weren't asked for any id or name- we were just given our key. This I thought was pretty bad, as we could've been anyone just walking off the street. The highlight of our stay was on checkout when we requested to have our bags stored for a few hours we were charged \u20ac3.50 per suitcase. The justification of it all was due to the fact that we had booked through an agent and not direct wth the hotel. That I thought was the most stupid thing ever for charging guests \u20ac3.50 per bag to have stored for a few hours; as I have worked in hotels before and never have I ever come across hotels charging guests for storage of their cases esp at that high rate- to me it sounded more like a way to make a quick buck. The receptionship said that it would be in a secure area...putting a plastic chair in front of the suitcase was not quite my idea of secure but that is basically what happened and we had no choice but to try and enoy the rest of our day out! The conclusion: I'd much rather pay a little bit more for a hotel that will ensure the room is clean, has a clean bathroom, ensures that the staff on reception are trained to check the name of the person staying in the room and make sure that the hotel doesn't charge for storing your bags on top of paying for your accommodation.", "Date": "September 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wokingham, England", "Title": "\u201cGood value hotel in safe area of city\u201d", "Author": "Nimblefeet", "ReviewID": "UR3469083", "Content": "Our party of four stayed for just 2 nights at end of April.

There are some good, and very reasonable restaurants within easy walking distance, notably Rossinis - friendly and high quality food, cheaper and a lot better than equivalent in London!

Trams and buses all very convenient, and only 12 minutes from Termini on a 910. Don't get a taxi from Termini, they are exorbitantly expensive and take you all round the houses to get justify a high fare!

Once we arrived at the hotel we were given a double room when we went to go and inspect it we found it very dated and dark, it was a duplex room which had a single bed and tv down stairs and the a double bed with a very small bathroom on the floor above, it also had a balcony but we did not feel very safe standing on it. The bed look liked it hadn't been slept in for ages and it smelt damp. We went straight down to reception and then offered us a twin room. We decided that anything could have been better than the last. The twin room was number 212 it was very basis, average size room with two single beds and a bathroom (wetroom) it also had a TV but the only station in english was the music channel. The room overlooked a very busy road which during the night you did not get much sleep because of. The breakfast room was in the basement, when you first walked in you had the impression that you should not be down there, it had plenty of cereal and doughnuts, the coffee machine was not very good. After the first day at breakfast we didnt go back and instead we went to the zoo every morning which was just down the road and very cheap, you did not have to pay addmission to use their cafe and they were very friendly. The hotel was in a quiet area which had some lovely bars and restuarants our favourite was call 'Panda' the service was excellent and the food was out of this world, would recommend it to anyone. The hotel was a bit far out and was a good 20 minuted walk into the centre,it would be ok for a 1 night stay but I would not like to send anyone their for longer. It was right near the Villa Borghese, the park was very pretty with plenty of fountains and buildings we spent a whole day just in the park, you could hire bikes and there was even a lake where you could hire rowing boats for 20 minutes which cost 3 Euros each, that was more like the romantic Rome everone was saying about.
