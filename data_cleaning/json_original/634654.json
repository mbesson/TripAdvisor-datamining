We always feel like going home when we stay there, we always get fed very well during breakfast. Staffs are very attentive, the room gives the feeling of British home, comfortable and clean. Going to Central London is convenient, we take the train from Hornsey Station to connect with Piccadilly or Victoria Lines, very simple and straight forward. The price is very good for what we get in London. We can recommend to our friends, since it is our number choice when we come to London.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cVery Happy with this clean and comfortable hotel!\u201d", "Author": "Ceri B", "ReviewID": "UR119605237", "Content": "Stayed for seven days. Very friendly helpful staff, room was clean and comforable. We had two twins beds which were very comfortable. Ensuite bathroom small but clean and great shower.

Walking distance to restaurants and grocery stores, Crouch End shopping area full of restaurants and coffee bars. Felt comfortable walking from bus as night. 30 minutes to get down town on tube or 45 on bus.

It is located in North London, quite far from the center, but in a relatively quiet location. We felt the neighbourhood safe, because the police station is right next to the hotel. There were also bus stops nearby, it was easy to go to an underground station. Our room was a double bedroom without a shower, but it was not unpleasant. The shower and WC was shared with other rooms on our floor, but it was always clean. The breakfast (toast, boilled egg, butter, jam, tea, coffee, milk, o.j., cornflakes, fruits) included in the price, was also satisfactory. The wireless internet was 2 GBP for 24hours, good quality.

At first it seemed like a basic but clean guest house, and the girls working there seemed nice. Well, i didn't have a clue what was next! Arrived late at night, at about 2 in the morning. The room was very basic but clean so i said, well, is not as bad as it could be, but when i decided to have a nice hot shower after being travelling all day to my surprise there was not hot water! at first i thought maybe there was some kind of problem that could be easily resolved in the morning so i had a 'very' quick shower with freezing cold water and decided to have a chat with them in the morning. When i got up, after 11am, checked the water and was still cold, so i went to the girl in charge to explain the problem. To my surprise she said that they only had water until 11, and after that i had to let them know 15 min before if i wanted to have a shower so they could switch on the boiler!!! Can you believe that!!? Anyway, i thought, ok next time i will call them ant let them know. That night arrived at about 11pm and decided to have a shower as it was a very cold night and been walking around london all day. Tried to call the girls and no one was there, so AGAIN had to have a cold shower. So i decided in the morning i would have another chat and tell them that this wasn't acceptable. And the cold water was not the only problem they call you at 8am!! yes 8 am to ask you if you want your room done. And not only once, noooo, 3 times they called me, hour after hour!! And let me tell you, is the noisiest hotel i've ever been, banging on doors all morning, terrible. So for me, that was enough. i lost my patience and said that i would not take this anymore. They either switch the boiler all day or i was leaving. the girl said she couldn't do that so i decided to leave early and requested a reduction on the 2 nights i stayed without hot water. Spoke to the owner of the hotel and let me tell you, that woman has never heard about Customer Service. She even wanted me to pay for the rest of the days as she claimed it was 72h cancelation notice!! well, well.... she would not believe i was actually 2 days in a row with no hot water, she said that no one ever complained about it and it was her who actually had a go at me!!! UNBELIEVABLE!!! anyway she started to scream like a lunatic, she would not listen to me and would not understand that i had my rights as a customer. At the end decided to pay her the FULL PRICE for the 2 nights I stayed as i there was no way to make her come to her senses. Honestly, If anyone is thinking of going there, please, AVOID IT!!!", "Date": "December 11, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "White Lodge Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d634654-Reviews-White_Lodge_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$85 - $120*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1 Church Lane</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Hornsey</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">N8 7BU</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "634654", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/c6/f9/e1/hotel-front.jpg"}}
