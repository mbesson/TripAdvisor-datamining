You did not have anywhere to stand ,the carpet was filthy,as was the lower half of the walls,wardrobe was a joke just big enough to store toilet rolls that was once you worked out to get in it , furniture was non existant.on a good note lots of tea coffee etc but no kettle to use did ask for one but never appeared ..Bed did not look great but was surprisingly comfortable although was cold during night as only had a sheet and very thin blanket.

No reception desk rather a den cramped with stuff and a bearded wahabi with flat affect face looking at you, gives you the keys and find your way, dirty every where, small curtain (zero privacy) that is used to wipe some body secretions, you can see the white smudge, floor, either floating tiles or dirt stains on the carpet, bathroom tiny and dirty, one in the basement room smelled like sewage and had hair in the shower fron another person, they only clean once every 3 days also clean towels every three days , breakfast, they hand you plate with 2 toasts and pour milk on your cereals that they decide how much you take. If you have any element of allergy be careful as my daughter had ashma attack in this hotel. I sacrificed $300 to run away after ist night as we arrived late and had no choice after were shocked by the picture, You can get much better deal for the same price, don't be fooled that this is the last room and every where is full. there is always place if you look around.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cThere was a slug on the wall in the shared toilet!

We asked whether there was another room, and they showed us a room that was black with mold. No kidding! There were large patches of mold all over the wall. The worst of it all was that there was a slug on the wall in one of the shared toilets. And it wasn't even raining outside, but it was a very warm and sunny day, so the slug must have been there a while! ... It was still there the next day. I checked.

When I mentioned this to the staff I was met with rudeness and no possibility to clean the place, I felt insulted.

I was a bit desperate as all the hotels in the area were booked or extremely expensive and my apartment was not ready and thought I was lucky..It had a nice lobby..Right? Only after I moved my luggage did I find out that the free internet was not, the elevator was not working and my room was 4 flights up. My bag was over 55lbs so I couldn't dream of lugging it up four flights so I left it in their \"secure\" breakfast area. They assured me they had cameras and watched it all day and locked it at night. But the desk personel often were away from the desk and more than once I saw doubtful people in the lobby left while they were delivering towels and so forth. The 60's lock on my door I could've picked myself with a hairpin and the key barely worked. The bed was comfortable enough although the sheets did not fit the bed and came completely off during the night and I awoke to find there was NO hot water to at all.

The trip was all about the sights of London and we did not need a fancy hotel as we understood that a budget hotel would do just to sleep in. We booked this hotel as it is described on various websites as a nice budget hotel in a good central location. Only one of these statements is correct, there is budget and there is the London Continental. What a joke! Granted it is in a perfect location but it is not the only budget hotel to be located in a good location. On first appearance the hotel looks like it is well maintained, nice reception, bright interior, friendly staff etc. In fact all these improvements are to cover up the decaying condition of the rooms which i will not wish upon anyone. The rooms were poorly maintained with our shower looking like it was fitted by a DIY enthusiast. There was mold and limescale in the shower and the corners, the room had a funky smell and my friend developed a rash from sleeping on the bed. I understand that European budget hotels have a different style and way to the American hotels, however I'm pretty sure there are regulations that need to be met in order to run a hotel. This is not another American rant, as I have been backpacking to other destinations in Europe with friends and we have always stayed in budget hotels but none as poorly maintained as the London Continental.

The decoration in the bedroom was terrible and the noise from the floor above kept us awake all night. This was the creaky floor boards and not the occupants.
