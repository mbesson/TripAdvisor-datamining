She took quite a while and so we just stood outside the door waiting...and waiting...and waiting. After being shown our room, we were surprised at how large it was. There was a fantastic view on the fifth floor, but it was generally unclean. The first day we were there, one of the towels they had given us was disgusting...it smelled like SERIOUS body odor. They did not keep soaps and such stocked in the bathroom, and the hand towels weren't very professional. I felt gross touching them. Keep in mind that there is ONE BATHROOM for the entire floor. One of the people next to the bathroom banged on the wall while my partner was in the shower because the water was hitting the wall...you should hope you don't get that room. There is no light in the shower, so you feel like you are entering a dungeon. I wouldn't say the location is great either. The good thing is that there is a cab stand right outside the door...literally. Unfortunately, it's VERY loud outside, so we had to put white noise on to drown out the screaming people (and we were on the 5th floor.) The bed was worn down and the wall was dirty. I would probably go elsewhere next time I'm in Rome.", "Date": "March 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place...and affordable\u201d", "Author": "Laura G", "ReviewID": "UR122494194", "Content": "My friend and I stayed here for a couple of days and loved it. You can't beat the price for the location and the family who owns it was very cute, friendly, and helpful. We stayed in the room with the disconnected bathroom down the hall, which made it cheaper than the other rooms. (Being used to hostel living, this was no problem for us.) The free breakfast isn't much to talk about, but even if it was, we probably still would have gone out for cappucinnos and pastries anyways so it wasn't a problem. We had a great view from our window, the location was amazing, the building was nice, and the room was perfect for what we needed it for. The grandma of the family even drove us to the airport for a very reasonable rate. She was hilarious and it definitely beat having to argue with taxi drivers trying to rip you off.

This is an older hotel, in a residential apartment building, with small bathrooms (yes, there was some mold in ours) but airy bedrooms. The location was SUPERB - between Piazza Novona and Campo Di Fiori, with easy access to many of the main bus lines we needed to get around, and walking distance from fantastic eateries all around. The Pantheon is only 5 min. walk. We could even walk to the Forum and Colosseum. The breakfast was basic 'Italian style\" - coffee or tea, bread, butter, jam. Vittorio will most likely offer you a jug of americano coffee, but I found out (on our last day there!) that he has an espresso machine as well. The streets around the hotel are quite noisy at night and early in the morning, so keep your windows closed if you don't like to be bothered by the noise. TIP - there is an old guy who cooks and sells delicious corn on the cob in the piazza right in front of the hotel. He adds some butter, salt, spicy spices (upon request) and lemon juice. Delicious! You MUST try it!

Rooms are comfortable but not plush-old world charm with its nicely appointed marble decor, cedar built in closets and clean windows. Beds were comfortable but not cushy. Having extra pillows and blankets in the closet was useful. We were surprised that air conditioning was not included in the room price. The tv was mounted high but small screen made it difficult to see. We were not in Rome to watch tv so tv was not an issue. We felt very secure and safe. Breakfast, included in price, was a nice touch if you have a busy agenda. As we were leaving for an early morning tour of Vatican City, the rain began to pour. Management jumped into action, before we could ask for assistance, to call a taxi for us. Beautiful!

Our room smelt awful as the shower curtain had mould growing on it and the smell of damp made the whole room smell. You couldn't clear the smell as you couldn't leave the windows open during the day for security reasons, nor at night as the street outside the hotel is really noisy until about 1am.
