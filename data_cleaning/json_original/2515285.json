The staff were very friendly & helpful on arrival. The apartments are well laid out, kitchenette (cutlery, microwave, fridge, kettle, dishwasher etc), very comfy double bed, good sized bathroom. The room was serviced / cleaned every day we were there. There's a little patio overlooking the street (with table & chairs) but not directly above it so there was no street noise. Lovely little patisseries and boulangeries to sample. Lots of restaurants nearby varying prices. Great spot, I would def recommend it and I would def stay there if I get to go to Paris again. (one thing to note the Reception is not open all day so check your arrival time to ensure there is someone there - we didn't have a problem with this)", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay!!\u201d", "Author": "buznbro15", "ReviewID": "UR119773949", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and enjoyed ourselves immensely.

So the hotel aims to be comfortable, not luxurious, for a mainly budget-conscious traveler. Our room and ensuite was clean, well-furnished, but quite small for a family of three. Fortunately, we also had a small terrace. The kitchenette (microwave, hotplates, dishwasher, fridge) is sparingly but adequately equipped with crockery, cutlery, pots and pans etc, however be warned that a cleaning fee applies if you make a mess. Except for the fridge and making cups of tea, we hardly used it. In Summer, the room is very hot but the portable air-conditioner supplied worked well. Bed-linen and towels are a bit old and thinning. Limited storage space for your luggage. Street noise can be heard although muffled if the sliding glass doors are closed and the blind pulled down. Free internet connection in the room. Despite the shortcomings, the hotel is in a safe neighbourhood, and very well located, with easy walking distance to several underground stations, the Arc de Triomphe, loads of cafes and restaurants providing French and multi-culutral food, and, the bustling shopping district on the Avenue des Ternes, where you will find high-end fashion boutiques and the Monoprix department store. You must visit the narrow lanes between Avenues Niel and de Wagram (adjacent to des Ternes), for the delightful very French farmers market stalls selling fresh produce, bread and pastries, wine, cheese etc. The bilingual hotel staff (English is spoken well) are kind and courteous and happy to help with inquiries about getting around Paris, booking taxis etc.", "Date": "July 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norway", "Title": "\u201cSpacious rooms, clean and central!\u201d", "Author": "Nordkvinnen", "ReviewID": "UR26340781", "Content": "We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in February/Mars 2009. We loved the kitchen and to be able to make our own breakfast in the morning. French hotels seldom offer breakfast included in the room price, so this is a nice alternative. We travelled together with friends and had 2 rooms. The rooms were spacious with comfy beds and nice furniture. The reception staff was nice, though one young girl seemed a bit confused. She had trouble with the computer, was not able to help us when we asked her about Paris and did not speak English very well. She was smiling and polite and I think she tried her best! The other staff we met was great. We liked the hotel, and would gladly recommend it to anyone. We have only one complaint: We started wondering if the place was a trap in case of fire. We were on the 3rd floor, and the hallway with elevator and stairs down was from a very small room in the middle of the building (only a couple of square-meters) with nowhere else to go in case of fire. We decided that we probably had to run out to our balcony and hope someone could find a long ladder if anything should happen!", "Date": "March 17, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cJust like the pictures\u201d", "Author": "travel2008LosAngeles", "ReviewID": "UR17840937", "Content": "I researched for hours to find an apartment or hotel to house my husband, 15-month old, myself, and mom in two rooms. We were staying 10 days, and thought having a place to cook would help, especially with making food for the babies. This hotel turned out to be awesome. I had been suspicious that the pictures were too good to be true for the price I was paying, but it looked the way it was presented. The rooms are large espeically for Paris with modern amenities. Each room has a bath/shower combo, and it's all very clean. The location is excellent, with two metro stations, a supermarket, a street market (travel writer Sandra Gustafsen's favorite street market), bakery, and restaurants within about a five minute walk. The only thing negative to note is that the towels are very thin, but that could be Paris, and one of the cleaning staff wasn't very thorough. Also, don't expect a lot of drawer space. We hung our clothes, but had to leave most in the suitcase on the floor.

My wife and daughter stayed in a studio apartment for two nights and loved it for its location and overall quality. The reception staff were also extremely helpful. The Terne and Charles de Gaulle Etoille Metros are nearby and the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees are walking distance. However, some negatives worth pointing out and perhaps the hotel and can improve on these: 1. We were told on the date of our travel to Paris that the plumbing had started leaking in the unit booked for us and so they had made alternate arrangements in a hotel on the same street. That Hotel (Hotel Flaubert) was nice and clean but with limited facilities and tiny rooms - clearly not what we were looking for. Add to that the headache of shifting the next day to the Residhotel. At 10 am the next day the apartment was still not ready so we left our luggage and went sightseeing. Though the hotel arranged the alternate accommodation within the same price I was surprised that they made no attempt to provide any compensation of some form as the standard was really not what I was looking for. 2. The other negative was the internet connection which refused to work on day 1 and then worked on day 2 when they replaced the internet adaptor (power outlet model) or did something. On day 3 it again did not work and all of this was quite tedious as I could not check my office email. They did offer for me to use their office computer but I did not opt for this. Would still go back if required as it is a good hotel on balance. One of the previous posts (from Australia) was quite helpful in terms of the cafes and the patisseries. In fact the almond croissants at the patisserie near the mono prix supermarket was superb. Highly recommended that you try this.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Fitchburg, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cNice neighborhood, room exactly as depicted\u201d", "Author": "m0909", "ReviewID": "UR17325891", "Content": "My parents and I had a four-night stay at the hotel. We arrived at the hotel at 1p, but the room was not ready yet, and I had to return to the hotel to get the room keys as the office was open until 8p. When I opened the door and looked at the room, it was exactly the one displayed on various booking websites. The floor was clean and the furniture was tidy; we stayed in room 3, and there was a small patio outside of our room. There was a double bed for my parents, the the sofa-bed was all to myself. The bathroom was well lit and clean, though the bath glass was only one-third the size of the tub (this turned out to be fairly common in France). The office of the hotel was in the building next door, and the lady and gentleman who worked there were very nice. You get a key for the room and two codes - one to enter the gate from the street, and another for the entrance door to the apartment. There is a fine bakery outside near the hotel, and many restaurants within walking distance on Avenue Niel, Avenue de Wagram, or near Place Mar\u00e9chal Juin. Getting to the hotel at night seems fairly safe - though there are a few bars in the neighborhood. The nearest supermarket is Monoprix on Avenue de Villiers, about a five-minute walk from the hotel. It opens at 9. There is also a coin-operated laundry on Rue Imp\u00e9rial. If you take the RER from the airport (changing from line B to A at Les Halles), I would recommend that you not switch again to metro line 2 if you have bags. I took the Avenue de Wagram exit and walked for about 15 to the hotel. The walk from Ternes (line 2) was about 5 minutes, but since there was no easy transfer from RER to line 2 at Charles de Gaulle-L'Etoile, I found it easier to be walking on surface streets. Taking the bus from the hotel is also easy. Bus routes 84 (to Panth\u00e9on), 92 (to Gare Montparnasse), and 93 (to Les Invalides) have stops near Place Mar\u00e9chal; routes 30 and 31 (to Gard de l'Est) run on Avenue de Wagram.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residhotel Imperial Rennequin", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d623107-Reviews-Residhotel_Imperial_Rennequin-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$177 - $296*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">34 rue Rennequin</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515285", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f7/16/f7162f0b7a7c896d19c67c1bde91e68a4large.jpg"}}
