The hotel is in a excellent location, and the building is beautiful. Upon arrival we were greeted by two gentlemen, who were very pleasant and helpful. They informed us that they had only recently taken over the hotel and that it needed a lot of work. We were given a small room with a double bed and shower. The shower was clean and so were the bedsheets, however, the carpet was very dirty and the wallpaper was dated. Considering we only paid \u00a345 for the night, we had no need to complain. We missed the breakfast in the morning, but checking out was easy and the jorney to the nearest tube was quick. I would only recommend this hotel for one night, and would advise the customer not to expect much. However, for a cheap hotel in london, it was not too bad. The other reviews that have been written are fair, but please remember that the hotel has changed hands recently and the new owners are trying their best to make the hotel better.", "Date": "January 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kent", "Title": "\u201cOh my God how disgusting!!!\u201d", "Author": "cheekydog", "ReviewID": "UR11092996", "Content": "This was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in - no hot water, no plug in the sink (so we went home as dirty as the hotel after 2 nights!), furniture crammed into a tiny room, no tea/coffee facilities, TV broken, and on a \u00a31 meter! The sheets were ripped and I couldn't sleep for fear the dirty bedspread and prison issue blanket would touch me! The hotel smelt, but they had poured super strong loo cleaner down the toilet to try & cover the smell.

We checked in, and checked straight back out again after just a few hours. The hotel has shared facilities, which were out of order when we arrived. We had booked an en suite room so we had our own shower and toilet. However, i would not want to use the shower and toilet, as they were absolutely disgusting, and looked like they had never been cleaned. The bedsheets were clean, but the extra pillows in the cupboard were badly stained, and were a horrible brown colour. The tv in the room was on a metre! There was a kettle and cups in the room...however, no tea or coffee! The carpet was disgusting and was in desperate need of a vacuum. When we left we told the staff member on duty why we were leaving and that we had to find somewhere else to stay. He had a bad attitude and seemed like he really did not care. He did offer another \"clean\" room but if the room we were in was anything to go by, i did not want to spend a moment longer in that hotel.

I have just spent a month backpacking around Thailand on a tight budget and I can honeslty say that the Manor Court was worse than anywhere I stayed when I was traveling. The staff are unfriendly and incompetent. Guests are required to leave their key at the front desk when they leave the hotel, and despite not having been informed of this I was reprimanded like a naughty child for not leaving my key. Breakfast consists of a pile of bread, some cheap cartons of orange juice and tea making facilities. Only 'served' between the hours of 7.30 and 8.30 it is best avoided. I can't say enough bad things about the rooms. There are wretch-worthy stains all over the walls, lampshades, carpets and linen. Nothing has been updated for decades. The bathroom smells absolutely disgusting - something which the owners are obviously aware of since they have gone to great efforts to place a cheap can of air freshener in the cell-like en suite. The shower curtain is mouldy, and quite fankly you'd get a more thorough wash by standing outside in the rain with a bottle of shampoo. The heating doesn't work and so even if you can manage to come to terms with lying under the rancid sheets you still wouldn't get a decent night's sleep as the room is so cold. Sadly, there are far too many hotels in London like this.

The hotel is offensive to each of the five senses; it looks vile, it smells vile, the breakfast tastes vile, the threadbare, bloodstained blankets made my skin crawl and we were kept awake all night by the noise of other guests who had turned to the bottle to numb their senses. The ensuite bathroom was a real treat. It was comprised of an archaic 'suite', a dribbling shower that wasn't attached to the wall and a free standing plank of wood manifesting itself as a door. The 'door' had to be lifted and lodged into place over the doorway by a secondary party when someone desired use of the hovel that was the bathroom. Inexplicable sticky brown stains adorned the walls, lampshades and carpets, the curtains were unattached to the railings and the radiator hung loose from the wall so we shivered at night because in hell, there is no heating . However, my favourite feature was unquestionably the little black pest- controller located under the sink. Strategically placed, I think, to offer a quick and humane death to any unfortuate specimen of vermon that may have found itself victim to the sensory assault that is the Manor Court. Sadly our suffering was a more prolonged affair; a five night agony to be more precise. I have been through some hard things in my life; the Manor Court was the hardest.
