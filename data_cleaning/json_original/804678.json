The window frames are a little loose and basically you are hearing the noise directly from the street. Just consider it as you are sleeping on street as far as noise concerned. But hey this is Kings Cross, the true center of night! If you are one of them (here to make noise), why would you complain about the noise from others. If you are looking for a peaceful nights, KIngs Cross is very wrong place to start with anyway. So, having all that said, hotel management takes your \"feedback\" with smile when you complain about the noise, and you will surely get some free ear plugs from them. To be fair, \"apartment features\" like the washing machine, kitchen, space... are OK.

Although the apartment is not specifically designed for children the management provided a good quality travel cot.

Provided the rates continue to offer excellent value, it will probably be my first choice when I next visit Sydney. The Good - Rooms are pleasingly modern, well-appointed and furnished - The manager (Adam) was friendly, courteous, and accommodating - Pleasant 20min walk to the city - Great cafe ('Uliveto') around the corner (which I visited on Adam's recommendation) - Free, fast and flawless wi-fi, which was very much appreciated The Bad - The noise levels at certain times: road noise during peak times and in the evenings, and the shouts of revellers leaving nearby pubs late on Fri & Sat nights. However: After my first night, I asked for earplugs from reception, and the rest of my nights I slept very soundly. Honestly, I believe that wearing earplugs completely negates this 'bad' point. Overall: A hidden gem that many people will pass over because of the noise.

I called the front desk to let them know the problem is the whole switch board as the kettle wouldn't work either. I asked if I could move into another room and he said no chance and the only option was to check out.. without any apologies for the ongoing issues ( I even bought my own light globes to fix the bathroom after the emergency line wasn't answered at night when it broke) I was treated with no respect and called 'darling' and it seemed it was a hassle for them to have me stay the whole week when really it was a hassle for me to deal with the ongoing issues of the apartment and disgraceful management.

My spacious studio was on the top (5th?) floor, and I had no trouble whatsoever with noise. I have stayed at far noisier and more expensive hotels in Sydney. In fact, given the location, one block behind \"the Coke sign\", I felt that it was relatively quiet. There is a great cafe around the corner for breakfast, and KC station is about 3 minutes walk away. Given that I had commitments in both directions (in Sydney's beaches, the CBD and in the inner west) this proved to be the perfect location for me. Unlike previous reviewers, I found the wireless internet to be faultless and an appreciated free service. Kitchen facilities were great and well appointed although seldom used by me.

Firstly, it's not actually Potts Point but technically Kings Cross. The area is dodgy if you travel alone I really don't recommend it. Reception won't take debit cards, credit only. And she tried to demand a $1000 charge off our cards each that would be \"refunded at end of stay\" yeah right. The receptionist was rude and her behaviour was downright disgusting - she treated us poorly from the moment there was a problem with us only have debit rather than credit cards even though we paid upfront. The bed sheets are scratchy and the pillows are like little lumps of cotton wool. The rooms are NOTHING like the photos on the website. The internet connection doesn't work. Buzzers from the intercom in rooms are disabled so you need to go downstairs to let your guests in and the reception is VERY inqusitive - she has asked both my friends who they are visiting and their full names - even though it's a 'serviced apartment' not a posh hotel and I believe thats not her business. The 'balconys' are 3 inches big.... you can't actually stand out on them. The doors don't shut properly and windows don't shut properly either so noise and cold comes through constantly. My room has a dodgy hallway thing that has a cupboard and creeps me out like someone is hiding down in the end of my room and the wind bangs against it constantly waking me up. I will NEVER stay here again. I have paid a $200 deposit and my stay in full for the next 3 days and I am afraid I'm just going to have to leave and not get anything back as I cannot stay in a place like this ever again. I'm missing home and a clean bed terribly. Do not stay here - the price is NOTHING at all worth what you are getting...

There is a nice enclosed balcony with a day bed in there - would have been nice of I'd been here during the day. Really - not bad for the price and location.

The bedroom was still very hot even after the aircon had been left on all day. - While there was a washing machine/dryer thing. There was no iron and ironing board. Where is the logic in that ? - The shower was not good.
