For me, they weren't deal breakers. Good points: Location - Perfect location to walk to some places. Colosseum is just about 2 blocks going one way and to the other side about a few blocks Vittorio Emanuelle monument. The metro is close either the colosseum or Cavour which is about a 5 min walk. There are also a few eating places. ROOM - Our room was big as well as the bathroom. Room was clean every day and we got new towels without asking. We also had a nice balcony view. Reception is 24 hours and they have beverages for sale (water, juices, soda etc) and cheap. Bottle of water only .50 euro. This was great coming back late at night or heading out in the hot weather in the morning. PRICE - For the location, I found the price to be reasonable. Now here are the points that might be cons for other travelers: Breakfast- There is no breakfast Reception: They don't speak much english, so depends who's in the desk. But I did get answers to my questions. Noise - Some of the days, the maid started cleaning rooms very early, so we heard the vaccuum before 9am. Not sure why they would start cleaning that early. Also, a couple of days we heard the Bells ringing from a church which rang 6 or 7 am. So if you like to have a great sleep, the bells might wake you up or the maid. But maybe if you as the reception not to turn the vacuum that early they might accomodate your request.

The room and the pension were very clean, bright and practical. Bathrooms and showers were very clean. I found the rooms to be above average in size compared to other European hotels/pensions. The inner courtyard and the pension staff, which is family owned, makes you feel as if you are staying with Italian friends. The inner courtyard, away from the bustle of the city, provided a serene refuge from the noise and enabled us to rest peacefully. There is no breakfast provided, but the continental breakfast provided at other hotels is poor, in my opinion. We had to extend our stay for a day, but Francesca with her always bright smile was able to change a few things and accommodate us for that extra night. We did have to change rooms for two out of the five nights to make this accommodation, but they moved us while we were sightseeing so as to not incovenience us. Typically, you would have to move yourself at any other hotel or pension. Francesca, her brother and mother were very helpful with suggestions and directions.

Francesca and her family were very helpful in answering our questions and giving us recommendations. She and her sister and brother all speak English. Her mother does not, but she's very nice as well and we were still able to chat even with my limited Italian! There is free wifi available in the lobby. The room that we stayed in wasn't very large but it was still comfortable and clean. The bathroom was a good size and we had a cute little balcony as well. The hot water did run out a couple times but we fixed that by just showering at different times. Looking at the hotel, to the left of it is a small food/sandwich/liquor shop which is a good place to pick up snacks and water (only 55 euro cents) for the day.

We were there to sightsee, not to hang out in a luxury hotel, so the size didn't matter. The price, $90 Euro was reasonable for such a good location in Rome.

You should try for a courtyard facing room, I did, but even though booking in March for September - they were all gone. My biggest like was the extremely helpful family who own/run the hotel and gave us good advice on restaurants etc and the LOCATION - you are so close to all the main attractions - except the Vatican. The station is a good 15 minutes walk straight up the Via Cavour - (has a good steak house if you tire of pasta and at reasonable prices). This is also where the tour bus terminus is. Security was quite good at the hotel, with guests having keys for street door, door into corridor where rooms are. You can leave your valuables at reception where they will be kept in the safe.

The hotel is basic... and if you're used to traveling through Europe, it's a typical 2 star hotel. (Interesting shower/toilet combo, no decorations, etc.). However, we travel on a budget, and love these cheap finds with a good location. Here are a few thoughts on our stay (April 2008): 1.) The location is terrific. Just a 3-4 minute walk to the Colleseum, Palantine Hill, etc. Two metro options are within a 5 minute walk (Colleseum and Cavour) and both of these options have a quick metro connection to Rome Termini station (1 Euro) 2.) My main issue with the hotel was the awful noise level from Cavour Road. We stayed in the quadruple room, which overlooked Cavour, which was FILLED with traffic - even at 4AM. Cars honking.... ambulances at all hours, and the scooters speeding by were surprisingly noisy. Most of us were still awake at 4AM, wishing we had ear plugs to drown out the noise. If the window was open, you could hardly hear another person talk across the room. It was awful. My husband is sleeps like a hibernating animal... and it even woke him up! However, all of the other rooms appeared to be either in the courtyard, or on the other side of our noisy room. So, if you are booking the quadruple room (#21), do not stay here. If you are booking any other room, I bet you won't have any of the noise problems. We were just unlucky with the room location & Carvour. (Or ask upon reserving the room to make sure you don't get room 21 - or a room overlooking Cavour.) 3.) The staff was willing to hold our luggage, which was a bonus. They also had a hairdryer available on request. 4.) Pay in cash... we asked before submitting payment on check-out, and they dropped the price by approx. 5%. 5.) There are a few good restaurants and a fantastic Gelato shop in the area (around the back corner). Do not go to the Cafe/Pizza/Gelato shop across from the hotel. VERY unfriendly and very pricey.

October is a great month to visit the eternal city as it is not too hot but the weather is sunny and pleasantly warm. The Rosetta is an absolute find as it's location is so hard to beat for the price. You are within easy walking distance of major attractions such as the Colosseum and right next door to the Forum. The Hotel is a small family run establishment and they have always been friendly and eager to please- looking after luggage on check-in and checkout days, arranging taxis etc. The rooms are basic but clean and comfortable with a TV and telephone. There is no safe in the room but staff happily take care of your valuables in their safe at the check-in desk. All staff are absolutely fantastic and try their best to help with whatever query you might have. Gianni gets our special recommendation as he is always so kind and patient with the children ( and us!) The room is cleaned and tidied every day to a high standard and fresh towels and toiletries provided. ( Though if you wish for designer soap/shampoo or you have very sensitive skin you had better bring your own). There are no tea/coffee making facilities in the rooms and if you are facing onto the busy Via Cavour it is noisy from the traffic which does not seem to abate even at night and if you have to open the window to get some fresh air it is even louder. Breakfast is not provided, but there is a great little cafe ( turn left from the main door onto the Via Cavour and walk up a little way) that serves delicious cakes and pastries and even coped with our poor grasp of the Italian language to give us hot tea complete with hastily improvised tin foil lids! You are lucky to have two great restaurants within a minutes walk- the Taverna dei Fori Imperiali (Via Madonna dei Monti, 16) which serves gorgeous food, including pasta that I continue to dream about- at very reasonable prices. They are also extremely friendly and accommodating to children. There is another restaurant in the same block as the Hotel ( I'm sorry but I do not recall the name but Gianni will give details-turn right from the main door that opens onto the Via Cavour and then immediately right again and walk to the end of the hotel block and the restaurant is on the corner). This restaurant is always packed with Italians and you might have to queue. The guy in charge seems a bit grumpy but traditional Italian dishes are served swiftly with the minimum of fuss and are very tasty and excellent value with the added bonus that after a hard day pounding the streets of Rome you do not have far to return to the Hotel! As for the sights of Rome they are just too numerous and wonderful to mention, but the location of this great little Hotel means that they are all virtually within easy walking distance without you being charged an exorbitant price for the privilege and convenience and it is a convenience to be near The Colosseum, The Baths of Caracalla, The Pantheon, The Forum, Palatine etc etc.These sites can all be visited from the Hotel without use of any public transport ( though this is too easily available). We loved the Pantheon, The Trevi Fountain, the Turtle Fountain, Giolotti's (which has a complicated system for purchasing the most mouthwatering gelati I have ever tasted-you pay at the till before going to the ice cream counter to choose your flavours and the waiters can be rather rude and do not tolerate any indecision), the sunday market in Trastevere,Parc de Borghese and the art in the Vatican ( do not miss the Caravaggio's in the Church bordering on the Piazza del Popolo) the slices of fresh pizza, authentic Roman fast food, I could go on and on but really Rome is simply stunning, there is so much to see and appreciate that a trip lasting a few days does not give you enough time- Rome really deserves all the superlatives ever written about it- the number of ancient and historical sites at virtually every corner means that it is a stunning city to visit.
