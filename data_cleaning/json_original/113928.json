In fact, I wanted to extend our stay, but my husband was the obstacle here. Otherwise would have stayed at least one or two more nights. The room, the view, the service, the comfort, the staff, the location, the decor, --even the onsite restaurant, Perry's, cozy and romantic, which we did not try because of previous reservations elsewhere, but intend to have dinner at next time-- made this one of my most memorable hotel stays. One I wish to repeat as often as I can! Olivia at front desk was lovely and assured us a great room. Even our housekeeper, May, who we met on check in and again at turndown service, was as lovely as everything else. My only concern with all this well-deserved high praise here is that we will have everyone wanting to stay here and it may be hard to book, or find the room we want not available for our next stay!", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "CAbirdy", "ReviewID": "UR126712716", "Content": "We booked a room thru a last minute deal site and weren't expecting much. Just glad to have a place on the Embarcadero, where we needed to stay. My daughter and I checked in about 8 pm and upon arriving at the front desk, the clerk asked if we were the two staying in the room. We said \"yes\" and she said-\"I am going to change rooms and get you a bigger bed.\" So that was nice---but then we got to our room and saw she had given us a suite-type room, with a beautiful terrace. It was on the fifth (top) floor and was huge by SF standards. It was quiet, clean and very comfortable. We had dinner at Perry's downstairs...food was average and typical SF expensive prices (artichoke appetizer was very tasty) but it's a beautiful view of the Bay bridge. Our waiter disappeared for much of our time there, but the manager was very helpful so despite the below-average service by our waiter I felt the manager helped make up for it.

Both made us feel welcome and Julio helped us with our public transportration questions. Both of these folks were knowledgable and took the time to see if we needed anything to make our stay perfect. Our room was 218 overlooking the bay. It was a beautiful view but for an additional $80+ I would rethink it next time. As we were on the 2nd floor facing the bay and the street we really couldn't open the windows. There was absolutely no privacy to leave the curtains open. For one night stay and few opportunities to really enjoy the view it really was wasted on us. Back to our room. It was absolutely lovely, very small, but very well thought out and had everything we needed. It was immaculate. Our bed was comfortable and the room was \" pin drop\" quiet even though we were facing the street. The compact size was not a problem for us as we have traveled extensively in Europe and it is the norm. The hotel itself is in a great location a block away to public transportation capable of getting you just about anywhere in the city you need to go. Julio parked our car and we spent the rest of our visit using the street cars and two cab rides. This morning, Saturday, we walked over to the Ferry Building and shopped at the farmers market and craft fair, had a great breakfast on a bench with a bunch of other early risers and walked a block back to the hotel to get our car and head back to the delta.

The Griffon has an awesome history and story and its location in the Bay area, in the heart of everything, makes it a popular place to stay. On first appearances the hotel, its distinct style (oriental impressions) and trendy, unpretentious vibe is indeed a winner, even if it is small. On closer inspection though, things start to crop up that make you reconsider whether this place is worth the money; First thing- The hotel's front doors are always open. Trust me Brothers and Sisters, this is NOT a good idea; the smell of sewerage from the street invades the lobby and lingers around like an unwanted guest. What is even worse is the fact that the hotel's restaurant is right beside the lobby. Imagine getting a whiff of that as you sip your pinot and dig into your 'Catch Of The Day'...yummmmmmm. Second- The rooms are small, as in, you literally cannot swing a cat in there (though beautifully designed) and poorly ventilated. The carpets smell musty and the window seat looks a little worn out and it sits above the super loud AC unit. Third- I dont know about anyone else, but my window (on the third floor) was facing what i think was the fire escape (the window was foggy and made with that thick textured glass makes everything outside look all distorted like). So in addition to having no view, I also had no natural light coming into my room. I'm telling you, i would leave my room at around 8am, thinking it was gloomy outside because it was so dark in there. Imagine my surprise when i noticed that it was sunny outside! The interior designer here was a clever one because to counter the gloom in the room, they installed an artificial 'natural light' just above the bed, to make dim wits like me feel like it was sunlight shining down from the heavens onto my face. Needless to say, when i discovered otherwise (i.e. a whole 5 minutes after coming into the room for the first time) i seriously was not impressed. Fourth- The price was too high for such a small room, with musty carpets and no breakfast. I am especially cross about the no breakfast thing though. I am guessing, no, I am positive that guests at this hotel are actually paying for the location and the concept of awesomeness. I will admit that from the looks of things, this hotel does have a certain charm to it, but i WILL NOT be caught paying this much for a hotel that clearly needs an upgrade, a facelift and some love.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPretty good Value\u201d", "Author": "JustJanetPhoenix", "ReviewID": "UR120307078", "Content": "On the advice of fellow trip advisors, I asked for a view of the bay when I arrived at the hotel. The check-in clerk was happy to accomodate and this really made the stay. The room was very small, it had a king bed but I was traveling solo and it was a good thing, because I think two people in a room that size would have been very cramped. This is a good hotel to stay in for the location, it is close to the Ferry Building which has wonderful shops and food emporia and a farmer's market on the weekends. It is also walking distance to North Beach where I visited City Lights Bookstore and SOMA is close too where I visited the SFMOMA. The hotel has Perry's restaurant inside which is a very good restaurant. I enjoyed their chili immensely on a cold rainy day. Hotel staff provided great directions to and from the BART which cost me $6.80 each way to/from Oakland airport. That saved me a bundle over an estimated $60 taxi fare. The carpet in the room is a dark orange color and is just ugly and the people above me were a tad noisy. I should have complained about the noise but didn't so that is my fault.

I informed her of our stay and she told me there were no rooms ready. I said okay and asked about having our car parked and if we needed to access the car during our stay could we. She could not tell me where they parked the car and said they could only get it for us and it would take 15 to 20 minutes to get the car. We took our luggage out of the car and John (the only nice person) took our car to the unknown lot. We thought we would just wait in the lobby till our room was ready. After waiting only a few minutes Matt the manager called us to the desk to let us know a room was ready. We went to the room which had a maintenance man fixing a light fixture in the bathroom and a drilling noise that made the walls shake. I went back to the lobby to ask about a room without drilling and possibly not a maintenance man. The same young lady, Julia, was at the desk and told me there were no rooms without the drilling available for our stay. I asked to speak to Matt the manager. She told me to go back to the room and he would call. A few minutes later Matt called and said there were no rooms that did not have the drilling and not to worry as it only goes from 10 am to 5 pm. I told him we would leave then and he said fine to go ahead and leave as he could not help us. There were no apologies and no attempts to solve the problem.No I am sorry let's try and work this out. He just told us to leave. We gathered all our stuff, went downstairs and I told them how unhappy I was and that the room was not ready that there was someone in the room fixing a light.

If you are looking for resort accommodations or an expansive suite, it will not work for you. But if you're comfortable with a quaint and quirky boutique experience, close to the Embarcadero and AT&T Park, this is a viable option at a reasonable price point. Just stayed two nites in a deluxe king room. As other T/A reviewers have commented, this room is very small, if not bordering on tiny. I did not have a tape measure but I guesstimate it was no more than 200sf, with a 7' x 6' bathroom carve out housing a tub/shower and toilet. The low sink/vanity are in the sleeping space, as well as the king bed, two nite stands and a desk, so there is little room to move about. The TV is a good size flatscreen with Comcast CableCard, but it is mounted way above the vanity near the ceiling in an awkward viewing position-- too bad because a simple swivel stantion would fix this. There is also a small refrigerator under the vanity, and a coffee maker too. The rest of the quirkiness vibe continues with a light well window that berths a small bench seat, which really becomes a luggage rack as there is no other space to stow besides a small, open closet. There is no dresser, and drawer storage is limited to two, tiny, floor level drawers in the window seat and the nite stands. Oh and don't miss the lighted sconce above the toilet, which faces a long, door-mounted mirror so you can watch yourself as nature calls! Some T/A reviewers have commented about a musty smell, but there is an awning window high above the right corner panel of the light well that you can crank open. The downside is you will hear pidgeon warbling very early in the morning if you do, On the quaint side, this is a 100+ year old building, with a long history that goes back to the barbary coast days and an owner who was a bootlegger. The elevator is 30\" wide, cramped, and slow,,,,,so take the steps and wind up in the bar! And for the eco-types, score bonus points for sustainable design, environmental, and energy efficiency initiatives that were purportedly enhanced in a 2007 renovation, albeit I was suprised by a sliding thermostat relic for the HVAC. The exposed brick wall is also obtrusive, and if I were management, I'd slap a nice wall mirror on it to open up the room.

I wanted a classic SF boutique hotel in an awesome location. Hotel Griffon was that and much, much more! First I did my internet research and made a call to check on rooms and rates. Matt, was so incredibly nice and helpful that I decided to stop by and check the place out. The warm and inviting atmosphere of the lobby and adjoining bar and restaurant are hard to describe. You just get a really friendly and inviting feeling upon entering the hotel. Each staff member we met was just as wonderful as Matt. The location on the Embarcadero across from the Ferry Building is ideal! There are plenty of restaurants close by, it's centrally located for walking and there is a YMCA two doors down. Perry's Restaurant, on the ground floor of the hotel, is fantastic. They offer a full menu of really reasonably priced entrees, something for everyone. We ended up having two dinners and one breakfast at Perry's; it's really convenient! I highly recommend the Bay View Suite; it's very spacious with a great layout of a bedroom area and separate living room space with killer views of the Bay, Bay Bridge and Ferry Building. The standard rooms offer the same view and would be fantastic if you don't plan on too much hanging out in the room. We chose the suite which worked out perfectly for the two of us and my parents to have a drink and hang out before dinners. I will definitely book a room for my parent's next annual visit as well as recommend this gem of a boutique hotel to other friends and family! To recap: * Wonderfully helpful and friendly staff (Matt was great!). * Classic SF boutique hotel; a gem. * Perfect location; convenient, safe, great area to walk and explore, plenty of restaurants. * Convenient restaurant and bar in hotel. * Bay View suite is really spacious, great layout, killer views.

The amenities were all GREEN and sustainable, and we appreciated that the mini-bar was full of locally selected and organic items. The bed was excellent, and the flat-screen TV was positioned high on the wall so we could lie in bed and watch all the shows we were missing- as if we were in our own house.

I have travelled for many years to many countries and I always judge a hotel for what I get for my money. I paid $309 a night (plus taxes) for the smallest hotel room that I have ever stayed in in North America. The room had a double bed and there was just enough room to walk around it and that was the entire room. The sink was in the room and the bathroom consisted of a toilet and very small bathtub. The television was hung from the ceiling because there was not enough wall space for it. If you like character then this hotel has plenty of it. The floor slopped so much from door to window (that looked at a brick wall 5 feet away) that it actually made me feel a bit dizzy, like a slopping floor at a carnival fun house. I estimate the floor must have had a good 9 inches of slope across its 9 foot width. I checked the map on the back of the door that showed the room layout for all the rooms on my floor. Of the 18 rooms, 2 had a view of the water, 2 had a view of the back street, 2 were next to either the elevator or stairs and 4 were the very tiny ones like I had. If you don't have a view of the water or the back street then you will not get a view unless you count looking at a brick wall 5 feet away in the fire escape. When I checked into this hotel they made me initial a form saying that they would charge me $50 a night for every night that I left early. That should have been a strong clue that something was amiss. I have only ever been asked that once before and it was at a place that I did want to leave early.

I had to ask twice for the car to be parked -- I was tired, it was almost midnight and the neighborhood was new to me. There was no bellman, no greeter. The next morning, when 9 a.m. and the end of the complimentary breakfast arrived, the cleaning crew swooped all the food, coffee and hot water away, and took the guests' plates, etc. even though several people were still enjoying coffee with a newspaper, etc. The staff didn't ask if anyone wanted more coffee, or leave the coffee for refills.

Pros: Cute, historic charm. Nice exposed brick wall in room and great Aveda bath products. Good location, although we usually had to walk a block or two to get a cab. Continental breakfast was nice. Everything appeared very clean. I requested more towels and they were sent up quickly. We were very impressed with all of the staff, including the front desk, in the restaurant, and at breakfast. Cons: Many people said small rooms, which usually don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me, but our room was beyond small. I actually felt a little claustrophobic because the window looked out into a very small, dark, dirty brick cave-like hole. There are also very few king beds because many of the rooms are too small to accommodate them. Despite booking months in advance and requesting a king bed multiple times, I could only get a full bed. The rooms must also be all different sizes because I was with other people who paid the same rate and both had slightly larger rooms so you may get the luck of the draw on your room. The sink and mirror in the room was a little strange but at least there was good counter space. The location of the TV mounted on the wall was just too high and awkward. The bed and linens were below average and the pillows were definitely very old, as they were extremely flat. The shower had very low water pressure. In fact, I think the sink faucet had more water flow and pressure than the shower. I was on the third floor, close to the elevator and the stairs, right above the fireplace downstairs and there was a definite smell in the hallway that other people wrote about, but I couldn't smell it in the room. I could however, very clearly hear every word being spoken in the hallway, even when I could tell that people were trying to be quiet. There was also a substantial gap between the door and the floor which let in a lot of light in the night. Lastly, the temperature controls were not very good. Sometimes the room was too hot and sometimes too cold and the basic warm/cool control in the room did very little to change the temperature. Verdict: Hotel Griffon tries very hard, but is average. It is probably better to stay in an upgraded, guaranteed King room with a view, but for those prices I would just stay somewhere else, especially with two people in a room.

There is only one major complaint I have regarding this hotel. Although they have indoor parking at a price, it is a good block away and, worse than that, it is the most cramped, horrible, parking environment I have ever encountered in a parking garage. Without maneuvering several different times you cannot get into or out of any of the spaces. That being said, if you don't have a car to park, The Griffon is an okay hotel, but I think you could do better for the money.

Overall, I had a nice stay, though this hotel is a bit quirky. I was booked into room 411. This room features a queen size bed and small couch in an L shaped room.

Somewhat to be expected for an old hotel, but the room noticably slants uphill towards the bed. So much, in fact, that the nightstand and desk drawers do not stay shut. Another oddity is that the television is mounted very high on the wall. It makes for awkward viewing and craning your neck. This room may not be ideal for a longer stay because there is no dresser in the room. If I had to choose between a couch or a dresser, I would have probably picked a dresser because the location of the couch does not allow you to watch television. Oh, and because of the couch, the closet door does not open all the way. There was no iron or ironing board in the room, but when I called for one, it was promptly delivered.
