Having stayed at the Swissotel Merchant Court in Singapore I was pleased when I got the Sydney location. Whilst the room was not as nice as the one in Singapore, the staff were just as friendly and it was bigger. The bathroom (clean and tidy) was bigger than some hotel rooms I have stayed in recently. The toiletries provided were less and of less quality than what was available in Singapore, but still enough for the one night. The bed was on the harder side, which might not be to some peoples taste, but I slept very well on it. Had the Chicken Schnitzel for room service dinner. Service was prompt and the food was tasty. The schnitzel was very well cooked and a very dark brown crust, which is exactly how I like it, but I know my wife would consider it over-cooked.

However, we were more than pleasantly surprised with the Swissotel. First of all, it's in a great location, practically across from the Queen Victoria Building which means it is very convenient to the Town Hall train station. Second, the staff couldn't be more accommodating. The bellmen do double duty as concierge when the latter have not come on duty (and even when they have). The rooms are very comfortable, and we had great views of the city when we were upgraded to the executive floor. My only complaint would be that the breakfast hours are chaotic. There seems to be plenty of staff, but disorganization is evident regardless of the time that you go. We had to track down our own tea and coffee which was often quite cold by the time we poured it from the pitchers. The food in the buffet was allowed to all but disappear before a new tray is brought out, requiring us to wait for a new platter of fruit or bacon. Used dishes were seldom cleared from the table in a timely fashion; we resorted to piling them up on an adjacent table. The staff were very nice but terribly inefficient from our perspective. We were there for 4 days so had plenty of time to experience breakfast at different times and with different occupancy (which was never very full). Given that the breakfast is $25-$35 a day (depending on whether you pre-purchase or not when you check in), we felt that this was not good value. We only booked the breakfast for convenience and would probably not do it again in the future.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "sussex", "Title": "\u201cService with a smile\u201d", "Author": "simonSussex", "ReviewID": "UR127532220", "Content": "From check in to the end of our stay everything was a breeze.

I live in Sydney but wanted a Shopping and Spa weekend for my birthday and this is the best location for it as Pitt Street Mall is literally underneath you! If you are from out of town looking to conveniently walk around Sydney then this is a good location, the bus stops and train stations are also close. Service, staff and rooms were above average actually better than what I expected. The Club Floor breakfast and cocktails were great and must say maybe one of the best I've had in terms of variety and quality of food served. There are only 2 things I would say failed to meet expectations: 1. We had an issue with room service. We ordered pizza and some dessert for dinner on one of the nights of our stay and we requested that the dessert be served maybe 15 mins after the main. It came all at once and we nicely reiterated that we requested the dessert to come later and the staff happily took it back. When it was served again, they gave us the same dessert melted and obviously put back in the freezer till it was served again! We politely complained about this and after going back and forth in calls finally a different person turned up on our door to apologise and offer us a drink if we wanted it. To be honest I think it was just a lack of communication between the person answering the phones and the people actually preparing the meals. 2. The Amrita Spa experience was a bit lack lustre. I booked the last appointment of the day for a Deluxe Chocolate Scrub. The spa receptionist was not really happy to see me when I walked in (she actually looked surprised!) and I felt rushed during the treatment. After the treatment finished and I was trying to relax before I got up and the therapist (Rose) actually whispered in my ear that I should get up as people need to get home! They also ran out of chocolate for my scrub and said they would use coffee instead. It would have been better if they rang me in advance to let me know this instead of hijacking me on the spot. Moral of the story do not book last appointments. I would stay at the Swissotel Sydney again given its location, great rooms and overall great staff. But I would stay away from the Spa!

We live in Sydney but as it was my birthday (a significant milestone one!) we wanted to do something a bit different and we chose Swissotel due to the proximity to the State Theatre and shopping. The service and warmth from the staff - starting with my experience with the friendly telephone booking agent a few weeks ago, to checking in on a very busy Saturday afternoon (where staff moved quickly and efficiently but still taking time to be friendly and interested), and even the brief chats to staff in corridors or lifts - was consistent, friendly and sincere. I was made to feel very special as it was my birthday, and we were given a beautiful room on the 25th floor as well as - to my surprise and delight - a bottle of champagne and a lovely card from management. We were amazed at this generous gesture from management to a guest who has never stayed at the hotel before. We were also given a late check out the next day, which was very welcome on the morning of my birthday! The room was large, clean and well maintained. The beds and pillows were wonderfully comfortable, and there were plenty of towels, face washers, coat hangers and toiletries (I have noticed good hotels starting to really scrimp on these things lately, no doubt due to pilfering), and the coffee machine was a real bonus. We had a delicious room service lunch that arrived quickly and still nice and warm, although it would have been good to have a children's menu. We also had the buffet breakfast the next morning which is one of the best I've ever been to. There was plenty of food being regularly refreshed, even though we arrived quite late in the session - the 'live' kitchen for eggs and omlettes etc was great and there were plenty of tasty, fresh choices which kept all of us going back to the tables time and again. We felt very welcomed by all the staff and I personally felt very special with the extra attention I was so kindly given by everyone. The staff really went the extra mile for us and I will certainly be coming back to this wonderful hotel, and recommending it to friends as a fabulous choice for Sydney any time.

It was almost as if we weren't in the same hotel when you were on the inside of the room. We could have been in a country motel. The blinds were broken. The bed was old. The furniture was worn. The bathroom was clean but needed a bit of a make over,although it seemed newer than the rest of the room so it wasn't too bad. Separate bath. Very small shower. Rooms didn't really meet the standard of the rest of the hotel. So that has brought my score down to average, from what would have been well above average for most almost everything else.

They rate themself as 5 stars and thats the problem - they had to rate themself. I booked the the hotel on a discount web based hotel booking site and saved heaps off their $600 rack rate. That I suggest is the issue in part. The discounted rooms customers are made to wait in line for rooms at check in my opinion. There are many reviews that highlight the fact the the hotel simply doesn't have the 5 star feel - and I agree 100%. On the street level you walk into what is bascially a lift well which brings you to a 8th level lobby as the hotel is built on top of the Pitt Street Mall Westfield. My daughter and I walked in a bit early (1pm) and checked in being advised we were on a priority queue. I left to return about 1.45pm to be advised our room was not ready yet but to rest assured that our luggage was in our room. Check is listed as 2pm and after already speaking to 3 staff from 1pm I confronted staff again at 2.30pm. I asked what the status of my room was once again and was told my booking had a request of a King Bed which was the cause of the delay. I blew up advising the lady that I booked and payed over a week ago and checked in over 1.5 hours ago and I wanted my room. She looked at me like ..... what do you want me to do. I simply demanded the manager and a guy standing right beside her spoke up. Again I demaned my room stating check in was 2pm he said oh ... oh and said he'd up grade my room and asked me to wait again. Not a good start what so ever. The room I was given was not 5 star. Water in shower was either boiling or cold and no pressure. The towel rack was broken off the wall (and I thought for sure they'd bill me somehow) the coat rack as well. The view of this \"upgraded\" room was the roof top of the centre point tower. My question is what was my original room going to be back. The real issue was the fact that on my check in day heaps of people were checking in - why not me? The next day I saw many others check in.

Booked one night on a secret hotel deal. First impression of this hotel is one of shear chaos. No proper setdown lane so you need to park the car in a \"no parking\" zone on Market St. We weren't received by anyone so we didn't have any help with luggage. Enter into the small business-like foyer and the concierge gives you a choice of $55 valet parking or Kent St parking costing $35 With the worry of getting booked and trying to work out where the parking station on Kent St was, we went valet. The main reception on level 8. Arrived after the 2.00pm check-in but the room wasn't ready. It was suggested that we wait at the drinks lounge on level 24. We went up but didn't see anyone. 2.45pm and still no room so our plans for the day were already being disrupted. A room was finally ready but it was on level 11 which was a disappointment because earlier we were told it was on level 16. The room itself was miserable as it's probably the lowest level in the hotel for accomodation. The room is marred by the half height window and to make it worse, most of the view out of the window is of a concrete parapet. I noticed the smell straight away. Definitely cigarette smoke. It was faint but if you're a non smoker it's untolerable. We had kids so that wouldn't do. I enquired and fortunately the staff were able to find another room for us. One would soon be available on level 19 but we had to wait again. It was well worth it though, we finally had a nice room with a view and we could breathe. The bathroom has everything you need and looks like it's been recently refurbished. Overal a great room. Only complaint would be that the mattress was too firm and the carpets needed a proper vaccuum. I remember, tissue in hand, I went to sweep something off the carpet and collected a bonus handful of hair and dust. Yuck. Checking out was far worse then checking in. We were initially told that Valet parking was under the hotel and we could leave the car for a while and pick it up later on in the day. Not that simple though. It turned out that our car was parked in Kent St so there was no way that we could use the car to store any of the bags we were carrying. The concierge half-heartedly suggested that we leave our bags in the hotel but after seeing the mountain of luggage around him, we weren't comfortable with that. The chaos continued as we waited forever for the valet to return with our car. There was no parking available in the \"no parking\" zones out front. Horns were blowing as we stopped traffic on Market St to hastily throw the luggage in the boot and say goodbye and good riddance. Our plans for the day in tatters. 5 stars.....who are you kidding? I'd give it only 1 if we were forced to stay in that miserable room on level 11. It passes with 3 stars as the room on level 19 was nice. Advice to others: Make absolutely sure that you are staying on a higher level. Don't count on your room being ready at the 2.00pm check-in. Don't take your own car to this hotel.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool", "Title": "\u201cAmazing High Tea!!!\u201d", "Author": "Rebecca M", "ReviewID": "UR123425992", "Content": "My work collegues throw a Congratulations on Your Engagement High Tea for myself and another recently engaged colleague.

I booked a Swiss Advantage room and buffet breakfast was included in the package. POSITIVES: We arrived at the Hotel just before midday. Hotel check-in time is 2pm. Went to reception to check-in and were told that our room was ready and we could have access to it straight away. The Swiss Advantage room we had is a step up from the base room called a Classic room. Our room was spacious, clean and well appointed. We had great views from the large window which provided plenty of natural light. I mention the natural light because I have found that many Sydney hotel rooms are very dark because of a lack of natural light. The bathroom was very large with a separate shower and bath. The bathroom was very modern with good quality amenities. The bed was very comfortable and the room quiet. We both slept very well. In my opinion this is the best located hotel in Sydney. Because I was running the City to Surf the hotel was convenient because it was very close to Hyde Park. The Swissotel is also close to St James Station and a short walk to Darling Harbour. My wife loves the location because it is ideal for shopping as it is right in the heart of the CBD. NEGATIVES: Half an hour after we arrived to our room our suitcases had not arrived. I rang the concierge to find out what had happened to our luggage. They said that they were busy and that bags would be delivered to our room shortly. After another 10 minutes they still hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t arrived. So my wife suggested that I go down and collect them myself. So I had to go down two lifts to collect them. And just as well I did because they were still sitting there with a whole lot of other suitcases. If I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t of collected them myself, who knows how long we would have waited. The hair dryer was missing from the bathroom. My wife rang housekeeping at approximately 11am and requested a hair dryer. She was given an apology for the hair dryer not being there and was told that one would be put in the room soon. When we returned to our room later that night (around 8:30pm), there was still no hair dryer. It took another phone call to have the hair dryer sent to our room. On the Sunday morning I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the buffet breakfast because I was running the City to Surf. However my wife did have the breakfast at the Jpb restaurant on her own and said that it was fine. On the Monday morning we both had the buffet breakfast and I was disappointed. Firstly there was one particular staff member who was extremely rude not just to us but also other patrons. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how this young lady was allowed to work at a 5 star hotel. The table we were given was dirty and hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been cleaned after the previous persons had eaten. I requested to be moved to another table and this particular young lady wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happy but moved us anyway. This time the table was clean but the seats were full of crumbs and mess. In addition to the poor service and lack of cleanliness, the selection of food was average, but not as good as most other 5 star hotels I have stayed at. We also stayed at this hotel the previous 2 years for the City to Surf. In the last year the price of the Swissotel has skyrocketed. In 2009 and 2010 was paid approximately $210/night in a Swiss Advantage room with breakfast. In 2011 we paid nearly $300/night. SUMMARY This is a hotel with enormous potential because of its excellent location and spacious, well appointed rooms. This hotel was not so long ago ranked in the top 20 on Tripadvisor and now at the time of writing it is ranked 33rd. The Swissotel Sydney is a much better hotel than its 33rd ranking. However, it does have some shortcomings. If the relevant improvements are made then this Hotel could easily be one of the top 5 in Sydney.", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sao Paulo", "Title": "\u201cAtention, there is no actual photos of the hotel\u201d", "Author": "MrMoreira", "ReviewID": "UR123414012", "Content": "This hotel has a graphic treatment on the internet and presented no photos of the rooms.

We'd caught the train from Newcastle to avoid Sydney traffic & easily walked the 2 blocks from St James station. The concierge stopped us as we were heading upstairs to tell us he would take care of our bags. As we were checking in early he said he would have them sent up once we had a room assigned (and he did). At check-in we were upgraded to an executive floor and it was fabulous. Great room, extremely well appointed and even though the view was mostly tops of cranes & buildings on a rainy Sydney day we could see snatches of Darling Harbour and we were looking down on the city. Huge comfy bed, pillow menu, large bathroom with separate bath, shower and stylish swissotel branded toiletries. We also had a Nespresso coffee machine in our room. We had free drinks (a range of Nespresso coffee/tea/soft drinks/spirits and wines - self service) and canapes (hot and cold, savoury and sweet) in the executive lounge, made use of the free internet (there's also broadband and wireless in the room for a cost). There was also a smokers balcony if you were so inclined. As we were heading to the Opera House for a 6.30 show canapes were perfect so we could wait to eat after the show. The staff in the executive lounge were professional and helpful. We witnessed several instances where they were providing quality service to arriving guests. After a great night's sleep we had breakfast in the lounge the following morning and again the standard was good. I particularly liked the honeycomb in a frame dripping honey into a jug although I wouldn't like to have stood there waiting for enough for my toast! The only tiny problem was with our bags as we left. After using the express checkout (drop the door cards in a provided envelop into the lounge) we left our bags with the concierge to walk the 50m for shopping in Westfields and through to the QVB. When we got back to the desk it was apparent lots of people had the same idea as us and there were bags piled everywhere. The concierge looked and couldn't find the bags, he then sent someone upstairs to look while he looked again and finally he asked my partner into the back room to look. Eventually sanity prevailed and I was asked to look - the bags were there even though three men had failed to see them. He was very apologetic and to be fair he was extremely busy but some kind of distinguishing tag on our part may have helped him locate the bags more quickly. Oh and there are two lifts and a lobby walk to get up to the rooms - but hey - no complaints from us...incidental exercise is supposed to be good for us.

The staff working in the Executive lounge are knowledgeable, friendly and go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your stay and I can't speak highly enough of them.

You won't find a hotel located closer to shopping than this one - the Hilton is the next best located, but having stayed at The Hilton last year, I can honestly say this one is better. It has much bigger rooms (particularly if staying on the Exec. level), the beds have a pillow menu and are comfortable (we had 2 doubles by choice, but otherwise the standard is a KS bed). The rooms are quiet, ours had a Nespresso coffee machine, safe and flat screen TV. The bathroom accessories were regularly replenished and the room was spotless. The room-service menu is expensive however, so we only did this once - but in Sydney there are so many options that you can always find something with a short walk - Sunday evenings being a slight exception. The reception is actually on level 8, so the ground floor is only a small opening where the porters are located - to check in you take the lift to the 8th floor, then another lift to your room. I will definitely return to this hotel - the best I have stayed in so far in my travels to Sydney. I stayed here in December 2011 - it is a 10 minute walk to the train station, and then about 6 stops to the airport - about an $18 ride but much cheaper than a taxi and very direct. You can walk under cover via the Queen Vic building, which is full of shops, or via the streets above.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel\u201d", "Author": "Caroline861", "ReviewID": "UR122704275", "Content": "Just stayed at the Swissotel, what a beautiful hotel.

Ideal location for overseas visitors. We stayed in a junior suite with club benefits (canapes and drinks between 5.30-7.30pm) and breakfast provided in the club lounge - located on a high floor, the lounge provided good city skyline views towards Darling Harbour. While the selection of canapes was a bit limited (two hot selections, cheese platter and basic tapas) it was ample - good selection of drinks including champagne, wine, beer, spirits and other non-alco beverages which was all self serve - and the supply of food and drink was efficiently replenished by a very courteous and friendly attendant. Breakfast was a big surprise - including continental, fruit, cereals and bircher muesli plus a complete hot breakfast (eggs, potato hash, sausages, bacon etc) Our junior suite was on the top level with an expansive view over the city - spotlessly clean and everything worked (except one TV which was quickly fixed after asking). Large bathroom - oddly shaped, small lounge - good size bedroom. Bed was very comfortable. Courteous service really stood out - from the concierge and reception to the club lounge attendants and the cleaners - they have all been drilled to acknowledge guests and make an effort to be pleasant.

The only slight complaint I have that there was no power point in the bathroom. Although there was one in the entrance near a full length mirror. The bed was much harder than I anticipated, but surprisingly comfortable. The pillow selection was fantastic. Linen was uninspiring.

Some of the things that should be looked at (since in another response the hotel has marked they are looking at a refurb) include: * Glass topped desks are a problem for a mouse - maybe have a mouse pad available (you can incorporate advertising if need be) * Having the desk chair facing into the room is not great - should look out instead of in which would also then allow you to watch the tv if need be * TV Channels - please, why are there three with advertising on them (hotel, room service and Sydney) !. For those of us that work late into the night and early morning, having the tv on is normal., However when the channels are so limited (no digital and only 2 non-sport/news satellite channels) and very male orientated, it just becomes a bone of contention. * The Bed - not having a top sheet was very strange and actually not sure I was overly comfortable with it. One other noticeable area was the Reception desk, while there are four computers, there was normally two staff on and there were periods of the day when trying to walk past to get to the lifts was extremely difficult because of the backup of people waiting to be served.

We needed somewhere for a good nights' sleep before starting a long flight early on Monday morning. Our expectations weren't high to begin with, but we were completely shocked at how bad our experience was. Check in was so-so. The clerk couldn't find our reservation and broke off in the middle of helping us to attend to a very pushy guest who needed attention immediately. OK.... The room was clean and a decent size but outdated and with very pedestrian decor. Despite the reservation and the extra charge for our son to stay in the room with us, only 2 skimpy towels were provided. When we called housekeeping another cheap little towel was promptly delivered. it seemed odd that the Swissotel should be so stingy with towels - but no big deal. There was nowhere convenient to eat dinner outside of the hotel as it was a Sunday night. Our only options in the hotel were the bar area or room service. We opted for the bar thinking it would be quicker. We waited 10 minutes while our waiter ignored us and chatted with her friends. When I finally asked for a menu she was friendly and pleasant enough. Whatever - Australia is not famous for it's good service. Back to the room and off to sleep and everything was fine for a half hour. Then all of a sudden the room lights started flashing on and off. We fiddled with the key card that controlled the lights and finally got all the lights to stay off. And finally went back to sleep. Half an hour later the same thing happened. We called the front desk who sent someone from engineering. He told us to take the key card out and that would ensure that the lights wouldn't come on again. He was right. But when our alarm went off at 4am and we inserted the card to turn on the lights, we were back to disco flashing lights in the bedroom and none in the bathroom. After enduring this nonsense for twenty minutes while trying to pack and get ready to leave, we finally tried our second key card and everything was fine for our last five minutes at the hotel. If only we had been told on the phone or by the engineer that it was a problem with the card, we could have used the other one all along, or had the bad one reprogrammed. I informed the night manager as we left the hotel and he offered a lukewarm and tired apology. After getting home and having some time to cool off, I got in touch with the hotel and suggested a refund or free accommodation at a Swissotel as fair compensation. In the end I was finally offered a free nights accommodation but only valid for the same hotel. If I ever find myself in Sydney again and I have time, I might take them up on it. But I will never ever pay to stay at a Swissotel anywhere else ever again. Apologies are cheap and the Swissotel in Sydney is generous with them. But it's no way to run a business. How about investing in updates including your silly lighting system, and training your staff properly? Maybe then you wouldn't need to spend so much time apologizing to ticked off customers, and you could concentrate on running a decent hotel.", "Date": "October 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wolllongong", "Title": "\u201cFine.\u201d", "Author": "oliver86", "ReviewID": "UR119735834", "Content": "My title probably implies my sentiment: it was adequate accommodation and nothing more.

The waitresses just walk past and egnore plates that need to be taken away not once but a few times regularly, really annoying to say the least and we got quite fed up of having to ask the staff.

The food is ok but often cold, we witnessed a guest complaining about the food being cold. On a positive the young man that greeted us for breakfast was always very cheerfull and polite and it's a shame all the other staff let him down!

The location, in central Sydney, is brilliant - right next door to the fabulous Victoria Arcade which has some splendid shops (though the prices, as for the whole of Australia, are steep), and only about five minutes' walk from Darling Harbour. Our room, too, was fine - a comfortable bed (in many ways the most important thing), quietly located and kitted out with all the things you'd expect to find in a five-star hotel. But it was all the other bits which made us feel irritable. First, the entrance to the hotel is a dingy concierge doorway in Market Street, not at all impressive. Second,you must then travel up eight floors to the lobby and the reception area - which is a depressing mixture of brown and minimalist furniture, with lots of empty space, no welcoming colours and a lift (a different lift) that takes you up to the floor where your room is located. The staff are officious and seem to have trouble telling their left from their right, because we were told that the lift was on our right when in fact it wasn't. In the room we found that instead of curtains the windows are covered with functional blinds in an objectionable shade of brown - perhaps this group has decided to follow the mantra that any potentially exciting or dramatic colours might upset someone, so they've opted instead for a sort of uniform drabness. The breakfast is a total rip-off. They wanted to charge us 35 Australian dollars each - that's about 24 English pounds - for something that was pedestrian, mundane and in parts totally offputting. The fruit salad was tinned; the hot buffet wasn't hot; our replenishment cups of coffee didn't come automatically. We actually had the cost of breakfast taken off our bill, because it just wasn't worthy anywhere near 35 dollars. You could do much better than the Swissotel. The Swissotel itself could do much better. It has no personality, no style, no pzzazz. It's all right if you're Swiss, I suppose.

To me, it was grey, crowded and just plain frenetic. My accommodation experiences were underwhelming too. However, this time was different. The entrance to the hotel is a little off-putting, stuck in the middle of a Myer store, but once up to the lobby on the 8th floor, the situation changes. Let me say from the outset that the hotel's largest asset is, undoubtedly, its staff. They were, unfailingly, pleasant, considerate, courteous and gave the impression that they were there only to help you enjoy your stay. I like that; it reflects very well on management. I hope they continue to see this as a priority. The hotel may not have all the whiz-bang bling of some, but it was well maintained and scrupulously clean. My room on the 21st floor (non-smoking, thankfully) was more than large enough for my needs, with a good quality bed, flatscreen TV, desk, a couple of chairs, a pod coffee maker (yes!) and a large, clean bathroom with bath and separate shower. Water pressure was good and it was hot. If I have a niggle it's this; c'mon guys, a few more channels on the TV wouldn't hurt, surely ... not everyone likes Fox Sport ... In-room internet access is available ... at a price. I'm not a fan of paying, but it is pretty standard in Australia, I know. The location is great, right in the CBD. Darling Harbour (what a great job they've done of that!) is just an easy 10-minute walk or, if you're particularly lazy, there's a monorail station even closer than that -- $9.95 for a day pass from memory. All the shopping areas/stores are also within easy walking distance, if that's your particular bent. Food in the hotel was good without being spectacular; it was fairly standard fare at fairly standard prices. Full buffet breakfast was $35; the wagyu burger in the bar area was very good. Drinks are standard prices; that is, by overseas standards they are expensive ... welcome to Australia. However, there is a Coles Liquorland just a couple of blocks away if you prefer a quiet drink in your room. I have to make particular mention of the dining room staff ... they all deserve a pay rise just for being so pleasant and accommodating.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA great location and weekend!\u201d", "Author": "jesad87", "ReviewID": "UR118256785", "Content": "Great location and amazing service but for the money the rooms were not the best - terrible spring beds and a poor quality tv.

This is a very good hotel option in central Sydney. The strong positives are: the rooms are typically a good size with large bathrooms; I have always found the staff at reception and the concierge service to be extremely friendly and helpful; the hotel is well maintained and in clean line tasteful decor throughout; the cocktail bar area is well appointed and pleasant and a good place to rendezvous with people; the hotel will match best available rates for the hotel offerred by other providers (ie you can deal with the hotel direct); WiFi is now free .... Well Done on this last point Swissotel I find the charging for internet in most hotels in Sydney inappropriate and increasingly out of step with hotels overseas. The hotel really is in a great central city location - easy walking distance to Darling Harbour, Chinatown, Hyde Park and the Museums and Galleries at that end of town and not an unpleasant walk down to Circular Quay. The location is bang in the middle of Sydney shopping and on the doorstep of the QVB. Despite the central city location every room I have ever stayed in has been quiet - not true of many other hotels I have used in the CBD area My points of caution are for car travellers. There is no drive way off the road if driving yourself which means you have to find on-street parking outside of the hotel on busy Market Street and the hotel entrance can be hard to spot. Tip: Get in the hard right lane on Market Street and pull into the first free spot you find along the kerb as you pass the Pitt Street Mall then walk to the entrance - the concierge will deal with the car parking from there. The other observation for car travellers is the cost of overnight car-parking. At $55 per night this is a bit more than I usually get charged at other Sydney hotels - be aware of that extra cost. I will continue to use Swissotel as a very good hotel option.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cTerrific Service and large rooms!\u201d", "Author": "lukmi", "ReviewID": "UR117971862", "Content": "I don't know whether I was plain lucky or what but I got one large room and bathroom this time around.

Word of Warning: If you are a Sydney sider and are driving to the hotel....the parking can be a nightmare! You need to battle the one way traffic of Market Street and pretty much just pull up where you can. The hotel does provide enough standing zone space for three cars maximum however, these spaces are usually taken up by Taxi's, loading vehicles, motorbikes, mopeds or scooters, so if you are lucky enough to snare a spot, grab it or risk pulling up and getting out for a valet to take your car. Note; if you miss the hotel it is a big trip back around two blocks to get back to the hotel...in Sydney traffic! The check in process was smooth and easy with impeccable friendly staff at valet, concierge and reception and our room was ready. Our room was impeccable.

There is already a small hairdryer provided which is plugged into a concealed vanity, so you cant unplug it to use the power point for any other appliance such a a hair straightener. I had to use the power point at the office desk, to which the hall mirror was too far away so I didn't have a mirror to use...as we were going out int h evening, this was quite annoying and frustrating. Prior to our show, we decided to go into the Executive Club Lounge for some pre-dinner drinks and canapes. There was only one staff member on who was friendly and pleasant upon our arrival and mentioned to us in conversation that \"itwas a quiet night there that night\". Unfortunately, quiet or not, the service offered in the Executive Club that evening was very, very poor and really unacceptable for the price paid for the suite and extra's. Bottle's of spirits ran out and were not replaced. I had glasses piled up on my table with plates and cutlery that sat there while the staff member on duty just walked around and talked to people an d at one stage was not even on the floor for a good 20 minutes or so. The ice ran out and was not replaced and the wine and small glasses also ran out and were not replaced. I was really very dissapointed in the way the Executive Lounge was attended to that evening. It is such a shame as the rest of our stay was wonderful, with great service in all other area's of the hotel. Finally on my return home, the Swissotel emailed me with a review of which I gave my honest opinion and now a month after completing that review, I have not had any response to it by the hotel. Why bother emailing out a review if you cant be bothered responding to the comments and constructive critisisim given ? With so many other choices in Sydney I am not sure if I will return...", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London/Auckland", "Title": "\u201cOk\u201d", "Author": "thepolarbeer", "ReviewID": "UR115448330", "Content": "Held high hopes on booking swissotel but it was a reasonably forgettable stay in hindsight.

Despite fewer TV channels than other properties the technology is modern and in top condition. The Nespresso machines are a small addition to the rooms that most 5-star hotels don't even offer. Views from most rooms are uniquely stunning but what can't be overlooked is Sydney's most convenient location that make it a delight regardless of whether you are a first-timer to Sydney or a seasoned traveller. The bathrooms are spacious to the point you almost question why extra space wasn't proportioned to the bedroom?

Town Hall subway is just one block away which connects you to local and commuter trains. We stayed for 6 nights and were told the standard rooms were fully booked, so we shelled out $30/night more for the next higher category which on the website appeared to have a couch/sitting area. But, when we checked into our room it looked like the standard room! I complained to the reception who said they would look into it but failed to call back after 15 minutes, so I went down in person to follow up. After which, the assistant manager advised the website pictures were wrong (which I hardly believe for such an established hotel chain) but she did offer to upgrade us to a suite for no additional charge! That saved an otherwise unfortunate start to our holiday. However, the suite was right next to the elevator and we could hear a constant buzzing/rattling whenever we were in the bathroom which was just on the other side of the elevator bank. The hotel amenities are somewhat standard and I was disappointed that you had to buy a separate password for each computer/Iphone you wanted to connect to the internet (either via LAN or wifi). I was there with my wife and we both had a laptop plus Iphone, so it would be good if they allowed you to share passwords provided only one login at a time like in other hotels I've stayed in, but I guess they're catering to business travelers who may only have one laptop or would be willing to pay for multiple passwords.

CONS: - Room safe too small for a laptop. - The room was large enough but missed certain essentials for a luxury hotel, such as chair/ottoman or coffee table. Net curtain behind the blinds also missing, meaning to avoid construction workers across the street looking in, we had to put down the blinds completely and the room was dark. Usually there is some kind of curtain which allows light to come in but blocks views from outside. Strangely enough, our friends who stayed in the same room category on the same floor had a larger room which did include these furnishings. - Housekeeping only available until 3 or 4pm (We were there for Mardi Gras festivities, so sleeping in was a priority). Other 4-5 star hotels in Sydney and elsewhere provide housekeeping & turndown service until 9pm. - Pool and spa area small and minimalistic. You have to turn on the sauna & steam room 30-45 minutes ahead of time yourself, and even then the Sauna did not heat up properly. No aromas, no flasks of water or ice tea, no music or bar at the pool, no toiletries in the changing rooms. Disappointing for a 5-star hotel (though it is not officially ranked 5 stars, but declares itself so). - No robes or slippers in room. - No iPod connection or radio in room. There are supposedly 2 radio stations accessible through the small TV, but those did not work (on the first day the technician said it would be fixed after the weekend, but we stayed a whole week and nothing happened). -Self-laundry room available, but $18 for one load of washing is ridiculous! -No free wifi even for Club Swiss Gold members.

So I arrived at the hotel 1 hour later only to find they did not have my booking and the guy behind the desk (Woody) was bordering on rude. He made some comment about well if you book through third party websites, this is what you can expect, so I explained to him that I had called the hotel direct and then he said well our central reservations is in Canada, so at this stage I was wondering how this was my fault and why I had to be informed of this so abruptly. So out the back he goes for the 2nd time, then he comes back in and starts pushing a few buttons on the keyboard to tell me that they have no rooms ready only a room with twin beds, I said not I would prefer a room with a king bed, that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what I had booked.

Firstly, I phoned in advance of my booking to confirm there will be a cot in my room as requested through wotif. I was told I had made no such request (when I had written evidence that I had) . The phone operator whilst being very nice was the FASTEST talker I have ever heard and was obviously in a rush, and combined with his accent - I could not understand a single word of what he was saying because he really was so fast. When I asked if he could slow down a little, he didn't. In the end he had to call me back to confirm my cot- which he ultimately did and when I arrived the cot was in the room. I also sent my wotif confirmation to the hotel showing absolutely that I had asked for a cot in the first instance. But it was only the day after I arrived that I got a response from someone else. She apologised and informed me that on my SECOND night I would get a cot. Obviously people were thoroughly confused when this cot then arrived and I said I actually already had a cot and the problem had been sorted on day 1. Obviously staff are not communicating with each other or checking the computer system. Then late at night on day 1 I ordered room service. I asked what the soup of the day was and then I had to be phoned back regarding that request as the staff member had no idea. When he did phone back I ordered the mushroom soup (not very nice) and when delivered the soup had no accompanying roll as promised, and came with a knife and fork but no spoon!!!! I think Swissotel Sydney has the world's hardest beds (I had a twin room, so maybe the Kings are better) with a doona and no sheet and felt hot all night. In the morning I asked if I could have a blanket and sheet. I got the blanket, but no sheet (asked again, along with face washers which were not provided when the room was serviced). Instant coffee and tea was also not replenished on day two of my stay and so I just went without for the rest of my time as I was sick of asking for stuff. Then a friend visited and got the third degree when she gave both my married name and my maiden (professional) name. They apparently could not understand why she would be saying two names and treated her as suspect. After she called up and I confirmed I knew her, the staff member then idly watched her walk all the way over to the lift by herself without the necessary access card and then watched her walk all the way back and he was still standing there - and just said 'yeah you need a card'. Finally breakfast on day three arrived, and once again the salt and pepper shakers were empty, like I found them on day 1. Same salt and pepper shakers or are they all like that and always like that and why is it that no-one ever bothers checking these things? The concierge I found to be really good and all the staff members (other than my friend's encounter) seemed nice and friendly, but there is point where you kind of want them to get their act together and stop making mistakes. The rooms are also starting to look a little dated and methinks an upgrade is in order sooner than later. The location is really handy to the shopping precinct of Sydney. Not a pretty spot, but a very handy spot.

We like the hotel's location in the heart of the retail precinct. It's possible to be in DJs, Myer, the new Centrepoint Westfield or the QVB within a minute or two of leaving the hotel. Unfortunately on check-in the computer systen was down & the manual check-in resulted in us being booked into a room on the 15th floor which was also allocated to someone else. Staff came & fetched us to rectify the problem, reallocating us to the 12th floor. Straight away our room key didn't work, so it was back down to reception again. We were told that it was probably the battery in the lock & that a technician woukd be called. We were issued with new keys. A technician never arrived, & everytime we left the hotel we couldn't get into our room on our return. As there was someone different on the desk each time they would just issue us with new keys, or come up & let us in. This was very frustrating & should have been better addressed. Another small complaint is that we asked the concierge about 5.30pm where we could purchase some wine & we were directed to a bottle shop about a 5min walk away in Park St where we had a choice of only 2 very cheap & ordinary wines. We had to find out for ourselves that the DJs food hall is open till 7pm & that it provides an extensive product range of the type required.

We bought recent Bon Jovi Concert tickets and decided to make a weekend of it.

We decided to whoop it up 5 star and booked this as a Last Minute Mystery Hotel, as they were about the only rooms left. When we got the location details, we were stoked. I knew straight away we were where we wanted to be. Right on top of Pitt St Mall, Adjacent to Centre Point Tower and Queen Victoria Buildings. Town Hall Train Station is 5 mins away. Buses and Taxis run left, right and centre. It really is convenient to everywhere. The monorail is across the street at The Hilton, which provides easy access to Darling Harbour and the Casino. We drove down to Sydney and used the Valet Parking Service, but never touched the car. It was much easier to cab, train or bus. We ate both nights in the JBP Restaurant and the food was exquisite and reasonably priced. The Breakfast Buffet just had too many things to choose from, and all fresh. Maitre D Ronnie did everything and more to accommodate us very early the first night and 10pm the second. Waitress Ana (I think) stayed back and happily chatted and served us even though everyone else was gone. One minor complaint was the bar shut at midnight on Sat night, with at least 20 people still drinking and happy to be there. This could be a licensing thing, but it was such a good place to sit, chat and relax, we could have stayed another hour or three. As all the good pubs an clubs have entry lines by that time of night, we pulled the pin and just went to bed. Our room was on the 12th floor and we heard nothing. The Hotel only starts on Level 8, as The Myer Department Store occupies the first 7 levels. The room was beautifully appointed and very spacious. Everything about the bathrooms were first class. We had a corner room looking up Market St toward Hyde Park. It was Xmas shopping mayhem, but you wouldn't know it in the rooms. It was silent. The room faced East, but blockout curtains allowed us to sleep in late. We didn't use the gym, but we went to use the pool and spa. It was a cool day and the pool was barely chilled, certainly not \"heated.\" The spa was about the temperature I'd expect the pool, and certainly not hot enough to be a spa. This was only a minor thing as we did so much over the two days, we had little time to swim. On an extended stay, I would've liked to have used it.

Outstanding staff. Okay room...just a bit too noisy.\u201d", "Author": "AshleeSydney", "ReviewID": "UR91077829", "Content": "My partner and I stayed at Swwishotel in Sydney in late December 2010 for just 2 nights. We stayed in an executive room - which essentially meant that we had access to the executive club lounge for breakfast and evening canapes and drinks. First the good: Swisshotel in Sydney is located right above Pitt Street Mall (Sydney City's main shopping destination) - it doesn't get much more central than this - particularly if you love shopping...even window shopping! There are restaurants, cafes and entertainment right at your doorstep. Other points of interest such as Circular Quay and Darling Harbour are a mere 10-15 minutes' walk away. And when you get tired of all the shopping and eating and people, just jump into the Swisshotel's lift and be whisked 8 storeys above the sity, into the hotel's main lobby for some peace and quiet and maybe a drink at the lobby bar. Check in is smooth and easy. The staff are gracious and very responsive to guests' needs. We were very happy to be given a room on level 24 - its fun to be high up and on the same level as the executive lounge. It was room 2401. Now may I give advice: if they put you in room 2401, ask for a different room. This is the not-so-good. The room was smaller than I expected - mainly because the hotel had referred to its executive rooms as very spacious - this room did not feel so spacious - it was a normal sized hotel room. No big deal. On the other hand, the bathroom was very spacious and the shower was fantastic. I could have stayed in there all day! BUT the problem was not that the room was not as spacious as expected - the problem was that the room was located right next to the hotel's service lifts, which were neatly concealed behind a door that said 'Private'. The consequence of this was that we heard staff going up and down the lifts, in and out the private door, with their service trolleys and whetever else, till very late at night and then starting again very early in the morning. Now the staff were merely going about their business and not trying to disturb us at all, but each time I was woken by the private door openning or shutting, I felt pretty unhappy. After one night of this, I contemplated requesting a different room. But the fact was that we were only staying 2 nights so I guess it didn't bother me enough to change rooms for one more night - but it did bother me enough to leave me feeling irritable. And that's sad, because otherwise the hotel was pretty good. And as I said before, the staff were excellent. Night 2 was much the same with respect to the lifts and staff movements, but this time we knew to expect it and didn't feel quite as put out as the first night. Now, moving back to the good: The executive lounge is an oasis. The staff are outstanding. A lady called Iche hosted breakfast in the lounge. Iche was so kind and helpful and ready to offer service - she is an outstanding example of good hospitality management. In the evenings, we had Stewart as our host. He too was outstanding - taking time to speak with all guests, making sure that everything was taken care of well and also knowing when people wanted to be left alone. We were very impressed. Overall, Swisshotel is good and its personnel are its finest feature. Make sure to ask for a quiet room - away from all lifts - guest lifts and service lifts - and pay a little bit extra to get access to the executive lounge - its worth it.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cA hotel in the centre of everything\u201d", "Author": "levi2225", "ReviewID": "UR89873925", "Content": "We were visiting Sydney to attend a show and catch up with old friends, so we needed a hotel that was in the middle of everything and to sleep in relative peace and comfort.

The staff whilst friendly enough are not anywhere near a 5 star standard and need serious retraining on how to deal with guests. The rate I pre-paid through a wholesaler included breakfast daily, yet every single day for my 5 night stay I went down for breakfast, I was told by the restaurant that breakfast wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t included and it would be an additional cost; this was despite bringing it to the receptions attention on day 2 and being promised it was fixed (it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t!)

But they don't have a 5 star feel about them because they are not luxurious enough. The main lobby too, while nice is also not to a 5 star level. I know that the hotel is limited by the architecture of the building, but arriving on the ground floor is rather unwelcoming as you have to navigate your way around hoardes of people and luggage. There wasn't any room for my taxi on arrival, so he had to double park about 20 m from the hotel and we both made a quick dash to the sidewalk with my luggage before potentially getting run over by another car. I was on the executive floor and I rate that as quite average. The staff in the executive lounge are excellent and extremely friendly, but the amenities were poor. Most executive lounges that I have been to around the world usually have at least chips, cookies or nuts outside of the breakfast and cocktail hours, but there was nothing but fridge drinks (which were also rather limited) and the Nespresso machine. The breakfast was also very average with limited choice (was kind of gluggy and cold anyway). The JPB restaurant was okay (not fabulous but good enough). Food was pretty good but service was a little slow and unattentive. Would I stay here again? Yes, but not a any price and certainly not at regular rack rate. It's okay at the $220-$275 range, I would not pay more than that.

Night three of a three night stay. The hotel has a great location, very central to all shopping, business and Hyde Park. There is no driveway to enter the hotel on Market Street and only a small loading zone usually taken by cabs. We arrived by car and were given a choice of valet parking ($55.00 a night) or self park (two blocks away for $25.) The door men were ok, but not real welcoming. The lobby is on th 8th floor, accessible by elevator. Attractive high ceiling lobby with a bar as the main feature opposite the front desk. . At the front desk we were politely greeted. We managed to get upgraded to a club swiss executive room on the 23rd floor, but only after mentioning that we were Club Swiss members and asking for an upgrade. Our room has a city vie on the 23rd floor. Large bright room. Large bathroom with tub and separate shower. Lots of ammenities provided. King size bed, low (euro style),firm. Very small flat screen TV. Lots of close space with illumination. Not enough electrical outlets for 21st century electronics and gadgets. Lots of room, decent furniture, blackout blinds, good lighting. No free internet. On the 24th floor there is the Club Swiss Gold lounge available for frequent guests who qualify. Includes breakfast, free wireless, coffee tea, canapes and drinks in the late afternoon. I am fortunate to be staying directly above the lounge. My laptop has picked up the free wireless signal. The Spa, outdoor pool and gym are on the 10th floor. Smaller pool,lots of deck chairs with direct sun. Well equipped modern gym. The Spa has the usual available treatments, sauna and steam. Towels and lockers are provided. Towels only available at the spa reception desk. Make sure to take two or three. Small towels. The Men's steam is fibreglass lined, too much illumination and it stinks. The sauna heated up quickly and was the better choice. The keys provided for the locker were attached to a laminated card. Would be more convenient for spa users if it were on an elastized bracelet. The hotel has business centre. Very basic, no fax machine, no attendant. Room service was very good, and delivered to the room promptly. We have asked for a late checkout and were most graciously accomodated. This hotel is not a Fairmont, in service.

The central bar (Crossroads) is relaxing and comfortable; the food menu is quite limited. We shared a Margherita pizza which was very tasty and a generous portion, and some beer-battered potatoes which weren't very nice (a little overdone so the batter formed a hard shell, and a heavy oily flavor as if the oil needed changing; the big bowl of potatoes came with a minted yogurt dip which was overpowered by the potatoes; this dish really needs a rework). The cocktail menu is really creative and had some lovely choices, but like most cocktails in Sydney (especially hotels and other tourist areas) there are no bargains. Service in the lounge was on par with other Sydney lounges (which means a little lackadaisical-- that's just how they do it in Sydney--- you're not in America any more so don't expect American service standards).

There aren't too many other top hotels that really put you in the heart of the City but this was great; the buzz of Sydney is right on your doorstep. As for the hotel, it really is very nice. We had one of the corner suites, which was beautiful! Huge room with a gorgeous bathroom and even a balcony. I didn't even know you could have balconies in hotels up this high but that was a great surprise! We could even see Darling Harbour from the balcony :D. I have read a few other reviews on here saying rooms were too small or what not... I'm not sure what the standard rooms are like but I can tell you the corner suite was fantastic; large room, beautiful big bathroom, great comfy bed and the balcony too :D I would definitely recommend getting this one. We had a great stay and were very happy with the service. Everyone was very nice, we also got room service for dinner one night too and the food was very great.

At first we were a little concerned reading some of the reviews, but we needn't have been as the whole experience was fantastic from checkin to leaving. Staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful allowing us to check in when we arrived on an early morning flight (We had only expected to be able to leave our bags) We were upgraded to a room with great views over St Mary's Cathedral which was lit up for the festival at the time. Sydney was beautiful, and the Swissotel was the perfect location to see if from. Minutes from the train station to airport and elsewhere, to Darling Harbour and the ferries, to the Monorail and of course right in the heart of town next to Sydney Tower and the beautiful Queen Vic Building. One day pass allows you to travel on any bus, train or ferry all over Sydney, and even gets you to or from the airport, although you need to also pay an extra levy for the airport station.

Sometimes it's terrific, but often it's not. Onthe good side, I really like the fact that the check-in staff are so professional and recognise you with a friendly greeting. They are good. The beds are very comfortable and beautifully laundered, a real pleasure at the end of a long day. The rooms, whilst a little plain, are spotlessly clean and well maintained, consistently so: very Swiss! But oh dear, the room service food can sometimes be ordinary (and expensive). Think $45 for lamb, $10 for a fairly ordinary glass of wine and, to make matters worse, $5 for delivery (isn't that what room service is). It sometimes arrives cool and is a bit ordinary--for the price. The breakfast in the dining room on level 8 is the real problem. Not only do you frequently have to wait a really long time to be seated, but the coffee is truly horrid (I normally have tea as a result). The hot food is OK but hardly 5 star fare. What I REALLY object to though is that the eggs are cooked using battery cage eggs; I know this because on the bench near where the omelettes are cooked, there are cartons of cheap eggs marked \"cage eggs\". Hardly desirable for both animal welfare and human health purposes. I was shicked whenI recently saw this and walked away. The chicken sausages are dire--hard as rocks and full of emulsifed fats. In summary, the Swissotel in Sydney is a goodish hotel but probably you could expect more for 5 star. Certainly, I'd go elsewhere for food. If you can get a special, well and good; but if not, I'd be inclined to go to the Hilton or Westin if for around the same money.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide", "Title": "\u201cFantasic spot, great breakfast!\u201d", "Author": "AdelaideMermaid", "ReviewID": "UR68261888", "Content": "My husband and I stayed one night at Swissotel Sydney after much searching on the internet for a reasonably priced one night stay. I wanted to stay 5 star, as we had only one night together before meeting up with family, and thought it might be something a little special. I wanted to spend not much more than $200 though, which seemed like a push in central Sydney. I ended up taking a room at Swissotel Sydney with Wotif.com.au for a special \"breakfast included deal\" in an \"upgraded room\" for $240, which I thought was a great price so grabbed it. The hotel itself is a surprise, with the entrance right next to Myers (between the two doors actually) and a small 'greeting' area just inside the main door, before being directed to a set of lifts to take you to the 8th floor where reception was located. The reception area was roomy and the conference/cocktail lounge area was right next to the check-in, so we had to dodge around very well-dressed business people with glasses of champagne and beer in hand. The reception staff were professional and I do remember a smile. We checked in earlier than anticipated, at around 1130, which wasn't a problem. We then proceeded to the 21st floor via another set of elevators. Our room was pleasant enough, although very small. Infact with our suitcases on the floor there wasn't much room left to walk around the bed. There was an unnessasarily large wardrobe with lots of drawers (which always puzzles me in hotels, as I've never once unpacked fully). Anyhow, our suitcases were too wide for the wardrobe, so we had no option other than to leave them out on the floor. I did ring reception to enquire if we were actually in the 'upgraded room' and she advised us that we were. There was nothing special about it, that's for sure. Except perhaps for the $1000 coffee machine that was located on the office desk. It certainly didn't add anything to the room, and if that constitutes an upgrade on the basis of the coffee machine, then it's really not worth it. It did. However, provide us with lots of laughs watching my husband try and get the thing going, by just looking at the diagrams imprinted on the plastic. Nothing, it seems, is easy! Incidentally, Wotif really hammed it up about the coffee machine, and I was expecting much more, don't know what really, but didn't expect the machine to be shoved on the desk almost as an afterthought. The bathroom was almost as big as the bedroom and was nice and bright with black and white checked tiles. Nothing to complain about here, except of course as with most older hotels there is no exhaust fan, which really annoys me! The room is so steamed up that it's unusable for the next person, and it's nice to have a fan in the room I think if there is more than one person using to toilet each morning, if you know what I mean. We couldn't open the roman blind to the window in the bathroom, as I quickly found out, or the people on the 21st floor of the office block directly outside the window would have had a right laugh. I loved that the hotel was right next door to Myers (my husband might not agree) and it was a treat just \"popping next door for a sec\" to find yourself in the middle of a mid-year sale! The best bit of the stay was the buffet breakfast by far. It was certainly the most extensive buffet breakfast I've had, and there has been a few. The restaurant decor was gorgeous, and the chairs were very comfy which was nice first thing in the morning. There was a lot of activity but didn't seem crowded. They had a few nice touches, like the real honey comb dripping honey on to a serving tray. We didn't use room service or the restaurant for a main meal, so can't comment. Except to say the room service menu was extremely pricey, something like $25 for a toasted sandwich (by memory, apologies if that's incorrect, but it was a laughable amount). The hotel is within easy walking distance to Darling Harbour and we went there for lunch and dinner and to visit the quarium. Overall there wasn't anything not to like, but the room was a tad disappointing and I now wish I had paid the extra $50 and stayed at the Marriott Sydney Harbour which was the other hotel I was tossing up. There they had rooms with a view of the opera house or bridge, and after looking out at a few office blocks from our room at the Swissotel, would have been a real treat for not that much extra.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australia", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay with just one minor hitch\u201d", "Author": "Kavya", "ReviewID": "UR68126124", "Content": "I loved staying at the Swissotel Sydney.

The Restaurant nor the staff were busy? I had to request teabags on two seperate ocassions on the first visit. Also the fruit juice stand wasnt stocked that well two had runout. The breakfast display in my opinion was poor. There wasnt much choice in cooked meats or cheeses. The bread/rolls were basic and some felt it had been on display too long. The fruit was ok but there was no yogurt? There was a fresh honeycomb rack which looked interesting. The 'cooked' breakfast I have to say in all the countries in the world I ve been this has to be the worst ever. Everything was stone cold both mornings and we visited at different times. A hotel with 4 stars and they cant even heat baked beans.......The bacon sausage mushrooms tomatoes and various potatoes looked great but all stone cold.

In the restaurant we found staff to be falling over themselves wanting to assist us, however of the 3 times we needed to speak to reception, twice we found that getting assistance was quite a struggle, and one of the women we dealt with was almost rude.

However, check-in was a disgrace. We waited at least 15 mins before we were invited to the reception desk - even though there was only one person in front of us. Then the girl who checked us in was unfriendly and unhelpful. I think it is great that Swissotel employs multiculturally but it is an issue when the person checking you in can not speak english properly and therefore you cant understand what they are saying - this is appalling considering this is an english speaking country! I asked if breakfast was included in the cost of the room and she made me feel like I was trying to rob them as she said to me if I could prove that this is what it said she would be happy to oblige - I was simply enquiring so I could plan where we would go the following morning! We got our keys and got into the lift but found the key to be very temperamental and would only work after a few tries on both the lifts and the room door. The room was nice but outdated and not what you would expect in a 5 star hotel. The tv was also difficult to turn on and would have to be pressed for about a minute before it decided to turn on. The room looked over a building sight but this couldnt be helped. We went to use the hotel pool and went searching for some towels, only to be told rudely that there werent any left. We had to go back to our room and get our bath towels then ring housekeeping to bring us some more - why couldnt the girl who was working in the spa (next to the pool) have called housekeeping to let them know??? Again, not something that would happen in some of the other 5 star hotels. Finally, on check out, after we were barely greeted by staff, we came across another blunder! The girl asked for the credit card so she could charge parking to it. We were told on check in that it would be charged immediately. Also, without our knowledge $100 was held on our card for parking. Once again the girl could hardly speak english so I was having trouble understanding what she was saying and the more I tried to understand the more frustrated she got! She then told me that it was only visible to us on our card because we had a debit credit card rather than a normal credit card. Again, this was never explained to us on check-in! I have stayed in a lot of hotels where self-parking is involved and I have never had money held because of it. She then proceeded to say that the $100 would take 7-9 working days to be put back in the account. When I asked why none of this had been explained she timidly apologised and sent us on our way.

The workout room, pool and saunas are on the 10th floor and while none of them are very large they are bigger than several other properties I visited in Australia and clean so I used them daily. I did not visit the restauarant. Across the street is the Queen Victoria Building which is loaded with excellent cafes and coffee shops providing both delectable breakfast (at a fraction of the cost) in a breathtakingly beautiful building. We also opted to have our dinners in neighborhoods outside the CBD - something I would encourage all travelers do. The lobby is bustling and quite pretty (located on the 8th floor). I found the concierge staff which are located on the ground level at the entrance to be very eager to help and extremely courteous but not as knowledgeable as other properties. However, I do give them credit for trying which I always appreciate. Overall, I would consider staying here again even though there are other properties in Sydney I also liked and would consider visiting again as well.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cNot Sure\u201d", "Author": "Cavanboy", "ReviewID": "UR50577467", "Content": "I stayed at this Hotel for 6 nights, and not sure if I would return again if in Sydney.

We have stayed in 'Swiss Advantage Room' or 'Swiss Executive Club room', depending on the deal that is available. On this occasion, we stayed in their Advantage room (Room Number 2511). Which is located on the top floor. I am not sure about their standard room (known as Classic room) but Advantage rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed. We arrived late in the evening and the hotel was pretty full, as we found out later. After we checked-in, we just dropped off our bags and went to get a bite to eat. When we returned to the room, we went straight to bed. We could hear construction noise from the ground level. We tried to ignore it and sleep but it was still causing us grief. We could hear the truck's reversing beeps to bulldozer smashing and dragging concrete - this is happening at midnight!! After 1:00am, I went down and spoke with the receptionist. He called the night manager (James). He was surprised to hear that construction was still going on at that time of the night but informed me the hotel is full. After fair bit of searching on the room allocation computer (initially could only find a standard room), we got a replacement room on another side of the building (one bedroom suite Room 2220). As hotel was full and comparable room to the one we booked was difficult to locate, it did take over 40 minutes to get the replacement room but James did come through for us\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 admittedly with some assertive requests. I was told that construction does end earlier in the evening (normally) but be advised, as good as this hotel is, half the hotel rooms face the construction side. If you are a light sleeper or have good hearing, you might want to request the quiet side of the building. As a final note, a concierge on the ground floor recognised us from our previous stay and welcomed us with a big smile and came up to us and said hello. I am not sure if day-time reception staff work long hours and were tired but smiles cost nothing.

Upon arriving, we were provided with a king room, which obviously doesn't work well with three adults. The person bringing our luggage to the room was great and offered to immediately help us change rooms. The second room was a room with two double beds. As other guests have indicated, their furnishings are showing wear and tear. The room was on the small side, however this was not that big of a deal, except it looked so much different than the pictures. The carpet was somewhat dirty. The first kind of mishap happened when we asked about the \"shaving\" outlet in the bathroom and were told that the outlet in the bathroom could be used for other devices. This ended up frying my curling iron which had to be replaced (at our cost) for $100. The next incident happened when we asked for a wake up call, and set the alarm in the room. Neither the wake up call happened or the alarm worked the next morning (when we had a tour scheduled that left at 8:00am). We called and asked about the wake-up call and they apologized and gave an excuse for why it happened. Three times total, they didn't call for the wake up call when we called and asked the night before. Each time they apologized and provided an excuse. The phone in the room also didn't work. We contacted maintenance and they came to the room and said that the problem was with the phone in the bathroom, but they wouldn't be able to fix it. This caused our phone to work sporadically, which was quite frustrating. The television signal in the room was fuzzy and made it to where you could barely see what was on the television at the time. They said that there was a problem with their satellite. We were quite surprised that for such a nice hotel (rated 4 stars) that their television would be so small and is located on the top of a dresser which makes it quite low. Again, this is not the way that it was pictured in their hotel pictures. The staff in the executive lounge area were not overly friendly or helpful. We asked about restaurant suggestions and they gave us a vague suggestion to go to Darling Harbour. We could have figured that out. They sometimes acted as if we were bothering them when we had questions. There were two staff members who throughout the day would be sitting in the reception area chatting and when asked questions again, they acted as if they were being inconvenienced. The breakfast was good. The first day we were there, the bread for the toast had mold all on it. They did replace it and apologized. The bircher museli was excellent. The coffee machine in the executive lounge never worked. Overall, the experience in the hotel was not what we expected. We tried to speak with the manager at the front desk and when we told them about the issues we had, he acted as if we were just being a pain. We have stayed at other Swissotels throughout the world and have had great experiences. This was not one of them. I don't think that the hotel quality is worth the amount of money paid--especially given the extra we paid for the executive level (although as mentioned above, we did enjoy the breakfast).

Good location, around a 20 minutes walk to Circular Quay and less than 10 minutes to Darling Harbour. The hotel is also located within seconds of the Myers Department store and just around the corner from Queen Victoria Building that houses a number of shops. The hotel in itself was comfortable but felt it lacked a personal feel. The rooms were spacious and the kings size bed in the Classic Room was certainly more than King Size and in need ensured a good nights rest. A positive was the free late check out although this did not go to plan as detailed below. The Swimming pool should have been heated but it was too cold to swim in and the Jacuzzi was not the best I've ever been in. My gripe with this hotel compared to other 5 star hotels was the level of service 1. We arrived and despite having secured a deal for breakfast and club executive longue access, the receptionist initially insisted that we had room only! Having queried this and showed her the reservation document, she still insisted it was room only. It took me a while to explain what the reservation document said and eventually she made a call to clarify the situation. After 3-4 minutes the situation was resolved- They say first impressions go along way! 2. The club executive longue was ok, good evening service but it still lacked a 5 star feel with the staff being very stand off. Breakfast was not as good as that served downstairs in the main restaurant with limited choice and no offer of additional food being served up. For example omelettes were served in the main restaurant but no service was offered to provide this in the Executive Longue. In other club executive longue I've been in, staff have been very attentive but not in this one. We were rarely asked our room number except for one woman who scared the hell out of us when she demanded your room number- Attendance at a customer relations course is my next suggestion! 3. On the Saturday morning we decided to eat Breakfast in the main restaurant only to find a Queue of over 30 people waited to be seated. Having waited in a non-moving Queue for a couple of minutes we exited and had breakfast in the longue upstairs. 4. The reception staff struggled to communicate with their grasp of English not being the greatest. This is probably harsh on some of the staff, as the male staff seemed to have a better understanding than the females. 5. Having arranged late check out which despite getting it for free- I was more than willing to pay for it -we arrived back in our room to freshen up and finish packing only to find housekeeping in the middle of cleaning our room.

The bathroom is nice - but nice in a B&B, not for a supposedly 5 Star Hotel.

Lastly, it seems surprising in this day and age that the front desk would assume that two men traveling together would want separate beds. Gay couples travel too. Simply asking \"twins or king\" would be more appropriate than \"you'll want two twins, yes?\" Not a big deal, but I guess I expected better for a cosmopolitan hotel.

Although we were promised free parking for 2 days, we had to explain it several times to other concierges who weren't informed about it, and when checking out, we had the sum on our hotel bill.

I was very much looking forward to staying there this trip based on my last stay, but I liked the hotel better when it was newer because it seemed cleaner. My husband and I agreed that the chairs in the Crossroads bar in the lobby needed serious reupholstering. The dirty arms and obvious spilled food/drinks on the chairs actually made me feel grossed out to sit in them. I do still like the room.s Well, I actually think the bathrooms are the best part of the rooms for the full length tub and cool Swiss design. The spa has a very nice menu, but I decided I'd rather spend my money on new clothes than spa treatments. My husband and I agreed that our flatscreen TV was too small to actually watch from the distance of the bed. In summary, the Swissotel is a very nice place, but it just seems some details have been overlooked, and for the same price, I question if you could find a nicer, more updated place. That said, the Marriott near Hyde Park costs more per night, and my husband and his colleagues agree that Swissotel is a better value - a nicer place for less money. If you want to shop, then I would recommend Swissotel because it's by the QVB, Myer and David Jones. But if you want to sightsee, then I am very fit (work out daily) but quickly tired of the walk to the Circular Quay, and I preferred the Mantra, even if it wasn't as clean or stylish. As this was my 5th trip to Sydney, I was looking for some \"off the beaten path\" suggestions for restaurants and things to do from the concierge. I found the concierge completely useless, and that I could have done a better job myself! They are still recommending the same restaurants they told us about in 2007! And, on a Sunday night at 9 when we needed dinner, they told us about 1 restaurant, which we'd already eaten at and did not like. If we weren't willing to go there, they said nothing else in Sydney would be opened! Pardon me?! Even I could list a few places. My husband and I went for a walk and found a few choices of places that still had kitchens open. They best part of staying at Swissotel Sydney is the style / decor and closeness to shopping.

The staff seemed really nice, we didn't try out the restaurant or get room service, so can't comment on that. The location is really good - just around the corner from the monorail station and a block away from Town Hall train station. The only thing we can fault the hotel on is that the curtains don't block out the light, My husband is a really light sleeper and the first ray of light usually wakes him up.

Orbitz had a special deal on this place, and I found an additional online Orbitz \"Promotion Code\" via Google which took another 10% off my stay. Therefore, I paid only ~115 USD/night inclusive of all taxes and fees!!! Anyways, here is my experience: Room: I had the least expensive room; however, I was very satisfied. The room was very clean, spacious enough for 1-2 people, and had a nice desk for work. The TV is a ~26\" LCD display which has CNN, FOX, Cartoon Network, local programming, pay movies, etc. I liked the control which allows you to operate the air conditioning, room lights, and wake alarm right from the nightstand at the bed! Very thoughtful! Minor gripe: there is a construction site next door which has construction workers operating during business days from about 08:00 to 16:00. More important gripe: the bed is VERY firm. I prefer a softer bed, so this was a moderate gripe for me. Internet in Room: Big Disappointment. The charge is around 25 AUD/24 hours, and the connection is VERY slow (about 0.5 Mb/sec). I get faster speeds in the US on a cellular 3G connection! Exercise Facility: There is a small room on the 10th floor with cardio LifeFitness and a few other strength machines. There are two stationary bikes, two treadmills, and one eliptical. There are also two televisions in the exercise room. All of the equipment I tried worked well but none of the machines had cup/bottle holders for your water. Pool/Hot Tub: Adjacent to the exercise room there is a beautiful pool (lap swimming is possible), hot tub, and some lounge chairs for sun tanning. The pool and hot tub are heated quite well. Main restaurant: I had the 30 AUD buffet breakfast, and it was disappointing. I chose to eat breakfast here since the restaurant opened at 06:00 (excellent for a business traveler), but the food items were not fully setup until around 06:45. There is a cooking station for cook-to-order items like eggs, waffles, pancakes, etc, but the cook did not seem to want to cook me anything. The food quality was good, but the lack of being fully open at restaurant opening and attitude of the chef left me with a bad feeling about this place. Location: Excellent! For business travelers, you are right in the heart of the Sydney CBD. For touring, you are about a 10-15 minute walk from Circular Quay (ferries depart here to Taronga Zoo), and you are less than a five-minute walk to Hyde Park. INSIDER INFORMATION: Take the AirportLink train from the airport to St. James rail station to get to the hotel. The fare is 15.20 AUD each way (less on a return ticket), and the service is very good. Also, St. James station is less than a five-minute walk to the hotel (three blocks). A cab from the airport will cost you at least 45 AUD each way.", "Date": "June 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney", "Title": "\u201cWonderful with unexpected freebies\u201d", "Author": "Numbats", "ReviewID": "UR31344372", "Content": "We stayed at the Swissotel as a 40th birthday treat and opted for the Romance package.

The biggest problem was our experience at Crossroads Bar. We stopped in for a light dinner after a day of touring. I ordered a pina colada with a virgin colada for my daughter. The server gave my drink to my daughter. She had been drinking it before I took a sip I mine and realized she had my drink. Our waitress notified both the server and the bartender. The bartender asked if my daughter was okay, but the server was more concerned with trying to blame the bartender for the mix-up. They didn't even bother to comp the drinks. I notified the manager in the morning and she just said she'd put it in her report. Considering giving alcohol to an 8 year old is a legal offense and could have poisoned my daughter, I expected a formal apology from management at the least but did not get one. They did not show the appropriate level of concern for my daughter's safety.

The hotel is very handily placed for most of the main attractions in Sydney . Its within walking distance of Darling Harbour , Circular Quay , Opera House , Sydney Bridge , Sydney tower (next door ) ,Botanic gardens and the Rocks , even walking at the pace of a three year old . Its is very handily placed for the monorail and the tour buses that run up George Street . We booked a family room - kids themed room . This comprised of two double beds , one for the adults and one for my daughter which had kids duvet set , numerous cuddly toys , kids table and chairs . It also had a DVD player in the room with kids DVDs available for hire . It was the first time we had seen anything like this and made my daughter settle very quickly . Beds were comfortable and quiet , we were on 13th floor . The hotel has a smallish outdoor pool which is meant to be heated but it wasn't very warm when we where there in mid December , especially on the cloudier days . Breakfast is buffet style and there was a reasonable choice . Conceirge staff were very friendly and helpful . They could even recommend a kids buggy/ stroller hire , which was a godsend as in the early evenings our daughter got tired and is a bit heavy to carry so the stroller was great. ( Can be hired from Rocks Pharmacy , opposite Police Station) . Only downside , like most hotels these days , is that the internet access/ costs is complete rip-off compared with Internet cafes . We did a fair of site seeing , Taronga Zoo , Sydney tower , Opera House , Open top bus tours , Sydney Aquarium to name a few . I did the Bridgeclimb on the Sydney Bridge , its is fab and not to be missed , We did the beaches Bondi, Manly and Coogee beaches and played in the surf . Had great mojitos , though pricey in Argyle bar on Argyle Street and good food in Rocks cafe . Overall , i would say that the Swissotel is in a great location and I felt reasonably priced .

We had booked a flight+hotel package from a travel website and requested a \"swiss advantage\" room, which was supposed to be a room on a higher floor. The taxi dropped us outside the hotel, and immediately a bellboy came to help. The reception is on the 8th floor and we got our room keys promptly. The room was paid for but we were of course asked for a credit card for the extras. Our room was situated on the 23rd floor, executive floor, but we did not have access to the executive lounge.

After significant online research, I unfortunately selected the Swissotel. While the location is certainly very central there were plenty of other higher-end properties within a 5 block radius. Unlike most of the other properties, this hotel does not have any form of driveway, port cochere, etc. , so the taxi driver has no choice but to drop their passengers curbside. Rather, as close to curbside as possible - This is a VERY busy city street; the hotel is located directly opposite a major theatre and is technically within the physical building of a major department store. When I arrived, there were already cars double parked in front of the tiny hotel entry way, so I was let off in the middle of the street with no bellman in sight. After dragging my bags into the the street level micro-lobby, I was directed to the 8th floor for a proper check in. There was a huge line-up at checkin, but my room was actually ready. I had booked a junior suite and that is the room type I got. The room itself was respectable, clean, and generously proportioned. Unlike many other reviewers, I found the bed to be quite comfortable - it is rather firm, but of a good quality with above average bedding materials. The inclusion of an in-room Nespresso coffee machine was a very nice touch. The rest of the room was rather unspectacular. Think Sheraton Four Points - not at all bad, but not 5 star. The biggest failing of this hotel was the staff. They were all very young and inexperienced and it really showed. The front desk staff maintained a calm pleasant demeanor, but were unable to process all but the most simple of basic service requests. If you were not out of your room by 1pm forget about getting the room serviced - \"It is not possible\" was the reply from housekeeping. The lone bright spots in service were the executive lounge staff who were very competent, albeit not as personable and friendly as is the norm. The biggest standout surprise was the hotel security - this gentelman actually seemed to function as more of a manager than the duty managers did. He actually repsonded directly to guest concerns and after a few days, I noticed other guests actually seeking him out for resolution of their issues. I noticed that many of the positive reviews of this property were from those staying a short time (1 to 3 days) Perhaps that, combined with some rather attractive online pricing makes this more of an aspirational 5 star - entry level luxury if you will. The bottom line - if you get the hotel at a favorable rate and are looking for clean and close you'll probably be just fine.

The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to make my daughters feel welcome, which my wife and I thought was a nice touch. The room was comfortable and spotless. The kid's loved the heated pool on the 10th floor overlooking the CBD.

I have to say that I got a good rate and so I cannot complain too much but I really dont see where this is a 5-star hotel. The rooms we had were extremely small and pokey - in fact the one my friends in was so small they were practically climbing over furniture when they moved about it - and when I went to visit them it was downright claustrophobic. Things I particularly DID NOT like: - The bed ...OMG. It was possibly the hardest bed I have ever slept in with the exception of the dreadful places I have stayed in China and Taiwan. The bed was so hard that the only way I could get some modicum of sleep was to get all of the pillows in a line and lie on top of them. Interesting to note that my friends didnt have an issue with their bed so either they had a better one or I am just super fussy. I did leave my comments in the review card about the beds. I mean I just COULD NOT sleep. it was awful. - And then if not getting even a slight bit of sleep was bad ...I was further annoyed on Saturday morning by the sound of jackhammers and machinery as the guys worked on the nearby construction site. Yes, not exactly a problem of the hotel but extremely annoying when I was actually for once taking some much needed R&R but just didnt get it. - No power points in the bathroom. Not an issue except if, like me, you have a hair straightener...nowhere to plug it in. I had to stand outside the bathroom by the mini bar to do my hair - the worlds smallest bar fridge. It just had no depth and you couldnt fit anything in it. I guess the hotel wants you to use their drinks etc at their exhorbitant rates but if you want to put some of your own stuff in there then you just have to empty all of theirs out first and even then you are struggling to get anything in there - Having to use two sets of lifts to get up to the room. The first day I was in and out all day and it was so frustrating to have to go from street level to the 8th and then across the lobby and to the lifts to the room. Not a great deal you might think but annoying when you are getting tired from walking. - Using the key card for the lift. Yeah, I know security wise this is great but what annoyed me is that the swipe didnt always work first time and some slots worked better than others (and some worked not at all) Things I DID like: - the location - cant fault the location. Right near the Pitt Street Mall and close to the Monorail if you want to sight-see that way. Easy walking distance to Darling Harbour and Circular Key - there was a pillow menu but I didnt discover this until it was too late. I think if you stay here - pay the bit extra and go to the \"Club\" level. Maybe there you might find out whether this is really a 5 star hotel or not. In hindsight I wish I hadnt stayed here.

There were however a few issues which spoilt the broader experience - firstly the bar service was appalling with nearly every member in our party reporting some issue. Incorrect orders, wrong items on the bill, bills never arriving (no complaints here on that one!), long delays in orders being filled, unavailable wines that later were successfully ordered by others, topped off by a total lack of clarity regarding whether it was table or bar service and reprimands from waiters for approaching the bar. I was given the incorrect bill three times and finally paid in frustration after trying to explain I was being billed for 3 white wines when I had ordered and was drinking a red. Isolated incidents are understandable however this was almost a culture of incompetence. Our whole group found the experience less than satisfactory and a bit odd considering the food and service in the adjoining restaurant was of a very high quality standard. One recent post noted that some items on the 24 hour menu were not actually available 24 hours. This was also my experience however I ordered an alternative with no problem and it was served promptly.

Receiving a bill under the door for the accommodation even though it had already been paid for by the travel agent. 5. Being greeted by fire fighters due to a water sprinkler bursting outside the restaurant when trying to get our cards reprogrammed at the lobby.

While the staff were efficient in the sign-in, sign-out process, I did encounter a few things that made my stay less enjoyable. The first problem was the room size. The rooms were unexpectedly small. Some websites give the swissotel 5 stars, but this is not accurate. The rooms were designed so there is just barely enough space on either side of the bed for me to move around in. When you look at the photos posted on the hotel's website, the rooms displayed are quite deceptive; the actual room looks about 2/3rd the size. The study desk is small, and cluttered with all the hotel information-related reading materials. The second problem was the bed. The mattress was uncomfortably firm, and I had a difficult time sleeping on it. It was nothing compared to the other beds used in hotels like Sheraton. (i.e. the Heavenly Beds). It took me over 2 hours to fall asleep on these beds. A third problem was the room service. If you need any items from room service (for example a toothbrush), it takes about an hour for room service to have it delivered, which I think is unusually long. So in summary, the stay was a bit on the disappointing side, and I probably would not stay in this hotel again.

I travel to Sydney at least once a month for business purposes (I am a consultant and researcher in services marketing), and like to try out all the different hotels, to get a sense of what is good. Most of the time, money isn't a huge barrier, so I am willing to spend a bit more for a good night's sleep, good service, comfortable surrounds, and a relatively good outlook from my room. Maybe my expectations were a bit high in regard to Swissotel. All things considered, it was okay, but certainly not worthy of being in the Top Ten on TripAdvisor, or of being classified a Five Star Hotel. Some particular problems were: 1. I booked on the hotel's online site, and booked what I thought was a better room, and was given a large-ish room. However, the room had frayed curtains, dirty carpet, smelt of smoke, and was generally not very nice (I realise that this is very broad, but it wasn't what you expect from a \"quality\" hotel). I went back downstairs to reception, and told them that the quality of the room (including the view) was not what I expected when I made the booking. The receptionist wanted specifics, but I wasn't able to be too specific - it just felt old, dated, uncomfortable. I was moved, which I appreciated, and the room I moved to was a bit better, but still not that impressive. 2. The bed was rock-hard. Really, with the advent of technologies such as memory-foam, why do hotels continue to provide such uncomfortable, old beds. The comfort of the bed is part of the core promise, and when it feels cheap, and hard, it really has a huge influence over customer perceptions. 3. Air-conditioning wasn't able to be switched off. This is a problem with a lot of hotels - give your customers the choice. I woke up about ten times in the night, partly because the air-con dried me out, but also because I had to keep adjusting the temperature. And I had a balcony room, so I could have managed room temperature with the window. There were a few other minor things that they really have to look at, such as $30 for breakfast, if you did not book a package - I mean, what are their overheads, when they think it is reasonable to charge $30 for scrambled eggs, bacon, etc. from a bain marie. Just bad marketing as far as I am concerned (and a little mean-spirited), and what it has meant is, that, combined with the issues raised above, plus a few other things, I won't be staying here again, nor will anyone in my company. Some specific details: I paid $289 for a balcony room. Was originally in Room 1220, but was moved to 1820. I booked via the Hotel's website. NB.: I had recently returned from London (in the past two weeks), and had stayed at The Parkcity, which may have spoiled me, and created unreasonable expectations from other hotels. All hotel managers should go and stay at The Parkcity, to see how a hotel in a city as expensive as London can still provide excellent service, attention to detail, and incredible comfort for a reasonable price.", "Date": "August 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carloina", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay, great location\u201d", "Author": "NCtraveler81", "ReviewID": "UR18509316", "Content": "All right, So I spent countless nights researching and trying to decide which hotel to stay in for my first couple of nights in Sydney, and the Swissotel did not dissapoint.

I had high expections seeing as it is a 5* hotel and rated 5th for popularity on TripAdvisor. For reference we were looking for a romantic long weekend in a central location with good spa facilities. POSITIVES For a 5* hotel with 5* rates the Swissotel has the usual positives. Our room was on the corner of the 22nd floor with two large windows facing the Centrepoint Tower. Clean nicely furnished rooms, clean bathrooms with plenty of toiletries - first hotel ive seen that has body gel and body scrub, wall mounted flat screen TV and a coffee machine. Swimming pool was heated and jacuzzi was strong. NEGATIVES TV - is mounted on the wall but does not extend and swivels slightly.. As we were in a corner room with 2 windows, the TV was mounted on the next wall and facing the hallway and bedside table rather then the actual bed. This could just be in the corner room though due to lack of space. Room- again maybe because it was a corner room, but our room was tiny. The armchair actually sat flush between the window and bed. Mimimal towels provided in bathroom. Parking - The hotel faces onto Market Street and does not have its own driveway/entrance. There are 6 no parking/taxi stand spots out front and my partner had to wait in the car for fear of getting booked whilst i ran in to get the concierge/porter/bellboy?? to come out and take our keys. He was quite young and i think i heard him speaking Japanese?, was very efficient and friendly I wish I took down his name. The front entrance consists of a concierge desk and 3 lifts, you need to take the lifts up to the main lobby on level 8 (i.e. the first floor available directly above Myers 7 floors). There are no signs to say checkin on 8th floor. Over the next 3 days we learnt to call for the car at least 20mins before we left the room as we were waiting on a couple of occasions and there is only 2 seats on the ground floor. Also if you return after 11pm there is no-one manning the front desk on the ground floor and you need to swipe with your room key to get in. I could see how this would be annoying if you were checking in late at night. Spa - We chose Swissotel as they have an Amrita spa and we were looking at getting several treatments over the weekend. As it was the long weekend they were naturally busy and we were booked in at 9am. As at other spas and as advised in the hotel directory we arrived 10mins early to fill out paperwork, get changed and use sauna facilities. The spa was deserted and hotel staff were vacumming the general spa/lift area. Not very tranquil. No-one turned up until just after 9am and they were slow to acknowledge us and give us robes/changeroom keys. Even if they were running late they could at least send us to the changerooms/sauna before turning on the computer etc. Breakfast - We were told upon checkin that as we have breakfast until 2pm, if we miss the JPB buffet then to order breakfast in the Crossroads bar. We went down to the bar but there was no-one attending. Went to the restaurant and the girl hurridly advised us if you missed breakfast you order room service. I asked if that meant we get charged and she said yes and walked away. By then there was a girl at the bar and we went and asked her, relaying what reception had told us yesterday and what the restaurant had just told us. She went over to the restaurant and basically said she didnt know what to do about it , can they handle it in the restaurant. By then the girl in the restaurant (Alexandria?) explained to us that they have a function in the restaurant today, to order room service, mention that we have the package and we wont be charged...if she had just said that the first time! Room service breakfast was ok, my bircher muesli looked like leftovers from the buffet - just slop and no fruit or yoghurt on the side. They forgot a few things with my partners full breakfast, e.g. the juice, the pastries but were very quick to bring them up when we rang them. Swipe cards - stopped working twice. Also you need to swipe between floors which i think is unneccessary, i.e. from the pool/spa level within the hotel. Usually you just need to swipe from the lobby access floor? We were charged for 2 days valet upon checkout when it clearly shows what package we are on however they removed it when we told them. OVerall although I have listed quite a few negatives I would stay here again minus the spa activities....its in a prime location for a shopping weekend with the girls so I understand the limited ground floor space and parking issue which in turn compounds the time it takes for them to retrieve your car offsite. But for a romantic quality stay within the same vicinity to shopping I would recommend the Westin or might try the Sheraton next time. The rest of our issues arised from wavering service levels, miscommunication and lack of communication from staff - I recently returned from an overseas trip to Asia and felt like i was back there with the same communication issues on the phone with Room Service, with the Spa and with Restaurant reception.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Queensland", "Title": "\u201cWeekend Away\u201d", "Author": "WeekendWonders", "ReviewID": "UR16789949", "Content": "I stayed two nights at the Swissotel Sydney and it was great.

The trip up to your room - from street level to the 8th floor in one set of elevators and then across the lobby to the hotel elevators to take you to your hotel floor - gets fairly tiresome I must say, when you do it a few times a day! But the rooms are of good size, the beds very firm but comfortable and the bathrooms are large and surprisingly almost opulent. I was bothered also with key cards failing to work. We were also put in a room which overlooked a building site. I was a bit miffed that we had to ask to be moved due to noise (after the third night listening to diggers and pile drivers going all night), and we were given a quieter room. Why didn't the hotel do this first, since the rooms were vacant? Our extended family group had 5 rooms, but none of them had a view - it would have been nice to be given one.

Our stay wasn't perfect but the problems we encountered were put right without us having to complain. We arrived half an hour before our check-in time and were advised that our room wouldn't be ready for an hour. Obviously, this was a little annoying especially when they didn't call us after an hour and when we called them we were told the room still wasn't ready. When we did eventually check-in about an hour and a half after the advised check-in time we were automatically given an upgrade to a Junior Suite. I agree that not having the room ready does not give a good first impression but the quality of the upgrade was more than sufficient compensation. I thought the room was fantastic with views on 3 sides. It was incredibly spacious, clean and well-equipped. Two toilets and two huge flat-screen TVs. I don't know what more anyone could ask for. Contrary to what others have said there were plenty of towels throughout our stay and plenty of reading material about Sydney in the room. I don't know these elements differ between the types of room. We also had a problem where one of the porters dropped a wine bag containing two bottles of wine which we had bought in The Hunter Valley for a friend's wedding. They were very apologetic and were successful in replacing the wine with the same and better wine from the same vineyard. I do think there is a lack of consistency in the service provided by staff though. It is unfair to say all of the staff were unhelpful as some were helpful beyond the call of duty. This was particularly true of one of the Concierges who could not have been more helpful in assisting us with getting our hire car back to Avis. I wish I could remember his name. We did have a further problem with booking a taxi with another Concierge. We booked it for the Friday evening at 1800 and when we went to get it a different Concierge told us that taxis never turn up on a Friday during rush hour so there was no point booking So again, this suggests a lack of consistency amongst the staff.

The hotel has Singapore Airlines as a customer so it would be of a reasonable standard. LOCATION: It is true that the hotel is fairly well located--10 minutes brisk walk (no way can you make it in 5 as someone claimed, and I am a brisk walker--you can feel the breeze I create when I pass you) to the Darling Harbour. There is also a foodcourt below the hotel after you walk out of the building. But the hotel is on a one-way street with no proper driveway space outside the hotel--you park under the monorail, get out on the wrong side of the road, and then get to the hotel. So the bus makes a detour every time in heavy traffic to get to the hotel. Most of the shops around the hotel close at 6.30 pm. As do most restaurants except for a Japanese one with reasonable food but poor service. ROOM: The room is very comfortable indeed. I was hoping for a water view but alas, I was not that fortunate. Possibly the only complaint is that the alarm clock was difficult to set and I'm pretty good at such things. So I resorted to calling the operator for a 5 am call. HOTEL SERVICES: I had the same identical breakfast for the week. Somehow, that is tolerable at home but not in a hotel. I'm surprised at this weak spot given that the food in Australia is fresh and relatively cheap compared with Singapore. A strange phenomenon is that I had to ask for a teaspoon for my coffee every morning. It's somehow the protocol--don't put on a teaspoon unless they ask. The gym is all right although I would not describe it as state of the art. There is a tiny pool. WEAK SPOT: The wired broadband is not cheap. I had the day rate of $24.99. I was told that after 4 days, it would be rounded up to the weekly rate of $99.99. Before checking out, I found that the hotel had billed me everyday at $24.99 a day. I clarified with the reception and they said, ok, we will bill you for four days. But the following day when my colleague went to pay, it was back to $24.99x7. That got sorted but I wonder what would have happened had I not raised the issue. The hotel shares the building with apartments. So everyday, it was: get to Floor 8, walk across the lobby, and then insert card to get to desired floor. It's a bit of a hassle when you are tired at the end of the day. My self-closing door could not close properly and I was not aware of it the first day so it was ajar for much of the time I was out that day. I had to slam the door each time I left. It took 5 days of me nagging the chambermaid to get that fixed. CONCLUSION So I won't rave about this hotel. It's not a bad hotel. But in all probability, I would ok it for a friend but I myself would probably not stay there.

From the airport, I took the train to the Town Hall Station but the taxis I hailed refused to take me to the hotel presumably because of the short distance. It took me a while to locate the hotel entrance. A walk across Myers Department Store led me to the elevators which took me up to the front desk. Check in was done in ten minutes - five minutes waiting for my turn (it was nearly 7pm) and five minutes for the usual check in routine. My room, somewhat smaller than what I had expected, was cosy and inviting with wood panelling and furniture, and a wall mounted flat screen TV. I had expected picture windows but found apartment-type windows from which I could see all the hotel's neighbouring buildings (a bit too close for comfort). I liked the kimonos and the nifty coffee maker, but could not help comparing Swissotel Sydney with its sister hotels in Bangkok and Singapore whose rooms are much more spacious and had nice city views. Location-wise, Swissotel Sydney is like Swissotel The Stamford in Singapore, with shopping in the same complex but the latter's rooms all come with balconies with full length sliding glass doors, better equipped meeting rooms, an in-house convention centre and the subway at its basement. However, Swissotel Sydney has newer rooms/furniture and is just one block away from the monorail which serves the city centre. Both Swissotel Sydney and Swissotel Nai Lert Park (in Bangkok) appear to have been recently renovated but in terms of service, the latter stands out with its bellhops ever ready to lend a helping hand with luggage and hailing taxis, and smiling and helpful reception staff. Swissotel Sydney's staff were courteous and efficient but seemed to lack the X factor in making guests feel right at home. I think Swissotel Sydney suits the leisure traveller more than the business traveller. Broadband speeds are excellent but the meetign rooms while ok are not impressive; to reach the business district or the convention centre, one would still need to cab it or walk to the train station and monorail respectively. For shoppers with spare cash to splurge on nice hotels, Swissotel Sydney is a good base to drop off shopping bags before continuing with more retail therapy. It is also within walking distance to Hyde Park if one needs a respite from the city bustle, and Darling Harbour, with its watering holes can be reached on foot or via the monorail.", "Date": "October 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cPlush and pleasant\u201d", "Author": "dublin_boy", "ReviewID": "UR10162703", "Content": "Had a 2 night stay here on a holiday trip.

The only good thing about this hotel is the location, right next to Pitt St Mall (fantastic shopping!), near Town Hall Station and a 10 minute walk to the Rocks and Circular Quay, which is one of the most beautiful parts of any city I've seen. The worst thing about this hotel was the service. It was absolutely shocking, across all areas - and I'm far from fussy when it comes to service, promptness and a smile is all it takes to make me happy. The first offender was concierge.. we arrived quite late (11pm), lugged our bags inside, were not greeted at all and, without looking up, the guy grunted 'check-in is on level 8'. No offer to take our bags, no greeting, nothing. No matter who was there, they remained equally as rude and disinterested our entire stay. Check in was just as bad, I've never waited so long, no apology for the wait, no smile or welcome. I had upgraded our room to one on the executive club floors and there was a confusion with this, which annoyed me because I'd expressly told the reservations girl that I wanted it to be a surprise for my husband. We, again, lugged our bags to our room ourselves and were given no instruction as to breakfast, pool and gym levels and closing times, facilities, nothing. The room was nice enough, but NOTHING (and I mean NOTHING) like the hotel's website, especially not the executive club rooms. Our room wasn't even as nice as the standard picture shown on the website, and I wish I hadn't bothered wasting my money on the upgrade. It wasn't spacious at all, in fact a little on the small side compared to other hotels I've stayed in, and we had no view of the harbour at all, as promised by the website. The bathroom was nicely appointed with a seperate bath and shower but we had to ring housekeeping to get 2 towels (when the booking was for 2 people??) The turndown service at night was a good touch, with chocolates on the pillow, and the cleanliness was of an ok standard (if a little dusty). That brings me to the Executive Club. What an absolute joke. Seriously, help-yourself lukewarm party pies and curry puffs do not constitute 'canapes'. And the measly selection of 'hot' food was ALWAYS luke warm, even though we got there at 5.45pm. It took such a long time for them to replenish anything, and as for the cheese board (no cold meats, just a few cheeses and water crackers), once a type of cheese was gone, that was it for the rest of the night. You had to serve your own drinks, which my husband enjoyed because he was free to have triple shots of bourbon, but part of what I paid for was 'service', which wasn't provided at all. The breakfast up there was even worse. Baked beans, ham and cheese croissants, spinach puffs, scrambled eggs were among the foods that always ran out, taking at least half an hour to replace (if they were replaced at all). On our third day there they ran out of cutlery and juice glasses! When I asked the 'attendant' (said very sarcastically - he was completely hopeless) if he knew there were no juice glasses he replied \"Yes - I know\". No apology, explanation, nothing! I've actually worked business club service in a 4-star hotel and if we ran out of anything it was the absolute sin of all sins, but at the Swissotel noone cared. Breakfast downstairs was almost as bad. Not to mention the fact that they tried to make us pay, even though I'd paid for it in my original booking, the amount for breakfast wasn't refunded when I upgraded, AND the reservations girl who I arranged the upgrade with expressly told me I could eat at both. None of that seemed to matter with staff, who argued with me for at least 10 minutes until we finally agreed to just eat upstairs for the rest of our stay. They had the same issues with replacing food, I've never seen anything like it. Honestly, I'm actually quite easy to please, but I was so disappointed with this hotel especially as it was supposed to be such a special time for me and my husband. Business travellers and those just passing through would probably be ok with it but I don't recommend it at all for people wanting a romantic getaway.

There has been criticism of the hard beds but that did not worry me. We were able to enjoy Happy Hour in the Lounge in the evenings and there was a very substantial offering of savouries, biscuits and cheese etc. which easily substituted for our evening meal. Breakfast consisted of eggs, bacon, cereal and fruit etc. There was also free computer access.
