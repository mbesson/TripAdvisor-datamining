It is however a short stroll to the Vatican so I really enjoyed daily trips to St Peters Square to relax and appreciate where I was. The trip into Rome was very easy on the Metro, and every night I loved coming back to the local charms. The local food is amazing and I found the shopping to be the best. So many little boutiques with reasonable prices. The hotel was lovely, private and the staff will be there for you every minute if you want, or leave you in peace if that is what you want. It is hard to locate for a driver, and it has 2 small but wide flights of stairs to climb with luggage.

The hotel, although it only consists of a few rooms 5 i think, was easy to find and located close to local shops, the metro link (even though we only used it once) and Vatican city, about a 10-15 min walk. The location was great for us since we enjoy walking around and stumbling across landmarks or sites of interest. The one time we used the metro was when we were on our way home and my suitcase had broken. The room had a nice double bed and a marble bathroom there was minimal noise from the street and towels were provided. The room was clean and felt homely and characterful which we is what we perfer as aposed to the sterile modern finishes that are found in large new builds. Breakfast was proved which was pretty basic, some cereals, breads, jams, croissants and yoghurt. There was a 24 hour reception so although the doors were locked at night you just had to knock or buzz to get in. We found the staff friendly although they didn't speak much english but there was no need for them to. While in Rome we visited St Peters (well worth climbing for the view), Vatican museum (got a bit lost), the colosseum, city museum, spanish steps, the majority of the fountains and numerous churches, botanical gardens, pantheon and other stuff i can't properly remember since we did randomly walk in the general direction of things and see others by accident. Having tea outside the pantheon is well worth doing as is seeing the colosseum at night. To be honest there is so much to see its hard to put priority on anything. We could easily go back. We would recommend this hotel to couples wanting a quieter getaway that has a good location and is really reasonable.

If you have luggage or travel with older ppl, don't stay here - There are 2 flights of stairs to this 'hotel' (apartment), situated between lift floors. The stairs being narrow is pretty hard to get the luggage up. THERE IS NO PORTER and the HOTEL PPL DO NOT HELP YOU!!!! 2. BROKEN TOILETS THAT DO NOT FLUSH, SHOWERS get flooded because of the poor plumbing - There seems to be some plumbing issue with the bathrooms (The plumber later told us it is a consistent issue) - the water will not go down. We told the reception of our problem and he doesn't seem to care and said that too many ppl were showering at the same time. Seriously?!!!! - My family in the suite room had it even worse : Their toilets won't flush and were told its our fault and that we shouldn't use the toilet and the shower at the same time. WHO DOES THAT. In the end, the shower can't be used entirely. WHen we asked for a change of rooms, they said they were all out. THIS IS THE WORST BIT - We will be leaving the next day and my family member was unwell and resting in the room that afternoon. The hotel wants to have a part causing the flushing issue to be replaced, however, it will not be fixed in our stay there and insisted on removing the part that day. LOOK, some one is resting! We told them that they can do this tomorrow sinmce they informed us that they had no ppl in the room after we left. They insisted that they have to get it done and the plumber will be here in 30mins, then 1 hour then they eventually came at five. The very rude receptionist was shouting at us after the hour wait because we questioned the time of arrival of the plumber. Look someone is sick and trying to rest and they made them wait. Like one hotel staff shouting wasn't enough, 2 of the staffs, shouted at us saying that they are already going to take 50Euros off. WHat do you want - You want the toilet fixed or the discount? I told them that they couldn't get anything fixed whilst we're there and they went into a frenzy! Is this how you talk to your clienteles? 3. Cleanliness - The place feels a bit grimey - Like after you wipe the place down with a dirty cloth. The sheets in some of the rooms were stained. 4. General amenities - Airconditioning in the rooms don't work so we had to open our windows which were very noisy as it was two floors up and next to a main road!

On the positive side, the rooms are clean and nicely furnished, and appear to be fairly recently renovated. Location is also a plus, withing a walking distance from the Vatican Museum and just a 2-minute walk from the metro. Now about the place itself. This is not really a hotel, this appears to be an old (although nicely renovated) apartment with many rooms, with the front desk located in what would be the corridor, and the kitchen/breakfast room in one of the rooms. The doors are thin as you would expect them in an apartment room, and therefore, as others have noted, there is absolutely no privacy and no quiet. You can hear someone whisper at the front desk, let alone the noise from the breakfast room. Needless to say, everything you do or say in your room, including going to the bathroom, watching TV, and whatever else you are planning to enjoy on your vacation, will be heard by others. We did not complain as it was pointless, but another guest did, and it seems to me his polite complaints were not received nicely, as there was a loud argument and lots of frustration on both sides. Another drawback is that there was no free wireless internet. Other hotels in Italy offered this free service, but not this hotel. The security box in our room was broken, but we were informed about it only after the person at the front desk heard us trying to use it (through the closed door) and offered to keep the valuables in the general hotel safe. Another drawback which might be an issue for some people is the lack of an elevator. Not only that, but when we buzzed from the street, we were simply informed that there is no elevator and we need to go up--with the luggage. No one was sent to help us, and there is no way I would be able to carry the suitcase myself if I were to travel without my husband. Another minor issue is that there is no one at the front desk at night, and if you come back late, you can't even pick up the belongings in your safe, or ask questions. The questions, by the way (of which I had but a couple, i.e. where can I buy the Roma Pass), where NOT answered. In general, I felt that we were at a house of a friend of a friend of a friend, with the host not objecting to our stay, but not exactly welcoming us either. Considering that this is Rome, and there are many hotels there in this price range, I would most definitely go for something else.", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Room and Excellent Location\u201d", "Author": "rclerkin", "ReviewID": "UR25442131", "Content": "I have to say I was very very happy with our stay in the Il Gattopardo Relais hotel. We arrived out of the taxi to the hotel door (Which doesn't stand out on the street at all ... press number 2 on the buzzer). After telling the lady at the desk we had a reservation the door was buzzed open and we walked up a winding marble staircase to the 1st floor (There's no lift so you'll have to carry those bags). The hotel is on a single floor in the building with reception in the hall that all the doors face onto. Rooms are individually named and we stayed in the Lampadeza room (I think that's the spelling!). The room was large with high ceilings (13 foot I'd say), much larger than anywhere I'd stayed in Paris for the same price. The fittings in the room have a definite Boutique style which I think the ladies will appreciate more than the men. The main thing was that the room felt quite lavish with plenty of space. The TV was a bit out of place but I'm ready to forgive that. My only gripe about the room was that the bed was 2 smaller beds pushed together (which seems to be getting increasingly popular in budget hotels). The matresses were past the point of firm and getting to the point of hard. The bathroom extended the sense of space with a large sink and mirror, a full bath and a shower run from the taps in the bath. The shower was very powerful unlike the weak dribbles you sometimes have to deal with. I feel I should address the noise issue that another user here experienced. For our stay this was definitely not as big an issue. We did find that the door to the hall could do with some extra sound proofing but the noise coming through the door did not carry on through unsociable hours. You can hear conversations being carried on in the reception area but we did not hear the receptionist typing or filing. Unless the other guests keep particularly unsociable hours the noise is not going to be an issue. The location is fabulous. Step out the door and walk to your left for 2 minutes. At the metro entrance turn right and walk ahead for a further 8 minutes and you walk directly into St. Peter's Square. The metro line is 3 stops from the Spanish steps and 8 stops (including one change to linea B) from the Coloseum. Altogether I was very very happy with this hotel and the location and I would gladly recommend it to anybody wishing to stay there.

I'm afraid I didn't find this hotel to be what I would have expected given the reviews. I am honestly not one for ranting negatively but I need to give a brief detail of the issues I found with this hotel - Main problem was the noise from the main corridor. We arrived late went straight to bed after a tiring flight for 9:30pm. The reception desk is a few feet from the bedroom door, in fact all bedroom doors! The person on recpetion had conversations on the phone and in person with other guests all night, right outside the door! We could hear every word that was spoken and no attempt was made to keep the noise down. Also while working on the computer and doing paper work we could hear everything. I accept fully that the person on reception needs to carry out their work but the proximity to all bedroom doors is always going to be a problem. Our room happened to be next to the breakfast room, so no luck there. Breakfast started to be prepared at 7am and as a result we were woken with loud banging and the noise of the coffee grinder. The room was spotlessly clean but was small and darkly grim. I accept that we arrived at night, but the room was depressingly dark and was not a place that I would have looked forward to coming back to after a long day in Rome. As I said I would not have looked forward to coming back each day to this hotel and facing a night of disturbed sleep so myself and my wife checked out the next morning and moved to another hotel. This hotel seems to be fine for the vast majority of guests so I would not rule out this hotel out based on my experience. It just wasn't for me. The noise in the main corridor was too much of an issue, it might be okay for you.

As you will note from other reviews, this is not a large hotel with a sign outside and flashy entrance, It is basically one floor in an apartment block which has been converted into hotel rooms with a reception in the middle. But the apartment block itself is a quaint old block with huge wooden doors and a pretty spiral staircase and seems to be made up mainly of offices apart from the hotel. Make sure you take specific directions with you as the street numbering is very confusing. Once inside it is a well looked after hotel with antique style furniture rather than a modern look but this fits in well with the style of the rooms. Our only gripe was that the first room we were given had clearly not been cleaned from the last occupant - which we realise when we went to get showered and there were dirty towels on the floor in the bathroom .However, when we pointed this out we were quickly moved into another room which was actually bigger and nicer than the first. Plenty of space, high ceilings and decent size bathroom. Our room overlooked the main road so I could imagine that those sensitive to noise might find it a little noisy but we had no trouble sleeping in the massive and very comfortable bed. There was plenty of hotwater, blankets and the room was warm enough given it was still quite cold. Location wise it is within walking distance of the vatican city but also very close to the metro line A which enables you to get around most of the city very easily. At night you would need to get a cab home as the metro closes a little early. We paid 315 euros for 3 nights which included breakfast.

Rome can be a hard place to live as public transport can be severely affected by traffic, only two tube lines for such a big town, and \"il gattopardo \" is only at 15 minutes walking distance from the Vatican and connected by tube to all the touristic sites in no more than 15 minutes. Note anyway that the tube in Rome shuts down very early, 10 in the evening is the last ride ,so if you wish to go out overnight you can take a taxi. Try to avoid the independent ones as they have the very bad habit of charging irreasonable prices sometimes. The area is perfectly served with internet points, bars and restaurants, and one of them, \"il Toscano\", really deserves a go as it is also mentioned on the \"Gambero rosso\" guide, and it is only two buildings away from the BB. The first impression was anyway a bit annoying for me as there is no lift leading to this ancient big refurbished apartment made of 5 (or 6? can't remember) big beautifully decorated rooms, which look very much like the pictures you find on their website, and this was not mentioned anywhere.The staff does not take any care of helping to bring your luggage upstairs on the 2nd floor where it is located, also because there is only one person at the reception. Anyway the room I chose was really beautiful and cleanliness probably its best feature as well as the style, beautiful charming antiques, luxury curtains, beautiful bathroom with oval cabin shower, spotless. There are a few details I did not like very much though, one is that the breakfast room is really very small, meaning that you litterally have your breakfast side by side with the barman, and only two small cafe' tables. I was the only customer that day but I guess it can be really uncomfortable if they were fully booked. I had required some decaf which was assured to me on the phone when i booked but the first day they had forgotten it, which meant I had to have my own breakfast out, despite paying for that. The thing that really annoyed me though is that the 2 ladies owners shout very loud when talking to people or on the phone and slam doors without care, and as this is an ancient apartment in which the reception is right in the middle of a corridor, surrounded by all the 5 rooms, it can be really noisy, I was awaken at 7 when they start working. I even caught one of them shoutin so unpolitely and so loud at some customer on the phone that I litterally could hear each word she said, and this lack of class really sounded awful and not matching the charm of this beautiful and clean place. The rest of the staff was really nice, the 2nd day I had my breakfast served in the room by the room maid and on my departure the room man helped me with my heavy case downstairs which I really appreciated. Rooms are also served by independent and powerful heating and telehone, as well as satellite sky tv, but only with the sky world channels and the sport ones, you can pay for movies if you wish, and on the remote a button allows you to change your language to English if required.
