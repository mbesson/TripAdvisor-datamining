It's only a short 15 min walk from the lido docks and easy to find. There's always a friendly welcome from staff. The room was ground floor and sadly quite dark but the hotel must have been full at the time so we couldnt swap. It was clean though and cosy. The breakfast was fine but no hot menu but plenty of cereals, pastries etc. Overall its a reasonable stay. It's not what we would call a 3 star but fine for a stay while looking round the city, also quite nice to be away from the centre. One thing that did annoy us was the charge of 5 euros for an hours wifi! After paying 80euro a night you would expect it to be free like in the cafes!!!", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "wobblywombats", "ReviewID": "UR117571689", "Content": "We found this hotel through an information/booking place on the road just before Venice island. We were told three stars and quiet. We were given a map with exact location and told of easy parking along a quiet back lane. The hotel is on Lido island and the boat to venice was supposed to be just a few minutes walk. I see this hotel more as a Bed and Breakfast than a three stars. We had difficulties finding it as it was along a back lane insted of the exact cross from the plan. Parking space along the specified back lane was hard to find. You have to catch the bus for the boat to Venice. Of course you can walk there but with the heat, the distance and the knowledge you will be walking all day, you are better catching the bus. The hotel is an old house in a back lane. It is clean and comfortable. The room was small. The beds small but comfortable. The reception was friendly but assertive. They were helpful and gave us tourist advices. Small maintenance problem:The bathroom fan would not switch off unless we cut the power off first for a few minutes then put the card back in the room electricity slot. We forgot to tell them so we can't blame them.The breakfast was good, the waitress friendly and helpful. We could leave our luggages downstairs after checking out while we went to explore Venice. We paid 140 euro for two with breakfast. I don't know if we paid too much, but we did not have a choice and our stay was good.

To my mind, the second nearest hotel to the congress centre is the Westin, which was way beyond my budget. I did read the other reviews before staying at the Tiziana, which I must say caused a bit more alarm than reality. The room that I stayed in was clean, there was air-conditioning, and the bathroom appeared to be newly renovated. There was no internet access though, not even at the lobby, so I had to rely on the internet access provided during the congress. Breakfast was Continental buffet style, consisting of some pasteries, cereal and bread \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were no eggs, fried, bacon or sausages \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which I could see caused disappointment to some diners. Coming back to the issue of location, one should be made aware that the hotel is on the island of Lido, and the main attractions of Venice are on Venice island, which takes about half an hour to reach by ferry. That is not to say that staying on Lido island is without merit \u00e2\u20ac\u201c other than the fact that the congress centre is located here (which is also the venue for the Venice Film Festival), people from the mainland come over Lido island during the weekends to enjoy the beach, and the public beach takes half an hour by foot to reach from the Tiziana hotel. Some reviewers have complained that the hotel may be a bit difficult to locate, and I would tend to concur with this observation. So, here is how I suggest you get to the hotel: when at Venice airport, buy the Venice card which includes Alilaguna ferry rides. Take the one-hour Alilaguna ferry ride from the airport to Lido island. When you reach the SME ferry stop on Lido island, take a taxi to the hotel, which is only about a 5 minute drive away, and which should cost around Euro $10. The hotel is located on a side road that is off the main road that the bus travels, which explains why the hotel may be a bit difficult to locate for the uninitiated. Once you become more familiar with the place, you can easily take the bus to and fro the ferry stop, and there are a couple of ferries from Lido island that go to the main island (where you can visit St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s place etc.). Finally, to the question of whether I would stay at this hotel again \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yes, the hotel is a pleasant place to stay with a homely, laid-back feel, and the surrounding area appears to be crime-free. I would add a caveat, and that is, I would stay here again if there I was attending a congress here. On the other hand, if I were in Venice to visit the attractions, I would instead stay on the main island.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin , Ireland", "Title": "\u201cFalse Advertising\u201d", "Author": "DublinGirl85", "ReviewID": "UR16858223", "Content": "This should not be advertised as a 3 star hotel, it is better described as a modest B&B.They also say there 5 min from the boat but it takes over 10 min.They boast 'private beach upon request'.

Breakfast was perhaps the weakest of all. Dont expect any cooked breakfast. They only served basic continental breakfast. I personally did not find the staff friendly nor helpful. My friend took a piece of biscuit from breakfast bar back to our room and the next day we got told off in the lounge. We asked whether we could leave our luggage in the hotel after checking out.
