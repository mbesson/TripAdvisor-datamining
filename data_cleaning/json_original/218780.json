This is actually the first time I am writing a somewhat negative review about a hotel. Now don't get me wrong, I knew there were going to be renovations. That itself was not the issue. For Westin's reputation, I expected better. There were problems with the hot water. Basically we got frozen than burned in the showers. Other occupants complained of the same thing that weekend. The only good night was Thursday night before they decided to fix the boiler!!! There were problems with the heater, they sent someone up to fix it, it never really worked. We didn't bother calling them again because it wasn't like we were freezing at night. The WORST was the lack of housekeeping services for us. We made the mistake of deciding to go \"green\" during check in. When we changed our minds the next morning, we were told that housekeeping service would be provided for sure. We get back to the hotel at night, no housekeeping. Next morning, early morning, we go down to front desk and ask for housekeeping service again and informed them that they never came the day earlier. Once again, we were told that for sure housekeeping would stop by. In the end, we complained again that third night with zero housekeeping services and they kindly gave me thousands of SPG reward points. But I highly doubt I would stay at another Westin in the future. I've stayed at hotels with less stars and they have been better!!!

That being said, the renovations were for the most part not an issue. There are two points that you should be aware of: there is a lobby bar/deli counter instead of an actual bar or restaurant. This isn't a big deal because there are dozens of great bars and restaurants very close to the hotel. The other problem I faced is with the hot water. They had just replaced the hot water boiler/heater and air bubbles in the hot water lines would disrupt the flow of hot water to my shower. The problem seemed to be transient and there wasn't really anything the engineers could do to fix it, but a couple of showers where you lose hot water mid-shower is quite annoying. Others have posted complaints about the noise of renovation. It did not bother me, but I was out of the room most of the day. Other than that, the hotel was decent. I requested a room that would be quiet at night and was given a room at the end of the hall (thank you!). I could hear people in the stairwell, but that was very unusual. The room was comfortable, clean, and fairly large. Noise isolation was mixed. I could hear toilets flushing and some street noise (on the 9th floor), but I didn't hear conversations or TV from neighboring rooms. I didn't hear the trains, trolley, and only heard one plane (the airport is not very far). Location is excellent, it's adjacent to Horton Plaza, the large downtown mall and the Gaslamp Quater. It's a 10 minute walk to the convention center and also has easy access to the trolley and train station. I didn't have a car, but I understand that parking is quite expensive. I really like the \"green choice\" option. $5 or 500 points for each day I don't use housekeeping. Considering I rarely need housekeeping when I'm traveling alone, this is a nice benefit for me and the hotel. I didn't use the pool or gym, so I cannot comment on either. Nice touches: available outlets on the desk and at the bedside. Little things done wrong: 1) ethernet cable was woefully short; I had to move the computer to the back of the desk to connect it. Yes, there is WiFi, but when wired is available, I prefer it because it is faster and more secure. 2) The alarm clock does not support mp3/ipods. This is the first post-renovation hotel I've stayed in that didn't have an alarm clock with this connectivity.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cHuge Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Goosebump6", "ReviewID": "UR126553222", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel for a conference last year and was impressed overall.

So Glad I Wasn't Picking Up the Tab\u201d", "Author": "Brad1970", "ReviewID": "UR125657372", "Content": "Okay if you look at my review history, you'll see I trend towards very positive reviews. The one stars from me are extremely rare and only when I note egregious problems. I certainly found those right here at the Westin. I stayed here for five nights and had the absolute worst experience ever in a hotel. Let me preface this by saying my review is NOT about the issues surrounding construction. I'll hit on those, but the problems went far deeper than that. For starters, due to the heavy construction, you can't even enter the hotel from the main street. They could keep the main entrance open but decided to put a sign in front blocking guests from entering the easy way. After driving around for an extra 15 minutes, I finally found the secret entrance and could squeeze into the very narrow way. Upon checking into my room, I noticed a nice white robe hanging up in my bathroom. Upon closer inspection I saw a blood stain on it! I've included a photo here in my review. I don't use hotel robes anyway but it was unnerving seeing it there. I decided to leave it up for the entire week to see if the cleaning staff would notice and remove it. They didn't. It gets worse. The climate control in room was well, out of control. It was so hot I literally had to flip my pillow over in the night so I wouldn't be laying on a wet pillow. Gross but true. The front desk blamed it on construction but the thermostat wouldn't let me turn the setting below 65 degrees. I think that was the problem, not the construction. But okay, while we're on construction, the worst part of that involved the elevators. First, you had to walk a long, loud maze of dusty construction just to get to them. And two out of four were completely down and you had to wait in long lines just to jam into one like a sardine. In the mornings, when I wanted to go downstairs, I had to take the elevator up to the top floor to get into a short line and ride it down. Otherwise, the elevator would be too full by the time it got to me and have to pass me by. It gets worse. One day, for no apparent reason, the cleaning staff completely missed my room. I did not have the Do Not Disturb sign up or anything, they just missed me. I went down personally to let the front desk know. They apologized and said they'd make sure it got clean tomorrow. Well thanks a lot. That doesn't do me much good now. Did I mention they charge for WiFi? Something else I found odd was that the remote control to my TV had apparently been used so much that all of the numbers except the 5 were completely worn off (see photo). Now my TV at home gets used a lot more every day than a hotel remote possibly could and my numbers are not worn off. This is just another indication of the lack of attention to detail I consistently saw here. Upon check out, the lady asked how my visit went. I told her it was rough. She blamed it on the construction. Nothing more. No apology. Nothing. I was extremely disappointed in the multiple problems I encountered. Most concerning to me was the hotel staff's reluctance to try to do anything at all about it. An offer, some points, a free future stay once construction is complete, a bottle of champagne, a plate of cookies - anything would have been a nice gesture. But nothing at all was offered at any time despite these issues. What's funny is I'm usually a Marriott point person and try to stay in Marriotts whenever I travel (as you'll see in my reviews). This time I decided to change things up a bit and give a Westin a try. I'm very sorry that I did. Marriott?

There are 4 elevators and we didn't wait too long for them, but I can see how some people complain about the wait. The elevators are small, so depending on how much luggage one person has, you may only be able to fit 2-3 people in one elevator. Our room was clean, neat and nicely updated. The bed was comfortable and nice size. As with many hotels, it's wider instead of longer, so if you're over 6'3\", your feet may hang off the bed, but again I've noticed this is the norm for all the hotels now. If you're a TV watcher, you may be disappointed at their short list of channel choices. The shower was nice and hot, water pressure was great, and the bathroom was big enough for two people to get ready in. The automatic lights in the hallway never came on during the night as some people have said, but the one in the bathroom did. We just closed the door to the bathroom so even if it did turn on, we weren't bothered. One thing that did bother us was that every time someone closed their door to their room, it slammed, which made our room shake. Nothing serious, but annoying.

The primary purpose was to attend a meeting (which was taking place in this hotel) so I had booked the hotel on that basis. I had not reviewed the tripadvisor review prior to the booking. Here are findings: a. The hotel is going through some renovation on ground facility so it is difficult to go through in and out. Not sure how long this construction will last. b. After check-in I saw a cockroach (literally 1 1/2\" long) -- near elevator (close to their check-in desk). I pulled their staff and showed. Instead of taking care of this pest, the reaction from their employee is that this is to be expected as the hotel is in downtown. (From my standpoint, this is sorry excuse and from that point on, I was concerned of what to expect at this facility.) c. The hotel is wired for wi-fi; however, the reception is not always good -- depending upon the location. d. The fees for Wi-Fi is expensive (almost $60 for one week). Also you can't use wi-fi on your mobile device (such as iPhone or iPad) along with your personal computer. It allows you to access Internet on one or the other but no both. e. The room was OK; however, the ironing board in the room is very small and when expanded, it only reaches 3\" ft height so you better bend in order to use it. f. The TV and supported channels -- basic cable. For class of this hotel, I would have expected more. Certainly they were pushing for on-demand movies and adult entertainment programs. g. Housekeeping stuff -- ought to be reminded -- as they kept forgetting soap for shower or facial washing I used their gym and the facility was OK. You can watch TV while excercising on many equipments. However, you can't change the channel so unless you content to watch CNN all times, you will be disappointed. Had attended meetings in the hotel and the meeting rooms were OK. We had breakfast served in the meeting rooms and I am not sure how it may compare with standard breakfast served in their restaurent. The best part of the hotel was that it was close to other dining places within walking distance and you have lot of choices for dinner.

The same morning, we attended the front desk to check out, utterly impressed. We informed the staff of what had happened overnight who subsequently denied that any construction had taken place in the early hours of the morning! We suggested that she checked our records which she subsequently did. Realising her mistake, she then apologised to us.

Courtesy, respect, knowledge, and friendliness of the front desk are the \"price of admission\" at 4 and 5 star hotels; so it is not these characteristics to which I refer. Instead, I am talking about the manner in which the hotel staff responds to minor issues and special requests, and the extent to which a desire to deliver service excellence is evident across all employees one encoutners during a stay. (Incidentally, the Ritz Carlton is particualrly effective at hiring and training its staff along these lines, going so far as empowering each employee - from the maids to the managers - to settle customer disputes or requests on the spot up with offerings valued up to a certain dollar threshhold). My stay at the Westin Gaslamp was marked by service excellence in a variety of shapes and sizes: the ease with which my request to change rooms was handled by the front desk despite being sold out, the courtesy of the room service attendant who returned to my room to bring me a replacement meal due to a very minor mix-up on their part - after I had already told him I was happy to eat what they delivered (they ended up giving me two meals for the price of one), and the manager who allowed me to extend my stay at the last minute even though the property was oversold, to name a few.

I think it just stems from my belief that most hotels are overpriced, and the \"luxury\" hotels often charge for all their flash but sacrifice important substance, like vital room features (comfort, amenities, etc.). Have you noticed some restaurants do this too? They are all too happy to charge you $100+ for a tasteless, skimpy meal, in the name of their trendy atmosphere. Priorities sometimes get mixed up! That's a little how I felt for the one night I stayed at the Westin Gaslamp Quarter in San Diego, CA. Here is my review in a supposed nutshell: Positives: I was on the 12th floor, which had a wonderful view of the skyline (especially at night), and the room's windows (which do crack open for fresh air) were large and attractively dressed, with drapes and scroll-down shades. The furniture, including a dark wood desk and bar area above the fridge, was clean and comfy and well-made. The room had a fairly large plasma style TV, but I did not turn it on. The shower was spacious with one of those new style curving curtains, a head that flowed well, a drain that did not clog, and high quality soap and shampoo. I also was impressed with the bathroom mirror, which had a florescent light built into the back--giving a mellow, romantic, yet well-lit glow around its frame, like a solar eclipse. The negatives: The woman at the check-in counter had some communication and customer service disabilities that forced me to use my diplomacy and communication talents when my colleague was getting frustrated over a room charge concern that she did not know how to handle, so a manager had to take over before it was resolved. The bathroom did not have a fan! Hello? Four star hotel? The bathroom sink also had low water pressure. I realize it's the 12th floor, but please solve this at some point. The fridge was extremely small and built into the console style bar with a large wood door, so every time you needed to get into the fridge you had to open this large wood door and then the fridge door. Kind of inconvenient and retarded, if you ask me. It's funny how luxury places also like to nickel and dime you for all the \"extras.\" The small spring water bottle sitting atop the bar that looks complimentary and should be, is a mere $5 my friend. Sitting next to the bottle is the typical price list for all the overpriced snacks and drinks offered by many hotels that are supposed to be in the fridge, but we not in this case--nothing else was to be found. I can't think of any other annoying things I came across at this time, fortunately.

When I got to my room - very nice room - I found no remote control. Annoying but not deal breaking. I reported it and one was placed in my room whilst I was out to dinner. The main issue was with water penetration to the room one night. I reported the issue at 3.30am, when it had woken me up and was told it was a broken pipe. There was nothing at that hour which could be done except put down towels to soak up water. You then lie there awake and listen to the dripping until you eventually fall asleep again.

We requested for a connecting room when we booked, and we didn't get it. Asked again to see if there is any (we were traveling with 2 little kids and connecting rooms were essential), and we were told that there is none available. So we took 2 rooms right next to each other on the 9th floor and as soon as we got off from the elevator on the 9th, it smelled like someone has been smoking on the floor for hours. It was so bad. We got into our room and noticed the smell was leaking into our room, so we called Service Exp. and asked for a room change. We were then told that there is a connecting room and were told that someone is bein sent with new sets of keys. We waited for about good 20 minutes and no one came. I decided to just go down to the front rest and get new keys myself and I did. This lady at the front was exceptionally friendly and helpful unlike the guy who checked us in. We went to our new connecting room on 5th floor and we were waiting for a baby crib which we have requested. Good 20 minutes passed and no one came. Called the front and they didn't know about the crib request so they made a request for us. After all this stressful hassle, realized that check in and settling down took us about 2 and a half painful hours. And then later in the evening, we discovered that the heater in one of our rooms were not working. Someone was sent to fix it but it still didn't work.

Okay, I've had it up to my head and didn't wanted to let all the troubles get to me, but this is just down right ridiculous.

It abuts Horton Plaza with its myriad stores and restaurants and is a short walk to the main drag of the Gaslamp Quarter and its many shops, restaurants, theatres, etc. The building itself seems somewhat shoe-horned onto its site but every inch of space is used to its fullest advantage. Oddly, while there appears to be a shuttle service to/from San Diego's conveniently close-in airport, there's none offered from the nearby Amtrak station. I'd flown into LAX, took the great and reasonably priced express bus from there to Union Station, then the train down to San Diego (especially scenic from San Juan Capistrano southward along the coast). I did this as flights were cheaper in and out of LAX and I was ending my trip at a sister Westin property near LAX anyhow. Yes, you could conceivably walk from the train station to the hotel, but I was dead-tired after my long drive to the airport, the plane trip itself, the bus connection in Los Angeles and the train ride down to San Diego. So I simply cabbed it. Upon checking in, I asked for a room close to an ice machine as I have insulin I needed to chill. I was told I'd only be 5-6 rooms away from the ice machine but, in fact, was at the opposite end of the hall. Ironically, there was a mini-fridge in the room, so this was a moot point. However, one would think the check-in clerk might have connected those dots and offered me that reassurance. The room was sleek, well-furnished, and, miracle or miracles, reasonably well-lit for nighttime reading. Happily, there was also a convenient wall plug for my sleep apnea machine. Amenities and housekeeping were all adequately up to snuff. There is a restaurant in the hotel offering the standard buffet breakfast (bountiful but eggs, potatoes, and cooked meats are often tepid at best as is the case with most breakfast buffets), but I suspect most guests opt for dining off-site as San Diego hardly lacks a wide array of fine restaurants, many within easy walking distance of the hotel (Dobson's being just a few steps from the front door to say nothing of Horton Plaza's top-level food court). The hotel's computers for guest use are in a nook at the in-house branch of Starbuck's which, however, has limited hours and access. There's a convenient full-service Post Office next door to the hotel as well. While there were complimentary copies of USA Today at the hotel, I walked to a nearby newsstand/kiosk to purchase a New York Times. I booked this hotel on Hotwire and got what I felt was a fantastic rate. This was echoed by local residents who came to see me. They were pleasantly shocked by what they felt was the low rate I'd scored. For my visitors, parking was an expensive challenge as it would be at any downtown hotel anywhere. However, bus service and the trolley are only one and two blocks away respectively. The transit system's store where one can buy passes and get maps is also steps away from the hotel which is another great advantage.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Laurel, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cVery Clean property for a wedding block\u201d", "Author": "robwat23", "ReviewID": "UR117989435", "Content": "We are having a destination wedding in San Diego and stayed at this Westin with the possibility of having our out of town wedding guests stay at this hotel.

I normally keep mine on 74 but we had it down on 62 and it did not feel cool enough. Bathrooms were pretty spacious for a hotel in its class, and came with a plush bathrobe and plenty of nice plush towels. Toiletries were of high quality. The pool area is nothing to write home about (it is heated but small). They do have towel service at the pool. Workout area is very nice for a hotel in its class, has everything you'd need for a decent workout. The rooms were in very good condition although I thought the decorating was on the cheap - there were only two pieces of (ugly) artwork and one had a wonky frame. The carpet was in great condition. Toiletries smelled good, no need to bring your own soap and shampoo. Hotel lobby is very nice and has a beautiful staircase, there is also free WI-FI in the lobby.

When booking this hotel in San Diego i as always went thru the Starwood reservsations dept. After completing the booking i google the hotel and was surprised by some of the negative reviews i read on this very paged trip advisor. I must say that i have nothing by praise for the hotel and staff. It met my expectations and actually surpassed it.

The food was great but the service was truly amazing, the server who waited on us the most was Michele E. Each time we came in she had a big smile to greet us, sat u right away, got our food and drinks fast and we never had to wait. But most importantly it was the conversation.

I stayed 2x back to back weeks in April - first visit, Matt at the front desk set the pace with a great check-in (friendly, professional and follow-through on items I requested for my room), The restaurant service was not so up to par w/attitude and professionalism and they messed up my check which I did not learn of until I checked out. When I shared my issues w/the front desk they immediately asked what they could do to resolve/make my stay more complete and did it. The second week/visit, not so great - Matt was again helpful eventhough he was not checking us in - he rememebered us and made sure we rec'd our items in the room again. This time the issue was the wake-up call came an hour early and when I told them this and asked them to call back at thr right time, the call never came and I missed my meeting start. Second, the restaurant again messed up my check which I learned about at check-out again. Third, when I checked out around 12:15 (which check-out time for all hotels, there was only 1 person at the front desk with a lot of people waiting around to be helped. Lastly, when I checked out and was asked again how my stay was and I relayed the above- the gentleman just kept asking me if I knew who the person (name, man or woman, etc) was that messed up my wake up call (it was 545a I didn't ask for a name) - not the point! And he did nothing to mitigate the inconsistent service. Hotel's facility, room and location are superior.

The concierge was very knowledgeable; she took the time to help me map out my points of interests. Once I returned she asked about my sightseeing and if I was able to find everything. Later that evening I asked her where I could get a pizza for dinner and she made one phone call to a local pizza restaurant, asked for the manager and advised that guests from the Westin would be coming. She then handed me the restaurants card, which was an offer for free pizza. Even though, it was just a pizza place the service provided by the concierge made me feel like I was going to a fine dining establishment.

This is an absurd amount considering I get internet at home for $9.95 a month!! I will never stay at this Westin again, there is no justification for the 20% surcharge on room service, and the internet prices ? Common Westin, 99% of hotels these days offer free internet! And at the price I was paying for my room? Just not worth it. I can stay at a Super 8 where there's a free breakfast, free internet, and free parking for 1/2 the cost of the Westin, and its just as clean and the service is great! And talk about my bill? They double charged me 14.95 in the same day for internet. Thought it was only 9.95 Westin. The fact that you can so clearly take advantage of your guests is beyond me.
