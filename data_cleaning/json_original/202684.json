We booked two rooms, one for my wife and i, and one for our son and his girlfriend. We chose the Papadopoli due to its location , right next to Piazzale Roma which is both the bus and Vaporetti terminus. As we had an early flight home, the hotel proved great in that respect in that you are literally two minutes away from the airport bus stop. The hotel foyer has a classy feel to it and the dining room ( we stayed B &B) was superb, all marble, chandeliers etc. The choice of food for the buffet style breakfast was fine. Our room was situated on the top floor with a narrow balcony that commanded superb views over the roof tops and the church opposite. Surprisingly, the shower was an over the bath type which was slightly disappointing, but on reflection this is the best they could do given the size of the rooms. The corridors and overall decor away from the lobby / dining room were in need of a bit of TLC but overall not too bad. Now for the bad experience. Around midnight, after an alarm had intermittently been going off in our sons room, with no-one answering the phone and unable to get to sleep, they went downstairs to see what could be done. Apparently, the night concierge was quite surly but eventually they got a different room for the night. Despite assurances that the problem would be fixed, it wasn't straight away and further complaints had to be made. Not good enough ! Couple this to the extortionate bar prices (this might be the same in all hotels in Venice ?), and we left feeling slightly disappointed. I had stayed in Venice 3 years earlier, again for the carnival in a hotel just behind San Marco, and as such i have to compare like for like. For convenience its hard to beat, for the rest i'm not too sure.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London UK", "Title": "\u201cCan't be faulted\u201d", "Author": "Magyarmike", "ReviewID": "UR128301248", "Content": "This hotel and their wonderful, helpful staff made our 3 night stay perfect for my first visit to Venice. Others have already mentioned the very convenient location by the central bus station and the main vaporetto dock, but what stands out most was the outstanding, friendly team of staff who go out of their way to be helpful at every opportunity. We had a very nicely decorated room on the 4th floor with a view of the bridge over the canal. The beds were extremely comfortable and the bathroom included an decent sized bath (with overhead shower as well). This was a real luxury for a soak after a long day sightseeing. Bathrobes and slippers were supplied and a complementary bottle of water and nicely wrapped box of local biscuits were waiting for us on the first day. We did not experience any problems with any street noise at any time. Breakfast was a good selection of hot and cold dishes from the buffet and a chef was on hand to prepare egg dishes to order. As our friends were not feeling very well we decided to have dinner in the lovely hotel restaurant. There was a set 3 course menu @ 35 Euros as well a small a la carte list which was pretty good value for a 4 star hotel in Venice. Our bottle of wine was particularly reasonable @ 20 euros. There is a very comfortable bar to the left of the main entrance with the feel of a private room in a country house. Drinks are served with a variety of snacks. I'd like to give a special mention to David, who I believe is the maitre'd. He was very helpful when we asked to move tables on the night we ate at the hotel. It was handled quickly and tactfully. I would not hesitate to reccomend this hotel and if we ever return to Venice this will be our first choice.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester", "Title": "\u201cPure Quality\u201d", "Author": "Ningram", "ReviewID": "UR128183967", "Content": "After reviewing this hotel on Trip Adviser, I booked a 5 night stay as a surprise for my partner's 60th birthday.

In twenty five minutes for just 3.50 Euros you can be leaving Arrivals and be at Hotel reception. Your first impressions are of a very typical venetian hotel facing straight onto a small canal. At Reception you will receive a friendly greeting before taking either of two rather small but reliable lifts to your floor. The rooms are comfortable and well equiped with flat screen TVs with a wide selection of chanels (several in English) and coffee and tea making facilities. Beds are extremely comfortable and bathrooms provide all the usual facilities, all in good working order. While the rooms are very clean, most rooms have two small balconies which could do with some regular attention including rennovation and regular cleaning. The location of the hotel is in the north of the Island of Venice just accross the Grand Canale from both the railway station (Ferrovia) and the Ferrovia vaporetto berths with waterbusses around the main island, down the Grand Canale to the Rialto Bridge and beyond down to Academia and Saint Mark's Square (take numbers 1 and 2). A Number 3 waterbus from Ferrovia will take you directly to the Island of Murano. For those who want to explore Venice by foot, make sure you have an excellent map but you can reach the Rialto and Saint Mark's Square within 30 minutes. It is 10 minutes by boat. The hotel restaurant gives the impression of being within a garden with vines growing up the walls and overhead. An excellent breakfast buffet is served each morning offering the usual selection of eggs, cheeses, salamis, fruit, pastries complemented by a chef providing omelettes,etc to order. The only danger with the buffet is that your diet will be completely ruined before you go out the door. While the Restaurant provides an excellent breakfast, evening meals are hit and miss. My wife and I have stayed twice in the Papadopoli and dined in the restaurant both times and both times we have have good and not so good experiences. I would advise walking some 300 metres to the Ristorante Ribot where you will be greeted as if members of the family and you will enjoy an excellent relaxed meal for 20 to 30 Euros plus wine. We have no hesitation in selecting Papadopoli for a friendly, comfortable, romantic stay in Venice.", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA great location and a great hotel\u201d", "Author": "David M", "ReviewID": "UR127360072", "Content": "A fine location - the hotel is a short walk from the railway station and a shorter one from the Piazzole Roma with its vaporetto stop.

The reception was welcoming and the room had everything we wanted, including a mini-balcony overlooking the Papadopoli gardens. Slightly cramped, perhaps - but this is Venice.

Take a compass so you can at least get your directions, the path you take is not important, just the general direction and every trip will be a wonderful discovery. 2. In our experience food in venice is generally not great, you have to search it out and the best will be expensive. We only ate Breakfast in the Hotel and it was good, not memorable 3. Dont be afraid to try the bright orange drinks you see everywhere at Sunset, called Aperol Spritz and an essential and highly addictive part of the Venician Experience. 4. May was a brilliant time to travel. November an apparent disaster due to tides 5. Pay for a gondola in the smaller canals and chose someone with personality and who can sing you wont forget that experience. We almost auditioned 4 guys and found a gem!

When I called front desk to ask if we can get rain boots the woman offered us to borrow rain boots for the two of us - such a nice gesture so we don't have to run around trying to buy them in a unfamiliar city, I would like to thank her for that - her name was Caterina - thank you! ( sorry if I misspelled the name) The bed was the best out of the three hotels we stayed in this trip. The linens feel high-thread count cotton - very pleasant. The hotel provides all the pillows and blankets you may want plus the bath ropes, slippers, etc, etc - very nice. The breakfast was good. Overall it feels that this hotel knows that t may be on the older side but they are trying very hard to compensate for it with excellent service, good linens, - small things but very helpful. Oh - this was the only hotel that provided electric kettle in the room so we can make tea and coffee in the room - thank you for small miracles! Don't know if the fire code in Venice is different from other places but this was very welcome, The location is 5 minutes walk to Pl. De Roma vaporetto station. We took a bunch of side trips to Venetian lagune - Murano island, Burano island - this location was great to catch the vaporetto and go whenever we wanted. Vaporetto is a water bus that takes you around Venice. Also when it was sadly time for us to leave Venice we walked 5 minutes to Pl.

From the hotel, it is also easy to access the water bus to get to St. Marks Square and Lido. It is also a pleasant walk to St. Margherita Square, which was a delightful array of restaurants and bars.

All in all a very charming hotel that will undoubtedly be our choice for the next visits to one of the most beautiful cities in the world.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bologna, Italy", "Title": "\u201cparfect staying\u201d", "Author": "CHICCA58", "ReviewID": "UR92152119", "Content": "Me and my husband decided to see Venice during the past Christmas Holidays to catch the different and magic atmosphere of Venice in December.

All I had to do to take pictures as beautiful as these was to look out from the window. The lobby is big and very elegant, with a wonderful bar where to taste spritz and other special drinks. But the rooms are so beautiful, in a romantic, classic style, perfect in every details, with a modern and very confortable bathroom, very well equipped. And if you open the curtains you have onother very good extra....the view. The breakfast room is very unusual, a huge window on the Giardini Papadopoli, a full immersion in the nature, and the gourmet buffet is very rich and can satisfy any customer. From the hotel you can easily walk to reach the Piazza San Marco, or stop in the nice rastaurant that you can find on the way, like the Osteria Ai Vini Da Gigio, near the Ca' D'oro, that we enjoyed so much. So a high quality hotel with a smart price for a perfect staying in Venice, one of the most beautiful city in the world!

The main railway station is also nearby (short walking distance).

The hotel staff was very helpful in recommending nice places to eat and providing directions to popular destinations across the city and transportation information for the railway station en route to our next Italian city destination. Only relatively minor issue during our stay was the elevators were not working during a portion of our visit which was not very convenient (our room was located on the top floor).

To see what Murano is supposed to be, head down the main drag and over a bridge where fewer tourists tread. Have a sandwich at the deli and hit a couple of glass stores where prices are better. Beware of the crappier places selling glass made in \"Italy\" but not Murano. It is cheaper but probably machine-made. Then double-back part way for the boat to Burano and Torcello.

The concierge who was on duty on the evening of July 13 was truly very helpful on the AC issue, and on recommeding things to us and what to watch out for (even telling us not to take the free ride to Murano as you would have to make your own way back). The breakfast room was very nice and the food very good. The most important thing about this hotel, in my mind, was its location. Just across the canal from the train station and bus station, which made getting to it fairly easy. Also good to be able to connect with water buses (vaporators) and airport bus to Marco Polo.

As previously mentioned by another writer it's easier to use the water taxis to get to this hotel from the airport. Although if cash is short its a rather expensive way to get there, we paid roughly 80 Euro. Our rooms was a good size with a large bathroom, although as other writers have previously mentioned nothing fantastic for price of Euro 220.00 per night. Secondly the location is good for walking to all the restaurant options available nearby. For those of us from the other side of the pond, please note there is a small restaurant nearby which serves a good English breakfast for around 8 Euro. We found it on the second day of our stay after walking around looking for somewhere which did not serve strong coffee and rolls. I guess when in Italy you have to experience the culture therefore you cannot expect to receive pancakes, bacon, sausage or eggs. But considering the majority of the tourists I encountered were either American or from UK. Most of these restaurants could have had other options. Oh well this why you travel to experience other ways of life. Lastly we never used the hotel restaurant but my husband used the bar facilities and was not impressed at the cost of around 8 euro for a beer. Please note we are from Bermuda and we are used to hotels charging higher other establishments. But beer in a hotel in Bermuda does not cost $ 12.80. Another thing we noticed is that a lot of restaurants charge 2 euor for bread and 2 euro fee to eat in their restaurants, go figure.

Check-in: had to wait ages as only one person on duty who was having to deal with a very difficult/complicated group (however - he very pleasant when I eventually got to the desk) Lifts: if you suffer from claustrophobia - find the stairs! They are tiny, hot, and slow. Rooms: bed was brilliantly comfortable and I had a lovely balcony on the 5th floor which meant that I had lovely views across the rooftops. Air-conditioning was basic. Bathroom was a disappointment - cracked tiles and the grouting needed a good clean. The rooms were smaller than I had anticipated. Breakfast: OK - not brilliant. The coffee was truly disgusting and I'm sure they use UHT milk. Ugh! Felt as though I was eating in a jungle clearing. Bar: I gave up on trying to get any service one evening as it was deserted. On the other two evenings I felt as though we were inconveniencing the staff by wanting a drink! Having said all this - the fact that the hotel wasn't quite to standard didn't detract from our visit to Venice which we thoroughly enjoyed.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Concord, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cA classy, old-world hotel\u201d", "Author": "mbkmwj", "ReviewID": "UR36846920", "Content": "We booked a room for ourselves and an adjoining one for the kids on the fourth floor.

We travelled to Treviso Airport from Dublin and got the ATVO (Ryanair) bus into Venice (Cost \u00e2\u201a\u00ac10.00 each return- Great value). Tickets are available in the airport terminal, buy your ticket and validate in either the machine beside the ticket office or on the bus then you're away! Tell the driver that you want to go to Piazzale Roma then enjoy the journey to town We arrived on a Sunday morning and the journey took 30 minutes but the return in rush hour traffic took exactly 1 hour. When you arrive at Piazzale Roma you have practically arrived at the hotel, from the bus to the front door takes 2 minutes walk crossing one canal bridge then passing the small Papadopoli garden and entering the hotel from the canal side. We arrived early and our room was not available but the concierge took our bags leaving us free to wander and get our first tastes of Venice. The reception area is quite small but staff are helpfull. Also the hotel has a small bar and a separate restaurante. We didn't eat at the hotel but we tried a drink in the bar on one night and found a nice atmosphere though pretty quiet. There are two lifts at this hotel but they are very small, they work fine though. Our room was a twin room because there were no doubles left, we also upgraded to a canal view room which we enjoyed. The decor was stylishly old and the room contained what appeared to be antique furniture in the form of mirrors and tables. The twin beds were comfortableand there were extra pillows and blankets in the wardrobe. The bathroom was well stocked and a mini bar in the room. There was a safe and air conditioning also but we chose to leave the window open to take in the gentle canal noise coming from below as well as listening to the general evening and night chatter and the bird song. At the front of the hotel there is a jetty and the reception staff are happy to phone for a water taxi who will pick you up from here, pretty cool I must say! The Santa Croce area where this hotel is located suited us perfectly because it's a nice quiet area and a pleasent place to return to after visting the bustling San Marco Square, Rialto Bridge areas. the Grand Canal is less than three minutes walk from the hotel and about five minutes walk from the closest water bus stop. The water busses are busy and quite full but is a fantastic way to see the city and the surrounding islands. My favoiurite bus line is the number 2 bus which gives a good broad view of all the main attractions of this magnificent city as well as sharing with the locals one of the nicest ways to commute anywhere. We were plesantly surprised with the prices in Venice haveing been scared out of our wits with stories our excessively expensive shopping. We come from Dublin so with this in mind we are used to relatively high prices but I'm sure that because of the strength of the Euro that people from the UK and the USA could feel a little sting, but I would still recommend this city and Sofitel Venice hotel.

Overall our stay at the hotel was a positive one, and I would recommend it to others, however there were a few things could use improvement, and I will try and be as objective as possible. We chose the Sofitel for two reasons, one the location, and two because we wanted an upscale \"modern\" hotel with comfortable beds and air-conditioning. We had an early flight (6am) when leaving Venice, and wanted easy access to Piazalle Roma so that we could take a land taxi to the Airport. We were VERY happy with this decision, not only for our early morning departure, but for our arrival as well. It is situated on a lovely smaller canal, a short walk (less than 5 min) away from the main foot bridge that connects Venice to the mainland at Piazalle Roma. The airport can be accessed by land taxi from here for a reasonable fare of aprox 35 euros, as opposed to over 100 euro each way for a water taxi. If arriving by train or car, you will arrive at Piazalle Roma as this is \"the end of the road\" so to speak. I can not stress enough how convenient this is. In my opinion the location is IDEAL. When arriving in Venice with luggage, you really only have two options, walk, or take a water taxi/vaporetto to your hotel. It is VERY difficult to carry luggage in Venice. You constantly have to lug it up and down stairs to cross bridges over canals. The streets are narrow and crowded, and it is very HOT in the summer months. During our stay we constantly encountered tourists who were lost (as getting around Venice can be a bit confusing), wandering through the streets with their bags, seemingly on the verge of collapse. This would always make us thankful for our choice of hotel location. We found that staying away from the craziness of St Marks Square very nice. It was about a 20-25 min walk, or you could catch the vaporetto. Venice is a tourist city, it is safe and enjoyable to walk even at night. There are many shops and restaurants along the way. We were told, if you get lost, don't worry you are on an island! Just follow the signs to Piazalle Roma, or St Marks Square and you will be fine. We chose the Sofitel because we had read horror stories about hotels in Venice. They are all small, some dirty and run down, many with no air conditioning. Our thinking was that we could trust the well known French hotel chain. I made our reservations on the Accor Hotels web site, but actually e-mailed the hotel directly a few times with questions, and my e-mail was always promptly and friendly replied to. Since it was our 10th wedding anniversary, and we were travelling with our 9 year old son, we decided to reserve a Junior Suite. I also decided to reserve the \"dream maker package\" because it included tickets to the Peggy Guggenheim museum , a bottle of Champagne on arrival, one dinner for 2 people, a welcome drink at Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Bar and a 1 hour trip by private boat. (We were particularly looking forward to the 1 hr boat ride) The package added aprox 200 euro to the price of the room (for the two night stay), but we thought that considering the price of a nice dinner for two in Venice, and the cost of a private boat ride, along with the other perks, it would be worth it. (We were wrong) Check in was a pleasant experience. The lobby is small but elegant. A live harpist plays music in the evenings, which we found a very nice touch. The front desk staff was friendly, and we were shown to our room which was ready when we arrived. The junior suite was on one of the top floors, overlooking the front of the hotel, right on the canal. The view was beautiful. It was our first time in Venice and being able to look out and see the gondolas was very romantic. The room was small for North American Standards. The Junior suite was only slightly larger than a \"normal\" hotel room in Canada, however it was spacious enough for the three of us and very nicely furnished. There was a king bed, with very comfortable mattress and bedding, and a cot was set up for our son. The room also had a sitting area with sofa, chairs, an antique wooden writing desk and furniture. The bathroom was modern and nice, the shower drain was a little slow, but this did not really cause any problem, and the door latch was hanging loose with a missing screw, but the room for the most part was in excellent condition. We did have to leave the air-conditioner on high the whole time, and the temperature never got cold, however it did cool the room to a reasonable level where we felt comfortable, considering it was VERY hot outside. Other guests have commented on an odd smell in the hotel. There did seem to be a smell in the hall, that we could not identify, however we could not smell anything in the room. One other thing to note was the incredibly small elevators. It was actually comical, and never really caused any problems, but getting more than four adults on at one time would be difficult without a shoe horn! Breakfast was included and served in the beautiful Winter Garden restaurant. It was quite average, not really noteworthy in any fashion, certainly not the best buffet we experienced on our European vacation, but not the worst either. Our dinner (included in the rate) was very nice as well, however we were the only guests in the restaurant. It was amusing to watch the male wait staff flirting with the attractive female harpist for most of our meal, as they really had nothing else to keep them busy. The meal was good, but we probably would have dined elsewhere had it not been pre-paid. The real disappointment was with the boat ride. We had seen the beautiful boat the hotel owns and were looking forward to going for a ride in it. As a matter of fact we had decided not to take a gondola ride because of this. When I went to the concierge to arrange the boat ride, I was told that it was not included in my rate. I told him that it was included, and he then agreed to give us a free \"taxi\" ride to St Marks Square. I think that he still not believe me, and was offering this as a \"favour\". I declined and instead returned to my room to get the print out of the confirmation stating we were entitled to a one hour private boat tour. Upon returning, he took a photocopy, and somewhat reluctantly booked our boat trip for the following morning. He was also at the same time constantly trying to talk us into taking a \"free\" boat trip to Murano, which we continually declined after reading about how high pressure these free trips could become. We met in the lobby the following morning, and he escorted us to the boat. He said a few words to the driver, who we don't think spoke any English, and then turned to us and said \"your driver will drive you around for 1 hr and drop you off at the hotel or St Marks Square, but we don't have a licence to drive in the Grand Canal, so we will have to go around\". We were then driven out into the industrial basin, past condemned buildings, sewage, and piles of scrap steel. We were taken out into the ocean, through the port, and eventually dropped off at St Marks Square. The driver did not speak a single word the entire hour we were afloat. We had expected at the very least a nice romantic, scenic tour through Venice on it's canals. Had even hoped for some sort of a guided tour, with points of interest being shown along the way. We are not sure if this was revenge for insisting on getting our trip, or if they really couldn't drive in the city (plenty of other boats certainly do), either way this was not at all what we had expected and were VERY disappointed. The other minor problem was on check out when our included dinner was charged to the bill. This was removed when pointed out. This seemed to be a recurring theme throughout Italy. The Italians love to smile and charge you for things you shouldn't have to pay for...LOL. All in all, we loved Venice, and were pleased with our choice of hotel. The junior suite was very nice and the view was great. I would recommend booking a junior suite, however do not book the dream maker package as the perks are clearly not worth the extra. The staff didn't really out perform, however they were friendly and efficient. Possibly not the Flagship of the Sofitel chain, but a very comfortable modern hotel, and especially in Venice this can be hard to find. I would recommend the Sofitel for anyone looking for an upscale hotel in a convenient location.", "Date": "August 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cA disappointment\u201d", "Author": "Aude", "ReviewID": "UR5614809", "Content": "We had high hopes for our stay at the Sofitel Venezia because we generally love this chain.

Adding to the yuck factor was the condition of our small balcony: Its floor held a couple of inches of dirty water. The size of the room itself was decent, and the bathroom was nice. The public areas were lovely. However, for the price we paid we expected much nicer accommodations. I would not even consider staying there again. And I'm not very picky! A note to those of you who plan to book this hotel: The Sofitel is accessible by land, as it is right next to the Piazalle Roma.

But for the triple, the price was around 225 Euro (incl. breakfast too). Getting to this hotel is easy, from the St. Lucia station, just cross the bridge on the left (yes it's heavy with luggages) then turn right and go all the way until you cross the bridge. After that you'll meet a bridge again, but don't cross this time. Just take left and go for a few walks until you see a garden with gates and a huge Sofitel Venezia sign. If you don't like walking you can take the water taxi and stop at the Piazzale Roma. From there it's really easy to locate the hotel. The receptionist was quite friendly. We were given rooms on the first floor (lifts are SO SMALL only fits 5 people w/o luggages). The rooms are really antique and beautifully decorated. We had 2 rooms, one triple and one double. The triple one had no view at all. You open the window and get to see the glass roof of the Papadopoli restaurant, so if you wake up in the morning and open the window you can actually see people eating down there. But the double's view was really great! It face this little street with a lot of passers by. The beds are really great. The triple room had 3 beds, one of them is a set-up bed but have the same comfort as the other two. Everything was so beautiful in the rooms (Decorated in 18th century Venetian). The triple was larger than the double. The bathrooms are really nice, and they provide you with towels, bathrobes, etc. Breakfast was really good in the 'Winter Garden', a really beautiful place. Try to wake up earlier if the hotel's quite full since the place wasn't too big. The breakfast service was absolutely great and they would serve you anything with smiles!

The buffet provides enough choice to ensure there is something to suit everyone. All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful and last, but definitely not least, the location is a real gem. It's only a few minutes walk to the train station, the stop for the bus to the airport and the stops for a number of waterbus services. That said, it is 40 minute waterbus trip away from St Mark's square. However, the Sofitel more than matches many of the more expensive hotels nearer St Mark's plus the no 1 waterbus route, which is two minutes walk from the Sofitel, takes you to St Mark's via many of the main sights along the Grand Canal so we didn't see the journey as a problem.", "Date": "April 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot quite usual Sofitel Standards\u201d", "Author": "dogsareforlife", "ReviewID": "UR4984394", "Content": "We recently spent 3 nights at the Sofitel Venice. We booked a deluxe room (via the Sofitel website) at EU287 per night. We chose the hotel based on its location and the fact that I like Sofitel hotels - they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re generally a very good standard (New York and Washington being exceptional) and I also belong to the Sofitel loyalty scheme which tends to influence my decisions on where to stay. The hotel is easy to find being just yards from the Piazzale Roma - fairly easy to manage even with suitcases. It sits near the Campo Tolentini, facing a small canal. Although the walkway past the hotel bridge is busy, the hotel was very quiet. The reception area is very grand with an enormous Venetian glass chandelier in the middle of the main area. To the left of the entrance is a lovely bar/library area for people watching, directly in front is the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Winter Garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where breakfast is served and to the right, a small reception/concierge area. Check in was just OK. Not very welcoming and not much eye contact made. We tried our (little) Italian but were answered in English. Finding a room seemed to take some time but eventually we were given room 525 which was on the top floor. The concierge insisted on taking us to our room to show us the features. The elevators in this hotel (2 of them) are TINY - just about enough room for 3 people and two medium suitcases! But only just. The room was small but had access to a balcony which surrounded it and gave stunning views of the church opposite and the roof tops of Venice. There were several windows in the room and the breeze from being high up was welcoming. Bed was great - the usual Sofitel bedding which is extremely comfortable. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t much room to walk around but there was a built in wardrobe, dressing table and several other tables and a chair. The TV was on top of the well stocked but pricy mini-bar. Internet access was available in room if required but I cannot remember the tariff. No in-room coffee or tea making facilities (or Ice for that matter) was a disappointment. The bathroom as a big disappointment! Again, small but very scruffy with mouldy grout and cracked tiles which had been badly patched up. It was cleaned well each day and the towels replenished but I expected much more from a Sofitel. The water pressure was inconsistent as was the heat of the water. The bedroom too was scruffy with cracked plastic skirting boards and a carpet that really needed replacing. The colour theme was dated (soft greens and peaches) - very \u00e2\u20ac\u015380s\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Good job we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t spend much time in it as it would have begun to feel claustrophobic very quickly. Breakfast each morning was a large continental buffet selection with very pleasant waiters and waitresses bringing coffee and tea. You could also request eggs, omelettes and other items in addition to the buffet. Breakfast in your room could be served but this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t included in the room rate and they charged EU6 for each item over and above a very basic menu. The setting for the breakfast was lovely - the so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153winter garden\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which overlooks the reception and canal. It is a glass room covered with vines which gives the impression of dining al fresco! It was a great way to start each day and had a very relaxed atmosphere. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use the concierge as we tend to be independent travellers. Neither did we dine at the hotel in the evening, preferring to try several restaurants closer to St Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square - mostly for the atmosphere in the evenings - its fun to people watch as you eat. The Venice 72hr Blue Card was excellent value at EU68 for two (about \u00c2\u00a348 or $60). This pass gave us unlimited use of the Vaporettos including trips to islands (it includes the Lido too but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get there). It also allowed you to use the public washrooms for free. It was extremely convenient to have the pass instead of getting a new ticket for each trip but the card is very flimsy and easily damaged. It comes with a great map in a plastic wallet. Get your pass at the airport (just turn left at arrivals and pass the long queues for the bus tickets) the booth is on the right. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take long to walk to the Rialto and then on to San Marco. There are several routes you could take and we tried them all. The Vaporetto stops at Piazza Roma and the Train Station (Ferrovia) are a couple of minutes walk from the hotel. If you like to explore on foot, this hotel is an excellent location. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like too much waking you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll need to stay closer to San Marco. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d choose this hotel again until it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s had a re-fit. The public areas are lovely but the room was tired and needed money spending on it. At about \u00c2\u00a3550 for 3 nights B&B in Venice it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad value - but neither was it brilliant value.
