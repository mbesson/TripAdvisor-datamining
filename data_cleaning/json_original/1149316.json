I had my shower done around 8:30am and guessed other customers used all they had. Breakfast was below average compares with other places we stayed in the same trip in Rome. Coffee taste like something from dollar stores here in US. \"Aged\" fresh fruits were served. You can see small flies around the breakfast area, they were probably from the \"darken\" bananas. I had diarrhea that day, not saying it was from the breakfast but probably a candidate. Also Just downstair at the corner of via Cadore and via Via Ludovisi there are two bars/restaurants. If you stay there over Friday/Sat nights, be aware they have loud music and customers all past midnight. To aware there are steps to use their elevator up or down stairs.

The place is perfectly OK. On the plus side the building is impressive and the staff are very pleasant. The residence (for that is what it is) is scrupulously clean, the beds are quite comfortable and the room we stayed in initially (one of 6) was quiet despite overlooking Via Ludovisi. We were required to move to another room on our third night as our room had been requested by other guests. This was explained to us on the basis that 206 was a superior room to which we had been upgraded at no extra cost, and on the third night we would be moved back to a classic room (202). There was in fact very little difference between the rooms, 206 being slightly bigger, but I suspect the reality of the situation was that the new guests had read reviews on trip advisor saying that 202 was noisy and didn't want to stay there! It was a bit noisier being near the reception desk and we were woken early by an alarm clock and footsteps in the room above, but it wasn't so bad. On the down side, I cannot really understand the glowing reviews this place has received. I perhaps expected too much from the 4 star rating. The decor is, to me, dated and bland. The shower cubicle (in rooms 206 and 202 at least) was extremely small. My very tall husband couldn't really reach his feet! Stick to tea at breakfast as the black coffee is instant and the cappuccino from a machine - a bit disappointing in the barista capital of the world! The lovely Italian lady on the desk in the evening, who didn't speak English, was unable to suggest where we might be able to get a good pizza, which you might have expected, though she did at least tell us about an area where many restaurants could be found. I would think the proprietor himself might have been more help in this regard but he was off duty all weekend. In short, whilst the Beau Site was basically fine it in no way enhanced our stay in Rome. If you are looking for just a clean quiet bed, great, but if you want somewhere with a little quirkiness and romance, this definitely isn't the place for you.", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belfast, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSuperb hotel\u201d", "Author": "GordyNic", "ReviewID": "UR78257752", "Content": "This place is a little gem!

It is on the second story of a business/residence building that is under some renovation. It has the feel of staying in someone's home. That is both good and bad. The Beau Site has finished its' beautiful renovation, but there is still some minor noise from the restoration of other parts of the building. Hammering can be heard weekdays during the day but is generally not a problem. The interior is nicely decorated, carpeted, clean, has satellite television with multiple language access, internet connections via your laptop (in the rooms only), and new marbled bathrooms. The location is superb in that it is near to Villa Borghese and the Spanish Steps, yet away from much of the noise that permeates life in Rome. Still, there is a restaurant on the street that generates some noise that can be heard through the windows. More irritating is the telephone calls and entry ringer (there is a door buzzer you must use to gain access from the street to the building and hotel) that occur at the front desk and echo through the main hall into the rooms. The busier the hotel and the more people come and go, the more you hear the buzzer and telephone. It was not that busy when we were there, but the noise sure was noticeable. We stayed in room 201, which is closest to the front desk, so we may have been more impacted. There is also some room to room noise. We heard voices a little to distinctly, the television from the next room, and the teenage girls chatting until 2 am. Note to the owner: \"Bigfoot\" lives above room 201 and when he \"walks\" around his apt/condo, the light fixture on the ceiling of 201actually rattles. It might be a good idea to try to secure the fixture to preserve some sleep for the guests (and maybe send some cushy slippers to \"Bigfoot\"). Most disappointing was the breakfast. We expect quite a bit more for $25 per person. Service is poor, as the owners or their one helper eventually get around to serving coffee or cleaning a table. They need to be more proactive. Hot food is an extra cost and is not worth it. Avoid the omelets. The breakfast buffet consisted of elderly corn flakes/choco puffs, 2 juices, milk, leftover rolls, packaged \"sweet\" rolls, yogurt, and an occasional croissant. Totally inadequate. You can get bacon, eggs, coffee and bread for 10 euros down the street. Not that I expect bacon and eggs with the buffet, but some fresh fruit, a protein, granola, cheeses, meats, fresh jams and croissants would greatly improve the spread. Our hotel in Barcelona (Villa Emilia) the week before had all of these things and more for the same money, including homemade marmalade, prosciutto, ham, hard boiled eggs, fresh cream filled and chocolate pastries, multiple cheeses, cappuccinos, and Cava sparkling wine. Until there is a change in the offerings, have breakfast elsewhere. Because the owners don't speak English, and our rudimentary Italian was inadequate, we were unable to communicate very well. The lone English speaker on the staff was rarely there, especially when we needed them. The owners seem to be very nice people, and have a lovely place that is full of potential, but need to address the noise and breakfast issues before we can recommend Beau Site to others.", "Date": "March 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "SusanNY3312", "Title": "\u201cLike staying with family in their beautiful home\u201d", "Author": "SusanNY3312", "ReviewID": "UR55882495", "Content": "I stayed at the Beau Site with my 2 teenage sons and my parents from Dec 26th 2009 thru Jan. 2nd 2010.

Situated just 5-8 mins walk from either Spagna or Barberini Metro station, it is in an idea location for easy reach from the main airport of Rome. The hotel is actually a Bouteque, and is loacted within an apartments / Office block that is on the second floor. The owner converted this with a total renovation to a high standard after managing other hotels for many years, deciding to buy and run his own a year ago. Luigi the owner welcomed us personally upon our arrival. He kindly carried out heavy case up the stairs to the second floor. Yes as previous reviews mention, there is some restoration works on going in the building reception area and the stairwells, but this is limited to this area only, and did not bother us in any way. From what we have seen, the finished work so far, will highly complement the rest of the building once finished. But please do not let this put you off a stay at this hotel, it is the stairwell not the hotel or rooms being renovated. Once we got to the hotels reception Luigi kindly upgraded us to there master room which was a complete surprise, of which he kindly showed us round including showing us the standard rooms so as to compare with the Master room. The Standard rooms are to as the same high standard as the master, however slightly smaller in size. He then also brought us homemade cakes was a lovely touch. All parts of the hotel were spotlessly clean with no fault with any part. The rooms come with a quite type fridge, and a digital room safe large enough for a laptop. Also a 40+inch plasma and Sky TV. All rooms and areas of the hotel being finished to a high standard decor. Luigi and his family cant be any more helpful than they were during our stay. He would provide us with maps and recommendations for places to visit, right down to informing us if we were wearing the correct clothing to visit certain sites in Rome. Breakfast was a Buffy type, with fresh bread rolls, and freshly made pastry's, Cereals and yogurts.

The online booking did not allow us to book the same room type for the duration of our stay. On arrival, late in the afternoon, we were met and warmly welcomed by Luigi the Hotel proprietor. He immediately offered us an upgrade from the double superior to the junior suite at a reduced rate. This was just the beginning of an outstanding experience. Our room, just like the hotel was nicely scented and was fitted to the highest standard. Elegant furniture with tasteful touches. A real plant that was changed a few days later to a Christmas Poinsettia. A 42 inch plasma TV with it\u2019s own satellite tuner that receives pay as well free to air channels from all over the world. The bathroom, just like the room, was very clean and fitted to the highest standard. Sheets and towels were changed daily. A bathrobe and slippers completed the 5 star treatment. The breakfast buffet that we saw on the site photos turned out to be completely misleading. Far from being meager, it was complemented by freshly baked pies and cakes prepared by Luigi\u2019s wife, Rita. This is when you start feeling at home. Luigi and Rita go out of their way to make you feel welcomed. Coffee is prepared fresh to your taste, complementary dishes of cheese and cold cuts appeared on regular bases to help you sample Italian specialties. Both Luigi and Rita were always forthcoming with information and advice about Rome, the attractions and the shopping. Just to complete the package, Beau Site is central to several great attractions such as the Spanish Steps and Fontana del Tritone. It is close to both Spagna and Barberini Metro stations. And if you are there for the shopping, it is a few minutes walk from the prestigious Via Condotti where all the designer shops are and many smaller boutiques.
