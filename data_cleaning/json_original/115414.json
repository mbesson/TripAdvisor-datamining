We stayed there when they opened and it was brand new. We had not stayed in the Sevilla inn in 8 years. Since then, The German couple that owned it and operated it sold it and no longer are there. We stayed for two nights. The Good - The price was excellent. We paid 39.00 per night. The beds were confortable, The linens were clean, The room was clean and most importantly there were no bugs or roaches at all. The A/C worked very well. The Bad and the Ugly - The sink and tub did not drain properly so there was standing water in the tub when we showered. On the exterior of the hotel, it seems a bit run down, The lawn and gardens were unkept, in the hall ways there some lights that were out and the ice machine was broken. When the German couple owned it, the place was impeccable in its appearance. We were given a room that looked remodelled and updated. I do not know if all the rooms have been remodelled and updated. It was on the second floor on top of the office very close to the main road. At night there was alot of traffic noise. There is a strip malll next to the hotel. In the strip mall there was a Dominican night club. On Saturday night there was loud music till the wee hours of the night. We travel with ear plugs so the noise really did not bother us. If you are travelling with kids or do not travel with ear plugs you may want to request a room on the opposite side of the hotel facing away from the strip mall. You may also want to request a room in the back of the hotel due to the traffic noise we experienced so close to the main road. In conclusion, If you are looking for a Cheap and Clean place to sleep that has no bugs this is a good option. Be realistic in your expectation, Do not expect the Hilton or the Ritz for 39.00 a night. Hope this helps", "Date": "January 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dorset England", "Title": "\u201cI love the Sevilla Inn and go there every year\u201d", "Author": "Boyd-M", "ReviewID": "UR10851433", "Content": "I have stayed at this inn for severeal years this October being the latest, I had a beautiful room very well furnished a king size bed with lovely bed linen and very lovely furniture ( I was told it was a newly refurbished room and that all rooms would be refurbished in time.) The staff were very helpful in fact I would say they couldn't have been nicer , how could anyone say they weren't is beyond my belief the only complaint was that the pool is cold and its not very attractive although there are plenty of sun beds ( one or two had broken straps ) tables and chairs and a BBQ. I really enjoy it there and will for sure use them again the next time I am in Orlando which is my annual vacation centre. Thanks to the manager , he was so helpful I never saw the owners but have done so in previous stays there they are always very helpful too as I was on the first floor the staff carried my luggage up and down the starirs, Thanks to them also.

I did not expect a place as affortable as this one to be so much more pleasant and clean then other places I have paid more for. I recommend this family operated motel to all families especially those with little ones. My kids really enjoyed it and so did I.

We had booked a weeks stay at the Condo Lodge. What a mistake that was. As we left the Condo Lodge, looking for a suitable place to stay, we went up and down 192, looking for a place that had a vacancy. Sevilla Inn did. We went into the office and were greeted by wonderful people, that couldn't help us enough. They had 2 ajoining rooms, which we checked out first, and took immediately. Through our entire 7 day stay at this family owned Inn, we were always greeted with respect, chatted with us about the things to do in the area, and just plain were lovely people to deal with. The business is owned by a husband and wife, and the daughter works there too. The husband is very well informed on golf, all the coarses, and talked non stop with my husband regarding golf, as they both loved the game. He went out of his way to call the coarses for my husband and get tee times for him. The wife and their daughter couldn't do enough for us. What wonderful people and a wonderful, wonderful place to stay. I give this Inn a gold star!! Travel to Kissimmee Florida, and stay at this clean and neat Inn.

It was our first trip to Florida. The initial part of our stay was quite comfortable. The room was tidy and the rooms were acceptable. We were quite surprised at the size of the pool (it was quite small) and did not appear heated. One night that we were staying there, the alarm went off and we never did understand what had happened. Other than that, the hotel itself was fine. One incident saw them coming to our room to deal with the toilet being plugged and them accusing us of having put disposal women's pads down there, even though my wife had no such need nor did we do such a thing. Unfortunately, the clearest memory of the stay was upon checking out when we were advised that we would be charged for \"ironing burns to the carpet\". We were actually scolded at not using iron boards which were available to the rooms, yet there were no postings seen of such availabilities (we had ironed our clothes over blankets laid out on the floor). Although we had not seen any damages to the carpet, the staff became insistent that they were there and, quite frankly, made us very uncomfortable at the tones of their voices. They charged us $20.00 for the supposed burns, which we did not argue and paid, and we were off. We have been back to Kissimmee a few times since, but have never since considered staying at the Sevilla Inn. I am still not sure if the burns were actually there, but giving them the benfit of the doubt, our biggest complaint was with the manner in which they treated us. They weren't very friendly whenever we had to interact with them.", "Date": "July 9, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia", "Title": "\u201cwe liked it\u201d", "Author": "jadziadax", "ReviewID": "UR932825", "Content": "We really liked staying here. We had just finished at WDW's Caribbean Resort $129 a night and went on to stay at Sevilla Inn. Yes Sevilla Inn is a timeshare resort and they only very softly tried to encourage you on that subject. But you got lots of freebies, free dinner and karaoke one night. It was a really friendly place and had a nice pool. Very good for only $33 a night. I think I got the idea to stay there from the Fodors guide also. The room was basic but not a lot different from the expensive WDW resort we had just stayed in. Not as flash but way better price. You are not trapped at Sevilla Inn for the food side of things. Which is how we felt at the WDW resort. (trapped into paying exorbitant prices for their food).
