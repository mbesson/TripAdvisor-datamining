Three weeks prior to our arrival all the hotels I checked had no vacancy until I found Edan roc. I felt lucky they had availability. Now I know why. To begin with I thought it unusual I had to send a check for one day to hold our reservation. When we arrived we had to pay for the remaining 3 days up front.Again unusual. We went to our room. the porch was 12 inches wide with a broken chair. Red flag. In the room 2 beds. Sqeaky and soft, no blankets, no tissues, no hair dryer, no iron, towels were small, thin and like sand paper and no coffee pot,no clock.Paying for ice was the kicker. Noticed all the hotels in the area had no vacancy signs except Edan Roc. What a surprise. I thought it was over priced for what they offered. the only positive was that it was close to the boardwalk and beach.

We stayed in the Motel part which is right behind the boardwalk. There is also efficency apartments on the boardwalk. Check in was smooth. Staff, for the most part kept to themselves, unless you had a question or request. We asked for pillows and got them right away. The room was very clean. The pool was very nice and clean. Our room was poolside and I saw the staff cleaning and vacuming the pool every night. There was some comotion from another room and the staff, with the police resolved quickly. (However, we didn't mind too much. Free entertainment.) I think the only thing we didn't like was that you had to pay for the use of the ice machine.

Most other places wanted over 200$ a night while the Eden Roc was low $100. So we went in with a mind of this place may be outdated, dirty, and small. Turned out it was not as bad as imagined. Beds were nice and clean. We checked both for bedbugs upon arrival and any unusual critters. It is not the biggest room but adequate size. The floors are tiled so sand from the beach makes it way into room and if you walk on floors barefoot you will accumulate sand.

We like to stay on the Boardwalk for the convenience (and because it isn't crowded after Labor Day). Last year we were at a nicer hotel, but the price...let's just say, we were looking to save some money and have more to spend on steamed crabs! So we gave the Eden Roc a try. The room was large, but the space is odd---it's a long, narrow room with two beds and a sofa-sleeper against one wall. Bathroom was clean, kitchen was clean, liked the full size fridge. The decor and bed linens are best described as \"tired.\" Everything was clean, it just felt dumpy. The balcony is not private, but we were there in off-season, so had it to ourselves anyway--but that might be an issue for some. We loved being on the boardwalk, steps away from the beach. This place had the best price by far for an ocean-front efficiency on the boardwalk, but I think we'll spend the extra money and go back to the nicer hotel next year. Bottom line is, we aren't as budget-conscious as we thought.

Room was clean when going in, they have tile flooring, not carpet..so wore socks the whole time while we were there. They never must of swept the floors, sand and what ever you may have dropped would still be there. So, I actually had an old bed sheet that I was going to use for the beach, but laid it out on the floor, because they never cleaned it. Bathroom was a nice size small towels, then was ready for bed and lifted the comforter and had a brown bug in it and it was alive...no!! it wasn't a bed bug, but still a bug is a bug!! So, the kind of person I am I had a hard time sleeping..which I'm sure every person would after that. And of course did a whole sweep of the bed. We were on the back side, the steps going up were very old and steep, so don't stay on the back side, stay closer to the pool. The pool was nice, the place seemed to have a lot of noise compared to the motel that was \"right next door\" which was weird, you would like it would be the same, but it wasn't. Well, on our last day, as always I do a double, triple look to make sure we got everything and looked on my husband's side of the bed..my son and I slept on the other bed while we were there, so anyway, when I lifted the pillow (hotels) pillow there was a dead maggot under the pillow!! I was like OMG..So, I haven't actually told him yet!!

The lampshades and pillows were stained but I always bring my own pillows. The hotel employees were very helpful for anything we needed. The parking was a little scarce but if nothing at the hotel was available they gave us a parking pass to park in the parking garage right next door. They rent bikes for the boardwalk in the morning. My only real complaint would be about the pool. The kids were very unruly. There are a list of rules on the pool gate and I think not a person was obeying. They had glass bottles, floating devices and balls which none were allowed. The kids chased each other and ran around until one fell and hit his head on the concrete. Not one employee came in and said a word to any of these kids. Sure they were having fun and I have kids of my own but for some of the older foks staying there it was an inconvience for them.

We had no remote in the room at first so they had to bring one in. We arrived late around 9 our first night and there was one towel in the room so we had to go down and ask for more, then wait for someone to bring them up.

We loved the tile floors - no smelly , gross , dirty carpet. The staff was more than happy to accomodate us with a broom and dust pan to sweep any sand that we had tracked in. House keeping did a fine job - clean towels , empty trash cans , cleaning the bathroom and etc. The rates on the room at the Roc actually afforded us two more nights in OC. We have booked ourselves there this year as well. As far as parking went, there is a 5 or 6 floor parking garage directly beside the hotel, so I am not sure how parking could be an issue unless you are just too lazy to walk around the corner to get into an elevator.

I stayed in the motel portion, not the efficiencies. I went twice while in college. The first time I went with 2 college friends and though it looked cheesy on the outside, the room itself was ok (motel style). The worst part of the stay was our room window facing construction and having that as our wake up call every morning. I went back again while in college, b/c as most people know when you don't have a lot of money, you have to take what you can get. I went with my boyfriend this time. Our room was significantly smaller (like half the size), similar to a closet, but b/c we were young and in love, we stayed at the beach and only came in to sleep. Overall, a college student with not a lot of money or on spring break or something of that nature would have no problem with it. Being that I am now 7 years older and I actually have a little money, you wont see me at the Eden Roc, but it served its purpose.
