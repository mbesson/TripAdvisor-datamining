The rooms are clean but they are a little bit old, some have a balcony. The service is very good, the location is ok, just a few minutes from China town with all the asian restaurants, les buttes aux Cailles. An area which looks like a small french country village and the commercial centre Place d'italie with all the shops. And it is just about 20 minutes walk to the market street Mouffetard and to university area, Quartier Latin. But one of the best thing is the extended breakfast with juice, cheese, eggs, yoghurt and cornflakes. Because normally you just get a coissant and jam in a 2 star hotel in France.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ohio", "Title": "\u201cGREAT BARGIN\u201d", "Author": "Truto", "ReviewID": "UR122592868", "Content": "Hotel Manet is a hidden gem among Paris Hotels. Located near the Place d'Itali Metro Stop on Line 7, the Hotel is an easy walk on a very quiet side street. We take the Roissy Bus from de Gaulle Airport and walk across the street to the Metro Station. The Hotel has some of the largest rooms we have found in a 2 or 3 Star Hotel in Paris, with excellent bath facilities. It is also one of the cleanest. The staff speaks very little English, but falls all over themselves to accomodate their guests. While we rarely eat the Hotel breakfast to save on costs, the Manet comes close to many 3 Star Hotel's in their selections. The Place di' Itali area has a very large and modern Mall that has everything you may have forgotten to bring, includiing a large selection of electric current adapters in the Paris equivilent of a Home Depot. Printemps Department Store has a nice branch located there. We found area restaurants average at best, prefering to eat at the wide selection of bistros on the famed rue Mouffetard, just two very short Metro stops away. Metro Line 7 has stops very near Mouffetard, Notre Dame, the Louvre, Opera, and the two major Department Stores, with connections to almost every other Metro line, placing the Manet much closer to where you want to be than it appears,", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Petersburg", "Title": "\u201cA very reasonable choice!\u201d", "Author": "Catalina1001", "ReviewID": "UR121136432", "Content": "Hotel Manet is a quiet, comfortable and clean place just 5 minutes away from metro and bus stop. Everything is very clean. The view out of the window is lovely. The room is of a normal size, the bathroom is pretty small, frankly speaking, but we didn't mind at all (in one of the apartments where I used to live it was smaller :)). The breakfast was excellent! All dairy products and especially croissants were sooo tasty! Now a few things useful for those who needs to work in the room. Free wi-fi was very handy, but please mind: they have a strange plug with 3 holes in it, and if you have too many devices you'll have to work without a lamp or do everything in turns:(. Wi-fi was ok for mail and surfing, but sometimes too slow for Skype calls. You can print out all documents, the computer with the printer is on the first floor. The service is very good. Everybody was really helpful and welcome! The only thing which I'd like to draw your attention to is: they do not speak English. Out of 5 administrators and 2 waitresses to which we talked, only one spoke English. They all understood what we wanted in the end, of course, but this was a little bit awkward. This fact is very common in France, so we were aware of it and brought a dictionary :) which helped a great deal! So guys revise your French! All in all it was a very enjoyable experience, if I ever have a chance to come back I'd choose Manet: great service and location for a very reasonable price!", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cVery nice and well-priced small hotel\u201d", "Author": "Mabroi", "ReviewID": "UR120084230", "Content": "Our family of five spent three nights last week at this very reasonably priced hotel. Our two rooms were both simply furnished but comfortable and had good views over the rooftops of Paris. The bathrooms were excellent - modern and kept very clean. The reception staff were without exception friendly and helpful. We took breakfast at local cafes but the hotel provides a reasonable buffet for (I think) 8 Euros p.p.

The service was excellent and we even had a small balcony in our room where we could see over the rooftops of the other beautiful buildings.

You can look on hotel websites for hours and still be wondering where to stay. The main problem is that everywhere in Paris is expensive and you never really know what you will get. All we wanted was to stay in a hotel that was in a good location, clean, had a comfortable bed, had a nice bathroom, and one that didn't make us feel claustrophobic. My friend recommended Hotel Manet to us and it was exactly what we were hoping for. The rooms are not huge by any means but it's a decent size especially for Paris. Everything in the room along with the bathroom were clean. There was free wifi internet. The windows open so you can get fresh air but I can't remember seeing temperature control. The location was great because the hotel was only a 2-3 minute walk from the metro station. You have access to 3 different metro lines so you are really well connected. Nearby is an area with many restaurants which was also handy. We didn't try the continental breakfast but from a glance, there was bread and spreads, someone would cook eggs on order, and there seemed to be tea and coffee. People might be turned off by it's low star rating but star ratings mean absolutely nothing in Paris. If you are looking to stay somewhere that's pleasant without spending a fortune and that allows you to travel around easily, Hotel Manet is the ideal choice.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rochester New York", "Title": "\u201cA great find\u201d", "Author": "Ktech", "ReviewID": "UR75605021", "Content": "We stayed 4 nights with our two children.
