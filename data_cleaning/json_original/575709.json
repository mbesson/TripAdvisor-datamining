This is a great hotel. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were really nice with very high ceilings, great antiques, and very interesting furniture throughout the hotel.

The location is terrific--close to the river and very easy to walk to all of the necessary attractions. It's about a 10 minute walk to the train station, 15 minutes to the Duomo etc. The rooms are clean, the mattresses are thin and the bathroom is clean and has a shower. The ceilings are very high so this gives the room a more spacious feel. Our room faced the street and there was a lot of street noise throughout the night as drivers sped by. Also, please note that there is a disco down the street that plays music until 3-3:30 am and the bass beat is clearly audible in the hotel room. The hotel is secure and has a person at the front desk who will let you in if you are out late--just make arrangements with him. The front desk people did understand English so that was helpful for us. There is no air conditioning, but they did have a fan. It moved the air but towards the end of the week when the humidity was high, the fan was not very effective. The breakfast is included and again, it is basic but acceptable. Coffee, juice, cereal, buns, meats, cheese and an assortment of sweet cakes. We liked the location but the noise level got annoying by the end of our stay. We wouldn't stay here again but it was okay.", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR415314253", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Canteach"}, {"Content": "Lovely Place. We had 3 nights in this hotel, and thought it was great, the staff where very nice, breakfast was strange but nice, lots of cakes!! I enjoyed it myself, wife not too keen, I read that the night porter was rude and not very nice, to be honest I found him fine, I spoke a little of my very shaky Italian to him to which he burst out laughing, then put me right, and was quite chatty when came in or left at night, typical italian male comes to work on a scooter, looks like ha has eaten a bit to much pasta, I didn't find him rude at all, a little non understanding at first, I think he must struggle a bit with the English language, but once through that barrier he was fine.We took the train to Lucca, wonderful medevil walled town, you must go see it, but don't forget to get your train ticket authenticated with the little puch machines on the platforms, otherwise the ticket collector on the train gets the hump with you.We used Teravison bus service to get us from the airport to Florance, but it seems at this time of the year it is a bit shaky, our return bus did not turn up, to take us back to the airport, but this is not a problem as the pick up point is the train station, so just hop on the train, it will take you right to Pisa Airport. no worries.", "Date": "Dec 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR278343981", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "thrisey"}, {"Content": "affordable, authentic If you are on a budget, this is the place. you won't get bit by any bedbugs, the rooms are clean and ours had a updated Italian Marble bathroom.

Overall the hotel was nice and the staff quite friendly. However, definately look at the room before you take it. Ours seemed nice until we went to bed and found a giant creepy crawly. To be fair, from the large layer of dust in the room it seemed like the room had not been used in a really long time. In future I would have asked for a different room upon arrival. Good for the price, and very central, in a quiet area.", "Date": "Jul 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR836677852", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Beautiful Place Beautiful rooms, very clean and the breakfast is delicious.
