During the first visit, the place was packed with families doing the Southern California thing, kids were splashing in the pool, and the hotel had a pleasant vacation vibe. During the second visit in December 2011, the place was empty and creepy, and I was awoken one morning by the shouts of a seemingly deranged man being evicted from an adjoining room. The difference is that, between the two visits, the owners of the hotel dropped their affiliation agreement with Days Inn. They may have saved money by not paying the franchise fee, but the number and quality of guests seem to have plummeted as a result. It's a shame, because the motel is in a highly convenient, otherwise upscale neighborhood with shops and restaurants within walking distance.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat value in Studio City\u201d", "Author": "fles44", "ReviewID": "UR121337049", "Content": "Studio City Courtyard, formerly Days Inn, has the same attentive owners and the best value, by far.

The owners and staff are all like family, we actually miss them when we travel back to Australia. They're always helpful and ready to do anything they can to help out. Carlos the groundsman even washed a mark off my car for me and changes the lightbulbs if they blow. If anything is wrong in your room, Carlos is the man! Gloria makes the best waffles for breakfast. Breakfast is in the office area and is the BEST!! They have waffles made fresh when you ask for them, bagels, toast, mini muffins which are delishious, apples & banana's, 3 different cereals, juices and tea and coffee. So enough to keep you going until lunch time, I always put on weight when I leave this hotel as I end up having the waffles each morning. At home I would normally only eat toast or cereal. We stay in one of the studio rooms to the left when you pull in the drive way, the rooms are huge and there is also a dressing room area, king size bed, table and chairs and a sofa & coffee table. I've had friends that stay in really expensive hotels and all they get is a small square room with a queen bed, it might be flash and made of marble but I prefer the extra space and furnisings. One thing I should mention are the beds at the Days Inn, they are seriously the best beds I've ever slept in, in the world, the mattress's are so comfy and the pillows devine, I sleep more hours here than I do in my own bed. I can't say enough about the beds, this hotel has gone out of its way to make sure they have the best in comfort. Another bonus is they have free parking and if you don't drive there is a bus line right outside Ralphs which is across the road. Ralphs is a huge supermarket. There is also alot of restaurants and shops all within walking distance. The wifi is free and super fast, much faster than our internet back in Australia. The owners are super nice people and this is definitely our number one place to stay each time we're in Los Angels recording.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mississauga, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat value, nice room\u201d", "Author": "missmattie", "ReviewID": "UR119501524", "Content": "We chose to stay here because it was close to a highway which meant we could get to many of the attractions in LA/Hollywood easily. The area felt safe even at night. There is a Walgreens/CVS or Ralph's in every direction from the hotel, but you definitely need a car. Room: - It was an old room but it was very well maintained and very clean - We had one king size bed which was very comfy and the housekeeping did a great job - The room is spacious, there is a separate dressing area where there is a large vanity mirror, counter space, coffee maker, fridge & lots of places to hang clothes up and store luggage. (see photos) - The TV is an older model, but it worked and we were barely watched TV anyway - Washroom is older but everything works fine - Shower head is very low. I am 5'2\" and it was just right. If you're any taller than me, it's going to be a challenge to shower. - One morning we could hear the neighbour on the phone. We're not sure if it was coming through the wall or somehow through our phone - kinda wierd! Hotel Common Areas: - Parking is limited so if you are staying over a Friday or Saturday night, you might have to park on the street if you get back to the hotel late - The driveway divides the larger section of the hotel from the other side (where we stayed). I found it fairly quiet, even when there were kids in the pool or down in the courtyard. - No elevators so if you have heavy luggage (or a lot of it), request a room on the main floor - Breakfast is great! It's not extravagant but it's just right - good muffins, cereals, waffles, juice, coffee, etc. They don't have a large selection but what they have tastes good - Front Desk staff was very courteous. I had booked a non-smoking room but for some reason my reservation said smoking. When I explained it to the man at the front desk, he was more than happy to help me and tried to get me a corner room (because we were worried about noise) - If you want a late night snack, Domino's delivers and they must be close by because they brought our order in 20 minutes!", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lenexa, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cOk hotel room.\u201d", "Author": "chelmail", "ReviewID": "UR119184387", "Content": "This is a perfectly nice hotel to stay in while visiting the Hollywood area.

There was also a McDonald's fairly close. What I loved was that there were two big king beds in our one bedroom suite. That was great with 5 people. However the sofa bed was hard as a rock. There was free parking and that was perfect. However, parking is a little tight. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. For breakfast they have waffles, cereal, muffins, juice and coffee, bananas and apples. It is a small area but there are a couple of tables outside. The rooms are old but our suite was spacious if we didn't have the couch out into a bed. I would have preferred a two room suite however. It is always hard being in the same room with kids.

The contractors were painting and Gardeners replanting flowers in the courtyard. Rooms are no frills, but have all the basics. Bathrooms are very antiquated in need of new tiles and plumbing. BEWARE hot water will heat up and burn you if you are not careful it turns itself up when someone flushes the toliet or turns on the sink faucet. Pros= Close to Universal 10 minutes by car, close to Hollywood 15 minutes by car, and Santa Monica Pier 25 minutes by car.

From the outset, all I was looking for was: 1) a clean and affordable place to rest my head, 2) a swimming pool, 3) a complimentary breakfast, 4) a free daily newspaper in the morning, and 5) relatively easy access to the Universal Metro Rail station. This hotel satisfied all of my above requirements, though I would preferred a paper other than USA Today. I arrived in LA with a packed itinerary, and was mostly concerned with getting around town and seeing stuff. Whatever the shortcomings of this hotel, it wasn't that big a deal for my purposes. It was clean, quiet and free of cockroaches. (As an aside, I highly recommend the $11 weekly pass from Metro, which allows you to ride any bus or train within the Metro system. From this hotel, you're about a five or ten minute bus ride from Universal station. Once at Universal, the trains can take you to various far-flung corners of LA faster than you would in a car. Also, I found the Metro organization very helpful in my pre-planning. I requested a system map in the mail, and they sent me a gargantuan-sized package that greatly increased my knowledge of the routes I'd need to take.)", "Date": "July 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Prince George, BC", "Title": "\u201cDays inn and out.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5207777", "Content": "We spent one night in this hotel. That was enough for me. The room was very large, but I'm sure if I looked around I would have left. It seemed kinda strange. We had 2 king beds and a pull out sofa. We needed to call the front desk for sheets and blankets for the sofa bed. And when the airport dropped off our missed bag, the front desk called us the next morning saying that \"there was something here for you\", not saying \"your bag is here\" or \"the airport dropped off your bag\". It was a weird call, he didn't seem sure it was even me he was talking to. The breakfast is really bad and the staff didn't even say good morning or hello to me when I walked in. My husband was brave enough to take a shower and he said there was mold in the top corners of the shower, and that the shower head was so low, he had to go on his knees to wash his hair.

The rooms have a terrible chemical odor that smell like cleaning chemicals that are attempting to cover up other musty odors. The rooms surrounding ours must have sent out flyers to announce their party as there was loud music, shouting, banging, blaring TVs etc going until 5 AM.

Liked the rate, but as they say, you get what you pay for. For some reason our room had the most pervasive musty/moldy odor I have ever experienced in the West. Perhaps the room has had a history of being flooded. They tried to mask the musk with various sickeningly sweet scents, but it only made the room smell even worse. To add to the problem, the main window would not open. We kept the door open as long as we could with the air going, but were very uncomfortable even as we slept, and got up at 6 am so that we could air ourselves out and try to change rooms. I had to wash all my clothes, even those in my suitcase, as everything took on this strange awful odor. I got sick about 3 days later, the first time in 3 years. Whether it was coincidence or not I could not say. The management was ok, but not really interested in our complaint about the room's terrible odor and no other room was available there. One other odd thing about the place is that it has a u-shaped driveway that goes around the rear of the complex. The 'exit' is padlocked shut, so if you have a large vehicle and the lot is busy, you have to back all the way around and out of the driveway. Just an extra irritant to an uncomfortable stay and I wonder about the fire safety of such an arrangement, as there is only one driveway in and out of this motel.", "Date": "October 17, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Downey, CA", "Title": "\u201cNice little hotel\u201d", "Author": "lfite", "ReviewID": "UR3622519", "Content": "Really clean rooms!
