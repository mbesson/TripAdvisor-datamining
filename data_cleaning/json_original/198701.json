On the plus side this hotel is centrally located and about 5-10 minutes walk to the metro, bus station and high end department stores. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful when approached. My bed and mattress did wonders for my 15 year backache, truly! Even though freezing outside the hotel, bedroom and bathroom were very warm. Less than positive was the smell of cigar smoke from the attached cigar bar, the cost of the continental breakfast which at around \u00a315 a day was very pricey. I recommend Cafe Swartz about 2 blocks away (turn right at theTchibo store and cross over) where we had a hearty and beautifully presented breakfast at half the price. The interior corridors of the hotel were reminiscent of the hotel in 'The Shining' and quite scary at night! My single room was at the end of a hallway adjacent to the staff stairwell. It had beautiful oriental tapestry artwork on the walls to cheer up an otherwise dark 1930's style room, an art deco floored shower room, a safe, TV, desk, chair etc and complementary mineral water each day. The curtains didn't hide the cracked plasterwork and the windows were quite drafty and for non-city dwellers the noise from a nearby metro bridge as well as the bar/restaurant across the way would be distruptive to a good night's sleep - I found it quite comforting in an otherwise too quiet hotel. Most annoying for a modern city was the lack of free WiFi with the exception of Starbucks. The hotel only offers a computer in Reception and charged daily for WiFi. The posh McDonald's showed off their iPads but did not offer WiFi to customers. As this was my first visit to Berlin I was initally disappointed by the greyness around me but the people were lovely and very helpful. I preferred East Berlin for its pre and post war history, what little remains of its jewish past, the architecture and its overall timelessness especially around Alexanderplatz, the Berlin Cathedral and Museum Island where there are magical Christmas Markets nearby. Checkout the huge circular aquarium at the Radisson Blu Hotel! For the first time ever, I did not take one photo of my room or the hotel and I had my new Panasonic Lumix to hand at all times!

It has probably been a more fashionable hotel in the past but is still quite \"high standard\". We had booked a suite with the \"Travelmore.com\"-site for two nights. Unfortunately the Savoy Hotel said they didn't have any information about that. They where fully booked and we got a very ordinary room instead the first night. As a compensation we were offered a \"free\" breakfast one morning. Lesson learned: always check with the hotel itself that they have got your reservation right before going there. It has happened to me a couple of times that reservations have not worked. What has worked always is the withdrawal of my money from my bank account. Strange that never fails... The first room was average but clean and okay as such. The suite we got the other night was very nice and absolutely well worth the money. Not that big but a separate living room, working space and bedroom. A very fancy bathroom that gave a taste of luxury. The feeling we had expected arriving the friday night to celebrate my birthday.

I could here not only the trains, but also some German speaking lady who had a fight with someone for more than an hour late in the night (could not understand her German, but the crying was quite international); - overheating. There is no climatization system installed and the only way to get rid of the annoying heat was to open the balcony door. At freezing temperatures and after taking a shower, it was not a very smart idea, but the only working one, as I could not figure out how to turn down the classic heater in the room (no sign for on/off and actually no idea if it was working or not) - very, but very soft mattress.

We unfortunately arrived at 6am from an over night train and had no choice but to leave our bags and sit around and wait for anything in the near area to open after 9am. We also had to come back to check in at 3pm, so we went to the zoo until the afternoon and we could check in. Upon checking in we were pretty pleased with the size and spaciousness of the room, having a couch, chairs and two beds and a huge bathroom (for Europe) so we felt we made a good choice. We then found out that internet is not included in the rate, and you have to pay PER device to have access to it. Being that my husband run an internet business this was extremely frustrating not being able to just pay for access for both computers. The internet problems got worse, it kept dropping the signal from one of our brand new Macbooks and then every time our computer went to sleep it would not let us back on the internet, it's like it thought it was a security issue or something and we couldn't even get to the main page to sign in. We basically had to use only 1 computer for our stay here and bought multiple internet packages trying to get the other one to work to no avail. The other problem, was the confusing information from the front staff. When we asked about internet prices we were told on the phone it was 1 hour or 5 hours, so we ended up buying consecutive 5 hour packages because no one told us until we left that we could have access for 24 hours for 10 euros instead of 5 hours for 7 euros! Also I inquired on a city tour and a man working the night shift told me to just come down any time in the morning and they would sell us tickets and give us a brochure for a tour they run every 50 minutes. Well the next day we go down and another man tells us the tours are ONLY at 10 am and 2pm and we have to wait! We asked where to go and he gives us an address of number 217 on a street 2 blocks away. So we went for lunch and then decided to go look for this supposed bus stop. Which we did not get the name of by the way. Then we see 3 different companies of busses, with people selling tickets everywhere, so now it's looking like there are tours all day and we were misinformed that there was only a tour twice a day! We bought a tour and found out the busses come every 10 minutes until 6pm... It would have been nice to do the tour earlier since it proceeded to rain the rest of the day and we basically saw the whole city from inside the bus without getting off because of the rain. I am really not sure if there is some sort of communication issue, since they speak English there, and my husband was speaking German to them, but it seems like we kept getting the run around and confusing information from the front desk staff. I would have to say that since it's their job to give the right information they need to work on that. At least suggest the same tour, not each person give different information when being asked about a standard city tour! We decided against staying at a hotel owned by the same company on our trip to Munich because of the internet being extra. We cannot take chances with having problems and not being able to work and paying for this. So we selected a higher end hotel that included internet.

Three elements in particular go to make it enjoyable: it feels like a family run hotel rather than a cloned establishment created by a big chain; the staff are very helpful and friendly; the breakfast is a wonderful spread of good quality food served in an elegant and peaceful environment. The hotel is located in the Fasanenstrasse, which transects the Ku'damm. It is just a few minutes walk from the Bahnhof Zoo and Savigny Platz U- and S-Bahn stations which means one is on a direct route to Berlin Mitte and Sch\u00f6nefeld airport in one direction and Potsdam and Wannsee in the other (the same lines run through both Zoo and Savigny Platz stations). The Ku'damm shopping area is also just a few minutes walk. The public parts of the hotel itself are decorated in a rich red colour. Rooms are pleasantly but done but I wouldn't describe them as luxurious. The bathrooms in some of the rooms I have stayed in are a bit dated but everything functions perfectly. TV had channels in various languages; the minibar had a decent choice of beverages. The breakfast, as mentioned above, is excellent and, although it is a buffet, it is an eminently civilsed affair and there is never any queueing and nothing ever seems to run out. There is a wide choice (even for me, a fussy eater) and everything looked very fresh. Slightly oddly, there is free champagne but if one wants freshly squeezed fruit juice there is an extra charge. I travelled with my dog and, as always, he was made very welcome by staff. The hotel has a high end cigar bar. Although it is sealed off from the rest of the public areas there is a faint smell of cigar smoke, although I personally found this rather pleasant. A final point - one aspect I like about the hotel is it's history: many film stars have been there in the past and their names are indicated on the doors of the rooms in which they stayed. During the Second World War, the hotel was taken over as the Japanese embassy when the original one got bombed and then, after the end of the war, it was for a while British Army HQ. So there is a bit of a kick in staying in a place which is so full of history, particularly in Berlin.

The location of the hotel is not the best-in hindsight, I think it would have been better to have stayed in the east of the city, as this was where we spent the majority of our time. Walking from the hotel to the Brandenburg Gate took well over an hour, and while we prefer walking in cities to taking public transport, many others will find the S-Bahn a must! That's not to say that the Savoy is badly located for tourists-the Ku'Damm and Kaiser Wilhelm Church are big attractions, and only five minutes away-but there are better areas to use as a base. We also found the area around the nearby Europa Centre to be quite uncomfortable at times, with gangs of rowdy teenagers going out of their way to bother the tourists walking around. The hotel itself is on quite an unattractive street, and the exterior doesn't really bring to mind the impression it likes to give of a luxury celebrity dwelling. Once inside, things are a lot grander, but it all feels quite old-fashioned with the impression of trying to live off past glories. The reception area is also very smoky and fuggy from the adjacent cigar room. We found the reception staff to be friendly and efficient though, and not as snobby as I was worried they'd be on walking in! The room itself was very big for the price (the bathroom was especially large, especially in comparison to a lot of similarly-priced hotels around the continent) and clean, but like the lobby, it felt rather faded and old. The dark mahogany around the room was clearly meant to make it look grander than it was, and it all just felt a bit desperate. It was comfortable, and like I said, the size of the room was excellent, but it was all just a little false and strange. Amenities-wise, there was free bottled water, bathrobes and toiletries, a mini-bar and the TV had a number of English speaking channels. However, despite being listed when we booked, there was no in-room safe. We did not try the restaurant or bar, but they seemed to be fairly busy in the evenings when we passed by.

Our room was quite large and quaint and overlooked the outdoor patio. We awoke to birdsongs every morning and it was a lovely start to the day. The beds, although European in style, were quite comfortable. The bathroom was large, but quaint. I don't think the hotel has air conditioning - if it does, it has no obvious temperature controls in the room. Some reviewers compained about noise, but we had our windows open and found the room to be quiet. The hotel guests seemed to be mainly German speaking - so this hotel did not appear to cater to North American tourists per se, but the staff speak English and communication was not an issue. On the other hand, I did not go on vacation to have a North American experience - if we wanted that we would have stayed home. So this hotel fit my needs very well - it was a slice of Europe. Some reviewers have compained about the cigar bar off the lobby and the accompanying cigar odor. We did not find the smell of cigars to be particularily strong or offensive. So it was not an issue. What was shocking was the price of breakfast. Our room rate did not include breakfast (if you stay here - make sure it's included before you eat there) and when the bill came it was 19 Euro per person - my cereal and croissant cost almost $30....But, its Europe and I should have known. For the rest of our stay, we walked half a block to a lovely coffee shop for pastries and deliciously european coffee - under 10 Euro for two. The hotel has a convenient location - it is near many restaurants and small coffee shops, only two blocks from Ku'damm and the upscale shops therein, and within walking distance of many attractions. The area has undergone rennovation and you will find lovely shops, restraurants, bars, and theatres within mere blocks of the hotel.

Although the decor seems woefully outdated, it actually made a refreshing change to be staying somewhere with a character of its own, a place that didn't feel like it might have been assembled entirely from flatpack kits from Ikea. Spotlessly clean, the room was fresh and temperatures perfectly set centrally to offset the climate outside. The bathroom was also immaculately kept, but I did notice one out of place tile that really should have been fixed long ago. There were only two things about the room I didn't like. Firstly, although they supply one complimentary bottle of mineral water a day, there are no tea / coffee making facilities. Secondly, one of our bedside cabinets had an old radio built into it that had strangely been disconnected. Was a bit of a shame, because listening to local stations on a retro radio would have added to the overall atmosphere greatly. Staff were extremely pleasant and almost stereotypically efficient. Room service was carried out with an exact professionalism I've never experienced anywhere else, though it's quite galling that they charge a \u20ac4 service charge - this really should be set at around 10 -15%. Other reviewers are right to say that there is a heavy smell of cigar smoke in the lobby, but for me this was just part of the quirky, yesteryears feel of the place.

The room and bathroom were very clean. However, our room didn't look as though it had been updated since the 1970's. The bedroom was very tired and not at all luxurious: the sheets were threadbare, the TV was old and the remote didn't work, the limewashed woodwork was old fashioned, the windows didn't keep out the noise of the traffic and trains on the railway overpass (which is only a few hundred yards away from the front of the hotel).
