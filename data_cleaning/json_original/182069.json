When we got there, it had a small lobby and didn\u2019t look like much. The parking lot was small, but free. So that was a good deal. When we got to the counter (11:00 at night), things changed. We were greeted by Sunny who was the most delightful gentleman. He was ever so gracious and was most accommodating to all of us. I had somehow lost my AAA card (which I had specifically brought with me for this visit). He took my word on being a AAA member. He then upgraded me (for no particular reason) to a King bed, even though I had reserved a Queen. Then, for my friends, he upgraded 2 of them to a suite \u2013 again \u2013 for no particular reason. I could not believe the welcoming attitude of this gentleman. I can\u2019t remember ever staying somewhere where someone went so much out of their way to accommodate us.

The hotel is definitely an older facility, but the room was quite large and very clean. The bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were awesome. The bathroom was nice, had a bowed out shower curtain (allowing more room in the shower). The soap/shampoo/conditioner were all in a machine on the wall \u2013 very convenient. The water pressure was good. There was also a coffee maker, iron, microwave, and refrigerator in the room. The room I had looked out to some houses behind us, but above them, I had a very nice view of the mountains. The room was very quiet. I didn\u2019t hear anything at all outside my room that night or the next morning. When we went to breakfast, the continental breakfast was fairly good. It had more than your typical fare \u2013 to include waffles. It wasn\u2019t amazing or anything, but it was decent and better than I expected. The suite my friends had was quite nice. The bedrooms were split into two parts. One bed was in an area right near the front of the room. Then came the bathroom in the middle. The other bed was way in the back of the suite. This was nice, because it allowed people sharing a room to kind of have a more private area to sleep. I\u2019d never seen anything quite like this before. There was also a free computer in the lobby to check email, etc. A couple of folks mentioned previously here that this hotel is not in a good area. That is not true at all. It\u2019s definitely not an awesome area or anything, but there were no issues here of being in a bad area. It was just fine. I felt perfectly safe, and to be honest, I didn\u2019t see anyone on the streets that Saturday night. It was more of a residential area, with the Exhibition Park a couple of blocks away. The McDonalds was right across the street. That was pretty convenient. All in all, everyone in my group enjoyed the one night stay at the hotel. I\u2019ve definitely stayed in many nicer hotels before, and absolutely do not want to stay in dive or seedy motels. This hotel was anything but. It was perfectly comfortable, quiet, and clean. It wasn\u2019t the best place I\u2019ve ever stayed, but it was way more than satisfactory. And the price was also terrific. I would ABSOLUTELY stay here again. We were treated very well and enjoyed the comfort of the room (and especially the bed). The only complaint at all I have was that the bath towels were kind of small and thin. Other than that, everything was great. Thanks also to Sunny for his great hospitality. He was also there in the morning upon departure and was just as cordial.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City", "Title": "\u201cGreat Bang for the Buck and Even Better Service\u201d", "Author": "nycbee", "ReviewID": "UR24388975", "Content": "Stayed here for four nights while atttending the Four Continents figure skating competition at the Pacific Coliseum.

The room was an average hotel room in size, but there was a small table and two hard chairs and no other furniture--no comfortable place to sit besides the bed. The little table had no power outlet near it so I had to balance my computer on the little refrigerator to charge it in the very unsafe-looking extension cord (not a power strip) stretched behind the TV. They offer HS internet through Tellus for $15 per night and it worked the night I arrived but not in the morning. I rebooted but no internet. I tried to call Tellus customer service but the hotel phone buzzed so loud I couldn't hear. When I called the front desk, they weren't helpful. They offer some sort of continental breakfast, but when I asked about fruit, the desk clerk said \"Oh, we offer at least two kinds, apples and oranges or apples and bananas\". Only frozen oatmeal and cold cereal. And when I asked for a suggestion for a real breakfast nearby, he couldn't help me.

Me and my husband didn't feel safe walking down the street at night, by any means. And about 10 blocks down the street, towards downtown, is the absolute worst part of Vancouver. Actually, when we were in the cab to the hotel on the way from the airport, the cab driver actually winced when we told him where we were staying. Almost all of the cabs we took went 5--10 blocks out of the way to avoid driving through the parts of town closest to the hotel. When it came to the actual hotel, it had a very, very strange smell. Almost like the strongest moth balls you'll ever experience. Thankfully it was only in the hallways and disappeared once you got into the room. The hallway ceilings had gaping holes in them and water stains. Fortunately, the rooms were much nicer than the hallway or lobby suggested. Comfy bed (we got the king), with a fridge, which was helpful since we stayed 5 nights. Wireless internet costs a pretty penny, though. The rooms were quiet, housekeeping was good, the shower was nice. The continental breakfast was nice, and saved us some money. Most days, we took some extra fruit and muffins for snacks on our excursions. The people at the front desk were SUPER nice. When we checked in, the man pulled out a map and showed us all his favorite places to go, and explained all the public transit information. Truthfully, if like us, all of the things you want to do is in the Downtown Area, I'd recommend spending a little more money and getting closer to Downtown.
