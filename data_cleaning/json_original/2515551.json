It had lots of old fashioned charm that really appealed. OK the rooms were a bit smaller than many other faceless US hotels, but that only added to the charm in my view as it represented authentic hotels how they used to be. I have to say the noise was horrendous though, despite being on 8th floor facing away from the main entertainment strip. The problem is that the hotel has absolutey no soundproofing, and it's as though you had windows open fully. Despite fan being on, ear plugs and a pillow over my head, the noise was still disturbing.

There is also a nice rooftop patio - great views of the west and you get a close up of the original Hotel St. James sign. As far as the noise, we had no trouble with noise when we were in our room. Of course we specifically chose this hotel because of the close proximity to the Gaslamp Quarter. As we expected, there were a plethora or restaurants in walking distance and a very happening nightlife. I am always a fan of included breakfast, which this hotel does not provide, but there is a restaurant/bar connected to the lobby and I had some amazing chicken and waffles one morning. We also took advantage of the free airport shuttle provided by the hotel - a definite plus!

However, in 2011 when I had business in San Diego, I figured I'd try it out as a hotel. I wasn't disappointed. My first impression upon entering the hotel was somewhat of a put-off, as the lobby desk is a bit shabby, and the staff seems a little amateurish. However, the rooms themselves are nice and the staff turned out to be very personable and quite helpful. The rooms are small (I've stayed in two of them, so far), but they're decorated in the boutique hotel style. Though I was happy to be in the heart of the city and within a few blocks of restaurants and Horton Plaza (the downtown shopping mall), the loud music from adjacent bars had me concerned. Happily, the noise quieted right down at 10:00 PM, allowing me to wake refreshed for a meeting the next morning. A complimentary breakfast is offered on the rooftop deck, but since I'm a low-carb guy, there wasn't much for me to choose. Still, it's nice to have the option. I got my room during each stay for just under $100 a night before tax. For that price, it's hard to beat without going out to more suburban locations.

The historic elevator, while quaint, is nearly impossible to navigate with a roller bag and a shoulder bag. There\u2019s a door that opens outward and then a heavy gate you have to slide open to enter/exit the elevator. It\u2019s kinda tricky. I can't imagine someone who is weak or infirm trying to open the gate. The front desk staff was friendly enough. All in all, if I had to do it over again, I\u2019d probably stay in a more expensive, closer hotel, but the Ramada was satisfactory in terms of value.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "centel coast", "Title": "\u201cGreat staff.....Great location\u201d", "Author": "Allan G", "ReviewID": "UR118566748", "Content": "This hotel is in a great location in the gaslamp district.

Or, elevator singular -- the second was closed for the first part of my trip. Apparently the fastest elevators in the USA when they were installed in 1920-1930 (can't remember when). They're the kind of elevator cage doors you have to manually open. Kind of cool, but impossible to deal with while carrying luggage. There really needs to be a porter on the main floor to help people who are checking in open the cage elevator door. And also a bottle of Purell on each floor. The cage and outer door were sticky with oils and whatnot from other guests hands. The rooms are incredibly tiny, and beds even tinier. I was traveling alone, so this was fine, but had I been sharing the bed it would've been incredibly uncomfortable. It could've been a queen bed, but looked more like a double. The bathroom isn't actually separated from the room. The sink is in the bedroom area, next to the bed and make-shift closet. There is a sliding door that covers the entrance to the toilet and shower, but it isn't any different than having a curtain. If you are traveling alone, as I was, no big deal. But if you are traveling with another person, you will hear every sound as if it were in the same room. Because it is essentially in the same room. Sheets were clean, and the A/C which was a haphazard window unit, worked fine. The service at the front desk, complimentary airport shuttle, housekeeping... all were totally fine. The Gaslamp area is a questionable location. It could be perfect for you if you are a college student looking to party until the wee hours of the morning (as there are endless night clubs and bars and large crowds of other drunk or stoned people every 20 feet for about an eight-block radius) when you'll be able to drunkenly stagger into the hotel's lobby cafe for food at 4 AM (it's open 24 hrs and was PACKED at 4 AM with both late-night party-types; and also people who worked in nearby clubs and bars who had just gotten off work). One night I was standing outside of the hotel having a cigarette and was asked by a person just walking by at random, if I \"wanted any heroin?\" I simply said, No, thanks, and they asked, \"Crack?\" No, I said, I'm fine. \"Coke? Weed?\" Really, I said, I'm fine, thank you. They finally left me alone and walked on. Another night walking back from a restaurant, I was at the corner of the hotel outside the 24 hr cafe, and a young college kid, obviously drunk, asked me if I had any cocaine. In all my travels in a variety of places of the world I've never been asked to buy drugs or if I had them to share. This is why I'd consider the Gaslamp area questionable. I mean, if you like that kind of thing, great! Good for you. You'd have a ball staying at this hotel, as it's right in the center of it all. But if you are looking for something safer, or if you are traveling with kids, my advice is to stay anywhere but the Gaslamp area. I visited the restaurants in the Hillcrest area, which seemed much safer and calmer. Nicer. I didn't get to see any of the hotels by the beach, or in any other area.

I found that most of the employees there were very nice, but I don\u2019t feel that their friendly attitudes could make up for the condition of our hotel room. Our room was like a closet and very dirty. I felt obligated to wear flip flops while taking a shower as to not stand bare foot in the bathroom. I was completely stunned that a hotel room that cost as much as it did was in such bad shape. The walls were paper thin and we could hear normal voices talking next door to us, but they sounded as if they were in the same room with us. We were awakened very early in the morning by the sounds of other guests and the fire alarm going off for about 30 minutes. After falling back to sleep it happened again. We did not feel rested at all while we were there. Another BIG problem with our room was the lack of windows and lighting. The 2 windows in our room led to pitch black alley ways and we never had any natural lighting to get us ready to go in the morning.

The Blue Line trolley stop is just a couple of blocks away if you wanted to explore the rest of the city. Another great feature of the building is that it stands out being red and having a \"Hotel St. James\" sign lit up on top, making it easy to find in all states of sobriety or lack thereof. The lobby looks luxurious with two chandeliers hanging down and a very nice staff at the desk greeting you as you go in and head out for the day. They are also very knowledgeable on the city and will do anything for you. I called in last night actually because we ran out of toilet paper on the sixth floor and in less than 3 minutes, one of the men (I assume the door man) rushed it up to our room. Very impressive. The room we are in is two seperate rooms, which works great if you have two genders staying with each other that aren't in a relationship with each other, although there is only one bathroom that is in one of the rooms, but the bug plus is that each room has its own sink and TV with a door that can seperate the two rooms! You can also enter whatever room you would like from the hallway, which means you don't have to disturb the person sleeping in the other room when you come in after a night out! I would definitely come stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting San Diego.

The other negative is that you can't save money on food by buying from a grocery and keeping it in a refrigerator because our room doesn't have one and I'm not sure if other rooms have one either.

I had seen some negative reviews written about the Ramada and know that every business in the world has some bad reviews. Well I can tell you this, don't believe everything you read. I did my research about the area and the hotel Ramada/St. James and seen that it was in the middle of the most happening part of the Gas-Lamp district and that it was a historical landmark built in 1885 by Dr. P. C. Remondino. Read the awesome history of this hotel, copy and paste this link: http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/56april/james.htm Now for my review, I arrived at San Diego airport 10:30 am picked up my luggage at the baggage claim and called the hotel's front desk, 10 minutes later the hotel shuttle has curbside to pick me up and bring me back to the hotel, the drive was very courteous and informative to all my question about the city. Once at the hotel I was greeted by the front desk like I was a VIP. Check-in was a breeze and again I ask a million more questions about the city since it was my first time in San Diego and they informed me of all the great things in and around San Diego. Now besides the elegant lobby was the much talked about elevators that some customers complained about, but I'm sure they never read the history of them. The two polished brass doors, the fastest most state of the art elevators in the time. People traveled from all over to ride them. They worked fine for my entire stay without a glitch, and they are around 100 years old! So after the ride up to the 6th floor I arrived at my room, the room was very clean, the view was great, and yes they have WIFI and Cable TV. The maid service was also great, after each days meeting when I returned to the room it was clean and everything was in order. No room complaints here. Now talk about the best view, if you go up to the 10th floor you can access the rooftop that has seating, tables and endless views 360 degrees and great sunset. Trust me I have an album of around 100 pictures taken from the roof. The noise in the area at night was normal for any center city location so the complainers must have never stayed in a city before. The restaurant/bar connected to the hotel is Brian's 24 and let me tell you the prices and food were great, I enjoyed each meal and I had breakfast, Lunch, Dinner at Brian's 24 and they also handle the room service for the Ramada which was great even at 3am.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, CA", "Title": "\u201cLOUD !!

I had to wait about 45 minutes for the free airport shuttle when I first arrived. Then when I got to the hotel around noon, after many hours of flights across the country, I was informed a room couldn't be made available for me since the cleaning crew was taking their lunch break. When I did check in, I was surprised to have to sign a waiver basically saying I would have no expectations for quiet at night since the hotel is located in the gaslamp district, and after spending a few nights in the room, I can see why they have you sign such a waiver to say the least. The hotel's elevators are very difficult to use as you must open a heavy door and slide back a rather heavy gate each time you want to get on or off...for this reason, I would not recommend this hotel for elderly folks, those traveling with children, or anyone who has some sort of physical disability that would make this difficult--and even for someone without limitations, this was a difficult process when carrying things, etc. I found the rooms to be relatively cramped. Oddly, each bedroom had its own sink with a shared bathroom which did not have a sink. Even on full tilt, the air conditioners could not keep the room cool. The hotel staff seemed very disorganized, for example, I was out of my room for most of a day and returned after 4 pm to find my room had not been cleaned...then a cleaning lady knocked on the door to see if I wanted it cleaned, then 10 minutes later someone called to see if I wanted it cleaned, with no explanation why it hadn't been cleaned at a more typical hour. I was excited about the rooftop garden, but when I went up there to check it out I found the bar tender sunning herself on the bar with gangsta rap blaring...perhaps this is not exactly a good hotel choice for business travelers. No free breakfast available at the hotel, and I did not find many good options for a cheap and quick breakfast in the area. The hotel seems to be located in a seedier section of the gaslamp district, whenever I left the hotel early in the morning or returned later in the evening I would walk by many homeless people sleeping in doorways or going through dumpsters along the street, if you are a woman traveling alone you might feel safer elsewhere.

We arrived at 3pm and were informed that our rooms were not clean yet, but they'd be ready in about 30-40 minutes. No biggy- we left and walked to a local outdoor shopping mall and hung out there for about an hour. Walked back and were told our room wouldn't be ready for another 40 minutes. Come on! After a brief complaint, our room magically became ready. The rooms are old and small (exposed pipes, radiant heater, old tile bathroom, etc.) but I wasn't expecting anything grand- it's a historic hotel! The elevators are the old style, you open the door and pull back a sliding gate- please keep your hands inside the elevator at all times. Be prepared to wait for an available elevator for awhile, since they are very slow (I can't remember if there is only one elevator or two). The rooftop lounge area is really cool and was the best part of the hotel. Great views and there are tables and lounge chairs if you want to hang out up there. There is a decent restaurant/bar downstairs, next to the lobby. It's open 24 hours and it gets pretty busy. I walked in there with a glass coke in my hand around 4pm- just to see if I could grab a to-go menu for after the game. The bartender promptly yelled at me for walking in with a glass in my hand. Sorry! We actually got food to-go from the restaurant around 1140pm. The place was packed and I saw a drunk guy throw up onto the floor by his table. Classy. Worst customer service part of the night- my friends and I got stuck in the lobby, between the lobby floor and I'm guessing the basement level for 20 minutes! It was really hot in that elevator- as there is no ventilation. When they were finally able to free us, the guy at the front desk didn't want anything to do with us. I was not asking for a free room- but at least give us something the for inconvenience- like a restaurant coupon, a free drink, no charge for their ridiculous parking fee- anything!

The hotel does have a certain amount of charm, but mostly it is just old. The sliding metal doors on the lifts are inconvenient most of the time, and incredibly difficult with luggage. My room was a simple and small and basically conisted of a bed, desk, TV and bathroom. As it was just me this wasn't an issue although it would be extremly cramped with another person. The bathroom is quite small and old but was clean. The free in- room wifi was amazing and is what actually made me decide to book there over somewhere else. Generally it was quiet although it got loud occasionally at night as there are some pubs and clubs nearby. I checked out other booking websites (and the Ramada itself) but the cheapest rate available was with wotif.com which seems to have an all year round rate.

Only one person with luggage will fit on it at a time. The entire hotel smells - old, dirty, and musty. My room was TINY. When you opened the door, there was literally less that 3 feet until you were already at the bed. The one sink was IN the room, not in the bathroom b/c it wouldn't fit. There was a TINY stand up shower with dirty shower curtain. The hotel is very noisy and they make you SIGN a WAIVER that they will not give a refund due to loud noise. That should have been a sign to turn and run! The furnishings in the room were old and there was only one nightstand. The linens looked ancient.

Not the fact that everything that you thought of as standard in any other hotel (and even motel) would be considered a godsend here. Elevator: I have to admit I thought the elevators were so cool because they were basically pre-historic. But when you had to wait 10 mins for it to come to you, you open the door and it is stuck between two floors, or when you are squished in there with 3 other people and two pieces of luggage, there's a problem (yep that right, in this elevator 3's a crowd). Ohh did I mention that the doors are heavy as hell, so you literally have to hold the swinging door with your butt and pull the gate with you hands. I swear the folks from back in the day were straight diesel. Customer Service: OMG.. These people were OUT OF CONTROL!! I called down stairs to let them know that I wanted to take a bath, but there was no plug. They act surprised and tell me they will \"see if they can get a plug\" for me. WHAT?!?!? Are you serious? So I chill on the bed waiting for a bathtub stopper.. Tick tock, tick tock, an hour passes. I think, it's a Friday, perhaps they forgot about me because they were we so busy, so I call back. I remind them of my request, they tell me \"ohh we will send it right up\". I'm still waiting for my bathtub plug. The day I was to check out I woke up late and I wanted to get breakfast before it was time for me to go, so I called downstairs and requested to extend my check out time. The lady told me that it was no problem, we could check out at 1pm. Cool that was easy, it was the start of a great day. I come back from breakfast, full and ready to take a nap before it was time for me to drive back home. I patiently wait for the elevator, thanking god that I would only have to wait for it one more time. I get upstairs and my key card doesn't work. Hmm... that's interesting, I checked my watch it was 11:30, the original check out time is 12pm, no they wouldn't change the locks already, would they? So, we tried my friends key, nope it doesn't work. So we go and find a housekeeper, the first one, no English, she gets another one, and she didn't understand a word either. She took me to the a phone, dialed the desk and handed it to me. I have to tell them that I had to called in earlier to extend my check out time. They tell me that I have to go downstairs to get a new key. Honestly, [--]! What was the point of calling and telling them I wanted an extension if they aren't going to write it down. Not to my surprised they called the room around 12:30 to ask if we will be checking out later. Grrrr!!! Radiator/Air Conditioner: We decided to go to SD in the dead of winter, so it was chilly. Not a problem, we are staying in a 3.5 star hotel, central air and heating. NOT!!! Yeah to my surprise, there was a radiator for a heater and a window air conditioner, with paper stuffed in the cracks. I looked all over the room, for the thermostat, or on switch, but found nothing. I finally find the valve on the floor, no temperature gauge, just a valve. Once again, I have to admit that I thought turning a valve and hearing the hmm and soft rumble of the radiator was pretty cool. THAT IS, until I got supper hot in the middle of the night and wanted to it down. So I get out the bed feeling for the valve trying not to burn myself or wake my friend. I go back to bed and it's still hot. So I get up and turn off the radiator, BAD MOVE!! It RuMbLeD and GrUmBlEd and sounding like it was about to combust. My friend was startled by the incredibly loud roar of the radiator. It was ridiculous! Wow wee wow wow.. With all that said, I don't think I will be staying there again, at least not during the winter or the summer. In all it was tolerable, the rooms were clean and the decor, outside of the bathroom, was pretty new. I would suggest this place for long time couples who are just looking for a clean room.

There was evidence of prior water damage on the access panel in the ceiling. We were already in bed for the night, so chose to report it in the morning. We figured it would stop dripping once the person was done, and it did. Besides, we didn't want work crews in and out all night. When we reported it to the front desk on the way out for breakfast, we were asked if it was ok for someone to go in while we were out. No problem, we planned to be out all day. By that night, it did not appear to have been corrected, nothing was said to us by the front desk, no sign they'd even been there, nothing. After that, the woman at the front desk would see us come into the lobby and would keep her head down as we passed through, to ensure there was no eye contact. There is LOTS of street noise at night from surrounding clubs and the next room. Dare I not mention the smog that blows in through the windows which have portable a/c units in them, even in January. We blocked most of it out the second night with a bath towel, closed the lined drapes and moved furniture against them to keep it out as much as possible. I often save \"sample\" packages of shampoo, etc I receive to use during travel. I apparently had 'missed' the trash bucket when throwing it away that morning. It was still on the floor, despite the \"cleaning\" person already \"cleaning\" the room. Which means, the floor was not even swept. It left me wondering what else wasn't done. Fearing for our safety from the air quality of the room, we checked out the next day. (we booked for four nights- left after the second.)

The parking situation was terrible; there was a pay lot next door to the hotel but it's expressly NOT for hotel guests.

They were training a new hire when we checked in and we were somewhat ignored while his boss showed him the ropes of checking us in. Understandable, but a little irritating.

We had a connecting room with people we didn't know staying next door and the walls were paper thin. It takes a lot of noise to really bother me but we could hear people sniffling next door. We heard strange noises outside our door all night long, including a few instances where someone was standing directly outside our door in the middle of the night. We could see them staring at our door when we looked out the peephole. Needless to say, we didn't sleep well thinking that some weirdo was stalking us.

Parking is valet-only, at $20 per day (plus tips of course) which included in-and-out privileges. I found valet experience to be quite good and the price is reasonable for a downtown hotel. They parked the car somewhere off site and asked for a ten-minute lead time to retrieve it. That is not a long time to wait for a valet and they actually ask you to call in advance!

I always have read negative reviews of good hotels in the Gaslamp District due simply to the noise of nearby clubs and bars. Well, as I signed for the room, I had to initial by certain sentences of this little contract that where highlighted. One stuck out where the hotel pretty much said \"We are not responsible for your dissatisfaction with your room due to outside noise,\" or something close to that. Having stayed there a few times before, I honestly don't remember ever seeing that before. I didn't sweat it since there were no clubs immediately nearby, so I signed away. We go up to the room. Like anyone, I look out to see our view and it's a view of the front street, 6th street. Never had a room in the front of the hotel before. The building across was in the process of being torn down, I thought, \"Oh, great... this is why I had to sign that noise clause\" but luckily the workers had the weekend off. It wasn't till 10:45pm when we got back to the hotel that we heard the loud Jungle music coming from who knows where down stairs. We were on the 6th floor but this music was loud.

The actual taxi with tip was $15 for all three of us. Upon arriving I was told there was no management available and it would have to wait until morning.

In fact, my wife and I have agreed, the next time we come to visit SD, we will be staying at the Ramada St. James Hotel.", "Date": "November 20, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "bellingham", "Title": "\u201cBait and switch\u201d", "Author": "calvin217", "ReviewID": "UR5912756", "Content": "Stayed here for 2 nights in Sept. The rooms were OK; separate rooms separated by a door. A little small, but a nice set-up for two adult friends wanting their own bed. The hotel tried to charge a much higher rate for the second night despite their original quote (luckily we had the original internet printout). But the worst was the valet experience. Not only do they charge $18/night, but when I left my car with the valet the first night, they specifically told me the $18 was good for 24 hrs. So when I picked up the car 20 hrs later, the valets then told me that I'd be charged another $18 because the clock reset at the 2pm checkout. They were willing to bring in management; I was running late to the airport, so I didn't have time to argue, but I was pissed to say the least.

The man behind the counter was kind enough to leave the front desk un-attended as others waited to find my car and get me going. Much appreciated. I wish his superiors had thought to put more than one person at the front desk for everyone else's sake.

We had access to the rooftop which over looked the Gaslamp quarters, I believe we spent most of our nights up there. You could see the St Patty's festival and it overlooks the Petco Stadium. We absolutely enjoyed our stay there except for 2 things.... 1) the elevator....VERY VERY slow, they were once the fastest running elevator now they could be the slowest running elevators. But our group liked to be competitve so we would race up the stairs to our room on the tenth floor. And after a few drinks at their very friendly restaurant on site your oxygen level was tested :) 2) The thin doors... you could hear everything if you slept in the front room. I was actually in the back room so I heard nothing but the other members of our group couldn't sleep. Overall. stay here if you go with a group of people.

The fixtures where from 1980. The sink was cracked. We both bumped our head on the towel bar which is directly over the toilet. There was a window air conditioner resulting in air leaks into the room. It was party central in Gaslamp Quarter.
