There always seemed to be vacancy in this hotel, so for that reason we did not have much trouble parking, but if the hotel had more guests I can see how easily parking could be a problem if you were going in a massive car. The rooms at the front of the hotel are not actually ocean view, as the views are obstructed by other hotels, unless you get the King room at the top floor. Rather, the rooms at the side offer a glimpse of the ocean and the bay, if you are into watching sunrises and sunsets (though our night stay was cloudy). The hotel staff were always helpful, and offered us suggestions on places to go for dinner. The rooms are spacious and clean. I did not get to use the swimming pool nor the fitness room so I cannot comment on those, but the swimming pool is quite clean, and has a maximum depth of 4 feet.

As others have said, Carol at the front desk was very helpful and friendly. The other desk personnel seemed friendly, but when I informed the one guy that the pool was out of towels, he said he would take care of it, but new towels never appeared in the next twenty minutes we were there. Oh, the pool is REALLY small. The breakfast buffet was good, with the normal long lines for the waffle machine as to be expected at any hotel free breakfast. They kept it stocked and no complaints from me besides the wait for a waffle machine. The hotel is newer and was in good shape. The elevators were fast, and we never had to wait more than a minute for an elevator. Only a shower in our room (no tub), but it worked fine. We had a king bed and it was not comfortable at all, but the kids didn't complain about the pull-out sofa-bed. Balcony was nice, as we were on the fourth floor, side of the building, but closest room to the boardwalk. We could see the bay, as well as the ocean and boardwalk from the balcony. Air conditioning controls are wall mounted, which is much better than the older units with the controls on the air conditioner. The parking spots were really tight and people with larger vehicles had difficulty getting in/out of the parking spots. With everything so close, we didn't have to drive much, so it wasn't that big of a problem for us. Location is the real reason to stay here. Cross the super-busy street in front of the hotel, and you're a two minute walk away from the boardwalk. Crossing that super-busy street is a real pain though.... We were there on a Tuesday and the beach fireworks were literally across the street from the hotel, and I could have watched them from our balcony. If you're coming back from the beach, there's a garden hose on the left side of the hotel behind the side entrance, where you can wash off your beach sand. I didn't see it documented anywhere, but found it when walking back from the parking lot after using the stairs. I didn't notice any bad smells in the hotel like some other reviewers noted.

Um, yeah, more on that later. First, the good points. Location, location, location. Walk out the front door, across the street, up 1 block and you are on the boardwalk at 1st street. Right in the heart of it all. The room itself was nice, with 2 beds, a chair, a desk, TV, and nice bathroom. Bathroom sink had granite countertop and shower had granite surround. Water pressure was good and the temperature consistent. Was a little surprised that they don't have flat screen HDTV yet but what they had worked well. Each room had a little balcony with chairs and table. Pool was small but nice, water was warm. The hotel offered a free breakfast each morning, free coffee all day in the next door bistro, and free internet access. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Now the bad. The beds were pretty hard, and the \"pillow top\" was nothing more than a thin layer of padding under the sheet - nowhere near a true pillow top. The balconies are nice, but the doors and windows are not very sound resistant, so if your neighbors are out, you WILL hear them. The AC did not work right, I started the thermostat at 70 then dropped to 68, but the room temp never got below 72. The wired internet worked well, but the wireless stunk. We were on 3rd floor (out of 5) and the only place I could maintain a wireless signal was in the bathroom! Internet access required a passcode which wasn't readily available in the room and when I tried to call the front desk to get it, the phone didn't work. Parking. There are plenty of spots, but the lot is VERY TIGHT. I highly recommend driving a small car if you are staying here. We had nights with a full size pickup and/or an Escalade in the lot, and it was very hard to get through. Getting into and out of spots was difficult because people parked however and wherever they wanted, and hotel staff did not seem to mind. Cars were parked across 2 spots, were parked 2 feet back from the parking block, etc. Check your car daily for dings and scratches cuz there's a good chance you'll get one. By far, the worst experience was with housekeeping. We checked in Saturday and everything was fine. On Sunday, we were out of the room from 11 until 1:30 pm, then came back long enough to shower and change, then were out again from 2:15 until 8 pm. Room never got cleaned. Had to call front desk to get clean towels, more shampoo, etc. On Monday, we were out of the room starting at 10:45 and popped back in off and on from 2 until 3:30 and the room hadn't been cleaned yet. FInally we came back a little after 4 and it was done, but the housekeeping crew had taken our toothpaste. Since we were leaving the next day we got a couple of ready to use toothbrushes from the front desk, otherwise we would have had to go buy toothpaste. All in all it was an OK stay, the front desk was very responsive to the issues. I've just never stayed anywhere with that poor of housekeeping services.

It was our first time in Ocean City and definitely won't be the last. We had an awesome time. First of all, the location is perfect. Two blocks from the boardwalk and beach, it is in the middle of all the fun. There are ice cream shops, restaurants, drugstores, bike rentals, and lots of souvenir shops all within a 5 minute drive or less. I highly recommend On the Bay Seafood for succulent, delicious crab and OC Swirl for healthy tart frozen yogurt. Despite being so close to the action, this hotel was far enough away that it was very quiet. Second, the rooms (we had three) were all immaculately clean. Our rooms all had king beds and they were soft and very comfortable. There is a coffee maker in the bathroom, a table and chairs on the terrace, and a TV with plenty of channels. The TV is a bit old but it was big enough and worked fine. Third, the breakfast is awesome. There was a huge assortment. There's a waffle station, two different types of cereal, sausages, toast, fruits, hard-boiled eggs, and low-fat yogurt. For a free breakfast, this is more than what we expected. The hours are from 7-10 am, which I think is quite generous. They even kept it open a little later (until 10:15 or so) for stragglers to pick up some coffee and muffins. Fourth, the staff is awesome. They were kind, professional, and courteous. I originally booked a one night stay but then we decided to stay two nights. The prices online had increased by then so I called the hotel to press my luck. Not only did the woman (Carol) give me the online price ($190 instead of $200+) she also made it so that we wouldn't have to move to a different room (on account of technically having two separate reservations). We celebrated my dad's birthday a bit early and got him a gift. We forgot the wrapping paper and tape so I went to the front desk and grabbed some newspaper and the young man provided tape. Fifth, parking is plentiful and free. Not sure if free parking is the norm around these parts since this was our first time, but this isn't the case in many other areas so I did appreciate this. I'm usually hesitant to book hotels around beach areas. They are usually overpriced, dirty, and run-down. Not so with this establishment. Don't hesitate to pull the trigger and book.

The water from both the tub faucet and shower head barely dribbled out. It literally took about 45 minutes to fill the tub up 1/2 way!! Next we noticed that the items we put in the mini fridge were still warm, despite being in the fridge for an hour. I went to the front desk to notify them that the fridge was not working. Someone came up about 3hrs later to look at it. The gentleman said that the fridge was not working and would be replaced the next morning. Saturday morning arrives, and after breakfast my youngest child bumped against the door, before we were able to slide the room key card, the door opened. Thinking I had not shut it tight, I firmly pulled it shut and I bumped against it to see if it would open. It did!! We had slept the entire night in the room with a door that did not lock! Then we noticed the tall lamp in the room which was turned on, started to smoke. I unplugged it right away, and went to the front desk to tell them about the door not locking and the lamp smoking. The youngman at the counter told me to \" just put the lamp on the balcony, we'll look at it later\". Sometime later that evening the door was fixed, the fridge was plugged back in and we were told \"it was fixed\" (it wasn't) the issue with the lamp never was never addressed. I noticed that we were just about out of toilet paper and asked a member of house keeping for more, when I was told that it was hotel policy that only one roll is given to each room for a weekend.

I know that Ocean City hotels charge exorbitant rates for less than average accommodations for the most part, so a brand new chain hotel should be a refreshing change, we thought. Pros: NO BEDBUGS! First thing I did was lift up the sheets and inspect the mattress. NOTHING! Plus the sheets were exceptionally clean and crisp. Bed and pillows were comfortable as well. Overall, room was quite clean, save a few things mentioned in cons. GREAT location! Only a block off the boardwalk. Close to Sunfest (the reason for our weekend say) and a block from the carribean bar (so not far to stumble back! :-) ) Free on-site parking. Other have mentioned how small the spaces are. We had no problem putting the Jeep Wrangler in a covered spot (and leaving it there all weekend!). Plenty of spaces on-site to be had as well, unlike other hotels which have lots which are a block or two away. Cons: Walked in about three hourse before check-in. We did not expect to get into our room and merely wanted to let them know we were there and whether we needed a parking pass. The foreign gentlemen who came out of the office took my name and merely stated \"come back at 3\" Ok, no problem, but do we need a parking pass? \"No just come back at 3.\" Great way to start the weekend?!?! We are AAA members. Therefore, our room is guaranteed until 7:00 a.m. the next day and only THEN should our card be charged. I got a call at 1:00 p.m. from Carol at the front desk asking if we were planning to come because \"your card had not gone through and when that happens, people do not usually show up.\" Well, Carol, I was already there and informed your co-worker that I was there, so clearly Mr. Friendly did not impart that information. Also, the card I used has a low limit and was NOT TO BE CHARGED unless I did not show up. Ok, 3:00 p.m. comes, another gentleman at the front desk was exceptionally polite and friendly. Checked us in without problem or wait and up to the room we went. Overall, the room is large (king bed suite) and clean, save a few stray hairs behind the bathroom room from prior guest. Also, the floor of the shower stall could have used a good scrubbing and some bleach. The air conditioner needed re-set when we got there, which we did and it worked until sometime around midnight, when we could barely get it to pump out any cool air (and it was in the low 90's all weekend in OC). Also, was very disappointed in the free breakfast. Other chains will offer a few hot items or some hard boiled eggs. This breakfast consisted of juice, coffee, bread, mini muffins, some fruit, yogurt and cereal. The breakfast area was very clean and all items were fully stocked, but to keep up with other national chains, Sleep Inn should bump it up a bit. Overall, a totally average stay.

I did my research and although there are some bad reviews on this site, most of them were positive so I felt pretty good making the reservation. I should have listened to the bad reviews. Pros: 1) Location is good if you want to be where all the action is i.e. boardwalk, near the inlet, etc. 2) If you can get a clean room (a big if), then the price isn't bad 3) The management did respond to some of my complaints which I will list below, but in my experience, it depends on who you get at the front desk Cons: 1) they wouldn't let us check in until 3 pm on the nose. This isn't that big of a deal except their reason was the cleaning crew only had from 11 - 3 to clean all of the rooms. This isn't true because not everyone checks out on the same day, therefore, they have time to clean rooms before 11 and after 3. Also, if they clean a room at 11 and get done at 12, that room is available and the front staff just doesn't want to be bothered figuring out which rooms are done for the convenience of their new guests 2) the parking lot is very tight - not just the width but the length, so larger cars and trucks were sticking out making it tight to manuever 3) the first thing that hit us in the room was a bad odor that was partially masked by some kind of spray, which made it worse. We realized later that this was partially due to the previous guest who used the microwave and the cleaning crew didn't clean it. It had a bunch of melted butter/grease that was clearly part of some seafood that was in there. It was gross. 4) we booked a 1 room king suite which is really just a big room with a couch and table. They also gave us a room that had a view of the bay (not the ocean) and the tiny pool (which was cold). Plus our room was on the side with the SMALL balancy's. They were so tiny they are almost pointless and ours had no tiny plastic chairs like the other ones did. We called the front desk and asked for 1 and some more towels, and 50 minutes later had to call again. They brought the towels but forgot the chair, but we finally got 1. - we were in room 423 on the 4th floor 5 the sofabed still had the previous guests sheets and blankets on it. When I took them off, there was spots of blood on the mattress. Not a lot of blood, but any blood is bad, don't you think? When I told the front desk, they gave me a new mattress pad to put on it. Um, that helped, but I think a new mattress or a new room would have been better. 6)when the cleaning crew came to clean our room, they didn't make up the sofa bed nor did they vacuum! They only made our bed and restocked our towels. They missed restocking the tissues which was just annoying after all the other problems. 7)the exercise room was very hot when I walked into it, and like another person posted in their review, only 1 of the 3 machines was working. They claimed somone stole the cables, but how hard is it to order new ones. Plus there were no cups for the water jug. If were staying longer than 2 nights, I would have demanded a new room (although they told me they were full) or checked out. In any case, during checkout, the manager on duty gave us a 20% discount for the problems. This helped, but did not wash away our bad experience. He said that they recently had some staff issues (specifically on the 4th floor btw) and they are trying to fix them, but there were so many issues it's hard to overlook them. My advice is to pay a little extra and get the prepay rates at the new Marriott only a few blocks down which is oceanfront btw.", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cClean place in good location - a MUST stay if your 1st time in Ocean City MD\u201d", "Author": "chochrei", "ReviewID": "UR77246084", "Content": "Had friends going to Ocean City who invited us to come along, we had never been there and while looking for hotels I got a little concerned with some of the reviews.

The house keeping staff is equally distant, mainly because they see like they are from Russia, or like points. In room internet is also a myth. WiFi is available in the lobby (1 computer) and you need a desk cable for the room, if available. We couldnt get it to connect. There is also a lack of quality restaurants in walking distance of the hotel.

The hotel is immaculate. Rooms were large and clean. We did not have a bathtub in our room, not sure if this is the same for all rooms. Beds were comfy. We had a fridge, microwave, iron/ironing board, soaps and shampoos but no safe. We had a decent size balcony with a small table. We were able to see the beach from our balcony. There is also a laundry room if you need. No WiFi in rooms as others have stated as well. Free breakfast in the morning was nice (7am-10am). They had juices, coffee, toast, bagels, cereals, and some fruits. Not tons of food but can't complain, it was free! Seating was hit or miss though. One day we couldn't find a table, the next day it was completely empty (at about the same time 9am). Rates were very affordable for the location. We were only a block to the beach and extremely close to the amusement rides on the pier and Trimpers. Baltimore Ave is a little tough to cross with all the traffic. We found it a little easier to walk a block to the left or right to cross at the lights. Parking was tight (short, tight spaces - good luck parking an SUV) but ample. There were even a few covered spots under the hotel. We didn't use the pool so can't comment on that. This is such a pleasant addition to Ocean City where even the most run-down dumps are $300 a night. We will definitely stay here again when in the area and would without a doubt recommend to family and friends.

Hotel is in new condition. Contrary to other reviewers, hotel front desk was very helpful...didn't experience any rudeness at all. Hotel is a block from the boardwalk, situated on busy Baltimore Ave, right past Rte 50. Parking at the hotel is off-street and tight (spaces are small); would recommend bringing a compact car if you have one, We saw plenty of people with larger vehicles, however. Hotel is situated at the more interesting end of the boardwalk, near all of the carnival rides, fishing pier, and tourist trap stores/snack stands. Our room was on the 5th floor, and still smelled new. Was very clean with small balcony. Hotel is L-shaped and our room faced the the inside of the hotel/pool (not beach/boardwalk), which wasn't bad because it buffered the noise from the bikers on Baltimore Ave all night long. Hotel bathroom was nice with granite on counters/shower surround. Hotel breakfast was typical continental fare...juices/coffee, cereal, bagels, and muffins. There was no restaurant/bar, however it appeared that they were in the process of building a cafe on the first floor. There are so many different restaurants/bars/clubs in OC...no reason to eat at at the Sleep Inn, anyway. Compared to some of the trashy motels around OC, this was a pleasant surprise. If you can't get a room at the Hilton, and don't mind being off the beach by one block, this is not a bad alternative.

I agree with the previous reviewer, it appeared that many of the older moderately priced hotels were not well-maintained.
