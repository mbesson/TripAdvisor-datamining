Without any other choice we left our bags on the rack and hoped for the best. When our travel agent booked this hotel we were under the impression that breakfast was included, but it was an extra 5 pounds. We paid it just to keep the peace. We came back to the hotel that evening to find our bags under a pile of other peoples bags, after digging them out and checking in we were given the key to our \"room\".... I would prefer to it as a cupboard with an en-suite. The bed barely fit in the room, which left us no choice but to leave our bags in the only open space of floor, which happened to block the door. In the bathroom the water pressure was dodgy and the temperature hard to control. I expected the small size, but what really freaked me out about the bathroom was the toilet seat. It was a clear acrylic seat with shells in it, so it made me think i was about to sit on spiky shells... I was pretty tired by the time I got to use the toilet, after stepping off a 24 hour flight that morning then walking for 8 hours around London, so my reaction was probably a little bit over the top, however it did continue to annoy me for the rest of the stay. The bed was pretty uncomfortable and small and the pillows were flat. There was also no additional pillows or blankets. The breakfast was ridiculous. For 5 pounds you got to help your self to toast and got served a plate of baked beans, an egg and some sausage and was labeled a \"full English breakfast\". After breakfast we went back to the reception area and got our 5 pounds back each for the next morning.... we would rather buy maccas then eating that again. We never found any of the staff overly helpful or interested in us as their customers. They barely looked up when we entered and asked them questions and talked in a bored tone of voice. All though I was not impressed with this hotel at all, it did come to 2 good things... 1: I learned to always book my own accommodation now based on reviews on this website and 2: because we hated the hotel we spent so much time out exploring London, not sleeping off our jet-lag.

Was not allowed a spare key even though there was 4 of us. We had a hard time with one ot the locks. The trolley with cleaning materials and towels etc. stayed outside my room 256 all night. My pals stayed in room 208 and there was not even a number on the door. Because the door had two glass panes, one friend could not sleep all night due to the light shining in his eyes all night. They would not let me have a late check out, but let me store my bag in the bar area unlocked and unattended.", "Date": "April 25, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Highbridge, Somerset", "Title": "\u201cWill be using this hotel again\u201d", "Author": "Somersetyid", "ReviewID": "UR7349690", "Content": "Firstly i will say, although i agree with some of the comments made about the hotel, like the shower head being in need of de-scaling and the blinds not being able to roll up, i have to say that my room was clean enough. Also i think that most people using a hotel of this style only need somewhere to get their heads down at night, not somewhere to stay for hours on end, i couldnt wait to get out and hit London. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and as far as i saw they could all speak very good English!! I will certainly be using this hotel again when staying in London.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel quality/price\u201d", "Author": "Simone73", "ReviewID": "UR6447833", "Content": "The Hotel was clean and the staff very nice and helpful.
