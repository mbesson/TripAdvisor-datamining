If you decide to book this hotel in order to visit Venice you should know a couple of things about commuting to Venice and back beforehand. There is a train station (Ve. Mestre Ospedale) close to the hotel and from there you can catch a direct train to the Venice Santa Lucia train station for as low as 2.5 euro for the a round trip. The reception stuff was very helpfull to assist as in finding the train station and they aslo gave as a paper with the train and buses timetables. That was very convenient. Just note that in Ve. Mestre Ospedale train station you will not find an automatic ticket vending machine so you should buy tickets before going to the station or board in the first vagon and buy them directly from the train stuff.

We thought we had a steal until we got there. The guide from the hotel website of reaching from the airport was vague and confusing. We arrived at the Venice airport at 10:30pm and had trouble finding a shuttle that would take us to Mestre, which claims to be 15 mins away. The shuttle was 5EUR and took about half an hour which only took us to the Mestre train station. We decided it was too scary to venture so we took a cab, which we were sure we were taken advantage of because it took another 15 mins and cost 28EUR. Cabs in Venice starts at 7.95 EUR by the way. It was a nice surprise once we got there - modern clean designs, wide open concepts and check-in went with little hiccups. Diego was extremely rude but everyone else we encountered were friendly and helpful. Wireless works on the 9th floor (gym/pool/lounge) and lobby at 1EUR for the day. Rooms were new and shiny and clean. Everything was better in the morning, we walked 15 mins to the near by suburban shopping mall with a huge supermarket within it. The bus to Venice is located AT the mall, not outside the hotel, which we didn't find out because the staff didn't clarify, so we had to go back and forth for a bit. The tickets had to be purchased at a cigar shop/cafe, and it is only 1.50 EUR to head to Piazza Roma in Venice. Breakfast was ok, a good spread but nothing amazing, fills you up for a long day ahead though. A lot of Asian tour groups were staying there, so a good idea is to probably get breakfast before 7am to avoid that huge influx of people. The rooftop \"pool\" was probably 3 bathtubs big but the decor was very nice, with comfortable lounge chairs all around. This is definitely not a \"relaxing\" hotel but more of an \"overnight before Venice\" kind of hotel. Most people here are on tour groups or on their way into Venice for a cruise. Overall, although the rooms are nice, I would recommend staying at a lower star rating hotel withIN Venice rather than going through all that trouble to get here.

We discovered the loss/theft soon after we left the hotel and were ready to board a cruise ship. We concluded that the money could only have been stolen while my wife left her handbag at the hotel on two occasions, as all the credit cards etc were intact in the wallet in the handbag, and the handbag was with her all the time after we left the hotel. We quickly reported the theft to the security staff at Venice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sea port and (following advice from them) later formally to the police in Bari when we moored the following day. We called the hotel manager as soon as we came back to London and submitted all the evidence (including the declaration to the police).

I dont agree with previous comments about a ' industrial estate' its a modern built up area which is a total contrast of the fairy tale venice but i wouldnt say it was bad. There is a shopping centre over the road with food and shops. also a train station which goes direct to venice in 10 mins. The Hotel was extremly clean and modern. There was free internet a pool and gym. The pool was small and un swimable but it was still pleasent to sit on the roof top or relax in the hot sun in the pool. The restaurant and bar were beautiful with modern seating and lovely food and drinks offerd. Our room was cleaned daily and beds changed and made. We experience no loud noise or bad experiences what so ever, I would reccomend this hotel maybee to the younger generation as its modern and a total contrast to venice but me and my partner found it nice to have the normality of a normal holiday destination in italy or the magical city of venice. The only 1 problem is that you had to return from venice at 12 am as that was the last train but other than that A* There is no air port transportation direct however ryan air offer a shuttle from treviso airport to mestre for about 5 euro return.

The bus stop is pretty much right outside the door from the hotel and runs from early in the morning (7AM?) to approximately 7PM. There are other options other than bus directly from Venice to the hotel, but this is by far the most convenient and economical (2.50 each way!) The rooms and lobby were very modern and look to have been recently renovated.

There is also a restaurant near the lobby, which we ate at on our last night, which was average when compared to the great city food, but was pretty much the only option in the area.

Like the title indicates, the hotel was just average. There was no \"wow factor\" to it, nor was it bad. Location: As with many airport hotels, this hotel was located in a quiet area, on the outskirts of Mestre. This being said, there is nothing in the vicinity of great interest. However, there is a small strip mall (Auchan) located nearby (~10 minute walking distance). The mall includes a supermarket that is very Walmart-esque. There you will find everything from booze, to toiletries, to even electronics. Room: The room (and hotel itself) was very clean and modern. Although the room was a bit on the small side, it served it's purpose if you're looking for a comfortable place to lay your head. Service: The service was, again, nothing special. When we arrived late at night, we were barely greeted at the check-in desk by a gentleman named 'Diego'. Although he was not rude with us, it almost seemed as if he was doing us a favour and that we were a nuisance to him. Aside from that, we didn't really encounter any other hotel staff members. The breakfast buffet that was included in our package was, again, just fine. Dishes and cutlery were clean, the food was plentiful and there was room to find and sit at a table without bumping into another table. Nothing to write home about, yet nothing to complain about.

The beds are incredibly comfortable and because you are in the middle of nowhere it is very quiet at night. The service was also quite good.

This ofcourse would not be a problem if the time we spent in the hotel was spent in Venice as intended, however the hotel itself is located a fourty minute bus ride from the city, this bus ride will only take you to the very edge of the city. And unless you want to catch a diffrent bus back which does not drop you off outside your hotel (which makes getting very lost very, very easy) then you will have to depart from venice sharp at 6.55pm. Leaving very little time for anybody who does not leave there hotel before miday. The city centre (st. marcs square) about 2 hours traveling from the hotel itself. Depending on how quick your legs are capable of. My advice is not to stay in this hotel unless your on business and like to sleep in early afternoon hours. Otherwise, you are wasting your time!", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "gent", "Title": "\u201cperfect hotel : clean, modern, friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere\u201d", "Author": "verheuen", "ReviewID": "UR91931047", "Content": "Though we read the negative comments on this hotel, we booked a room for 4 nights and we were very very pleased with it.

How did I dislike thee? Let me count the ways... 1. It was practically impossible to bathe because of all the bathroom flaws. Let's start with the shower: it is one of those handheld shower wands with jets that stream from the side of the wand. This would not have been a problem had the container for holding the wand in place to shower not been broken, meaning if you weren't holding the wand in your hand there was nowhere to place it in the tub without shooting water everywhere. This also became a safety issue in that there was no bathmat, nor were there any slipguard strips placed in the tub. In addition, the hot and cold water mixer was broken, meaning there was either scalding water or freezing water...take your pick! It took a few times of laying down the shower wand and therefore spraying water all over the place while fiddling with the water temperature to figure this out. OK, no problem we thought - we'll take a bath instead. Only problem there was that the stopper was also broken, making a bath impossible as well. Well, we'll just take a \"birdbath\" in the sink then. Guess what? No stopper in the sink either. In fact, the only amenities given to us were a bottle of lotion and a bottle of shampoo. No soap. No conditioner. No showercap. NO WASHCLOTHS. Not even a box of Kleenex! As I said, bathing was impossible. 2. Entry into the room was also dicey. They have the standard electronic keycard system; unfortunately, the device where one waves the card is on the wall next to the door, and by the time you got your card away from the device and into the cardkey slot on the door, it had reset. It took us 14+ swipes to open the door...every single time we needed to get in the room.. 3. Breakfast was horrid. I mean WORST. FOOD. EVER. Unless you enjoy powdered eggs, raw bacon, canned fruit, stale croissants, \"juice\" that was a Tang-like powdered mix, and the worst, most undrinkable coffee ever brewed complete with powdered creamer, you are better off going hungry and eating later. Come on guys, this is ITALY, renowned the world over for wonderful food, and you're serving this junk??? Disgraceful. And about the dining room: how do you say \"we don't like you - no comfort for you!\" Put a prickly cactus on each table for an elegant accent, salt and pepper in individual packets (like the kind you find in a fast food establishment) instead of in shakers and have all the tables face a courtyard barren of anything except huge boulders. If they were going for a moonscape look, they nailed it. The B4 has the temerity to describe themselves as a 4 star hotel, and to be fair it was a very clean hotel, with several nice touches: a towel warmer, sturdy clothes hangers, comfortable beds and very reasonable internet charges; but given the litany of problems I listed above, I believe the overall conditions say that they don't think much of the guests they are there to serve.", "Date": "December 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane Australia", "Title": "\u201cVery clean and modern hotel\u201d", "Author": "Nellie77", "ReviewID": "UR84838348", "Content": "This is a very new and modern hotel.

Dinner was very basic but quite enjoyable. Breakfast was another matter. Several groups descended on the breakfast room at the same time and there was just not enough food to cater for the number of guests. When items ran out, they did not seem to be replenished very promptly, if at all, and the staff seemed unable to cope with the influx. It's not like they didn't know in advance how many guests would be at breakfast! The location was quite a way out of Venice in what seemed like an industrial neighbourhood with not many facilities close by. However this wasn't a problem for us as we were on a tour and were transported everywhere on our coach.
