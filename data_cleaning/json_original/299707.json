( Novotel is at the back of IBIS).. we know that Dubai is a safe place, however, the parking area they were referring to is way too far... it was summer that time, so imagine the distance + heat in the afternoon... i complained (if there was an event that they are aware of which results to the inconvenience of people who need to park at the vicinity of their hotel they should have included a disclaimer on their website, mentioning the dates of unavailability of their facilities, etc) and was about to cancel my reservation right then and there as they were insisting for us to take the parking they were referring to.. to avoid this.... the manager said he can arrange for us to park at Novotel and so we parked at Novotel. still not that convenient but at least we felt more safe there. Our room was ok, very basic but clean there were no safety deposit box, but i think you can inquire from the reception if you have something to safekeep. I believe each floor has got a vendo machine for water/soda/snacks which is convenient if you forgot to buy water at the grocery. at the price we paid, it was nice to have breakfast for 2.... if you will not be staying in the hotel the whole day or most of your time while you're in Dubai... this hotel is relatively ok. it will be best to book online as it is much cheaper than walk-in booking... =)", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Hague", "Title": "\u201cIbis WTC Dubai\u201d", "Author": "Posted by an Accorhotels.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR120411759", "Content": "I was there in connection with the IBA Conference.

The only parking available is in a multi storey car park which i was told was directly accessible from the hotel. It turns out this isn't true and it's actually about a 10 minute walk through the adjacent exhibition centre. I asked if there was anyone to help me as I had heavy bags and it was after midnight so I wasn't thrilled about walking around a multi-storey alone but i was told that no help was availabe. After trekking theough the exhibition centre with my bags i got to my room which was almost identical to the room i had in halls of residence when i was a student. The decor, dark wood and especially the carpets, were old fashioned and depressing. As it was 1am I was hoping for room service but the phone in the room didn't work. I had to go back down to reception to ask for a large bottle of water and an orange juice. I was first told to use the vending machine on my floor. I said that I wanted a large bottle and I was told to go into the bar if I wanted these. When I objected on the grounds that I wouldn't have been asked to go to the bar had my phone have been working the staff sighed at me and huffily went to get me something. I think to send a lone woman into a bar at 1am in the morning to buy water was wholly inappropriate and I can guarantee that an Emirati woman would not have been asked to do this.

Inexpensive room rate with good facilities. Plenty of taxis outside all hours of the day. Several coffee shops and restraints all within just a minute walk of the lobby. The lobby is very modern, clean and spacious with plenty of seating and free WIFI (ask at reception for password) or computer access. It also boasts a small shop, outside garden seating / smoking area and access to the bars and eateries. Two elevators give access to all floors including the creche on the first floor. The whole hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly and happy to help. The cleaning staff are also very welcoming and always greet you very politely. The rooms are a moderate size but don't expect anything too large. No hair dryer or tea / coffee making facilities in the rooms. Don't expect anything special from the room window views either. For what you pay you get a very comfy and large bed, very clean rooms, air con and basic bathroom facilities with sink, large mirror, toilet and shower cubicle. Our shower did however badly leak all over the floor and the problem was not fixed even after telling reception. The shower was also very poor and was impossible to keep at a constant good temperature. The reception desk staff are generally helpful and can offer much advise about the local area and also sell tickets for many tours and excursions. Breakfast is served at the CUBO resterant. It's a mix of European continental and a small selection of \"hot\" food that is slightly more local. The hot selection changes each morning and includes sausage, pancakes, turkey bacon etc. Unfortunately the \"hot\" food was never even warm and really let a what would of been a good breakfast down. There was still a big choice of pasteries, toast, fruit, meat, yoghurt and much more. By afternoon / evening the CUBO becomes an Italian resteraunt that serves great food and on a thursday evening has an all you can eat buffet with unlimited drinks (Inc. Alcohol) The other bar in the hotel offers live sports on tv with a good selection of drinks (but is more expensive than the other official \"hotel bar\"), music and a wide menu of food also avaliable. The hotel does not have a pool or gym facilities however guests may use the Novotel's facilities (which is just around the corner about a 4 min walk and the facilities are very good!).

They kept on saying ' the hotel has no parking' to whatever car based question I posed, but were unable to offer any suggestions on how to solve this problem. Eventually we got to speak to someone more knowledgable who directed us to some free parking. It is worth saying that the directions were incorrect and that without sat-nav we would have been totally screwed. The parking was free but 10 minutes walk in blistering heat back to the hotel. From the moment we first arrived to actually getting to the room this whole debacle had taken an hour! The lack of local knowledge and language skills impacted us not long after. We asked if the metro was open and were told yes. We then asked if there was a station nearby and were told yes. We then asked for directions. The directions were poor and made no mention of there being no pavement and a large highway in the way that was virtually imposible to cross.

Arriving late (or early) at about 4AM in the morning, reception staff was able to welcome me by name, as there were basically no other guests arriving or around in the lobby. I visited Dubai mainly for sightseeing and to check, whether a longer second trip with friends would be worthwhile. LOCATION The hotel forms part of the convention centre and allows for direct access to the centre through the lobby. Sheikh Zayed Road stretches out behind a block of apartments (World Trade Centre Apartments, if you go to the front of the apartments, there is a small supermarket). The World Trade Centre Metro station will be within walking distance of the hotel once it is opened to the public. Right now, the Financial Centre station is the nearest operational one. Being somebody who rather walks some minutes instead of taking public transport or taxis, I had to change this behaviour in Dubai, as pedestrians seem not to be part of road planning. Speaking of taxis, there are not always taxis waiting outside the hotel, so one might bear that in mind. I did write down some costs for taxi rides (might vary, but for some reference): Airport (terminal 1) - Ibis: 37AED Ibis - Bur Dubai near Ministry of Finance: 25AED Ibis - The Address hotel (near Burj Dubai, Dubai Mall): 15AED Ibis - Emirates Towers: 10AED (minimum fare) Ibis - Jumeirah Beach Hotel: 37AED Financial Centre Metro station - trade centre (2mins from hotel): 10AED (minimum fare) HOTEL / ROOMS The hotel looks quite new from the outside. However, the interior and the romms show some use and abuse. As mentioned above, staff was very friendly and helpful (especially at the reception). I had breakfast at the hotel once (55AED, buffett style), which I found to be enough for my eating habits. The standard food was avalable: scrambled eggs, sausages, choice of bread, rolls and toast, some pastries, cereals, joghurts and fruit. The drink section featured apple and orange juice, milk, choice of tea and choice of coffee-based beverages. The breakfast area is not too large and might get a bit crowded at some times. There was also a limited \"early bird\" breakfast available in the lobby for 25AED. I can't comment on the restaurant, as I did eat out in the evenings. A hint regarding water: There is a machine selling bottles (0,5l) of cold still water for only 1AED (coins required!) on every floor. The room (637 in my case) was large enough for one person, but seemed to be a regular double room for single use. Please refer to the pictures for more details on the general look. The regular TV set (I spotted Arabic, English, French and German channels) and telephone were all there, but e.g. no hairdryer or safe. The bathroom was quite small and showed some signs of usage. Towels were provided of course, but not regularly changed during my stay, even with one towel being really dirty upon arrival. This also was the major flaw of the hotel during my stay: the bathroom was not properly cleaned and the shower head had to be used quite carefully to not fully destroy its mount. Additionally, the shower basin did leak, requiring at least one towel on the floor to prevent flooding. VERDICT All in all my stay at the Ibis WTC was not too bad considering the rate (399AED/night) and the fact that I did only stay in my room to sleep and shower. However, given the flaws regarding that last part, I might look for another hotel for my next stay in Dubai, probably one being located near Old Town / Burj Dubai for expanded dining opportunities.

The rooms are small, and the bathroom is quite cramped, but usable. I found the beds to be moderately uncomfortable. My biggest gripe with this hotel is the service. While I wouldn't expect over the top service for a hotel in this price range, the front desk staff are rude and unhelpful, and appeared annoyed when asked the most benign questions. Unfortunately this held true for all four desk clerks with whom I interacted. In my student days I also worked as a hotel desk clerk, and I know what a challenge the job can be, but this was unacceptable. When asked (on a Friday) where a certain item might be purchased, we were advised to go to shops in a specific area of Dubai - however no mention was made that all shops are closed on Fridays - we took a cab there only to find that nothing would be open for 2 days. When asked about exchanging money, we were given misinformation and advised to utilize the hotel exchange at poorer rates. And when our travel plans were disrupted and we found ourselves needing to stay an extra day, our rate suddenly went up significantly. As this is their perogative and we didn't wish to traipse around locating additional lodging, we paid it, but it is poor customer service. And the breakfast originally included in our stay suddenly was no longer available. Internet service is about $30 USD for 24 hours and is relatively slow (although not the worst that we have run into in hotels in this region). The location is convenient if you have meetings at the World Trade Center, but otherwise the hotel is not particularly well located for a visitor - it is far from any amenities, leaving you at the mercy of the hotel restaurant (mediocre at best) and what little is offered in the hotel gift shop. If you are traveling for business and it's location suits you, then it is clean and inexpensive, and likely adequate. If you are traveling as a tourist, I would recommend finding something located in Deira for local atmosphere and convenience to the Souks and areas of Bur Dubai, or else somewhere along the coast for a more resort-feel.

The taxi charged us AED 44. Depending on tariff, the hotel gives u free drop & pick up from the airport.

Being a business area, there are no shops for groceries, toiletories, snacks or cold drinks. No restaurants except ones in the hotels. There is no light life in this area. Description : The hotel is located next to the WTC. Its very useful for conferences in WTC. We paid Rs.11500 ~ AED 884 ( 2 people 4D/3N with breakfast) during the July heat. The lobby is good. There is minimal service given. You carry own luggage to the rooms. Drinking water can be bought thru a dispenser on each floor. You can collect ice from the bar for free. Non veg breakfast is good. There is minimal choice for vegetarians. The swimming pool is chargeable & is shared with the adjoining hotel. Could not find the gym but it is also shared. The safe box is at the lobby. The rooms are small , compact & functional. The TV channels cater to the European customer & not much choice for Asians. The hotel staff helped us with recommending places & gave accesories like electric adapters for our chargers. ( They use the square sockets) Taxis keep plying around the area but its better to have a contact / book a taxi in advance & not depend on one to just pass by. Recommended for Business Traveller.

For me I will rate Ibis World Trade Center as (0.5*-1*) , what do you think?", "Date": "July 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cgreat value, clean, convenient\u201d", "Author": "segenet", "ReviewID": "UR8087114", "Content": "great for a short stay, very good value compared to other hotels for the same price in Dubai.

Probably the cheapest you can get for this part of town and it is in a more favourable than Deira, particulalry if you are likely to spend more time in the Jumerirah beach resorts. A bus service collects from the airport hourly. However, I did not use it because a friend picked me up. It is worthwhile using because taxi journeys from the airport carry a special surcharge (20Dhs = \u00a33). Journey time is about 10-15 minutes depending on traffic. Nice clean lobby area at the hotel with sofas and coffee tables for loafing around. Three internet terminals are available but not many people use it, probably because of the cost (was 24Dhs=\u00a33.50 for 20 minutes or 72Dhs=\u00a310 for 1 hour). Not sure what the price was for wireless. Room was clean though starting to get a bit scuffy. Shower leaked a bit but it wasn't much of a problem. Air conditioning very effective. The only disappointments were the lack of tea/coffee making facilities and the lack of English TV channels (a news channel sould have been nice). There's a small bar which is fairly busy and open 24-7. I only used it once and the prices seemed reasonable. Snacks are ordered here (sandwiches/fries etc). The Italian restaurant next door closes at midnight and I'm told it is reasonably good. A cafe is located a short walk inside the adjacnt convention centre and serves coffees and pre-prepared sandwiches and cakes etc.. There's a small shop with post cards, maps, books, magazines. I bought a map there which was quite expensive. Breakfast in the hotel is buffet style and nothing spectacular. A choice of three cereals (cornflakes, museli or all bran), selection of yoghurts, fresh fruit salad, croissants, white and brown bread toast, fresh orange and apple juice, tea and coffee, cold meats and cheeses....The cooked breakfast didn't look that appetising and consisted of potato cakes/hash browns, beef bacon, sausages, beans and scrambled or fryed egg. The sausages looked like the economy ones out of Asda (Wall Mart)!!! Overall I was fairly happy with it and all the cutlery was clean. Coffee tasted quite nice too.. The Novotel is a 5 minute walk through the exibition centre and I'm told you can use their facilities at cost. Taxis are very frequent and it costs an average of 21Dhs=\u00a33 to get to most of the large shopping centres. There are several free bus services but the're not always that frequent so I took taxis for convenience, particulalry when returning to the hotel. Note that a Taxi to Wild Wadi Water Park (next to Jumeira Beach Hotel) is around 35Dhs= \u00a35. Overall I would recommend this Hotel to anyone who wants the guarrantee of a quiet hotel, close to all the major shopping centres but at a modest price. The only downside besides the ones already mentioned is that there are no local shops where you can pick up water, snacks, or drinks after midnight. You have to make do with the bar food and drinks which obviously are going to cost more.", "Date": "May 18, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "kiwi, in europe", "Title": "\u201ccouldnt even get a reservation\u201d", "Author": "tuamfamily", "ReviewID": "UR7483702", "Content": "I have done the research and loved the reviews of this hotel.

Novotel and Ibis are close to the Trade Center and are next door to each other. Dubai is an expensive city so this is the cheapest yet decent hotel you can get for the price. Just to give you an idea we paid almost 500 Dhs which is about $140 USD which included breakfast. This was a corporate rate, otherwise it would have been about 600. It\u2019s quite a lot for a hotel such as Ibis but not much for a hotel in Dubai. Here are some points to help you decide if you would like to stay here. If you are on a budget this might be your best bet, I wouldn\u2019t recommend any other cheap hotels based on what I\u2019ve heard: \u2022 Rooms are clean but VERY small \u2022 Not the best pillows or mattress \u2022 No mini-bar, coffee maker and NO hairdryer in the rooms \u2022NO PARKING, which was insane and we had to pay an additional 60 Dhs/night for parking \u2022Not the friendliest and most efficient staff but again you are UAE and can\u2019t ask for more. \u2022VERY SMALL SHOWER, no BATH TUB \u2022Only one restaurant which has a buffet so if you just want a light meal, you have to go out.

Helpful staff let us put our luggage in secure storage while we looked around the city. We returned at 10am and our room was ready (theoretically checkin is 12noon). Room was good although no view to speak of. Staff were helpful throughout our visit, and do note there are free shuttle buses to the 3 biggest malls (approx every 2 hours) as well as hourly shuttle buses to *and from* the airport. Ibis is about 10 minutes' taxi from the old city and the creek. Equally it's about 10 minutes' taxi from the new city, sites like the Burj Al Arab hotel and the \"Mall of the Emirates\" which contains Ski Dubai. All these timings are weekend timings, apparently things slow down a lot during weekday rush hours. You can also walk to the \"avenue\" of incredibly high rise buildings, takes about 10 minutes although they are rather soulless when you get there. Joggers can happily jog around the world trade centre block (Ibis, conference centre, Novotel) - we did, it takes about 15 minutes. However, there's not much else in the area unless you take a taxi; one passes the front door every couple of minutes. At \u00a350 our room was good value. However, as budget travellers / backpackers, we may be tempted to stay in Bur Dubai (neer the creek) next time for closer proximity to the incredibly cheap Indian food in that area, and the souks.

I was happy to accept this and expected to have to go out feeling rather the worse for wear. At approximately 8.30am I was informed I could take my room and I was able to have a good rest before hitting the sights. I was not charged extra and I was extremely grateful that they did this, although no doubt they were keen to remove the tired-looking bedraggled traveler reclining sleepily in their foyer! I found the staff exceptionally friendly, helpful and polite, except for one snooty one who thankfully I had very little to do with. I was however quite perplexed by the fact that they did not advertise anywhere that they offer a free coach service to a number of Dubai malls and the beach area. The cabs in Dubai are inexpensive, but still, it is more convenient to take a coach from your hotel rather than try and flag down a cab in the heat. The Ibis is not far \u2013 but still a decent cab ride \u2013 from the main attractions. The breakfast was excellent and I popped into the lovely Cubo bar for drinks and snacks one afternoon. The rooms are basic but very clean. I\u2019ve definitely had smaller. As this hotel is at the lower cost end (but still expensive for Australians staying there) I think it offers excellent accommodation and a high quality of service. I stayed there for two nights, transiting to Morocco, but maybe if you are looking for something more comfortable (there is no \u2018view\u2019 to speak of and the basicness of the room might get to you after a while) you could go elsewhere but it would cost you an arm and a leg.
