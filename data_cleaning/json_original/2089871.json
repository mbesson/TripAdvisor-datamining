I come here at least 5 times a year for business and I normally stay in the W or Nikko. Thought lets try something else; this ended up being a very bad decision. Hotel is in Polanco but away from main attractions. Hotel is new however the customer service is extremely poor. I was down graded when I arrived however hotel refused to offer a refund. Told me had to go to Orbitz where this was booked; called Orbitz but they told me the hotel is not willing to give a refund. On the arrival day the hotel had no wifi; front desk told me that the person in charge of that was not available.... Another very important thing to know for future bookers; do not book the more expensive 2 floor suites. Those rooms are located directly facing the extremely busy street Periferico; you will not sleep. There are many better options available in Polanco; do yourself a favor and do not stay here. Hotel is clean and new but customer service is very very poor.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat modern rooms.

Location wise, it is a little out of the way to the main retail and restaurant area of Polanco. I made a mental note to ensure convenient location in future with a little more homework. I am not demanding or expect much service and I appreciate there is a language barrier; while some staff speaks far more English than my pitiful Spanish, a smile would have crossed all the barriers. The front desk staff did not make me feel welcome and gave me the impression there is lack of care in their attitude. The first night I had a room facing the main roads and considering the way the Mexicans drive with one hand on the horn it was very noisy. I had a room change to a different tower for the other 3 nights. It was an improvement but I could still hear muted traffic noise. I love travelling and travel 3 months a year all over the world. Sadly this has been one of the most unpleasant experiences. I make an effort not to complain in life. This review is to save other non Spanish-speaking travellers from unfriendly experience. There are better options.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Las Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d2089871-Reviews-Las_Suites-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "Price": "$140 - $232*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Campos Eliseos 470, Polanco</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Mexico City</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">11560</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2089871", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c7/23/c723cf76c4e6b30cb703d7accd38cd192large.jpg"}}
