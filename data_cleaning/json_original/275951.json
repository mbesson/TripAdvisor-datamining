Hotel is well situated to shops, cafes bars etc and the water bus stop is a few minutes away. We had room 23 in the annex part of the hotel, room was ok, looked straight into another building so no daylight whatsoever got in. Otherwise it was clean although did smell a little stale. Bed was really comfortable and room cleaned every day. Bathroom was tiny, and the shower was the smallest little cubicle to wash in, also the hairdryer was so old it really had little effect!(wish i had taken one) These however are small complaints and i feel the hotel offered good value for money in venice, which is why we chose it. Breakfast was pleasant with lovely cheerful and friendly staff. The hotel itself and the area around also felt safe and comfortable to be in, which can be a worry when visiting a new place.

Months in advance, I reserved a room which was secured via credit card. Shortly before my trip, the hotel contacted me to inform me that my credit card was denied. I used the same card for numerous other hotels and restaurants in Europe on this trip, and none of them ever had a problem with it. The most likely possibilities are that (1) someone at Alle Guglie didn't know how to operate their credit card equipment correctly, or (2) this was a tactic to try to cancel my reservation so they could re-book the room at a higher rate closer to the date of travel. I unwisely offered to pay by a different mechanism, and the hotel said that I could pay by wire transfer. (They refused to accept personal checks.) I paid the total they specified, plus the wire transfer fees charged by my bank. When the money arrived, the Hotel Alle Guglie's bank also charged fees, which they took out of the payment. The hotel told me that I would have to send another payment to cover their bank's fees (which would have required me to send another wire transfer and pay my own bank's sender fees again). I complained that I had paid the total they specified, and they should have informed me of their bank's recipient fees before I sent my payment if they wanted me to cover those fees. In response, the hotel immediately canceled my reservation. I complained to them a long time trying to get my payment refunded. They refused to refund the money by any method other than wire transfer. Eventually, they sent a partial refund, because they deducted the value of their bank's fees recipient fees as well as the fees for sending the money back. In the end, between all the bank fees, I ended up losing about 40% or 50% of the money I spent, plus I had to get a different hotel room at the last minute (which cost more than the one I reserved months in advance). I don't know if this was simply a terrible mistake or a dishonest attempt to get rid of my reservation so the room could be re-booked at a higher rate. Either way, I would never reserve a room with this hotel again.

The people are unbiased Customers whereas the management obviously has something to lose (your business for making an educated decision based on real information... which is why we all use Tripadvisor). I say this because I see many management responses below which are discounting or denying what people have said that we have also seen first-hand ourselves and know to be true. Please make sure you look at our photos and the photos of others as pictures say it all. However, also note that Alle Guglie has posted many photos themselves and they show the place as being new and shiny and clean. Definitely not the case as you will see from true guest photos. Many of these are easy to identify because they come from their website. We could write many things about the disaster of Hotel Alle Guglie, but unfortunately only have limited review space. Here goes. First, the breakfast is NOT an amazing breakfast by any standards. My wife and I are very experienced travellers with 50 years of combined travelling experience to all parts of the world including less developed countries. So we have a good grounding on the wide range of standards and temper our comments according to the location and we review relative to the price and relative competition. The breakfast is the worst we have ever had in any European country in any level of hotel. Very limited food and cheap. We didn't even bother on the third day. Second, the air conditioning is NOT adjustable from the room. We were dying of heat in our room and went to politely inquire with the \"helpful\" staff about how to use the air conditioning. We were told it can only be adjusted from the front desk. I'm a professional engineer and I looked at the air conditioner in detail myself, and it definitely had NO adjustments and was also to my surprise improperly installed. They cut a rough hole in the wall and then just pushed the AC unit up to the hole. No hose, no seal. So a good majority of the hot air just recirculates back into the room. As for clean and in good condition? Any claim of that is a joke (refer to photos of mould and dust and hair everywhere). The hotel is a run down dump in a major state of disrepair. The carpets are so filthy they are black... they need regular steam cleaning. The majority of the room furniture is worn and often cracked with doors on failed hinges, etc. (see photos!). The rooms are pathetically tiny... and yes we know this is Venice and yes we expected the rooms to be small. This is normal in any old European city such as Paris and London. But Guglie has divided up their hotel into prison cells (another Customer told us he calls the place a Gulag prison and referred to his room # as a cell #). We could not move. We had no place for our suitcases. We had no room to walk around the bed. The bathroom dimensions were no more than 4 feet by 7 feet (see photos!). The worst problem is the mold. We actually stayed in two different rooms... first a regular room which had terrible air conditioning, was tiny, was loud (right outside breakfast room, and had paper thin walls). We complained to the \"friendly\" hotel staff and asked to simply check out the next day since we were so appalled and unhappy (we have never asked to leave a hotel for quality reasons ever before out of the thousands we have stayed at in life). They refused us... a very bad Customer service attitude by any standards. Instead, they insisted on moving us (remember the prison analogy?) to a \"better\" room. Yes this room was bigger, but it was also very run down. This was their \"superior\" room... superior with dirt and mold. The mold was so bad that the stench of it was overwhelming and we had to leave the door to the hallway open whenever we came back. I made the mistake of putting some of my clothes from my suitcase inside the dresser (with the cracked doors) and to my horror all my clothes picked up the mold stench and had to be cleaned at our next hotel. We sprayed the room with deodorant and tried everything. We would have loved to leave but were trapped in a bad experience. The source of the mold? We can only guess it was in the walls and the ceiling, but it came from the bathroom. And yes the hotel definitely knew about it (wait for the management response denying it however) because the maid also sprayed a deodorant in the room every day to try to cover it up without success. As for misrepresented, well we can debate this one with hotel management but you decide. Go to their website and look at the photos showing the hotel on the water. Look at their photos showing clean and new rooms. Then look at the real photos here. This is what any good Tripadvisor user does. This is what helps us all make good decisions and avoid scams so that we can enjoy our vacation and not throw away our hard-earned money. You will see in our photos the filth, the state of disrepair throughout the hotel, and the pictures of the place as it really is in June, 2011. The upstairs hallway looks nothing like their photos. Their is an old, broken CD player that hasn't worked for years. The chairs are sticky and dirty (steam clean if you really care management!), the floor boards are cracked and lifting. The list goes on and on... The free wifi is useless. Terrible coverage and you have to go searching for a spot somewhere in a hallway that actually has sufficient signal strength. You could turn this into a game for some entertainment to avoid staying in your room. Good things? The location is excellent, but then again if you take the time to research you will find many other hotels in the same location or close by and they are at similar price points or slightly more expensive. Many are truly on the water as well. Remember that Venice is actually fairly small and well connected by a good water transit system, so many locations are great. Any other good things to say? No. We have never been so determined to write a review ever before and we wrote this because we feel we were really misled and we were very upset. We really don't want other people to unnecessarily go through the same thing. To date, Tripadvisor has always served us well on hundreds of purchases and every other hotel we stayed at in Italy was what it claimed. We look for things like the ratings and the management responses because those typically mean that the hotel cares and is actively doing something. But I guess we learned from this experience that this isn't always the case and that it can simply be that the management has figured this out to their advantage.

When we entered the room, we saw the door had been partially kicked in and there was mold in the shower. The bed covers were simply a sheet and a paper - thin cover on top. The beds were rock hard as were the pillows. That night we got no sleep. You can hear conversations going on one or two rooms over. On top of that we had told reception to turn our air - conditioning off, as you cannot control the temperature from your room, and even after the second ask they didn't turn it off. So now with a freezing, loud, and uncomfortable room we tried our best to get the little sleep we did. Breakfast? Barely! The breakfast consisted of an airline meal.

Some of the staff are helpful and professional. Pictures make the rooms look pretty, and some are, with nice headboards and wall paper. But even for Venice, the rooms are very very small, and the bathrooms (I saw several rooms as they had to move me) although very clean and new-ish, are almost uselessly tiny. In the bedroom there was no place nor even space for a medium-size bag, and I found it easier to crawl across the bed to get to other side as there was not really enough room to get around the bed, especially with the suitcase on the floor. This was true in both rooms I had. Perhaps a triple room, or a specially requested superior room would be different. I did feel the rooms were very clean, however. The other problem is that I could hear light coughing and other noises and conversations as though they were in my room, and in the morning I found that the noises were not next door, but several doors away, which was remarkable. The breakfast: a very difficult job for the two hard-working breakfast room staff. There are not enough seats/tables for most people to eat at same time in the small room, and of course this can be the case at many small hotels. But here the situation is not managed, nor anticipated (you don't know until you arrive to a crowded room with others waiting). It is a shame as they will make you a nice coffee of whatever type you order, and the breakfast has a lovely bread basket, cheeses, pastries and cereal. However, you feel you should hurry hurry and eat so that the waiting people in the cramped landing can have their breakfast also. It is a bit tense and awkward and claustrophobic, and the waitress is trying her best. If you manage to get a great rate, and you would like to be near the station (I think about ten minutes walk/3 bridges) and you are traveling alone and with a very compact bag, and can sleep through the conversations and noises from the other rooms, you may be just fine. Maybe a specially requested superior or triple room would be much better for space at least. I did however find other rather better hotels for the same rate nearby, and with water views even (both my rooms at the Guglie faced another window). One more thing which may be important to know: many of the rooms are up narrow stairs (I believe there is no lift) and there can be a lot of steep and narrow stair-climbing.

No duvet covers on the bed: just a sheet and a duvet on top of it. We couldn't sleep all night, because it was terribly noisy in the street: during first part of the night people were dismantling their tents, during the second part they were setting them back. On top of that in the morning we discovered an ant nest under our closet with dozens of ants on the floor. They run away very quickly once you start walking - this is why you can't see them in the evening. And about the breakfast: it's not a buffet at all, in fact, you have something similar to an airline meal with lots of small packs of various stuff and a waitress offering you tea, coffee and juice. So, the bottom line is that this hotel should be avoided at any cost, and what we realized, having travelled to Venice, is that you have to either take a room in a reasonable hotel at a rate of 300+ euros or take a room in the mainland in Mestre, where you can get a reasonable 4-star hotel at about 100 euros and come to Venice by bus or a train (it's just 10 minutes).

When I emailed the hotel, asking if the VENEZIA METRO is near the hotel, they mixed it up with the Santa Lucia Metro and told me that it is 5 minutes away when in fact, you have to take the metro or a bus to reach it. Based on their misinformation, I booked a 3am train ride to Florence an had some trouble getting to my train!

Altough the hotel was on a main thoroughfare (lots of shops, trestaurants, fresh fruit stalls) the double glazing shielded you from any noise. The staff were incredibly friendly and the continental breakfsst was more than sufficient. We took the hotel up on their free tour to Murano and a private taxi duly arrived the next morning to pick us up (you have to make your own way back by vaporetto). The taxi ride was a great substitute for those who are a bit unsure of gondolers. We had the quadruple family room at the very top of the hotel - the stairs were a nightmare for a not very fit fatty like me making me very organised for fear of forgetting anything in the room but could be prohibitive for some. The room was exceptionally clean with a small dressing area separating the two bedroom areas. The second bedroom area with twin beds had a seriously sloping roof - the second bed could only be reached by climbing over the first. We all bumped our heads over the course of the 5 days and my 12 year old took half the skin off his spine standing up to quickly - I certainly wouldn't recommend this room for teens upwards sharing with adults. I'd also be a bit wary recommending this room to those with very young children as the door opened straightout onto the staircase and the dressing area also had about 4 steps leading up to it. The bathroom was tiny - a bit challenging getting in and out of the shower (skinny folk shouldn't have a problem) and opening right on to the double bed in the main bedroom area making things a little odour-challenenged in the morning. Despite all the issues mentioned above I would return to this hotel as it has alot going for it - we never spent very much time in our room because there was so much to do and see and as such, it made a great little base.

At the airport, there were buses outside waiting to take people to venice bus park, the closest road to the centre, this cost about \u00c2\u00a35 return, it took about 30 mins but they do say allow 1 hr 10 minutes ! Its got to be the easiest and cheapest way ! The Hotel was about 5-10 minutes walk from the bus park, so straight away you get to see some of Venice but pack light unless youve got someone else to carry your stuff ! You can get water taxis to your hotel but apparently cost about the same as the flight ! The hotel is right in the middle of a quite busy street of bars, cafe's, market stalls, shops and restaurants, near the canal and main canal ! 2 minute walk fron the Jewish Ghetto and about 100 yards from the closest water bus stop, which has four different buses every 15 minutes, which take you anywhere you could possibly need to go. The hotel was really good, our room was quite small and my brothers was massive but unless your planning on staying in, it isnt a problem, the bathroom was spottless and cleaned each day ! I was worried about noise because the room was close to the reception but had no problems whatso ever. Although there where rooms which actually walked out, into the breakfast room but this was only small. The staff where brilliant, they organised restaurants each night for us to go to, that were really close but of the busy street, and where cheaper but by far the best ! Four of us ate 3 courses each with 3 bottles of wine, 207 euro's including the tip ! The hotel was about 5 - 10 minutes STROLL from St Marks Square with loads to do and see on the way. Dont be fooled by the good looking restaurants around there, they are a rip off, try the smaller ones on the alleys and side streets, and the small pizza bars and cake shops, especially the Tiramasu and Perfiteroles !
