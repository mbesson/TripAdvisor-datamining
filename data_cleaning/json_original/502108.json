The wide variety of food available at breakfast was wonderful, hot and cold meats, smoked salmon, cheeses, fruit, cereals, eggs cooked in any style you wished, jams, honey, every type of bread, fresh fruit juices, hot drinks and much more. Our room was adequately spacious, clean, comfortable and quiet (we requested a quiet room when making our booking). We booked a five night stay including breakfast, paid in full at the time of booking to obtain a good price (but unable to cancel), and this was excellent value for money.

The ventilation in the washroom worked like magic, it was complete silence and yet there was never steam after the showers. The front desk staff is very helpful, especially Anika, giving advice to different sight seeing places, booked our taxi to the airport, etc. We ate at the hotel restaurant one cold rainy evening in August. There were only three tables when we were there, the service was immaculate, the food was delicious,the price was very reasonable. They offer a 3 course children meal and drink for children 12 or under, for E12. The M&M ice cream dessert at the end was a real surprise. We paid E5 earlier near the Parliament building for the same thing but had much less ice cream, less M&M, and not decorated as nearly attractive. There was candlelight on the dinner table, no rush, no noise, we didn't have to bring our wallet even, that was the easiest, most relaxed, enjoyable meal in our entire trip. The only little minus is that, the one playstation at the play area is always taken up, my 9 year old son didn't have a chance to play even once during our 4 nights stay. However, we didn't go to Berlin to play Playstation, so it's not a big deal. The flea market on Sat and Sun was a unique experience, if you have time, try spending a couple hours there. Taxi between the hotel and the international airport ranges from E15to E20. If there is anything to make this even a better hotel, maybe add some laundry facilities within the hotel.

Needless to say we thrilled we didn't have to walk around for ages until we found the hotel - first impressions were really good as a key location is important to me. Check-in was easy and simple - despite a name change on my part - we had no problem which I was anticipating. All staff are fantastic English speakers and could not do enough to help us. One receptionist 'Julienne' was incredibly helpful to me and my sister helping us book tickets and giving us all information that we required for sightseeing - she was better than the tourist information at the airport! The rooms were lovely - we had infact booked a room for 4 people but only 2 of us could make it in the end but the room would have been a tight squeeze for 4 adults but for 2 it was perfect. The only English channels are sky news and bbc news (but MTV) and as we did have to spend 1 night in the hotel that was annoying - but the room was clean, quiet and we were happy to read instead. I don't normally come abroad to stay in but we had to so it would have been good to have a bit more choice. There is a bar downstairs and spa facilities on the 6th floor aswell though. The breakfast was out of this world there was everything and anything on offer! Freshly made omelettes, fruit, sausages, eggs, bacon, cheese, salmon, cereal, toast, pastries, juices, coffee, tea, flavoured teas, hot chocolates, yoghurts - amazing. The breakfast totally set us up for the day aswell. We also ate in the restaurant for dinner and although a little pricey - the food was amazing. Cornelius the bar man was really helpful in recommending portion sizes etc. On Saturdays and Sundays there is a massive flea market that goes on outside the hotel (not noisy) and definitely worth a look! We also really liked the fact that you can pick up the circle line tour (bus tour) outside the hotel too. We got the train to the TV Tower which was so close on the train and Charlottenburg Palace is closely to the hotel too. From the train location aswell you can very easily get to Potsdam for a day which I recommend!

The hotel is located in the Tiergarten - a huge park in the middle of Berlin. This limits the number of restaurants in the immediate area.

Firstly, the toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom and has no sink - not especially hygenic especially if somebody else is using the bathroom at that time. Secondly, just one small pillow is supplied per person with no spares - ask at reception for more if needed. Thirdly, as there is construction work taking place 50 metres from mthe hotel, we left the window shut.

Just add that we used the free internet in the lobby and had no problem using it whenever we wanted. Can't comment on the hotel restaurant (apart from the excellent breakfast) as we ate out every evening. We found four restaurants within 400 yards of the hotel - including Hooters just opposite which proved less tacky than we expected. Best by far was (I think called) Tiergarten Quelle which is on Bachstrasse just beyond the second entrance to the S-Bahn station. Reasonable prices, great local food and beer and packed with locals.

There is an Ironing Room on the 3rd floor. Lifts only work if a valid room key is inserted. The Negatives Internet very expensive at Eur 19 per 24 hrs. Room service menu is very limited. The room service phone number is not listed on the menu. The phone in the room did not have a shortcut key to room service. All this led me to believe that the hotel doesn't like doing room service! To place a room service order, I started trying the shortcut buttons. I first tried front desk, they tried to put me through, but eventually the line went dead. I tried another number and got through to the restaurant. As I wanted something different to what was on the menu, the restaurant host offered a club sandwich with fries. This was delivered in just under 20 minutes. As soon as the waitress left, I realised that the fries were not delivered. I called the restaurant again and was told that fries were all gone but they can do wedges instead. These were eventually delivered 15 minutes later. Food quality was good. Another minor detail which got me confused was that the room phone was marked with the wrong room number. This caused a bit of confusion when I was placing the room service order. Just across the road from the hotel, there is Hooters Restaurant, very affordable and nice busy atmosphere. Train station is also across the road from hotel. During rush hour, Taxi from Tegel to hotel cost me Eur 25 while the trip back at 7am took no more than 15 minutes, costing Eur 15.

Now, for the good news. The hotel is extremely modern and clean. The rooms are large and pleasant; very comfortable. They are running a summer promotion in 2009 of 69 Euros a night, which is a steal for the quality of the hotel and its location. The staff is extremely warm and friendly; very helpful. There are bikes onsite which you can rent, which is great fun in Berlin and was very convenient. The only odd thing about the hotel itself is they told us that our floor did not have WiFi, and on the floors that did have WiFi, it was very expensive: 25 Euros for 24 hours. However, we were oddly able to pick up a T-Mobile hotspot at the hotel, which worked fine, and was 29 Euros for 30 days! I am not sure if the hotel knows that this hotspot is undercutting its internet option, but if they don't, that's kind of suprising!

The rates were actually better than the conference discount, and I think the hotel was generally better, too. (I booked through the hotel website. Bring your confirmation page to prove your discount.) This is a very modern hotel with good sized rooms (a couch as well as a bed), an easy to use safe in room, as well as a small fridge (it's full, with beer, juice, soda, water, etc., but you can take theirs out and put yours in if you like). The windows open, and if you ask for the quiet side of the hotel, you get a nice park-like view as well as a nice breeze. The young staff was cordial and capable. All speak English as well as German. The breakfast \"buffet\" was really a banquet and the quality of the food is excellent. There are more than 50 items to choose from. Germans like breakfast and you can have several, since many go back for seconds (and skip lunch). It's worth doing once to see if you like it. There are cheap breakfasts nearby, too. I did room service twice and it was prompt and had very good food and wine both times. The hotel is next to the beautiful Tiergarten park (with a cafe in it) and is also right next to an S-Bahn (elevated rail) stop that has several lines running to it. If you like, you can even travel directly to Potsdam from this S-Bahn stop. Very convenient to the whole city and makes it very safe to come home even if its late and you are alone. (Great restaurants at Savigny-Platz are only two stops away.)There is also a city taxi stand outside the hotel and the airport is only about 25 minutes away.

Restaurant and bar looked nice but did not sample the food since there are many other restaurants in the city (Vivolo has great Tapas!)

The trains are really easy to figure out for any first timer and the automated ticket dispensers can display in different languages including English. The lobby was modern, I believe the hotel opened last year so everything still looked fairly new. May seem cold/trendy/corporate for some but I prefer it. The room was on the 4th floor, a decent size (comparable to most non-suites in US chain hotels) and yes, a minibar!

There is a separate bathtub from the shower stall as well as a separate toilet. A nice touch was the speaker in the bathroom with separate volume control so that you can listen to music (TV doubles as a radio and alarm clock) AC was strong and fan was quiet although I had to crank up the settings manually. Sound insulation was awesome and did not hear a thing all night from the hall or from the next rooms. Bed was comfy with a large duvet. Taxi was around \u20ac14 to Tegel Airport (TXL) and took about 15 minutes with no traffic since it was a Saturday morning.

Overall I was very impressed by the facilities, the room was large and very clean, with an ensuite plus, unusually, a seperate WC, which could be really handy if there were more than one person sharing the room. The room also featured a mini bar and safe (my only gripe is that there was no wine in the mini bar, only beer, but I ate in the hotel restaurant, and the staff were happy for me to bring the remains of a bottle up to my room, so this was really not a big problem). On checkout I was advised that the first item out of the minibar is gratis - gotta love a freebie! I made use of the gym section of the \"fitness centre\" on level 6, which was bright and airy but doesn't have a huge range of gym equipment, however, for the three days I was there it did the trick. If you enjoy a run, you could use the Tiergarten on your doorstep. My only gripes would be that there was no iron in the room, however, there is a laundry room on level 3 which the staff will give you a key card for on request. Also, the pillows on the bed were really better described as cushions in pillow cases, and there were only two English channels on the TV, BBC News 24 and CNN. However, I didn't go to Berlin to watch TV and I did find a good radio station to listen to when I got tired of hearing the same story on BBC News 24 for the sixty third time. I made full use of the hotel restaurant, as after each day of sightseeing, I was too tired to go out again, and it was just easier as a lone traveller to eat in house. The food was great and the waitress very friendly and attentive, although it was by no means very busy during my stay. The hotel bar was a nice quiet spot to sit and enjoy a pre dinner drink and has a happy \"hour\" each night. The rate I got from the hotel website, 108 Euros per night, included an excellent buffet breakfast, and I thought the price was really great value, considering what you'd pay for a similar place in London or Paris. The hotel is located about 100 metres from Tiergarten S-Bahn station, which was fantastic for getting around the city.

So whole experience of arrival was remarkably stress free. Hotel itself is large and the foyer is spacious so gives an impressive first impression. Rooms large, clean and comfortable. So we were off to a good start. Our first night we found we had to walk a bit to find a place to eat, so we learned to just jump on the train and go to other parts of the city to find things. Trains so good that this is no problem at all to do - and in fact encourages you to explore the city more than you might if a lot on your doorstep. Breakfast varied and tasty.

Hotel is situated on Strasse des 17 Juni right by Tiergarten S-Bahn station. Having stayed in a few Berlin Hotels, this is no problem to get around anywhere regardless of the other reviews you may have read on here about this being out of the way. The Hauptbahnof is 5 minutes away, Alexanderplatz is 10 mins away. Bahnhof Zoo is 2 mins away by S-Bahn. If this is out of the way, i dread to think what areas like Pankow, Wilmersdorf and Charlottenberg are for some people!! Hotel lobby and corridor areas are modern, although in typical Novotel standard they are modern without being too flashy. The rooms are of a nice standard about 27 Square metres, with TV, honesty minibar, Tea and coffee making facilities, shower and seperate bath. Seperate toilet too in the room. Plenty of storage space, In room safe and a quiet interior room, I really couldn't fault this at all. For a hotel amongst the same star rating as the Park Plaza WallStrasse, its not as nice , but its equally on a par with the Park Inn in Alexanderplatz or the Novotel Berlin Mitte or Suitehotel at Potsdammer Platz. Rack rate at this hotel is about 145EUR per night which is reasonable considering what you are getting. Try getting a similar standard in a UK hotel for the same price turning up on the day!

There was a great choice for breakfast of hot and cold buffet, plus fruits,cereals, breads etc. Worth the money. From Schoenefeld airport, the S9 train goes directly from platform 13 to the Tiergarten station, just over the road from the hotel. A City tour ticket is worth buying - 19 Euros for three days unlimited travel and reductions on entry prices to some attractions. Trains from the Tiergarten station are every five minutes or so, giving you easy access to the whole city.
