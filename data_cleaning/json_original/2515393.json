Its weird paying under $100 and then the next month paying $200 for the same room/service etc.....leaves a bad taste in our mouths. We stay here when we go to baseball games in Seattle and generally walk to the games and back.....about 40 mins each way. We've found the staff good-often we jjust email our bookings and always get a quick response. We keep to ourselves when there so there has never been a problem and like to stay on the ground floor at the end of the hall.....just find less congrating people outside our door there.

Inside the lobby is coffee, lemon water, and pastries 24/7. The worker at the front desk was very helpful with directions and bus tips. For instance, this was a non-rental car trip, so we needed the FREE buses to get around downtown. The \u201cfree zone\u201d buses run through most of the day (6 AM \u2013 7 PM, I think) in the downtown area, so take advantage. You will need to walk a few (short) blocks to get the free zone from the hotel, but it\u2019s nothing. As for breakfast, it is very good for a complimentary breakfast: waffle bar, eggs, sausage, cereal, yogurt, juice, milk, fruit, and pastries--really good for the money.

Was pleasantly surprised at the clean accomodations (first time at a Travelodge)! Room was small, but it had an easy chair and ottoman! I loved the down comforter, but it was almost too hot! I had the AC on to bring the room down to 66 degrees. But I DEFINITELY have to get me some DOWN PILLOWS!! Those were the BEST! If I am just going somewhere overnight, I usually pick Motel 6, but then I have to bring EVERYTHING!! This Travelodge had all my basic necessities: hair dryer, IN-ROOM COFFEE (although generic - no Seattle \"brands\"), iron/ironing board. Wi-Fi a bonus, but didn't use it. Said up-graded spa, but the jets were broken. Would have been nice, too, after 2 days of trekking around Pike Place, up and down hills.... The room door also kind of stuck one morning. If I go for a week somewhere, I usually go a little more spendy, just for more room to spread out. You can take a cab from the motel/Space Needle (2 blocks away) to Pike Place for about $6; if you park in a paid parking area for more than 3 hours, it will cost you $26!! Oh, one thing I didn't care for is that Travelodge CHARGES for parking! $12/day! I travel a few times a year, and I have never stayed somewhere where the motel charges for parking. Breakfast was decent - not much hot food. Just sausage, waffles and hard boiled eggs; basic fruit choices (apples, oranges or bananas); but lots of selections for cereal, yogurt, pastries, bagels, etc. They even put the leftover pastries out in the lobby when breakfast is over. And the lobby coffee is Seattle's Best. The staff was very nice and helpful. They give you walking maps to get around, and they gave me speedy directions to get back on the freeway to get home!

We had two rooms - each room had one bed and was quite compact but that is to be expected in a city hotel. The shower is a single stall so if you have trouble maneuvering in a small space like that you might want to keep that in mind. At check-in we did have some difficulty with one of the rooms. Initially they gave my parents a room that they later chased us to the elevator and said someone was already in that room. I have never actually opened the door to a hotel room to find people occupying it but I imagine that would be a big, unpleasant surprise for everyone involved. Fortunately they got this issue resolved pretty quickly. There was always free coffee and tea in the lobby, and a very nice free breakfast with lots of variety in the morning. If you are picky about the view from your room you may be disappointed - the back of the hotel is right up against the back of the hotel next door. However, the front of the hotel faces the Seattle Center so we could see the Space Needle from the window outside our door. The hotel is a very short walk to the Seattle Center and there is a monorail there that goes downtown to a mall for $2. We are big walkers so we had no problem walking a mile or so back and forth to the center of town every day, but if you are not into that much exercise you might want to plan to take a city bus or a monorail. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel, but keep in mind that it is a bit of a distance from many of the attractions.

I can still recall The Space Needle under construction during one of our visits. Flash foward to the present and this babyboomer checked in at the main desk of one of Seattle's venerable motor lodges. I was greeted by two smiling clerks. Informing them that my last stay was in 1979, I was given a Seattle street map to get me up to speed. Thanks again, guys. My compliments to the persons in charge of interior decor. Throughout the hotel, from the elevator entrances to the hallways, are framed prints of works from Salvador Dali and Jackson Pollock among other artists. My room was spotless and there were plenty of fluffy towels in the bathroom, including a hairdryer. The bed was comfortable and not too soft, either. I would start my day with a complimentary USA Today and walk a few steps past the lobby to the buffet room with a free hot breakfast waiting. Their waffles are perfect and they know how to make a great cup of coffee, too. The only glitch throughout the whole stay was momentary when the toilet lever in my room suddenly wouldn't flush. I called the front desk and the courteous young man replied, \"Ooooo, that's not good. Someone will be up in a few minutes to fix it.\" Within 5 minutes, there was the hotel plumber at my door with a smile on his face and the problem was solved. Housekeeping deserves applause, too, for their polite and cheery way they greet guests. Centrally located, this Travelodge is just a 10-15 min. walk to the heart of downtown.

Stayed the night on a Friday before an early Saturday morning flight. Checkin was very good, staff at that point were simply great. Based on the reviews posted on here, I expected a great nights sleep with the raves about the new beds and how comfy they were. I am convinced someone who works at this hotel wrote those reviews!! The bed we had (queen) was new maybe, but hard as a rock. It hurt my ribs to lay on my side more than one minute...something I have never experienced...even when laying on a hard floor. Having been to numerous countries, I have experienced some pretty uncomfortable beds. This bed was by far...the worst. I believe what made it so bad, was the pillows they had. They felt like feather pillows...very soft to touch and squeeze. But place your head on it, and they went flat..very flat, stayed flat...felt like sleeping on a sandbag. I never did get to sleep. I gave up at 2:30 am...my body now racked with pain...as if I had been hit by a truck. Have never experienced any kind of bed that actually made my body ache and hurt from laying on it for that short a period of time. Went to the lobby to get a cup of their 24 hour coffee. It was indeed very good coffee...that part was great. Stepped outside the lobby doors to have a smoke, and heard the doors lock behind me. Wasn't sure why that was, but had my key, so no big deal. Watched in amazement as this kid (23?) comes running across the street and right up to the lobby door entrance where I am standing. In pursuit is a white mustang car with 2 thugs in it threatening to kill this guy. I honestly got spooked and decided to step back in and get out the way in case something happened. Guess what...couldn't get back in! No place to put your key and open the doors. Had to wait for the guy on duty to respond to open the door (slow as all heck!) and only after I had convinced him I actually had a room there??? Got brave again after the mustang and thugs took off, and the guy left the front of the hotel. Stepped back out to have another cup of that really good coffee with another smoke...had to calm my nerves! I'm halfway done with my coffee, when up walk 4 young guys...totally hammered. They just hung outside and smoked and joked about the night they just had. Turns out they were military...stationed in Hawaii...on leave I suppose? They were actually very nice guys...although very drunk. They decided to go into their room...again after a couple minutes of trying to convince the guy on duty behind the desk that the hotel keys they were showing were real...and for that hotel. They got about 7 or 8 steps toward the elevator when one of them turns and runs for the door to go outside again. Guess what's coming next?? Yep...barely got the door open, and he just starts puking all over the enrtyway of the lobby just outside the doors. Honestly hurled like for 3 or 4 minutes...a real mess to say the least. Sad to say...at this point I was amused. I began to wonder just what the heck kind of place was this I had booked a room...for 2 nights!! I managed to mostly step around the puke and get back in to the hotel...the night guy knows me by now and just unlocks the door without the formal proof of room rental there. I leave at 4am... FINALLY! I check out and head for the door with my luggage in tow... only to be greeted with this huge pile of puke that there is still no way to get around without having the ability to jump 8-10 feet with luggage in flight. I couldn't believe the lazy desk guy had not at least hosed the mess out of the way...it was a huge mess and he did NOTHING! I asked him how I was to get out without getting the puke on my shoes or luggage, and he simply rolled his eyes and went back into his little room off the back of the front desk. I couldn't believe it! Yes...I got puke on my shoes, simply no way around it without jumping over it....impossible with luggage. Did I mention I had booked a room there for the night after my flight returned....and had already paid for it? Yep I did. Got back into Seattle at 12:30am...dead tired. Even though it had been reserved, and paid for...I drove right on by without even thinking of spending the night there. You could not have paid me to stay there that night...or ever again. And no, I am not making one bit of this up...all true! And you guys that work there at this place...I know you read these reviews because we discussed the rave reviews about your beds at check-in...you really need to find some better night help if nothing else.

There is a bit of a gap between the room door and the floor which lets through a bit of light in the evening (if you like to sleep in total darkness like I do), but a towel quickly sorted that out. Our towels were nice and fluffy and that there was no bath did not bother us at all. The hotel lift is a bit stuffy. The breakfast is quite a sugary affair but coffee, orange juice, a wonderful Washington apple and a bagel can set you up for the start of the day. I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "May 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "san francisco", "Title": "\u201ccheap and unpleasant\u201d", "Author": "SanFranciscoSleeper", "ReviewID": "UR7479294", "Content": "This hotel is not very clean.

He was also very helpful with info about the city bus (which has a stop about 500 yards from the hotel). My friend & I found the hotel to be in a great location since it was within walking distance to the Space Needle & surrounding attractions, & it's near the interstate. Finding a parking spot was never a problem, & the area appeared to be safe (I was worried about my car but nothing happened). Our room was clean & contained all the standard amenities, & was quiet. The best feature was the wireless internet access in all the rooms...I logged right on & got up-to-the-minute info about things to do in the area.
