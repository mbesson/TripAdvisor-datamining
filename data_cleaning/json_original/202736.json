A very friendly and easy going personnel is ready to satisfy all your needs. Rooms are very clean decorated in the Venecian style (Murano glass chandelier and mirrors). Delicious breakfast is served with fruits, yogurt and good coffee. You can eat to your satisfaction. The hotel is on the Cannaregio canal close to the railway station, and this hotel is easy to find. To the San Marko piazza take a vaporeto from Ferrovia slow #1 or fast #2 (25 min with a great site-seeing). After walking packed streets in the tourist center, we appreciated the quiet hotel site situated near by local pubs, where we could taste a real Venetian cuisine and talk to the locals. The personal gives you a helpful suggestion where to go. The hotel is next to the historic Jewish ghetto. A gondola ride tour is close by, call Luka cell.3405116063. He is a great chap and give you a good price for a guide and singing on his round tour which leads through the maze of small canals to the main canal and back.(we got 45 min. Ride for 80 Euro ) For great services, romantic rooms and a practical location, we highly recommend this hotel. Suggestion: From San Marco airport take \"Alilaguna\" boat to \"Guglie\". The hotel is on the other side of the canal. Just cross the bridge and walk along the canal (5 min). This is a wonderful way to come to Venice. Some people dislike an odor in the hallway. Remember, this is a very old building located in the over thousand years old decaying city. But rooms are odorless, --as Venetian canals. Also, do not expect elevators in the old Venetian building.

We mostly walked though, if you are reasonably fit, Venice is not really that big to do on foot. Venice is a horribly expensive city, maybe for a reason. Hesperia in that context is very reasonably priced but is definitely not a budget option. We did receive nice service and everyone was very friendly at the hotel. Now for the negatives. First of all, internet costs. I do think that nowadays internet should be free, especially if the hotel is not cheap. The price was not even very reasonable, 5 EUR for 1 hour. This really irritated us as we needed the connection to book our next accommodations. The room was tiny and we had pretty big suitcases as we had been travelling for 2 months. Also, there was no A/C and it was seriously hot the time we stayed, almost +30 Celsius every day. Furthermore, there is no lift, but we didn't really have issues with carrying things. Breakfast was included, but it was terrible. I have never had such plastic-y rolls. I resorted in eating the packaged crackers rather than the bread. Also, coffee tasted like instant nestle, which is rather despicable as we were in Italy! All in all, would not return.

It's on the top of our we-must-go-back-there list. When searching for a place to stay for our two nights, the primary criterion was location, to be near the Jewish Ghetto where we would be eating and spending significant weekend time. With so little time in the city, we wanted a hotel that would be very near the train station, our mode of arrival/departure. The hotels our friends/family had recommended were all booked, so we searched on our own. We weren't disappointed. The best part of the hotel, in terms of our needs, was the location. It's an easy 8-10 min walk from the train station and, most important (since we had several pieces of luggage with us), it's a flat walk, with no bridges (read: steps) on the way. It's a family-run hotel (two sisters and staff) and there's always someone on duty at the front desk, 24/7 (the only one of our 3 stays in Italy that we could say that). There's a lobby and lovely breakfast room on the main floor, and the latter even has some tables outside right on the street, a quiet side street (though only one block from a major thoroughfare). The room is small but very adequate, with a modernized bathroom/shower ensuite. The only problem was that because the windows faced a courtyard and other rooms, we had to keep the shutters closed since the curtains were sheer and one could easily see into the other rooms. The TV (and remote) worked, and unlike Florence (where the TV didn't work at all) and Rome (where they had only Italian channels), we were able to catch CNN, which was a good link to the 'outside' world, however briefly we wanted that. The night stands and ceiling had beautiful Venetian glass chandeliers (see photo) which made the room even lovelier and more connected to its unique location. The staff was very helpful regarding sites and getting around and even sold water taxi passes to avoid our having to wait on line at the cashiers near the canals. One thing we'd learned from our first stop in Florence (see that posting) was the importance (and frequent lack) of elevators when arriving with heavy luggage. So I double-checked a few days before arrival, saw they had no elevator (I hadn't particularly looked for that when I made our original reservation) and happily paid a surcharge for a room on the first floor (we would've had to bring our stuff up two flights if we hadn't upgraded - that was a close one!). The closest water taxi stop is a 5-8 min walk away which is a bit less convenient but didn't really matter since we were not traveling on them with luggage and didn't mind the short walk. As noted in my other postings (Rome and Florence), here, too, there was a charge for WIFI access, and it was particularly expensive - charging by the half-hour and not even by the day, so the one shortcoming for techies. One lovely feature we took advantage of one late afternoon was the rooftop terrace. Yes, this did mean walking up 3 flights from the street (but only 2 from our room), we were treated to a small rooftop terrace with table and chairs, a bit of a view (treetops of the nearby public park) and sunlight, birds and flowers.

The continental style buffet breakfast was an excellent way to start the day. The rooms were very clean and tidy with daily towel changes. If you want a canal view you need to be in 105, 106 or 107 or 205, 206 or 207.

That said, it was a great room that almost felt like its own separate apartment, we really liked it. There can be some street and canal noise but nothing you couldn't shut out by closing windows. The hotel location is great, just far enough away from the main drag as not to be too busy and noisy but close enough to walk to everything you would want to visit. Do walk to everything because you see so much en-route and you'll save some money on Vaperetto fares. Don't be afraid to wander off the beaten track as there is very often a pleasant surprise, a nice square or delightful cafe or bar or cheaper restaurant just around every corner. Our favourite island was Burano with brightly coloured houses lining the canals, then Murano for the glass and least favourite Torcello with nothing much to see or do there.

Strangely, it was never noisy. The room not only had the king-size bed but also a desk and a daybed, yet was large enough to move around comfortably. There were also two bedside tables with reading lamps - perfect for us. There was a nice closet, with a small refrigerator and a safe. The bathroom had a large shower and was kept spic and span. Breakfast - which was included with the room - was served buffet-style in a pleasant dining area on the ground floor. Lots of good choices, including fruit and cereals, yogourt and croissants, and great coffee served at your table. For 82 Euros per night, there is no question this was a great bargain for such a gem of a hotel.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wolverhampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAweful room\u201d", "Author": "SR786", "ReviewID": "UR90705039", "Content": "The room was aweful for its price.

Not the tiny ones near San Marco) - clean, has a washbasin inside the room. The big bathroom is outside your room, but private (only you have the key, and its just 3 metres away). Heating is good (important in Winter!). TV is hopeless-the only English channels are BBC and MTV - this unfortunately seems to be the case in most of Venice.

Like in most of Italy, there were hardly any items (bread, croissants, cereals, juice, cheese, coldcuts, and the mandatory 5 types of coffee and tea).

I arrived June 2nd with a nice check in - the gentleman carried my luggage up 2 flights of stairs, showed me my room and left me with an A/C remote. I don't know what a hostel looks like, but I'd imagine it's the Hotel Hesperia. Bare bones minimum - very old furniture, a stone floor with not a single rug, a 1950's tv ( about 8 inch) hanging from the ceiling with about 7 channels (none English speaking) and a \"double\" bed that was simply two small twins pushed together. The bed was so hard, I could literally feels the springs jutting into my body and struggled to sleep the 3 nights I was there. The shower and shower curtain are tiny, so if someone is remotely obese, the floor will flood. Anyway, on my first day there I soon discovered that my ATM card wasn't working and had about 5 euro. I went back to the hotel to find a different man at the desk who claimed to be French and spoke no English and little Italian. He flat out refused to let me use the phone and contined eating his dinner at a table behind me while I cried and used the computer (for a fee) to try to work it out. By the way, I'm a 30-something female who was travelling alone. In the morning, the woman at the desk let me use the phone (with a 10 euro charge on the bill) so that worked out. When I came back that night, my A/C was off and the remote was gone. The same guy from the night before came up, turned it on and refused to give me a remote. Couldn't change the temp..it was either on or off. He continued to say \"no change room tonight\" and was tapping his watch impatiently...but that wasn't what I was asking - I just simply wanted another remote. I'm giving this hotel 2 stars solely based on location (about 10 min walk from train station with several water bus stations nearby) and breakfast, otherwise it would be zero. Terrible room and unaccomodating staff. I should have taken a picture of my room, but it wasn't the pretty ones your seeing on this website. The kicker was, it was 460 euro for 3 nights.

Staff member Caterina (wonderful kind young woman) showed us to the apartment located several blocks away (which was actually closer to the Rialto Bridge and other attractions) and upon seeing it, we accepted.

At our request we transferred to the delightful room on the roof-top terrace (great for sitting and enjoying an al fresco cigarette as all rooms are non-smoking) . Again very clean, with refurbished, stylish shower room, and quite spacious enough.

The Hesperia is only a few minutes walk from the station, and there are no canals to cross. The room was small, but clean and adequate for our short stay.

The bathroom also small, but we didnt want a dance in the room or the bathroom, just clean and tidy, which is exactly what we got. The breakfast was a basic but fresh continental breakfast (bread, jams, fruit and cheeses) , which set us up for the day each day. We ate outside each morning.

Just after crossing a chinese restaurant, there is a street and the hotel is the right in front of u on the right. The whole walk takes max 10 minutes if u have luggage. There is also a small general store next to the hotel run by an old lady. Good to get water etc at reasonable prices but it closes soon after 6 p.m. Chinese restuarant mentioned earlier is good, do try it. Room was spacious, very comfortable with nice bathroom of good size. It seemed that the bathroom had been redone recently so it was great. Our room had a split air conditioner which worked just fine.
