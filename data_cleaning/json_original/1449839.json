The rooms were compact but very efficient and just fine for 2 people. The bathroom was small but well appointed. Good wifi and very helpful at the front desk, The best part is the free breakfast ~ what a spread! We went through the buffet twice so we could sample everything and it was all delicious. We tried to book in again when we returned to Istanbul the following week but sadly they were full as it was Easter week.

Overall you have the feeling to be at least in a 4 stars when you are in the room. You have some nice touches like complementary slippers. - Good breakfast, for such a small hotel, there is a bit of everything and of good quality. And the waiters are really taking care of the room and guests. - 50 meter from the tram stop, that takes you to the airport (with one change) or through most of the tourist destinations - 300 meters from the metro line that goes directly to the airport - Just off one of the main streets of old Istanbul. Within a 20 minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk you have the vast majority of tourist attraction and places to eat - Some of the staff is very attentive and nice Contra: - Our room was of normal size, but some I have seen passing by are really tiny, so I suppose it is a matter of luck. The only serious complaint I have is to the management: 1)You put a kettle with 2 tea bags and 2 instant coffees in the room and do not restock them? When we asked to get 2 tea bags at our 3rd day of stay, we were told that we could not as the policy was not to refill? Great move!! You saved something in the region of 0.05 lira and got two annoyed customers. 2) Even although most of your personnel are very good, some of them treats you like you are a nuisance. In particular I am referring to the man at reception the morning and early afternoon of the 8th of November (I was not able to see his badge). All the times we encountered this person during our stay, we have been not only ignored repeatedly, but he did act really annoyed of us just passing by, as if we were disturbing his internet browsing session. Now this is my review number 48, and I think it is the first time I bother to complaint about rude staff, but if this is his attitude, he should not work in the hospitality industry. 3) Sort out your reception area: even if you are short of space, it looks like a 1 star motel; with wooden boards holding up printers and generally messy. Not at all reflecting how nice the rest of the hotel is. If I had not already booked, I would have walked away.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cVery comfortable and excellent service\u201d", "Author": "pajibhut", "ReviewID": "UR120745469", "Content": "If you want to stay close to the Grand Bazar this hotel is definitely an outstanding one.

The room, as other reviews point out, are quite small but clean, and there's no nice view from the room. Its nice for couples but if you have a lot of luggage, it feels cramped. The lift/elevator is tiny and moves at a very slow pace.....I felt claustrophobic in it, so I often took the spiraling stairs. The breakfast was really good with variety of fruits yogurt and breads. The waiters were attentive and courteous and helpful.

I wondered how the hotel could fit into such a narrow building, but it does. A visitor has an access to all features required from the 3* hotel - including a very decent breakfast. Rooms are very small, but comfy, I liked the bed and a clean bathroom - but mind you, if one is sensitive to the issue of available space, an episode of claustrophobia is likely. Within a walking distance from the hotel one can find a T1 tram station (to Sultanahmet), a metro terminal (to the airport) and a couple of bus stops convenient if you want to cross the Golden Horn. Lots of other hotels in the vicinity, but I think that Polatdemir is a right choice for a budget-conscious tourist.

WiFi did not work well, which is a minus. Location is strategic: you are 10 min walk from the Blue Mosque. The tram stop is just round the corner.

Transport to and from the airport was easy, since it is the last station on the metro line going to the airport,a 30 mins ride to ataturk airport. A small walk to the nearest tramway as well.

The rooms are clean, new and nicely furnished. We checked out on our 5th day in Istanbul to go to Cappadocia and returned on the 8th night to the same hotel around midnight again. The second time we checked in, we got upgraded to the Advar suite. The suite was perhaps 1/3 bigger than the ordinary rooms but the furnishings were the same, except for the king size bed, the much bigger LCD tv and the bath robes in the bathroom.
