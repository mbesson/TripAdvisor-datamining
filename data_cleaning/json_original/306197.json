The internet has connected form our room or what I understand was by my room number. That very strange because we didn't use any internet during our stay. My sister used her iphone to access to internet which she opens the internet package from Thailand that used via SingTel, So, we don't have to use Hotel's internet. When we asked about the time the internet had been connected. It was 7.30 pm on 17April and 8.30pm on 18 April and we were not back to the hotel until 9 pm on both days. We had been asked the question like Have we let someone in to our room? Do you sure you didn't connect the internet? Our answer No. When we start to ask our questions how and when the internet had been connected and how it go to our room account.

This isn't saying much, because all Singapore hotels have gotten shockingly expensive over the last few years. But you're more likely to find a good corporate or other discount rate at the Hilton than at its competitors. If you're not eligible for a corporate rate, check to see if you can get the Hilton Honors \"miles and money award\" for about $80 plus 20,000 Honors points. -- The Hilton is right in the center of town, a block from the Orchard MRT and a short walk from the many shops, restaurants, and food stalls along Orchard road. -- On both of my recent stays I've been upgraded to the executive floor. This is virtually automatic for high-tier Hilton Honors members and is available to other guests at a reasonable price in dollars and/or Honors points.

Our room was very nice, although you can tell that the hotel is aging and could do with a refurbishment. As travelers from Europe, our flights always leave at around midnight, so I usually check out around 9-10 pm. This has always cost me half a day's charge extra, with I find worthwhile. No mention upon check-in (I told them we'd check out late) I guessed it would be sama-sama\u2026 But alas, on the final day, we had two phone calls from the executive lounge and one visit from the same to ask us again when we'd leave.

The hotel rooms and bathrooms are showing their age but are comfortable nevertheless. The concierge at this hotel is one of the best i have ever encountered in my life. They were always smiling and willing to help, at any time of the day or night. My biggest complaint with the Hilton Singapore is the check-in service. I arrived at the hotel at 3pm (check-in time is 2pm). I was made to wait till 5pm in the lobby for my room. I had just completed 24 hours worth of flying and the last thing i expected was for my room not to be ready. Two days later some other family members of mine checked in to the same hotel and were also made to wait past 5pm for their rooms.

As a treat I organised 2 nights away in Singapore and via one of the travel links here in Trip Advisor, booked to stay at the Hilton Singapore in Orchard Road. Previously we had stayed up above Orchard Road in Mount Elizabeth but the 2 hotels were not worth the money to be honest. I'd stayed at the Hilton Paddington in London a few times and enjoyed my stay there. So, I thought, why not try the Hilton in Singapore. Excellently located for the Ion Centre, Wisma, and all the Orchard Road shops and restaurnats that we know, trust and enjoy. Check in was flawless - in fact we had a one point 3 staff checking us in. I had mentioned that I got e-mails from hilton from a previous registration and suddenly a Hilton HHonours form was produced and duly filled in. Check in took a few minutes. The process was very friendly and cutreous. We were on the 8th floor a vay down the corridor on the left. Staff were cleaning/changing other rooms and we were greeted by them in a very friendly manner. We opted to do shopping immediately. I liked the fact that the hotel had placed by the phone a notice to call if we required the beds to be turned down. Very good - no disturbance. After the first haul of shopping - I connected to the internet - $25 for 1 day - (no 2 day option - sadly) the set up was easy and fast (Al Manzil from a previous post please note). There was a messsge bleep on the phone which turned out to be a recorded welcome. I don't know why hotels do this as the welcome at check-in is sufficient. It's a small annoyance but an annoyance non-the -less. Two slight problems with the room. The door did not close fully indeed there was quite a space atthe top of the door and below. we had to push the door fully to enable the security device to close properly. Later walking down the corridor we noticed a few doors in the hotel with a gap at the top of the door. Not very good for sound control from noises outside the room. Secondly, there seemed to be no way to activate the plug in the bath to allow the water to drain out the bath/shower. I got really frustrated trying to drain the water away - eventually allowing the water to drain naturally through a gap in the plug. Now to the good thing. The room was spacious and very clean. The room was cool and the air con was on when we entered the room. The twin beds were large, with good bed coverings and pillows - the linen was crisp and clean. The room lighting was good - not one of these places with light switches all over the place where you had to spend 20 minutes or so trying to brighten the room by switching on all the ambience lighting. One switch for the bathroom and one switch helpfully marked Main Lighting! Congratualtions Hilton Singapore. There was one table lamp for work with the computer if I needed it. The TV was flat screen and a DVD player connected which pleased my partner very much. Over 50 world Wide Channels on the TV and I was pleased that all the channels were listed correctly and worked. The second and final night we decided to use room service - and had a superb meal brought to us by the room service staff.. My US beef stake was perfectly dome and you could slice through it like the proverbial hot knife through butter. Well done room service staff. The next morning - check out was just as speedy and polite as the check in. No pain or bother. I enjoyed my stay at the Singapore Hilton and will stay again when the opportunity arises.

I ask again, trying to push this time a little harder by mentioning that the \"executive\" room was not such (I went and saw the room and was small). She talked with the manager again and I got the lounge access (well worth it). The room was small IMO, with nice crabtreen and evelyn amenities; super king bed and view to Orchard Road. The lounge was well equipped with spirits, fruits, and food. The breakfast and afternoon tea were great, so was the evening dishes (sushi someone?). The hotel is walking distance to ION orchard, tangling shopping centre, Shaw Cinemas, Orchard MRT station, Forum mall (full of kids stores, including Toys R' Us).

I chose the hotel primarily for its location along Orchard Road and also for the attractive room rate it offered. For shopaholics, the entire avenue where the Hilton and many other hotels are located is absolutely retail heaven. Beware though because Singapore has become a very expensive city to go shopping particularly for branded items. This Hilton is definitely showing signs of age but it is visibly well-maintained. The lobby and other public areas are not as spacious as the other deluxe hotels in Singapore so it can feel a bit crowded. The coffee shop in the lobby where breakfast is served can fill up quite fast so guests may need to queue specially during peak breakfast time. Expect typical breakfast buffet fare, with a variety of hot & cold items on offer. I felt that the breakfast was uninspiring but found no real reason to gripe as it was substantial & filling nonetheless. The standard room given to me appears to be recently renovated. Although the bathroom looked a bit dated, I was completely satisfied with the in-room amenities and level of comfort offered by the room. Guests should be mindful though to triple lock the door anytime you are inside the room. I have barely settled into my room when to my horror a housekeeping staff entered my room WITHOUT knocking (the room had no door bell) to deliver a can of potato chips for the minibar. I had no clothes on when the housekeeping staff entered as I was about to take a shower. I was fuming mad at this intrusion and I shouted at the staff to leave my room at once...but she just stood there telling me that she merely wanted to deliver a can of chips....no apologies were offered! I did manage to shove her out of my room and after that I quickly donned the robe and stepped outside to speak to her. She was still there outside my room holding the can of chips. I told her that common decency dictates that people should knock first before entering any room that is not theirs. Housekeeping staff working in hotels must also announce their presence before entering a room by loudly saying \"Housekeeping!\" To make matters worse, the staff barely spoke English so I was not even sure if she understood me. So I decided to call the attention of the Manager on duty. He met up with me afterwards and was apologetic. He seemed to understand the embarrassment I felt and offered his apologies.

Our experience was mixed but will not go back again. Fpr a five star hotel, a few things were not up to standard. The location is great - right on Orchard Road and a short walk to all the shopping and MRT station. Our first impression was on check-in when we were told that they could not fulfill our booking for a non-smoking king size room. We protested and they quickly found a room for us - why wasn't this offered up front? As soon as we stepped into the room, we noticed that the carpet was very stained and this was off putting - couldn't it have been steam cleaned? The bathroom was tiny and had a curtain over a shower/bath. Our bath mat was removed after the first night and we ended up using hand towels for the floor. Water leaked from the shower down one side of the wall and partly flooded the bathroom floor - we couldn't figure out how. Had we misplaced the curtain whilst using the shower? The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. The bar downstairs is quite nice and a couple sing jazz there most nights which adds a nice touch. The buffet breakfast food I ate was very ordinary. There was no sign of any tropical fruit - where were the mangoes, papayas, star fruits and other delicious south east Asian fruits? The yogurt tasted a little passe. I then went to the hot food section and picked a nice lotus pau. I also had the potato omelette which was very dry, the baked tomatoes and a sausage which were ok. The water from the water dispenser was contaminated by fridge smells and tasted awful. On our last night, we had a terrible time there. We came back from dinner and decided to have a drink at the rooftop bar. We arrived and were greeted by the Manager (?) with a warm smile. We asked if we could have a drink and she pointed us to the outside pool area where the bar was. We arrived and while trying to find a suitable seat, the waiter approached us and told us that the bar and pool area were closed for a private function. Pardon? We were just welcomed at the door. Should we leave we asked? No, we could have a drink but we would need to be quick quick. So that really annoyed us but determined to savour our final night before an early morning departure, we persevered. I ordered a sherry and my husband ordered a whisky. My sherry didn't taste like a sherry, so I told my husband it didn't taste right and we quizzed the barman. He had poured me a cheap port, not a sherry. My palate is good and I sent him off to get what I had ordered. Anyway, we only stayed for a \"quick\" drink and went back to our room. Within about one hour, we were awakened by roadworks right underneath our window, even though we were on the 15th floor, it was unbearably loud. This went on until 3am... We just could not sleep and the night manager kindly accommodated our request to move us to a quieter room which wasn't that much better because it still faced the roadworks.

That hotel was the Hilton Singapore. Shame is, that upon check-in I learned they had given away my balcony room and put me in a standard business room. I was paying for a King Hilton Executive Plus, so I made sure that they adjusted the rate to the less-than room. If I hadn't mentioned it, it wouldn't have happened. So, after all the research, no fruit from the Hilton on Orchard Road. Instead, overpriced so-so hotel that came with big regrets. Room service was odd -- they answer as though room service was something they'd never thought of, an entirely new concept to the Hilton chain. Err, umm, sure, we can deliver? Yea, good thing, 'cause I'm what you might call starved. An hour later a sad burger arrived. I was sad too. It was to get better. After 20+ hours of flying I fall asleep before my body hits the bed. I'm off in a never-world of sleep, sleep so deep you could drift off forever into it. 3 hours into this sleep I'm blasted into hyper-reality with a screeching alarm and voices yelling something at me over an intercom. I jump out of my bed, I stumble around in circles not knowing where I am, who I am, if I'm dead, if this is real. I rush to the door, I can't figure out what's screeching so loudly, in my stupor I think that if I can squeeze the doorknob on the entry door it will all stop. As I'm squeezing, I start to gain some of my senses and I begin to hear what is being said over the intercom. The woman's voice is informing me that there has been a fire alarm activated and to stay calm and wait in my room while they assess the situation. Doesn't take me but a few seconds to assess my situation, I'm on one of the highest floors in the hotel, it may be on fire and I'm being told to stay put and stay tuned. Guess what Hilton Singapore? I lived through 911 and I know what to do when you're in a highrise and there may be a fire and someone is telling me to stay put. Guess what I do then Hilton? I get out as fast as my two legs will take me. On go the jeans, t-shirt and shoes and I'm rushing down the fire escape two steps at a time. 21st floor, 20th floor, 19th floor and so on. It seems as though I'll never get out, but I do. I go out to the street in front of the hotel and every light is on in every single room. Lemmings, this is exactly why people don't survive in hotel fires. False alarm or not, I'm finding out which it is from the safety of the street. You only live through 911 once. Hour later it's confirmed it was a small kitchen fire that was put out. Thanks Hilton. Can't fall back asleep. Hilton has assured that I'll be going on 3 hours sleep. That's enough, I could go on to describe the other let downs the hotel had in store for me, but I hate to be pegged as a complainer.

For this stay I had booked an up-grade (if available) to a suite and it was made available at check-in. However, it turned out to be a bad hand of cards. The room in general was refurbished, but the minibar section, wash basin / kitchenette combination (very odd) and whole bathroom were more Golden girls than modern hotel. Even worse, the room door did not live up to the expectations one would have for a Hilton suite as it did not close fully and felt very shaky. Even if it was Singapore, you'd expect to feel complete secure in your room. This issue was brought to the attention of the hotel (Executive lounge staff). First time nothing was done to make it right. Only after talking to the duty manager things were checked. After lenghty wait and trial to change the actual door it was evident that nothing could be done - this was a structural issue. Two other suites were available, but unfortunately they had the same problem, and for one of them the same issue was even more severe. So the hotel was not able to get it right. Some chocolates were sent to the room next day, but apart from being a nice gesture that did not change the fact that have more severe issues. We were booked in a different hotel for two following nights and had a one night stay booked here after that.

I stayed here for one night on 11February 2011, as this is our designated crew hotel for all layover crew stays while in Singapore. This hotel also hosts crews from several other airlines from across the world. By far, this hotels single best feature is its LOCATION. It is located right on Singapore\u2019s most famous street-- Orchard Road. If you\u2019re into shopping, this is THE place to be- bar none! The hotel is located on the northwest end of Orchard Road, and from here you can easily walk the length of the road stopping at any of the major mall complexes or access the public transportation systems (bus or subway-MRT). It\u2019s located almost directly across the street from the Royal Thai Embassy and within a few minutes walk from several key shopping locations such as Tang\u2019s Plaza. Shaw House, and Wisma Atria- to name just a few. The closest MRT station is Orchard station (NS22) and is less than a five-minute walk from the hotel front door. The hotel building itself is one of the older physical properties on Orchard and in the immediate area, but has undergone renovations to modernize. Most all of the guest rooms have been fully remodeled and as well as most of the dining and beverage venues. The hotel does show some architectural signs of its true \u201cage\u201d-- the rooms actual square size-- but overall it\u2019s been well maintained and modernized. ==> Lobby / Check-in: As is customary with airline crew, our rooms are pre-assigned and pre-paid, so there no real check-in formalities; they only need to distribute individual room keys. Guests who are members of the Hilton HHonors program have a dedicated use check-in desk. The hotel is shaped as an open centered rectangle with guest rooms along the perimeter of each floor. There are twin floor-to-ceiling glass elevators on each end of the hotel. The open lobby bar area has an impressive view of the hotel and the upper floors. ==> Room: My room was an \u201cExecutive\u201d level room on the 12th floor. It was done in cooling shades of white, off-white and light wood colors. The bed was a standard King size and was of a moderate firmness. Lots of pillows and there was a light duvet. The room also had a medium size glass-top work desk with multi-phone, multi-power ports and wired internet access. Wireless internet access is available (for an extra charge or included with higher room rates) the TV was a flat screen LCD TV with full local and international programming. Among the nice touches was the provisioned in-room coffee and tea set and stocked mini-bar (but at typically high mini-bar rates). The tinted glass windows are large with great city views and well sound. The drapes are not \u201cblack-out\u201d so those who are sensitive to light may find sleeping difficult after sunrise hours. ==> Bathroom: This is where the hotels original dated construction shows\u2014the bathroom footprint was a bit on a smaller side.. but.. it as well equipped with a tub/shower combination. The hot water ran immediately hot and the pressure was excellent. There was a nice selection of Hilton-label pre and post-bath toiletries. There was a magnification (make-up) mirror as well as a mini hair dryer. No bath robes provided. ==> Hotel facilities and Amenities: The hotel has three dining venues- a seafood/grill, casual brasserie and a deli. In addition there is a \u201cjuice bar\u201d and the lobby lounge. I did have breakfast at the grill and it was good, but priced at a premium. I will say that the hotel appears to have a decent range of dining options all in-house. Remember that Singapore is a foodies heaven and there are many, many excellent and value-priced dining and drinking options near the hotel and within an easy commute. So, you are by no means \u2018hostage\u2019 to the hotel options. This is NOT to say they\u2019re not good\u2014my breakfast was rather good, only that you have lots of options should you choose to avail of such. ==> Leisure amenities include a large roof top pool with sun chairs and tables with sun umbrellas- and have some good views of the surrounding Orchard street area. It is possible to order food and drink from here as well. The hotel has a smaller gym with basic exercise equipment and a modest selection of free weights. The business center can handle most all your needs: copy/print/fax, computer use, basic secretarial and translation services are available. You can send/receive your FedEx, UPS and DHL packages here as well. It\u2019s open 24/7, but after-hours you need to contact the Front Desk for assistance and access. Like most four and five star hotels they can accommodate your medical services, daycare/childcare and travel agent services needs. SUMMARY: PROS: This hotel\u2019s single biggest plus is its location, location and location. Quite simply, this place is hard to beat since it\u2019s right at the beginning of Orchard Street\u2014the highest profile shopping district in all of Singapore. Naturally owning to the location you also have very quick and convenient access to local public transport (bus, subway, taxi) from here as well. The staff was attentive, prompt and efficient and will to help you as requested or needed. The hotel does have very good and comprehensive in-house dining options, but again, due to the excellent location, you\u2019re well within easy commute distance to other options in the surrounds areas. If you can find a discounted room rate, it can be an exceptional overall value when you consider the hotel, location and facilities. CONS: The hotel is one of the older structural properties and as such, some of the rooms and bathrooms show their age by virtue of their smaller size\u2014as compared to newer built hotels. However, it\u2019s undergone a complete \u201cface-lift\u201d and most all of the guest areas are as good as other newer built properties. This hotel doesn\u2019t have as many of the newest \u201cbells & whistles\u201d as some of the newer and larger properties in the area. RATINGS: I give them a 5/5 for Cleanliness, Service, Location and Value. I never saw anything dirty or in disrepair; the service was typically Asian- prompt and professional; the location is it's single best selling point; if you get a room here at a discount, it's a great value. I gave them a 3/5 for rooms *only* due to the fact that the rooms are a bit on the smaller side than what today's average room looks like-- but this is more a factor of the hotels original construction date and not a deliberate shortcoming of the hotel itself. Lastly, I assigned them a 4/5 for sleep quality only because the lack of black-out drapes makes sleeping after sunrise a challenge. If this matters to you, then I'd give it a 5/5.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grafton, Australia", "Title": "\u201cSingapore stopover perfection for two nights at Hilton\u201d", "Author": "pvk4", "ReviewID": "UR95989008", "Content": "This hotel is so well run I couldnt fault it.

This is certainly a solid Hilton hotel with regard to the overall hardware and software, but I'll be at the same time comparing to this stay to my experiences at Conrad Singapore as well. I stayed a standard deluxe room (with executive lounge access) for the first night and paid an upgrade to the King suite (executive suite) for the second night. The standard room is just--standard. Nothing special to write home about, with all the standard flat screen TV, good wireless itnernet, and a very comfy bed. Staff was generally helpful as I arrrived past midnight and checkin process was smooth. Conrad, on the other hand, had bigger rooms, more TV channels for selection, a bathroom which is superior to that of Hilton (better amentities and decoration). The bed at Conrad is even better (albeit the beds being very \"high\") The King suite that I stayed in the second night was a pleasant surprise-- a lot better than I had anticipated. A very spacious living room and a slightly better bedroom. There is a separate shower and a bathtub which is a welcoming change. Should you stay at the Hilton the suite is a good choice for bigger groups (I was travelling solo). Conrad suites, on the other hand, are nice but the use of space was not very clever as there were a lot of \"empty\" spaces that could be utilised better--but besides this Conrad suites win hands down. I have read about the executive loung at the Hilton being very full nearing 6pm--and this is certainly true. I was at the lounge at around half 5 in the evening and it was rather empty, but as 6 approaches suddenly dozens of people appear in the lounge and seats and sofas get occupied very quickly--definitely need to go up earlier should you wish to secure seats with a table as well. Lounge staffs were very nice and helpful. Food selection was, however, slightly limited. The Conrad lounge is certainly a lot better once again, as the food selection is a lot better than the lounge at Hilton, and the alcoholic drink selection is better at the Cornad as well. So what does this mean? I guess the bottom line is that if you wish to spend more time using the hotel facilities and the room itself, definitely go for Conrad. The location of the Hilton is really the only reason why I chose it this time round--but Singapore is a small place so Conrad isn't too far off though. This Hilton is a solid hotel, but just that the Conrad , at least to me, is miles better and sometimes you can get a cheaper rate at the Conrad than Hilton. All in all a solid Hilton hotel but would suggest Conrad for a better overall experience in Singapore.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winterthur, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cmuch improved service\u201d", "Author": "swiss_global_trip", "ReviewID": "UR94757380", "Content": "A couple of years ago, I stopped staying at Singapore Hilton because of bad service attitude - a rare thing in Asia and therefore plenty of other option.

As a Gold or Diamond member you should receive; Free Room Upgrade, Free Late Check Out, Free internet, Free Access to the Executive Lounge. Room Upgrade: Upon arrival we were told that we had been \u201cupgraded\u201d. After exploring the room and property a bit we found that \u201cupgraded\u201d meant they had put us one floor higher. Not the executive floor mind you just one floor higher than they had planned on putting us. Was the room bigger? NO Better TV? NO. Balcony perhaps? NOPE After doing some checking to verify they were NOT full I talked with the assistant manager who reluctantly moved us to an upgraded room on the 22nd floor (executive floor) Save yourself some time and just insist upon that floor when you check in. Executive Lounge: The lounge is there on the 22nd floor but the problem is that you will need a reservation to use it. The lounge is VERY small and mostly two couches and some chairs. Guests who have stayed here before know to go before 6pm and reserve a seat or two or three or four or five etc. This means no matter what time you go between 6pm and 8:30pm there will be no place to sit, stand or even get a drink. They won\u2019t let you in the lounge unless you have a place to sit. They tell you to go back to your room and wait until they call you. Two of the nights we were there we saw one guest occupying a couch and two chairs for hours. Another night we walked in to find everything reserved even though the guests were not around. The manager says he knows it is a problem but won\u2019t offer a solution. If you plan on using the lounge go at 5:30-5:45 and stake out you spot. Late Check out: I called for late check out our last day but was told that it was not available. I receieved two calls after that wanting to know what time I was leaving. They want you out early! The funny thing is the next day when we did checked out we noticed that our bill didn\u2019t clear and our room was cleaned until after the late check out time we requested. We waited after check out time in the executive lounge for our car to the airport. Turns out once the hotel check out time is over your card no longer works and you cannot get to the executive lounge without an escort.

The glass desk was contemporary cool. The arm chair was old looking but comfy still. The best was the king size bed. This size is different from the regular US king size bed. It is much wider. Best of all, you can just walk across from the hotel and there is a bus stop that goes alongside Orchard road and the MRT station is right in front near the Marriott hotel.

However, the Hilton Singapore, even with a small lounge does have a very strong team to make your stay most enjoyable. It gets especially crowded during evening cocktails when guests wish to get their moneys worth in drinks. Also, I think they need to be more strict with regards to children misbehaving in the lounge during meal service. The hotel is 40 years old, therefore I am not complaining about its size. However, what I am displeased with is that you do not receive complimentary in-room internet access even with an executive room. Shangri-La Hotels offers this in ALL rooms, why shouldn't the Hilton?

No surprises, nothing to rage about. All is just as one would expect. Build in the 70\u2019s the age shows especially in the public areas despite the recent tries to hide most of the bad design of the era. Note that the work to renew the rooms is still ongoing \u2013 in mid-February 2010, I booked the stay using HHonors points for two nights. At the reception they however booked me in for one night only. To sort this out required four visits back to reception. Obviously once they booked you in it was next to impossible to have the reservation corrected in their systems. Location Located on the Orchard Road just a few hundred metres from the Orchard and Scott crossing Hilton is ideally located especially for shopping \u2013 the most favourite past time of this shoppaholic nation. Arrive in Singapore during weekend and the shopping centres on Orchard Road as packed as they can ever be. To access the MRT you\u2019ll first need to walk to Orchard and Scotts crossing and then go underground. And underground in Singapore means of course going through a shopping centre. Finding your way in this underground maze is as confusing as it can get. And at busy times the underground passage is extremely crowded. If you are in Singapore for shopping this location gets my full five points. However in relation to other activities in Singapore this location is worth 3,5 points. Public areas The hotel has seen lately a facelift \u2013 trying to get rid of the 70\u2019s. It\u2019s however in the public areas that the age shows. The lobby has no wow factor which some many other major hotels in Singapore have. It\u2019s adequate for its purpose and at the same time very ordinary. Enter one of elevators and you are brought back in time to when this hotel was build. Even though they\u2019ve tried to hide the age \u2013 the plastic surgeon has not done a very good job. It\u2019s as if the facelift was done in hurry and with bad workmanship. E.g. in the corridors the doors have been covered with cherry wood imitation laminate but leaving the \u201chand rails\u201d in the corridors to their original \u201cglory\u201d. An average sized pool is located on the roof top. The elevator will take you to 23rd floor from where it\u2019s one more floor to climb up to the pool level. The pool is dated \u2013 build as if the pool is something a hotel must have. Big plus however for the opening hours: the pool is open until ten o\u2019clock in the evening. In relation to other similar properties I give only 2 points for the public areas. It would be 3 if the plastic surgeon hadn\u2019t failed so miserably. Room Rooms at Hilton are a somewhat different story than the public areas even though there are shortcomings here as well. Recently refurbished, nearly all the dark wood panelling removed (the wardrobe doors are still the old ones) and replaced with light wood furniture and fittings the rooms are ... well... what you\u2019d expect in a major hotel. No surprises yet again. Bathroom still has the original marble tiles and dark wood fitting but even there they\u2019ve at least tried to bring the bathroom upto date by renewing the lighting fixtures and shower. New flat screen LDC TV \u2013 but the information system is as old as it can get. They\u2019ve done here the same as elsewhere \u2013 just cosmetic improvements. There was something wrong the air-conditioning system. You could adjust the temperature but it actually had no effect on anything. During daytime temperature and humidity in the room rose despite the aircon. By morning the temperature was ok but as the sun rose the room became quickly too warm again. Additionally the sound proofing could be better. You can hear the traffic from the street. And in someone walks in the room up above you can both hear and feel it: at least in my room I could hear the foot steps and sense the trembling coming from upstairs. Which makes one wonder whether the building is earthquake proof. During my stay some maintenance work was still being carried out. The banging and drilling in my floor (17th) started by 9 o\u2019clock in the morning and went on until 6 o\u2019clock in the afternoon. For the room three points. Executive Lounge Located on the 22nd floor modernised Executive Lounge is possibly the best feature in this hotel. Serving breakfast and evening drinks with small bites for HHonors Gold members and those having paid for an Executive Room the Lounge has as well free wireless internet access. Service is swift, drinks and bite sized food plentiful. Better than in many other Hilton properties. Full five for the Executive Lounge. Service Yet again, trying hard but not quite getting there. I booked two nights stay with HHonors points. At the reception they managed to mix it up and only book me for one night. Had to go to the reception four times to sort the matter out. And even when it finally was corrected the original booking for one night only seemed to haunt in their systems and resulted in not cleaning the room during the first day, having no newspaper the second and so one. Small things but still they are the ones that make the difference. Otherwise the service is impeccable. Door men opening the doors, someone to order you the elevator etc etc. As a summary Average and ordinary in nearly all aspects, Hilton is a safe bet. It doesn\u2019t match the top properties in Singapore but it is good still. The location is especially good is you are in for shopping. However the hotels on the other side of the Scotts Road (e.g. Marriott, Hyatt) are in a slightly better position as you do not have to cross Scotts Road.", "Date": "February 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cA nice Hilton\u201d", "Author": "Swissdiver", "ReviewID": "UR55381223", "Content": "Believe it or not: I was not there for shopping but only for business.

This hotel also hosts crews from several European and Middle East airlines. This hotels single best feature- above all- is its LOCATION; located on Singapore\u2019s famed Orchard Road. It's literally right on one of the most famous streets in the country. You can easily walk the length of Orchard road or access either of the public transportation systems (bus or subway-MRT) from here. It\u2019s opposite of the Royal Thai Embassy and within a few minutes walk from several key shopping locations such as Tang\u2019s Plaza and Wisma Atria- to name just a few. The closest MRT station is Orchard station (NS22) and is less than a five-minute walk from the hotel. The hotel itself is a one of the older hotel properties in the greater Orchard area and has undergone some renovations. Most of the guest rooms have been recently refurbished and as well as most of the dining and beverage venues. But the hotel does show its age and structural limitations of an \u201colder\u201d property. Lobby / Check-in: As is normal, our rooms are pre-assigned and pre-paid, so there is little in the way of check-in formalities\u2014only to distribute individual room keys. There is a separate check-in area for Hilton HHonors members. The hotel is shaped as a open centered rectangle with guest rooms along the perimeter of each floor. There are glass elevators on each end of the hotel. The lobby has an impressive view of the hotel and the upper floors. Room: I was assigned an \u201cExecutive\u201d level room on the 16th floor. My room was done in mostly white, off-white and natural light wood colors giving it a noticeably cool and clean feel. The bed was a standard King size and was of a moderate firmness\u2014a departure from the typical firmer beds that are prevalent in Asian hotels. Lots of pillows- both down and foam were provided and there was a light duvet. The room was also furnished with a nice medium size glass work desk with multi-phone and multi-power ports. Wireless internet access is available (for an extra charge or included wither higher room rates) Newer flat screen LCD TV with all typical local and international cable programming. There was a provisioned in-room coffee and tea set and stocked mini-bar (at typically high hotel rates). The windows are large with great views and well sound insulated and tinted to reduce the strong Singapore sun. Drapes are not \u201cblack-out\u201d so those who are sensitive to light may find sleeping difficult after sunrise hours. Bathroom: My bathroom was a bit on a overall smaller side but still well equipped with a stand-up shower. The hot water ran hot and the pressure was excellent. There was a nice selection of house-label pre and post-bath toiletries. The mirror is not anti-fog, so you may have to wipe, but there is a magnification (make-up) mirror as well as a mini hair dryer. No bath robes provided. Hotel facilities and Amenities: The hotel has three traditional eateries- a seafood/grill, casual brasserie and a deli. In addition there is a \u201cjuice bar\u201d and lounge. While the food looked good- and I\u2019m sure it is; in a town like Singapore with all the excellent culinary options available and right at your doorstep, I have to recommend you eat outside. For leisure there is a large roof top pool complete with sun chairs and tables with sun umbrellas- given the roof-top location, it affords some good views of the Orchard area. You can order food and drink from here as well. The hotel has a smaller gym with basic exercise equipment and a modest selection of free weights. The business center can accommodate most all needs: copy/print/fax, computer use, basic secretarial and translation services are available. You can send/receive your FedEx, UPS and DHL packages here as well. It\u2019s open 24/7 but after-hours you need to contact the Front Desk. Like most four and five star hotels they can accommodate your medical services, daycare/childcare and travel agent services needs on an as-needed basis. SUMMARY: This is a very good hotel for those wanting a hotel within easy walking distance to Orchard Road and it\u2019s a very good hotel on its own merits. However, in the past few years a number of new hotels have opened in the greater area that exceed the Hilton in terms of spaciousness, amenities, design and service level and as such have raised the bar considerably. If you can book this hotel at a discount you\u2019ll be getting a good overall value\u2014again, with a location that truly is \u201csecond to none\u201d, but without a large \u201cwow\u201d factor. PROS: Location, location and location. Quite simply, this place is hard to beat since it\u2019s right at the beginning of Orchard Street\u2014the highest profile shopping in all of Singapore. It\u2019s also quite easy to catch local public transport (bus, subway, taxi) from here as well. The staff is typically quick and efficient and will to help\u2014exuding Asian hospitality. Excellent food/drink venues are well within walking distance. CONS: The hotel could use a complete \u201cface-lift\u201d as some of the hotel facilities and guest areas are starting to show their age and the structure needs some contemporary style updates to bring it up to par with other newer hotels in the immediate area.", "Date": "January 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cAging.

The snacks, canapes and drink offered were very good. For breakfast we ate in the main hotel restaurant instead of the executive lounge, the buffet selection was excellent, food from every corner of the world. The staff at breakfast were very efficient and the atmosphere was relaxed. The room service menu was extensive and the quality of food excellent. The location of the hotel is very good, right on Orchard Road and near to all the major shops. The new ION Shopping centre close by, has a good selection of shops and a great food court in the basement.

Chose the hotel on Expedia due to its competitive rate and central location. Travelling light so arrived from the airport by MRT which took 45 minutes. The trip involved two changes of train but as these simply entailed crossing from one platform to another that was no hassle. The nearest MRT station to the hotel is Orchard which is 4 to 5 minutes walk. The hotel reception was very busy on check in but I was soon dealt with. I made my own way to the room and found that it had already been occupied. The receptionist had realised his mistake and caught up with me. Back in reception the front desk manager was very apologetic and after about 20 minutes another room was found for me and I was upgraded to an executive floor. The room appeared much the same as the first room however I had access to the executive lounge. I made my way to the lounge only to find that it was at full capacity (7.30pm on a Friday night) so I returned to my room and the lounge attendant called me 10 minutes later to let me know a table was available. Complimentary drinks (a limited range of spirits, house wines and beers) and a cold buffet provided a good start to the evening. Next morning I had breakfast in the executive lounge at the suggestion of the lounge attendant as the hotel restaurant on the ground floor was very busy. Breakfast comprises a fresh fruits, juices, cold meats, cheeses, various types of eggs, various breads/toast etc which was ample choice and the atmosphere was relaxed. The second morning I had breakfast in the main restaurant on the ground floor which offered greater choice but was extremely busy and noisy. I would recommend the executive lounge if the hotel is busy. I tried out the hotel gym which is well equipped and has helpful staff. I didn't manage to use the rooftop pool but it looked very pleasant. The best feature of the hotel is certainly its location for anyone wanting to be close to the shops and sights.

I arrive at the Hilton knowing that check in isn\u2019t until 2pm and expect the worse i.e. there won\u2019t be a room available. A polite and friendly gentleman at checkin greets me \u2013 he acknowledges my request for a quiet room on a high floor.

It had everything I expect from a good hotel \u2013 up to date audiovisual; broadband internet; comfortable but firm bed; fabulous shower with a temperature setting feature that I would love to have at home and nice toiletries. Food was expensive but good quality. Head to China Town for \u2018cheap eats\u2019. The gym was excellent \u2013 x4 treadmills; x4 bikes; weights etc all in working order. The pool was on the roof; clean with nice lounges and a bar. The Orchard Road side was a little noisy but not overly so. I did end up moving to a room on the other side but I\u2019m a light sleeper and it probably wouldn\u2019t bother most people. The Hilton to their credit affected this move efficiently within 5 minutes of my request. Shopping tips \u2013 Hilton is part of a mall with high end designer shops; next door is the Forum which is great for kids toys and clothes; down the road is Wisma Atria \u2013 my favourite for some interesting mid level boutiques. Next to Wisma is Ngee Ann City that had a department store (can\u2019t remember the name) with some good clothes and accessories plus 2 basement levels of cheaper shops with the designer outlets on the upper levels.

It's very good value for money. The hassle-free check-in was done at the exec lounge on 22nd floor. Room given was on the same floor - which made it so easy to access the lounge anytime. The refurbished room has a futuristic look to it, like the reading lights on each side of the bed, the huge plasma tv with dvd player, the nice recessed lightings and the glass-top workdesk. The tv programs are better than most hotels I stayed in - these include 2 thai channels (ch5 and 7), german, australian, japanese, french, etc etc apart from the staples like cnn, bbc and Ch news asia. Breakfast is by far one of the best I've had! I chose to eat at the ground floor cafe, rather than restricting myself to the continental breakfast at the exec lounge. The spread at the groundfloor cafe was excellent, and so was the quality - like SCS butter, Hero jams, wide range of breads and bagel, carved honey baked ham, good-tasting asian tim-sums like char siew pow, chee cheong fun, to japanese food. Service was superlative, everywhere I go, from the staff (even the electricians and plumbers) in the elevators who greeted me and had genuine smiles all around, to the doormen and the exec lounge staff who were so helpful. The disappointments I have can be categorised into 4 areas: (1) the smallish bathroom with a a tiny bathtub cum shower. I would prefer shower and bath to be separated. Having said that, the hotel uses top-line fittings like Grohe faucets and quality products like Crabtree & Evelyn's La Source. (2) the other area which fell short of my expectation was the rather dated swimming pool on the 24th floor, which has to be accessed by climbing the staircase from the gym at the 23rd floor. I was transformed to the 1970s era! (3) no complimentary use of broadband internet. I was told the hotel charges 40 cents per minute if I access internet from my room, or S$28 for whole day usage. I kept my Sony Viao at home! (4) the closet in my room (room 2225) was the only feature I suspect which had been left when the room was renovated, because the doors to the closet were rickety and could not close properly. Similarly there are signs in the public areas like the ground floor toilet (next to the bar) where the cubicles look so old. Even worse was the unrenovated toilet at the 2nd level shopping gallery. It looks so out of place from what a 5-star hotel could provide. For a moment I thought I was in the toilet of some shopping mall in chinatown!

The bathroom was smaller than some I\u2019ve seen but not unbearable so. It was also pristine clean. We were also able to check in late morning without a problem. The hotel\u2019s location on Orchard Road is a plus. Even though the road itself is quite noisy and very busy, you would not know this from your room. Getting about Singapore is a breeze. The MRT public transport system is cheap, efficient, extensive and clean; and if you prefer to take taxis, they are too; But watch out for an additional charge if the hotel calls a taxi for you. We did not try the restaurants. However, the breakfast and pre-dinner titbits and wine are excellent. The staff is excellent and the food is good. In contrast to Hilton executive lounges in the US, wine is complimentary and served by the friendly and excellent staff. They could hardly be more solicitous! Breakfast in the executive lounge is also excellent. Knowing the excellent Changi Palace at the Shangri-La, we did not give the Singapore Hilton a chance for dinner. The only really problems we encountered were to do with internet availability. Our room was on the executive level, but offered no compliementary wireless access. This was only available in the executive lounge, and then only until 8pm. When I questioned the executive lounge manager about both these nonsensical policies I was offered no explanation. I have also questioned the nonsensical absence of wireless in executive rooms in Hiltons in the US, and also received no sensible answer. However, as I say, this was the only real problem at the Singapore Hilton. We visited Little India and had a nice lunch there. Next day, we went on a duck tour of the harbour, which is underwhelming and missable.

I was even more excited to find out we were staying at the Hilton on the famous Orchard Road. Not only that, the company arranged for our daughters, 14 & 16, to have their own room, and we weere put on the business floor so we had access to the lounge. WOW! Well things were not quite as swell as I had imagined. First off they let our reservation go. We had a late arrival and our company rep had not asked for a late check in. So no connecting rooms, and we were in a smoking room. Nicely enough the next day the moved us to a different floor with connecting rooms and non-smoking... but it was a bit of a process. The rooms (all 4 that we saw anyway) were musty and in great need of refurbishing. The business lounge was good and the location easy to get to and from. (most taxi drivers know where to go when you say Hilton) Step out the doors of the Hilton and you are right on the busy street with all the shops and food and people galore. I am not a huge fan of big cities or posh shopping, so there was little to hold my attention directly on Orchard Rd... but the zoo is terrific! The Singapore Flyer was neat, but it is a much longer ride than it needs to be... esp. if you get stuck up there with loads of kids. The hotel buffet breakfast was terrific. Lots of fresh fruits, fresh cooked foods and choices of local or western foods. My daughter was thrilled to have her first piece of dragon fruit frechly peeled and sliced just for her on our first morning there. So while I know that I just must have had my hopes too high, I have to say that I was slightly dissapointed with having stayed at this Hilton. I have been at nicer and cleaner small chain hotels, so for Hilton standards thisone comes up a little short.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cape Town", "Title": "\u201cExceptional hospitality\u201d", "Author": "hopsing", "ReviewID": "UR18347868", "Content": "Spent 2 nights at the Hilton unfortunately stuck in the hotel room with two children having come down with the flu and this being aggravated by an allergy to the feather duvets and pillows in the hotel room.

However, this was simply not true. The room, along with the pillows and bedlinens, all smelled extremely strongly of cigarette smoke - enough to give one a headache after just a few minutes. This siutation was exacerbated by the fact that none of the windows open - so no way to get any kind of natural ventilation at all. The decor in the regular rooms is also pretty dated, and the rooms feel quite dark. The breakfast offered in Oscar's restaurant is decent. Nothing too special or out of the ordinary, but passable.
