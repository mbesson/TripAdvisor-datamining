Where to begin? The staff is fantastic... every single member is friendly, accommodating and helpful; be it the valet, the check-in, the food counter, etc. Kudos to them. The hotel itself is clean, pleasant-looking and functional. The internet was very good throughout the property (note, I paid extra for better internet service). The food counter was very handy for a coffee, or a pizza at night, and the small marketplace (shelves of water, chocolate, chips, etc.) is also great for a quick snack. My king room was clean and, again, functional. Everything that is needed was there. The thermostat was easy to operate. And here's something I absolutely love: More often than not, after spending time removing all the pillows and bedding I don't want, housekeepers usually put everything back on to make everything \"pretty\", which annoys me, because every night I have to go through the same workout removing everything all over again. Not here! Housekeeping blessedly left aside everything I had removed from the bed, so when I was ready to go to bed, I could GO TO BED. Thanks so much for this small, yet very significant practice. And while the hike to the convention center can be a little onerous from this location, it is possible to do it entirely indoors. A few suggestions for improvement: One reviewer is correct in suggesting better shampoo bottles. Also, my king mattress has started sloping to one side, so I couldn't sleep in the middle of the bed. Another reviewer points out the pool is quite small. I did not use it, but could easily see that it is rather tiny. Might be best to replace it with one large hot tub. That would be great!

Valet helped us right away, though we opted to self park(parking is $23, Valet was only $4 more, but I needed to access car a lot.) Parking garage is for all of the Marriott Hotels and is color coded. I found the garage a little confusing (one of the little things). You enter to an elevator which brings you to a hall between Springhill Suites and the Courtyard. The hall is not very welcoming. I can't put my finger on why exactly, but that is the feeling I got. You aren't sure where one hotel begins and one ends. There is a shared pool and exercise room. Another small irritating thing- not only is the pool tiny (very tiny for a shared pool), but there isn't any pool area to sit. My kids and I chose not to swim because of this. I would avoid this hotel if a pool area is important to you. Fitness room again is tiny for 2 hotels and was full every time we passed. The location is great - easy access to the convention center through the beautiful JW Marriott hotel. Right next to the stadium and across the street from White River Park (caution - there was a concert going on that night and we could hear it in our rooms - mainly the \"boom\" - kinda like a loud car stereo, only louder. The park provided a great view from our room. The strangest thing was the elevator. For security, you have to put your room key into the elevator INSIDE to stop on your particular floor. This was a bad experience for us. We were on the second floor. EVerytime we rode with other people, we never got our card in before the 2nd floor was passed. Again, an irritant...Not sure how secure this is, because we could have exited the elevator with any of those other people at the floors above ours, which we got to see quite frequently on our up and down rides. The rooms were great. We had plenty of room and 2 queen beds. There was even a small refrigerator in our room. This is a relatively new hotel and it showed. The bathrooms were a great size and were clean. One thing on checkin - the clerk advised us that breakfast was available in the lobby - she probably should add \"for purchase\"- the way it was presented was that it was complementary and my kids and I completely misunderstood.

The staff was amazing. And the location is ideal for people who want to see Indy on foot. The day after our wedding, my husband and I took a little overnight trip to Indianapolis on a whim. Upon arriving, parking was easy to find and the elevator in the parking garage took us directly to the front desk. While we were checking in, I mentioned to the woman at the front desk that we had just been married. She warmly congratulated us, and noticed that we had booked the zoo package. She informed us that we would find our zoo tickets under our door shortly. Our room was beautiful. It was decorated in a modern Asian style with tasteful wallpaper, pretty framed prints, and a plush, downy king-sized bed. The sheets were so cool and soft, we fell asleep as soon as we laid down, even though it was only about four in the afternoon! Sometime during our nap, the zoo tickets appeared under our door as promised. An envelope marked \"Mr. and Mrs. Wilson\" was also slipped under our door. Inside was a sweet note from the lady at the front desk, congratulating us on our marriage and inviting us to enjoy free breakfast at the bistro in the morning. This was such a pleasant surprise! The front desk also recommended we dine at Weber Grill for dinner, and we were delighted to find that the restaurant was within walking distance. It was a great recommendation and we agreed it was the best meal we had ever eaten. We slept like rocks that night. The room was so quiet and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The next morning, we both showered and the bathroom was amazing. There was beautiful grasscloth wallpaper on the walls, a huge vanity, and a brand new shower. The shower was immaculate (bright white, NO mildew) and the whole place smelled spring-clean! The shower head was top notch and allowed several flow options. And the complimentary toiletries were some kind of botanical brand that smelled heavenly. Breakfast was amazing, and to my amazement, everything was free. Even my Starbucks iced mocha! When we went to check out, the man at the front desk informed us that we were welcome to keep our car parked in the Marriott garage, as the zoo was just across the bridge from the hotel. This saved us having to pay for parking at the zoo, and the walk was beautiful! The staff at this hotel was so courteous and knowledgeable- they made our trip amazing. Some highlights: -Beautiful new flat screen TV in the room with great channel selection. -The bistro across from the front desk serves AMAZING food AND Starbucks coffee. - They keep a beverage dispenser in the lobby filled with orange-infused ice water. It is SUCH a courtesy for guests that are walking to and from the many nearby museums, gardens, and the zoo! It was so appreciated. -TONS of clean towels in the bathrooms. We showered 3 times during our stay and used a clean fresh towel, washcloth, and floor mat each time, and there was still a stack of clean towels left when we checked out. -The hotel had only been open about a year when we stayed there, so everything was really new and clean and modern. -Nice indoor pool and hot tub. -Great security, really friendly, and we had to use the key card to use the elevator, so there isn't a lot of traffic on each floor. The parking garage is also really well-lit. We felt very safe during our stay. -Amazing staff. They went above and beyond to ensure that we had an amazing stay.

In all fairness, I had obtained the reservation for two nights from an online discount site. While the price paid was more than fair, staying at this hotel took a little work. I was greeted by a very competent front desk clerk who allowed me to choose the type of room I preferred (two queens versus a king). Unfortunately, the first room I was assigned had mildew stains on the sheets and a stain on the arm of the couch. I was promptly assigned me a new room, which was quiet, roomy and well-appointed enough to forgive the view of the construction site below. The hotel overall was very clean and well kept. However, it was the tiny things that made my stay a little more stressful than needed: - First of all, parts of the garage were blocked off and finding my way out with the poorly marked exit signs was a challenge. -When I desired the coffee advertised in the room booklet as free in the lobby, it wasn't there one evening during the designated time. The cheerful front desk staff gave me a cup but wasn't aware it was printed in the booklet. -After purchasing the hummus, pita chips and celery from the small cafe late one night, I had to make an extra trip from down from my sixth floor room after opening the box and realizing the order wasn't correct. I had been simply given hummus and tortilla chips, which was disappointing. The very nice young lady at the counter did apologize and fixed the order promptly. -At check out, another young lady didn't seem able to maneuver the computer very easily and couldn't provide a receipt promptly. (She realized they had forgotten to include the parking charges and she was attempting to add them. However, my own honesty at clarifying my stay was for two nights, rather than one also added yet another $20 to my bill.) After watching the young lady struggle with the computer, I indicated I had a meeting and another woman at the counter said they would email the receipt to me. -Seven hours later after not receiving the emailed receipt, I had to call and request one. It was promptly emailed. All these little corrections made the hotel stay more work than it needed to be. Would I pay full price or recommend someone stay here. I am not sure. However, it was the kindness one morning of a front desk clerk that was greatly appreciated. I had burned my neck accidentally on the hairdryer the first morning and came down looking for burn cream. Although they didn't have any, she also noticed I was looking for coffee in the lobby and insisted on giving me a cup. This simple act and her cheerful attitude in engaging me in conversation later in the day was the Marriott service I'd expected. As a side note regarding wireless, I'd recommend using the provided ethernet line, rather than the wireless. The wireless seemed to be slower and sometimes unreliable.
