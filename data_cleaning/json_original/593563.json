We were on the ground floor and the bathroom flooded as soon as the shower went on. It was also a bit smelly and had not been aired. However they were very full so I think we were stuck in the one of the last available rooms - other members of our tour group had much nicer rooms... so best advice is definitely worth staying just don't stay on the ground floor. Owner very nice and spoke good English. Staff eager to please. Pizza place next door very convenient, also has internet access... 20 minute walk (max)Tianamen Square, Forbidden Palace, Acrobat Theatre. Supermarket round the corner. Not much nightlife if you are hoping to go out after all the sightseeing.", "Date": "Sep 3, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR258076626", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "D0ylie"}, {"Content": "perfect choice We booked this hotel after reading other reviews, and i must say it was better than we expected the hotle was close to the Temple of heaven.

It is only a 20 minute walk to Tianan Men Square and is across from the Temple of Heaven. Close by there is a traditional department store, a grocery market and a wonderful park where you can see people fly their kites. But the best thing about the location is that it is not in a tourist area and you can walk around and not see another westerner. Yet we always felt safe. The Chinese were friendly and keen to try out their limited English. The hotel itself was very good. The room was very large, good breakfast (with real English tea) and there was a little cafe next door that served western food as well as Chinese. We will definitely stay here again.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR619953615", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Friendly and clean       Clean bed", "Date": "Apr 29, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR644186347", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "erichschlaikjer"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d593563-r16228382-RJ_Brown_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "593563", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
