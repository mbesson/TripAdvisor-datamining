The location is good; it is only a few blocks away from the cathedral and the zocalo, as well as bellas artes concert hall, which are some of the most famous tourist destinations in Mexico City.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Fe, New Mexico", "Title": "\u201cService doesn't reflect Mexico's kindness...\u201d", "Author": "mouleyfrites", "ReviewID": "UR93632493", "Content": "Good location; funny electronics street (each street in this area is devoted to some kind of technology or product: plumbing or electronics, bathroom fitting or vacuum cleaners. Kinda fun!). No good restaurants or bars at night (our beverage option - aside from manly man cantinas was to buy big beers through a barred security window at the Oxxo down the street - queuing with a rather scary cast of late-night characters...). Front desk clerks just got meaner every day. Don't know why. I speak Spanish, and tried really hard to be polite and respectful - even after our door broke and we were locked in our room! I think they don't like foreign visitors much. On our last day, an important friend sent a messenger to pick up the sunglasses he had left with us by mistake, and the desk clerk sent the messenger away - saying we had left the hotel - knowing we we would return in five minutes (she arranged our taxi for us and knew our schedule). Just plain mean-spirited. If they call you a taxi, establish the fare before you agree. They don't use real drivers - just friends of the hotel - and - while they can be sweet, they quadruple charge! The desk clerks have never heard the term 'radio taxi,' they say. Rooms: The outside-facing rooms are unbearably noisy. Inside rooms are small and dark - but clean and pleasant. I really like a hotel in Mexico to reflect a little of Mexico - whether through aesthetics and architecture or in the typically Mexican warmth and kindness of those who work there. This place offers neither. Restaurant staff = fun. Breakfast was nice - but a bit pricey, and nothing like free breakfasts I have had at other places in Mexico. Disappointing. If the staff had been nice all would have been fine.", "Date": "January 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Puebla", "Title": "\u201cBeware the bell boys!!

We paid $430 peso per night for a double room. The street where the Hotel is located is very busy during the day and if you arrive at night the surrounding area is a bit rundown, but the Hotel entrance is a welcome gem in what first appears as a not so good area. Hotel staff spoke little English which made communicating hard, but they really worked hard to please you. Safety deposit boxes were available at the front desk, hotel has its own resturant and there are many alternate choices within two blocks. About 10 minute walk from the main square and in the historic district. we walked out many times both day and night without incident. They have computers with internet access for a fee. Several 24hr food places within 2 blocks.

Rooms are quite small and a little on the musty side, the shower pressure is very poor and soundproofing is non-existent. We were kept awake all night due to our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcneighbours\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 snoring and the next guests that moved in knew we were from Australia because they could hear us on a telephone call. There are no fridges in the rooms which makes it hard to keep any food. There is also no air-conditioning, which wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem for us as we were there in winter but I would imaging the rooms would get hot during summer. There is a Metro station about 3 blocks away from the hotel but as first timers to Mexico City we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the location was all that suitable to tourists, the hotel is situated on a street of electrical shops \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if you need a remote control, a TV or a memory card you are set, however, if you are after food, a laundry or anything else you will have to venture further. We arrived late afternoon and didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel safe to go exploring in the dark so we had dinner in the hotel, the food is below average and slow to arrive but the restaurant staff are real characters. Once we were more familiar with the area we explored a little further and found some decent restaurants and shops, having said that ,we tried to be off the streets and back in the hotel by 9pm. I believe Zona Rosa is a better option if you want to feel more at ease. Some reception staff were helpful, others didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to know you or tell you anything. For example, we learn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t on our last day that if you put down a refundable deposit they gave you a remote control to enable the cable service on the television \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which means you receive English speaking channels. They have 3 computers with very reasonably priced internet access available for guests, there was a number of times we wanted to use them and they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t working, but the problems were normally rectified in under an hour. This hotel is reasonably priced and comfortable enough for a one night stay, for a longer period I would recommend looking elsewhere.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "leganes", "Title": "\u201cgood hotel and good deal\u201d", "Author": "patanete", "ReviewID": "UR19836182", "Content": "I come to this hotel almost every year from 2004 after reading the first review in TripAdvisor.Here is mine.

Desk people are very friendly,I can say it,there are three internet terminals,but not cheap.And a restaurant that looks uninspiring,but I never use it,can\u00c2\u00b4t talk about it,but there are endless options outside,althought by night many restaurants close early Well,and the better thing is the price,look into their website.", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gloucester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cConvinient and clean\u201d", "Author": "KINGKONG3", "ReviewID": "UR11286679", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel as part of a tour, so I can't comment on prices.
