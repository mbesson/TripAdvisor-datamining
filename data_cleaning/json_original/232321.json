First Location This hotel is near Rozengracht and extremely central to most Amsterdam activities. Walking nearly everywhere was not an issue to say the least. It is surrounded by great shopping ( go a block in just about any direction) and some really great rated TA restaurants are all within a few blocks. There are close main line bus stops if going a further distance (google maps does have public transit guides so just tell it where you want to go to and from and what time to leave and it will tell you what transit to take). The canal it is on is pretty quiet and a lovely view. The Hotel Itself The hotel is a collection of multi-story buildings that are side by side and tied together. It looks amazing, especially if you are in to elegant architecture and decor. It has been expanded over the years and only gotten better. They have a library ( full of books of authors that have stayed there and guest books of all the famous people they have had in their decades), a sitting room, a large dining area, business center (two computers, printer, etc), and a meeting room (along with a few others you probably can accidentally find!). All have grand furniture that is extremely antique and well maintained and the art is very nice also. You just do not find hotels decorated like this any more. The halls are a bit narrow (one person or a squeeze), and while there is an elevator you could end up with one or two half flights of stairs to get to your room (sometimes up and down even!). So while a bit annoying getting to the room the bag boys will take care of your bags, and its really a minor walk. Finding everything in the hotel can sometimes be a bit confusing as the hotel facilities are a bit scattered, any questions through and the front desk is happy to help. The Hotel Room The hotel room is as elegant as the rest of the hotel, and the bathroom is right there with it. Towel heaters, heated tiles, nice counters, and nice shower. The room might be a slight bit on the small side but still enough room for two people in one of their small rooms with a few suitcases I believe. Bed was very good and got some great sleep. While the breakfast is a bit pricey it may be worthwhile as its quite the spread and served in a very elegant area. There are cheaper options but for a nice time at the hotel it certainly is recommended. There is free wifi throughout the hotel and it worked well. The hotel staff seemed friendly enough and the frontdesk was always very helpful (and can be used to buy various local things like bus and tram passes too). When you leave you are expected to leave your key with the frontdesk and they will hand it back to you when you return (its got a big bell on it so far better than carrying it!).

There was complimentary water and fruit in the room which was nice surprise because in a supposedly 5 star hotel in Venice recently we paid 7.50 Euros for a bottle of water from the mini bar!. The 'double' bed was two singles pushed together however when we asked they did make them up as a double which saved us slipping down the gap in the middle of the night! The bathroom was modern and clean and included such things as a magnifying make up mirror, a powerful separate shower and underfloor heating - bliss! One criticism would be the lack of fluffy white towels, the towels were grey hard and had definitely seen better days. At first glance breakfast seems expensive at 17.50 Euros however for that you get fruit, yoghurt and cereals, a bread basket with croissants and four kinds of bread and a plate of cooked meats and cheese in addition to this you can have eggs and bacon or pancakes that are cooked to order.

I was impressed even before I got to the hotel! In setting up my reservation, I had asked for restaurant recommendations and received an email with a list. Reservations for dinner at two different restaurants were arranged by the hotel for a couple of the nights I was staying there, taking that one task off my mind. Staff - from the concierge to the cleaning personnel - were all friendly, helpful and made me feel very welcome. The hotel itself has much character. While everything is modern in the hotel rooms, the decor is reminiscent of past times. Modern artwork hangs on the walls, but the feel is of a grand, traditional hotel. Breakfast, which costs approximately EUR 17.50 is served in the elegant breakfast room with a view of the canal through large windows. The breakfast spread is very generous with many options including cereals, fruit, smoked salmon and trout, tomatoes, cucumbers, a platter of cheeses and deli meats, breads... the list goes on. You can also order eggs to your liking, as well as pancakes. The location of the Ambassade Hotel makes it perfect for tourists, as it's close to many of the main areas - the Centrum, Western Canal district, Jordaan, and the Museumplein.

This is a fantastic, well run establishment. The staff were so helpful and friendly, the room was amazing, wonderful bathroom, fantastic view of the canal, we were on the 2nd floor. Huge double bed which was very comfortable. Someone in a previous review complained about the lack of air-conditioning? Ours worked perfectly well, and it was needed as it was so hot. The decor in the hotel is truly wonderful, lots of lovely paintings around the hotel, beautiful library, lovely lounge areas, beautiful fabrics. A lot of thought has gone into the design and layout. Yes the breakfast was really delicious, never had such a wide range of choices and all excellent. Even did a cooked breakfast which is quite unusual for Continental hotels. Well recommended. We only had two days in Amsterdam and felt that we needed more time. There are so many things to see. We visited the Anne Frank house and museum, a truly inspirational and moving experience. Needed a large handkerchief!!! We visited the Van Gogh museum which is also a must. Unfortunately didn't have time to visit many of the other sights as we really needed more time in order to do them justice. The canal trip is worth doing, there are various companies that do this but I think they are more or less the same. There is one that does a museum hop on hop off tour which I think must be worth doing - there's a lot of walking to do in Amsterdam and this sort of trip must take the pain out of aching feet! The attractions are not necessarily close to each other, so plan your day before you go out, Amsterdam is bigger than you think! Beware, if you've never been to Amsterdam before, watch out for bikes and trams. The cyclists seem to have right of way over pedestrians and speed around the city regardless of people! So make sure you watch your step and always look before you step out; watch out for the trams too! There are plenty of restaurants and bars to choose from, spoilt for choice really. Make sure you try one of the pancake houses, delicious.

I could only afford one night here, it's extremely expensive (my visa bill came in at $500 for one night - I think my rate was 295 euros + taxes), and we had a double room, canal view - but I'm glad we splurged because there's something about staying on the canal and especially on the Herengracht Canal - it's a lovely area for walking (well, all of AMS is good for walking), and we walked to a little restaurant where we were able to eat canal-side (it rained much of the week we were in Amsterdam). The rooms are lovely and in the process of being re-done; breakfast is superb - my husband went to the restaurant and I enjoyed room-service while I sat by the open window and watched people cycling by. The cons of being so close to the street and to the water is the noise at night - but we were fine, there wasn't too much noise the night we were there. While yes it's a labyrinth, it's charming and up and down and all over the place. I just love this hotel but I'm afraid I'll likely not ever be able to afford to go back.

The hotel offers a great breakfast buffet which while not particularly cheap, is good value for money and of a high standard. There are plenty of options including fruit, cold cuts and cheese, yoghurt, cereals, toast conserves and cooked options such as bacon and eggs made to order. It was slightly disappointing that the hotel lacked a bar for use in the evening but room service can bring up drinks to the room and it's great to watch the world go by on the canal with a drink at the end of a long day. Staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful and were able to offer tips and advice on where to eat, drink and take in the sights. They can also arrange taxis to Centraal Station or other locations in the city.

We picked the hotel because of many good reviews and because of it's location. It is in a nice area of town, one block off a main shopping street but a classic canal zone neighborhood. The hotel consists of series of linked row houses that have been converted into hotel suites. We had one deluxe suite for my wife and I and what they call a triple for the kids (a \"living room\") and a main bedroom. Given that the buildings date to the 1700s they have done a remarkable job keeping them modern. All have free wifi. The bathrooms are updated and the heating and cooling work well. The people there were polite and usually helpful but professional. The breakfasts were extra but worth every penny with a nice buffet and cooked to order eggs. The breakfast area is charming and bright. On the down side, the windows in our room were far from soundproof and Amsterdam rocks on weekends. Even in our neighborhood, partygoers were in the streets until 3 or 4 am and they SING! It is also not cheap, although we felt it was reasonably valued.

Traveled to Amsterdam with my two girls (7 & 10) for a long weekend and found this hotel was absolutely perfect. Called the hotel to book directly and the reservationist was excellent. We wanted a top notch room and she suggested a suite with a king bed and rollaway to accomdate us. Our room was right on the canal with a huge window that gave us views of all the boats. We had two floors with a bedroom on top and living space below. The kids loved the cool staircase. We actually entered on the street so it was almost like living in an apartment in the city which was very cool too. Two of us shared the bed and the rollaway was in the living room below with room to spare for seating and tv. Travelling with kids can be hairy sometimes and the hotel was very relaxed and accomodating to my kids. Since my husband didn't join us on this trip, my kids sent daily emails from the small but efficient business center and no one raised an eyebrow about kids on the computers. The front desk was also helpful in securing tickets to some of the big ticket attractions. The kids forgot to mail thier postcards on our last day and the front desk even offered to send them out for us. The hotel's location was ideal . There were plenty of restaurants surrounding the hotel so no matter which way we went exploring, we were never at a loss of where to eat. Right around the corner was a busy square with tons of cafes with outdoor tables. The location was ideal for sightseeing too. A very short walk away were a host of must see sights. In fact, everything was so central to the hotel we rarely had to rely on taxis or public transportation. In fact, the public transportion was so clean and easy to navigate that it became our main mode of travel. A main tram hub was right around the corner so that was super convenient and there were plenty of shops right there to buy the tickets. Several tram lines also made frequent stops on the streets surrounding the hotel so we were always able to hop on and off within a few minutes walk of the hotel. Some of the attractions my kids loved, and all within walking distance, were the Ann Frank museum, the Houseboat Museum, drinking hot chocolate at the myriad of canal side cafes and buying our daily snack of french fries in the square by the Ann Frank museum. By tram, we visited the zoo, had dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe and rented bikes to ride at Vongel park. We rented bikes on our last day and regretted not renting for the entire time we were there. Lots of bikes, and very few cars make for a great and safe way to explore the city. Each night my kids ordered bedtime hot chocolate from room service and we found the service to be prompt and very cordial. We ate breakfast in the hotel once but it was too quiet and stuffy for my kids so we decided to grab breakfast around the hotel. There was also a supermarket near the houseboat museum so we stocked up on snacks and made use of the fridge in our suite. Amsterdam was the perfect trip for my kids who found lots of fun and fascinating things to discover and the Ambassde was the ideal place to stay. It offered us the comfort and level of service we expect from hotels but was unique enough to escape the generic hotel room syndrome.

Nice modern bathrooms. 9. It's on the Herengracht Canal and away from the younger tourist insanity. 8. Some rooms have their own entrances--it's like having your own apartment in Amsterdam. 7. Free internet in rooms and they also have a computer that guests can use to check email if you didn't bring your own laptop. 6. It's quiet and elegant. 5. 24 hour room service for drinks, snacks, and ice! 4. Romantic canal views can make any stay feel like a second honeymoon. 3. Each room is unique. Will you have a winding staircase? A balcony overlooking the canal? 2. The beds are very comfy. It's delightful to sleep in with the morning breeze coming in from the open window. 1. The staff! They are extremely helpful, discrete and make great restaurant recommendations. I spent 8 months organizing a group of friends to travel to Amsterdam to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday.

There was a modern bathroom and other amenities you would expect but the atmosphere and the look remained traditional Amsterdam.

Unlike some Amsterdam hotels that have essentially gutted historic canal house structures, leaving a sterile building covered by a thin veneer of historic facade, the Ambassade respects the original 17th century structure. The public rooms have high ceilings, cut crystal chandeliers, ornate woodwork, and impressive reproduction antique furniture. There are small nooks and crannys, such as the rooms off the lobby that house computers for guest use and a library filled with books signed by authors who have stayed at the hotel. (The latter is a lot of fun for book enthusiasts.) Guest rooms have expansive windows looking out onto the Herengracht (Gentleman's Canal) or the Single canal. On the other hand, there are few elevators and the stairs are extraordinarily steep by North American standards. Do yourself a favor and have the bellman deliver your luggage to the room! Besides the architecture, I enjoyed the hotel's location, my room's high-quality amenities, and the superb service. The hotel was a brisk 20-minute (or less) walk from literally anyplace I was interested in going in Amsterdam: the museum quarter, the floating flower market, pedestrian shopping streets, the nightlife of the Leidesplein, great restaurants, historic canal house museums, and the central train station. Plus, it was only a block from an Albert Hein supermarket that stocked ready-made sandwiches and snacks. The hotel is in an affluent area and I felt comfortable walking by myself at night (and I am female). The rooms contained high-thread-count sheets, quality toiletries, and free wireless internet. A welcome snack of two apples and two bottles of mineral water awaited me. The room was surprisingly spacious and light-filled. The Ambassade offers 24 hour room service and very helpful staff. Several of the front desk clerks were greeting me by name from the second day on. They made dinner reservations for me, offered to print out boarding passes, pointed out the nearest grocery store location, and (when I complained about the weight of my laptop computer) offered to deliver my computer to my business location! For people who like the spa experience, the Koan Float spa associated with the hotel is only two doors away. The Ambassade has had an excellent reputation for many years.

The staff could not have been more helpful and pleasant, packing me off with an umbrella when it was wet and windy and welcoming me back with a smile at any hour of the evening. All my business related enquiries were speedily answered and resolved. A small meeting room was arranged at a moment's notice - and a flask of coffee arrived unbidden. The rooms are small but perfectly adequate and well equipped. I would suggest that the layout of the hotel across several floors and featuring countless small flights of stairs would make it a poor choice for the elderly but - for anyone else - the higgledy piggledy nature of the place adds to its charm.

Located right on one of Amsterdam's famous canals in a great location within walking distance to almost everything. We were shown to a room that was not in the same building as the lobby, but a couple of doors down the street. It appeared to me that there were only three suites in this building. I say \"suite\" because we had separate living and bedroom areas. Access to this building was with a card key, and I liked that we never had to pass by reception on our way in or out..... it gave us a feeling of almost having our own private Amsterdam apartment. The living room was downstairs and the bedroom was on the upper level, reached by a VERY steep and narrow spiral staircase. This suite would not be for everyone, but I assume the front desk man must have estimated our ages and decided that we looked fit enough to get up and down the stairs. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the upstairs bedroom had an air conditioning unit in it because it was fairly hot when we were there in August. Both rooms looked into a very small inner courtyard with no view of anything which was fine with me because we wanted to sleep late every morning and it appeared this would be a very quiet room. But appearances can be deceiving..... Despite having a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door, I was awakened early the first morning to the sound of loud whistling downstairs. I tried to ignore it but it just wouldn't stop. Finally, I got out of bed, went down the stairs and opened the front door. The maid cleaning the room across the hall had the door propped open and she was whistling some tune very, very loudly !!! When she stepped outside into the hallway, I politely asked her if she could \"hold it down\" as someone was still trying to sleep upstairs. I was wide awake now and couldn't go back to sleep. The next morning, I was hoping there would be a different maid or at least one a little quieter, but I woke up the second morning to knocking and clanging and banging in the hallway outside that went on for about twenty minutes. I lost my temper and stormed down the stairs, rudely asking the maid to please stop making so much noise as we were trying to sleep. The hallway was very large with a high ceiling and marble floor so there was lots of echo out there... it wasn't entirely the maid's fault although she seemed to make very little effort to be quiet even though we had our \"Do not disturb\" sign on the door every morning. I considered asking to change rooms, but we were only staying three nights so I decided I could live with it. For this reason alone I would hesitate to stay here again unless they could give me a room with a carpeted, quieter hallway outside. They should also instruct their housekeeping staff to avoid \"whistling while they work\" especially outside rooms where the occupants have requested not to be disturbed. In every other respect though, the hotel was fantastic and a very pleasurable experience. If you do not need to sleep late in the mornings, you will most likely be very satisfied with this hotel. Aside from the housekeeping woman, I was extremely pleased with the service of the staff. It seems that they are very eager to handle all requests for food or beverage delivered to the room any hour of the day or night. Everyone was extremely pleasant and helpful.

I will confess that I am pretty fussy when it comes to hotel rooms; it's my favorite part of the trip and I want it to be lovely. The Ambassade did not disappoint in any way, from the property, to the location, to the staff. The property and location: The title says it all, the hotel sits like a dignified gentleman on the Herengract (Gentleman's) canal. (I think I read that somewhere before, but I don't remember where... ) The location is perfect, less than a 10 minute walk from Dam Square, and right at the fringes of the \"Nine Little Streets\" shopping district. It seems as though everything is at your fingertips, from restaurants to the tram, and even a cheese shop (high on my list). The lounges, library, and breakfast room are all very accessible and comfortable. The room: I was a bit worried about the size of the room - being that it is in an old canal house, and the standard size of a European hotel room is typically smaller than in the US, but the size of our double room was perfectly fine. You couldn't practice your ballroom dancing, but you weren't squeezing by the furniture as you walked around it either. We had a standard European king bed (which was 2 twin mattresses with a common headboard, so beware the abyss) which was very comfortable, two big fluffy pillows each, and we each had our own twin-sized duvet. The room was also furnished with a desk and chair, 2 nightstands, a TV / stand, and two large-seated, comfy armchairs with a marble-topped coffee table. Our Room 45 overlooked the canal, through large wall-to-wall windows. The housekeeping staff kept it immaculate throughout our stay, I'd swear they changed the sheets and duvet every day! The staff: By far, the greatest asset to the Ambassade is their staff. Besides the meticulous maids, the reception desk is generous, accommodating, and personal.

We were disappointed but decided not to make a fuss but instead get out and enjoy the city immediately. That night we could hardly sleep. The room was very hot and had no air conditioning. We tried to leave the window open but had to close it because - being below street level - the noise outside was very loud. In the morning we asked for another room. We were moved with no difficulty whatsoever which makes me think that many people complain about this room. The second room we got (Room 72) was lovely. It was on the first floor overlooking the canal and had air conditioning. It was great to be able to lie in bed and watch the boats go by on the canal. To make up for our dissatisfaction with the original room, we were offered complimentary breakfast. This was a very nice goodwill gesture because breakfast is expensive in the hotel. The hotel itself is in an excellent location and the standard of decor and cleanliness was very good. The staff were polite and helpful.

While we did not expect to have our room available at 7:30 in the morning, the reception we received was warm and accommodating. They offered to hold our luggage for us, and provided extensive information on the city sites. As well, they suggested we make dinner reservations for that evening as the many restaurants in that area often fill up on a Saturday night. They made several recommendations, and offered to call at a later time once the establishment we had chosen would be open. We also expressed interest in attending a concert at Amsterdam's reknowned concert hall the following day, and they offered to make the necessary inquiry while we were out during the morning. As check out time for the hotel is noon, they could not confirm the room we requested would be available before early to mid afternoon, although they would put a special rush on it once it was available. They invited us to relax in the lounge if we were so inclined, but we opted to go out and explore the city. Needless to say, the charm of Amsterdam captivated us and we did not return until approximately 1:30 that afternoon, only to find the room was indeed ready for us and our luggage already placed in the room. As well, our dinner reservations were confirmed for the time requested (and the restaurant was indeed full that evening and numerous parties were turned away if they had not made reservations), and concert tickets had been put on hold for us for pick-up either later that day or early on the following day of the performance. The concert seating was perfect, and we could not have asked for better seats, despite the venue being all but sold out. Upon arrival to the room, there were absolutely no disappointments. Beautifully done, subtle touches, and while slightly on the smaller side as compared to many North American hotel rooms, the attention to comfort and detail was evident in every way. I rarely give full marks to any establishment, but the Ambassade and its staff more than exceded our expectations. Without any hesitation we will definitely stay there again on future visits, and would absolutely recommend this hotel to both leisure and business travellers. The one caveat is that the hotel would not be appropriate for families with young children or persons with mobility issues. The property is indeed a true remodelling of existing canal homes, and access can be difficult given the steep stairs found in some instances.

Over the course of both stays, the staff was incredibly accomodating and friendly. The hotel itself is what you would expect from the websites and reviews here: a series of beautiful canal homes on the Herengracht, slightly quirky and in what we considered to be the best and most convenient part of Amsterdam. The quirkiness is a result of connecting 10 separate homes. But, unless you can't navigate stairs (unfortunately, none of the rooms appeared suitable for a disabled person) or would like to have 5+ rooms next to each other, we didn't find the lay out to pose any problem. Each time we were there, we had canal view rooms consistent with our request. The first, room 73, had beautiful views up and down the canal. Beds are the seemingly standard for all but the high-end business hotels in Europe (i.e., on the small side and two singles pushed together). Plenty of room in the bathroom and amazing water pressure. The second visit, they upgraded us to a suite, room 20. The room was right off the street and slightly below street level. This meant we had our own door to the canal and it felt like you had your own apartment. The downside is the ceilings are about 6'2\" and the shower was a bit of a squeeze. Being on the street also increased the noise, although we found this area of Amsterdam to be very quiet (other than the bomb-like fireworks that are set off all over the city all day on New Years Eve - we got used to them, but it was a little unnerving at first). I'd agree with the comments that breakfast probably isn't worth the price given what's available at nearby bakeries and restaurants, but it looked very good and it's certainly worth visiting the breakfast room and lounge.

The room service was great too! They had fantastic salads and the pot of coffee we ordered each morning came with cookies and other sweet treats. We aren't big breakfast eaters, so we did not try their breakfast. There is market close by, a *terrific* sandwich shop about a 3 minute walk away (on the corner Rosmarijnsteeg and Spuistraat although I cannot remember the name), and Cafe Luxemburg is a great place to hang out. Amsterdam is a beautiful city and we will definitely be staying at the Ambassade again on our next visit.", "Date": "March 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cThe place to be\u201d", "Author": "stbo2000fr", "ReviewID": "UR4599858", "Content": "Right in the center, close (walking distance) to everything you had to see in Amsterdam, bathroom is very, very clean.

The room was spacious and clean with great views of the canal. The staff were friendly and spoke great English. It's centrally located and all the major attractions are within walking distance. I would however recommend that you go elsewhere for breakfast - we found it to be very expensive and there are so many great cafes around that there is no need to pay over the odds.
