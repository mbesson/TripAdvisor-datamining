{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Does what is its says on the tin! We stayed at the toyoko inn in Asakusa as part of an arranged tour of Japan. The rooms were small by western standard, but probably about average for Japan. Room was clean and well presented, hotel staff were friendly and overall our three night stay was exactly what we expected. There is a small area to side of the lobby where a basic breakfast is served, although there are convenience stores within a few minutes walk. There is also a vending machine in reception for drinks and beer.The hotel is reasonably located for metro (about 7 minutes walk to each of the nearest stops on the Ginza line), the temple at Asakusa and the local area.", "Date": "Oct 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR426610134", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "zippy_finch"}, {"Content": "Good choice Toyoko Inn is a chain hotel located all over Japan. We stayed at Toyoko Inn Asasuka in Tokyo and again in Kyoto. It was immaculately clean and neat. The room is tiny but has all the amenity you need while traveling. The bathroom had shampoo, conditioner, body soap, toothbrush, razors, comb, towels. You can pick up a shower cap from front desk counter as well as cable for internet connection in your room. Or you can use the computer in the lobby. Rooms do not have closets. Luggage can be stored under the bed. It does have hair dryer and iron. Bathroom is tiny. Two ppl will not fit in there unless one is in the shower. They do offer free Japanese breakfast which was decent. Their rules: drop off key at front desk whenever you leave the hotel. No one is allow in the hotel between 10am (check out) and 4pm (check in). That is their lock out time so they can clean. I was extremely impress w/ the cleanliness of the entire hotel. We made use of their coin laundry as well. Overall, I would definitely stay here again, in any of their hotel chain. Both chain we stayed in Tokyo and Kyoto were exactly alike. Oh, they also provide slippers and night gowns. And their toilets are bidet..w/ butt wash and all...very cool experience!", "Date": "Jan 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR224514718", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "toothfairy28"}, {"Content": "Great value. I spent two weeks at this hotel during the cherry blossom viewing season. For the price it is great value for money. Rooms were always clean and fresh towels supplied. Free internet in the lobby for hotel guests.

The area of Asakusa where this hotel is situated is regarded as what is left of traditional Tokyo. We found it a satisfying mix of both modern and traditional, very safe and lots of pleasant surprises around nearly every corner. The waterbus and underground station are close to each other and are about a slow ten/fifteen minute walk away. The underground is quite easy to master and all parts of the city can be accessed with maybe a few train changes but it is really simple to travel on this transport system.The hotel itself is a medium sized building (we think), the staff are very pleasant and speak a little English. When we first checked in we were given some small gifts such as a hand towel, camera carrying strap with the hotel\u9225\u6a9a logo upon it and a lady\u9225\u6a9a cosmetic kit \u9225?unexpected but very nice.We found the hotel very clean and efficiently run. Our room was fairly small with two single beds, a bedside cabinet, air-con, table, chair, clock, phone, hair dryer, small fridge, electric kettle and tea making facilities. An iron and ironing board were available from reception if required. There was a balcony, and an en-suit bathroom that was supplied with clean towels every day. Our view from the balcony overlooked the main street, which was okay for us. Considering we were in a hotel overlooking the main road in a large busy city we found our room very quite and had no trouble with noise.As far as hotels go we would definitely stay here again. The charges were very reasonable compared to other hotels in the area and in the city as a whole. In fact when I first booked this hotel on the Internet, I looked at the price and had doubts, thinking maybe it would be a run-down grotty place, but no, it was quite the opposite and an extremely pleasing base from which to explore Tokyo from.", "Date": "Dec 31, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR917289540", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Saucebrick"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066461-d530893-r5937801-Toyoko_Inn_Asakusa_Senzoku-Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "530893", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
