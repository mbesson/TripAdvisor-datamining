The room was quite small and did not have any chairs to sit on which was quite frustrating. Also, the air conditioning wasnt very powerful hence my sleep wasnt as comfortable as it should have been. The room does have a slight musky smell, probably due to poor ventilation. The television is attached to the wall, but it can only be watched from the head of the bed because of the angle it was positioned. The channels were pretty limited. The good stuff were that it is clean, they change your towels everyday (not sure about the sheets), and they provided us with 2 bottles of complimentary water each day. There is free wifi, but i was unable to access it from my room, only when i was in the lobby. The lobby is unimpressive as it is so small and there is no where to sit. It can literally only accommodate 4 or 5 people. Not very practical. There are quite a few good food places around the hotel though, the best one being the Beach Rd Prawn Mee (apparently a popular one with the locals). Other good things include the bus stop being walking distance to the hotel, with buses going straight to orchard rd. But the closest MRT is Eunos, which is still 20 minutes away, and not really walking distance, hence pretty inconvenient. Overall, I would recommend Le Peranakan to people who are confident with traveling and exploring singapore with ample time, but not for those who want to be close to the city centre (Le Peranakan is approx. a 35 - 40 minute (peak time) or 25 - 30 minute (off-peak) bus ride from Orchard Rd)", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia", "Title": "\u201cSmall Rooms but Great Quality!\u201d", "Author": "Anonymous1337", "ReviewID": "UR114589052", "Content": "The Single Room was rather tight, but I really didn't mind because everything else was perfect.

Housekeeping is done every day, which include fresh floor mat, bath and face towel changes as well as daily bottled water supply. There are usually one or two staff members on duty each time, but they do very well in responding to the customers' every need. Another plus point is the free, unlimited WIFI internet facility.

Their cheapest rooms do not have windows. They are so small that I under estimated it completely. I travelled with my son and his stroller and 3 bags. I couldnt even get 1 bag in there. Had to keep as a pile and 2 bags in their store room. They fit in a bed with hardly 1 feet of walking space around it before you end up in a small bathroom. Their superior rooms would be more roomy but I can't comment. Their day-time manager couldnt upgrade us because none higher end rooms were available.. neither could he move us to some little better window less rooms (apparently they have of different sizes). At night, another manager was there (a lady) who was super duper nice to us. She realized that it is a nightmare to stay in that small gibber room. Although she wouldnt upgrade us to higher grade room, she was kind enough to give us a room for Physically challenged. So since you need to have access for wheel chair, atleast the room size grew and we got some space. What a relief. Most of the lower end rooms in Singapore are small and incredibly small. So this is nothing indifferent. I would suggest this hotel for other better reasons and bigger rooms if available.. For solo travellers with just a Backpack this room is also ideal and cheap. For Indian families, I would suggest Claremont Hotel in little India area where they would get Indian food and bigger rooms for same price. Away from main downtown.

The rooms are on the small side, about half of which do not have windows, but this is noted when you reserve through the hotel's own website.

We lived in the area years ago and so wanted to stay somewhere nearby. The hotel occupies the second floors of two renovated rows of shophouses. It opened in mid-late 2009, so everything was almost brand new during our stay. The room we had was comfortable and it provided for our needs - a comfortable bed, clean sheets and a warm shower. The place is decorated to look Peranakan (an ethnic group in the region with Chinese and local Malayan cultures), though this was mostly for flavor. One building had an elevator going up from the reception to the 2nd floor. The building we stayed in did not. The rooms are small, and our bathroom in particular was strangely built - there was only a small gap between the toilet seat and the wall, and the shower door opened about halfway before colliding into the sink. The shower pressure was very strong and it took some adjusting to get it to a reasonable pressure. The walls are also rather thin - at one point a family was staying in the next room and we could hear them talking. Some rooms also have no windows, so be sure to specify your preference if you dislike the idea of a windowless room. There is free wireless internet but it was rather slow - enough to check emails but not much more. The hotel is in a nice area that is outside of the major financial and shopping districts. It is within walking distance to East Coast beach and the cultural neighborhoods of Katong and Joo Chiat. There are lots of places to eat nearby that are open at all hours of the day, and you can get a bus to town or to the nearest subway station. Or catch a cab. If you are used to staying at budget B&Bs and backpacker's, the hotel is like a newer version of such places. Is it entirely adequate at providing a comfortable place to rest at the end of a long day. If you don't intend to spend much time in the hotel, and you want to stay somewhere away from the mad rush of Orchard, then it might be a good choice.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Le Peranakan Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1547084-Reviews-Le_Peranakan_Hotel-Singapore.html", "Price": "$72 - $96*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">400 East Coast Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Katong District</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">428994</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1547084", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/06/d2/06d283d76decfe9e08c835ee3fd22bf71large.jpg"}}
