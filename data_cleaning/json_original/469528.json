So it might just be that the city isn't our style, so take from this review what you will. My wife and I have traveled a lot, and of the 6 hotels we stayed at in this last Europe trip (all of which were between ($110 & $150 euros per night...we don't do fancy) this was the only one we struggled with. While it is clean, it does not have the characteristics of its 3 star hotel rating. Minor examples are that It does not have TV except to pay, they only change the towels every two days (3.00 charge if you want everyday). The hotel is not in a nice area, though being close to the train station was a plus. Other reviews say it is convenient to a lot of tourist attractions, but I would argue that there are other areas that are much more convenient with surrounding neighborhood charm, such as the Coloseum, Pantheon area, or the Spanish Steps. Central Rome has more to offer & I would recommend staying in those areas before here. This is not a Rick Steve's recommended hotel, and of all 6 hotels on our trip this is the only one that wasn't. If you are a Rick Steve's fan, this is not the hotel for you. The streets surrounding the hotel were dirty with dog droppings, the smell of urine, and graffitii on every building, I'd say basically a 5 to 10 block radius. We had to take a cab back after dark, and it took 3 taxi drivers to figure out where the hotel was, and we still had to get out and walk. From what we could tell, this is the only hotel in the area. Again, we may be missing the point with Rome, maybe just finding a clean hotel is tough to do in that city, so this might not be a vaild review. It was certainly clean, however, if we went back, there is no question we would find somewhere else to stay, and most likely pay more to get it instead of staying at this hotel again. Again, maybe we are missing something here, in that we don't know Rome well enough, but personally we have traveled a lot, and our gut tells us this is a 2 star hotel at a good price, but a bad area of town.", "Date": "April 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cNovecento Hotel is Not Just Another Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4976811", "Content": "We stayed at Novecento four nights (April 2006) and had a great time.

It was clean, modern but not huge. Breakfast was continental but tasty. Very central, two stops from termini, a walk to the colloseum and nice churches. We were delighted with it, at \u20ac140 a night it was a steal for Rome!. Compared to some prices I saw on the net. Would definetely go back. ask for Rm 401, as we had our own terraced garden. Friendly staff and the nice weather made all the difference. 4 out of 5.", "Date": "November 1, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cI would stay again\u201d", "Author": "NewYoricanYankee", "ReviewID": "UR4000857", "Content": "Pretty good hotel that was very clean.

On arrival my friend and i found we'd been given a double room instead of a twin. Reception said that we should of asked for two beds at time of booking but in England a twin room is two beds so i presumed it would be the same in Rome. Unfortunately they couldn't change our room so i had to share a bed with my friend! I feel more could have been done to help in this situation. However although the room was small it was very clean and the bathroom immaculate. Breakfast was fine and the roof terrace was nice to take time out and read a magazine. All in all enjoyed the stay and would return although would clarify what room type next time! Rome is lovely by the way if you ignore the graffiti everywhere.", "Date": "October 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cExcellent, friendly hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3749854", "Content": "We went to this hotel based on previous reviews and were not disappointed. It is ideally located about 10 minutes walk to the Colosseum and the Manzoni Metro is practically on the doorstep, which takes you anywhere for 1 euro. There are lots of nice places to eat and there is a great supermarket on the next street. The staff were very friendly and the hotel and room were immaculate. We had a third floor triple room with our own balcony with french doors. Air conditioning was great and very much needed in August. The breakfast was buffet style and plentiful. I would recommend this hotel for first time visitors due to the comfort and security it offers. It wasn't our first trip to Rome, but we will definetly stay here again when we return in the future. Also, we would recommend the San Giovanni market open every day from early till 1pm. It is about 10 minutes walk from the hotel and sells bargain clothes, shoes and jewellery. There are also great little restaurants next to the park in this area. All in all a great stay with absolutely no complaints.", "Date": "August 9, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork Ireland", "Title": "\u201cQuiet and Friendly\u201d", "Author": "corkies", "ReviewID": "UR3535491", "Content": "We've just returned from staying four nights. We chose the Novacento on basis of two reviews on Tripadvisor. The reviews were somewhat over the top but I wouldn't qubble too much. Accommodation, in general, is expensive in Rome and this hotel is on the less expensive side. The hotel is sited on a quiet street about two hundred yards from Metro station, Manzione, that took us quickly to all major attractions in Rome. The staff were friendly and the services very good-air conditioning, shower, bidet, refrigerated bar in room at economical rates. The only drawback was that the double room was on the small side. Breakfast was adequate and could be improved by the provision of more attractive breads and some cold meats. It was lovely to sit out ont the roof garden on balmy nights.", "Date": "June 7, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cPeaceful, newly renovated, modern yet traditionally styled, excellent service\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3370652", "Content": "This is the first review I've ever written, but I thought this hotel was worthy of a good review. In a city of where there is an endless choice of hotels all claiming to be great, this was a an amazing find. Firstly, my priorities in a hotel are cleanliness, service, location and price. Secondary are food, facilities. This hotel gives an immediate feeling that it is run by a nice friendly family willing to do anything to ensure your stay is pleasant. It appears as though the hotel has had a recent to, no expenses spared, makeover. It is really nice inside, yet simple. The rooms have the essentials and are very modern and very clean. Bed, storage, safe, fridge, tv, air con, balcony, toilet, shower. Sound simple, but they have put it together so nicely it welcomes you after a hard day of sightseeing. Rooms I would rate as 4.5 out of 5. Breakfast was always in ample supply. Tea, coffee, juice, toast, many different pastries, cereal, cake, and more. No bacon, eggs, hot food, but these things I would expect as a luxury. It was all enough to start the day with a full stomach. The breakfast area is nicely layed out and intimate. Again it is all very clean and well miantained. (note that only breakfast is served at this hotel). Location is fantastic. Many places claim to be on the main road. But a lot of noise comes with this. This is offf the main road down a small private street which gives privacy. Nice when you want to chill on the hotel roof with a beer. I think the fact it is off the main road makes it cheaper also. The biggest advantage of its location is that it is a 3min walk from a metro stop. And the metro will get you everywhere. The tram is equally close and can take you to the colleseum in 5mins. Or you may choose to go for a pleasant walk. The hotel is only 15mins from the colleseum. Service is fantastic. All speak good english and are willing to go out of their way to ensure your stay is pleasant. Again that family owned feeling is strong. I would rate this hotel on my tough scale as 4.5/5. Perhaps loosing on the fact that I would ideally like a bath, if I was being extremely fussy. It's great for couples or single travellers. The friendly service, modern (yet traditionally styled) interior give an amazing feeling to the place. The location and price make it that much more sweeter.
