I almost cancelled our reservation before travelling last week. I am so glad that I didn't! The Hotel Vondel is a great little boutique hotel and does not deserve such harsh reviews. We are discerning travellers with a keen eye for detail. I had booked an Exec room with a jacuzzi (room 531). The room was on the top floor, which was perfect as we're not keen on having people above us.It was spotlessly cleaned, and thoroughly cleaned every day of our 4 night stay. The bed (two twins together, very typical) was very comfortable and the pillows were perfect, I usually suffer from a stiff neck in hotels but there was no problem here. Room temperature was perfect, but windows opened and there was aircon when needed.After a day of walking, the jacuzzi bath was fantastic and we used it at least once every day. Rain shower was soft, loo was spotless and absolutely did not smell of drains! There's no amazing view from this room, but you can hear the blackbirds and wood pigeons in the morning which was good enough for us. In the main areas, the lobby areas are quirky and comfortable for a pre-dinner drink while you're waiting for your cab. The bar and restaurant are tastefully decorated and again, spotlessly clean. As for the staff, they couldn't be more helpful. They booked cabs for us every night and served drinks (complimentary one if you book on line) with a genuine smile and excellent English. Our only comment was that you sometimes get a faint whiff of cigarette smoke. Not the hotel's fault, they impose fines, but some guests are obviously determined to break the rules. A quick blast of the aircon sorts it out. We didn't breakfast in the hotel, lots of local choice but our recommendations: turn right, then right again for Friday Next - organic eggs, bacon, fresh bread and juice; straight over and over the road for canalside bacon and cheese pancakes; turn right then left and look for the shop selling coffee beans and machines - excellent coffee and fresh muffins further back in the shop. The hotel is in a good area and we walked to all the main \"sights\" from it (comfy shoes and post-walk jacuzzi assisting). There's minor neighbourhood noise at weekends, but it is minor, and good natured. All in all, if you expect perfection you will always find fault (indeed some people seem to delight in doing so) but this is a well-priced, comfortable, clean and friendly hotel in an excellent location.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Glasgow, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cLacking the 'boutique' service.\u201d", "Author": "hybridses", "ReviewID": "UR127830177", "Content": "After searching and planning a first time 3 day trip to Amsterdam with friends, based on location, value and look of Hotel, Hotel Vondel appeared to be the ideal choice. The hotel is located a few tram stops away from Central Station, so you can easily and quickly get to all areas of the city. We used trams and walked to all tourist attractions, restaurants and bars during our trip. When we first got to the hotel it looked stylish and chic, however after sitting in the foyer and bar area it quickly looked a but tired and lacked some TLC! Check in was quick and staff took our bags to a holding cupboard until our room was ready. All staff throughout our stay seemed friendly and helpful, bar one single member of reception staff who couldn't raise a smile nor look you in the eye when talking to you. He came across rude and uninterested. Quite disappointing really since his attitude overshadowed the rest of the staff's efforts. Just smile Maarten. The tired look and feel of the hotel continued into our room which was an exec room on the ground floor. Bad choice! Very noisy with footsteps and people talking from the corridor outside (mainly staff). It was room 130 - already mentioned in another review. The room itself was a lot smaller than expected and certainly smaller than the photo's on the hotels website. The furniture looked old and passed-it and there was little-to-no storage space for clothes. Bathroom was very nice however and bed very comfortable.

The romantic weekend included a welcome drink, an executive suite and a bottle of bubbly. Our first impressions of the hotel were very good. As we were offered to have our welcome drink at the bar, we deciced to have lunch there as wel. In the evening we even decided to eat at the hotel and were not disappointed. The food was very delicious. Overall we were very plesantly surprised how nice this hotel was. The only point of critisism was that the executive suite ( I think it was room no 130) was on the ground floor, in the intersection of a busy corridor, mostly used by the staff, and stairs going upstairs. It was VERY noisy up till around 1 am - 2 am. My husbond went to talk to the reception early during the first evening but according to them they did not have another executive suite available that evening, only the smallest room in the hotel. We did not of course want to change, having paid for an executive one. Next day while being on a canal cruise, the reception called us asking us to come straight away to empty our room so that it could cleaned and we would be given another exec room in the afternoon, we could leave our luggage behind the reception until the other room was ready. As we were on a boat, we could not return straight away and as we only had one night left at the hotel, we decided to keep the noisy room. If we had stayed for a week or so, we would definitely had changed the room, but saw now no reason for the hassle just for one night. So we declined. As we were later returning to the hotel, we found a bottle of red wine and a card from the hotel with their apologies for our inconvenience. We thought this to be a very nice gesture. Expect for the noisy room we cannot fault this hotel. Room and bathroom were clean, breakfast, lunch and dinner were delicious and the interieur is also very pleasant.

The price was right, the location is great, and the hotel does have a good feeling in the common areas. The areas where I did have problems was the following: the reception staff cold & unwelcoming, breakfast expensive for what it was, wifi not free even in common areas (come on people!!), and I had a major problem to get my sheets changed. Finally on day 4 of our stay I had to throw a fit in the lobby with the management asking why do I have the SAME PILLOW CASES after 4 days. I started my complaint the first 3 times with the reception staff who treated me like I was a difficult client and they were rude....then on the 4th day I called in the management into the story. They were very surprised, very helpful, very apologetic, and had the situation resolved immediately. And to go further they offered us dinner in their restaurant, which is quite good, and the staff there very nice!

Our room was small but having booked for a very reasonable price it was acceptable. The room was newly decorated as was the bathroom with beautiful tiles. Although very modern sometimes it seems they lost their focus on functionality. The tap at the sink in the bathroom leaves you little space to wash hands properly which was highly weird. However since we got the room for a good price we checked the guest information. To our astonishment we found the DVD player that you can lend from reception is 10\u00e2\u201a\u00ac plus a mere 200\u00e2\u201a\u00ac deposit. A bike will be 13\u00e2\u201a\u00ac plus a 500\u00e2\u201a\u00ac deposit. Although the daily charges are ok, the deposits are just extortionate! Also one evening we spent in the lounge area. One member of staff was asked about the charges for breakfast. I did not catch the amount but just heard the guest mentioning this is a very high charge to which the member of staff answered \"yes, this is so the owner can buy another car.\" hmmm, nothing the customer needs to know, and seems like there are some problems between management and staff.. The housekeepers have always done a great job and were very respectful of the do not disturb signs.. I have eperienced otherwise before. I found the rooms to be very warm at times and leaving the window open is not ideal as there is a lot of noise coming from the street in the mornings.

The more I looked at this room the more I wanted to kick myself for booking it. The walls were not insulated at all so being that it was around -10degrees outside you could feel a draft when you were near the walls. the lighting wasn't great and there was no cupboard for clothes. The hotel does have a restaurant(we didn't eat there) but it was nice and quiet at night so we slept well. Mornings however was another story, we could hear the buzz of breakfast service and all the guests walking up and down past our door....not a happy bunny. We found that the staff were not very friendly either and when i asked where Albert Cuyp market was the receptionist circled the nine streets???!! They barely cleaned the room and didn't replenish the tea/coffee sachets unless we asked. On the plus side, the location was very good as we were within walking/tram distance of most places, the shower was very very good and there is free internet.

Very close to major museums in a very \"real\" area of Amsterdam. Very close to the Vondelpark - a major running/walking opportunity. Very close to a lot of shopping.

However, I would really advise people to think a million times before booking in this hotel. especially if they use their credit card. I just got back yesterday and it was a terrible experience. I booked 3 rooms with them: 2 refundable and 1 non refundable. They withdrew the entire amount of money for two rooms and blocked 400$ for the third room of my friend's. When my friend found this out, he cancelled his booking, and they told him his money will not be refunded before a month. As for me and my sister, we decided to go ahead and stay there. When we arrived, they said that they will refund us the total amount of money for the 2 rooms, and we pay the full amount when we check out, they didnt of course. I called my bank a day before i checked out, and nothing was refunded. To my bad luck, i was required to stay in Amsterdam for 2 extra nights for business reasons, so Vondel told me that those 2 extra nights will be for 400 Euros for each night, and after a lot of bargaining, yes bargaining! they lowered it to 320 euros and asked that i pay the 640 euros on the spot, which i did. Then when i checked out, they INSISTED that we pay the full amount for the two rooms again! After endless arguments and embarassing scenes at the reception in front of everyone, they gave me the low down and told me i dont have a choice and forcefully withdrew the amount from my credit card as they have all its details! This was one of the worst experiences of my life, and i wish my stay there was worth it, the rooms are tiny and you have to pay a small fortune to get a room that costs half price in any other 3-4 stars hotel. The housekeeping is crap: they rarely change the towels and emptied the trash twice during my 10 days stay. The staff is very inexperienced, they have several interns & those were the best of the whole lot, we had to go and beg the manager a couple of times for someone to change our towels in the bathroom and still they did nothing. The food is average, and they charge you half the price of your meal for bringing the food to your room. The internet is for 10 euros a day, and it operates on 1 device only, so if you are a couple, then you have to pay 20 euros for a daily use of the Wifi. The walls are very thin, there was a room full of kids next to my sister, and she couldnt sleep for 3 nights because of the noise they made.

Stayed 3 nights here. The room seemed okay until we TRIED to get to sleep. Even with ear plugs in we couldn't sleep as our room was below the bar with a fire escpae right ourside/above our window. Every 5 mins poeple were coming out for cigarettes so no sleep and couldn't even have a window open.

When i mentioned the room I was in he smiled to himself and appologiesed and said that we would be moved. So we left our bags in our room and went out, came back at 1pm when we were told our room would be ready but it was not - this was ok as we went out again for the afternoon. We returned at 6pm and the receptionist had NO idea that we were being moved and advised that she couldn't find a room as everyone had checked in so we would have tio stay where we were - then the concierge checked our original room and our luggage had been m,oved - it took the receptionist 30mins to sort this out and she when I explained I was tiered after NOT sleeping the night before - she TOLD me \"well I can't find any information here so just wait ok.\" When we got to our new room I was so tiered I went straight to bed for a few hours. Then went out for dinner and noticed that a bottle of red wine had been put in our room - this was a nice gesture I thought (don't drink red but even so I was impfressed!) THEN.... I noticed the blood on the walls just outside our room! Ah i could go on and on as I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience being there and it just wans't nice. When we checked out we had breakfast on our bill which we had not had and when disputed this was made to feel like we were trying to get out of paying.

She had booked the hotel saying a friend had stayed here and loved it. She and her new husband came with me and my husband for the first part of their honeymoon. When we arrived, the first thing that caught my eye was how filthy and run down the lobby was.I was afraid to sit on the couch. Not what I expected in a four star hotel. The unprofessional woman at the front desk told us we would have to wait while they got the rooms ready, despite this being at almost five pm. When we did go up to the rooms there was a mix-up and my husband and I were placed in the standard room although we had booked the \"Executive Suite.\" I took one look around the tiny room with hideous decorations and said I could not stay. The woman at the desk recognized it was the wrong room category and said they only had one executive suite left and showed us a room below street level. I said that wasn't satisfactory. She said we could complain the next day when a manager would be in. This was on a Monday! After much more back and forth a manager finally showed up and got us into a better, although still ugly, room.How they could call this an executive suite I don't know. There was no free internet and not a real sitting area or desk. On top of this, we had requested flowers and champagne to be placed in our friends room as a honeymoon surprise and this had not happened. After this horrendous beginning, things did improve. The people at the front desk from that point on were friendly and helpful. The sheets and towels were always clean and fresh and the mattress was comfortable. Our room averaged 170 euro's per night. For that they did not provide breakfast. You had to pay an extra 20 euro's for their mediocre buffet. They did give us breakfast for free one day in compensation for the room mess up. You also had to pay extra for in room internet access. Our faucet in the sink only gave out warm water, never cold. The design of the sink was so poor it was ridiculous. To be fair, I think I usually stay in a bit pricier hotels and I always use Trip Advisor. I held some responsibility for this poor choice by letting my young friend decide on the hotel. It was her honeymoon and the sad thing is I cannot imagine a less romantic place to spend it.

The Hotel is located in a very quite residential street a few minutes walk from the town,its very modern and clean and our room was great A tip for you hire a bike to get about we wish this is what we had done as it would of made things a touch easier 13 euros for the day.

Lieplinsen town centre is a busy, bustling,lively up and coming place there's lots of restaurants ,pubs, theatres,cinemas and coffee shops to visit.

The meeting space is accurately photographed on their website, however does not mention the fact that the room is several floors underground, guests literally have to climb down tiny staircases as if entering a bunker. Downstairs in this grim dark room, the tables are in desperate need of repair/ replacement, you could injure yourself on the metal frames that are broken and splintered on several of the tables. It would have helped if they had tablecloths, though they do not and could not manage to arrange any with over half a day's notice. Throughout today if I had not asked for the coffee breaks to be served at least 5 times I doubt that they would have been served at all, still they were late. The lunch was a complete disaster, fish served raw, full of bones accompanied by rock hard risotto, it was only that the entree was such a large serving that the group are not going hungry, the main course and the desert (which was partly still frozen) were both un-edible. There were comments that this was the worst meal ever eaten...or rather not eaten, I am now actually starting to feel sick from the meal (the part of which I could eat). Trying to have documents printed here is also not advisable, the one printer they do have was unable to print 5 pages without jamming and the helpful staff that were on duty last night managed to completely break the printer with the rough manner in which they were trying to get it to work. The bedrooms are good, that is if you are lucky enough to be away from the ground floor where my colleague unfortunately was located and had to leave her tv on overnight in order to drown out the constant noise passing her door.

I tend to like to be slap bang in the middle of everything, so perhaps that's why I was dissatisfied with the walk to the hotel. It's on a charming street, and is contained in several houses. The lobby is quaint but high class. Black marble and furnishings give a very luxurious feel. The front desk staff were polite and checked us in adaquately. The room we booked was a twin. It was on the top floor. Unfortunately because of this, the room was full of ceiling beams and girders so the space was very limited. Putting on one's tshirt was difficult at times. Because of how small the room was, there was no divide between the twin beds, which is always annoying for people who regularly choose such a bed configuration, namely anyone who's not going away with a partner. Consequentially the bathroom was on the small side, with the ceiling beams proving troublesome here also. Also, when coming home late at night (as one is prone to do when staying in the Dam) the front door is locked, so you have to ring the bell and wait to be let in like you've forgotten your keys and have to wake up your Mammy.

The public areas and bar/restaurant are nice, quirky and modern, and we did see the cat reported by a previous reviewer! The cleanliness of the hotel was great, it is well cared for and the staff were very helpful. The receptionist helped us to book a table for dinner in a restaurant in town on Saturday night, which was great, and were very helpful with the room we wanted. When we booked we had asked for an \"L\" room on a high floor because of the previous reviews about street noise in the lower ground floor rooms. I had asked for a bath as well but it turns out the lower ground rooms have baths because they're bigger than the upper floor \"L\" rooms which have a shower instead. Shame, as I really love a bath. We could have upgraded to a better room which do have baths, but they didn't have any the first night and the room they gave us on the top floor was nice enough that I wasn't bothered about moving after that. We did see a lower ground floor room and I would advise asking for a higher floor as the windows in these rooms are at street level and I thought it would be pretty impossible to open the windows without it being noisy - even though the street is very quiet traffic-wise. The room we stayed in was very nice - in the eaves with beams showing and a nice wet room type bathroom. It wasn't exactly enormous but to be honest even though we spent quite a lot of time in it, it was perfectly fine. If you can afford it and you're going to spend a lot of time in the room, I would get one of the rooms with a sofa etc, as that would have been handy. The bed was comfy and large enough for my husband who is over 6ft. No complaints there! Really good transport links to the hotel - about 5 minutes walk to the Leidseplein where you can get one of three trams to the Central station, taking about 10 minutes. Plenty of restaurants etc in the nearby area, and great shopping within walking distance! One thing I would do is avoid the restaurant - it's expensive for what you get and the meal I had there on Sunday was pretty average. The creme brulee was nice, but apart from that I would recommend sticking to the drinks! There are much better and cheaper places for dinner close by.

From youth hostels in France to numerous 5 star hotels in China so I'm well aware that you get what you pay for. However, you should at least get what you pay for! I bought a 4 day stay here through Expedia and the hotel is listed as a 4 star hotel. When I'm paying myself, a 4* is more than enough comfort and service I need at a price that I can afford. How this hotel ever got a 4* rating is beyond me an the hotel and service was comparable with a Travel Lodge - but at least the Travel Lodge has fiendly staff and costs a lot less! When we first arrived our rooms weren't ready so we left our bags and went for a walk to the Leidseplein. We weren't early but they had cleaning staff off sick so we gave them the benefit of the doubt and had lunch. On our arrival back there was a huge queue at the desk with only one woman checking everyone in. Unfortunately she was dealing with a problem with one of the guests rooms and we had to wait 20 minutes to finaly check in. The complaning guest was not happy with their room being under the bar and the noise that came with people wanding around on the wooden floor. They were moved to another room and we were checked in. The room was an ok size and apart from looking a bit shabby very comfortable - until night time. Then as the bar upstairs filled up we realised we were in the room under the bar! Being late we did nothing about it until the morning (we had unpacked already and showered) In the morning I went to reception and it was as if the firl already knew what I wanted to say and was already making preperation for a room change. I also pointed out to her that I had paid extra for a deluxe room and she apologised saying that this had not been noticed at check in and we were shown an enormous room on the first floor of the main building. We moved in to this room and were given free breakfast tokens as way of an apology. (Breakfast is in another building about 5 doors down the road) At breakfast a rogue mouse was running around and causing a great deal of fuss and the staff acted as though this was a normal occurance and barely batted an eyelid. All those at that breakfast were given another free voucher for the next day which I threw in the bin immediately. That night, I could hear a strange scatching noise coming from our bed. I switched the one working lamp on (they never did fix the other lamp even after I asked several times) To our horror there was a mouse on the bed and another climbing up the crtains (which we 2-3 metres high!) I Immediately went downstairs to speak to reception who said they had been having trouble with mice and offered me - you giuessed it - a free breakfast! I told them what they could do with their mouse infested breakfast and asked for a kettle to be brought to my room so I could have a cup of tea and calm down. Unfortunately, they said, the kettle is already in another guests room and they cant wake them up to get it for me. Have you ever heard of a 4 star hotel with one shared kettle for ALL its guest?!?! A mix of this along with what I now understand to be matrimonial beds (2 single begds screwed together - not a real double bed as UK readers will know) we decided to check out and move to the 5* Marriot about 300 metres down the road. I will never get the lost money back from Expedia and wish I had found this site before I left. Given the huge amount of negative reviews for this hotel I could have been forewarned and stayed elsewhere. I'm not overly sensitive, but I was on holiday and payed a decent amount to stay here.

I did not make an advance booking but had checked the website and noticed they had still some free rooms left and I wanted to see the place first before staying there. Uppon arrival I asked for a double room for 1 night which they had available. The receptionist also mentioned to take a look at the neighbouring partner Hotel Roemer. She told us it has even nicer rooms and all rooms where executive style there. On both Hotels we asked if we could see the rooms which was no problem. The standard room in hotel Vondel had no airco but a fan instead and looked a bit small though it was clean and newly decorated. 10 years ago I would not even think of looking at things like an air-conditioning in a hotel in Holland but especially in these old buildings it can be quit hot in the summer so I almost believe Climate Controll is a must have now! The receptionist then showed us the so called executive room (131) on the ground floor which looked very nice! The room was big enough, located on the street side but this was no problem for us because it is a very quiet location. Nicely basic decorated (see photo's), flatscreen TV, new bathroom with jacuzzi and seperate shower and a good working airco. The Executive Room in Roemer also looked very nice and had a jacuzzi, airco, flatscreen TV and a I-POD dock. Because we could get a better price in hotel Vondel for the executive room we decided to take that room instead of the room in the Roemer Hotel. When we wanted to use the jacuzzi in the evening I discovered it was broken and after the technician took a look he said he could not fix it for us this night. Because we only stayed 1 night I went to the reception to check if we could arrange something. The friendly girl immediately gave us a new room which actually was a free upgrade to a suite upstairs (535) (see photos) The suite was great. A very big room with a bigger jacuzzi attached to the bed, a big flatcreen TV on the wall, A seperate very spacious and nice looking shower with 2 seperate Rainshowers and an ceiling airco which was strong enough to cool down the loft style room easily! Like all hotels if breakfast is not included it's a bit expensive (19 euro p.p.) No problem because in the area there are enough places you can eat. Internet (WIFI/LAN cable) is available in the room but was not included in the room price. The price was 10 euro for all day which is not that expensive but still. If I stay longer in a hotel these are things I (and probably many other people) look for and prefer to have included in the room price. But there is 1 laptop in the restaurant though which can be used for free. There was a nice looking garden to have some drinks and snacks or just to relax. We did not have time to spend some time there but it all looked very nice. We really liked the hotel, the style of the rooms, the boutique style decoration downstairs of the bar/lobby/restaurant, and the walking distance to the city centre. Although some of the employees where trainees I believe everybody was very helpfull and friendly to us. Some only speak english but I personally think that is fine in an international city like Amsterdam.

Positives: lobby is pretty cool, great location. We averaged 150 euros per night over 6 nights. Not a massive amount, but enough to expect certain things... Thing 1: The hotel asks for arrival time on their booking page. Okay, we provided it (early one morning). The usual check in time is 3pm. We had expected that we would have to set our bags down and go out for the day. The very rude front desk receptionist (who told us to wait while she finished a conversation in dutch with her friend) told us that the room wasn't ready and wouldn't be so until later that day, but if we would pay 20 euros extra she could guarantee a 2pm check in. 1 hour, 20 euros. hmmmm... This would be interesting, 6 nights to go and already they're hitting us for optional extras. Thing 2: 15 euros extra for plug in internet access... Other hotels usually include this for free and wireless Thing 3: Room... Not the biggest, but not unexpected. Bathroom well appointed, if you exclude towels (only 1), toilet products (no soap or shampoo) and bathmat. Thing 5: Service... TV broke on the 4th night (a friday). We rang front desk and told them. They sent their maintenance man up who couldn't fix it. Eventually, I got it working. Same thing happened later that night. Rang front desk again who said she couldn't do anything about it that evening (maintenance man gone home) but would get someone onto it the next morning. I told them that it had to be fixed the next night as we were having an early night and would be watching some tv. otherwise they would have to change the room. Ok she said. Saturday night: TV not fixed and suddenly no idea about problem. SAME GIRL! early flight on the monday, so told her again to fix the problem or we would be demanding a room change or our money back for the last two nights. Yes sir, will be fixed sir. No better sunday night. She (same girl) told us that she would have management call us the next day to arrange some compensation. No call, no calls returned and no further correspondence.

We parked our automobile in the Byzantium parking garage that is close by the hotel (2 minute walk). The garage is expensive (4 euros per hour) however, it is very secure allowing those that only have a parking ticket to enter the garage area. We walked around the city for the rest of our stay. Neighborhood The hotel is located on Vondelstraat just south of Leidesplein. It is a very good location as it is close to Museumplein and within walking distance to the centrum to the other attractions. Vondelstraat is a quiet street which made it ideal so that you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have any noise from the busy city. Tram #1 is close by if you need to go farther places in the city. The area around the hotel is safe and is close to the higher end shopping streets (Van Baerlestraat and Pieter Cornelisz (P.C.) Hooftstraat). Although the hotel is just outside the center it is within walking distance and provides a peaceful stay. Room (photos included) We had a Two Person Room (Tweepersoons Kamer \u00e2\u20ac\u201c room 435) and our rate was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 as an average per night for the weekend (not including breakfast). We booked the hotel through the hotel website. The room was a good size and had a neutral modern d\u00c3\u00a9cor (room was carpeted). The bed is actually two twin beds together and very comfortable. The room had a sofa but could serve as a third bed. It also had two chairs and a wardrobe that had a safe and mini bar fridge inside. Bathroom (photos included) The bathroom was very spacious. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor was in a dark stone color. Our bathroom had a shower/tub combination with a rain showerhead. The toiletries were the Rituals brand \u00e2\u20ac\u201c smelled very nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shampoo, shower gel and bar soap. The bathroom included a hair dryer as well. The bathroom was very clean. Amenities/Service We did have drinks in the bar area one night. The bar area is decorated nicely and we found the bar food not so good \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the offerings were mainly fried food. The hotel staff was very nice and courteous.

There are a few things that were unpolished about the hotel \u00e2\u20ac\u201c tile grout was damaged around many tiles on the floor in the common area, bartender insulted the guests at the bar (maybe the bartender was trying to be funny but it was annoying as she spoke very loudly to the other guests in the bar while we were trying to enjoy our drinks), the bathroom faucets were really low so that you have barely enough room for your hands to fit and the manager of the hotel yelled at one of the maids in front of us in the elevator (he heard us speaking English in the elevator and spoke nastily to the maid in Dutch not releasing that we spoke Dutch as well).

My luggage was moved by the hotel staff and when I came back it was a little suprise when I entered the room: I think I was upgraded to a bigger room, ground floor, facing garden again and with a jacuzzi! I stayed only for 2 nights, but wish I could have stayed longer. As a female traveller I felt very comfertable in this room. The receptionist where friendly and the hotel was nice decorated.

Admittedly, I had high expectations based reviews, the website and the nightly rate, however this place is terrible. Whilst there are some nice design elements and friendly staff, the managements' attitudes and policies are unacceptable. We moved rooms 3 times during our stay. The first room we were given was a basement room which was dark, noisy and has incredibly low ceilings. The deal-breaker, however, was the gas from the sewage system bubbling up through the toilet and sink. After much confusion we were moved on the second day to a room at the front of the building where the building works were going on. They are renovating the facade so have scaffolding erected blocking your entire view. This room was like living on a construction site - and we were paying for it! It was noisy from 8am, it was dusty and dirty and there was no privacy. Management had kindly written a note apologising for the inconvenience and advising us to close the windows completely when leaving the room as the hotel would not take any responsibility for lost or stolen items. Unbelievably, while we were out the painters were given full access to our room to paint the windows! We returned in the afternoon to find our belongings moved, the curtains tied up and the windows all wide open to dry. When I approached the Hotel Manager to discuss this, he seemed to think this was normal practice and said that we could not expect the hotel to stay half empty while they were doing the works. It is our understanding that your hotel room is for your sole use for the period you occupy it, however this hotel believes otherwise. There was no apology, however we were moved to a third room at the back of the building. In addition to our grievances with the accommodation, other areas that management need to address are the inflated rates for bike hire and the excessively high internet rates. We have grown accustomed to being provided with free WiFi in hotel rooms and it is a shock to be charged 22 euro a day for the service.

I found this hotel on booking.com and booked it because it was a very good price (190 euros for 2 nights) for a hotel in the centre of Amsterdam. The receptinist was quite nice and gave me a room on the third floor. When I saw it, I was shocked! The room (with bathroom) was maybe 8 square metres (80-85 square foot) in size. Before I came to Amsterdam, I was in Brussels (NH Atlanta hotel, 2 nights-150 euros, breakfest included, unlike in Vondel hotel) where the bathroom was nearly that size. Moreover it had one bed on top of the other (I've never seen this in any hotel) like in a hostel. There was no safe in the room so I asked for another one. I moved to a room on the fourth (top) floor which was slightly bigger, but still wery small. In my country (Croatia) which compared to Holland isn't very developed there are standards that hotels have to meet in order to get a rating. One of those for instance is that if you want to have four stars on your hotel, all rooms have to be of certain size(20 square metres i think). The entire floor used to be an attic and in the hallway that led to the room there was a \"mind your head\" sign. I hawe no idea how they got a permission to put rooms there. All hallways are very narrow and look claustrophobic. Another bad thing was the sound insulation ore the lack of it. You can hear the TV or people talking in rooms nextdoor, you can hear every step they make. Another thing I noted that someones food was on the floor in the hallway for the entire period of my stay there.

We duly went to the Vondel and were shown to a building separate from the main hotel which was undergoing renovations. The builders were working as we walked in and there was no lift in operation. We were shown to our rooms. The triple was very small and the twin was a little bigger. We weren't very happy because we had not been told that there were renovations going on and had we known at the time of booking we probably would have gone elsewhere!

As it turned out we were not charged for breakfast and this was automatically deducted from our bill on checkout without any fuss. While I compliment Nina on her professional way of dealing with our complaint, it was a bit of a pain in the neck!

I thought that Le Garage was really great - the food was excellent and it had a great buzz mainly due to the interesting clientele and the good company I was in!!", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "laneyboo", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Luxury\u201d", "Author": "laneyboo", "ReviewID": "UR10382786", "Content": "We are just home today from Amsterdam and i'm writing the review already which should tell you something!

The entrance and lounge of the hotel is stunning aswell.

First impressions of the reception and bar area were very pleasant and lived up to the 'boutique' image. I stayed in the 'seperate annex' on the 4th floor but it is not a problem not being in the main part of the building. The only negative I would comment on was the lift in this building was out of order and the stairs are very steep - but a porter carreid our cases up to the room so it was not a nig problem. I was in a twin executive which I did not find at all small, and the bathroom was very spacious compared to some hotels I've stayed in. Others in my party had a tripple executive and that was very large. The rooms were clean so no negatives there! We found the staff to be very helpful and friendly - they made restaurant bookings for us, organised taxis and helped with our luggage.

The rooms are quite spacious althought not super lux -- the only main problem was the first night they had us in a first floor room, which is right on the street - about 7am, every person coming or going who was dragging a suitcase across the cobblesone walk (think clackety clack) made it an earlier awakening than I had hoped for (we were on vacation mode) We asked to be moved the next night, and they put us on the 3rd floor which was much quieter. As another reviewer mentioned, we were in a separate building about two doors down from the main lobby, however this didn't really bother us at all. We enjoyed the computer access they offered in the bar lobby area, and the bar was a nice place to have a drink. They also seemed to have a really nice garden area out back however it was too cool during our visit to really use it. This hotel is very close to a high end shopping street.

This meant taking your luggage through a number of doors, into a SUPER small lift (only can fit in 2 people and 1 luggage a piece). Also, as we found out later through our other friends who had stayed in the main hotel, there was no air-conditioning at all in any of the rooms. We found this to be quite annoying as even though the weather was overcast, the rooms were still fairly humid to sleep in. Also, there were no ventilation in the hallways which meant you can smell smoke throughout the rooms and hallways. Another problem we found was the noise level.

If I am honest there were good and bad points, but more bad than good and we have definately have had a lot better for our money. We booked direct with the hotel, for 4 adults, we requested 2 executive double rooms. When we arrived they only had allocated one room, luckily I had the email confirmation for two rooms, so eventually they managed to source a second room, after much panicking on the hotels behalf and much apologising. We were shown to our rooms which was away from the main hotel and down the street, which I personally did not like, it just didnt feel like you were staying in a hotel, just that you had paid for a room, in a hostel type building for the night. Our rooms we were not impressed with, they were 2 floors away from one another, and I couldnt believe that these were executive rooms, they were small, overcrowded, and overlooked a area where there was building work going on, there was builders in the hallway, with drills and hammers and I was informed later by the hotel manager that there had been a flood previously which of course they have no power over. We spoke to reception and advised that we were not happy, she said that the manager would come over and see us if we waited in the bar. Whilst in the bar we ordered drinks. 1 barcadi and coke, 1 vodka and coke, and 2 lagers and 1 coffee, it cost just short of 30 pounds, so be warned. Whilst in the bar, we chatted to a American who has a basement room, in the same building as ours and who was also not happy and waiting for his room to be changed. The manger saw us, and seemed fed up,I think it is a real problem with people changing rooms at this hotel. Having said that the new rooms which we were allocated were within the main building and were almost twice the original size, and also had a balcony - so much nicer, but just what you would expect anyway in a hotel of this standing. Reception staff that dealt with us were lovely, but the hotel itself we did not like - there was no warmth to it, it did not have a warm and welcoming atmosphere, is very oppresive in its decor as mentioned previously, decor looks nice in the photos but up close, its very cheap looking, like someone has gone in and done a 24 hour makeover, it all looks like its been done up on a really cheap budget, apart from the ensuites that is, which look like money has been spent on them.

I arrived at the Vondel about 10.30pm and checked in. Reception was next to the bar area and there was a lively discusussion going on about football but it was clearly one of the staff who was \"effing off\" three times in just five minutes. The first room I was shown too, was on the first floor, up steep stairs in an adjacent building. Stopping at the door, a mouse was struggling to gain entry, underneath! I didn't want the room so asked to, and exchanged for another. This was the style; black carpet, black curtains, a black painted wardrobe. Must have been an undergrad art design student in charge. On a first feebie job. Totally oppressive interior. The room was tiny - all furniture squeezed in so tightly that there was only just enough space to navigate around the bed. On the bed itself - four pillows, two cushions. None provided for a comfortable sleeping position either individually or as part of the set. At the base of the bed, was a furniture console/writing desk. Now, I like my feet to hang over the base so this proved to be totally impossible. So now, I have nowhere to put my feet or rest my head! I'm in a sprawl across the bed's only redeeming feature - a comfortable mattress. However, the wall mounted tv is only little more than a metre from my face and I'm hit by the vivid green brightness of the LCD display which includes the clock. I'm not going to switch it off as I am one of those people who needs to be able to see the time in the dark. So now I can't sleep on my favoured left side either. In this oppressive green tinged blackness there is additionally a constant low level electric refrigerator hum. Just as I think I'm about to get some sleep - someone enters the room above. Bang. Bang. Bang. Every footstep magnifies in my room. So too every floorboard creak. The toilet cistern flush may just as well have been my own. Then the mobile phone goes off and there's inane chat on and off over the next ninety minutes until just after two. I hear everything. EVERY LAST WORD! This is supposedly a \"boutique\" hotel (hah!) so why no sound deadening insulation between rooms? I do not sleep the whole of the night. In the morning, I'm seated on the loo - there's a single strand of long balck hair tapered down the tiling (not mine!). How could anyone cleaning the bathroom have missed it?

The Hotel Vondel is definitely the best hotel I've stayed in Amsterdam, especially for the price. I trawled the different booking websites and found the best prices on octopus travel.com - the price included tax & breakfast which many other websites excluded. After reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, I opted for an up-grade to an executive room. However, be warned, Octopus quoted me an extra \u00c2\u00a330 per night to book this. I decided to contact Vondel hotel direct after the initial booking for the standard room had been made through Octopus and they quoted an extra 20 Euros payable upon check-out, which worked out a lot cheaper. After the first night in our room situated in the adjacent building, we requested to be moved due to the noise from the lift. The staff were helpful, and by the time we had returned that day, our bags had been moved to a room in the main building. The rooms are clean, modern and welcoming and the executive rooms are more than spacious.

Reception check-in was a bit slow but we got sorted and were shown to our room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 405 which is in the attic of the hotel and had one sloping ceiling. I think it has to be the smallest room in the hotel and I was gutted as I really wanted a nice room. I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expecting anything massive but a bit bigger would have been preferred. I went back to reception looking for a new room and was told there was nothing else available in the new hotel but tomorrow they could move us. So we had to sit it out. The bathroom was so small we had to leave the door open. There was a tiny bit of room to walk around the bed but it was tight! Only one mirror in the tiny bathroom and to top it off, our \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcdouble room\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 was in fact 2 singles (which we are used in Europe) but these were literally 2 singles side by side and 2 tiny duvet covers that barely covered us. So a bit disappointing but still very clean, cozy and modern. The next day we got upgraded to a fabulous 2 bed apt with fully equipped kitchen and fabulous sitting room area. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s just a pity that we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have this luxury for both nights or even a bigger bedroom to begin with.

The hotel is in a good location, a quiet street just off one of the main sqaurea and 2 min walk to a tram stop which will take you anywhere in Amsterdam. The rooms are also nice but not ideal if you don't want to have to leave the main building and go up the street to get to your room. The first night we stayed in a room overlooking the street. The room was nice and had a balcaony however come 7 am there was noise in the street and this woke us up so we asked to move to a room at the back.

It is modern and different but not for those whoo are looking for a traditional luxury hotel.", "Date": "February 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hampshire UK", "Title": "\u201c4 Stars your having a laugh!!\u201d", "Author": "Steveracer", "ReviewID": "UR4471081", "Content": "Hotel Vondel, 4 Star\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s you got to be having a laugh. Bad Experience for us I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m afraid.Having searched through tons of hotels on the net we plumped for this one. From the majority of trip reports it looked good. The fact that it was also advertised as 4 Star Hotel made our minds up. On the website \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcEasy to Book\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, it clearly states and I quote \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hotel Vondel has 67 Modern (?) comfortable and attractively decorated rooms\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it goes on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Characterized by its unique interior design.All rooms provide outstanding comfort and convenience for both business and leisure traveller\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. This could not be further from the truth with what we experienced. On arriving at 14.45hrs our room was not ready. Not to worry we booked in and went for something to eat. Around 16.00hrs we returned. The staff were friendly and gave us the pass to the room. Up we went to the top floor. When the lift door opened it seemed that we were in the attic, we were met with building works going on. The main carpet was covered with another covering to protect it but this had crumpled up causing tripping hazards all along the entire length of the floor. A short turn left and we found our room, 404. Not sure what the other rooms are like but beware this room is dreadful. Remember the quote about attractively decorated rooms, outstanding comfort and unique interior design. Maybe our expectations are too much for a supposedly 4 Star hotel. The room was seriously small. With hardly any room to swing a cat, or put your suitcase. The decor was truly awful, dull and dreary like something from the 1950\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. One very small window let in the light but on looking out of it you looked straight into the skylight on the roof of the house next door. Another long thin window behind the TV that was on the wall had dark curtains drawn and was very awkward to get at, to even open the curtains let alone look out of it. The room had No Heating yet in the text it quotes about Comfort. The head board had these strange rings coming out of it, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhats that all about!\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 the mind boggles. We sat and chatted about the fact we were not happy with what we had found. In the end we decided that enough was enough already. The fact that major building maintenance was taking place outside our room, told us the floor should not be in use, the room itself was No way near Comfortable as stated. And this really put us off of the rest of the hotel. We went off and looked into another hotel. With room's available we went back to the Vondel and checked out. The staff member asked us to reconsider and to look at 1 more room they had available. This room turned out to be a flat next door to the Hotel and right at the top of the building. The place had no lift and my wife had to use her inhaler on reaching the top. This room/flat although being much bigger was still not suitable due to the stairs leading up to it. On returning to the Vondel we found ourselves offered another room, by another member of staff who seemed to take over from the guy who was dealing with us, yet we had been told previously there was only 1 more room available. At this point we again stressed that we wanted to go. Then the fun and games started. The new member of staff then said we would have to pay full price despite only being there just over 2 hours. I queried this by asking are you seriously going to charge us full price for a sub standard attic type room on a floor level that clearly should not be in use. Now, we expected to pay something but not full price! I said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sorry I cannot understand that, the hotel is clearly not as stated. Showing and quoting from the paperwork I had taken from the website advertisement. Again I was told we would have to pay full price. Fine I said but when I get back Tripadvisor will get a full report. And that may affect future clients for the Hotel. I said that I would also inform the Dutch Tourist Board of the situation and could they give me the address. The next bit amazed us. The hotel staff member told us that they did not have the address for the Dutch Tourist Board and they did not know it!! On saying that he then gave us our check out papers and said I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve checked you out. I offered the money and he declined!! Saying I have checked you out I hope your next Hotel is better than this one, what he did not know was we had been to the 5 Star Marriot on the corner and booked in there, cost us a lot more but boy was it worth it for some comfort. Why when we offered the money did they suddenly refuse, was it something to do with us mentioning The Dutch Tourist Board!! we will never know.

So we went in and they did give us a great rate since we were last minute and even threw in free breakfast. however, even at a deeply discounted rate it was not worth staying here. the rooms are built beneath street level, which make them quite noisy as you can hear people walking on the street and then people above you, since the lobby and the bar of the hotel are upstairs. The first room they gave us, when we walked in the carpet was flooded, since it had been raining all day. We asked for another room, which was dry although the carpet in the hallway outside was quite wet. We went to dinner and when we came back there was a very loud whirring noise reverberating throughout our room. When we checked with the staff they didn't seem to know anything about the noise, so we had them come to our room and listen. After some discussion they admitted that they had turned on a pump to keep the water out of the hotel. We asked to change rooms again. They then moved us next door to their apartments. The apartments were in bad shape and in need of updating. They just weren't very nice. While the staff were accommodating about moving us, i felt that we shouldn't have had to move three times in the first place. It seems like there are nicer places to stay in Amsterdam and so i wouldn't waste your time with the Hotel Vondel.
