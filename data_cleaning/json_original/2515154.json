The \"hits\" are all outlined by previous reviewers- and I concur with them all. But I considered the room to be nothing more than a Best Western type with fancier beds and better towels. Did like the balconey tho. Too bad about the stereo \"sucker trucks\" working on the storm drains, one at the bottom of the hill and one at the top. Incredibly noisy machines, but obviously not the hotel's fault. The breakfast, however, was their fault. The \"hot breakfast\", as was advertised, did not include potatoes or any kind of meats- staples in most people's hot breakfasts. And putting a few sprigs of rosemary in the instant eggs doesn't hide the fact that they are instant eggs. My final comment, perhaps, sums up my mixed feeling best: When we returned home there was a message from the hotel. The cleaning staff had found \"a multi-coloured belt\" in our room and they'd be happy to ship it back to us. Hmm. Very nice. One problem- it wasn't our belt. Wonder how long it went unnoticed... There are \"misses\" tho. Twice I called down to the desk and asked for help and both times nobody showed. And both times when I called back a 2nd time to let them know I`d solved the issue myself, I was told that the person I`d been waiting for \"was sitting right beside (me)\" at the desk- as apposed to being en route to our room to fix the problem.

There is a working fireplace, armchairs, sink and fridge. The bathroom was huge. The bed is clearly quite new and firm. Most people would find this comfortable but I am used to sleeping on memory foam, so I found it a little too firm. A morning breakfast buffet is included in the price. This is high quality food with a lot of choices. Everything is made fresh including the muffins and quiche. There were 5 kinds of juice, 2 hot dishes, hot cereal, cold cereal, choices of bread, fruit and even soy milk. Many hotels advertise an included breakfast but this one rates 5 stars! There is also \"afternoon tea\" from 4 p.m. to 6:30. This is also extensive and includes red and white wine, coffee, teas, cheese, crackers, crudites with dip, fruit, and a fresh baked dessert. I didn't bother going out for dinner after this. On the downside, Room 12 has no telephone. I don't carry a cell due to roaming charges, so I had to go to the front desk to use a phone. However, there was a desktop available in the lobby. I was told the wiring in Room has to be re-done. There is no way to contact the desk once you are in this room if you don't carry a cell. The morning and early afternoon staff are very helpful and friendly. However, the young lady who works afternoons needs communication training. Her presentation of information is fast and disorganized. It is better to speak with the earlier shift. The location of this hotel is excellent. The Seattle Art Museum is across the street, Pike Place Market is a very short walk, and downtown shopping is also 6 blocks away. A large number of restaurants and bistros are close by. There is no need for a car. In fact, I was told that parking is $25 per day. When I stayed there was a 2 nights for 1 deal offered from Sunday to Thursday. Considering the meals and the location of this hotel, I felt it was a real deal. The regular price for my room would be outside my budget. I would stay here again if I could get the 2 for 1 deal and overall, I recommend this hotel.

The property is part of an apartment tower. There are 30 guest rooms. We arrived after a morning flight, knowing check-in time was 3 PM but hoping for the best. We got in around noon. The reception was cool, to say the least. We were permitted to drop off our suitcases, and they took my number to call us when the room was ready. We had lunch, wandered around, got really tired, hung out in a pub, and came back to the inn at around 2:30. We were told our room had just become available. I wasn't born yesterday - it just wasn't a priority. The front desk people were consistently diffident. I went there one time to ask a question, but three of them were talking animatedly about something and didn't even look up. The staff at the adjacent desk, supporting the apartment building, were consistently friendly and helpful, even though we were not their clients. Our suite was nice - comfy king size bed, huge bathroom, low def TV, work desk, wet bar and fridge in the sitting room. There were two simple problems with the room. Despite the very nice furnishings, we found it hard to read in the room because the lights were too dim. And the bathroom had cheap single-ply Costco toilet paper. There is no wi-fi in the room, but there was an ethernet jack. I couldn't use it - my MacBook Air doesn't have ethernet - but neither could anyone else, because the port was 10 feet away and at a right angle from the desk.

So when we arrived and I saw it is part of an apartment building I cringed. Then when we finally got past the locked front door and the apartment lobby staff was so much more friendly than the hotel's staff, I began to get frustrated. This was a birthday trip for my husband, and I chose this hotel so I didn't want to disappoint him on a special weekend. We got a blur of information including parking instructions-you have to drive down two blocks, circle down behind the apartments and park in a public lot. The desk clerk did not say it was a public lot, so that was fun to figure out. In a relatively short amount of time we make it back up to the hotel and were shown to our room. The fireplace is really nice to have in your room. And their robes are wonderful. But, for now, that is where the nice ends. The bed was so hard and my pillow was so flat I woke the next day with a sore back and neck. That hasn't ever happened to me in a hotel before. Our towels smelled so strong of some chemical, I couldn't stand to use them. Rust stains around the toilet were unappealing. And I had to run the water for several minutes before I had hot water for a shower. ? How does that happen in a hotel like this??? French doors were opened immediately because the room smelled-we kept them open as much as possible. I can't place what it was, it just didn't smell good. When we opened the french doors, we noticed the white blinds were dirty, too. The lamp had a burn spot on the shade and the bedside table's laminate top was peeling. So cleanliness was poor, service was very poor, and initial presentation (including dirty elevator floors, maintenance carts parked in the lobby all day, and a locked front door you have to get buzzed into) was very poor. The next morning I hoped the next shift of staff would be better. But not really. We asked at the front desk for information on public transit to the football stadium for a game we were going to later in the afternoon. The clerk pointed us to a train tunnel two blocks up, so that was helpful. But it would have been really nice if she had also told us the buses in the tunnel run the same course and they are free. A great piece of information for downtown guests to have... Upside: staying in a hotel right by the market and the waterfront was so much fun. We saw a part of downtown Seattle we have never explored on foot, and we have been going to Seattle for a lot of years. I know there are a lot of hotels downtown to choose from, so if you are debating if it is worth it to stay downtown, it is so worth it to stay there! No hassle with finding parking downtown, come back to the hotel if you want a break, public transit is so close and takes you all over if you don't want to drive, and more to see and do around every corner than you could ever do. Really, really nice to be down in the heart of things. The breakfast and the afternoon cocktail hour are good. The food service area looks very clean and well presented. But that is not enough to make us go back to the Inn at Harbor Steps. And I would not search out a Four Sisters Inn since this one was so poor. I submitted a survey to the hotel and I will say the same thing here: this was like a hotel which wants to be upscale but just isn't willing to really put in the level of effort it takes.

No windows other than a French door that opened onto a fake balcony that faced a populated alleyway that was noisy at times and offered little privacy. We wanted the door open just for air (the room was very stuffy), but originally noise prevented us from doing that, and then the door actually came off its hinges and was not safe to open. We happened to be here on a hot weekend (rare, I realize), and the air conditioner in the room was our next resort, but it was not working well and was noisy going on and off at unplanned times (??) so we had to turn that off overnight. -Insufficient artificial lighting (small lamps in a dark and large room). -Free wifi is NOT available in your room unless you tap into the network from Tully's, a nearby coffee shop. The free wifi advertised by the hotel is only available in the common areas of the hotel and requires an access code that changes every time you log on.

But, for what we paid, I would have rather spent $50 more and stayed down the street at Hotel 1000 in one of their Executive Rooms. We found it strange that a boutique hotel wouldn't have wine glasses in the room - and when we called to request them, we were told we could retrieve them ourselves from the breakfast room. The breakfast room reminded my of the common area in a Holiday Inn Express or something of that caliber. Other reviewers are correct in that parking is difficult to navigate - you want directions. You not only get physical keys, but also 2 fobs for the garage and buidling access - it's quite a handful. Do ask for a quiet room - there are a couple that appear to be right under the viaduct exit.

I had read in previous reviews that noise can be a problem so I called and asked for a really quiet room. Now that I've been there, I don't know how noise could be an issue - the rooms are HUGE and while we were there we didn't hear a peep from anyone else. The front desk told us the hotel was sold-out, but we sure couldn't tell. There is an afternoon wine and cheese time at 4:00. It was a nice little snack - white or red wine, veggies and dip, crackers and cheese and a coconut cake. It went pretty quickly, so if you're going to do it, you should probably be there right at 4:00. There is a breakfast buffet in the morning with egg dishes, a type of potato casserole, fresh fruit, homemade muffins, fresh juices, Irish oatmeal, and tea and coffee. For $5 a person you can have breakfast delivered to your room - that's what we did, and it was well worth it. The bedding is really nice - down comforters and really comfy pillows. The furniture was very comfy - two wing back chairs, and a desk chair plus a really comfy bed. The room was absolutely huge. We had a microwave and a little fridge and lots of counter top space. The bathroom was really lovely - the bath products smelled wonderful and the towels were thick and comfy. One of the nicest things about the room was all the windows - there was a lot of natural light. We had a french door onto a little balcony that looked out onto the lovely garden area.

Here are pros and cons: CONS: Check in desk staff sit at low chairs so that you can't see them as you enter the lobby. They don't wear nametags and the blonde who happened to work the Saturday we checked in was what could only be described as \"snippy\". Perhaps she didn't want to be identified? We seemed to disturb her by asking simple questions such as how to handle the complicated parking situation and when we came back at 2pm to see if the room was ready, were told rather curtly it would be ready at 3PM, no sooner. The room itself was laid out rather oddly. There was an older TV and no DVD player as advertised online. The fireplace was in the hallway. The bathroom lighting was dim. Towels and bathrobes were frayed. The bed was somewhat lumpy and the only pillows provided were small and flat. PROS: Afternoon tea was adequate. The red and white wine in decanters was not very good quality. Cheese was ho-hum generic Costco quality. The morning breakfast was definitely better. Quiche, fruits, cereals and good muffins.

'The Harbor Steps' should not be confused with the Spanish Steps! It is not a pleasant area nor is it quiet and the nearby viaduct traffic is not quiet either.

The bathroom had globs of stuff on the walls and grout in the shower was missing or dirty. The mat in the bath was dirty. There were layers of dust along the edges of the carpet near the bed and cobwebs in the corners. The decor was drab and uncoordinated. Heating and cooling systems are a joke, see photos. The TV was circa 1980s and placed in a location that made it difficult to watch from anywhere in the room. There was no information about local TV channels so if you are there during a weather event, you are on your own. The local magazines and Where mag were months and years out of date.

They pretty much all follow the same formula: quaint accommodations (no longer with teddy bears!), afternoon reception, \"signature\" breakfast, and helpful staff. While we certainly had enough to eat, it wasn't food that is responsible for my low rating. We arrived August 29, 2011, after a week's cruise to Alaska and wanted to spend four more nights in Seattle. The proximity to Pike Place Market and the Seattle Art Museum was the deal maker. We checked in around 1 PM and were told to wait until 3:00 PM, the official time of check-in, but that we could leave our cellphone number to be paged when room was ready. No greeting or welcome. We decided to wait in the lobby tht both the inn and the apartment complex share, with the Sunday Times spread out on the sofa. At a little after two, my wife left to use the facilities, which, we were told, were downstairs where the rooms are also located. On the way back, she happened to pass by room #19, the room assigned to us, and noticed a Do Not Disturb sign posted. There was no cleaning staff anywhere in evidence. I relayed this information to the same receptionist. The same cool treatment continued. She would \"look into it.\" Shortly before three and after abandoning her post at the desk, another employee gave us the keys to another room, one that had been ready all along. No one had bothered to check on our original room assignment. Inside the cavernous room, we found very old furnishings. I had no idea how old they were until trying to sleep on the low, saggy, lumpy bed. The miracle was that neither one of us had any repercussions--no sore back. We managed to sleep fine. The following evening our TV was set to only seven basic channels. Another clerk discovered that \"a previous guest must have tampered with the set.\" When my wife also mentioned the poor bed and tired furnishings, she replied that rooms would be renovated. (Why rent any room that is sub-standard?) But my greatest disappointment came from the many times we sought information or had concerns (i.e. the TV problem). There was simply no one at the desk for ten minutes at a time. Although most of the staff seemed pleasant enough, there was no sign of professionalism. During the afternoon wine and hors d'oeuvres reception, there was no host/hostess to oversee the operation. One just came in and dealt with whatever was left. At $250 a night--no senior discount here--we feel that better standards should be apparent. Perhaps one day that might happen. But until then, we cannot recommend the inn and hope that the Four Sisters management takes a long look at their operations. I should point out that bus transportation is free in zone 1 (right downtown). On one day we took the bus (#22) to Broad Street, walked to the Olympic Sculpture Park, walkrd to the Space Needle, took the Monorail one way to the end of the line, walked back to our inn for only $1.00, the price of the senior ticket to the Monorail. We splurged at the Giorgian in the Fairmont Hotel, three blocks up. Superb service and excellent $49 prix-fixe menu, which included their legendary black and white souffle. We also pulled our suitcases (one each) to the Fairmont to take the Gray Line Express airport shuttle for $15. By all means visit Seattle.

The bed was average, but fine for us. Floor A room 8 Let me explain how this place is situated. This is an apartment bldg and they rent out the lower floors that are below the main level. The room are not underground as they sit along a fairly steep incline so the are along the area OFF of the Harbor Steps which are a main pedestrian way to the water 2 bolcks away. It is very quiet at night as this area outside the rooms is closed at night. There is a very nice breakfast served every day. From different egg dishes, potatoes, cereal, fresh fruit, muffins, coffee and oj. etc Changes a little daily. Allen is the cook and does a great job! From 4:30 til 6:30 they put out wine and cheese and some veggies and some kind of cake to munch on in the Library area. Very Nice. There is a small gym, basketball court, lap pool, hot tub and laundry use.. If you want to save some $$$ take the Light Rail from the airport to the University stop and walk ONE block down to !st st and the Inn is right there on the left. $2.50 per person, Yes only two and a half bucks. About $40 bucks for a taxi. Just follow the sign at the airport for the Light Rail, it's about a 5-10 minute walk and its lighted and marked well. It takes 35 minutes to get there. If you need anything there is a small market halfway down the Harbor Steps. I didn't find it till we were leaving though. Lots of places to eat in the area within walking distance. Only about a block from the waterfront, which you can take the elevator down to 1 and avoid the steps if you like. The elevator is kind of across the walkway, just ask the guys at the front desk. It's floor 6 on the way back, which is strange cause it's the ground level.

Whewn we came back two weeks later, the baggage, we had left here, was already brought to our room...( never experienced anything like that before!) The breakfast really has a nice toich, not the \"anywhere the same\" breakfast., although my husband missed some ham or meaty stuff... the location is absolutely perfect, just minutes from that wonderful market, across the street from the Art Gallery... , the Aquarium, shops, Pioneet Sqaure... A nice touch is also the free lemonade on the reception counter and the cookies. Not bad, when you come from an intercontinetnal flight, I am always drained out and a welcoming sip of refreshment is a nice touch!. What I also did like was a small questionaire, where we were asked forn outstanding servise experienced at other hotels.... I daresay that few other hotels of this kind and price range offer better service..!!!

Our room was complete with a fireplace, evening chocolates, robes, coffee/tea maker, and a frig that had complimentary bottled water. It's more personable like a B&B, with the looks of a hotel. The breakfast was served in a dining room for guests only and we were surprised at the variety and freshness of it all.....fresh fruit, juices, egg dishes, breads, pastries, oatmeal, dry cereals, yogurt........we wanted for nothing. There were 16 in our group and everyone loved it. One of our friends booked the gym for two hours one evening to play some basketball, while others had free access to the pool, hot tub, and exercise rooms. There was cool, orange water as we arrived and freshly made cookies. The beds were comfortable and I think the entire group slept well, despite some noise issues with some of the a/c. The monorail was located a short walk toward city center which took us to the Space needle within minutes. Next door to the Inn was a Brazilian Restaurant that we were dying to try after we reviewed the menu, but we just ran out of time. We did have time though for the coffee shop two doors away with the most amazing strawberry scones!! The easterners that we were, we'd be up very early and go walking before breakfast and this coffee place held us over until the real breakfast! The restaurants are so close. Several of our group tried the Crab Pot on the water and loved it, as did the rest of us who chose to try the different chowders at various places...Seared scallop chowder, clam chowder, corn chowder.....every one was better than the rest. Every Friday, the large steps 'Harbor Steps\", adjacent to the hotel that descends to the pier, hosts a musical group and that was a nice place to sit and relax after all the walking. Can't forget to mention the place on 1st street just south of the Pike's Market........the window is a showplace for the hundreds of chocolate and caramel covered apples. At $8.00, you may think it's a bit pricey, but we shared a rocky road concoction (easy to do because they cut it all up for you!) that was heavenly.

Check-in: A little disconcerting. There is no clear sign of the Inn, just of Harbor Steps apartments. We called the hotel and the front desk guy said they were the same thing, and proceeded to rapid-fire instructions for pulling up in the loading zone outside the apartments, come and check in, get a wad of keys including two sensors, and get incorrect directions for driving two more blocks, turn right, and fumble your way through the parking garage with one or more of the sensors, which didn't work. Luckily, we made it back to the lobby and the same clerk walked us to the room and fumbled with the key for the elevator, then the key for our room, explaining the entire time that \"this is a private building\". We had a much easier time getting access to everything than he did. Room: Beautiful! Oversized with decent linens, workspace, big closet, and nice bathroom with good amenities. Loved the simple touches that make all the difference, like the DVD player (movies available in the lobby) and complimentary soft drinks in the fridge. The shower was interesting; curtain so dense that stepping into the shower was like stepping into a dark cave, and I had to partially bent to get my head wet (I'm 5'7\"). Surprised that towels weren't of better quality. Decor in the room was pretty tired and kind of 1950's style, with generic prints of flowers and fruit that could have been purchased at Wal-Mart. Room service was impeccable, everything was perfectly clean and we had more towels than we needed, which was very nice. It bugged me that there was no comfortable place to watch TV; one bed was too far away to see it comfortably, and the other bed was off to the side. There was also a ridiculous amount of noise from other rooms, I suspect due to a lack of insulation in the walls. We could've jumped into our neighbors' conversation at any time, every word was crystal-clear. Overall, it was a good stay; we didn't interact much with the staff, and when we did we felt as if they were being courteous, but nothing more. They were surprisingly uninformed about restaurants and nightlife beyond the Brazilian restaurant next door (not worth the money) and the techno clubs the 21-ish age group frequents. At check-out we got a nice send-off with a promotional offer for returning guests, and will probably take advantage of that offer and stay at the Four Sisters on Whidbey Island next time.

At night homeless people slept or walked around that atrium and we did not feel comfortable with that. The room was so dark that it was impossible to shave or put on makeup very well in addition to being very depressing and there was zero view to look at. So, the second day, after much ado and a few wasted hours later, we were transferred to a 2 bedroom queen in an entirely other part of the hotel. This part was in the tower that has mostly apartments in it and the hotel has a few rooms that they rent out. We enjoyed this room much more although it still wasn't all that clean.

Matt's in the Market was a great place for sandwiches....the catfish sandwich you won't find better. Pike Street Chowder on Alley Street has the best clam chowder in the City.

While not impolite, staff lacked any sense of graciousness or enthusiasm. In the check-in process, a rapid stream of information as to \"What was where\" in the hotel was delivered in a robotic, barely decipherable fashion. We felt neither welcomed nor acknowledged as guests. Although clean, with a comfortable bed, the decor of our\"elegant Superior Room\" felt out-dated and lack-lustre. Teddy bears and cheap potpourris do not belong in a smart downtown hotel anymore, in my opinion, especially with such a totally different theme in the lobby area. There were no clean wine glasses in the Library for our afternoon drinks and the hors d'oeuvres needed refreshing, and we had to trail up to the front desk to get attention. Very over-heated room and music far too loud. Skipped the whole experience the next afternoon. Quality and assortment of the breakfast food was okay, but the fresh fruit (cantaloupe and melon) was hard and tasteless. Coffee was fine one day, thin the next. The breakfast room was windowless and felt like a generic basement conference room with a few artificial bouquets and some easy chairs thrown in an attempt to soften the effect. While there were 2 little tables set up in a corner of a much more open area overlooking the courtyard, they were jammed in alongside artificial plants and did not provide a sense of privacy from the traffic flow up and down the ramps nearby.

I stayed in two different rooms (#1 and #17) was impressed by the HUGE size and beautiful decor in both rooms.

There is free high-speed cable internet, and I was able to get free wireless internet from Tully's Coffee while in the room. The buffet breakfast include two hot entrees (usually a quiche and something else like bread pudding), fresh fruit, yogurt, cereal, hot oatmeal, and a selection of juices, teas and coffee. The only drawback to the property is that it is somewhat difficult to check in/park. You have to check in on First Street, and it is often difficult to find a place in front of the Inn to wait. You will then get a parking pass, but due to the one-way nature of the streets you will have to go 2 blocks past the Inn, and make a giant U-turn to park in the back.

You enter a common reception lobby (no more) shared by the Inn guests and the apartment dwellers. There are two desks. One of the left for the apartments and one on the right for the Inn. There is no mixing these businesses. The appartment desk will not \"give you the time of day\" if you're there for the Inn. We figured that out pretty quickly. The Inn desk was very nice, however.

It included hot quiche, bread pudding and hot oatmeal as well as the usual assortment of breads, muffins, cereals and drinks. As not every property suits every travellor, I will mention the challenges at this place. Checking in was a bit tricky. There are a couple of three-minute parking stalls in front and they were full when we arrived. After circling the block a few times, my friend got out of the car to register while I continued circling.

It's also a secure building that requires a special key to get in and out which is a good safety feature. They have a lovely wine and cheese reception which is complimentary and great after a full day of sightseeing. Parking is a bit strange in the garage but is provided at only 15.00 a day which is a good value. The hotel also only charges 8% tax as it's a small boutique property where the major chains charge 16%.

Two of us took a city bus to the hotel and checked the bags until the room was ready and the other two rented a rental car from the airport. You have to pull up at the front of the hotel and unload from the street, get your keys and then back your car around the block in the parking garage and take an elevator back up to the lobby. Traffic was bad and i missed the one way turn to get me in front of the hotel so i went directly to the parking garage. Fortunately someone that lived there unlocked the elevator door so we could go up to the lobby. You must check in first because your room key is also the elevator key. We had two queen beds in a very spacious room, refridgerator, and balcony. All two queen beds overlook the Harbor steps and we could also see the water and pier from our room. They do not advertise these rooms as waterfront but you could see the water when sitting on the right side of the patio table (comes with 2 chairs) from all of these rooms facing the Harbor steps SW tower( i believe) You do look past the freeway to see the harbor area. The room is not sound proof and ear plugs would be necessary for light sleepers. We could here road noise and the door opening into our hallway at night. Our Room #64 was right next to this entrance door. We enjoyed the morning breakfast of quiche, potatoes, yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, cakes ect. The free pop and water in the room was a nice touch. Except there was only 2 sodas and one water our first night and we were paying for four of us in a room. House keeping left 8 the next night. The afternoon wine was average and they din't have anyone working the room. We were told to come up and ask if the wine ran out but who wants to run up and ask. Two of us ran along the waterfront in the morning, down the harbor steps and one block further. The Argosy cruise loads right there. We jogged down to the edgewater hotel and circled around pike street for Starbucks and French pastries at 7:30 am on a Sunday. There are many food choices nearby. The Seattle museum is directly across the street and one day we hopped a city bus that stopped in front of it to the Seattle center, walked around there and took the monorail near the Space needle to Westlake mall for shopping. Nordstroms and Macy's ect are all right around here. We walked back to the hotel from there. If you love wine the Purple Cafe was fun and had alot of energy. We felt a little under dressed but sat at the bar and forgot about it after a few glasses of wine. We had dinner at the Wild Ginger a couple blocks away it was about $50 a person with drink and dinner. Lots of energy here too. A reservation is advised. I would definitely stay here again. While i was here on a girls weekend i would bring my family. (kids 9 and 10) There was a pool, sauna, hottubs, weight room, barbque area, indoor basketball court. However I only noticed one family with kids there while we were there. I joggged by the waterfront Marriot which is on the opposite end of the waterfront and thought this would also be a good choice. Its closer to the Space Needle and you can enter pike street from the opposite end. It appears to have serveral different size balconies which look toward the water and the indoor/outdoor pool looked cool. Its close the the cruise ships sailing to Alaska and would be a great hotel to stay in before a cruise. I hope this helps.

The rooms had high ceilings and a fireplace. The amenities were also great, with an accessible gym and daily breakfasts that included oatmeal, cereal, breads, and frittatas. The staff was very friendly and was free to answer any questions we had. While these were great, there were a few drawbacks. First, during our stay, the weather in Seattle ranged from cool to pleasant with a few sprinkles in between. Unfortunately, the Inn blasted the common areas with heat that eventually affected the temperature of our room. While we were excited to have a fireplace, it was never used...and in fact, we turned on the ceiling fan and used the AC unit to cool off our room. In another attempt to cool ourselves down, we tried to open the French doors to let some air in. To our dismay, the top hinge to the right door was not attached and the door looked like it would fall off. A second concern was quality/cleanliness of the bedroom/bathroom area. The bath towels were older and frayed and one of the bathrobes that was hanging had makeup stains on the collar. Also, there were stains on the floor prior to our use which was not wiped off by the cleaning crew. Third, the bed and pillows were not the most comfortable.

You have to sign a form that states if you do not return the room keys you will pay some fee (25-75$--i cannot recall the exact amount.)--which just seemed tacky, in light of the clients that this chain attracts. Not all rooms are in the tower which houses the breakfast/front desk/pool/library. Its not a far walk, but if it is raining it means getting wet carrying your food back to your room. (2) wine and food in afternoon ----this was a wonderful touch, except they never replenished the food--even such items as crackers or cheese.

It appeared that if you did not get to the function at the start time you may or may not get any food or have any plates to put it on. ----also a note for people with food allergies--the dishes were not labeled (even with names of the dishes) so it might be difficult to determine if you can eat the item.", "Date": "September 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evergreen, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cA Great Place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "Bcogswell", "ReviewID": "UR5794974", "Content": "The staff was friendly.

Afternoon \"tea\" provided us with a light and tasty array of hors d'ouevres and wine or coffee/tea and a lovely library where we enjoyed our conversation and treats after our daily activities. The staff was more than courteous and accommodating; they exhibitied a friendly manner and a willingness to help us find restaurants, limos, etc. Our tour van picked us up right in front of the hotel. When in Seattle, we will again choose the Inn at harbor Steps.", "Date": "August 4, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upper Marlboro, MD", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back\u201d", "Author": "crewealp", "ReviewID": "UR5487392", "Content": "What a neat place.

You could enjoy your wine in the library or on the patio outside, and meet other guests. Breakfast was more than sufficient and tasty w/ fresh baked breads, cereal, an egg dish, juices, fruit, coffee, etc. The inn was a few short blocks from Pike's Market and Pioneer's Square.

Though the Inn at the Harbor Steps is close to water and has no views of it from their hotel rooms, it more than made up for it in their service, the complimentary \"happy hour\" and breakfast. Our room was tastefully decorated. We even inquired about the paint color in the bathroom-we liked it so much. Definitely within walking distance to many major downtown and waterfront attractions. Also, the number of fine restaurants nearby is almost endless.

There's a huge garden courtyard that is very peaceful. They had 5 Star amenities- 2 saunas, a jacuzzi, fitness centers, tiny lap pool, beautiful large lap pool (both indoor) and our favorite thing- an indoor basketball court. The breakfast (aside from a very salty quiche and not-very-hot coffee) was nice. I liked the oatmeal, thick raisin toast and fresh fruits. We paid $175 for our room and around $200 for our parents. The latter room was exquisite but not as described. We thought that a \"deck with a view of the water\" was just that. But you had to peer around the corner to catch a glimpse of the water- disappointing. Everything though is incredibly clean and the rooms have awesome bathrooms. We did not have wi-fi but could have gotten a cable from front desk to have free DSL in our room. There are not many interesting restaurants in immediate area for dinner (more tourist-y, over-priced ones), but this hotel is lovely. You can walk to Pike Market and it's totally safe at any time of the day or night.

The room had some excellent features -- a comfy bed (complete with teddy bear), a working fireplace, small TV, two alarm clocks, a wet bar with frig and comp. beverages, coffee machine and a very large bathroom. Internet was free. The only negative beyond the view was that the grout around the tub had some black mildew, which should have been taken care of. A personalized welcome note was left on the bed. Front desk staff: Very nice and exceptionally helpful. Other features: On my level, a library and gym. A tea/wine reception every evening in the library, with nice cheeses and cakes. Complimentary breakfast included (essentially a continental breakfast). Lots of books also in the room. Outside: Very near the Museum and a short walk to restaurants and Pike Place market.

It's a quick walk to Pike Place Market, Seattle Aquarium, the downtown shopping district, Pioneer Square, and the ferries. It's also two blocks away from my favorite seafood restaurant, Elliott's. ROOMS: The rooms are extremely large - they appear to actually be studio apartment floorplans since the majority of the building is residential.

Beds are comfortable, there is LOTS of closet space, and a small balcony with table and chair overlooking the Harbor Steps.

DRAWBACKS: Our room was right by the entrance door to the Inn rooms in the building so we could hear the door closing at night as people came in and out.
