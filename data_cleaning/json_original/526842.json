All of the hotels were pretty average, but Apolo has the distinction of being the worst by quite a stretch. Technically it should be okay. The location was close to the tapas bars, the room was clean, the linen was clean, the room was large, the lift worked, the water was hot, so I spent quite a while trying to figure out why I disliked the hotel so much. I think it has two main issues. One is the location - it's in a street full of Chinese import companies, which is somewhat bizarre when in Spain, and also pretty dark and grimy. But the main issue is maintenance. The lino on our floor wasn't flat. There were marks on the walls no-one had bothered to wash off. The back of the bathroom door looked like a large dog had tried to claw its way out, and the highlight was when I tried to hang the shower hose on the rail and the whole thing fell off the wall. Another highlight was when returning to our rooms in the evenings, we had to show the man behind reception our hotel cards to prove that we were guests. For some of the travellers on my trip, this hotel was enough to put them off doing another trip with the tour company.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cWorst hotel experience we've had in Europe\u201d", "Author": "TinaWa019", "ReviewID": "UR115172223", "Content": "The main advantage for this hotel is that it's in a good location within easy walking distance to everything, and it's reasonably cheap. The rest was incredibly disappointing. One of the main receptionists really made our arrival hellish, ranting at us angrily in Spanish (we understand a little, but he wouldn't slow down and use simple words) although we realised much later he knew enough English to have communicated his point: we had to pay for our stay in advance. He could not have been ruder on all occasions we dealt with him, and it seems he was like this with all guests. Might help if you're fluent in Spanish. We booked a double room but got two single beds - very uncomfortable and hard. You get only one small flat pillow. The rooms all seem to be smoking rooms. The curtains, bed covers and walls reek. The bathrooms are fine but the towels smell of old pasta and I had a big ball of hair in mine. The toilet flush really is quite something - very powerful and loud. The internet is expensive - we paid around 15 euros for 3 days. Bear in mind that the majority of Madrid has free wifi and most Spanish hotels we stayed at had free wifi too. After checking out, if you want to leave your bags at the hotel, they're kept in the reception's foyer hall. They assure you there's always someone watching, but we weren't too excited by the free access. Over all, my advice is to keep looking. There are much better options.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cCheap, clean, friendly and central\u201d", "Author": "skatie74", "ReviewID": "UR82499011", "Content": "I just stayed four nights here and whilst I agree with the comments about the noisy bathroom and general plain decor, if you literally want to rest your head on a comfortable bed in a room that is thoroughly cleaned every day, you won't get better for 45 Euros a night.

And I've never heard a louder toilet! I was actually woken twice during the night by the noise of other people flushing theirs, despite the fact that the rooms were very quiet otherwise. Location-wise the hotel is in quite a scary looking neighbourhood and on our way back from dinner the one night we stayed at the Apolo we saw someone being arrested just round the corner, and several police cars just circling the streets. But the hotel is very close to some more positive areas of Madrid, including Plaza Mayor within a 5 minute walk.

I was initially disappointed to find no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, and the use of the television depended on an additional \u20ac10 - something I'd expect to be included like any other hotel from Prague to Ireland to the USA! The breakfast was VERY MISERLY. If you're expecting a continental breakfast of cereals, croissants and fruit juices you will be heart broken to learn that all you will receive is a milky coffee and a single cake!! It was noted that those who spoke fluent Spanish and were tanned, were able to get another piece!!! The condition and cleanliness of the room was VERY GOOD. No mould around the bathroom, and daily servicing made for a nice room. There was no view, but in such a densely packed city as a Madrid you would be hard pressed to see much anyway. The WORST part was the NOISE from within the hotel. Rooms 101, 102 and 103 (and maybe others on the other 2 floors) are next to the lift, and with people coming and going, dragging suitcases and supplies, and talking VERY LOUDLY, it made for DISRUPTED SLEEP. The water supply was also very noticeable! Noise echoed around the hotel since no part of the hotel was carpeted or matted. In conclusion, if you can sleep through noisey natives, can cope without the freedom of making yourself tea/coffee but want a cheap jumping off point to the metro, this hotel maybe suitable. For \u00a3175 per week, I'd expect a better breakfast though!", "Date": "September 16, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Apolo", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d526842-Reviews-Apolo-Madrid.html", "Price": "$59 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Juanelo 24</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28004</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "526842", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/be/14/be1403f517e5b1d59b7ba5c38980deec2large.jpg"}}
