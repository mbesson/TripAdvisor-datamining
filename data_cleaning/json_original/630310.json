The pub also serve's breakfast although we did not eat there, the rooms were clean and spacious, we had a family room as there was three of us. and as we booked it in advance it was a great rate of \u00a325, normally the rooms are around the \u00a375 mark. Our room was on the ground floor and contrary to other reviews we did not here the tube line at all. Just one point to note though there is no baths in the rooms just showers, but these are larger than a normal shower cubicle and are very nice.

The receptionist was very helpful and available all the time we were there. Only thing that I have mentioned to Travelodge is that it is not signposted well enough to be able to see it from the busy road, so we went past it and had to turn around. The car park was well-lit and felt secure enough to leave the car overnight. I would certainly book this Travelodge again, but you'd have to book early to get a good deal!

Not ideal for children. Reception staff (the males ones) were rude and unhelpful. Toby carvey next door was awful, staff were miserable and told us food was not being served when it was. breakfast is served to you in a bag outside your room at 7:00 if you want it - school packed lunch style. Hotel is extremely noisy, did not sleep a full night at all while we were there. The pipes are noisy, therefore if next door or upstairs/downstairs are having a shower you get woken up!! The location on the other hand is excellent, walking distance to a small tesco (convenient to buy toilet roll), and a boots, newsagent and a lovely chinese restraunt around the corner.

We found it reasonable then and well maintained. The second time we stayed in December 2007/January2008, we noticed that in the few months since our first visit, the place had gone downhill and there was an uncaring attitude of staff. The auto closing and locking security door to the rooms was not working \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a couple of weeks later one of the bar staff attempted to fix the door at the front of the building but when I opened this a few minutes later a large bar of metal fell down and narrowly missed hitting me in the head. Obviously some cost saving attempted by not employing someone qualified to do the job. Breakfasts are included in room charge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c many days we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother going to breakfast as the standard had fallen. There were two particularly bad mornings with no tea bags, no bread, no jams, cheese etc, no juice, no plates and out of date yoghurt which was not kept chilled. The bowls, cutlery and plates (if there are any there) are ALWAYS dirty. There always appear to be staff around but no one is ever doing very much. The breakfast staff are also housekeeping staff and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appear to have had training in either. Check in: It can take ages to get served as you have to wait at the bar to check in. A few times we have arrived at this hotel at 8pm at night to find that the requested pullout bed was not made up. I have had to go to the pub to request toilet paper, bedding, towels and pillows at 9pm at night and then had to make my daughter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s bed. The duvets and pillows are of very poor quality. The beds are cheap and lumpy with springs poking out, the pillows are flat (and they only give you one each). I always request extra pillows, but sometimes there just aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t any, so I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve had to fold up hand towels and put them inside the pillowcase. Many times I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been given the key to the housekeeping rooms to help myself to my own pillows, towels, bedding because the bar staff are busy and I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to wait till they can come down to the rooms to get what I've requested. In a room with 2 adults and 2 children we were seldom given four bath towels. After one housekeeping session we had one bath towel and 6 hand towels for 4 people. There are huge numbers of fire doors in this place and they slam loudly whenever anyone enters or leaves their room, as do the rooms to the doors \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I was woken many times every night. Bedside lights were broken, handwash containers broken off walls (these had not been re-attached to the walls since our previous stay in April), TV remote control not working, mould in shower cubicle (easily remedied by application of mould remover). The bathroom would benefit from a heated towel rail as the room was cold and the towels stayed wet even though they were small and thin. There's not much room for four wet bath towels. There is an electric wall heater on the wall so you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dry anything on the radiator. Walls are very thin \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I could hear the person next door turning their light switch off and on and flushing the toilet. Xmas eve we had a child next door screaming all night and someone above us who was thumping around on the floor all night - sounded like they were moving furniture - another sleepless night in this place. Rooms are very small, not recommended for more than two people, or perhaps a family with one small child. This hotel appears to be a haunt for travelling workmen who leave early in the morning with lots of door slamming. Pub is OK but the glasses are grubby. Now that smoking is not allowed inside the pub, there are cigarette butts all over the ground outside and in the planters. The beer garden is always full of dirty plates, food scraps, litter and empty glasses. I recommend this hotel for anyone who sleeps without a pillow and is deaf or a very sound sleeper.

After trawling through hundreds of hotel websites who wanted \u00c2\u00a3150 per night, we came across the Innkeepers lodge who offer sunday night free if you stay friday and saturday, at \u00c2\u00a375 per night we booked it straight away. Continental breakfast was also included in the price, which you don't find at many other places. Upon arriving at 4pm to check in we found the cutest little building snuggled into a quiet corner of Snaresbrook just off a busy road. Check in took less than a minute and the staff were more than happy to help with anything. The hotel building is extremely secure. You need an electric key to get into 2 main doors and then another to enter your room. Staying in London I feel security is of the utmost importance. The room itself was a gem. Tidied to tee and the most spacious one we've ever stayed in. It was perfectly heated, with plenty of storage space. They'd also provided a bottle of champagne on ice and some helium balloons, which i'd previously rung up about. Although that extra tough did cost an extra \u00c2\u00a340 it was well worth it. The facilities are also excellent with a Tv offering 10 channels including 3 sky sports, sky news and sky 1. The bathroom was immaculate and the room was cleaned every day unless we left a note on our door. The location couldn't be any better. Literally 1 minute walk from a busy underground and 3 bus stops close by. Also just across the road is Snaresbrook crown court and a wonderful lake, which makes for great pictures. Next to the underground station is a small arcade of shops, most of which are closed at the weekend, or closed full stop but if the Toby Cavery doesn't take your fancy there's a lovely chinese restaurant. The pub was lovely, if you wanted just a few drinks or some pub food it was really quiet and a nice environment. The Carvery was always packed, but what else do you expect with the quality of food at such great prices. Breakfast also took place in the pub which was so relaxed in the morning, we were often the only ones in there and got the best seat in the house. You could chose from bagels, toast, pastries, cereals, yoghurts, fruit, juice, tea, coffee, hot chocolate... and the best bit is you could have as much as you like!
