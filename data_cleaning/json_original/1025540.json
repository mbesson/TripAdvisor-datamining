It was great in every way. The location is perfect for access to the beach and shopping/dining and still quiet. The staff went above and beyond in all categories. The breakfast ladies made breakfast to order with a smile. The outdoor terrace where breakfast is served is lovely. The desk staff helped us find great restaurants for dinner and helped with reservations for meals and other activities as well. The cleaning staff also were superlative. The room could use more space for sitting other than on your bed and a couple of drawers for storing clothing. But these are minor points. There were several nice places to sit outdoors to read or drink a beer and eat snacks if we wanted. The weather was always great so we did not really care about being in our room except to sleep. The craziness of 5th ave was close but not audible. We would recommend this hotel to couples who want a great value and service.

We enjoy staying in north Playa, a more quiet, less frenetic area. We loved this hotel: nice size rooms with fridge & comfortable beds, updated bathroom with waterfall shower, thick towels, his/her bathrobes & slippers - which were a very nice touch. Breakfast,served roof-top, was wonderful, if not on the menu, just ask and they will gladly accommodate. Recommend you take advantage of the complimentary beach passes to Las Palapas, much less noisy and hectic than Mamitas. A convenience store right on the corner sells wine, beer and snacks, the restaurant Kool Fish will deliver food to the rooftop, or poolside making this another unique feature.

The good reviews area effect our experience. Here are some reasons to stay here: 1) Location! It's on 5ta Avenida, which is the main tourist drag in l,aya del Carmen, but it's at the quieter, less obnoxious end of the street. Bring comfy flip flops or shoes and the walk to the busy end isn't terrible--we did it several times. There's good food nearby, including some tasty restaurants (Pachamama, ComoComo, Luna Maya, Kool Fish, Drupas38, etc.), a cool little craft beer place (The Beer Club), and beach clubs. 2) Breakfast! Many reviews rave about breakfast, and they're right. Three wonderfully friendly women run the rooftop breakfast service. There is fresh squeezed juice, breads, fresh fruit, yogurt, and a good selection of breakfast main courses (omelette, pancakes, quesadillas, and a daily special that changes). Don't forget to tip them a little something each time or give them a big tip at the beginning. They deserve it. 3) Helpful concierge/registration staff! The women who rotate at te front desk were helpful. They had good recommendations, helped us rent a car to go to Coba, and always asked us about our day. 4) Free beach club access! We only went to two of the three options. We really liked Las Palapas. They provide towels and there's no drink/food consumption minimum. We got there early and got a good spot and our service was great. We also went to Mamitas, which we didn't like. They don't give you towels here, so you have to vring them from te hotel. Awful service, crowded, loud music... it wasn't at all comfortable or relaxing. Canibal Royale is the third option which we didn't try. It's a good place to go if you want old since they have a minimum food/drink consumption limit. 5) Housekeeping staff! Every day we had a new work of towel art on our bed. It made coming back to the room fun (and funny). 6) Purified water! They have purified water cookers on each floor. You can fill up bottles or your glasses, which saves you money on buying bottled water. Of course, if you want bottled water there's a little store at the end of the block--very close. 7) The door guy! He's always smiling and so polite. My only complaints are the plumbing and complimentary toiletries. 1) The plumbing. If you try to take a shower when other people on lower floors are also showering, expect no water. The shower went dry when I was trying to shower at 8 one morning. 2) the complimentary shampoo and conditioner aren't great. Bring your own or buy it there. It made my hair feel icky. Overall this place is great. It's a good home base for exploring this area--close to Tulum, Cozumel, Coba, etc. The rates make it especially great. Casa Ticul was great. (PS - I have a horrible bed bug phobia and search every room I stay in. I searched our room pretty thoroughly. Our room was bed bug free--found absolutely no physical evidence of them and received no bites over 6 nights in our room--Room #8.)", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value For Non-Resort Holiday\u201d", "Author": "Brian T", "ReviewID": "UR125158023", "Content": "Much of our friends and families like to do the all-inclusive vacations and rarely leave the resort. We wanted the opposite: a comfortable, affordable hotel with good location to jump off to lots of different activities. Casa Ticul was perfect. The staff were very helpful, the room was clean, and the price was perfect. Our family spends a lot of time on the south end of 5th ave (low street numbers). We spent nearly our whole week nearer to the north side. What a complete difference. Our side is full of restaurants with very high ratings on trip advisor, lots of small shops, etc. The other side has all the huge stores and the less memorable restaurants. There is no burger king on our side! Mexican breakfast on the roof was tasty, although a bit inconsistent. A few days they had super tasty yogurt drinks and we really missed the rest of the time where they didn't. Wifi took a bit of doing to get working but once it worked it was great. Front desk staff are there 24/7 and are very eager to help. The rooms are not huge. I found the feather pillows uncomfortable. The pool is very small, but we are not pool people so that was ok. Basically, it was a great jumping off place and a great place to end up in the evening. So many great restaurants and activities near by.

There is a lovely small pool in the courtyard of the property, a little bigger than a lap pool, with chairs and tables around it. This place makes the most out of every inch for services and ambiance! A fantastic hot breakfast of eggs, pancakes, waffles, omlettes, etc all cooked to order, as well a variety of fresh-squeezed juices, fresh fruit, cereal, breads, and terrific coffee or espresso (which is just a more concentrated version of the coffee it appears, but a big cup of it!) is served from 8-10:30 on their super-pretty rooftop terrace that overlooks a quieter section of Fifth Avenue. Lots of umbrellas and sail shades are there so you won't roast to death in the sun. Big electric fans help out when it is too much of a scorcher. The location is on a developing area of Fifth that has terrific restaurants and a corner store on the same small block. The pedestrian area starts two blocks away to the south. While they are not on the beach, they will still give you a complimentary towel/drink on one of 3 beach clubs in PDC, (Canibal Royal, Mamitas, and one other that I can't remember right now) so you can still enjoy the beach every day.

More than anything, I liked the design of the hotel. Everywhere were little details that really showed that someone with great taste took the time to make it a pleasant place to be. Another thing I ended up liking about the hotel was its location. I was a little concerned that it was so far at the end of Avenida 5, but that ended up being a positive feature. In the years since I had last been to Playa del Carman, the town has exploded in size, and down on the main drag it gets a little Cancunish and mall-like... and overpriced. Casa Ticul inhabits a spot that feels a little like the Playa del Carmen I remember: still plenty of restaurants and bars and the other amenities, but somehow, friendlier, hipper and more reasonably priced. And if you need to go to Little Cancun down the road, it's an easy pleasant walk. One small small complaint: the wifi is nearly useless in the rooms.

The transportation that the hotel provides for a fee, is worth every penny, especially because Playa del Carmen is approx 1 hour from the airport. The hotel is right at the beginning of 5th avenue, so there is a walk into town, which I enjoyed! The key attribute of this hotel is the breakfast every morning. I wasnt sure if we would get enough to eat for the day trips we planned on taking, but was pleasantly surprised that it actually was a full breakfast. The trio of ladies that make this happen are extrememly efficient and friendly. We never waited over 10 minutes for our meals. There was a different special everyday, but the last day was my favorite, the omelette poblano. It was amazing! This saved us a ton of money and was a great way to start the day.

It's on 5th Avenue, the busy tourist street, but it's at the north quiet end of the street. This means you can walk to restaurants and shops and you can also walk to the beach, but you don't have to run the gauntlet of souvenir sellers as soon as you step out of your hotel. The hotel has arrangements with three different beach clubs, we tried all three beaches and preferred the one at La Palapa, but the food at Canibal Royal was pretty good and Mamitas is closer to the busy area of 5th Avenue. It's nice to have a choice. Breakfast on the roof was always good, they usually offered freshly made omelets or other egg dishes, and there was juice and fruit and home made bread. And the coffee was good. The girls making breakfast were a pleasure to deal with, always cheerful and quick to respond to requests. We tipped them at the beginning of our week's stay so we wouldn't have to remember to bring money up to the terrace, and they remembered us and treated us like old friends every morning. Our only complaint about the hotel is that the rooms are very small and the hotel itself is also very small. However the hotel is well designed and makes use of every bit of space, but if anyone is making noise in the hallways or the pool area it travels (we don't use AC and like to keep our windows open). Fortunately there is a no children policy so the hotel is quieter than it would be if families were staying. The wi-fi is fine in the lobby, not so good in the rooms (we were in number 11). The staff is very very helpful. The breakfast staff, the housekeepers, the receptionists, all were extremely friendly. They know the area well and have lots of good advice and suggestions. We sent our laundry out when we were there and the staff took care of all the arrangements to have it picked up and delivered, then after it came back we realized my husband had left a chain and medal in his shorts pocket. As soon as we told them the front desk sent someone with my husband to talk to the laundry staff, the owner of the laundry was notified, and the woman who had been in charge of doing the wash produced the chain. She had no intention of keeping it, she had put it away for safe keeping. It was a wonderful ending to an incident that could have been distressing, since the medal is from Russia and irreplaceable. We had a long talk with the owner of the laundry who turned out to be an interesting guy. We would stay here again and would recommend it to friends.

I visited many hotels in playa this trip, some smell like mold, some are too close to discotecas, some are too family friendly, some are just old. This hotel is perfect although the wireless internet could use some more investment. We had to keep the laptop along the far side of one window for it to work. Another wireless router would be nice. There was one little difficulty, we were give the wrong rate per a phone conversation. I recapped the discussion afterwards via email and received confirmation. After we had unpacked and were pleased with the hotel, a different person informed me that the rate was incorrect that was given to me and tried to talk about a new rate. The resolution was fine after a few days the manager honored the rate give to me for the days we stayed and were not able to resolve the situation, due to her absense.

The cleanliness of the room was really good. Large bathroom with a rainshower. We had new towels (daily they made funny towel-art) and sheets everyday. The pool is OK, not really big, but perfect to have quick refreshing dip. The service of the hotel was perfect, nice friendly staff (except the guy who was there on our day of arrival).

Don't forget to ask for a voucher at the reception of the hotel). The breakfast at Casa Ticul was really nice, daily fresh squeezed juices (The pineapple & mint juice was the best!!) There was also a daily Mexican breakfast special which was good as well. Only thing that disappointed us was the day of arrival. We actually hoped for a bit of extra service because it was our honeymoon (the hotel knew it was our honeymoon). For example a romantic decorated room when you arrive or at least someone who helps you carry your 3 suitcases up to your room. My wife and I had to drag our suitcases up the stairs (not cool after travelling for 12 hours) while the male employee was sitting behind his desk doing nothing.

The breakfast on the roof patio was amazing and definitely got the day started off right. Also, the passes to Mamita's beach were wonderful and helped us spend a relaxing day on the beach. The hotel staff also helped us book our tour of Tulum and Coba, which were both great. The only thing that wasn't 100% awesome was that the wi-fi did not reach into our room; however, the computers in the lobby worked well and I try not to be completely connected when I'm on vacation anyway!

The shower is ultra modern with a rainfall shower head, they have wonderful toiletries including even mosquito repellent (I didnt notice any mosquitos however) and a nice TV. The WiFI was easy to use and fairly fast, although sometimes I had to stand near the window to get a good signal. The room has a fan and a good air conditioning unit, we turned off the air conditioning everytime we left the room for the day yet it was always nice and cool in the room. I saw other guests just left their windows open to allow the breeze in. The mini bar has very reasonably prices, $1 water, $1.50 gatorades. This was the first time in my life I actually helped myself to the minibar since it was reasonably priced. The breakfast on the rooftop is so wonderful. There are plenty of seats, plenty of shade, and plenty of options. The room cleaning was always great, we'd come back to really intricate towel sculptures. It seemed the more we tipped the more amazing the sculpture, it was fun! They give you coupons for free chairs and umbrellas at Mamitas beach club. I highly recommend you go there, its on a great spot on the beach, has a great bar and restaurant or they bring the food to your chair. Try the fried fish, its good. Try and get there before noon, the chairs and beds fill up fast. The design of the hotel was genius, it allowed for the pool to remain in the shade almost the entire day, so that you always have a refreshing swim away from the intense sun beams of doom that are plentiful in that tropical part of mexico. They always played tasteful background music that seems to only be audible if you are in the pool area. It was always quiet, we never heard another room. The only sounds I ever heard was the weird tropical birds in the morning that live in that part of the world. This hotel is located in what I kept heard being called \"The new avenida quinta\". If you are familiar with SoFi in South Beach, the area south of 5th street in South Beach Miami, this part 5th street in Playa del carmen is very similar. I don't think any travel guide or forum I visited prepared me for how tacky and awful 5th street /avenida quinta is in terms of tourist trap hell. Thankfully Casa Ticul is in the very nicest part of Avenida Quinta, at the very northern end. Also I noticed even if I caught a cab on that part of 5th street, I never got charged tourist prices of 50 pesos for any distance. It was more in the 25-35 peso range per ride. There are two small tiendas (convenience stores) located right next to the hotel, making it very easy and very cheap to get whatever small things you need, from beer, wine, lighters, snacks, water to aquas frescas. The restaurants near the hotel are the best. You are a short cab ride from El Dogon for authentic Tacos al Pastor, or a stone throw away from excellent steaks at El Facon, best breakfast at La Cueva del Chango, best small dive bar/lounge Casa Rosa, and best Mojitos and salsa dancing at La Bodeguita del Medio. This is the absolute best part of Playa del Carmen, there is no doubt. One tip: don't use the ATM right outside the hotel, it charges a large fee. Instead take a cab to a ATM located around 30th street for the best rates. I used Santander bank near the MEGA on 30th. Also the hotel offers many convenient tours. We did not use them for this, but they seemed to have many options at good prices. They have a nice computer area near the front desk if you want to check your email or the weather or whatever you need. It seems the front desk staff speaks good english and gives great advice for what to do or where to eat.

The breakfast was a great spread of fruit, juices, bread, and eggs. the breakfast is served on the terrace of the hotel which is covered with umbrellas and feels at least 20 degrees cooler than the intense heat you feel when walking in Playa.

We've been to Islas Mujeres and Holbox, Tulum, and Playa del Carmen a number of times and this year decided to stay in a nicer hotel rather than make a low price the key thing. Casa Ticul is far enough north on Fifth Avenue that the noise and jostling is a few blocks away and you're, instead, in a pleasant little neighborhood that's quiet and not built up, yet. It feels more like Mujeres and Holbox and Tulum than Cancun. Wonderful little restaurants are within three to five blocks and recommendations from those at the front desk were superb--the less money the meal cost, the better their recommendations. We ate a number of dinners at a little two-table place about five blocks away where the chicken tamales hit the spot night after night, and the bill never came to more than 70 pesos (athough we'd leave 100). I spent my days writing up on the roof terrace where breakfast is served. During the day usually no one is up there and the tables and chairs plus loungers and view are perfect for privacy and work. Each day I'd go into the shower up there and wet down my shirt and shorts three or four times during the afternoon so the water would evaporate, cooling me. Breakfast is the highlight: the cooks are kind and willing to make whatever you'd like. Delightful breakfasts with scrumptious juices and food all cooked and served by the most kind and helpful women you can imagine. We tipped them but the breakfasts are free. The pool is clean and cool, but its placement is impracticable and it was almost never used. Three things could be improved: first, there's no small table and chairs in the room, so the only place to read or write or do e-mail is on the bed; second, the bed is wonderful, but it sits on top of a platform that makes getting on and off quite awkward; and third, internet connectivity would be much improved if they added a couple wireless routers--especially one on the roof. From the owners to the people who sorted the laundry on the roof each afternoon, everyone was polite, cheerful, and willing to help with any need.

We were only a 3-5 minute walk to the beach and easy walk to the busier part of 5th Ave. We were provided passes to Mammitas on the beach where we could get some shade. While Mammitas can be quite the scene, you can park it a little closer to the Mahekal Resort (we would love to stay there but it was over our budget). Either way it was the perfect amount of time for us in Playa Del Carmen. I don't know that I could of stayed a week as it was a getting redundant in town and too touristy on the beach. The rooms were very very clean - with AC - the only thing is I personally hate AC and the ceiling fan had only one speed (which almost blew us off the bed - a small laughing moment for us!). We were fortunate that it was not that hot in the nights so we kept the AC low. The bed was super comfortable and the room was well cared for. The bathrooms super clean! This is not a 5 star resort, but for us it was perfect. We are not the types who like all-inclusives with everything 'taken care of' - we are a bit more adventurous - so we really enjoyed this place.

My husband was hesitant as we travel to this area quite frequently and have always stayed at large all-inclusive resorts. From the moment we checked in, we had no regrets! Our room was lovely, most comfortable bed we have ever had on vacation, everything in the room was high quality. The rooftop breakfast was delicious. Staff were above and beyond courteous and always willing to help, not like some of the other resorts when you would wait forever or try to find someone who spoke english. Sitting areas throughout the resort were lovely. Pool area fantastic! Restaurants within walking distance. We ate at a fish restaurant (Kool Fish) right next door that was fabulous and a pizza restaurant across the street just as good (great sangria and pizza). Lots of little markets in the same block for snacks, etc. Shopping district of Playa Del Carmen within walking distance. If we weren't afraid that we would upset family members we would have opted to stay at Casa Ticul and cancel the wedding resort reservations we had. We used ground transportation that the hotel arranged for us and I will tell you it was the BEST; we have tried various companies before and have had a few glitches, not this one, we were at the hotel in record time after arriving at the airport. We have a few recommendations to the resort: Some kind of table/chair and lamp in the guest rooms so you can sit and read especially if your travelling companion is still sleeping.

The hotel was a small boutique hotel on the not so busy side of 5th Ave. Out room was small but comfortable and had enough room for just the two of us. It was very humid so the de-humidifiers that were provided came in great help in keeping the room from becoming too humid. The beds were comfortable but we really didnt care for the pillows (personal preference). The room had a ceiling fan but it only was set on one speed of super fast which was good at night but sort of strong for going all day, they should find a way to change the speeds. The bathroom was nice with large shower , but the faucet on the vessel sink was way too long for the sink and got in the way when trying to wash your face or etc., this made water get all over the floor. They provided bathrobes and slippers which were a nice touch. The cleanliness of the room was very good and the housekeeping did a great job. We did have a few small ants in the shower that were attacking my razor, maybe they were attracted to the built in shaving bar on it which contains shea butter, but we never saw them again once I removed the razor from the shower. Also one night we saw a huge roach crawl under our door but then quickly he ran back out and down the hall when we looked out the door to make sure he was gone away from our room. Also there were mosquitoes in our room , we believe they came in from when the house keeping would open the windows during their cleaning. The only major thing we found to bother us about this hotel was the noise. I don't know if it was our room location or just the very thin walls and gaps above and below the door but you could hear everything. Doors would begin slamming at about 8am every morning and we could hear the housekeeping cleaning the rooms next to us. We had the dehumidifier , fan and AC on so it would block out some of the noise but it really didn't help. We had breakfast one morning on the roof top and it was good but only got to make it up there one morning, but would recommend it if you have time to make it up there. The location was good, about a 15 min walk to the action part of 5th, which we didn't mind walking to every night for dinner and drinks. We never felt unsafe or like the hotel was too far out. The beach was only about a 5 min walk down and was great. We did get the passes to the beach club on a Sunday but when we got there it was crazy packed so we just walked down the beach and found a spot to lay out at. Over all this was a great little hotel with very small problems but I would recommend it for a pleasant stay.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cOne of the BEST in Playa\u201d", "Author": "draghignazzo", "ReviewID": "UR65393100", "Content": "The staff was superb, great amenities, confortable rooms, fair price..

A representative met us outside the airport in Cancun and drove us directly to the hotel. We were so glad we prearranged the airport transfers as it is a bit chaotic outside the airport. The transfers were also less expensive and more comfortable than a taxi each way. Once we arrived at the hotel we found our room was very clean and had everything we needed including complimentary bath products which smelled delightful and wi-fi access. We found the beds to be very comfortable and every morning really enjoyed breakfast on the rooftop including toast, fresh fruit, ham & cheese, fresh juices, coffee, cappuccinos and daily yummy breakfast specials! After breakfast we would take a short walk to the beach and go to Mamitas beach club with coupons from the hotel for free beach chair rentals & a discount for the restaurant. We recommend getting to the beach by 11:00am or you run the risk of no umbrellas being available - these cost us 30 peso to rent and are definitely worth it! After spending the day in the hot sun the hotel room with its air conditioning and ceiling fan was a very comfortable cool escape from the heat outside. All the staff at the hotel were very friendly and the guys at the front desk were always able to give advice or information when we asked. We went on an excursion to Xel-Ha and Tulum that the hotel staff recommended and arranged which we really enjoyed. The hotel is located at the far end of 5th Avenue so there was a bit of a walk to get to the lively part of Playa Del Carmen, but really it was a good thing because we could escape the noise of downtown and retire to our quite, cool, room at the end of the day! We enjoyed everything about our stay at Hotel Casa Ticul and would definitely recommend staying here to friends. One strange thing - a few days before our last we asked for a late checkout for our last day and the front desk guy said it would not be a problem as our room had not booked. The next day we wanted to confirm our room still had not booked and there was a different guy at the front desk. He said it would be fine but subject to a $30 fee. We thought that was kinda strange cause the first guy never mentioned that part. We said that was okay as we didn't really have anywhere else to go before our shuttle to the airport. On the day we checked out the original guy was at the front desk and he said there would not be a charge for the late checkout! The only complaints we had were we had to pay cash for the excursion arranged by the hotel as they could not accept credit cards for that. But we found a bank machine on 5th Avenue so it really wasn't that big of a deal. Also, a couple of times we were woken up by loud guests in the hallway - I guess the room doors are a little light weight and the sound goes through. We were staying on the third floor and a few mornings it sounded like ponies were walking on the roof - staff getting ready for breakfast perhaps moving furniture? Not really a big deal either. At the end of the day, the positives really outnumber the very negatives about our stay at the Hotel Casa Ticul.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cI'll be definitely coming back again!!\u201d", "Author": "artistbaron", "ReviewID": "UR64749641", "Content": "Prior to arriving, I was in a lot of communication with the hotel because I was flying in late and a friend of mine was flying in two days before me but the reservations were in my name.

I really wanted to love it here and I will start with all of the positives because there are a lot of them: Liked the room, fell in love with the shower even though a lot of water ended up making it on the bathroom floor, nice amenities, they provide beach towels and passes to the beach club, air conditioner worked great, and very comfortable big bed. Sorry, we don't remember his name, but really appreciated the young gentleman with the mustache at the front desk- very kind, offered some nice suggestions, and always asked about our day. Breakfast was also pretty good and a nice bonus. On the negative side, I wish there was more storage in the room- we basically had to live out of our suitcases for a week. Our room also seemed to be last in-line for cleaning each day so it was usually after 3pm before it was cleaned - kind of cut into the afternoon nap plans. I guess the major issue was with the noise we encountered. Our room was the junior suite and the doors leading out to the balcony didn't seem to seal completely - there was at least a 1/2\" gap on each side. One thing I was scared about was bugs entering the room through this gap but that was never a problem --- the big issue became the noise level that filtered into the room. This seems to be a very busy street - especially in the morning (when it would have been nice to sleep-in while on vacation). Between the garbage truck and the loud motorcycles or scooters it was just like being at home since we live on a very busy street and really I want to forget about home while on vacation. Maybe if the balcony doors sealed correctly this noise issue could be eliminated or reduced. On our last night in the room there also was a mystery sound that was like listening to a clothes dryer with shoes in it (not pleasant). We walked outside and did not hear the sound but it was loud and clear inside our room. No idea where this was coming from! The sad part is that I really researched our choices on where to stay in Playa and so many of the other places mentioned noise issues and since noise was never mentioned in any of the other reviews I read Casa Ticul was our choice.

They had charged my credit card as soon as we walked in the door, or possibly before that, and would not let us out of the reservation.

We got our ticket for the beach since we could not check in right away. It poured down rain as we walked to the beach. We never did find the place they told us to go to. Our room was right on the court where people smoke and socialize. There is a very small pool there. The rooftop breakfast was very nice even though the wind was blowing everything about. The three block walk to the shopping area was safe, but I would not try it late at night. I stay in hostels when I travel to Europe alone, and thought of this as an upscale hostel. My partner hated this place. The staff is very pleasant and not their fault it is not on the beach and there is not a jaquzi in the room.

The bed was a bit too soft (preference issue) and the water pressure in the shower and the toilet was inconsistent. Perhaps it was just the room we were in but I found these things a bit uncomfortable. If I may recommend a couple things to the hotel owner...1) Consider bicycle rental for guests. It sure would be helpful in accessing the bus terminal and the main drag down 5th avenue. 2) Better in-room climate control. Maybe the A/C can be adjusted by the hotel staff before the guest arrives so the room does not feel so humid.

I did a lot of shopping and research before I booked this one, and later found out that I've made the best choice possible. It's an intimate boutique style hotel, that really feels more like B&B. The location is great, it's about two small blocks away from all of the excitement of 5th avenue, yet you don't have to worry about all of the noise at night, and I (young female) had no trouble walking back home at night even by myself. Can't say enough good things about service and people who work at the hotel. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming. Especially loved breakfasts on the roof: fresh fruit, freshly squeezed juices, expresso, and cooked to order omelets, crapes, and again all of this with incredibly friendly service and awesome atmosphere - a perfect way to start your day. Rooms were very comfortable as well. Nice size, modern decor, great shower (one of those rain-showers with high pressure), nice closet system (a lot of shelves), even a small fridge. Very clean. Every day we'd come back from the beach and find the room nicely cleaned up and refreshed. (The only couple of things you might want to prepare for : TV only has couple of English speaking channels with mostly old movies, but you can watch movies on Internet, or bring some with you. And bathroom door is glass - but it's matted glass, you can't really see through it.) Most importantly, they had free wireless internet and plenty of free street parking around. The beach is about 2.5 blocks down - an easy walk, and hotel gives you plenty of towels and passes to get lounge chairs, etc. There are tons of good restaurants around as well. Monkey Bar - about a 100 ft away - had great shrimp tacos and many other fairly inexpensive choices. The Uruguayan steak house (around the corner) was lovely as well (the deep they bring with bread is to die for), Piscaderia - left and left around the block - had great seviche, but no service in English. And my personal favorite - Molusko - just a couple of blocks down the 5th avenue on the right - had a great spanish twist on seafood - their tuna was unbelievable! There are several small markets right next door, so you can buy whatever you need there: water, sun-block, snacks. One more thing, this hotel does accept Amex (my Amex was the only card that didn't have foreign transaction fees), and I found out from someone we've met at a local bar, that most of hotels in the area do not accept it. He checked out a lot of hotels, and was telling us that he ended up paying more than what we paid, and his hotel wasn't even that nice or clean. So that reassured that Casa Ticul really was a great deal. Without a question, if I'm ever back in the area, this is the hotel I would stay at and I highly recommend it to anybody. As a matter of fact, I'm looking for an excuse to get back there as soon as possible :-)", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cUnbeatable price for location, service and comfort\u201d", "Author": "terratrotter", "ReviewID": "UR55139500", "Content": "This little boutique hotel is the best value in Playa del Carmen.

I first thing about Casa Tical you must realize is that it is on the new side of the town. 5th Ave is building out north and Casa Ticul is on the bleeding edge of that growth. So the building, rooms, beds, marble showers, etc are nice and new. The hotel is in a quiet and nice location, yet you are only a few minutes walk to the action. I felt very safe in all areas of Playa Del Carmen. We live in New York City, so I feel like I have a good gauge for judging safety, and I did not feel even the slightest bit threatened at any time. The people are generally very nice and outgoing. I feel like I even made some friends in town that I will keep touch with. The staff at Casa Ticul is great. They make you feel like family. My wife got a bit burned in the sun. Elisa must have noticed because she brought in a big piece of fresh aloe that she cut from her garden at home. I asked the front desk to set up a taxi to Tulum and they pointed out that renting a car is better and much cheaper. They were right, I am so happy I rented the car. It was easy and it let me explore so much more. Mauricio had the car delivered to the hotel and ready for me at 9am. They also were very helpful in setting up our excursions like the ATV trip we took. Any assistance you need, they are there. Unlike other portions of our trip to Mexico, Playa was a place where we were always out and about. There are so many great restaurants, bars, shops, and beaches. We really liked Di Vino, it is a bit pricey, but the food and wine were great. The foie gras was huge and amazing. Late night, the lounge by the pool at Deseo is a great place to get drinks, lye on a bed, relax, and socialize. We were not in our room much, but we always felt good coming back to Ticul to retire for evening. It honestly felt like going home. Because it was a quiet beach and restaurant filled week with my wife, Casa Ticul was perfect.

The hotel is a little bit far from Playa del Carmen night spots, which could be either good or bad depending on what you like. I didn't like the location because it was a long walk to restaurants and it was very hot, and also made us feel kinda of unsafe walking at night. The room was confi. No elevator, if you are lazy don't get a third floor room :). Staff was great, very helpful with everything. They are building a bar in the rooftop, right know they serve breakfast there for 3 bucks which is convenient I'm not sure if I would stay there again, I would do some more research first, I saw a lot of nice places closer to the beach and nightlife in Playa", "Date": "October 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, but located at outskirts of La Quinta, with noisy nighttime neighbors!\u201d", "Author": "nubux", "ReviewID": "UR47440825", "Content": "Very helpful and friendly staff, clean rooms, super nice linen and comfortable beds. However, fans were either on/off rather than with dimmer. Location is quiet most of the time, but on Saturday night, the salon/day lounge in front of the hotel blasts its music into 2AM+. Could not sleep with windows & door closed. Asked Mgt to do something about it, and they said they would. The guy stepped out of the hotel, stood around and wandered back in without confronting the spa/day lounge club. When confronted, he made up some story about the police being called, about him talking to the club owner. I had been observing him the whole time and he did none of what he said he did. If your customer complains, then either address it and tell them how you address it, or tell them you cannot fix the problem. Don't tell them you are fixing the problem, but in reality, doing nothing about it.

Our group was spread all over 5th, and my hotel room was one of the best. There is air that gets as cold as you want it, the beds are white down, the shower is all glass and really nice. It is 4 stories tall, with the 4th floor all being open. There is a spot to lay out and shower. This is also where they serve breakfast every morning. On the bottom floor is an outdoor pool that is surrounded by the hotel. It is smaller but very private. I never walked in or out of the place without a hotel staff sitting at the front desk.

It is located at the eastern end of busy 5th avenue and only a couple blocks from the beach. There was a convenience store next door where we were able to purchase water and snacks at a cheap price. There is construction all around due to 5th avenue's rapid expansion and soon it will become part of the hustle and bustle. Our room was clean and decorated in a modernly spare design. Though we expected it to be a bit bigger, we found the room quite comfortable and suitable for our needs. The bed was firm but very comfortable, perfect after a long day of sightseeing. The staff was also very attentive. Maurico and Alfredo took great care of us, assisting us with booking excursions and providing great advice on dining and culture.
