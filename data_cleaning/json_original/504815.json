Very good budget hotel. Two most amazing things.... location, location, location Sunset Blvd W just W of Highland Ave. Within 2 minutes you are on Hollywood Blvd. The second was the front office staff. He gave us a tour map and since we had a car we did the tour bus route that took us through Bel Air, Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Rodeo Drive and onto the Santa Monica Pier. Excellent afternoon. Circq du Soleil is on the Santa Monica beach - did not attend. Watched the surfers, fishermen (crabs & Lobsters) and the buskers performerances. We drove back, parked at the hotel and walked Hollywood Blvd. and checked the stars. Sleazy and just like Niagara Falls Ont type entertainment. The second day he gave us printed google maps to go to Universal Studios - what a blast... a must see in LA. The King Kong 3D show was amazing. Spend some time at Universal's Citywalk and mall and at night we visited the Grauman Theatre. Impressive but not exciting. The next day we spent on a drive through Griffith Park and checked out the Observatory. Need at least 1/2 a day on this activity. We were closest to the Hollywood sign and it is very visible. The view from the Observatory is incredible. Spent the night roaming the streets of LA and souvenir shopping. The only negative about Rodeway Inn. It says continental breakfast.... 2 cereals, milk, juice, a cellowrapped muffins and donuts :( And too soon and our trip ended....", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vienna, Austria", "Title": "\u201cGood location, ants in the room\u201d", "Author": "MikeR1989", "ReviewID": "UR125668399", "Content": "First of all, the location of this motel is great!

Parking was available as soon as we drove in. There was about 4 vacant spaces and parking was free of charge (great!). The location is excellent. It is basically 1 block south of Hollywood Boulevard \"walk of fame\" and the theatres. This was great for us as it was in easy reach and a little quieter to stay at away from all people traffic of Hollywood Boulevard. There are some handy eateries very near by this hotel too. iHop and Mel's Drive-in Diner were great for breakfast and there is a handy In-N-out Burger across the street as well as a Pinkberry frozen yogurt a little further down the street. We arrived late at about 21:30 after a long drive. The check in staff were friendly, polite and prompt. They issued us with the electronic chip-type keys and explained the usual checkout and breakfast times. Our room (214) was on floor 2 with the usual open motel-style hallway. The 2 beds were very conformable, if not a little small for double beds. The room was a nice size for the 3 of us and very clean and tidy. There was great free Wi-Fi and an average CRT TV with some cable channels, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t use it for much other than news/weather. The whole hotel and site looked like it had recently had a very good renovation, everywhere was spotless and decor was smart and tidy. The bathroom was very clean and smelt fresh. Free toiletries were also provided. The pressure of the shower could've been a little better. The in-room wall-mounted AC unit was a bit noisy and not too effective. There was a fairly small swimming pool in a fenced off area of the courtyard next to the car park. The pool water was clean and there were some patio chairs and shade on the poolside area. Great to chill out in after a long day looking round Hollywood. A complimentary breakfast was laid out in reception each morning 7am-9am. It was very handy to grab & go and included items such as cereals, apples, bananas, orange juice, fresh milk, fresh brewed coffee, cookies, croissants and a donut selection. It was handy to have first thing before heading out although I would advise collecting your breakfast early as it is pretty cleared out by 9am! To summarise it was a great value stay in a clean, comfortable and convenient hotel.

However, the next day, it was a different man on reception who was very helpful and gave us a list of bars/restaurants to go to and he also had very good local knowledge and warned us of bad areas to avoid. The room was clean and spacious and the air-conditioning worked fine. The only thing I found strange was having the wash basins outside the bathroom in the bedroom part, but it wasn't a problem, just felt a little weird lol. This hotel is in a very good location, about a 5 minute walk to Hollywood Boulevard where you will find the Walk of Fame, Chinese Theatre, Mini-supermarkets, Souvenir shops, Hooters and other bars and restaurants. It is however, quite a distance from the main bars on Sunset Strip and you will need a taxi as we found out the first night. We started walking and after 45mins, still could see no bars, so we flagged down a taxi and it still took an extra 10mins by car. (be prepared, taxi's are not easily available). There was a small swimming pool, but it didn't look very well maintained and I wouldn't risk going for a swim, however, we did see a couple of people using it.

The location is great, although somewhat shady at nightfall. The inn looks like the sort of establishment a secondhand car dealer would bring a prostitute to on his lunch break. The thick pane of glass between guests and staff in the office was unnerving, and indicative of the safety of the area. At first glance, our room appeared clean. The television had poor reception (although this isn't a huge issue) and there were fridge and microwave facilities. The room certainly wasn't anything fancy, but was definitely adequate for the price. I was feeling very pleased with our decision in the morning, when we noticed something crawling across the bed. Upon closer inspection (and comparison with images on the internet) we discovered it was an adult bedbug. I caught the bug, and brought it down to the office in a cup. The guy in the office wasn't apologetic, but was fairly compliant in allowing us to check out early. I was assured I would receive a refund, and was told to go a couple of inns down the road to the comfort inn where they would 'look after' us. The guy behind the desk there was rude, and refused to look after our baggage while we returned the hire car. We have been pedantically careful about bedbugs, and fortunately had kept all our luggage zipped up on the tiled area. Irrespective of this, the next 24 hours (at least) was spent washing all of our clothes, and wiping down and brushing all our baggage. I realise that tourists bring in bedbugs, and this is not the hotel's fault. But the way in which the establishment deals with the infestation indicates whether the establishment is negligent or not. After checking in to another hotel (dont worry..we left our baggage outside, and cleaned all of it thoroughly!!) it took multiple phonecalls to negotiate a refund as the manager was never there. The woman I spoke to was very unapologetic, and told me they had 'inspected the room and found nothing'. I felt as though she was implying that I had fabricated the entire issue, and that they had no intention of treating the room. I dread to think of how many people's luggage could potentially become infested. I have since received a refund, although it is clear i will not be refunded for the night i stayed.

It is located right on Sunset Blvd which is a very busy street 24 hours/day and the parking lot is cramped (they actually repainted the parking spot lines so that more cars could be cramped in and I was constantly worried that someone would knock the mirror off my car at night although that never happened). This is definitely not frequented by business people (I saw mostly construction workers and young tourists). When I checked in wearing my business suit, carrying my laptop, and asking for a quiet room, the guy at the front desk felt so badly for me that he gave me the keys to both of the available rooms and told me to see which one was quieter and whether \"the toilet works.\" That was nice of him but says a lot about the motel. The rooms smell like sewage, the bath tub and toilet were scratched up, and there was obvious dirt (even a footprint) on my bedsheets. There was a burn mark on the carpet in the shape of an iron and the furniture was filthy. This was when I almost left. But since it was late at night and I had an early interview the next morning, I stayed. The neighborhood is moderately safe (I felt ok as a solo female walking across the street to get a sandwich but I wouldn't go much farther than that) and, amazingly, you don't hear much street noise once you close the door and turn on the fan. I also went out and bought an air freshner to disguise the sewage smell. The free WiFi is pretty fast and I actually slept well all 3 nights there (despite sleeping fully dressed because I didn't trust the dirty sheets). Continental breakfast consists of doughnuts and coffee ONLY. Overall, I feel like I was lucky to have slept well at that place but I certainly would not stay there again. There's a Days Inn right across the street that looks a lot more acceptable.", "Date": "February 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville", "Title": "\u201cThis place rocks!\u201d", "Author": "JohnnyTheWanderer", "ReviewID": "UR13077685", "Content": "Wow, this place is great for what it is.
