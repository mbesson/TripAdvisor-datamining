It was a thoughtfully designed hotel with an excellent restaurant. Each floor is designed by a different group of designers and the feel was extremely trendy. We stayed in the whimsical loft room, which was designed a bit like a tree house in a forest. There is a nespresso machine and very nice toiletries. The only reason why I do not award it full points is because trendiness slightly prioritises practicality. For example, there is absolutely nowhere to hang your wet towel after a shower, and there is hardly any space around the sink to stand a pot of cream. The air conditioner worked well, but I personally don't like being in a room where there is no option to open the window even a crack. It just feels a bit claustrophobic to me. This really is a a great place to stay and I would certainly go back. The staff were unfailingly helpful and the location, while perhaps not to everyone's taste, really suited me. Stay, but for a few days not an extended period, by then the lack of surfaces and airlessness might start to be annoying.

The rooms are tiny but from what I understand, that is standard for Singapore. They provide Kiehl's toiletries and even an Iphone dock. The breakfast is included and is fantastic. My only gripe is that our room (207) was right over a cafe that is open until 3 am, and it was pretty loud. When I asked to be switched, the front desk said that they didn't have any other \"rooms of our type\" available. It might have been lost in translation, but in the US, a hotel would normally switch you to any available room if you are having noise problems, not just another room of the same type.

We chose one of the Loft rooms. the lower level of the room was huge and it's an open concept with no segregation of the toilet and the rest of the room. One suggestion though would be to move the TV so that we can have a better view while relaxing in the tub. the toiletries provided were from Kiehl's so that's even more of a plus. The upstairs area was much smaller - just a queen size bed and a much smaller tv but nonetheless a cosy area for a weekend away from the city.

Good breakfast though some choice is not good and milk is not very fresh which make me fart. I never had this problem at Hilton though their price is different. 2. Big brand bath supplies: Kiehl's. This is better than those customization shampoos.. 3. Nespresso. You did not get it wrong, it is Nespresso, not some instant coffee. 4. Complimentary mini bar drinks, though only coke and orange/apple juice available. Still very good. 5. Enough fresh air supplies. Most aircon room dont have enough fresh air supplies from outside since heat/cool the air costs more power. The recycled air could make people uncomfortable, for example, do not sleep well. I dont like: 1. too small room, then no desk no storage place..... 2. Outside hotel is a little messy. 3. Jacuzzi place is closed at 9:00pm and not allow to sit there even you dont want get into the water. It is a little bad since this place is the only open area you could laid down and look at the sky.

The noise outside was loud, but it wasn't the hotel's fault. This hotel is located in Little India, which is within walk-distance from Bugis MRT (closer to Little India) from the airport, but it was rather confusing to find due to the constructions around the area (some paths were blocked / closed). What disappoints me the most is probably the fact that they provide only wifi for one device, luckily it was easy to overcome this problem. I mean, nowadays people have two or more devices, especially if there are two people staying - I don't see the problem of giving more people internet access when Singapore is supposed to be \"high-tech\" and all.

We chose this boutique hotel because of its unique theme that stands out from other boutique hotels in Singapore. We had pre-arranged an early check-in with the Marcom Mgr for our photoshoot and she was extremely accommodating to our request. Upon arrival at the hotel, check-in was pretty swift and the reception staff were very friendly. The Marcom Mgr even came to our room to greet us to ensure that everything is attended to. The lift to the rooms is located just beside the reception counter. You need to scan your room key (access card) in order to operate the lift - an appreciated security measure by the hotel. The Whimsical Lofts are on the highest level (level 4) of the building, the other rooms are located on levels 2 & 3. You will be pleased to know that WIFI, drinks, tea and Nespresso are complimentary. A staff also brought up a complimentary bottle of wine for us. The loft is also equipped with 2 TVs (lower & upper level), 2 phones (lower & upper level), an electric kettle, an iPod dock and a safe. The loft has a bathtub, rain shower and 2 wash basins. The hotel also provides shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion from Kiehl's. You need to climb the stairs to get to the king-sized bed and the steps are quite small so be careful. Next to the bed, you will find a lamp and dimmer switch for the lights in the room. The thing that got to me was the rather poor sound-proofing of the rooms. We could hear people talking and doors closing along the corridor which can be quite irritating in the night. You must try the food at Cocotte - the hotel's restaurant. Do make reservations because it is very popular. I would recommend their Basque Squid (a spicy squid stew) and their Roast Pork Collar - really awesome stuff! We had complimentary breakfast the next morning which was pretty good as well. There is also a buffet table filled with bread and a variety of cereal. Upon checking-out, the reception staff asked if we still wanted the complimentary bottle of wine which was very thoughtful. If you drive, public car park lots are rather limited at the front of the hotel. You may have to park your vehicle about 100 metres away from the hotel if you cannot find a lot in front of the hotel.

I was put on hold as the receptionist contacted Sales staff, but was subsequently informed that none were available. The front desk staff were helpful and did locate a room at another hotel, but as this room was purchased through Agoda there was no option for refund without a lot of hassle and I opted to stay as I had to get on with the urgent work. I therefore had no option but to sit propped up on the bed with the laptop on a pillow. The noise of talking and laughter from the coffee shop next to the hotel went late into the night (the management acknowledge this and provide ear protectors). At 3 in the morning, and having slept badly, I went to 7-11 to get a snack and saw that one of the overnight hotel staff sitting in the coffee shop talking animatedly with another person.

The best plan was to nip up to the room and bring down another espresso. I had one dinner in the restaurant: excellent but far from cheap. The position is good - given the price of the room.

The staff were really good and had great uniforms! Not so great aspects - the room would be impossible to air, with no opening windows and being in the centre of the hotel. This means it smells dank, had mould visible in the shower and I have to admit, the smell turned my stomach a little. The room is compact but adequate - the bed is built into a step up floor, and the shower and toilet were in cubicles with a sink in between. It's a good 10 minute walk through the various hindu gods lining the streets in little India to take you to MRT. However, you're close to Sim Lim tower if you want some electronics, and there is a really good, cheap Thai place literally next door. We ate at the in-house French restaurant. I would say the mushroom truffle soup was extraordinary. Everything else expensive/average. I think we got a pretty good deal on our rooms.

Just outside of our room, there was the hotel's tiny jacuzzi which we didn't make time to us.

Also, the flush was too weak, we had to always press and hold for many seconds before it 'worked its wonder'. Pillows were a tad too soft, gave us stiff necks and shoulders after. And then, the noise. Could barely sleep through as the doors outside kept slamming shut. That noise was just way too loud, not a good point.

Not your typical hotel, but more a \u2018design boutique\u2019 hotel that teeters more towards the quirky rather than the luxe.

But on a personal level, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Wanderlust Lust. I always like to start with the bad stuff: 1.Was slightly noisy during the day, as it seems that there was some drilling work nearly going on. But it was not such a disruptive decibel that you cannot fall asleep. But just to note for people who may be noise sensitive (but to begin with, if you don\u2019t like the hussle and bussle of little Indian you shouldn\u2019t be staying there). 2.Thin walls along the corridor. You can sometime hear people talking\u2026 but that doesn\u2019t not happen regularly. 3.Variety of breakfast spread is limited though it is a buffet The good stuff: 1.Complimentary room upgrade! 2.Complimentary mini fridge with water, softdrinks and juices restocked daily (not too sure if this came with the room upgrade\u2026) 3.Free internet wifi access 4.Complimentary daily news papers 5.Free toiletries and lotion from Kiehl 6. Nespresso coffee in the room 7.Daily breakfast though is limited, but it is quality and not quantity that counts; and this does have the quanlity.

There is a jacuzzi for the hotel guests to use but when we arrived in was under maintenance and then after that was finished, it was just cold, so that was disappointing.

We asked to move to a second room which was less noisy. It wasn't at all less noisy, there was still the noise from the alleyway adn to make matters worse, there were renovations going on in the room above us and we had to put up with drilling and sanding noises for a couple of hours, until we called the front desk and asked that it stop. The restaurant that is in the lobby also starts playing music at about 8am, and this woke us up as well.

A great little coffee maker for coffee drinkers like myself who like real coffee.
