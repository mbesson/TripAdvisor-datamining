My section which probably had 20-30 rooms only had ONE bathroom, which was coed. So basically I would be shaving, while some German girl was fixing her hair next to me, while some weird old man in tidy-whities came in to take a dump, all in not a very large space. Weird! The bathroom was well-maintained, but couldn't we at least have separate men's and women's bathrooms!? That is too Euro-trashy for my taste.

I stay in all sorts of places and don't mind spending money when I get the utility (I flew BA Club Class this trip to NYC) but I don't like spending money on a large room in NYC that I'll just sleep in. The Jane is nearly perfect in this regard. It was cheap for NYC (I paid $100 a night) which compares to The Pod Hotel I've stayed in before and even run-down flea pits like The Larchmont. Bearing in mind the new Yotel here is about $300 a night and The Jane is a bargain. But you get what you pay for. The single room is tiny as everyone on here notes so I wasn't surprised. But there was enough storage space above and below the bed to keep my stuff out of the way. I couldn't work out what was original and what was new in the room. They've been very well renovated down to the fake faded carpet that looks old but cannot be. The free wifi throughout the hotel was strong and fast. The staff are great. The bar, lounge and cafe are like stepping back into another era. In a good way. Negatives: arriving at 12.30am I needed my sleep and the two girls in the next room came back at 2am and were laughing and talking until 4am. The soundproofing isn't great. Next time, I'd call reception. Ignorant cows. The bar prices are surprisingly high for a hotel that charges $100 a night. $14 for a mojito is higher end bar prices. The prices fit the bar ambiance not the hotel's positioning. I would have preferred a small wash basin in the room (you get one in The Pod Hotel) and the room got quite hot at night and the fan is too noisy to have on when trying to sleep. I don't mind shared bathrooms (they were always clean and curiously empty when I needed to use them) and you're provided with slippers and a robe for the thrilling journey down the corridor. The rest of the guests seemed to be youngish and fashionable rather than entry-level bargain seekers.

Staying in Queens, NJ, and also in the city. Out of all the places I've stayed, I loved this location the best. I'm not into Times Square and the crowds, I like off the beaten path and this is it. An easy walk to The West Village, Washington Sq., Bleeker St, Houston St., Soho, and Canal St. Keep in mind, easy for me = interesting, which could be at least a 1/2 hour walk. But that's what I go to the city for...to EXPLORE! We stayed in a twin bunk cabin with a communal bathroom which was a first for me. Hey, gotta try everything at least once! The actual bedroom is SO tiny. There really isn't ANY floor space for 2 people to put their things AND get changed. I will not suggest this room if you're staying for any length of time since there is no place to put anything other than the 2 drawers under the bottom twin bed. Your suitcases will take up what little floor space there is. We stayed one night which was enough for me in such a small room. The room got VERY hot at night. The heat is not regulated room by room but set on a main thermostat. We had to leave our window opened a crack but then in the middle of the night we were cold. The lighting in the room is VERY dim. Not bright enough to put makeup on and know what it's actually going to look like outside. The bathroom lighting is a tad brighter at night, but still, not at the best angle to apply makeup.They should add a couple of lighted makeup mirrors in the bathrooms for accuracy! For a one night stay...the lighting and the tiny room was tolerable. The bathroom is VERY spacious...the actual toilet doors run from floor to ceiling so you have complete privacy as are the shower units themselves. There were 2 toilets and 2 showers in the bathroom at the end of our hall. The shower area is huge...big enough to bring all your things into the actual shower stall. Have to figure out how to keep the stuff dry though. Even though the shower head runs straight down, mist will get on your clothes so be careful. What makes up for the dim small room is the decor of the building and location! VERY cool. If you like history, and old time ambiance...this is the place. The restaurant just off the lobby was delicious for breakfast...try the avocado toast...very yummy.

Then we found that proverbial needle in a haystack -- an actual bargain. Not just cheap. Dirt cheap! The Jane. Only 99 bucks a night. OK, as they say, you get what you pay for, and here's what we were paying for: a teensy-weensy room (and I use the word \"room\" loosely; you'd be better off thinking \"closet\"), equipped with bunk beds...and not much else. You use a shared bathroom down the hall. My husband and I are not young. Far from. Nor are we hipsters, like the enormous crowd of attractive, 20-something club-goers we had to wade through late Saturday night just to get inside the front door. Also,once inside, we discovered one reason why the hotel might bear its name -- the elevators and hallways have a distinct scent of something once known as Mary-Jane. The room (by which I mean closet, although maybe you should forget closets, since it has none) brought to mind the efficiently designed compartments you find on overnight trains. It was only as long as its two stacked twin-sized beds (just over 6 feet) and offered less than 3 feet of space between the beds and the wall. Then again, if you don't bring much luggage, how much space do you need? The beds were comfortable, and each was equipped with its own flat-screen TV, giving it the feel of an airplane seat. As for those public bathrooms, there are two on each hallway with ultramodern fixtures offering two toilets, two sinks and two shower compartments with doors. All bathrooms are unisex, and you will find yourself getting very intimate with strangers very quickly. Then again, uou use public restrooms when you're in a restaurant, mall or a plane. Why not a hotel? One morning, my husband was shaving when a woman stepped out of the shower with a towel on her head and another draped around her shoulders. Nothing below the waist. \"Morning,\" she said nonchalantly. Made his day. OK, so it wasn't the most elegant hotel experience we've ever had. Maybe it was the least.

I was wrong. In college, I lived in the dorms and, At the time, it seemed like glamorous fun to share a 150 square foot room with another person, and share bathrooms down the hall with everyone on my floor. In retrospect? It sucked. To compare, this is even worse. The Bed: at 5'6 I reach the end of the mattress when I lie down. This means that my feet are practically in the shelves at the end of the bed. Also, the matress thickness is about that of a cot. Not comfortable. I suppose they try to balance this by having feather pillows and high threadcount sheets but it just seems a pittance. The noises: You can hear everything. Your next door neighbors telephone conversations, music, and tv. You can even hear sounds from the bathrooms all the way down the hall (I was about 14 doors down and could hear flushing). The light: There are two lights in this small abode, one above with a yellow wash/low wattage, and one over the bed. Turning both on together did not make it bright enough to do my makeup in the room and the yellowness of the lights made it feel like I was in some low budget horror movie. Little whines: I couldn't get the internet on my ipad to work, it required flash and java which ipads don't have. WTG Jane. My key was touch and go, if you held it just the right way and twisted left it worked. They require that you put your key in the wall to get elecrticity to work. This means when gone I can't charge cameras, laptops or phones. There is one window which directly faces another window. It's chest high which means that I kept it closed 100% of the time. For a room that small, the window would have been nice. The one time I went into the bathroom the floor was sopping wet, the counters were sopping wet, and the seat was up. Just gross. I checked in at 2pm and by 7pm I had decided that this room was more like a jail cell than a hotel room. For someone who does not get clostrophobic, I started to feel antsy and uncomfortable in the room. While in pictures the wood siding and red decor looked cute and quaint, in person it just felt heavy and made the room seem smaller than it was. 7:30pm hit and I had booked myself another room for the next two days confirming that the extra 50.00 a night I'm spending at Hotel Metro is more than worth it.

However, at best, it will cost you $400 a night and it does not seem worth it at all. Especially when you consider this: starting at around 10 PM (on weekends at least) loud music cranks up (specifically The Pony by Ginuine over and over again) with amplified bass and it is super loud, I can sleep through anything, but not this. During our stay, around 2 AM when this was still going on I called downstairs and the person at the desk - who seemed to be very used to getting calls about the noise levels - said that the music should stop around 3 AM and that he would ask them to turn down the bass. There was never a change in volume or bass level that I could tell and the music ended around 4 AM. It is a full on dance party - not a bar or even a music venue - a high bass, non-stop, high volume, dance party - as if you have stepped into a bad Britney Spears non-stop remix. The lower level floors are absolutely intolerable, not exaggerating, higher floors might be better, but even the higher level floors that look out into the courtyard, where music is also going, are probably effected, though perhaps not as much. The lack of sleep really did ruin the trip as our plan was to do stuff mostly during the day - hoping to get to sleep at least by 1 AM. Also while the fixtures and furnishing in the hotel are cute if you look closely they are not antique, but are mostly reproductions which makes things very Disney Landish/Anthropolgiesh - a bit phoney, for those who care about such. Mostly the experience felt more worth $200 or so New York dollars - not the double amount of $400! I wish the hotel would at least warn people that there is a full on dance party going on during the weekends and that volume is loud until 4 AM or so, this would allow people to plan and book accordingly. Now that the Chelsea is gone it is difficult to find a cute, historic, unique, reasonable hotel in New York and I do not have any suggestions for such, but I can say they were very nice at the Warwick and rates were under $200 and the Standard in Brooklyn, albeit totally different might be another thought. Also room service is horrible do not order it - the food is good, but everything arrives in to-go containers, it is more like a fast food in a meal situation than a room service presentation - walk down and get it to go and save some money on delivery if you want something in your room. Rooms and hallways are a little dark too, not a bother to me, but if you are looking for a bright, sunshine type situation this is not it.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Namur, Namur, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, pleasant staff, but...\u201d", "Author": "Sandra S", "ReviewID": "UR122259027", "Content": "Great location,very calm,polite staff and excellent cafe.

We had originally booked 2 nights but our trip got cut short after I got eaten alive by bedbugs in 2 of the rooms. After discovering bites around 2 a.m., I got suspicious and googled \"bedbugs jane hotel\" on my phone and found this: http://bedbugregistry.com/location/NY/10014-1700/New-York/113-Jane-St/. I called the front desk and told them that I was getting bitten and asked if we could switch rooms. I wanted to leave but since it was the middle of the night I figured we could try another room. The concierge asked if I had seen any actual bugs and I said no. They said they would move us but to wait on the bellhop because there was a \"process\". The bellhop finally showed up after I called twice and in the meantime we had trapped a bug I saw crawling on my sheets under an empty water glass as evidence. He told us he was going to have to take all of our stuff and steam it and they would return it in the morning. After moving rooms and finally dozing off to sleep, I awoke around 6 a.m. to more bites that were itching like crazy and switched on the light to see another bug crawling across the sheets. At that point I had had enough and called down to the front desk and asked them to bring us our stuff and told them we were checking out immediately. The bellhop brought up our stuff and it was bagged in trashbags and some of it was still damp. We got dressed in the bathroom because we didn't want to run the risk of any bugs getting in our stuff that had just been treated. We checked out and the concierge comped our room without us having to ask but didn't apologize, although I will say to their credit the staff was very polite and helpful throughout the whole ordeal. It's really a shame this is such a problem because the hotel is so cute with so much history and in a great neighborhood for a great price. I've been to the ballroom several times and threw a friend a baby shower in the restaurant last month and had great experiences each time. As a New Yorker, I know how much of an issue bedbugs are in this city, but it is appalling that the hotel knows that this has been a problem for years and continues to rent out the infested rooms night after night. I found one bug on my toilet that must have traveled home with me in my underwear (I hope it was the only one!), have some bites that swelled up to welts the size of baseballs, and am still itching days later.

First of all, my room was $325 a night, not including tax, which seemed very steep, even for NYC. My room was tiny, with about 2 1/2 feet of space between the bed and the walls. The bathroom was a nice size, however. The hotel staff was generally very pleasant and helpful. The hotel is located on the west side highway, so I can only imagine how loud the rooms are on this side of the hotel. When I checked in I asked for a quiet room and was told that my room faced Jane Street, so it would probably be not be too loud. What the front desk attendant didn't mention was the super loud club that operates in the hotel seven nights a week. I was in room 215 and it was so loud as to be unpleasant and I'm sure a light sleeper would have been driven insane by the music. Another complaint is that apparently the heating system dates from the time the hotel was originally built and it turned my room into a sauna - I was told by a staff member that the heat cannot be turned down because it is an old system. So, every time I returned to my room it was about 100 degrees F (37 degrees C). The only option was to open the window (which also lets in street noise) or to run the air conditioner for a few hours until the temperature is brought under control. Now for the good stuff. The hotel is located adjacent to the West Village which is a totally awesome neighborhood with cafes, bars, restaurants, the new highline park, and the chelsea market nearby.

We didn't mind the single-sex washrooms either, they did not smell, were not dirty, and extremely well maintained. We appreciated the quiet area of the neighbourhood, not sketchy, and although I had been expecting it to be noisy from some reviews about it being a clubby area, we were on the 4th floor, and were not disturbed at all from any disturbances! So if you are a budget traveller who does not mind a couple of nights in a small room, do check this out as your place to stay in NYC!", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cQuirky\u201d", "Author": "Catherine T", "ReviewID": "UR119583631", "Content": "We stayed in a captains room while not large it was comfortable with a nice bathroom.The cafe had a good selection for breakfast and the evening meal we had was very good ,but make sure you leave the right tip,we got our sums wrong and felt very embarrassed to be told so on leaving!!Very near to the high-line walkway a must see,right on the river so some lovely walks.I would stay here again.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "olympia washington", "Title": "\u201cTiny rooms, tiny price\u201d", "Author": "dottravels", "ReviewID": "UR119411633", "Content": "Feels like you're on a ship - narrow halls, tiny rooms, great front desk.

I would definitely recommend this hotel if there were not for two things, bed bugs and a very noisy air condition. First the rooms are very small but they their job very good. They are practical and comfortable even if they are very tiny. The shared bath rooms worked very well and were always clean. Only at one occasion I had to wait otherwise there was always a free toilet or shower when I need one. The small room and the common bath rooms are compensated by the lower price compared too many NYC hotels. Personally I rather spend my money in nice restaurant, bar or go shopping. The location in West Village and Meat Packing District is very good and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a short walk to the subway on 14th St and 8 Ave. There are a lot of nice restaurants and bars on walking distance. It only takes some 15-20 minutes to walk to Chelsea, Greenwich Village and Soho. Setback no 1: There were bed bugs in the room and I got bitten on several places on the body. After I left the hotel the bite marks went away after a week but they were itching quite a lot in the beginning. Setback no 2: The air condition was extremely NOISY. It was impossible to sleep with air con switched on and as the rooms are very small they get very warm and I had difficulties to sleep some the nights, especially when it was warm outside. I complained at the front desk and they sent a guy to fix it but there was no improvement. If it not was for these 2 setbacks I would definitely recommend the hotel for someone who is looking for nice hotel at good price.

The number of the room was not on the key so it got a bit confusing when we got the room number wrong. We got to the room and could not believe how small it was! There was the two bunk beds and then about a foot of space in between the beds and the wall/mirror. Therefore we couldn't get dressed at the same time. Have to say though, this made the last day easier as we had to keep our suitcases packed the whole time! I was aware it would be shared bathrooms before going so that was not an issue. But I was glad that I never had to wait for a toilet or a shower which was really good. The beds are pretty comfy, the hotel is pretty quiet and there was a tv that each bed could see but ran by one remote. Beds are made every day and new towels provided daily. Also you are provided with a bathrobe and slippers. Showers are fitted with shampoo/conditioner/shower gel dispensers and the bathrooms have hairdryers fitted. On our last day the hotel staff were super friendly and kept our luggage for the day and booked us a taxi to the airport.

The room is very small (cruise ship like) but I wasn't in there much and I would work in the bistro downstairs anyway. NOT a fan of shared bathrooms but they were extremely clean - initially I was uncomfortable but then realized that everyone was in the same situation. I did have a neighbor who lived in the hotel permanently (and has been there for years) - he hung out in the hall way all the time but was very cordial and entertaining. He advised me that one of the floors had a better shower since our floor was crowded... I am sure many people would find him odd but I loved seeing him every time I left my room lol Overall, the hotel is not for everyone and for $99-$125 this is a bargain given the location, staff, cleanliness and amenities.

I was given room 537A which is a corner room with great views of The Hudson River and Statue of Liberty. The room was small but it's nothing new to me and I loved that I get a little breeze coming in since it was a bit warm. You also get a view of a busy highway and can hear cars going by night and day, which is also not a problem with me since I'm not a light sleeper. What I have a problem with on this trip however is the cleanliness of my room and the shared bathrooms down the hall. To be fair, this is my second time at The Jane, so what I had encountered here are nothing new. My room gets a lot of visits from pigeons and they do a lot of things by my window. They eat, sleep and of course relieved themselves. There were plenty of pigeons' droppings right by my window and as far as I can see they're not new, which led me to believe that all these droppings have accumulated over a long period of time. What also happened was some of the feathers flew into and got stuck on my screen. After all this I couldnt helped but think what kind of air have I been breathing into my lungs or should I be worried about bird flu? The next problem is the shared bathrooms. Most of the time they were clean and I know housekeepers have been doing their job since I've seen them cleaning many times. However at a certain time when I come in, there seems to be a leak which I'm not sure it's coming from the sinks or from the showers. What I also discovered on my last morining was a few red bums on my arm which possibly have resulted from bed bugs. I did not look around to confirm my suspicions since I had to get ready to check out. Room 537A might be an isolated incident but it's definitely worth the attention of housekeeping and maintenance staffs. As you can see I have nothing but the best things to say about this hotel on my first stay. A lot of things went wrong on my second time here and they need to be fixed. On a higher note, I lost my wallet on the way to the hotel and the front desk staffs helped me in every way they can with check-in in regards to room charges and incidental deposit, which I greatly appreciated.

I was at the fifth floor, no noise nor from the large street beneath river Hudson nor from the bar at the ground floor. Rooms are tidy with the bed done every day and towels changed every day. Toilets and showers always clean and not busy. Staff was enormously nice and helpful. The must are location in Meatpacking, the coolest quarter of NYC, full as it is of fancy restaurants and bars, very close to glamour High Line, packed with restored industrial properties , now totally gentrified. five minutes walk from Chelsea Market, an amazing attraction, and opposite River Hudson Park with its faboulous running path and breathless view over lower Manhattan, the river and New jersey skyline, 10 minutes walk from Green Village and clubs as the stunning and unique Blue Note. Never listened to such heavenly jazz music, believe me. Fantastic. Breakfast at Caf\u00c3\u00a8 Gitane with models being pictured for Vogue is a lovely experience. The must is free bikes you have to return within 7 pm but for me a very comfortable plus to visit the city, moving beetween museums, central park (biking there is a real funny experience) and restaurants and bars.

They are very spacious but he don't tells they are too overpriced. Air conditioning is too old and noisy and if you want to sleep you have to switch it off. You can't leave it on when you're out as they work only with the key room being put into the wall.

This means even less manoeuvring. Here's a tip: swivel the mattress 180 degress. Why? The lip of the mattress has likely been compressed and as a result the mattress \"angles\" toward the edge. With the more stable lip of the mattress that has been facing the wall now turned to the bed's edge, you won't angle off toward the edge. AND you can then move the mattress about a handwith away from the wall without fear of falling over as that stable lip doesn't hand down. This made all the difference in the world for my sleeping, that little bit of extra room. 2) Quiet: I've read some reviews talking about noise. I had a room on the 6th floor. Perfectly quiet. Great a/c. 3) Showers: the washrooms are very clean, and they give you poly/cotton slippers. What you really need are cheap rubber/plastic slip-ons or flip-flops, as you would with any public shower/bathroom. Spend the $2 to pick up a pair at your local dollar store. 4) The restaurant: gross. Overpriced (like any hotel resto, granted) but unbearably bad faux-french cuisine. There are better places around the corner. Otherwise, the staff is great and the place is compact and clean. If you are not the type who is often in your room, then the value and location are superb.", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cHome away from home!\u201d", "Author": "carolmonsantos", "ReviewID": "UR116799489", "Content": "For the second time visiting NYC, I stayed at the Jane for 4 WEEKS! Yes, you read me right. A full month. As you can imagine, I really got to know the hotel, its pros and cons. And I can tell you it was just great. The vibe of the hotel is super cool, with really nice decoration, it feels very comfortable. I had breakfast at the hotel's bar Gitane almost everyday and it was great, not only a cool place with a great vibe, cool music and decoration, but also great food at an affordable price. I also had lunch and dinner a couple of times there and it was really good. Tip: do try the cous-cous (great!) and be careful with the meatballs, they are very spicy! The service at the bar was perfectly normal and within a few days people got to know me and were really extremely nice to me. I have no complaints about it. Regarding the room, I stayed at a Captains Cabin and I really liked it. Of course it's not a big room, but it was definitely big enough for me and my boyfriend, who stayed with me for a couple of weeks. I even had to work almost every day and the desk provided had enough room for everything. The AC worked properly every day, which was convenient since the temperatures in June were around 100.F (something like 42.\u00c2\u00baC). My room had a view of the river and on two different nights I watched the fireworks from my room, which was amazing! The window are not too big, though. I still liked it. The bathroom was great, and the cleaning service was ok, although I would have to ask to get fresh sheets, because after 2 weeks they didn't change them. When I asked for fresh ones, the immediately changed them, so no problem there either. Everyday they get you a bottle with fresh water (for free), which is a nice touch, as well as the robe and the flip.flops. The wi.fi works great and there were only two ot three times when the servers were down but that only lasted some minutes, and they would get it starting back right away. It was fast and easy to connect. I really liked the hotel staff, who were all very chilled, very nice and helpful and after a whole month they actually started to feel as friends. The location of the hotel is absolutely amazing. It's next to the Meatpacking District (literally 5 minutes walking) and 15 minutes from a subway. It's a very peaceful neighbourhood, with a fresh breeze from the river. I really, really loved the spot. I had a great time and I look forward to return!!!

One night was spent in a twin(bunk) room with a friend and three were spent in a single. As a bit of a design obsessive I prefer hotels with a bit of character over more clinical/plain hotels, which is why I chose The Jane. Im so glad that I did! The hotel is close to the Metro, about a 5 minute walk, and in the centre of what I was later found is quite a trendy district which includes the High Line. I found the staff at the hotel to be very welcoming, helpful and chatty. Their uniforms are quite special! But they seemed to be enjoying themselves in this quirky enviroment. The rooms are small, but I dont see this as a bad thing and it certainly didnt put me off, the wall to wall mirrors and nice interior design make it seem bigger than it is. The bathrooms are spotless and again, great design! Very vintage. I ordered food one evening (Brie with apple and meatballs) which were both very nice if not a little cold. It was late on an evening and I think the staff were busy with other customers in the cafe so it took a while, I guess this is no excuse but the food still tasted great! The bar is great aswell but the drinks are very expensive, me and my friend had one then went elsewhere. We also tried to move from the bar to the main seating area and were told we couldnt as the waitresses hadnt served us. As a british pub-goer I found this annoying as the big sofa's were calling me! The hotel bar is a popular bar in the area for none patrons, which means at a weekend it gets packed and alot of the partiers hang out outside. This wasnt so pleasant when I had to get my flight at 3am (kicking out time) when I was surrounded by drunk hipsters (ugh). However the staff had me as a priority and made sure everyone got out of the way when my airport transfer arrived. All in all though I will definately be staying at The Jane the next time I hit NY and will be recommending it to any visiting friends. Cheap, individual and chilled.

My boyfriend and I stayed in a double bunk bed room. Each bunk had its own TV, and the room had an ipod dock. I was SUPER paranoid about bed bugs before we came, but a quick inspection upon arrival showed nothing. I cannot imagine that the Jane is turning a blind eye to the bed bug epidemic in New York, especially with all of the bed press they seem to be getting these days. Our stay was very comfortable. Yes, the rooms are small, yes, the hotel is noisy with the hopin' bar down below. But it is still a great deal in New York. The only complaint I really have is the patrons of the bar on the weekends.

Was initially very apprehensive about safety to New York and wanted a convenient, safe, and well priced accommodation. The Jane fitted the bill perfectly! The locality is in the charming and safe West Village, and I felt safe walking alone at 10.30pm from the subway to the hotel. And in fact, at 3am from the nearby Meatpacking district after a night out in town. Subway is located a mere 10minute walk at 8th and 14th, and the walk is perfect for scoping out nice local cafes. The subway gets you to everywhere in Manhattan easily. The trendy clubbing/pub area of Meatpacking district is literally 5 minutes walk from hotel, which is awesome for the high heels and alcohol-wobbles :P I stayed on level 4. Room is small but comfortable for one person with plenty of space for luggage. Serviced everyday and love the bathrobe and slippers provided. No in-room fridge but bottle water provided in a cute jug everyday. Lots of electronic amenities provided, but the free Wi-Fi is definitely the draw card, being fast and reliable! Room has a fan and aircon although these tend to be rather noisy. Free local calls are available from the in-room phone, and this was soo handy for ordering all the (free! new york is amazing) dinner deliveries straight to my room! Shared bathrooms are generally clean, with shampoo, conditioner and shower gel provided. There is hardly ever a queue, and if there is, it's always a short wait. I loved the view of statue of liberty greeting me every morning from the bathroom! Hair dryer is available in the bathroom. The 24 hour staff are all so friendly and helpful. One of the front desk girls even came out clubbing with myself and another girl staying at the hotel! Hotel's cafe is cute in decor but I thought the food was only average. I didn't have the chance to go to the hotel bar, but I heard that it has a nice vibe, although often hired out for private functions. Try to get a room on a higher level so you won't be disturbed by the music from the bar late at night. Only complaints: There are some permanent residents there, and consequently, some of them will smoke in their rooms. On 2 of the 13 nights I stayed, even though my room door was closed, I was nearly choking with the cigarette smoke and had a terrible night's sleep. When I told the front desk, unfortunately they advised me that not much could be done except for the housekeeping staff to air out my room :( It was just lucky that I encountered this problem for only 2 nights, otherwise I would've asked to change rooms. Other complaint is that the walls/doors are not too soundproof so you will hear the neighbour's tv occasionally, and the drunken giggles of people storming down the corridor after returning from late night clubbing. I didn't find it too much of a problem though. Overall: love the decor, history and vibe of the hotel. Friendly and helpful staff overall. Cheapest hotel in a convenient, and safe location in Manhattan. Free reliable wifi. Also, the tv program \"how to make it in America\" was shooting on location at the hotel on one of the days!", "Date": "June 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carmel, Ca", "Title": "\u201cJane is a charming girl\u201d", "Author": "Chiorazzi", "ReviewID": "UR110845801", "Content": "The character of this hotel is undeniable.

I don't mind a shared bath and the bunk bed rooms are tiny(see more about Captains room below), but it's perfect for a solo traveler especially one that has far more planned in NYC than being in a hotel room. The bathrooms are cleaned 24/7. The rooms are pristine. The staff really takes care of the hotel. Free bottled water, free wifi, crisp cotton robes, plentiful towels and slippers in every room. No closet, but plenty of hooks on walls and door and drawers under the bed. I wonder if the bellhop would store your empty suitcase for you to keep it out of the way? It'd be worth asking as the staff is sooooo accommodating. Did I mention free bike rentals? With the trail up and down the Hudson right across the street, this a perfect place to bike to and from. Cafe gitane is on the ground floor. They have wonderful food, coffee to go and a large sunny room in which to lounge and graze. The bar is dark and sexy and a perfect spot for meeting friends. The decor is quirky. Funky taxidermy, glossy tile, dark woods and a high ceilinged lobby. There is gorgeous wall paper in the rooms. Cannot say enough about the staff - they are friendly, warm, responsive, helpful and nice. NOTE: NYC went through a few months of bed bug infestation awhile back and no hotel was spared - from budget hotels to the Waldorf Astoria. The Jane takes this very seriously. They clean, clean, clean to keep bed bugs from getting in. IF you have a problem with bed bugs at the Jane (I had no problem on either trip), the Jane has a procedure for ridding your rooms and belongings of bed bugs. Everyone at the hotel is trained to act immediately should you have a problem here. I merely inquired about it and was immediately reassured. The only way to fight bed bugs is to be diligent and quick and it's obvious that the Jane does it well. I hated to leave the Jane on Thursday. Captains Rooms: On my last stay (May 2010), I upgraded myself from bunk room to Captains room because I had some friends stopping by to visit. Captains rooms are lush. Funky, comfy furniture, Hudson Rive views and great bath products in the huge en suite bath. There is a big armoire for storage and a small fridge.

Long mirror with hooks to hang things up on opposite the bed. Theres also an ipod dock and flat screen tv. and the free wifi was fast and reliable. So yes, small but quite quirky and i did feel like i was in a ships berth - which was fun. The bathrooms were fine - black and white tiled and generally pretty clean. I liked the pump dispensers in the shower of shower gel, shampoo and conditioner so dont worry about bringing your own. There was a bar, which i looked into one afternoon and it looked pretty cool. Unfortunately the nights I was there was New York Fashion week and it was booked out for private functions. The staff were pretty helpful though about suggesting when to come down to try and get in, but I couldnt be bothered waiting around that much. I found the staff really good. I arrived at 7am, after about 30 hours of travelling (from NZ) and was pleasantly surprised to be able to check in straight away. I showered and went straight to bed for a few hours. I did however wake up to find bites on my legs. Having read all about the bed bug epidemic in New York I rang the front desk who came straight away. They didnt think it was bed bugs - was about 7 different bites, apparently bed bug bites are clustered in groups of 3 - but they took all my stuff away, heat treated it, gave me anti-itch cream, put the stuff i wanted to wear in the dryer for 30 mins (so could have it quicker than the heat treating) and switched my room. I'm still not sure whether it was bed bugs or not - part of me suspects it was, as the first bed didnt have the protective cover zip up mattress protector that the second room had - but the bites did go away pretty quickly and I've had no other issues. I was impressed by how quickly and efficiently they acted, and almost didnt write this as I dont want to put people off. I think in New York what you really want is a place that responds quickly if there are suspected bed bugs, which is what the Jane did. The first room I was briefly in, was on the 3rd floor - at the end of the hallway. The second room was on the 4th floor, in the middle of the hallway. The end rooms are curved, so slightly smaller and being closer to the bathroom meant that it was noisier. 4th floor was very quiet and no problem with neighbours. Location was great. Easy to walk all around Chelsea, its about 2 mins from the HighLine, easy walking distance to West Village / Greenwich etc as well. Metro was about 5-10 mins away. Lots of bars and clubs in the area, and felt safe to walk around at night. I also spent a few nights in the Theatre District - but if you wanted somewhere close to bars / clubs I'd recommend this area more.

Sure, if someone else were paying for my stay or I had all the money in the world I would probably stay at one of the other great hotels in the area, like the Standard or the Gansevoort, or possibly a classic mid-town hotel.

The Jane provides all four. It's about a three minute walk from the trendy Meanpacking District restaurants, where I can justify a breakfast at Pastis with all the money I've saved staying at The Jane. Wireless Internet is free and fast and doesn't require a password. The rooms are spotlessly clean, and the shared bathroom for the cheapest rooms are likewise.

Staff went out of their way to help and even the elevator (which I had heard so much about) had no problems to which I was grateful (and being on the 6th floor that elevator was a lifesaver). My only real issue out of my entire stay was the sound of the heating system which when turned on sounded like a loud woosh coming through the room which woke me up early every morning. From what I was told this is the sound of steam at high pressure coming through the pipes and with the hotel having been built in 1906 this was understandable. Old hotel, has a lot of character, it makes sounds and if you are expecting silence when you come to NYC you choose the wrong place. The Jane sits on a lovely little cobblestone street in the greenwich village and the west side highway, and the neighborhood itself is charming and near the Skyline. Having grown up on a sailboat the size of my room didn't faze me, but if you are expecting to spread out in a basic bunk cabin think again. The room itself was fine for one, and suited my basic needs. I ran around NY most of the time I was there, and came back to the Jane in the evenings to rest up. On the first floor of the hotel is a little french cafe that has the most wonderful waffles. The orange waffle was amazing and I had it twice during my stay. But if the cafe is not for you, there's a shop one block over which is reasonable and has a hot bar so you can pick and choose your food. Also on the first floor or basement (couldn't really tell) is a ballroom which is a lively club.

Lets just say getting to a spacious christian womens hostel in Boston was a relief ... surprising for us too! However, Sunday night the Ballroom is closed so no staying awake til 3-4am ... one night you can sleep. i must say, however, the management responded to my complaint and offered the possibility of moving to a quiet room. We had when booking requested a quiet room and being on the 3rd floor assumed it would be. All in all its fine, cool, quirky but ought to make the guests a priority rather than the club nights.

When I say small, I'm talking 4'X7' max... just enough room for a smaller-than-usual single bed and space to enter. Nevertheless, it's well-designed with a few drawers and space to stash a piece of luggage below the bed and a shelf above the bed (in single rooms) to get other things out of the way. The historic wood paneling adds character, and a wall-size mirror adorns the wall opposite the bed so things aren't too claustrophobic. There is a window, but don't expect much of a view. There is a small flat-screen-TV (it would have to be small and flat!) and the ceiling and reading lights as well as a small fan for air circulation are rheostat-controlled directly above the bed. There is also separately controlled air-conditioning, although I didn't need it in November. The double rooms have bunk-beds in place of the single bed (which I WOULD find claustrophobic), and there are a handful of double-bed rooms with en-suite bathrooms for twice the cost of the majority shared-bath rooms... still a bargain. The basic single rate is $99 before all the NYC taxes... which has to be the best deal in town. Using the standard hotel search engines, I could not find anything else for under $300/night for a popular weekend in any Manhattan location. The compact lobby retains the high ceilings and dark wood paneling of its early days with a wonderfully original elevator that requires an operator. Other amenities include telephone with voice-mail, alarm clock/iPod dock, FREE WIFI and complimentary bicycles! The trendy Cafe Gitane is off the lobby, which I'm told has the best breakfast in town. The shared baths are clean and shiny with black and white tile, but cramped--including one marble sink, two toilet stalls and a one-person shower room. The downside of the shower is that it requires you to hang your towel and whatever you wear to the shower WITHIN the small room, making it very difficult to keep anything dry. They provide tiny bathrobes and disposable slippers, but the bathrobe provided would fit only the tiniest adult I can imagine. (My bathrobe did not extend below my waist!) The most annoying negative of the Jane is the constant sound of closing doors throughout the night (which others have mentioned here), making a sound sleep difficult--unless you can sleep comfortably with ear-plugs... which you MAY have remembered to bring along. The staff were amazingly friendly and helpful--something not all that common in Manhattan, especially at a bargain-rate hotel. Desk staff and porters wear period uniforms with classic pill-box hats, and maids have period costumes as well--actually a nice reinforcement of the historic character of the place. Initially I was skeptical of the location--at the end of Jane Street just this side of the West Side Highway and the river. But it's near the trendy nightlife of the meat-packing district--not of great interest to me, to be honest, but also a short 5-block walk to the 14th Street subway hub, where you can easily reach other parts of the city. I heartily recommend this place... if you are young and desperate for an affordable hotel in NYC. I'm NOT so young and will do my best to pay a little more for more comfort next time.

They make an excellent dry gin martini, and the watermelon mimosa was very good.

They seem to only allow as many people as there are places to sit into the bar, which is wonderful allowing for a relaxed intimate environment, the problem is that they have the music volume set just a bit to high, which makes conversation uncomfortable.

I must admit that I was quite frightened to stay at the Jane after reading some of the reviews. However, I can confirm that I was pleasantly surprised with my stay. Yes, the rooms are microscopic, even for NYC. Nonetheless, they are clean, safe and it really has all that you need. I was skeptical of the shared bathrooms but I also found that these were kept super clean and they were actually pretty nice. My only complaint with The Jane is that I didn't sleep very well. Perhaps, I could blame this on the lights in the room or the sometimes noisy hallways at random hours of the night, or maybe it is because I am a light sleeper. For me, the Jane gets major points for being in the the ABSOLUTE best part of Manhattan. There are so many amazing restaurants and bars nearby, it's adjacent to the Hudson River Park which is great for running. It's also pretty close to ACE and L train which can take you pretty much everywhere. Lastly, the Ballroom at The Jane is one of the best places to go out in the city, granted you probably won't get in unless you are with Mary-Kate Olson. In summary, as a 25 year student, I would totally stay here again for a night or two. Ask me again in a couple of years and I hope to have upgraded to The Standard by then. Just remember that you get what you pay for (so don't expect the Waldorf) but in my opinion and as a former New Yorker, you get a decent amount (in NYC dollars) for your money. PS.

With the money you save at The Jane, you can actually afford the restaurants and clubs in MPD and the West Village! If you're a little worried about the shared bathroom, don't be. Both the showers and toilets are completely enclosed individual \"rooms\" for total privacy. In my experience, the marble sinks have always been clean and well maintained. And rarely do you even encounter another person in the bathroom anyway! The only downside is if you're taking the subway to The Jane, it's a pretty good walk from the nearest stop which is 14th St. and 8 Ave. If you have luggage and you're arriving from JFK on the E train for example, I'd suggest getting a cab for a $5 ride from the stop to the hotel. I've walked it a few times with wheeled luggage and it's a good 10 min walk.

The location is central, convenient, and wonderful on many levels\u00e2\u20ac\u201dJane Street near the Hudson River\u00e2\u20ac\u201das it puts guests in the heart of the West Village, and near the parks that line the river. The now-trendy Meatpacking District is just a few blocks away, the south entrance of the High Line park is close at hand, and the tree-lined residential streets in this part of the Village surround the hotel. The streets appear to be as safe as any in NYC--expensive cars are parked outside, and people stroll at all hours. We were in town for NYC Pride, and Christopher Street is about 10 minutes away. The closest subway station is 8 blocks\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat 14th Street and 8th Avenue--at the south gateway to Chelsea. The 1907 building that once housed The Seaman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Home and a YMCA is a handsome brick structure, and the first floor has considerable architectural charm. . .tapestries, tilework, and interesting lighting. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Gitane is right off the main lobby. The staff wears period hotel costumes, from pillbox hats to French maid uniforms. The Jane ballroom is right off this space--many evenings with a bar scene or private party--an impressive room. To get you to your room, there is a cage elevator and a staircase nearby\u00e2\u20ac\u201dgiven the waits, you may find yourself using the stairs more than you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like. As well, the elevator was out a few times during our five night stay. The hotel rooms are likely the smallest you have ever seen--about a third of the average cruise ship cabin. The two of us stayed in a double bunked room, about 45 square feet (about 8x6) \u00e2\u20ac\u201djust big enough for the two twin bunk beds and room to get into them. No closet, just a rod for hooks, and a mirror the length of the room. There are two drawers under the lower bunk, and a cubby on the top and bottom of the same bunk for storage. Two flat screen TVs\u00e2\u20ac\u201done for each bunk. The detail of the room is very nice\u00e2\u20ac\u201dtin ceilings, nice wallpaper and paint, and good materials. And wifi is free. All the same, you will have to leave the room to change your mind. And we never had our bunks made--not once during our five night stay. In the name of energy efficiency, the key device needs to be inserted into the electricity panel in order to get A/C to work, or to get the lights to work. As a result, the room can take awhile to cool. If the A/C is working for a bit, the room will cool. The bathrooms are down the hall--you are furnished towels and skimpy bathrobes/slippers in your room. The shared bathrooms are, oddly, co-ed (would have preferred a single sex configuration instead) with two shower stalls, and two water closets\u00e2\u20ac\u201dall with lockable doors. Again, the detail is nice, with black & white tile and marble vanity tops. And the showers have rain shower heads\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso the shower is sublime. Shampoo, soap and conditioner are dispensed in the shower stall. While the hotel appears to make an effort to keep the bathrooms clean, sheer volume prevents that at times\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the shower/water closet experience is less favorable\u00e2\u20ac\u201dconsiderably so\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhen things aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t clean. By and large, the staff is pleasant\u00e2\u20ac\u201dat times, very much so\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthough at times, an occasional hipster misplaced in a service role ruins the vibe. Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Gitane, the restaurant in the hotel, looks better than it tastes. Was very disappointed in the breakfast offerings for a restaurant attached to a hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dno brewed coffee in the morning, for example, and a very limited set of breakfast food\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand the tables are close enough to use the salt and pepper shakers of the people sitting next to you. A beautiful room, though--one that likely photographs well. In all, I think The Jane is an acquired taste. It can be perfect for those seeking a great Village location at a low price. If so, you have to determine if you can put up with one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s smallest hotel rooms, and the unique joys of shared baths.

However - the room and bed seemed clean enough, as were the bathrooms (which are indeed coed although the showers and toilets are individual and lock-able), there were lots of (friendly by NYC standards) staff around dressed in 1940's style uniforms, the price is unbelievable (I paid $69+tax), and the place is kind of fun. The rooms are called cabins and look like a ship's cabin with lots of wood, drawers under the bed, and hooks along the wall. (the place was originally built 100 years ago for beached sailors). The restaurant on the first floor, Le Gitane is outstanding.

I was in the larger private room which, after taxes, was about $200 a night, which is not bad for New York -- a city that is pretty much insanely overpriced for most everything involving tourism and entertainment. The staff at the Jane are amazingly friendly -- which I later found to be a trait of everybody in New York. The front desk and bell staff were warm, smiling and helpful. The rooms were also great. Spacious and with this amazing walk-in shower. The feeling is a bit old New York -- it's not bright and glitzy, but very subdued. I loved the decor. Very comfortable bed and an in-room safe that was big enough to even get my laptop in. The free wifi was fast -- although it was down for the first 2 nights due to a technical problem. There's a big flat-screen TV in the rooms, and all kinds of adjustable lighting. I can't comment on the maid service as I didn't use it (trying to be an eco warrior.lol) but my colleague had his room cleaned and said it was OK. If you need it, you need to put a sign outside your door to request it specifically. Finally, the hotel is away from the main streets so it's ultra quiet. I travel with ear plugs, but didn't need to use them. Note that the Jane was renovated not so long ago (not sure when) -- and according to the guys at the front desk, it used to be pretty bad there. So I'd stick to more recent reviews of the Jane when you're trying to decide if it's right for you. And some small points -- the windows in the room open from the top -- you kind of pull it from the top and it pivots on the bottom. I almost took one off the hinge at first trying to open it till I figured it out. Also, they don't make change, so be sure to have a few small bills to tip the bell staff when you get there. To their credit, when we arrived, both my biz partner and I had no small bills -- we apologized and the guys carrying our bags just smiled and of course said it was no problem. We tipped them later in the evening, but it was nice to have that genuine nice attitude from them. Whoever hires for the Jane is doing a great job of it! Although we were working in the day, we explored the city a bit by night, and I took one morning by myself just for sightseeing. It was my first trip to New York, and I was lucky enough to have 18 degree Celsius sunny weather in March. If you're also a first timer, here's some things I did that I'd recommend to anyone staying in NY. 1. Walk a lot. It's a very vertical city, so be sure to look up. The architecture is amazing. We walked from the Jane, which is by the Hudson river near W14th and 9th, all the way up to Madison Square Garden one night, then the next night from the start of Central Park, all through the park, then back through the city from about 82nd, all the way down through Times Square till about 44th. I've never been so happy to get stopped by red lights crossing the street -- more time to just look around and appreciate how utterly cool the city is. 2. The Jane is near (in?) the Meatpacking District, which has an incredible amount of very cool outdoor restaurants and bars. And yes, cool = expensive. But it's a great area to be located. 3. In my morning sightseeing trip, I took a cab down to Battery Park, which is at the southern tip of Manhattan, looking out toward the Statue of Liberty. Everybody told me not to actually go to the Statue as the line ups are endless. So I just took a picture from the park, then headed up for a walk by Trinity Church and into Wall Street. Then I took the subway up to 14th. I'm used to the Tokyo subway system, which is ultra modern -- so the New York one was a bit of an eye opener. It was like something out of the 1940s. But a must-do if you're there. 4. Philly Cheese-steak sandwich. MMmmmmm! Try one, for sure! I had one at the diner near Madison Square Gardens on the corner of W34th and 8th. OK, it's not \"New York food,\" but it was amazing nonetheless. And if you like having a good burger and shake in the park, then hit the \"Shake Shack\" in Madison Square park -- just go to W23rd and 5th Avenue and look for the line up in the park. We waited 45 minutes as it was lunch and the weather was gorgeous. Not the very best burger you'll have, but worth the wait if it's a sunny day in the park. I think that visiting New York at least once in your life is something everybody should do, and the Jane is an amazingly clean, comfortable and well located base to do it. I'd recommend it to anybody.", "Date": "March 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "sao paulo", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay\u201d", "Author": "sampa01425", "ReviewID": "UR59273371", "Content": "My wife and I - mid 30's - stayed in a bunk bed room at the Jane while we had a two day layover in NY.

It sounded too good to be true; a fair price hotel in the West Village, recently opened and nice looking but small rooms. We were able to book a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dccabin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 for two persons for 2 weeks. Arriving at the hotel and seeing our home / cabin for the next two weeks we had the attitude of the positive, still. Okay, it was a very small room with a view on a blind wall and that airco outside was making a lot of noise, but, hey we were in New York. The first night we were completely wasted from the flight from Amsterdam to New York and slept quite early. We woke up in the middle of the night because of the noise coming out of the bar of the hotel downstairs: music, base drums and people in the hallways making a lot of noise. A private party, said the man in the lobby. It was fashion week in New York and it had just begun. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Are there parties every night?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, we asked the next day. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Well, not every night,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd was the answer, but we could be moved to a room with less noise coming in, on the other side of the hallway. So we did. A room with a view this time and no noisy airco outside. From then on things could only be better. Did it make any difference changing the rooms? Well maybe a little bit but even trying to sleep with earplugs in, didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stop the heavy base drums coming through. A few bad nights later we asked to be moved to a higher floor, further away from the noise. We ended up on the 5th floor. The fashion week was about to come to an end, so that must have meant quiet nights and a good sleep finally. Our new neighbour on the 5th floor thought different about this. As soon as he arrived in his cabin (at 5.30 pm) he put his music on and this would continue until 11.30 pm. We tried to talk with him and asked him to put his music down and especially to lower the noise of his base drums. In this way we could watch television and actually hear what was said. But he never even opened his door to talk with us. And what was going on on this 5th floor? We never figured it out. It seemed to us that most of the residents of this floor were residents in the true sense of the word; we thought they were living there permanently. A strange bunch they were, too. What was this man doing in the hallway every time I went to the bathroom, even at 3 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock in the morning? He sometimes looked to be in a catatonic freeze and stood there for hours on end. Who was this fat guy making a mess of the bathroom and never saying a word even as he was spoken to? Who lived down our hallway in a cabin full of plastic bags? And where stayed the guy who was always smoking a joint? Coming from Amsterdam we sure do know the smell of it. True, the people who are working in The Jane are very nice and sympathetic. The rooms, bathrooms and linen are cleaned regularly. We made the best of our stay in The Jane. New York is fantastic and we had a wonderful time there.

One small note: better make sure everytime that your room is properly closed as I found my room as well as others slightly open (it is not anything tricky, but I found myself disabling actively several times disabling the closing device). For any reason, the heater was on high volume and as I could not find out how to lower the volume, I had the window half-open 24/7. There is also a nice gift from the hotel: a very nice bottle of water. The water was really bad (chlorine taste). Don't try to take this bottle with you! As you can read in the hotel info, the very nice bottle can be purchased for 30 USD. In most cases, mobile phone connection (I had a room to the inner court) was not possible. Room has a flat-screen TV (30 programmes) and an ipod docking station. Staff very nice and the number of guys being at the receoption even at late night is more than you would expect. Similarly, the old-style design seems to be rather upscale. Staff was rather surprised that I gave them a tip (in a modest way). The caf\u00c3\u00a9 next-door is quite nice, but - as the area around - rather pricey. The money you save (I paid approx 110 USD incl. tax per night) is nevertheless being spent on the rather pricey delis and caf\u00c3\u00a9s around if you want to have your breakfast in another location. Those are nevertheless in most cases Zagat- and Time-Out-recommended. Final word to the location: 150 metres to the river (between a busy street), 200 metres south of Meatpacking District and the nice Highline Park, it is a 10min walk to the subway. I realised that some taxi drivers have problems finding the street and finally the hotel itself (even the ones just standing 100 metres away...; The Jane is the last building on the street). Finally, it is not inside West Village, but on the Western edge of it. Means: you also need an at least 5 min walk to the caf\u00c3\u00a9 mentioned above. Recommended.

We did not get our own bathroom, I don't know if that is an option, but the shared bathrooms were clean and rarely busy. My main problem was the smell in the hall way and the noise in the middle of the night. There was a terrible smell all throughout the hallway, it made me gag each and every time I forgot to hold my breath while walking to or out of my room. I never habituated to the smell. However, when I entered my room I couldn't smell it anymore, so it was ok. The noise though, it wasn't constant, but the walls are paper thin and you can hear everything from all of the other rooms. I believe this place is very popular with young men, and on our first night at 4 AM, one of these men decided to kick our door and start screaming. He then said, \"oh S***, there is someone in this room, their stuff was all over the bed this afternoon\". I then wondered how he knew my stuff was all over the bed, the only way would be for him to have a key and access to my room while I was out. This was not comfortable at all, but thankfully, I didn't leave anything of value in my room, and nothing was missing after all.

We initially booked our stay back in June and loved the idea of this place, it's quirkiness and also the fact it was a budget hotel. The location of it was also instrumental in our choice as I really wanted to be in West Village having read about it's 'vibe'. So we booked up and were happy. You don't even need to pay a downpayment when you book so if for any reason you have to cancel your trip you don't get charged. Fast forward a few months and just before we leave I read on here a few horror stories about noise from the newly opened bar, roaches and bedbugs and I have to admit in doubting my decision. So I arrived with a can of RAID in my suitcase prepared for all eventualities... But, I have to say hand on heart, the hotel was excellent. Not a bug or roach in sight. The rooms and bathrooms were spotless and cleaned regularly. Rooms cleaned and bed linen changed/turned down daily whilst there. The staff were friendly and accommodating, from the doormen to the lift operator. Everyone was really helpful. And we heard no noise at all (though I suppose we were on the fifth floor). Considering how old the building is, and how small the rooms are, they are very well insulated as you cannot hear much going on once inside your own room. There was even work going on above us and on our floor (they are still refurbishing parts of the hotel) and we never heard a thing. We were put in 2 adjoining rooms on the 5th floor. The tiny cabin like rooms are cleverly designed like ships cabins with a full mirror on one wall so you don't feel too claustraphobic as it creates the feeling of it being bigger. Your suitcase goes under the bed. There is a digital safe in the drawer under the bed also (2 large drawers in all). There are railings on each wall to hang stuff up. There is an iPod dock/alarm clock, a widescreen TV, air con and a wall fan, a robe, x3 towels and a complimentary bottle of water included in the price also. The rooms are powered by an electrical 'key' which you plug in when you enter the room. Bear in mind that you take it out when youleave so anything you leave charging (ie phone) won't be charged as the electricity is only on when this thing is plugged in. Its a good idea to conserve power. Very green! We were early-ish risers due to wanting to explore in our 5 day trip so we got up about 7.30 each day. The bathrooms are situated at either ends of each floor and had two showers (with doors you lock) and two toilets in both. The showers were wonderful, water always hot and shower gel, shampoo and conditioners are also included in their wall dispensers inside the shower. By the bathroom sinks there are hairdryers. I can honestly say in our whole time there we never had to queue to have a shower or if one was occupied you just wandered to the other side to use that one instead. Our floor had quite a few residents (you can tell from their doors as they have key locks instead of the electrical system the hotel uses) but all of them we met were pleasant and friendly, esp one little guy that I kept meeting in the bathrooms while he brushed his teeth. He was very nice but I never found out his name (5th floor opp room 519). Admittedly there is a kind of musty smell in some corridors mostly because some of the residents may smoke in their rooms but on the whole it wasn't unpleasant and there are air fresheners on the walls too. Our room windows faced inward so you only overlook another room's window opposite but there are slatted blinds provided for your privacy at night. The only gripe we had was that the bar in the hotel was closed to residents practically every night we stayed for \"a Private Party\". There is a small pub like bar and a larger ballroom bar next door and these were off limits to guests when it was hired out and it was guest list only We were told that whilst the bar is IN the Jane Hotel, its privately owned and rented out regularly to whomever and the hotel has not much say in the matter. But the Jane is in a great area for plenty of other pubs/bars/resturants anyway all within a short stroll so it wasn't a problem. Plus the one night we DID get in the bar, the drinks were $12 dollars each!! And that was for a meagre glass of wine. So my advice go somewhere else for a tipple as IMO the owner of the Jane Bar must be a bit pretentious to charge those prices in a budget hotel. There is a Cafe/Coffee shop opening soon in the lobby area which looks to be good so that be a alternative to the bar. In the meantime the nearest deli Nonno Gourmet does loads of hot food, bagels, coffee to take out and if you walk North towards 14th St and 9th Av in the Meatpacking area there is a really cool diner that does fabulous breakfasts! The area itself is great and if you are relatively fit, you can easily walk southwards towards Downtown/Wall Street via Washington St or North towards Midtown (or get on subway at 14th St) We walked everywhere and the West Village is my favourite part of New York. Hudson St, Bleeker St are all close by and have a great choice of food places to eat. Oh and one last thing, if you are new to New York like me and didn't realise prices didn't include taxes, the Jane's $99 per night DOES NOT include taxes. Its not shown on your confirmation invoice either so don't get caught out. All in all plus taxes its approx $117 dollars per night. If I was to go back again, I would happily stay there again, with friends or on my own. I recommend New York (fell in love with the place) and I recommend the Jane experience.

I stayed for a week on business, and would likely recommend this hotel to budget travelers. High points: Charming historic building, an old elevator run by an operator, clean bathrooms. The small rooms are smartly designed, with shelves, overhead storage, drawers under the bed, hooks on the door, and several sliding hooks on each side of the room from which to hang clothing or towels. High speed internet was reliable and fast. My room was well-cleaned upon arrival. Things to be aware of: *The bathrooms, while clean, are truly shared. In other words, it is not one stand-alone bathroom that you enter and have to yourself, as it is in some hotels with shared bathrooms. The bathroom on my floor had two sinks, two shower stalls (with full-length doors) and two toilet stalls (with full length doors as well). If you are not comfortable using the toilets, sinks/mirrors, or entering/exiting the shower with others in the room - including those of the opposite sex - this may be an issue for you. *The hotel provides a set of disposable flip-flops, but mine both broke on my very first trip to the bathroom. You may wish to bring footwear of your own. *Shampoo, shower gel, and conditioner are provided in the showers from pumps. Bath towels and hand towels were provided, but not washcloths. You may wish to bring your own washcloth and/or shower poof. *Tissues were not provided in the rooms or the bathrooms. *The permanent residents of the building - mostly older, downtrodden types - may seem intimidating at first but I never encountered a problem. * The rooms are truly small. They are actually smaller than they look in the photos, so be prepared. * It's a bit of a walk to the subway station (about 6 minutes) and cabs don't pass the hotel as frequently as on other streets, so you may find yourself walking over to the next block to hail one. This, combined with the flight of stairs you need to ascend to enter the front door, makes this hotel less suitable for people with limited mobility or with large amounts of luggage. I sense that the management, possibly in part because of the location, wants to make the place a hip, trendy, boutique hotel of sorts. I hope this doesn't distract them from continuing to strive for what most travelers are really looking for: clean, safe, well-appointed rooms that are also affordable. Another reviewer's comment about the \"hipper-than-thou\" young desk clerk also suggest the hotel's inclination toward the trendy ambiance.

My first time in NY, though I am well travelled, and with a little trepidation after reading the mixed reviews on this site. My first room was 410 a corner room and though I expected the room to be small this was just teeny tiny. I am only 5 foot 5 and my feet hung over the end of the bed. It was also a bit noisy next to the stairwell door. When I explained my predicament to the extremely helpful staff (and extremely helpful throughout my 5 day stay) , I was moved to another room, 417. And they very kindly moved my luggage for me so I did not have to come back during the day to swap. I am very, very fussy when it comes to cleanliness - the bathrooms were always very clean and I never had to queue. My bedroom was clean and I had fresh towels. One day I'd not been left any so requested some - promptly given. Water - you only had to ask for it to be refilled. Crappy jandals - yes - but I just wore my own flip flops/jandals to the shower. There is a pretty awful smell in the corridors (on the 4th floor) anyway, which is quite overwhelming at times, and I'm not sure what they can do about it while the hotel is still shared with permanent residence. The smell does not pervade the rooms though and yes, the aircon was noisy, but fine for a quick blast to cool things down before sleeping.

I had the option of lugging it around with me or dropping it off at the desk and picking up a new one on my way back in. I picked the latter option. Everything was fine and dandy until I came back late Thursday night/Friday morning to find that there were no keys left. The man at the front desk looked high and low for one but ended up having to let me in the room with his master key. However, no rod, which meant no electricity other than the overhead light. Since I was leaving within hours anyway, it wasn't a huge deal, but it did put a damper on an otherwise pleasant stay. I did contact the hotel and was told that there's a stash of keys that the front desk guy apparently didn't know about. In spite of the key mess, I would definitely consider staying again.

It started out just fine until we tried to sleep after both having very long flights. The newly opened hotel bar really should be called a club AND it really should not be in this hotel. It kept both of us awake at all hours of the night. Remember that NYC bars don't shut down until about 4am. When we complained to the front desk, he tried to give us the excuse that all the rooms are soundproof. Nice try, but I don't think so. The bags under my eyes are proof. My friend has her own handful of complaints with this place - they didn't stock her room with clean towels and they didn't clean her room until we specifically asked and requested them to do so. This is probably the reason why when I woke up on one of the many nights I could not sleep : 3:30am : I found a bedbug crawling out from under my pillow. Not having ever seen a bedbug, I killed it immediately, then called the front desk to let them know. They immediately said they would find a room for me and call me back. After waiting for a bit, I looked back to my bed to find yet another bug crawling on the bed. This is where I took my clothes and bag and got the hell out of there. It was the most disturbing thing to me that I had been sleeping in the same room with bedbugs. They switched me to another room and though I didn't experience another bug in the new room, I woke up with bites by the time I was checking out. I'll be requesting a refund on this soon. Hope you have better luck! p.s. I almost forgot the best part. While trying to purchase a pair of shoes in NY, my debit card was declined. When I called my bank, they informed me that there was an $800 + charge from The Jane hotel in NYC. Now we were only staying there 4 nights so this was a surprise. My first thought was that they had charged me twice for my stay there. When I called to speak to the front desk, they were very rude and let me know that they \"hold\" 4 nights of the hotel on the card and that's what the charge was for. So, basically, they had charged me for all 4 nights of my stay upon check-in, didn't let me know, and completely depleted my checking account. They tried to tell me that it was in the contract that I had signed, but they didn't bother to point out that very important fact. This is the first place I've ever stayed where they charge you upon arrival.

As soon as we arrived, we were early for check-in and they were willing to store out bags for free until our check-in time of 3:00pm. The Lobby is extremely nice with a bar that seems to attract a huge line every night. The rooms were clean with an LCD screen on both the top and bottom bunk. Every room comes with AC, an IPOD dock. Although the rooms were extremely small, it provides a nice and safe place to crash ( who would want to stay in their hotel room when they are in NY). Bathrooms were also surprisingly clean. The cleaners do a good job in that regard. Location is also very convenient, only a few blocks from the nearest subway station and several classy restaurants. Very very safe area. A little far from the main attractions ( Times Square, Central Park) however, is walkable (if you're young). Negatives: - Although the rooms are clean, the hallway is disgusting. The Jane is shared with hotel and local residents. Therefore as you walk towards your room, each room breathes out a unique smell (mostly bad). There are also very poor people who live in the Jane who don't seem to have AC and leave their doors slightly open which leaves out a horrible smell. THere is also a resident who leaves his door open and just stares at people who walk past. Quite freaky but I'm sure he means no harm. Also came across roaches in our room a couple of times. Recently the hallway literally smelled like fresh feces which refuses to go away. The rooms are extremely small, enough to do a 360 on the spot. Our rooms were also missing the complimentary water as well as the \" do not disturb sign\". This place is not the newest nor the cleanest place but you can tell that the management is doing its best to make it a classy hotel. I wouldn't recommend it for the faint hearted. For the price I paid, I am pretty unsatisfied with my overall experience mainly because of the unhygienic conditions . I'd give this place five or so more years to develop and maybe I'd come back.

I've always been opposed to the idea of spending a trip in a big expensive hotel room watching TV, so I looked around and found the Jane. Rather than other dorm-style hostels, I wanted a private room with a BED TO SLEEP IN DURING THE NIGHT AND THAT WAS IT. And that is exactly what the charming Jane Hotel provided. My room was small (only 50 square feet) but was by NO MEANS CRAMPED FOR ONE PERSON...cozy would best describe it. I would call it a hotel bedroom rather than a hotel room. The room was VERY CLEAN and surprisingly well furnished, however. Complete with AC, fan, telephone, flatscreen TV with cable, clean linens/towels, drawers, and a safe, I was very surprised upon entering the room. The pictures from the website do not lie in what the rooms look like. Down the hall was the very clean and easily accessible COMMUNAL BATHROOMS with showers. The 1908 building originally held sailors and some Titanic survivors, and still had that old-style charm. There was a nice bar and lounge area that always had some big party with live bands going on every night. I stayed during the last stages of the Jane's construction (they're adding bigger rooms on some floors and a restaurant off the lobby that are scheduled to be completed by Fall 2009) The staff was VERY VERY FRIENDLY, always offering assistance when needed and greeting you with very friendly attitudes. They made me feel like I lived there, which was something I've never felt from the cold, cookie-cutter service of big-name hotels. The Jane is in a GREAT LOCATION between the Meatpacking District and the West Village, really close to great restaurants, shopping, and transit stops. For my first time on my own in NYC, I couldn't have picked a better area to start off in. NOTE TO TRAVELERS: The Jane hotel does have permanent tenants who live in the Hotel as their home. This wasn't a problem to me one bit, I just thought it might be good to know beforehand. ALSO NOTE that due to construction some services that would be expected aren't currently available (room service, etc) AGAIN I WANT TO STATE that this is not a super-spacious luxury hotel room, it's a room with a bed. As soon as I woke up I was out seeing the great city, rather than doing nothing in my room. However, the rooms are very comfortable and offer a great refuge to relax and take a break from the hot, busy city. Overall it's a great value for New York standards (I paid 89$/night for 2 nights and 79$ the 3rd) This was the first time I traveled alone and only my second time to NYC, but my experience at the Jane will ensure my return sooner than late.", "Date": "July 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA simple bed for the night\u201d", "Author": "Marcil1", "ReviewID": "UR35565814", "Content": "The Jane is fine for the simple traveler who won't be spending any time in their room.

The stylish retro black and white tiled bathrooms were always very clean, and I never had to wait to use them. There was always ample hot water and great, powerful showers. The white waffle robes and slippers are a nice touch. My only minor gripes were that the cabins got very hot and stuffy, but in such a small staff the air conditioning unit was so loud as to make listening to music or watching television impossible.
