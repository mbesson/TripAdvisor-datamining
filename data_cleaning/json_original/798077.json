This Ovolo in Aberdeen offered an awesome price in the peak season when everywhere is full. Service is very attentive, the manager can greet me with my name when I check in. Its really surprised me! The room is large, staff is friendly and eager to help. Free Wifi! For a comfortable stay at a good price (for Hong Kong) , this is a great choice.", "Date": "July 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cBeware of Bed bugs!!\u201d", "Author": "Jen R", "ReviewID": "UR133378909", "Content": "We had found this serviced apartment in Abderdeen because most of the hotels were fully booked due to the time we had flown to Hong Kong.

At first, the place seemed pretty decent as there was ample space,a kitchen to make breakfast, a tv, decent shower etc. Except when I woke up the next morning, i saw 14-15 red marks on my leg, which eventually grew in size and was very itchy. It wasn't mosquitoe bites at all, and fit all the descriptions of bed bugs. This had thoroughly ruined my trip as my leg was now scarred with these gross marks. I had to switch hotels and wash everything so i did not take these bugs back with me to Canada.

The hotel is very clean and well run. The room had everything needed - cups, dishes, pans and there is maid service 6 days a week. The staff is very helpful and attentative. It is a bit out of the way for Central and Kowloon, but there are ample buses nearby. We had a mountain view room (which is really a very large cemetary) but one window did overlook Aberdeen Harbour which is beautiful. Take the ferry to Lamma Island for lobster and squid at the Lamma Mandrian Restaurant and a swim at Lo So Shing beach.
