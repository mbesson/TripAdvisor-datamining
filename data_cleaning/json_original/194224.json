Markets are held by the metro Maubert Mutualit\u00e9 several mornings a week and sell various things: flowers, foods,cheese, nuts, as well as a variety of scarves (great light gifts) and clothing, The best thing (beyond the fine location) about the hotel which put \"the icing on the cake\" was the wonderful staff who worked hard to make sure our needs were met and made many helpful suggestions to us, which enhanced our trip and helped us get to and fro locations, including the airport, efficiently. Their superb reputation, already recorded in Trip Advisor, led me to try the h\u00f4tel and I was not disappointed. Whether or not you spoke French was no problem and the staff all tried hard to make sure we were having a happy and comfortable stay. They also had a little fridge which we used quite often to store perishable food (e.g. for picnics) A simple breakfast of coffee or tea with bread and croissant and jam is offered for an additional supplement. The rooms are comfortably furnished in a practical style and very clean - beds are comfortable and our double had a clean and pleasant bathroom equipped with a large bathtub and separate toilet. Both my friend and I slept well there and our room on the courtyard was quiet most of the time, with occasional possiblilites for eavesdropping on noise from other guests living on the courtyard.

My cousin had a single room #105 with bath, and her only complaint was getting in the room due to her lock\u2019s difficulty. Our room #106 had a twin bed and a double bed, a tv, a bureau, and a small table with telephone. The tv was great and received many channels including several in English such as CNN. There was a separate room for the toilet and another for the tub/shower combo and the sink. Soap/shampoo was provided, I think. Everything was clean. One very big plus for this hotel was the a/c. It worked beautifully and cooled the room down it minutes-mainly humid and not that hot when we were there, but a great asset. The fire alarm went off just after we arrived and was a nuisance. I thought the hotel had free wifi (I thought I saw it only their French website, but I can\u2019t find it now so maybe I was looking at the Hotel des Carmes in Rouen? They said theirs was 2 euros for 30 minutes. There was no safe so I carried my valuables with me to dinner. The woman at the front desk when we checked in was a bit curt, but perhaps it was because it was the end of her shift. Everyone else was ok. One complaint on check-in was that we had to fill out the form with our passport, address, etc. This practice ended about a decade ago, but some hotels still are in the past. I didn\u2019t have to do it anywhere else in France and haven\u2019t done it on most of my previous 20 visits either. Join the 21st century please. The hotel lobby was clean and the elevator and stairs were as they should be. The front entrance was just 50m up the hill from the twice weekly market. The location of the hotel was fantastic- just down from the Pantheon and close to the wonderful restaurants-especially La Harpe-and others near Church St. Severin. Also, decent priced tacky souvenirs in that same area. This was the second best hotel I\u2019ve stayed at in the Latin Quarter area. If it\u2019s available, stay two blocks away at the Hotel du College de France on Rue Ternes. I like to try out new hotels, and one day will return to those I really like. I recommended the HCF to my friend\u2019s potential grandson-in-law, and he and her granddaughter stayed there just before New Year\u2019s and were treated very special and invited to share dessert and champagne with the staff at their party even though they knew no French. I would consider staying at the Hotel des Carmes again as the prices were good but probably won\u2019t. The breakfast was just bread, coffee, and cold cuts. Juice was extra! There was a computer station off the breakfast room which I did use for a few minutes. Not sure if that one is free or the lady before got off with some time remaining. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything extra special, but it was safe and clean and fairly priced. They need to add free wifi, put a safe in each room, and add at least boiled eggs and juice to the breakfast selection.

There was no street noise, though noise from the hallway and other rooms was noticeable (but usually not a problem). Towels felt cheap and we suspected the sheets were not changed unless we asked for it - no big deal though. Most surprising was that shampoo was not provided, and the tiny pieces of soap were not restocked until we asked the fourth day (and even then somewhat grudgingly). I don't know if it's normal to bring your own soap to Parisian hotels, but this came as a surprise to us. They can't be worth more than 10 cents each. The hair dryer was an industrial vacuum cleaner style unit that became uncomfortably hot to hold, and, like any old vacuum cleaner, the handle slipped off from time to time. These are probably due for replacement. There was a modern and efficient AC unit, which was nice for clearing the steam after a hot shower. Service was polite but not especially friendly, aside from one fellow named Tony who apparently was leaving.

When leaving, the receptionist tried for a long time to get us a shuttle, but finally recommended a taxi for the three of us, as it was too late for a shuttle. One morning I opened the French window in our room and was just amazed by the view, as the sky was light pink and gray and the clouds looked golden (This is only in Paris, and no I was not dreaming: la vie en rose).

If you prefer to picnic, the little square at the junction of Rue de Carmes and Rue de Ecoles, about 100m down from the hotel has a market some mornings and a row of fantastic shops that sell all the fresh produce and wine that you will need to eat and drink.

Merci beaucoup to Luc who was incredibly patient and good-humored with us despite our endless requests! Besides the excellent staff, what makes this hotel special is its unbeatable location. It is half a block from a Metro stop, a fine wine shop, fromagerie, poissonerie, charcuterie, cremerie, boulangerie, pattiserie, a few brasseries, and other \"ries\" you can think of. It is also only a 5-minute walk from Notredame Cathedral. What more, there is a street market every other day right by the Metro stop, where you can pick up fresh fruits or an inexpensive pashmina!

First of all - the location: its simply perfect! 3 minutes of walking to Notre Dame and Conciergerie; 3 minutes to the Pantheon; wide selection of public transportation (buses and metro stations are 2 minutes of walking). Secondly, very kind, helpful and cheerful stuff (and most important - good and accurate English speaking).
