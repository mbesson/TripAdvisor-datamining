It's pretty misleading from the pictures shown and I didn't have much of an expectation when I booked this hotel. In gist it's small and they charge 100 SGD for a room, eventhough the advert states that it's 85SGD, perhaps it's additional taxes and what not. The location, decently located within walking distance from the Outram Park MRT, but from the MRT it's difficult to know where is the actual location since there is no landmark to pinpoint it's location. It's located right next to an Indian Temple and it's housed in a pre war shophouses, hence the term 'boutique' hotel. Along the same row there is a ridiculously small 7-11 convenience store. Once in the premises, it's dingy looking and and dark. Electricity bills must be really expensive. It's no frills and the rooms is as small as it can be, similar to hotels in Hong Kong. Hardly had any room to walk. Water is chargeable at 2SGD a pop. The rooms are dark, and the lightings are scarce. There are cracks all over the wall and the most glarring thing is that there is NO WINDOWS, hence no ventilation whatsoever. The bathroom are small and basic, a shower is provided. The mattress is acceptable but not comfy, blankets are old and torn. You get the gist of it. Room doors are thin and there is no latch apart from a safety hook. Breakfast is provided, only 3 in 1 coffee, some juices, bread and eggs. Basic is the word of the day. All in all, it might be a nostalgic experience for some, (not many if I may opine), Perhaps for Westerners this hotel might be appealing since they have not experience it before, but for many asians, the set up of this hotel, it's rooms and the services, are reminiscent of those cheap 'love hotels' where prostitutions are the main business.Would I stay here again? I definitely wont, even if it's the cheapest hotel around. Would I term this a boutique hotel, MOST DEFINATELY NOT.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paris, France", "Title": "\u201cA simple & economic place in the heart of Chinatown\u201d", "Author": "Smile92", "ReviewID": "UR117701050", "Content": "We stayed four nights in this hotel which offered low rates in mid-august. This place is old-style but not of bad taste. The first room we were given was small (+/- 15m\u00b2), but nice and clean (#101), with a simple decor and dark wooden floor. The bathroom was very small (2.5m\u00b2) with a toilet, a sink and a shower with curtains shrinked in. There was plenty of space & closets in the bedroom for our laundry, suitcases etc., as well as a minibar for which we were asked to pay a deposit of 10S$ upon check-in in case we would drink its water bottles! There was no safe in the room which we disliked very much, especially since there was a big warning on the door stating \"do not leave any valuable in the room... the hotel management could not be held responsible in case of theft ... blablabla...\" which was not reassuring. We had no other choice but to leave some valuables at the Reception's safe, but it was so tiny we had to carry most of them on us permanently. In terms of comfort & quietness, room 101 should be absolutely avoided as it is the closest one to the lobby, the elevator's motor room, the breakfast room, and the noisy Keong Saik road. During the day, we missed some shadow curtains for more intimacy. At night, there was no black curtains at all the cover the upper window, so we suffered from the daylight. The noise was permanent day and night, and worsened by the trendy white cafe across the street with loud music up to 2am (except on sundays). The rates included breakfast so it was cool to have an instant coffee, some toast, cereals and eggs on site. (there are only two coffee table so we guess when the hotel is packed breakfast must become epic!) We asked the hotel to store our bags for 2 nights. The Reception staff agreed but asked us to pay 3S$ per piece, even if we had made a booking for the following night. Of course, for that price, our luggage stayed in the lobby during 48 hours since there is no storage room! It looked like every little extra service has a cost in this hotel, and it was not pleasant. Finally, when we returned, we were given a nice room on the third floor, on the street but away from the elevator. We really enjoyed that one as it was bigger and quieter. If we were given this room from the beginning, we would have stayed in this hotel until the end of our journey.

Breakfast is fairly basic (cereals and toast) but at least it's part of the price. Staff generally helpful. Rooms kept reasonably well by the cleaning staff. Its biggest plus is the location in Chinatown - not too far from Outram Park MRT (an interchange station), and walking distance to almost anywhere in Chinatown.

We looked at all reviews and wanted somewhere in China town, with easy access to MRT to get to and from the airport, somewhere cheap and clean. We got all this from the Keong Saik Hotel. It was easy to jump onto the MRT and get off at either the China town (walk back towards the main road, dont walk towards all the lovely market stalls! take a left and ignore the first road, even though its called the Keong Saik road and take the next left, its just up there on the right) or you could get off at Outram Park, which means no changing trains. Come out of the tube and follow the shelter left along the busy road, until you get to the cross roads with traffic lights, cross over both lanes of traffic, straight up and then the hindu temple is on your right and the Keong Saik hotel is just there. Both routes will take about 2 / 3 mins walking, even with a heavy backpack! The hotel has a lift, a kind of bar / small dinning area where you have breakfast, but be warned it only seats about 6 people, 2 small tables and a small breakfast bar, so if there are lots of people you will have to wait or come back later.

My first impression was good: kind and smiling reception staff, a spacious air-conditioned lobby, a general impression of cleanliness and good organization. They offer three types of rooms: standard, superior and deluxe. The rates they currently have on their website [--] are not accurate; when I visited, they were charging SGD 70, 80 and 90 respectively for a single room, SGD 10 extra for a twin/double. I stayed in a standard room since this is basically all they had left when I arrived. My room, number 104, was on the main floor, darkish (no window) and not really inviting. The room felt musty, but upon inserting my room key in the provided slot, the air con turned on and I started to feel more comfortable within about 10 minutes. What I liked about the room: it was clean, with nice wooden floors and a large firm bed with clean sheets, a decent-sized closet with a few hangers, a small working table with wooden stool, a phone, a neat bathroom (albeit small) with good water pressure and a shower curtain to separate the shower area from the rest of the bathroom (you wonder why most budget hotels here in Singapore don\u2019t even bother to install shower curtains in their bathrooms!). My room also featured one of these remote control units for the lights that you usually find in more expensive hotels, although it malfunctioned a couple of times during my stay, turning on the entry light around 6-7 AM on a couple of occasions. The remote control unit also controlled the air conditioning and the TV. Regarding the TV, I don\u2019t understand why they bothered installing a 20-inch colour TV in the room while giving you access to only one channel with a crisp image! The only thing I disliked about the room was the lack of a window, which makes the room downright depressing. Don\u2019t plan on spending any serious time in there when you\u2019re not sleeping! Anyway, if you book long enough in advance, you should be able to get one of their deluxe or superior rooms, all with windows. If you want a room that faces Keong Saik Street, be advised that these rooms only come with two twin beds, which might not be to your liking. The clincher for me, I must say, was their wireless Internet access. The good news is that unlimited access only costs SGD 8 per day (this is a steal if you compare that to the $30 charged by Hotel 81 in Chinatown!). The bad news, however, is that you can only access it from the lobby and the breakfast area, which makes the price far less of a deal. Hopefully, this will have been remedied by the time you stay here. I visited a lot of budget hotels while in this part of Singapore and can safely say that this place is one of the better deals: for the price, you get a clean room, regular smiles from the front desk staff and even a basic breakfast thrown in! If you want a budget hotel in this city, you better do your homework carefully because there are a lot of dives in Singapore, especially in Chinatown and in the East. This place is definitely not one of them.", "Date": "January 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Conwy, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGREAT - and then some\u201d", "Author": "esorlegin", "ReviewID": "UR6540416", "Content": "We booked into Keong Saik for the first 6 days of our 3 weeks in S E Asia. The staff are so helpful and friendly, the rooms are clean and tidy and the beds are very comfortable. DO NOT expect the Ritz and you will have a great time. Rooms at the back second floor (207,208) can be a bit noisy due to the airconditioning equpiment. Nothing that will stop you sleeping. Rooms at the front are (mostly) quiet and have some street views. To give you a point of reference - we also stayed at Traders in KL - we do enjoy our comforts. Next time we visit Singapore, we will be staying here.

I mean a Singapore hotel room at that low rate will not offer you facilities of an let's say 90 SGD room. There are no spacious bath rooms, no 100 channel TV, there is no fancy breakfast buffet, there is nobody who carries your luggage. I think the point is: tends that cheap hotel to \"noisy, dirty, unfriendly and bad located\" or tends it to \"quiet, clean, friendly and well located\". In my opinion Keong Saik Hotel tends to mostly quiet, very clean and smart, quite friendly and well located if you enjoy squeezed and lively areas like Chinatown. I found the room very small but smart arranged and everything in a good shape, absolutely clean, everything works,.the materials used are nice, wooden floor in good condition, no cheap bath room tiles, huge wardrobe with many hangers, the air condition is individually controlable. The bath room is bright and clean and very small, indeed, app. 1,5 m x 2 m for toilet, washbasin and shower all together, but you got large clean towels, soap and shampoo, and the shower curtain is long enough not to turn your room into a swimming pool, everything is smart installed. The bed is around 180 cm, rather short. The mattress comfortable hard. The linen clean. The breakfast follows, let's say, Chinese pragmatism. Everything is prepacked, instant coffee sachets, jam and butter packages, cornflakes in 200g packs, even the toast is still wrapped. One chafing dish with fried eggs is the only cooked thing you meet at breakfast. A thermos to make your tea or coffee and carafes with milk and orange syrup you will also meet. Make the best of it to start your day and read the daily newspaper Strait Times they provide. Choose amongst two small tables and a kitchen bar with four high chairs to have a seat. Yes, it is squeezed and some may say it's a joke but it gives you the essential start to the day (as someone already said in the review of Feb 25, 2006). The staff is friendly, there was no problem to fix, so I cannot rate their willingness and ability to help. The location is double-edged, I think. Keong Saik Road is part of an amusement district in Chinatown, so certainly a nice place to get cheap food in simple shops and late night entertainment in clubs and bars. Nobody disturbs or approaches the hotel guests, and as everywhere in Singapore it's secure. The MRT is few hundred meters close to bring you to finer places if you want. Therefore I would not stay with my family or for honeymoon in that area and all its squeezed hotels. I come frequently to Singapore and know hotel rooms of 90 SGD and 135 SGD category, overall it was good value for money. If you can spend 90 SGD I would recommend the area of Bencoolen Street and its hotels.", "Date": "October 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Keong Saik Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d584452-Reviews-Keong_Saik_Hotel-Singapore.html", "Price": "$107 - $108*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">69 Keong Saik Road</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">089165</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "584452", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/02/c6/85/double-room.jpg"}}
