Great pool area with hot tub and water slides was great for our kids. Only complaint would be that seating is somewhat limited.

The rooms were nice size and very clean!!! The concierge was also very nice and helpful. Food choices at and surrounding this hotel were very limited, and thus quite pricey... We went to SeaWorld for at least a portion of each day we were there. On the map it looks like this hotel is right next to SeaWorld, but it is a good 20 minute walk to get there (and I walk fast).

The staff was very friendly, offering to store our luggage when we arrived three hours before check-in time, notifying the cleaning staff that we had arrived so they could clean our room and have it ready quickly, and offering to shuttle us to and from a popular beach spot a mile away at no charge. Our room was just what we asked for, including the bay view which we had specified, and was very clean even on our early check-in. The concierge helped us get tickets to the zoo for the same day and printed them right at the hotel, including passes for the various tours offered. Everything in town, including the Gaslamp district, Petco Park, Old Town, and the zoo were no more than 15 minutes away, and the beach was only a mile away. The pool area included three different pools, two waterslides, and a large hot tub.

They are nice, but as I find with many of the more upscale places, they charge you for all the little things, and that's truly annoying. $20 for parking (tiny spaces, too) and fees for wi-fi and the business center (with my Hyatt membership, I get free wi-fi, but had no laptop, so I had to go to the business center to use their pay machines). I think they figure since people are 'splurging' to stay there, or are on expense accounts, they can pick up some extra cash that way. There are a lot of people griping on here about these expenses. Hope these chains start noticing, but probably not....it's ok, no one is entitled to this stuff. But I always find it funny that lower-end hotels wil gladly provide free wi-fi and business center access to all, but when you get to the 4- and 5-stars, it's \"Whammo, sucker! Fork over some more cash!\" Overall, the location is wonderful. I had a beautiful room overlooking the pool and marina. Very relaxing. It was a short walk the next morning to the beach. It was cold out on my stay, so I didn't use the pool. Very short drive to the airport, but far enough that we weren't under a flight path. Shower was pretty good. Good pressure and temp, but the head was short enough that I had to duck down to get my head wet.

Check-in was not favorable at all, although my request for an upgrade was available. We waited a few hours for our room to be available and did spend those hours at the over-crowded pool.

They really should consider replacing the overstuffed chair with a more useful small table and chairs set. I thought the bed was very comfortable,but husband complained it was too soft. The walls were pretty thin as we could hear our neighbors loud and clear. The fridge was a nice addition, though. My biggest gripe was the parking fee ($20) for self-parking in an unsecured lot! Really? Shame. Oh, and no free Wi-Fi! Free Wi-Fi is a must for any resort these days. For being a \"luxury\" hotel, I thought the no wi-Fi was pretty bad. The other thing I noticed was the dog feces all over the place. I'm not sure if they allow animals in the hotel, but there was plenty of \"evidence\" around. I had to keep reminding my kids to avoid the several \"land mines\" on the walking paths. Disgusting. I will say the staff were nice and friendly and the hotel itself has lovely grounds.

It\u2019s a lovely location so close to Sea-World. It is a nice property close to the water and has nice pool facilities. I was expecting a little warmer water in the pools and especially the water slides. The cool breezes during April were a little too cool. Perhaps that is why they ran out of pool towels? The room rates are a little high (about $250 a night) for what you get. I was expecting a premium stay for that premium price. That is not what happed. For starters expect to pay $20 a night for parking, if you can find some in their small lot. Expect an average room sized room with small and old furniture. Our dresser had only two drawers for a family of four and the top drawer would not stay closed. I had to stuff a shirt in it so it would stay closed. The bathroom was small but nice. It had an open counter with no drawers and limited storage. I have stayed at larger hotel s for half the price. Luckily it had a small refrigerator because they don\u2019t offer a continental breakfast. When staying at a hotel close to a theme park it would be convenient to grab a quick breakfast and go. They only offer an expensive menu breakfast or continental breakfast to the noisy outdoor conference attendees. We stopped by a Target and grabbed breakfast items. Unfortunately the rooms don\u2019t have a microwave so it had to be a cold breakfast. Cold food does get tiring after a week. And don\u2019t think there will be a microwave in the lobby for you to use. There isn\u2019t. I guess TV snack items like popcorn are out of the question. But don\u2019t worry you won\u2019t be watching TV with the kids. They don\u2019t have Disney, Nickelodeon or ANY other kids channels on the TV. We did find PBS but my kids are older than the Sesame Street programing and it wasn\u2019t on in the evenings anyway. I thought no problem I\u2019ll show them a movie on my iphone with Netflix on free WiFi. NO! Expect to pay $13.95 for Wifi per day!! I\u2019m not sure who pays for WiFi anymore? It\u2019s free at McDonalds, Starbucks and most other hotels I have stayed at. Staying at a Hyatt one would expect great maid service which didn\u2019t happen to us. Yes she vacuumed, made the bed and dumped the garbage but that was it. No dusting or even resupplying soap, Kleenexes or towels. When we arrived there were only two towels in the room so we called down a got two more. One would think that after using 4 towels we would get 4 new towels. NO we had to call down 2 more days until she started to leave 4. We also called down for Shampoo and Conditioner, Kleenex and coffee cups. None of those supplies were resupplied without us calling or leaving a note. Once we called they were quick to respond but that is NOT service to me. I\u2019m on vacation I don\u2019t want to have to think ahead if tomorrows shower has the necessary supplies. They should just be there! We starting leaving a daily note for the maid and that seemed to work. The beds and pillows were very comfortable. Almost too comfortable because the radio clock didn\u2019t work and so it was easy to oversleep. It would be terrible to miss the shuttle to Sea-World. WAIT! There is NO shuttle anymore to Sea-World. What? They are 1 \u00bd miles away and most guests attend Sea-World at one point and no Shuttle? No we had to drive the 1 \u00bd miles and then pay the $14 parking fee. (The Dana next door still has a shuttle) Bad management cut-back on that one! You can see my growing frustration. It\u2019s not just one thing this hotel did terrible or inexcusable. It\u2019s just a whole bunch of little things that added up to make our stay not as good as it should. At least not $2,000 a week worth! I wouldn\u2019t consider myself a picky person. Most hotels have something everyone wouldn\u2019t like but not a whole laundry list like the Hyatt at Mission Bay had for us. I\u2019m not even including all the items on my list in this review. I am tired of typing. In summary, we almost definitely will not be staying there again. The Hyatt brand now leaves a bad taste in my mouth. If I were you I would consider staying at another property.

We started off in the ground level suite there was 4 of us 2 children under 5 in the party the balcony which opens up to the marina is a public walk way so you have people doing the eye spy thing start in your room beware when walking out of bathroom with blinds open. The room smelt awful as really does not get sun in the room so you have a stale salt smell. Made worse by the cleaning staff not cleaning out the fridge of week old pizza and orange juice. There is a warning on fridge that they are not cold enough to keep medical or dairy products cold, let me tell you it didn't keep any thin g cold. The beds are soft for the first few hours you will then wake up with a sore back as the beds are old and sagging in the middle of the bed. Bathroom was really old again not much positive here. No coffee/tea supplies in rooms, tvs old and do not have a good range of channels and we lost channels during our stay due to \"problems with account holder\" this was displayed on tv screen. Line is thin, towels have strange smell about them and you could see bleach marks through them. Parking is really poor not enough parking for quests by 8pm and is illegal to park on street, see front of office people explain no parking they will let you park in the valet parking for same cost as self parking but be quick this fills as well. We asked to be change to a different room due to people striking up conversations with children from path when they sat on balcony some grubby people use this path. We were changed to 2nd level but rooms had same problem but did get sun to burn out the smell. You will hear people in other rooms above and below you and staff with room service or cleaning you will hear as the trolleys run over the gaps in path for that clunk clink clunk sound all hours.

I have paid additional parking fees in large cities downtown but I can't see how this property gets away with it since they are not downtown, and they have a huge parking lot for guests. This always seems a bit dishonest to me because people reserving rooms on the major internet sites think they are getting one price when in fact, the price is $20 higher per night. The right thing to do is just raise your room rates $20 and don't charge for parking. We were placed in a two story building with a small room that was very musty smelling. I could not take it. So I went to the front desk and spoke to Jeff who did change my room to the tower. The difference in the rooms from the two story to the tower is significant. We went from a small smelly room to a much larger room with a air purifier in the room and a balcony with a great view of the harbor. They did not have a room with two beds available so Jeff sent up a complimentary rollaway bed. Jeff is a great asset to this property and if it were not for him, I would have rated the hotel very low. He salvaged our stay. Both rooms had off white walls, white comforters, and were very bland and should be updated.

Weird bathroom. No bath tub, only a stand up shower! Additional costs were $20 a day for parking and $15 a day for high speed internet. We knew about these costs ahead of time, and since we had a good deal with Price Line it didn't really bother us. We did NOT use the hotel internet, we went to Starbuck's instead where it is free. It seems to me that the parking and internet fees should now adays be included in the nightly rate! The room and hallways were clean. The hotel concierge has discounted tickets for local attractions including the zoo. The room initially didn't have any facecloths and only minimal hangers. These were added upon request. The weather was very cool while we were in San Diego, so we didn't use the pool and only used the hot tub once. The pool has slides which the children seem to be enjoying. The hot tub was nice, but not that big.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cSurprisingly poor\u201d", "Author": "Mark S", "ReviewID": "UR126595933", "Content": "Just completed a family vacation where the last 3 nights were spent in San Diego. I had stayed at the Hyatt Mission Bay many years ago and liked its proximity to Seaworld which is why I chose it again. Here are my gripes: 1. Room check out is 11 a.m. so when arriving at 4 p.m. to check in, and then told that you have to wait an hour because the rooms were not available is very frustrating (turns out only one housekeeper on the floor which is why 6 hours later not all the rooms were ready). 2. NO communication as to why the rooms were not ready and I had to keep checking back with the desk, despite giving them my cell phone number to eventually get checked in. 3. Was promised when booking that two adjacent rooms on the ocean side in the Regency Club level would be secured. Upon arriving they had \"no record\" of this request, wanted to give me two rooms that were not adjacent (which I refused since I have kids) and I had to eventually take the two rooms they did have available on the non-view side. 4. Rental car was damaged by their so called Valet car parkers, which is ACE by the way, who of course refuse to accept any liability for their damage and now I will need to fight with Hertz and Allstate. The manager from Ace investigating the claim was nice enough, but it was clear from the outset that they had no intention of doing the right thing and accepting responsibility for their negligence.

Four sleepless nights... We stayed in 'The Suites' building that runs along the length of the marina and there were sea lions barking all night long every night that we were there. We tried to get a fan from the front desk to help drown out the noise but apparently fans are a hot commodity and there were none available. The bed was lumpy and very soft. The hotel doesn't use fitted sheets, so if you move around too much, the sheets start to shift and cause rolls of lumps that are not very comfortable to sleep on. The pillows leave something to be desired as well.... They smoosh down as soon as you lay on them and provide zero support. Another thing was this stench near the bed. It smelled of urine. I couldn't quite pin down where the smell was coming from, but it seemed to be coming from the carpet and/or the bastketweave fabric-like headboard. We actually went to Target to purchase Febreeze to help cover the stench. As far as the room itself, it is decent. It's a good size but with mildly ugly decor and a nice patio overlooking the marina. The fridge is a pile of crap. There is a warning sign on the fridge that says \"Refridgerator can not safely store medical or dairy products\", so if you're a milk drinker or need to store your insulin, you're out of luck. The fridge is very small, not even large enough to store a couple beers and a leftovers container. I did not try any of the restaurants on site so I can not comment on that. The pool area is nice and the bar by the pool serves a decent cocktail. I'll finish with something positive.... The hotel staff are friendly and courteous and the cleaning crew does a good job of remaking the bed and filling the towels and such. The hotel is in a good area with very easy access to highways and to downtown. The view of the marina truly is beautiful and is very nice to look out upon in the morning.

We called down to the front desk at about 8 p.m. to ask when we could expect the noise to die down (we have a little one who was going to need to sleep), and were told that the reception would be over at 11 p.m. It wasn't until my husband went down to the front desk that we were offered more than ear plugs. At that point, we changed rooms, gaining quiet, but losing our awesome view. I have a hard time believing that the sound and the music at the reception had to be so loud (that we could hear it 15 floors up) in order for the guests to enjoy themselves.

Since we live in Reno , after each surgery my wife and I like to stay in a nice hotel for a few days to recover from the hospital stay before heading home. Now that I think about it, maybe I'm not the most objective person to write this review. Let's face it, after ten days in a hospital, Motel Six would probably feel like the best Four Season's in the world. Even though we are Starwood regulars we picked the Hyatt Regency on Mission Bay for this stay. We wanted to be on the water , however, we also needed a handicap room because at the time I was in a brace and switching back and forth from walker to wheelchair. Not only did the Hyatt have the needed room, it was a beautiful one bedroom suite overlooking the marina. The hotel has both a tower in addition to a lowrise wing that runs along the marina. Can't speak to the rooms in the tower , but the room on the marina we had was just fantastic. The stay started , as all do, with a stop in the lobby. Since I was in a body and neck brace with a wheelchair and walker , not to mention a lot of luggage , we were a handful . But, the bellhops and the valets were more than up to the task. Excellent service. My wife and I have spent a lot of time in the islands and we both agreed that the Hyatt Mission Bay had the same feel as many of the resorts we've stayed in there over the years. Add about fifteen degrees to the temp, it was early October, and the feel would have been as tropical as you need. Since I wasn't up to it, we didn't get to experience the restaurant .However, I can tell you the aroma the kitchen generated was tremendous. The room service dining was just fine. During my last follow up visit to the surgeon we stayed downtown for a little Christmas feel. However, now that I'm out of my brace and feeling better , come March when my next doctor's visit comes , we will be back at the Hyatt to enjoy all that I missed during my last visit.Great people.

Along with two free nights you're afforded the opportunity to upgrade to suite accomodations twice. I reserved one of the suites overlooking the bay from the smaller side section adjacent to the main tower. When we checked in we were informed that we had been upgraded \"again\" to the penthouse suite. The suite wasn't quiet ready, so we walked to the back of the hotel by the pool. Another beautiful, sun kissed day in San Diego. We ordered a couple drafts at the pool bar and really enjoyed gazing at the waterfront, the marina, the seals, the birds...it was just beautiful. The property is so well maintained, and the staff is so very friendly and curteous.They informed us our \"suite\" was ready. They gave us the keys, and said the bellhop would be right up with our luggage. We placed the key in the \"PH\" slot on the elevator wall and away we went, not really knowing what to expect. When we opened the door, it was incredible. The entire top floor is our hotel \"suite\" or should I say \"sweet\". Two bedrooms, two and half baths, a huge den w/ fireplace, a bar a full kitchen and full entertainment system. There were several glass sliding doors that lead to the outside patio. The \"patio\" encircles the suite and goes completely around the top of the hotel. We had a wonderful time and we had a delicious grilled salmon dinner via room service as we gazed over ALL of San Diego while dining.

It has an \"open-air\" feel about it, especially in the reception area; and it certainly feels like a resort. The hotel is a series of smaller buildings surrounding a main \"tower\". The interconnecting grounds are absolutely beautiful. However, during the place in time I was a guest, it was unusually cold in San Diego, and I did not like having to go outside to go the restuarant, or lobby, etc. The hotel is in a marina setting, with beautiful views of Mission Bay. The rooms seem to be fairly recently upgraded (I believe this is an extremely old hotel, although faily well maintained). My room was nice enough--very attractive with a small balcony. Bathroom was very tight, but, serviceable. Regardless of what temperature I set the thermostat, the room never rose above 72. This may be fine and enjoyable for some, but, I was always cold, and in the 4 days I was there, I grew to resent this, and thus cannot say I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Since I travel quite a bit, I have come to appreciate buffets in the restaurant--so that I can fix my plate the way I want it. But, there was no buffet at this hotel, although the breakfast they served was totally acceptable. This hotel is in a fairly secluded area of San Diego. I think some people would really appreciate this. I do not. If I want to be secluded, I stay home in my bedroom. I first learned that I do not seclusion when I stayed at the Hyatt Miramar Resort in Puerto Rico. It didn't take long before I started feeling trapped and imprisoned!!! I am a vacation / traveller who likes city lights, and activity around me. The Mission Bay is not really my cup of tea, although it may be for others. There beautiful pools and cabannas; and palm trees--just not what I need in a home away from home. I would recommend this hotel for folks who enjoy getting away and being secluded. It seems to be a good option for this type of traveller, and especially if you still want to be within striking range of a major city and all it has to offer. But, if you would like to be able to walk to attractions, catch a cab to a restuarant, or walk to a club, or museum down the street--this place is not for you.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cnothing to go out of your way for\u201d", "Author": "durgaChicago", "ReviewID": "UR121605888", "Content": "First of all, the lobby decor is better than the suites.

We booked a room on priceline and were given a bay room, which is a motel style room. Upon getting to our room, we found a member of the service staff inside who said he had just replaced some kind of filter. The room smelled of powerful organic solvents. I'm a biochemist and I couldn't place the smell, but it was awful and headache inducing. Not to mention, the bathtub was more or less rotting out of the floor. We requested a new room and were given another bay room. This room smelled fine but was close to the hotel entrance and some of the bedding was ripped. My girlfriend and I looked at each other and just knew this would not be a relaxing situation for our weekend away. Both of the rooms we saw needed a total facelift. So we returned to the lobby for the third time, and I paid to upgrade to a tower room. I'd still say the tower room we got needed a little work (as far as cleaning) but it was so much better than the bay rooms. Plus, it had an awesome view, which distracts you from any other minor details (for example all of the dead bugs in the overhead light panel in the bathroom, or the ridiculously dirty patio furniture). The upgrade was well worth the price, I guess, but the thing is that when you go to a Hyatt, you just don't expect to see the kind of low quality rooms you find in the bay buildings (there are two of them). Additionally, you have to pay $20 per night for self parking. Yuck. I explained to one of the front desk personnel that the bay rooms I saw weren't consistent with Hyatt hotel quality.

While the hotel itself is nice enough, it was the staff reaction to a noisy neighbour that took from our stay a little. We had been checked into a room in Bay 2 which was ok but had an adjoining door to the next room to cater for families. This was locked when the rooms were sold separately. Two days before the end of our stay, what I can only describe as a number of neandertals moved in next door. As the door was not soundproofed we could here every word they said aswell as various other unidentified bodily sounds. I called down to the night manager to inform him of the situation and he was quite helpful offering to do it straight away. I declined as my girlfriend had miraculously fallen asleep but asked if we could move first thing in the morning. He provided us with some earplugs, said he would inform the day manager and it would not be a problem. The next morning I arrived down and found myself having to explain the situation again to the girl at the desk who offered me an upgrade for $50. I asked her why should I have to pay extra to move room when I just wanted a decent nights sleep? We would've been happy to stay where we were had the Beverly Hillbillies next door vacated the premises. She had to adjourn to the back with her manager who hadn't got the decency to come and talk to me face to face. Eventually with a delivery that should have led me to believe Moses had once again parted the Red Sea, the girl returned to announce \" We are prepared to offer you a complimentary upgrade\". Why thank you. The whole debacle took over an hour when it should have taken only a few minutes. The hotel seems to only want to cater for those whom money is not an issue to and preferably own a yacht. Upon check-in the girl asked if she could put a $450 hold on my credit card, when I asked why she quickly amended this to $200.????? Ate at the swim bar one evening and paid $60 for two average burgers and some wings. $6.95 for 15 minutes internet access, come on, what kind of a resort charges that? Surely it wouldn't kill them to provide complimentary access. If you like seafood, try Sportmans Seafood across the car park, doesn't look much from the outside but is good for some lunch.

On arrival at the room, we found it to be dirty with wet cleaning cloth's on the floor and table, the bedding had holes in it, some of the towels had obviously been used and then put back on the towel holder.

My wife and I have stayed at many Hyatt resorts and the furniture was consistent with the Hyatt style. The grounds were very nice and we walked them almost every morning with coffee. We had a nice (but small) balcony on the 3rd floor of the suites building. The view was very nice overlooking the boardwalk and marina. For anyone in the suites....yes the sea lions do bark, yes you can hear them in the suites and YES THEY DO THIS ALL NIGHT LONG! Lucky for us, we're not light sleepers, but there were a few nights we woke up in the middle of the night from our lovely 2yr old's kicking and could still hear the barks. Belmont Park and Mission Beach IS, let me repeat that IS in walking distance and can easily be walked to. Anyone who is posting that it's impossible to walk to or it's too far is BEING LAZY! It's about a mile away and it's a very scenic and relaxing walk. You will need a car to get around and do other things such as going to Garnett and Mission Blvd where you'll find a majority of the bars, restaurants and shops. Also, you will need a car or taxi to get to SeaWorld. BE ADVISED-if you are getting the GoSanDiego cards (which were amazing and I highly recommend) you cannot take the water taxi from the hotel. This is because the water taxi goes to the back entrance of Seaworld where you have to present the actual paper ticket. Well with the GoSanDiego Cards you have to go to the ticket counter, present your card and then get the paper ticket...not possible to do with the water taxi as there is no ticket counter at the back entrance. The food...the only food purchased from the hotel restaurants were bagels one morning from Einsteins and coffee daily (need it to function). We did not try the Red Marlin, we thought about ordering from SWIM the poolside place, but the prices were honestly ridiculous. I recommend going around and trying local eateries and restaurants, this worked out well for us. If you find yourself in the Carlsbad area...LOOK UP ANGELOS BURGERS...OMG!!!! The most amazing place ever, tons of food, great value and absolutely delicious! Weeks later and we're still talking about Angelos. They have different chains we went to one in Oceanside and one in Irvine. Other than that...staff was okay, didn't interact with them much. The kids loved the movie night, but we got our own smores ingredients from the Ralph's supermarket on MIssion Blvd. The kids loved, loved, loved the waterslides...perfect for all three of them ages 2(almost 3), 8 &10. BTW, we got parking for free. We checked in late (around 12:30am) and I didn't want to pay $20 for parking so I mentioned to my wife in front of the guy at the check in counter that I'll just park in the street and carry the bags, well he offered to cover our parking for us for the whole stay....GREAT! It is a nice hotel, there is quite a bit of nickel and diming but you don't HAVE to spend the extra money if you choose not to.

You can see the ocean, the marina with boats, AND the fireworks from Sea World every night at 9:50pm. Request a high floor. The grounds are perfect if you are with little kids. There are little nooks where you can hang out and read and the kids can run around safely. The pool is also perfect for kids; especially the water slide. The big fire pit was fantastic at nights and my boys loved making their first Smores! Red Marlin is great - amazing food, decor, service, and they know how to treat families with young children. The $5 per adult boat ride to Sea World is a MUST (The hotel has its own boat that takes you there). First of all, that alone is an experience for the kids. Secondly, you get a VIP back door entrance and avoid the crowds. Note that you have to have pre-purchased Sea World tickets though to get in through that entrance.

The hotel is quite remote- there is not much right there if you like to walk to several options to eat, etc. Take a drive to Mission Beach- it's very close! Pool- water slides were great- there is a tiny one for all ages but the two larger ones were 42 inches and they are strict on it. My 3 year old was disappointed he couldn't get on there. Older kids seemed to be having a blast and there was one organized race/activity for them during the day. However, the pool was freezing in the middle of August. It really needs a heater. Unless your child is a bit older and will stay in no matter how cold it is - we spent more time in a very crowded hot tub. The staff said it was like this all of the time- and this was pretty calm. I expected to spend a lot more time at the pool. Also- there's a ridiculously small number of lounge chairs at the hotel. We were offered folding chairs two days. Annoyingly, some people would leave an item on a chair but be gone for 3/4 of the day to reserve for later. Food- HIGHLY recommend the fish & chips at the restaurant just before the hotel- I believe it's called the Sportsmen Lounge. Fish tacos just ok. Cheap beer, etc. compared to the hotel and if staying in the suites- very close. We ate at Sweim once- which was just ok- kids liked the fish tank. Smores kits were a lot of fun- are for purchase f $20 - last about 2 nights- or bring your own if you plan ahead. Rooms- we only entered the lobby/main part of the hotel once after checking in- the suites are quite remote. It seemed like they just bought a motel next door and redid it. We didn't really like it. There was strange club music as you walk into the unmanned lobby- which required a room key. It was the awkward- do you hold the door open for someone coming- but wanting to be sure they were staying here. The rooms were nice enough- separate bedroom- small hallway w/bathroom btwn bedroom and living room with pocket doors. You can hear people walking along the marina early in the morning so plan to be an early riser. They really should have tile floors throughout- as the carpeting always seemed slightly damp- especially if sliding door was left open.

However the biggest issue I have with this hotel is the fact that although I had pre-paid for my accommodation in full via British Airways 8 months in advance of arriving at the hotel I was staggered to find that upon checking my Bank Account when i returned home to England that the Hyatt had deducted the full amount for the 7 night stay again from my bank account!

San Diego, however, is like Times Square at New Years so you need to plan ahead to find a decent hotel, condo, timeshare, etc. We decided last minute to drive over for one last beach trip before school starts so finding a decent place to stay near the ocean was not easy. Unless you can stay near the beach, it's dumb to go...why drive 6 hours to the beach if you have to stay inland? I looked at every condo rental site and all the beachfront hotels from Coronado to Carlsbad and there were just 2 or 3 available for 5 days in late July. I decided on this hotel because of its great location and have not been disappointed about that. A $5 water taxi ride took us to Sea World yesterday and we avoided the crowd and parking nightmare by coming in \"the back door\". Our ticket is good for consecutive days so we ran around the park in the morning doing all the rides and when the weekend crowd swelled, we took our water taxi back to the hotel and spent the rest of the afternoon at the beach. We plan to do the same tomorrow. The pool at the hotel, however, is in some sort of wind tunnel so the pool was not fun for the kids nor for us...it's the strangest thing. The first room they put us in was looking over a roof and air con unit...totally unacceptable...so I paid for an upgrade and we're now on the 17th floor, Concierge level, which is fabulous.

And the service is slightly inept - our used towels were removed, but not replaced! My pajamas, which I had left under the pillow were tossed on the floor. Even more disturbing, we found a child's drawing by the bed on day 4 of our stay: we don't have children. Either someone else accessed our room, or it was left by the previous occupants of the room, and housekeeping failed to find it for 4 days.

Let me be clear though that the staff at the hotel had nothing to do with our bad stay. Check in was fantastic, staff in the SWIM lounge, even housekeeping were all wonderful, my choice to stay elsewhere would be based on room condition. We chose to stay in a suite overlooking the marina. The room description really seemed to suit our needs and we knew that a suite would offer the space we needed for 2 adults and 2 kids. DO NOT stay in a marina front sutie. Upon entering the room you step into the \"living room\" where there is an L-shaped pull out bed couch, a sitting chair, and a table with a TV. The couch was DISGUSTING!!!! Food stains all over it, smears of who knows what, torn throw pillows. The magazine rack on the side of the lounge chair had travel guides etc that were COVERED in GREASE! The carpet was stained and there were black scuff marks all over the walls. NEXT: The actual bedroom was better. Big enough for space, however the beds were awful, the furniture was broken, or cracked, and dusty. The sliding door out to the balcony was covered in fingerprints. The balcony view was beautiful with the boats and the bay right outside. However, the furniture on the balcony was gross. Stained cushions again, and cracked wood. BATHROOM: Make sure you bring your flipflops or water shoes! The tub was ridiculous! The enitre inside of the bathtub was stripped of paint, yet the sides had the remaining paint. Almost like someone tried to peel the paint off but couldn't do it. There was flaking paint ALL OVER the tub. Everytime one of us got out we had paint chips on our feet! GROSS! Almost like how a person with peeling skin from a sunburn would look. I was so sad. Yes, the pool area is nice which is probably because it is the only thing that has been updated in a long time. Not a 4 star quality. I hated going back every night and we were there for 5 days.

The property itself was fine and located close to Sea World and Mission Beach area. Our adjoining rooms were located in the lobby building, not the tower. The kids enjoyed the heated pool and water slides. Our check-in experience was terrible. We arrived at 2:30pm and were informed that our rooms were not ready which was understandable since check-in is actually 4:00pm. We were issued a temporary pool key so that we could \"enjoy the property\" while waiting - even though our luggage had been taken away so we had no access to bathing suits or a place to change into them, leaving the bar or restaurant as our only real options for kililng time onsite. Long story short, we were only able to access one of the rooms by 5:30pm - after a 3 hour wait during which staff could not provide any estimate of when the rooms may be ready. After complaining to the manager we were finally offered a $75 credit to spend at the property and 3 entree vouchers for the SWIM pool bar (when I pointed out that $75 would not go far with our party of 6 after seeing the menu prices). We did use the entree vouchers later in the week and the 3 beers, 3 Shirley Temples, a kids meal and dozen hot wings that we were billed for used $47 of that credit. We used the concierge service to arrange tickets for the Old Town Trolley Tour which also provides shuttle service to the hotel, for a van taxi to Sea World, and to arrange a rental car on our last day and they were helpful. Otherwise, we made our own arrangements as much as possible. Side note: our van taxi driver Fran (US Cab) was fantastic. We called him direct for transportation the remainder of the week and it felt like we had our own personal driver. He happily stopped by a store so that we could pick up a few items on the way back from Sea World and also took us by the hotel and waited for our son to change out of wet clothes when going from Sea World to dinner another day.

Though there are balconies in these rooms, our neighbors smoked in the room - the staff did what they could to address the problem, but ultimately it wasn't in their power to make their guests stop smoking. As far as we were concerned, however, it made for an unfortunate stay. The smoke was bad because our rooms shared a door, and so was the noise. The fitness facilities were great - replete with a lovely view of the marina. The pool was nice, too. Not much in the way of eating or nightlife here - if you don't have a rental car, you'll need taxis. We ended up moving downtown on our last night in San Diego, and I'm so glad we did. The Hyatt has sorely disappointed me in my last couple of stays at a number of their branches.

The room, including the bathroom, seemed a little tired and vaguely dirty; the lampshade was stained and dusty, and the grout in the bathroom needed some serious work. I could hear every word of the conversations between the woman and man staying in the room next to ours -- very thin walls. Housekeeping didn't do a great job -- at one point it was very clear the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. Check-in on our first day and valet parking on every day took a considerable amount of time because of lack of staff. And the concierge I spoke with twice for recommendations seemed supremely annoyed with my questions for restaurant recommendations and zoo information, as if I were bothering him, not to mention that he professed no personal experience with any of the restaurants he was recommending. At one point I was waiting at the desk to speak with him (he was away from the desk for several minutes), and a male hotel guest was waiting behind me, and when the concierge arrived back at the desk he assisted the male hotel guest first. Even my 12-year-old son was astonished. On the other hand, the employees at the Red Marlin restaurant where we had breakfast three mornings were very friendly and accommodating. And although a spa visit was somewhat mediocre, the employees there were also friendly and professional, and the manager who oversees the spa and the pool area was an admirable representative of the hotel -- very visible, and working very hard. However, my son went to the gift shop at one point and the employee was lying on the floor behind the counter ... taking a nap?

Our boys (age 6 and 11) loved the pools and the waterslides. The pool with the 2 big slides is nice and warm, as is the larger saline pool. The pool with the little slide is not heated - brr! Hot tub is great. There is poolside drink and food service from Swim on the property. Our AAA rate also came with complimentary breakfast and free parking. The breakfast was at the Red Marlin which is the property's nice restaurant, and the buffet was quite good. Read the fine print because we didn't understand that the free parking was for self-parking only... not free valet parking. But their valet staff was very helpful and even put air in our rental car tire when a warning light came on. There was a problem with our queen suite but after quite a wait, they were able to give us a king suite and comped us an adjoining king room which were great. Good water pressure in showers, all staff were very friendly and professional, good spa experience, clean and roomy. Loved the bagel/espresso place on property too.

The pools were heated, not too full of people, and open until 11pm. There were 3 water slides running nearer the weekend.

The hotel staff proved friendly and very informative about their city and sights to see. The front desk staff, the consierge, and Regency Club 'cafe' staff were all so helpful, easy to approach, and were willing to assist regardless of the time of day. It's worth it to pay a little extra each day (I think maybe $10) and get the Regency Club service. With your hotel key, this enables you to get a continental breakfast in the hotel each morning, which was more than enough to help start your day. Also bottled water, coffee, pop etc. was on hand. Then appy's at supper, and dessert each night too. It pays because there's not many restaurants near the hotel. We used public transit a lot during our week stay.

We are active vacationers and appreciated being able to get anywhere quickly. San Diego is an easy town to get around and we never had traffic issues. The property - we were very pleased. It had the resort feeling which was great if you are looking to relax. The grounds are very well kept, lots of plants and greenspace. The pools appeared to be a lot of fun - we did not partake. The marina with all of the boats is a great sight. We stayed in the tower in a club room on the 16th floor and loved it. Pretty view and a nice terrace, clean, updated room. The room was a great size and we enjoyed the access to the Regency Club (which has a dynamite view). The service was outstanding - all of the valets and front desk folks were great. The housekeeping staff was so friendly when we'd pass them which is such a nice touch. We worked with Nur in the concierge who was excellent. The only (slight) downside is that the parking can get dicey if you return in the evenings after 10 or 11.

We used the concierge shuttle once and were extremely pleased with the vehicle - clean, easy to seat 4+, driver was super nice. The concierge was also helpful for their recommendation of a place for dinner. This hotel is older but ownership has attempted to refresh the property. The lobby definately looks great but the rooms didn't quite get the same attention. The rooms are good but not great. The bathrooms are unnecessarily small as there was room to expand them during renovations. The shower head was installed for a very short person as the head is placed about 5 ft high. The pillows are not king sized - not a huge deal but are comfortable. Tv is smaller than other Hyatt's I stay at. there is a fridge in the room which is nice touch. The pools are decent and have water slides the kids like a lot. This hyatt gives the impression that they are kid friendly but sends mixed signals - ie. the kids are forbidden ( and the staff will remind you - way too strict and for no good reason in my opinion. Maybe after 8pm but not 5pm) from the regency club starting at 5 pm and they advertise s'mores being available via TV and signs but when we inquired we were told it was $8 per 'kit' that you use on your own. Really?!? At other properties such as: lost pines & hill country this experience is included as a part of the overall experience and is managed on by the staff. It is a great experience and is cheap to host. The regency club is just 'ok'. There is not an automatic coffee machine as there is in every other RC Club I visit and we ran out of coffee this morning. The food selection is average to below average compared to other hyatts. Another patron shared my views about regency club in a conversation we had this morning while waiting for the coffee to be replenished. The spa is nothing special and not on par with other hyatt spa's. We did not use it this trip but I did on a previous stay and thought it was worth mentioning here. Overall, I think this hyatt is just 'ok' and I really don't see coming back with my family or on business again because there are some other great Hyatt's nearby.

I was down in San Diego for a girls weekend with my mom, it was her Christmas present. I was impressed with the lobby and couldn't wait to get to our room. I was somewhat disappointed by our room. It smelled a little musty and the bathroom wasn\u2019t clean and some of the lights weren\u2019t working in the bathroom. We turned on the A/C unit in the room while we checked out the pool and hotel grounds. We came back to the room and noticed the musty smell just wouldn\u2019t go away and the A/C unit was broken. I went down to the lobby and mentioned it and they said they would send us a repair man shortly. We went out for the rest of the day and came back late that evening. When you stay at this hotel you have to choose between valet ($25) or self-serve parking ($20). We decided to do self-serve as we don\u2019t mind walking, however what they don\u2019t tell you is that there are not enough self-serve spaces for everyone staying at the hotel. After looking for 20 minutes one evening, we finally had to park in the street super far from the hotel. Since it was very late and we were two women, I didn\u2019t feel that safe. We were still charged $20 for parking that night even though I told the lobby attendant there was no parking in the lot and we did not end up parking there. That is ridiculous! When we got back to the room we noticed the A/C unit was still not fixed. I again went to the lobby (annoyed) and told this person that our A/C unit was down and it was supposedly already fixed. He didn\u2019t offer to change our room or anything. He ordered another maintenance person to fix the unit at almost 1am. We were so annoyed. The repair man fixed the unit fairly quickly and we went to bed. However, after the parking issue, bathroom dirtiness, and A/C unit issue I couldn\u2019t wait to leave. The bathroom when we arrived had several little hairs still in the tub and the sink was that well cleaned. Also, they don\u2019t inform you that the pillows and duvets are down. My mom is severely allergic to down and couldn\u2019t stop sneezing. Nowhere in the documentation in the room does it say what the duvets or pillows are filled with. We finally had to pull them out to figure out they were filled with down. They should have a card stating what it is. Another issue we had was with the noise in the hallway. We could hear everything that was going on, including a running child up and down the hallway at 7am as well as the cleaning carts at 8am.

From the time we walked up to the front desk it was disaster. First of all the young lady named Bekka greeted us as though it was painful for her to do so. And when we gave her the confirmation number she said we were only booked for 1 night. I had explained to her that we were booked for 2 nights originally through SW and added an extra night. She made calls and could not find anything but had said we were ok for 3 nights. She did not let us know anything about the Hotel or what the Hotel had to offer and did not even offer us what had come with the 3rd night stay ( a movie and 25% off meal in their restaurant and free parking). She has no buisness in the hospitality buisness because she lacked hospitable skills. Then we get to our room. Where do I start? The roomed smelled obnoxious because of the deodorizer the housekeeper used to cover the smells of the musky room, we had to pay for internet service and pay for cartoons on televsion for our daughter (this is unheard of to me),on the balcony was bird droppings from birds pirching over the balcony with no chairs on the balcony to sit. Parking is also 20.00 a day. We were paying almost $300.00 a night. The upgrades in this hotel are tacky and cheap looking. Very cold staff and very cold stay. Needless to say, we cancelled the original 2 night vactaion package through Sea World with the Hyatt and stayed only 1 night. We booked the remaining 2 night stay with Hilton San Diego Resort and Spa up the street. My gut did try to warn me as I was booking this trip to stay with Hilton where we have only got the BEST service in all our visits with Hilton. I I have to mention that we are disappointed with Sea World as far as not even getting an apology for the waste of money and time Hyatt Regency Mission Bay caused and cost us.

I would highly recommend getting an upper floor in the tower to avoid street and other noises from the marina. We also brought our daughter's sound machine to drown out noises we may have heard. We really didn't need it that high up, but she's used to it so it did help. Our bed was soooo comfortable! The pillows were plush and plentiful. We didn't rent a car and just used taxis which are plentiful outside the front desk. I believe the hotel charges $25 a night to park. It was $6 to Seaworld and $25 to the zoo. They offer free shuttle service to and from Mission Bay Beach which is less than a mile from the hotel. We went during the off-season which was great when visiting Seaworld and the zoo. It was also nice because the hotel was not crowded and loud and we still had nice weather. The concierge was extremely helpful and friendly. They recommended restaurants for us and knew the cab fare to each place we wanted to visit. We ate at Swim one night which is a bar/restaurant poolside and the food was fantastic. It was a little pricey ($14 for a burger) but the quality was wonderful. The fish tacos were excellent as well as the kids meals. Each morning we ate at Einstein Bros. Bagels and sat on the marina. The bagels and bagel sandwiches were very good and seemed to fill us up. We just loved sitting out on our balcony and looking out at the city. We enjoyed walking around the grounds of the hotel because they were absolutely beautiful. Our 3 year old thought she was on a safari! The pools were heated and very fun with the waterslides. They also didn't charge for towel service, maybe because it was in October and not many guests. If you are traveling to San Diego, going during the off-season was great since they always have great weather. It's nice to avoid the crowds.

Check-in was a lengthy process, even though they were not that busy. The desk clerk was friendly, just slow. The bell hops and valet guys were very nice. They gave us great info on things like where to eat, and what time the fireworks display was every night. (You can see Sea World's fireworks show from the property.) Our room was in one of the two \"Bays\", which are two-story buildings with several rooms in them. Our second floor room was small and cramped. There was little room to move around with the two queen beds, dresser, nightstand, desk and bench. The bathroom was a bit better. It was standard, except the long countertop, which was nice. Although the rooms were \"newly designed\" and furnished, they were not as clean as I expected. The carpet felt sticky, there were dust bunnies in the corners, and the bath tub was stained and dirty looking. Not quite the standard I expect from Hyatt Regency. Unfortunately, one of our kids got sick and we needed clean sheets for one of the beds. I called and requested a full set with blankets and pillowcases, and was told they would be sent to us. It took about 40 minutes for the stuff to be delivered, and when it arrived, it was 3 sheets, no blanket, no pillowcases. So I had to wait again for the pillowcases and blanket. Finally, the pillowcases arrived, but we never did get a blanket. The other disappointment was the lack of a balcony off of our room. The grounds of this resort are beautiful. Generous landscaping lends it a lush, tropical feel. The pools were nice, and had small slides that my kids enjoyed. One of the pools also had a zero-entry which is great for my one-year old to splash and play in. We also enjoyed the cabanas with sofas that were available. It was nice to sit in them at night, relax and enjoy the fire. There is a restaurant on site. My husband ate lunch there and said it was just okay. Overall, this resort hotel was okay. The grounds were very nice, but the rooms were lacking. I expect cleaner, larger rooms for the amount of money we spent.

We wanted a place that felt fun and leisurely but also a little sophisticated - to give ourselves a little treat. We feel like we found just the right place. All is not perfect, but on balance, we had a great time and were pleased with the service. The hotel is perfectly located. We traveled around the area each of the 7 days we stayed and all trips were less than 30 minutes. Can't find a comparison in Chicago where we came. Longest trip was to Legoland at about 35 minutes. Our first night was lackluster. We reserved a waterfront suite, but found the room a little less than we hoped for, but a trip to the main desk yielded us a really nice junior suite room in the main tower for the remainder of our stay. No questions asked. I can't say enough about the staff that work in the resort. You can't pass a single person without that person saying hello or striking up a conversation. The people are fantastic. The Red Marlin restaurant is great. The SWIM bar at the pool is nice. The hotel showed movies at the pool the first night we were there and had activities for kids each day. The pool was never overcrowded, but always full of kids. This is a great place for parents that want a little pampering, while the kids feel like they're the center of attention. I'm not thrilled with the fact that everything has a hefty price tag. Parking costs $20 per day - going green foregoing a car is a good thing here. Red Marlin is not cheap. The dinner's seemed worthwhile to me, but the $20 breakfast buffet is a stretch. Snow cones for the kids at the pool - which seemed like a free treat - cost $5. A kit for making Smores over the open fire pits at the pool costs $8. None of these things are outrageous for a short trip, but on a 7 day stay, you're constantly reminded of the credit card bill. How about costs that decrease based upon the length of time that you stay at the hotel? In total, the environment, the location, and the people made this a great stay. It costs money to keep a complex like this going and we chose this place knowing that it would cost us more. I still kind of resent the feeling of being nickled and dimed while there, but our family had a great trip and were happy to arrive back at the hotel each night. We felt safe, clean, and happy. You don't always get that when arriving in a city for the first time. I'd recommend the stay. I'd also recommend a Junior Suite in the tower facing the marina.

I read every review on here, deciding to ignore the negatives, and just book, and I am so glad I did! Such a relaxing stay! It was perfect for our family vacation for our 3 and 6 year old boys, and I would also stay here if we were traveling without the kids. The grounds are beautiful, the staff is amazing, the rooms clean and relaxing, the food delicious, and the location perfect. We agonized over whether to stay in La Jolla, Coronado Island, or the Mission Bay area, and feel we made a great choice. The water ferry back and forth from Sea World was fun and convenient. We could go to the park for an hour, or the whole day, through an easy back gate into the park. (makes you feel like part of the staff ) We loved watching the boats in the bay, and the sea lions frolicking in the water, and on the docks, from our 15th floor balcony. We've been home for days and still miss the sound of their barking. We also had the perfect view of the nightly Sea World fireworks. The weather was pretty cool (mid 60's) that week, but coming from 100 degree Dallas, TX heat, we didn't mind so much, and it didn't stop our boys from having a BLAST on the water slides. We only wish the slides opened earlier, since my husband and the boys would have loved to do that while mom primped and got ready for the day, before breakfast. Speaking of breakfast, one of our favorite parts of every day was the delicious, relaxing breakfast buffet. Located in the Red Marlin restaurant, sitting over the water in the marina, with beautiful views from every table, it was the perfect start to every day of theme parks, and sight seeing. The staff were infectiously friendly and attentive, and the food was really delicious. Lots of healthy choices, along with yummy pastries and treats, since it is vacation after all. We highly recommend making this part of your stay package...very worth it. We filled up so well, that it allowed us keep our lunches light. The restaurant at the pool, Swim, was also delicious. Definitely take advantage of that. The boys loved sitting by the beautiful aquarium, and the fish tacos are delish. So are the veggie sandwich, and quesadillas. Also, the smores kit you can purchase through the concierge to use at the firepits at night is a must. So fun. I have to end with this example of how wonderful the staff at this hotel is. On our last full day at the hotel, our three year old woke up with a stomach virus. He was extremely ill. We called the front desk mid morning, to request some new linens. A security guard and maid came to our room, to dispose of and change all the linens. They were so sweet to our little boy, and I was impressed with the thoroughness in which they cleaned the room. Very reassuring. We left for a walk that evening when he was feeling better, and returned to our room to find a basket FULL of goodies, and several bottled waters and sodas, and a sweet hand-written card from Keith, the security guard, addressing our son by name, telling him he hoped he felt better, with a gift certificate to purchase a movie through the hotel. It was so thoughtful, and special. I realize I sound like Suzy Sunshine, but I truly can't think of any negatives about this hotel, aside from the price of parking and the hours the slides are open.

I was apprehensive about staying here after reading some of the reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. We stayed on the 12th floor of the Tower Building and had a view of the marina. The room was clean and tidy. The bathroom was updated and was simple but clean. The view was great and the housekeepers were pleasant and helpful. I heard from others we met there that the rooms that have an \"odor\" as listed in previous postings are in the Bay I and Bay II buildings. The Tower building was fine. We ate dinner one night at the Red Marlin restaurant.The meal was pricey but the food and service were excellent. The Sea World water taxi was great. It cost $5.00 per person R/T and was great to avoid waiting in line at the gates and the parking lot. The pools were nice however I was disappointed that all of the waterslides close at 6:00pm. It was way to early in my opinion. The weather was unseasonably chilly while we were there ( low 60's) so the pool temp. could have been turned up a bit. We spent more time in the hot tub than the pool. My only negatives for the hotel are signing out pool towels with a 25.00 per towel deposit. For a hotel of this caliber, we shouldn't need to sign out towels. If ther has been a problem with missing towels, then provide more staff to monitor. Don't make it into a YMCA towel system. This was an issue because my kids went down to the pool first while I got changed and couldn't receive a towel until I came down with the pool cards for our room. Also, Einstein Bagels stops serving at 12:00 noon which really limited your food choices to the expensive pool bar or the expensive Red Marlin restaurant. Also, it is advertised that the beach is within walking distance. It is not! You need to drive to MIssion Beach. I'm a walker , but it is too far to go when you are carrying things with your family. I found this to be very misleading on the hotel website. $25.00 for parking was also ridiculous in my opinion.

Mini coolers instead of refrigerators. No light in the closet The service was very poor. There was always a line for the concierge and the front desk. They weren't even very helpful. They ran out of towels at the pool. Towels that you had to \"pay\" for and then get credit back. The pools were freezing. It was overcast and in the 60's all week. They knew that so why not heat at least one of the pools. The first day the waiter didn't tell us there was a kid's menu at the pool so we ended up getting all of them adult meals. Everything costs extra. Parking $25 a day. Wifi. (seriously?) Pool towels (ridiculous!) The absolute worst was when my one year old shut the adjoining door & was locked in one of the rooms by himself with the chain on the front door.

It was 65 and cloudy but that's not to blame on the hotel, I will still rate them accurately. We found the hotel to be very good for what we needed. Here are some things I wish I knew LOCATION: if you're looking to see the San Diego area it is a great location to do so. You will have to drive everywhere but that is expected. Most sites (Coronado, Gas Lamp, La Jolla) were within a 15-20 minute drive. The hotel is situated on a Marina and you can walk around and view the boats/etc. PARKING: expensive for what seemed to be plenty of parking availability. It was $20/day to self-park, $25 to valet. I would recommend the self-parking as none of the parking lots were too far away to walk yourself. BEACHES: It is situated on a Marina so you cannot swin in the ocean there but Pacific Beach is the closet beach (10 minute drive). I would recommend a longer drive to Coronado Beach- much nicer. POOL: Due to the aforementioned weather we did not get to take advantage of the pool. It looked great for kids, not so great for a young couple looking to enjoy a romantic swim. There are 3 waterslides but as this hotel is situated next to Sea World it is infested with kids TOWELS: upon check-in you can ask for towel cards (as many as you like) that you will be responsible for returning when checking out. Basically if you lose the card or the towel you pay $25. The towels are better than the typical pool towel but not worth 25 bucks. ROOMS: There are two different rooms types to pay attention to when booking. The Bay rooms are small one story rooms that basically have a bed and bathroom, not much room for anything else. They have decks but no view of the ocean. With the hotel being situated on Mission Bay I would recommend upgrading to an ocean view in the tower (2nd room type). These rooms are spacious and have a breathtaking view of the Marina or Ocean. We chose the ocean and were on the 10th floor which enabled us to see for miles. It's worth it. We also stayed in a corner Junior Suite which was incredibly nice but probably bigger than what we needed. FOOD: We only ate at the \"Swim Lounge\" which is fine for chips and dip or a sandwhich but not much else. It is also a lot smaller than the pictures lead you to believe. SERVICE: Other than checking in and speaking with the concierge a few times on the phone we never had to deal with the hotel staff.

We were given room vouchers and it took many phone calls to finally make a reservation. The room we were initially given was not satisfactory and I was downstairs in the lobby to check on a room change immediately! They were doing work on the side of the building involving gardening and all I could hear was the sound of heavy equipment. We were moved to the tower building on the 4th floor facing the pool. While a bit loud, it was decorated much nicer and was a much larger room. Beds very comfortable. Staff very helpful- we never left the parking area without offers of maps and directions. Only sour note, we were over charged at the bar. We were charged for 3 drinks each when we only had 2. The bar area had lava rocks and a fire each night that was very cozy.

We complained and I also told them as a gold passport member I always get the uppper floors and pay for it so using my \"points\" gets me a lower quality room. I got to the 15th floor... but wait my profile also states not to be near the elevator -- who wants to hear that all night -- so they moved us again - to room 1101 -- a Jr Suite -- that looks nothing like the other suite.

We had a nice time there, it was a good homebase to explore the San Diego area. Basically, you will get everything to expect from an upscale chain hotel like the Hyatt - and maybe a little bit more as well in positive aspects as in not-so-positive aspects. We had a waterfront suite; which seems to be their premium room type (living room & bedroom, separate building, attached to the marina). So the 'ups' first: Loads of space, nicely 'redecorated' as a former reviewer wrote. We experienced a good service, all the staff where friendly and helpful. Location is almost walking distance to SeaWorld and Mission Beach. To say it clear: I would recommend this hotel as long as you get a good rate on it and probably return myself. I haven't seen the other rooms but the little extra money for the waterfront suite seemed well-invested. There are some minor issues I would like to share with you that actually keep me from giving this hotel a higher ranking: * Noise: The hotel is in the airport flight path, so you have frequent noise due to coming and leaving planes. That itself is not really disturbing. But with marina & promenade next door und many party people around it simply adds up. Just be prepared on that, it is nothing the hotel can do anything about. * Parking: Parking on the hotel grounds (we are talking about self parking) will cost some money (20$ a day). That is a little downturn for me personally since it is not a city hotel. Even with that money taken, the parking lot before the suite building was almost always crowded. * Buildings: The buildings itself and some of the basic furniture itself are rather old. Even though beeing redecorated, you can see the time gone by in the rooms and furniture. * No complimentary internet (but a reasonable price in the rooms) Finally, the balcony of our suite was quite small and had no chairs on it. That's not so nice at all. On the higher floors of the Tower you might actually have a better view view, a bigger balcony and some equipment. All in all these minor issues did not spoil our vacation in any way. We had a good time at the Hyatt and I would return for another San Diego pitstop!", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cFinally......a Hyatt that gets Customer Service Right\u201d", "Author": "Manico", "ReviewID": "UR68972150", "Content": "I had previously stayed at this hotel last year when they were in the midst of their renovation but decided to come back after the renovation was complete due to a points offer for GoldPassport members. My previous experience was okay with just middling service from the staff and nicely redecorated rooms that were comfortable but not spectacular. Both times I received a \"partial\" ocean view or \"Marina\" view I think is what they call it. As others have said the pool area is nice but definitely meant for families and kids. There is a nice bar area near the pool and a highly rated restaurant (Red Marlin) on the grounds but I never took advantage of them due to the price. If you feel up to walking, Mission Beach is about a 20-30 minute walk west of the hotel (or 5 minute drive) where you'll find plenty of restaurants and nightlife (parking is difficult there so I usually walk---besides, you've already paid $20). There is also a seafood restaurant next door that has more reasonable prices but is also more \"divey\" looking. Rooms are comfortable with the Hyatt Grand Bed but beware if you're a light sleeper with a marina-facing room as on both occasions I was able to hear the seals barking even at night. My biggest surprise here though was the massive improvement in customer service. I'm not sure if they got a new GM or just better training but I was very impressed with the friendliness, smiles and genuine willingness to help provided by the staff. At check-in, I chatted with a nice young lady who genuinely seemed to be happy to be working there. If you've ever stayed at the Hyatt in Irvine or Orange County, you'll see a marked difference in the staff (especially among the sour/dour Irvine staff). Even when passing by maint. or housekeeping staff, they acknowledge you and smile and sometimes joke with you making you feel at home and relaxed. I only wish that Hyatt would transfer this to most of their other properties as this is what customer service should be for this level of a hotel.

Here are the details and some advice Advice: consider booking from the hotel's website. We did, and found the cheapest rate of all the sites we checked. The other benefit of doing so (rather than booking on Expedia or whatever) was that we were able to SELECT, rather than request a room type (like you do on Expedia). In this way, we selected a high floor tower room with an ocean view. When we arrived at the hotel, they didn't have a room that fit what we selected so it's my understanding that because of this we were upgraded to the Hyatt Gold Passport floor (or whatever it's called) which is the highest floor other than the penthouse floor. My other tip only applies to Costco members. If you are a Costco member you can get Hyatt gift certificates. You can buy cards in increments of $100.00, but you'll only pay $80.00. We used these certificates to pay most of our bill (for the hotel and food, etc.) saving us about 20%. If you get to the Hyatt and realize you've forgotten to do this, there's a Costco about 4 miles away. FYI: Please call to double check that they'll take the credit in case they've changed their policy! I don't want any mad Trip Advisor readers coming after me. On to the review Check In: Check in went smoothly (we were excited to be upgraded) Room: Our room was in good condition and had a fabulous view. The toilet gurgled occasionally throughout the night. Other than that, no issues. Staff: Wow! The customer service at this hotel was very nice. Everyone was very friendly and polite. I even got a book recommendation from the waitress at the pool who saw the novel I was reading and had some ideas for me. I also thought they handled the issue of not having the room we reserved ready really well. Good job Hyatt! Noise: Our room was really quiet; we couldn't hear anyone else in adjoining rooms. Resort Grounds/Pool: The grounds and pool were generally in good condition and very aesthetically pleasing. Even though the hotel was pretty full, we didn't have problems getting chairs by the pool. The hot tub was kind of dirty looking and bubbled ominously. We did not go in. Food: Wow. My husband and I both travel a fair amount (him moreso than me for business) and both of us though the SWIM bar (that's the pool food) was pretty good. We had dinner at the Red Marlin restaurant and it was absolutely fabulous, but pricey. As hotel restaurants go, this is one worth checking out. That being said, teir wine list was really polarizing: some good stuff but really pricey and some stuff which was inexpensive but pretty yuck. Other amenities, etc. The firepits outside were nice. I thought it was sweet that they brought around free popsicles at the pool (although I would have loved ice water dispensers or the distribution of iced water like they have at some Ritz Carlton properties. Sigh.) Some people have commented that this place nickles and dimes you on parking, pool towel charges (which are refundable, btw, so I don't get the problem) and other things. I priced around before booking and the Hyatt is just about even (and in some cases cheaper) than places like the Mariott and the Hilton (the Hilton is $25.00 to self park) which is just down the way. I think the prices seem reasonable _for a resort_. All in all, we had a good visit.

I was attending a conference being held at the hotel so it seemed like a good choice. It wasn't. First of all, this hotel boasts about a multi million dollar renovation. If this hotel had a multi million dollar renovation, they grossly overpaid. This is an old hotel and overall it looks like an old hotel that got a paint job. A lot about this hotel reminded me of a 1960's roadside motel. I believe that this hotel remodeled the guest rooms with a paint job, new bedding and new carpet but they need a lot more than that. The room looks okay at first glance and I liked the white bed linens with the green accents. All the other furniture looked old. The kicker was the rooms stink. Literally, they stink. My room smelled so musty and mildewy that I was worried everything I had would absorb the odor. I opened the windows, but since there are no screens, I then had to contend with bugs. I went to another conference attendee's room in another building and that room stunk as well. I heard the same comment from several people. Honestly, I have stayed in a lot of hotels and have never experienced a hotel room stinky like this. The bathroom was fine with a very long granite vanity and overall the room was clean. I stayed in Bay I (same building as the lobby) on the second floor. Rooms on the second floor of Bay I and Bay II do not have outdoor space. That is unless you call the open atrium area outside your door useful outdoor space. It's not. There is a real lack of attention to detail which when all those details are added up, it gives the feel of shabbiness. An example was that there was a wire was coming directly into the room through a hole in the wall for the heater/air conditioner and it was very visible since it was a few feet up the wall. The doors to the room had been painted inside and out, but it looked like they slapped paint over them and they looked shoddy. The walls of hotel are paper thin. Every sound traveled through the walls. I could hear everything in the room next door including the TV, the hairdryer and even talking and they weren't being loud. The hotel landscaping is quite lush and pretty. However, there is so much that as you try and navigate the pathways, it's hard to know where you are going sometimes. Note that the location of this hotel is not ideal unless you have a car as there is very little nearby and the choices at the hotel are limited.

The hotel itself is decorated to a very nice standard, in fact I was so impressed when I checked in that I commented on it to the lady behind reception and she noted that it had a complete refurbishment 18 months or so ago. The room it self was very nice after all the d\u00e9cor was only 18 months old so we had flat screen TV\u2019s and a sofa in the room as well as recliners and table out on the balcony which had amazing views over the bay and out over the ocean (sunsets were particularly nice). With all this in mind I kind of feel bad for adding anything negative however I have noticed from some of the reviews that people have mention: Noise \u2013 After a 6 hour drive from Las Vegas we arrived at around 11pm and were very tired and looking forward to a nights sleep. After we walked into our room we started to unwind and then realised that our room backed onto the elevator shaft and so every time someone got in the lift the noise from the mechanics would be coming through the wall. I went down and told them about it and we were promptly moved so no really complaints but I can empathise with people that have experienced this. Charges \u2013 I noticed some people complained about the charges that the hotel adds I had no need to wireless internet etc. So again I feel a little bad for mentioning it but on our first day we went to explore the hotel and found that they have some very nice gazebos that you can sit on in front of a fire by the pool area, after mentioning to the receptionist how nice they were she told us that they were available to hire by the hour, which seemed absurd. We off course just laughed it off and didn\u2019t both but I wondered if they were going to charge for the sun loungers while we were there? Pool \u2013 And finally some people have mentioned pool noise, again I don\u2019t really have any need to complain because we were on a high floor but the pool area gets very busy and noisy and so I can imagine if you are on a lower floor this could become disturbing. Overall this hotel was nice and the staff were very friendly and extremely accommodating however it appears that it depends on the luck of the draw. We were fortunate enough to have a high room away from the noise, however I can see how you could have a completely different experience to the one we had. If you do go for this hotel, just make sure you on a high floor and away from the lift and you will have a great stay, I\u2019m sure", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern California", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Location\u201d", "Author": "BigD_CA", "ReviewID": "UR56929474", "Content": "We arrived on a Monday night and were placed in a room located in a wing along the pier.

We ate one meal at the Red Marlin restaurant, which had great food and was accommodating to our picky eating kids. We also got some breakfast from the Einsteins bagel place which was packed and ran out of orange juice (not sure it was normally that crowded.)

We really did want to stay here because of the pool for the kids, and a 2nd call with another Hyatt rep solved the problem. She not only matched Expedia's offer, but knocked a further 20% off that rate! With the 5th night for free, we ended paying an average of 79$ per night for a deluxe room with ocean view on the 12th floor. Try to beat that!

The pool area with double water slides is fantastic for kids. Our's certainly enjoyed it and we didn't hear any of the other kids around complaining. Dinner in the Red Marlin restaurant is expensive, but service and food are great and you can enjoy nice views of the bay. We got our breakfast wraps and cappucino's from Einstein Bros on the pier just outside the hotel (but it also belongs to the Hyatt), which is good quality but also expensive. Any item in the hotel store, either souvenirs or a small bag of gummy bears, is ridiculously expensive, so you might want to do some shopping on the way there if you can.

We were \"upgraded\" to a \"suite\" which was a room with a see through curtain divider between the \"sleeping\" and living areas. The \"new\" sofa was filthy and stained. The bathroom was so tiny that you had difficulty closing the door, the shower head was for people 5 ft 8 and under, the paint was cracked around the windows and the blinds in the \"sleeping\" area did not fit the windows. I could go on but it is as though they ran out of funds during the \"remodel\". I have placed the word sleeping in quotes because, unless you are legally blind, that will be impossible. Inexplicably the blackout shades were only in the living area.

Okay. It was replaced by a real refrigerator within a 1/2 hour. We also encountered some problems with the air conditioning system but another call to the maitenance dept. fixed that. The other thing that was kind of annoying was that instead of the usual policy about towels, you know, they won't replace them unless you put them on the floor, etc. Well, here they will not replace them unless you call down to the front desk and request that they be replaced. It's kind of in fine print so you don't really realize this until your dirty towel that you put on the floor is placed back on the hook for you to use again!

We payed quite a lot for the room and it was not worth the money at all. We have stayed at many Hyatts in the past and this was the first time we were confronted with blinds with slats missing (so the room was well lit all night), the smell of cleaning fluid (and/or possibly bug spray), and very visible stains on the furniture. There were no screens on any of the windows or doors, and some flying insects did join us as a result. There was a sign near the fridge stating that there were 2 bottles of water in the fridge (such was not the case) and that if we used them there would be a charge of $4.99 each. Pretty pricey indeed. The first two rooms we were given had the definite feel of a budget motel and smelled terrible, and after complaining to the manager, we were given a different room. The third, while the best of the three, still would not be considered anywhere close to luxurious. The hotel is located near a busy street, so if you leave your windows open, it is noisy. Internet is not included in the room rate - which, given the room rate - is completely unacceptable. The room was a good size. As mentioned, we tried 3 rooms and, while the third had the mildest version, all had the same smell and ALL had stained furniture. Views were nice. We were not on the executive floor, so perhaps that is better. I note that some of the good reviews for this hotel were by people who stayed on the Regency floor. We chose to not eat at the hotel, and did not really use many of the amenities, so we cannot comment on that aspect. Again, for the price, it was terrible.

The hotel was packed for the holiday weekend and the pool area was insane on Saturday and Sunday, but the hotel had extra security and the kids didn't mind the crowds at all. Our rooms were clean and very comfortable and the hotel staff was very accomodating. I should mention our issues: we had no paper or pen to jot down a note, no bathrobes as in other rooms, and no \"do not disturb\" sign for our door. Parking is a big issue. A large parking lot on the far side of the hotel has been taken over by a tent. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, if you get back to the hotel after a certain period, there is no self parking available and you must use the valet.

Arrival: The lobby area is kind of blah with a newer feel. The reps behind the desk were nice as long as you were. I noticed a couple next to us having difficulty, being Irate and getting attitude back... normally I would expect more patience from the staff. But for me, I asked FOR A ROOM FACING SEA WORLD IN THE TOWER. This is a must. Reading the other reviews it seems like people hated the low rise buildings (Bay I & II). From our Balcony, (room 1603) you could easily see the fireworks at Sea World each night. I got the room and was pleased. Room was clean and well laid out. We fit two cribs in nicely into the room and never felt squeezed in. The halls were clean, the elevators although a little slow always worked well and we never heard them from our room. We never had the room cleaned, we were there for three days and just asked for new towels and shampoo which they gladly gave to us. Parking is a Rip and the spaces in the east lot are tiny. Go to the west lot (other side of the hotel) and the spaces are much larger. We normally ate at a restaurant on Sports Arena Blvd... There were many there... In & Out; Papa Johns, Chile's, Olive Garden, and all the fast food joints. On the other side of the bay just across the bridge is a great park with a bay beach. Good sand for sandcastles with minimal waves. If you like the waves, a few hundred feet down the same road (w. mission bay rd) and you hit the Pacific Ocean. Kids stuff... Our four year old loved all the water slides (you have to be at least 42\"). Our three year old loved the kiddie slide and out non walking toddler loved the slanted beach like pool where he could crawl down. For some reason the kiddie slide pool was colder than all the other pools, couldn't figure this one out. Each night you can roast marshmallows and make smores by the fire. They also had movies or other activities for kids through the day. Like I said, very kid friendly. The Water taxi is awesome. The tickets at the concierge are $3.00 per person but you can go and come back from SeaWorld as often as you like. Next time we go our plan is to go in the morning, come back for lunch and pool time, then go back in the evening for the night shows and fireworks. The breakfast if you have it included is ok. Definitely not one of those Vegas ones but enough to where you will have a decent breakfast if you can get it included.

Upon entering the room, we were struck with a very strong odor coming from the bathroom. My husband said it smelled like a men\u2019s room. A very dirty men\u2019s room. I tried a couple of different room sprays, and even bought some scented oils and candles. When nothing worked, I went to speak with someone at the front desk who promised to send housekeeping out right away. After waiting for some time, attempting to air out the room, we finally got tired of waiting and went to dinner, hoping that it would be cleaned when we returned. If anything, the smell was stronger when we got back. There is no way that someone responsible for cleaning that room wouldn\u2019t have noticed the stench. Finally the next day I complained again to the front desk and asked to be moved. When we were eventually moved, we did get a nice room in the tower. A few days after our return I sent a message to management and have yet to receive a response. Aside from the ridiculous $20 daily self-parking fee, the hotel really gouges you. There is a charge for poolside activities that other resorts offer for free. The hotel towels are tiny and limited \u2013 we had two of each, when there were three of us that checked in. The bath mat was miniscule and not thick enough to sop up the water that seeped out of the shower, and the couch in the room smelled of body odor. On the surface, it\u2019s a very attractive resort. The grounds are pretty, the restaurant has a beautiful view, and there are some fun cabanas outside of the pool area next to some fire pits. However, the seats in the cabanas are all stained and smelly, the restaurant food was marginal (the kids buffet was almost inedible), service was non-existent and for some reason the outdoor speakers continued to play music very late into the night making it hard to sleep. Dining choices? Forget about it. The poolside menu is not at all geared to kids, even thought the pool, with the 3 water slides, is meant to be a family environment. And if you are looking for a late lunch, you\u2019ll have to leave the grounds. The bagel shop stops serving lunch very early (it\u2019s also quite a distance from the hotel lobby area) and the restaurant does not offer lunch items past the usual lunch hour. On top of everything else, this location is constantly windy. It was so cold that we ended up leaving the pool after about an hour.

My sister had her wedding at this Hyatt two years ago, and we were all surprised to arrive in the middle of the renovations. We took the kids to the resort across the street to swim, the restaurant was gone, our room had JUST been readied and had no fridge. Some wedding guests in the tower had to go to other floors to showers. Skip ahead two years...I take my children out to visit with family. I had booked a room through the website, which I subsequently determined was NONREFUNDABLE, mistake on my part. I had reserved a 2 Queen room. When we checked in, we were assigned a room in the Bay II building. I have stayed at this hotel probably five times and didn't even know it was there. When we checked in, there was no balcony or patio. Again, I didn't even think they had rooms like that! When I went to the front desk to inquire, I was told that was a STANDARD Queen/Queen room. The rooms below me, with patios, were all King rooms (sure, makes perfect sense, give more space to the parties with fewer guests!). A dirty swim diaper was still in the trash can--my kids are 7 & 9, so it did NOT belong to me! I had forgotten the ridiculous charges for parking. \"Self-parking\" of $20/day was more than my subsequent stay at the Hyatt Orange County's VALET parking. The pool at the Hyatt Mission Bay was extremely crowded, and in the spa, I met some people who were locals and just mooching off the hotel for the afternoon. Then I was awakened at 4:45 by a drunk guest downstairs arguing with someone on her cell phone. After half an hour, I finally went out of the room, down the stairs and around to her patio to ask her to quiet down. (If I had had a balcony, I wouldn't have had to leave my room!) Almost immediately upon returning to my room the birds started making noise--this is a Polynesian style building with an open roof, and bird feathers litter the hallway, as they sit there in the morning and caw! We were busy with other activities, so ultimately I didn't spend a lot of time in my room. However, I had a bad taste in my mouth from check-in on, so I chose not to eat at the hotel & give them as few of my vacation dollars as possible. I did buy Sea World tickets from them, so we could take the water taxi/shuttle service, but the wording on the website made it seem as if it was a complimentary service if you bought the tickets from them; however, it was an additional $5 per adult (children free). I was charged for water I didn't drink upon reviewing my bill (we had bought the same bottles they provide at the hotel, so someone got confused by the fact there were FOUR bottles in the Fridge instead of two empty ones?) .

I just wasn't prepared for the full-on day-care kids camp that I encountered. If I did have children, I might choose this place, but have no idea how I'd afford it with kids. My partner and I arrived to find a diaper-smelling crib in our room. I called room service to have it removed, but gave up after 5+ minutes on hold. To be fair this was 4th of July weekend and the place was inundated. The bulk of the hotel services/programs seem to be directed at families. There are so many kid-directed activities I think this place should be called the \"Hyatt Mission to Cater to Kids Bay\". I have nothing against children, just would've liked a few more things that catered to adults - especially when paying these kind of room rates. But I guess technically a \"kids camp\" is something that caters to certain adults . . . parents. One other thing that I'll mention is that this hotel is not really near a \"beach\". Despite the \"beach icon\" that hotwire and some other vendors display. It is definitely on the ocean, but there is no swimming beach, It is smack in the middle of a marina. I thought we might be able to get away from the hotel pool and check out a real ocean beach, but that is not possible given the boat traffic and the fact that there is no sandy entry into the ocean. That said, there is a very good bargain to be had in the $5 round trip per person water taxi to sea world. This puts you right into the middle of the park and runs every hour and twice hourly on weekends. Red Marlin was a nice restaurant in a beautiful location - but you'll likely not have the wallet for eating there nightly. Room service was very expensive - $19 for French Toast. The bagel/coffee shop is a great option but note that it closes at 2pm. Just continue to walk another block or so away from the hotel and you'll encounter a couple of small hamburger/hot dog joints and a fresh seafood restaurant that are extremely reasonable and cater to folks in the Marina. Other than Sea World and the marina businesses (boat/jet-ski rentals and fishing charters) there is not very much nearby and the $20 day parking is steep. Overall this is a very beautiful property just consider the location carefully (getting to downtown or gaslight district is a haul) and make sure you can handle the heavy kid factor. I have nothing against kids - I just was expecting a bit more of a romantic setting, not sharing the hot tub at 10:30pm at night with a bunch of teenagers drinking beer and throwing foam in each others faces. I guess I also assumed the $239 nightly rate I paid (Hotwire) would keep most of the families priced out - but I assume they must've found some cheaper rate or just are not feeling this recession like the rest of us. The soundproofing in the rooms (I was in one of the \"Bay\" buildings) is also pretty much non-existent - noise carries quite a bit and Hyatt is playing loud music at the pool bar and some kind of club music all along the walkways, with speakers perhaps only 8 feet from the rooms.", "Date": "July 8, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cTerrible\u201d", "Author": "hotelsnoot", "ReviewID": "UR33849487", "Content": "Expected a lot more from on waterfront marina suite.

We returned to this hotel again for a second two-night stay at the conclusion of vacation to CA. Again, the hotel upgraded us on our last night at the hotel to a wonderful room with a GORGEOUS sunset view of the ocean! Just the perfect place to relax after a day at SeaWorld or spending the day at the beach. Overall, we were VERY impressed with our stay.

We've previously been extremely happy at the Cypress Gardens and Tamaya Hyatt resorts. The rooms at Mission Bay are nicely done, though the balcony furniture had a cigarette hole in them and looked dirty, chairs outdated, and glass dirty. The main issue for us at this resort are the pools and grounds/cabansas in the center of the tower and suites. There's a. no shelter from the wind on the pool level, and b. no shelter from the noise coming from that area. Complicating that issue, the hours on these areas are not curbed so there's a feeling that you're at a much cheaper hotel than a nice resort, possibly to keep families and kids happy, but losing the higher level resort appeal. There were also no kids' camps or care available, contrary to the family theme. The biking and kayaking available are only until 4 p.m. fyi, which is disappointing. There is no worthwhile beach nearby though the marina and it's quiet activity beautiful. The Red Marlin restaurant is excellent --service, and atmosphere; food is good/very good (depending); prices are high. Einstein's bagel shop is a nice addition.

The room was very clean and had a view to die for. During our stay we learned that all of the guestrooms just got new carpet earlier in the month. This explained why the room even smelled new. From the balcony we watched the sunset with a bottle of wine we bought at their provisional store. It seemed the Hyatt was the tallest building in all of Mission Bay. Looking strait down at the pools and waterslides reminded me just how high we were. We didn't have the oppotunity to swim in the pools as it was a little too chilly for my liking. However, the entire pool deck was great! 3 pools. 3 waterslides. a jacuzzi. Plenty of seating. A fun pool bar called SWIM with great plantain chips for something different to snack on. and a firepit where kids enjoyed roasting marshmallows once the sun went down. We ate at the restaurant Red Marlin for a late dinner. I had the seared Ahi and my husband had the pork chop. They were both just dynomite. The restaurant sat over the marina and was warm and cozy inside with a center chefs table and fire pit.

Our family member was staying there with an out of town group and we wanted to have a mini family reunion. The staff was very friendly. The room was another matter. We were given a room in an older part of the hotel. It has been advertised that there has been a recent renovation. This room was missed. On the plus side, the bed was comfortable. The bathroom, though dated, was clean and supplied well. The carpet in the room was very badly stained. We had a king room which included sectional sofa seating. It was comfortable but musty and stained. The A/C had a constant drone which was annoying when trying to sleep. Also, the vent was inadequate to control the whole room temperature. As long as you sat on the sofa you were comfortable, but the bed was further back in the room and the temperature in that area was not controlled. It was sort of like having a room A/C unit for a very specific area. The second night, the guests (elephants) upstairs were evidently restless. There was much pacing and drawer slamming and furniture moving until about 2:30 AM. The room had an IPOD docking station which included an alarm clock. It was not evident to me how to dim the LED so the room was well lit like a night light until I figured out to get a couple of washcloths to put over it. The room included a refrigerator which was supposed to be the wet bar. There was a sign indicating that it was stocked with supplies and that the water was $4.95. The refrigerator contained only one can of Pepsi. I do not typically use the overpriced items. In this case, my concern it that I would be charged for the missing items. I had a glass of tap water on the bedside stand and when the housekeeper cleaned the room, the glass was put on a coaster rather than replacing the glass with a clean one. I thought that to be odd. Maybe it was for water conservation. Added to our room rate was a $20 parking fee per night. If you wanted Valet, it was $25. We knew about this in advance and chose the $20 option. When we returned from our day of touring, all the self parking was full due to some event taking place in the massive tent that has been raised in the parking lot. (Overflow?) We used the valet service and including the tips, spent a total of $51 to park for two nights. But, as I said, that was not a hidden charge. I never found an ice machine. There was no indication of one on the hotel map. Our family member was staying in a different building and said that there was one down the hall from the room. I tried to call the front desk but was put on hold and decided it was not that important. The food options are rather limited unless you have a car (we did). Within walking distance is an Einsteins which is a Starbucks kind of business but not Starbucks quality. They offered bagels and breakfast sandwiches that did not look very appealing. We chose to go to the hotel restaurant for breakfast. The breakfast buffet was $21.95 per person. It seemed to be the best deal on the menu. The food was attractively presented and there was a wide variety. They did serve Starbucks coffee though. The view of the bay was very nice. The wait staff was very attentive. I tried to use the in room check out on the TV. The site was either down or under construction. I am not totally sure. Mixed messages and I was unable to start over even though I turned off the TV.

The room was not ready and since it took much longer than expected to get it ready we were given a complimentary upgrade to the 16th floor--a concierge club floor that included a continental breakfast (pretty good) and evening snacks (no great shakes, soft drinks and a some passable snacks- booze was not free as at other Hyatt hotel Regency club floors). It was really a nice gesture to give us this additional upgrade and indicative of the overall friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The room was small but the view was terrific.

There is very safe and free on-street parking in the Crown Point area so I did not pay the parking fee.The street parking in the immediate vicinity of the hotel prohibits on-street parking from 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. effectively eliminating that as an option. As a practical matter there really does not seem to be any policing of the hotel parking lot area so even if you did not pay the fee and get the paper tag for your dashboard, you probably can still park in the hotel lot anyway (because of a late return to the hotel on the last night we used the hotel parking lot and suffered no ill effects).

They stopped furnishing a coffee maker in room so they can charge $14 a pot of starbucks from room service!! They do furnish a small fridge, which was convenient for snacks for the kids. Also, they do inform you about the parking charge upon check in which is $20 per day for self park, which is pretty high. The pools were wonderful, room service food not too good.

The pool, while great for young kids did not have enough chairs and we found ourselves spending very little time there. Forget any adult relaxing by the pool.

The hotel managment was very nice overall. We talked to them about the queen vs. king bed issue and were able to get breakfast coupons for duration of our stay. Another small issue (room refrigerator didn't work) got us free valet parking. The hotel is nice if perhaps aging a bit. All of us loved the pool though and the only complaint there was people coming down at 7:00am (or earlier?) and taking up all of the lounges. Since we were doing other tourist stuff most days (Seaworld, Wild Animal Park...etc) and only hit the pool in the late afternoon or evening it wasn't a problem except on our final day. I've seen alot of other hotels stopping this kind of behavior and specifically telling people if they're not using the area their towels...etc, will be removed. Apparently not at the Hyatt yet though. With a decent sized group such as ours my brother and I agreed to suck up and split the cost of getting a cabana at the pool ($120/half day) and that was great and everyone had a good time. Breakfast at the restaurant was good. At $25 per person I doubt we'd have eaten there more than once though if we hadn't had the free vouchers.

Both had shower problems (bad heads), light bulbs out, terribly stained carpet, and just a general shabbiness. There were no curtains over the blinds, so the room never got really dark.

The staff was extremely friendly - always smiling and asking how we were doing while passing by. The pool was nice - not crowded at all and only a few kids. I think the people that commented earlier about all of the kids need to realize that they were going during the middle of summer vacation - of course there are going to be kids at the pool!!

After our horrible flight, we decided to go with a room in the tower with queen beds that was free at the moment. They said they would move us the following day but we decided the queen was perfectly fine and stayed there for the remainder of our trip. Although we didn't see the bungalow rooms, I would have to assume that the tower rooms are the ones to book. They have balconies that have nice seating if you have time to enoy that. We didn't eat at any of the restaraunts due to the reviews. but that wasn't an issue - there are a TON of places to eat around the hotel. This hotel is in a great location...just about ten minutes from downtown and the airport. Also, here is another tip if you are feeling risky - the hotel charges $18 for parking. We talked to one of the valet parking attendents and he said that although there is a sign on the street that says \"No Parking\" from about 2 a.m. - 4 a.m., he had never heard of anyone being ticketed. Well, we decided to try our luck. We stayed five nights and didn't have one problem. It seems a little ridiculour to pay for parking when it's not in the middle of downtown.

When I booked this hotel I thought that I couldn't go wrong with this Hyatt property. The pictures on their website and the fact that it was recently remodeled looked convincing as well but after reading some of the reviews on here my expectations were rather low. good thing: I was not disappointed. When we arrived I asked for a tower room as those were getting better reviews than the motel-style ones. The room we were given was on the 2nd floor, though and they had no other rooms. The front desk offered us an upgrade for $40 a day to a room somewhere on the 10th or 12th floor. This was not the Regency Club Level either but basically the same room category we had reserved. What a ripoff, especially considering that we already payed well over $300 a night. We declined the offer and accepted the 2nd floor room. The room itself was very nice and had a friendly atmosphere with tastefully chosen colours and contemporary style. The furniture was all new and the carpet wasn't stained. The Bathroom was unusually roomy and opposed to earlier reviews our shower had a small tray placement area. The Beds - simply awesome! Smaller details leave a lot to be desired, though, particularly at this price. The balcony was covered in dirt and so was the furniture outside - maybe something they forgot about after the remodel? The hallway seems to be mostly untouched during the renovations as the doors have lots of scratch marks on them and although you get a HD-Flatscreen TV the video quality is average at best. I know these are nit-picks but this ain't no Motel6. The downside to a room on the second floor was that we missed out on the awesome view over Mission Bay but not the annoying noise from the children and the music at the pool well past 11pm. The pool area seems pretty cool with nicely kept garden surroundings but very crowded. Nearly all of the chairs were already taken by 9-10am and they ran out of towels by about midday. We didn't care because we barely used the pool anyway. The red marlin restaurant offers a delicious breakfast buffet that you shouldn't miss out on. We ate there every morning. Dinner is equally good but pricey (main dish well over $30). Overall we enjoyed our stay except for those little shortcomings. The hotel is a convenient starting point to explore the San Diego area. Sadly we couldn't enjoy the amenities of the hotel as much as we would have liked while still seeing so much of the city... The Beach is only a few minute-drive away and so is Downtown and Coronado.

This is my experience at the Hyatt Mission Bay - First, although I had specifically requested a room with a balcony or patio, I was given a room with NO balcony or patio. When I was then moved to a new room, our balcony was part of a large balcony that spanned the length of the building, with no dividers between rooms. The people next door to us were outside late at night and used \"our\" balcony, as well as their own for a small party they were having. When I asked to be moved to a room with a private balcony there were none available. In addition to the patio problem, our room (which was barely more than a standard motel room) had stains on the carpet and upholstered furniture, nicks in the wood furniture, and none of the standard amenities I would expect from a Hyatt (coffeemaker, toiletries, etc). There was almost no place to put our clothes (two tiny drawers and a very small closet with an ironing board that took up most of the space). My daughter and I decided to go to the pool, which was noisy and crowded. There were no pool towels available which wasn't a big problem as there was also no seating available. Once we finally got seats and towels (roughly half an hour wait), we ordered a drink. Half an hour later we hadn't received it and decided to leave the pool. We did not use the pool again because every time we went by we found it crowded, noisy, messy, and with an insufficient amount of furniture. There were a number of other minor problems and inconveniences, but my point is this - if I had gone to a Holiday Inn or Best Western I would have expected these problems - and paid FAR less than the $287 a night that I was paying. When I go to a Hyatt and agree to pay the prices that they charge, I expect more than the standard motel experience. Being a holiday weekend, I was not able to move to another hotel which, I assure you, I would have done if I could have found one. My husband and I travel frequently and generally stay at Westins, Hyatts, or Intercontinentals. This particular weekend was intended to be a fun \"Mother-Daughter\" getaway, with time to relax and rejuvenate. Our experience at the Hyatt Mission Bay fell far short of our expectations.

Room is spacious and is nicely appointed throughout INCLUDiNG the Deck. It seems all of the rooms in the tower have lovely viewsl. Ours looked out over the pool and the bay. The staff is acommodating and friendly. The grounds are lovely Ok and now for the cons: The hotel lobby is cold an austere with obnoxiously loud music that greeted us when we arrived at 11 PM, kind of strange for a Hyatt, I thought. The parking price is outrageous given, the non-urban environment, however, there are spaces on one side of the street, that are not marked that were avail to us so we DID NOT USE valet, which saved I think $24 /night, not sure of exact cost. The pool scene is an absolute zoo.... think Disneyland on a holiday weekend. We were there on a summer weekend. The pool and waterslide was filled and I mean FILLED with kids and their parents. As if your fear of public water needs to be heightened, I went down to the pool are at 8:30 AM one morning ( I will explain why I was down there so early shortly)and what was the first sight I saw?? Was it that of blue water, glimmering in the early morning San Dieg Sun? Well perhaps but I was also greeted by a three year old little girl who had stripped off her entire bathing suit and was squatting in the shallow end of the shallowest pool peeing, while her mother attended to her older brother. And now back to why I was there at 8:30 AM, we soon learned that the some of the guests send their children, as I observed from my deck , down to the pool as early as 8 to \"reserve\" chaise which only has a domino effect of mandating that eveyone do so if they wish to not be seated on the cement by the pool during the course of their stay. I complained to the concierge regarding the hotels policy of allowing this. She was sympathetic, and stated that \" items left for 1 hour at the pool will be removed\" .We did not see evidence of this. As for the food, we ate by the pool and it was as expected for that type of dining. I did not attend the spa, but honestly given the way the place is over run with kids, I cant say that I would have relaxed any by going there. As a side note, my 12 year old son had a GREAT time.

I also confirmed that we were to have a rollaway bed. The person I spoke with told me that we were all set. We arrive at the hotel at 10:30 pm Friday night. Check it seems to go well, customer service is nice and the service is prompt. This is where things start downhill. We pre-pay $18.00/night for parking. We drive to the lot for our room and there is absolutely no parking left. So, we spend $18.00 to park in the street. I decided not to complain about this as the street parking was close to our room. Then, we try to find our room. Although I am accustomed to hotels putting even numbered rooms on one side of the hall, and odd on the other, this hotel puts even numbers on one side of the building and odd on the complete other side (through two gates that require your key). Also, there is no sign to tell you this until you walk around to the other side of the building. So, dragging suitcases and a cranky two year old, we eventually find our room. The patio area that greets us is filthy and has the prior tenant\u2019s room service tray and beer bottles on the table. Yuck. Then, upon entrance to the room, we realize that we are not in the Marina Suites (if I had been more awake, I would have realized this when there was no marina anywhere near the building). Instead, we are in a studio room with one king bed, and without a roll away for our (now really cranky) son. So, I called the front desk. They acted confused and then eventually told me that there had been a mistake and they did not have any Marina Suites left. After I complained some more, they told me they were willing to give me a $50.00 discount off the price of this room for the inconvenience. They also said that the next night we could move into the Marina Suite and if we left our luggage in our room, they would move it for us. Then, I addressed the issue of no rollaway bed for my son. I expressed the fact that he is two, it is late and he needs to go to bed very soon. They told me they would see about getting a bed. I also told them about the trash on the patio and they said they would pick it up. It took about an hour and four phone calls before we eventually got a bed. Also, they did not pick up the trash. The next morning we left to go have fun and came back mid-afternoon. I went to the lobby to collect the keys for our new room. The lobby was full of people checking in and there were about four attendants checking people in. I waited in a long line for about 20 minutes (it was obvious that the couple in front of me were having some issues that were taking a long time to solve). Finally, the attendant finished with the couple in front of me, and then she turned around and walked away without saying anything to me. I waited for about two minutes, as the other lines had grown even larger, and she did not return. The people behind me left for other lines. I went to the concierge and asked if there was anything she could do as I was a current guest, and she said no and that I had to wait in the long lines (again). At this point I was too mad to wait, went out to get my husband, and had him go back in and take care of it. We get to our new room (that looks absolutely nothing like the pictures online) and discovered that one of our suitcases had not made it to our new room. It took two phone calls before someone eventually located our bag and brought it to us. The living room of this suite was very small and very dark. Nothing like the picture online. Also, the bedroom did not have all of the windows that the pictures show. It had one sliding glass door and one very small window. Also, the balcony area was tiny; it was difficult to have even two adults on it. They did end up giving us the room for only $199.00 to make up for the issues. The room service was great, wonderful food, very prompt, very nice staff. Also, when they forgot to bring a rollaway bed to our second room, Courtney the manager brought it to us herself. Very nice. Not worth the price. We ended up spending way too much of our vacation dealing with hotel issues rather than relaxing. This put quite a damper on the vacation and put all of us in a rather bad mood.

All of the staff we encountered were friendly and helpful. Our room in the tower building was a typical hotel room, with a great balcony. We had a marina view, which was great, and everynight we were able to watch the 9:50 pm fireworks at Sea World from our balconey. We ate dinner at both resturants, The Red Marlin and Swim. The Red Marlin had great views, especially when the sun was setting, but was quite pricey. Swim was more moderately priced, but is situated off the pool and more of a bar atmosphere. The food was excellent though. Another great advantage to staying at the Hyatt was the water taxi to Sea World. For a $5 fee per person over the age of 9, the water taxi will deliver you to the back door of Seaworld and you get to go right in. The taxi departs from the Hyatt every 45 minutes past the hour, and departs from Seaworld to bring you back to the Hyatt every hour. The taxi drivers were great. I believe the water taxi only runs during the months of May to September. Our only complaints about this hotel were the stained carpets, and the noisy rooms. The walls must be very thin here because we heard noise to each side of us and above us every day at all hours of the day and night. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt.

The rooms were quiet; the only noise we heard a couple of evenings were the happy sounds of young children enjoying themselves in the pool.

Our two 18 year olds loved being within walking distance of Mission Beach and being able to enjoy the pool and workout room. The workout room is perched over the marina with a great view. The hotel is in a nice location but with the exception of Mission Beach, you will need to drive everywhere. The only problems we ran into was that the only adjoining rooms we could get had a king instead of the two queens we had reserved;' they were willing to move us to a lower level with two queen rooms but we decided to stay put and have the higher level rooms with the great view and get a rollaway.

We arrived on Sunday, hoping for a slightly early check in around 2pm and were happily accomodated, I also asked for an upgrade from the standard price line room and was given the choice of a standard King Marina or Ocean facing for $75.00 or a \"Corner Suite\" on the 11th Floor for $100 addtl per night. We chose the Corner Suite from the staff's suggestion. The Suite was unimpressive because the only differrence from a standard room was a larger office area for your laptop including a rounded desk and office chair. It also had this center island in the middle of it and a couple of extra windows. I called the front desk and told her that the office space was not needed and that we would just take the Standard King on a higher floor if available. She offered us the Regency Club Level room for $75.00 on the 17th floor. What a great change! The room was slightly nicer and only a spec smaller. Instead of the office it had a Big fluffy circular lounge/couch big enough for both of us to lay down and watch TV very comfortably. It had pretty Blue & White pillows and a blanket to cuddle and watch TV (Flat Screen) Huge shower with adjustable massage head LOTS of water pressue! It almost hurt on the fine setting like little needles. Really nice toiletries which I didn't expect. Only bad thing I can say about the room was NO bathtub! BOO! Balcony with Table & chairs set that over looked the beautiful Marina, and I'm glad we didn't opt for the \"Ocean\" side because that's also the pool side which is Busy Busy Busy with families until it closes. The Marina side faced multi million dollar Yachts and it's was fun to peak out in the middle of the night and watch the fishing boats prepare for the early morning charters. We also had the added benefit of facing Seaworld who has nightly fireworks at 9:50pm sharp! They are gorgeous from the 17th floor of this hotel on your balcony you have a front row view! We did not use the pool it was soo crowded with families like other posters have noted however what do you expect??? It's a family friendly place and if we had kids we would totally do this. Room service was good and fast, I mean really good! Another surprise. We ate at the Red Marlin one night because we were too tired to venture out again from the days travels, and were not disappointed. The steak was perfectly cooked and the olive oil mashed potatoes were great. The service was very good here. We were so pleased and ate while watching the yachts float gently in their slips at sunset. We paid the extra $5.00 for Valet for a total of $23.00 per night and it was worth it to us, since we wanted the ultimate relaxation on our vacation. No worries, we just called down and the car was sitting there right up front with a smiling gentleman waiting for us. We tipped when we returned each evening and were treated very graciously. I almost forgot! The Regency Club was soo worth the extra money we paid. Every morning there was fresh pastries, breads, bagels, fruit/cheeses, coffee(Starbuck's), 4 fresh juices, bottled waters, assorted cereal's, milk, and more I'm sure I'm forgetting! Gourmet jams & jellies, In the afternoon, cookies and soda's and juices. In the evening cocktail's, wine red/white, fruit & cheese, pasta salads ect. We snacked all day & night and everything was delicious. Free Internet & very nice computers already in the Club room ready to go. Lots of space for multiple people and two balconies facing the Ocean and San Diego Bay. I used their computers and printer to check us in and print boarding passes for our flight the day we checked out since they charge I think it's $10.00 per day to have Wi-Fi in your room. We just used theirs and saved the money. It was one step away from our room and no one was ever in there when I was. Lastly I must say the service at the front desk needs some improvement. I called on several occasions for various reasons, or question what not, and NO ONE EVER answered not once! The 1st time I thought, well they must be really busy, but by the second or third or fourth time, I was just irritated that I could not get the front desk to answer, not to be mistaken for the Hotel opperator (who was NOT friendly at all) she did answer and promptly patched me through. When we just gave up and walked down to the front desk I expected to see a crowd of people and every agent helping one, no. The employees were talking amougst themselves and immediately stood at attention \"Good Morning!\" when we approached. We needed Zoo tickets and they DO sell them (which is why I was calling) at a discount of $5.00 but plus a $2.00 service charge lol. So you save $6.00 for two. And the added bonus of adding them on to the room charge & we were gone in 2 minutes flat.

My husband and I, along with our 3 children, had a 4 day trip planned for quite some time and we were all really looking forward to it. We've stayed at Hyatts before, always with good experiences. When we go to Kauai we always stay at the Hyatt there and it's beautiful. And after hearing that this property in San Diego had undergone a major renovation, we were really excited. We were expecting a beautiful, clean room and everything we've always experienced in other Hyatts. We stayed in Room 2221 which is a suite facing the marina. The carpet was so filthy we literally would not walk on it in barefeet. And not just in one spot, I'm talking throughout the entire room. Large dark spots from the door through the entire room, a bright orange spot next to the bed. It was really awful. The sliding glass door on the balcony did not lock, no matter how hard we tried. Fortunately our children are old enough that this wasn't a hazard however it would definitely be for anyone with small kids. The shower drained so slowly that we called down to have it cleaned out. After our first night we called down to the desk to ask them to clean our carpets while we were gone and to address the shower drain and the non-locking sliding door. We returned to a room with carpet just as filthy as it was in the first place though they left a card telling us our request for service had been tended to. What? The pool area was nice to look at - clearly has been recently done and has an upscale feel to it. However, i agree with what other people say in that there is definitely not enough seating poolside to accommodate the guests at the hotel. We managed only to snag one chair to pile up our things on, but never could get a lounge chair. My husband and kids went in the jacuzzi and said it was not hot the way a jacuzzi is expected to be. It was just kind of warm. There was a sign in the room advertising the bottled water available for purchase but there was no bottle to be found. Our stay was supposed to be for 3 nights but after 2 I told my husband I wanted to leave. I'd rather have been at home than spend another night in this place. The only good thing is that it's located close to Sea World. What bothered me the most is that when my husband went to check out he told the manager in training all of what I have mentioned above. Of course the actual manager was \"on the phone\" and not available. A good business gesture would have been for her to offer to take some amount off of our bill or something else to show that the customer's opinion matters. I was not looking for her to comp our stay or anything. But she offered nothing and allowed him to check out having spent almost a thousand bucks on this dump. I went back in and took this up with this same girl since the manager was still \"on the phone\". I told her my concerns, how we have been patrons of other Hyatts many times, etc. She again had no intention of offering anything to us until I suggested that maybe they should take off the \"room tax\" they charged us for both nights and maybe take off the fee they charged us for using their Wifi service. She finally conceded and took off - woo hoo- a hundred bucks. How in good consicence were they charging 400 bucks a night for all this?

The nice modern design is perfect for a southern california vacation. It's a clean look with white bed linens, white bolster - comfortable w/ a front room sectional sofa & flat screen tv and then the back bedroom with a desk, flat screen tv, arm chair, and balcony with view of marina - boats literally right out your door. We could hear sea lions but it didn't disturb our sleep. This visit we were supposed to stay in the main hotel in a great room on a higher floor. However our preference is for a lower floor and were given the option to switch to the marina suites ( I think they only go up to 3 floors.) The front desk assured me the original room was better with a great view of the ocean but happy to meet our preferences. Another service plus, during our Aug. 07 trip, we lost the baby's boppy pillow that was a must have for the flight back. A bellman had found it and stored it for us. As well I had a problem with my rental car/parking etc. and realized it while sitting in the restaurant. The staff was incredible & called hotel security for me and helped me while I waited for my lunch. They went out of their way to help me! I ordered a simple burger& fries and it was so good. Great ice tea (I am a native Texan!), great service, and great view - you can see mission bay in the round restaurant with all windows. Like the hotel, the restaurant has a simple modern elegance that is very nice but comfortable as well. Very impressed! While my husband checked in, I steped out the back door to see the renovations completed that we're underway during our last visit. There is a courtyard of cabana like lounging areas etc - it's especially impressive at night with great landscape lighting. The pool looked smaller but nice and I didn't go into the area myself , just looked through the iron fence. The hotel is the perfect blend of elegance and comfort esp. since we've traveled with an infant each time.

I was looking for a relaxing weekend away and all I got was frustration. It is supposed to be a family hotel and I found nothing family about it. I checked in after 11pm and room service was already closed. I went down to the pool the next morning and all of the chairs were reserved by other people and there were hardly anyone in the pool. They do not have enough chairs for the amount of rooms that they have in the hotel. There is way too much wasted space in the pool area where they could have added more chairs. We asked for chairs and the \"lifeguard\" stand who was obviously employeed by the local college students were anything but friendly or helpful. They said that if we could find chairs, they would move them for us. There were people that had been there four days and they did not get chairs on any of the days. The only thing that was offered were the cabanas on the OUTSIDE of the pool area for $50. Why would anyone want to pay in a cabana outside of the pool, where you would need your hotel key to get back into the pool area. What were you all thinking when you designed that? After giving and going into La Jolla, we went into the restaurant and asked for an area away from people so our 17 month old child would not disturb anyone, we were sat right in the busiest section and everyone was getting annoyed. We had to get up and leave with our fine dining meal in a doggy bag. I order room service and ordered a children's meal and it was set up for an adult. The Chicken nuggets are not kid friendly size. I ordered string cheese and received a bowl of crumbled Blue Cheese. $4 for a can of Pepsi? Are you kidding me? I can buy a 12 pack for less then that. I think next time, I will go to McD's for real kids menu. They know how to cater to youngsters. The next morning I woke up early to get chairs at the pool and had the priviledge of seeing the LIfeguards sitting there playing with their cell phones and gossiping with each other. NICE!!!!!!!! Oh I can not forget to mention that the hotel was filled and at all times, they only had ONE person at the front desk. The concierge is adjacent to the desk and refused to help us. Of all the Hyatts that I have stayed in, and I have stayed in almost all of the ones in California, I will never go back to this one.

On the plus side, the location couldn't be better: within a mile of Sea World and right on Mission Bay in close proximity to the freeway, it has great access to the major tourist attractions (San Diego Zoo, Gaslamp District, Legoland) and the airport.

All rooms in this suite building have balconies with views over the water. On the negative side, the rooms lack DVD players on either TV and coffee makers (although there is an Einstein Brothers shop just outside the building ). For us, the big attraction of this resort is the combination of kid friendliness (fantastic water slides, variety of pools, and kid's activities (movies in the pool at night, bingo, face painter/balloon guy near pool), easy access (the resort is relatively small so the distance between pool and bathrooms, pool and guest rooms, rooms and parking are all minimal), and serious adult amenities (a great spa that mom was enthusiastic about after a facial and massage; responsive pool side service for drinks/food; and a terrific zen-like gym with fantastic views over the water.) The prime location near Pacific Beach means that there are many good restaurants nearby if you want to skip dining in the stylish but expensive hotel restaurant on the water.

They said they were 100% booked and could not switch my room until the next day (it was after midnight when we arrived). Then the next day they apologized that there was no other rooms available either. Hard to believe...could it be because I was a Hotwire guest who paid $124/night? The room was bare bones -- not even an alarm clock!! Had to pay for internet. Upon complaining they gave me a free breakfast coupon for their restaurant and when we went there the next day found it was only for two. Had to pay for the children which made our total with tax & tip come to $40!! That was for a very mediocre-buffet. The grounds are nice but the beach is not easily accessible. Hotwire calls this \"oceanfront\" which it most definitely is not. The pool are was extremely crowded and the waterslides have limited hours. I have stayed in a lot of Best Westerns that are much nicer. Hyatt should remove their name from this property. By the way, it is the same hotel as the Hyatt Islandia. Even though their website claims it just underwent a huge remodeling project, the money was apparently only put into the pool and ground and probably new bedding...the carpets and bathrooms have obviously not been updated in a LONG time.

We\u2019d already pricelined it and figured that our air quality in Los Angeles is bad enough, might as well go down to costal San Diego. WE called the Hotel to verify that the room was not needed for evacuees or emergency workers (we\u2019d have gladly donated it if needed), the hotel said they had plenty of rooms. Of course when we arrived, a major power outage in the Mission Bay area was ongoing (including Sea World). There was no way to pull up reservations, set keys, power elevators, etc. The office was trying there best. Pretty understandable given the major disaster covering the entire region. So we skipped freshening up and went into town for dinner. We called a couple hours later and they informed us that they had power. Unsolicited, they upgraded us to a fancy suite and gave us valet parking for the price of regular parking for our inconvenience. The suite was fantastic \u2013 balcony over the marina, large bathroom, separate living area with convertible sofa and large flat screen TV \u2013 we hooked up our travel DVD player and took advantage. Bed was extremely comfortable \u2013 robes in room. Made for a nice relaxing evening and morning. The property was clean and well maintained. The exercise room was under refurbishing so they shuttled us (complimentary) to a fancy health club a few minutes away (no charge for its use). Mission Beach is a nice community and very scenic and relaxing. Pacific Beach across the river is nice at well, but a bit more sketchy. Close proximity to La Jolla for excellent sunsets. The only downside is the parking fee. There\u2019s PLENTY of street parking, but the city has made parking illegal for a few hours in the early, early morning, forcing one to pay 10-14 bucks for parking despite the availability of ample street parking. It\u2019s one thing to do that in an urban area, but here it just seems to be for making $. I\u2019ve stayed at the Dana Hotel across the street which does not charge (not as fancy as our suite at the Hyatt). Oh well, still a nice location.

In the past, RESORTS have been RESORTS/Condos....this was a glorified hotel room with the Hyatt name. First off, these were studio units, which was not what I booked or told I was getting for another couple and I. Also this was missing many of the regular amenities, all the resorts I have stayed at over the past 10 years always had....There was no dresser to put our clothing and had to live out of a suitcase. There was no kitchen and no laundry facilities in the room or in the area! Those were basic shock factors! Second off, the room was disgusting! Stains all over the carpet and in walking around the room over a 30 minute time frame, left our socks dirty! Wore sandals the rest of the time in the room! The room also had black marks all over the wall as the pictures show. These were on all walls, some small and some big! Our windows also had no screens in them, which is a major child safety hazard. Lastly the internet connection did not exist and upon looking beneath the desk, noticed there was a mess of wires and fire hazard waiting to happen. Plus for a $200 + a night RESORT, they charge $10 a day for internet connection! Anyhow, a shocker and embarrasment as I was the one who took another coupe and their family here with talks about how amazing the places I stay at in the past were! For the price and reputation Hyatt has, you would think they took better care of their RESORT and would be in nicer condition. Guess they limited their profit cost back into all the construction and renovations they just finished with! The area and views are nice, but for the price and quality, I would have been better of staying at an upscale hotel for half the price! I will never stay at this resort again when in San Diego!

Each day I spent there, I liked the place more and more! Check-in was flawless - there were parking attendants and bellhops at the ready immediately upon our arrival. Inside the lobby, there were 3 desk attendants who were assisting with check-ins and other guest requests. Initially I was disappointed to find that our room was located in \"The Suites\" building, which is a small, 3-story, motel-like building located to the side of the main hotel. My concerns were put aside the second I stepped into the room. The door opened to a spacious living room area, that was tastefully decorated and included a large, flat-screened t.v. and a sectional couch with a pull-out bed. Separating the living area and the sleeping area was a hallway containing a mini-refrigerator, a dresser, a closet with double sliding mirrored doors and a large, very clean bathroom. I am pretty certain that some of the reviews I read indicated that the bathrooms had showers only, no bathtubs. That was not the case with the room I had. It had a bathtub/shower combination. The sleeping area had 2 queen sized beds, with plenty of pillows and crisp linens. The beds were firm and comfortable. There was a t.v. on the desk, along with internet hook-up (which was a paid service - $10/24 hr., I think). The nightstand had an I-Home that doubled as a radio-alarm clock. There was also a chair and ottoman in the bedroom. There were sliding glass doors which led to a small deck overlooking the marina. The glass doors allowed for plenty of light to enter the room, but were easily darkened with curtains when necessary. Overall, the room was clean, secure and quiet. The loudest and most common noise was the sound of luggage wheels on the walkways. That noise was apparent from the living room, but I don't recall having heard it from the bedroom at all. There were occasional noises from the marina, but nothing to complain about. The pool area was fantastic! The outdoor temps were in the low 60s during my stay, but the pools were heated to a nice temperature and when I got chilly, I sat in the hot tub to warm up. The water slides are an excellent addition to the pool! The slides are attended by a hotel employee / lifeguard at all times - the slides were closed occasionally for breaks and closed for the night at dusk. The 2 big water slides open into a medium-sized pool that had a walk-out ramp at the end opposite the slides - this was the coldest of the 3 pools, but the water slides were such a distraction that I barely noticed how much cooler the water was in this pool compared to the other 2. There was a smaller water slide which opened into the smallest of the 3 pools - this pool was warmer than the other slide pool. The largest pool did not have water slides and it was a bit deeper and a bit warmer than the other 2 pools. The hot tub was roomy and a nice break from the cool outside air. I found the pool towels to be plentiful (and warm!) and restocked every day. There also appeared to be waitress service on the pool deck. I didn't use this service, but it appeared as if orders placed at Swim Lounge were delivered poolside if requested. I did not eat at Swim Lounge, so I can not comment on the service there. I did, however, eat at Red Marlin - 3 times! The service and food at Red Marlin were excellent! It was pricey, as expected at a nice hotel restaurant, but the presentation and flavor of the food made it worth the cost. I would place Red Marlin in a fine dining category. Having said that, it was very accommodating toward my young daughter. There was a children's menu and my daughter was treated like a princess by everyone at the restaurant. All of the food I had there was excellent and, overall, it was a very nice place to dine. The hotel staff appeared to try very hard to make for a pleasant stay. Every time I was in the lobby, the desk was staffed by 3 or 4 attendants, including a concierge. The concierge was very helpful in making local recommendations, making reservations, and providing driving directions. I utilized this service numerous times during my stay. The cleaning staff was also very pleasant and meticulous. Because self-parking was so convenient to where my room was located, I did not use the valet service. The only \"issue\" I had during my entire stay was trying to find the exercise facility. It was listed in the hotel directory as being on the 2nd floor of the tower. It was actually located right off of the marina, behind \"The Suites.\" It was not fun running from building to building in the driving rain - at 5:30 in the morning - trying to locate this facility. The facility itself is typical of a hotel exercise room - a few treadmills, a stationary bike, some weight machines - but with a beautiful view of the marina and harbor. In closing, this hotel is conveniently and beautifully located. It was very easy to drive anywhere I needed to go.

I'm not sure what the tower rooms are like and this review only reflects my experience with a room in the wings. The room has been somewhat recently renovated. It's too bad, though, that the carpet was a bit stained in my room (1916). It is also unfortunate that when they updated these rooms (and I think they did a pretty bang-up job on the overall renovation) that they didn't remove the popcorn texture from the ceilings. It makes it look dated. Overall positives: Great furnishings as part of the renovation, including LCD TV; comfy bed; lots of light from slider; interesting room design. Issues: Noise was a big issue for me here and I'm generally not a light sleeper. I heard TVs on both sides of my room very clearly. I also had a \"heavy walker\" above me and I was pretty amazed at how clearly I could hear that walking back and forth. Mission Bay is close to the flight path for SAN, too, so there was some aircraft noise. An additional noise source was the heating system. This, clearly, was not updated in the renovations. It looked ancient and made a big ker-bang every time it shut off. It jolted me awake a couple times. The location is great only if you have transportation of your own.

To add to our disappointment, as we arrived with luggage in tow, the valet standing right outside the front entrance looked us in the eye as we struggled to move 3 pieces of luggage up the flight of front steps as we entered the building, and didn't move to even open the lobby door--as he stood 2 feet away from us. ?? The staff all seemed to be consistently the same in this unfriendly, unhelpful way, with the exception of 1 young door man who was nice enough to recomment a good Mexican restaurant. The trek (again, without offer of help or assistance with anything--including luggage--from anyone there) to our room was confusing with no offer for help or direction, water dripped onto our heads off the (unfinished?) 'patio' ceiling, and appeared to be a construction scene, until we realized that that's actually just the condition of the hotel. It's not modern, not warm, not convenient, not very clean. It was 2 floors and had that very old motel-ish look and quality. We are not sure of the condition of the tower portion of the hotel, as we were in this older 2-story section. Our 'bay' view offered us the lovely sight of a maintenance building, a crane, a bobcat lifter, and garbage cans.....oh, and a little slice of the bay beyond all that lovely scenery! Sorely disappointed. The carpet in our room was dirty and stained. The hotel's condition, staff, and ammenities were a deep disappointment to us, and we're not extremely picky travelers. We would not under any circumstances recommend this hotel, especially when you consider we found a room at the nearby Best Western for a much lower price and (unexpectedly) cleaner, nicer and rooms in much better condition.

But if you don\u2019t know it\u2019s happening, how can you avoid it? The Regency branding is supposed to indicate a luxury resort and setting, but staying at this Hyatt in November 2007, with their renovation running five months late, only the setting part was even mildly luxurious. This hotel comprises both a main high-rise tower and some low-rise marina-side accommodation. At the time we stayed there the main lobby wasn\u2019t built, and the only place for breakfast, apart from expensive room service, was the Swim Cafe, a pool-side snack bar intended to serve pool-users. The choice was absolutely minimal and self-service. The pools themselves were not in use, as their renovation hadn\u2019t quite completed either. Our marina view king room was fine in itself - spacious, light and airy, if a little minimalist on the decor. The view was good with a sunny balcony. Our bathroom lacked a tub, and the shower ran water that was tepid at its warmest. The hotel\u2019s public facilities were just non-existent. There were no lounges or other public spaces available. The hotel was largely occupied by business convention groups, who dominated the place. One group were selling a gothic teen clothing brand, and their delegates ate from a mobile kitchen around the back of the hotel, and were a frequent site coming and going, wearing hoodies, drinking beer in the elevators, and generally acting like extras in a bad teen movie. I\u2019m sure this hotel will be better when it\u2019s renovated, but from the layout and situation I doubt it will ever be great. The location on the marina is nice, and if proximity to Flipper is your overriding factor, then you will be close to Sea World. But the limitations of the architecture will never make for a wonderful hotel, renovated or not. How Hyatt have the nerve to sell rooms in a hotel with so few of the facilities working is beyond me, and sell those rooms at full price too. I felt it was worth only half what we paid given the state of the place, and were thankful we had only a two-night stay pre-paid.

The bed was new and comfortable, the furniture was good but not great, and there was a flat screen t.v. The room was clean. However despite the $65 million in upgrades, my bathtub did not drain properly after I showered. If two people are sharing the room and each wants to shower this could be a problem. The fit and finish of the bathroom was poor, although I want to stress it was clean. What was puzzling was that in order to use the internet you had to pay a fee -- either for a cable connection or to log in to wireless. Something that is provided free at Starbucks should be likewise free at a hotel that considers itself first class. Paying more than $10 per day to connect is just annoying. Room service ended at 10 p.m., a problem for some of our group that got in late at night. Our meeting room was not signed -- I mean how difficult could it be to put up a sign saying \"Palm Room\" on the door of the Palm Room? When I checked out using the express machine, my receipt indicate that the food I had ordered was liquor. Obviously, my professional group was not going to reimburse me for drinking my dinner. I had that changed by the front desk, but it took a while. Others have mentioned that this hotel is out of the way. It is if you want easy access to downtown. If you have a car you can drive to downtown, the gaslamp area, etc. fairly easily. If not, a cab ride is going to run you $25 or more.

Location The location of the hotel was ok. I expected more of Mission Bay to be accessible on foot but we soon realised that if we wanted to go anywhere from the hotel it was by car. Walking around the harbour from the hotel was nice but there is only so far to walk. The hotel is about 10mins drive from downtown and about 15mins to La Jolla. The Mission Bay beaches are a couple of mins. Check - In Check in was ok - I think the girl was new - although we didn't receive any info about the hotel and the room had no info on what restaurants/bars where on site, info about the spa or general facilities of the hotel. I think the Hyatt could improve in this area as they are really undermarketing themselves Rooms We had room 1011 which had amazing views over the harbour. The rooms itself was huge - the biggest by far that we have ever stayed in. It was newly refurbished and you could tell. The bed (wow) was super comfy and the sofa and furnishings were all top notch. The bathroom as well was amazing. As far as hotel rooms go this is the best one I have ever stayed in. The only note I would make is corporate feel to the place. As soon as you enter the room you are faced with \"this costs $10 and this costs $x\" making it loose the personal feel. Spa We had a lovely 'couples spa' as an extra treat. The Spa has also been renovated as the facilities were fantastic. The rain fall shower was the most amazing shower I have ever day. Day beds in the relaxation room would have been great but other than that I can't complain. What I can complain about however was the 18% gratuity that I was charged with on my checkout bill. I apparently signed for this but I honest don't remember. It made an extravagent treat feel really expensive. Pool I was also disappointed with the fact that the pool complex which the website before booking said would be fixed in Sept 07 was no-where near finished. This was one of the deciding factors of booking this hotel so I was really fed up to find some of the outdoor space a building site. Luckily our room did not look out on to this and reception took $100 off the bill but it still should not have been incorrect on their website. Tourist stuff We ate at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse which was fantastic. We didn't realise it was quite as upmarkets and pricey as it was (we needed to dress up a bit more) but the rib eye steak was just amazing. We also ate at The Spot in La Jolla which I would def recommend for a good American restaurant/bar and Red Lobster which was great food but a little more 'big chain' than I was expecting. Seaport village is worth a visit as it San Diego Zoo (pandas!) and the Gaslamp Quarter. The Horton Plaza was ok for shopping too. My favourite place without doubt was La Jolla and if we ever visit again I would stay here. It's just what I imagined San Diego to be like.... palm trees, boutiques, restaurants, beach, parks. You MUST visit this place to see the nicest part of San Diego. Overall I would definitely book this hotel just for the rooms alone.

If, however, you are visiting San Diego as a tourist then you need to consider the following. The hotel is within walking distance of Sea World (15 minutes) and Belmont Park Amusements and Pacific Beach (25 minutes). It is, however, a fair way out of San Diego city. If you are intending to hire a car, then its location is not too much of an issue. If you are not, however, you will need to catch a bus (No.9) and then the trolloy bus (blue line) to get to San Diego city, which can take 40 minutes. Around the hotel there is also a paucity of restaurants and hardly any shops. Popping out to the local drugstore is a non-starter as there is not one anywhere near.

It's torn up, spread out, inconvenient, and many amenities are either lacking or a pain to use. Think of it more as an apartment near some restaurants and you get the idea. A few examples: If you want to swim, you can be taken 3/4 of a mile by van to a private athletic club. It's neither convenient nor capable of being anything other than an excursion--although they will take and pick you up on demand. No easy independence for anyone in your group. You have to plan to take everything you will need with you. Forget something and ..... The hotel has decided to allocate about 95% of the surface parking for their extra-price valet parking. There are VERY few spots left for anyone who doesn't want to pay that fee, yet 80% of the valet spots are VACANT. There is additional \"self-park\" across a road. Guest-friendly? You decide. If you stay in the tower you are going to walk a fairly short distance with wooden siding hiding the construction areas on one side because you have to walk around the back to get to the elevators to your room. There has been no noticeable construction noise but we are on the other side of the hotel. It's hard to convey the feeling one gets during the walk, but in summary it's not a good feeling. There isn't a trash can in sight. Period. Not inside, not outside. Not in the hotel hallways, not anywere. If you want to dispose of any litter, well....good luck. They installed new built-in furniture in the room and there is a built-in set of electric plugs on the vertical wall that is part of the desk unit. Unfortunately when they spec'd the placement of the electric/computer plugs, they set the box too low on the wall and many cell phone chargers and other chargers cannot be plugged in because the charger power unit can only be plugged in one direction and there's no room for the charger plug to fit in and be electrified. There is nothing in the room tower but rooms. No lobby, no real service (there is a small gift shop, however). If you want to go to the lobby or desk, you go out the back of the tower, walk around the multi-story tower, walk across the parking lot and in another building. It's more like staying in a really tall motel that's spread out without any cohesiveness. To get to the hotel none (not ONE) of the guiding signs off I-5 /I-8 say anything but \"Hyatt Islandia\"and that is not where you think you are staying. The current name isn't anywhere, even when you are right next to the hotel. It's confusing and ridiculous. We stopped at the hotel for directions from what we thought was a sister property, only to find out that the signage was all wrong and we were at the hotel. That's inexcusable and an example of inattention to guest needs, poor planning and poor management. There are some good/neutral points: The employees have obviously been trained, trained, trained to be \"cheerful\" during the renovations. The rooms have some size to them (at least in the tower) and the bathrooms are reasonably sized. The televisions are decent or better.

There is no pool at the hotel (unspeakable in San Diego!) and guests have to go to a nearby hotel if they want a swim. My room was in the Tower, and was one of the newly renovated rooms.

I was there for a conference, and the Islandia was one of the hotels used to house convention registrants. This was one of the most disappointing and inconvenient hotel stays I've had in a long, long time. Let me say at the outset that the staff of the Islandia were unfailingly courteous and friendly. No doubt the conditions at the Islandia have been extremely difficult for them. No, this is a prime example of very, very poor management, reflective of a genuine contempt for their guests. The Islandia is basically a construction site with rooms, not a functioning hotel. Let me detail some of the inconveniences: 1. The construction noise -- and it is quite loud -- starts very early in the morning. My room was so noisy that I couldn't even hold a phone conversation. I had to ask to use a courtesy room during the afternoon to do some work. (There are no common areas or rooms because of the construction. No open areas, no nothin'!) 2. I did not bring a laptop, figuring I could access e-mail through the hotel business center or TV Internet. Wrong!!! Of course, whatever business center previously existed is now part of the construction site. The TV Internet did not work in my room or in the courtesy room I used one afternoon. 3. The one small available restaurant on site was so packed in the morning that I had to order room service and spend extra money to do so. Of course, I could've made a L-O-N-G walk to the hotel across the highway, given that I didn't rent a car, but I decided to splurge on room service instead. 4. Guests received a note under their doors informing us that on Tuesday, May 22, there would be NO WATER for most of the day because of \"emergency\" repairs. 5. The next day we received another letter under our doors, instructing us that locks were being changed and we MUST report to the front desk to get new key cards. 6. The hotel site is dirty and cramped. After checking into a makeshift check-in desk, you walk outside with your bags, following a dirty \"red carpet\" (Hah--how ironic!) that takes you through part of the construction site, scaffolding and all, to an elevator bank that takes you right to your room. 7. There appears to be absolutely no acknowledgement on the part the hotel management that this is such an inconvenient and unpleasant place to stay. The letters they give to guests, explaining once inconvenience or another, are written in a sort of insulting, insincere \"happy speak,\" as if they were informing us that some minor amenity, such as mints left on your pillow, could not be provided. This is a hotel that obviously is into making a buck in the midst of a gut rehab. Stay away unless you want to be deeply disappointed and pay high rates for less than Motel 6 amenities.

The wife and I decided to have a \"weekend-getaway\" to San Diego and chose the Hyatt mostly due to it's location to Sea World and a place called MIssion Beach where we were to meet up with a few friends. We had a most delightful time and the Hyatt played a major part. So here are the pluses for us followed by some notes that others might feel could have an impact on their staying here: 1) We checked in at 3PM not realizing the check-in time is 4PM but were still given a room right away by a very polite desk clerk. 2) Our room was just what we asked for(Ocean view with a balcony) and it fit our needs. The size was perfect for us and the bed was sooooo comfortable. We slept very well not only due to the bed but we were perhaps lucky that we had quiet neighbors as we only heard the sounds coming from the Bay area. All in all, we appreciated what we were given. 3) The pool and jacuzzi were very nice. Towels were readily available as was cocktail service. Though we were there on a weekend, we had no trouble finding a lounge chair or room in the jacuzzi. 4) We had breakfast included in our plan. I can't say it was the best ever but having stayed at other Hyatts, it was just what we expected. For the uninitiated, the buffet and service is acceptable, no less, no more. My wife though was pleasantly surprised that the smoked salmon she had the morning she opted out of the buffet was better than expected. 5)The hotel sells Sea World tickets for about $6 less than when you buy at the park itself. But verify with the concierge about specials at Sea World. She pointed out to us that they were having a AAA special and the tickets were even cheaper so I am glad this was pointed out. 6) Overall, this place was just fine and the weekend price we paid of about $235 per night(incl. breakfast) seemed to be in line with what that gets you anywhere on a summer weekend in San Diego. Now some notes that I guess might make this place less-than-perfect for some of you a. No shuttle to Sea World. We were surprised we had to drive considering the location is the reason so many choose to stay here. b. Our room had a shower stall only. For two adults, it was fine but with small children it might be good to verify beforehand. c. Parking lot fills up, especially if there is a special event in one of the halls. Be ready to do some searching for spots unless you like valet. The charge is $14 per night, a little more for valet Also note the spaces are spaced more for compact cars. Be careful entering and backing out of spots, not much room between rows. d. One couple remarked their balcony on the marina side was closed due to some remodeling going on. It did not impact us. e. I see some reviews talking about the hotel being dated. A person we know from there thinks the place may have been around since the late 60's or very early 70's so it seeming dated would not be surprising. Fortunately, everything in our room was clean and in working order so the age of the building had no impact on us. I am sure there are plusher and newer hotels but we were very satisfied and had a relaxing 3-day-2-night stay. .", "Date": "August 28, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sacramento, California", "Title": "\u201cOver-rated on Hotwire...\u201d", "Author": "anonymousmac", "ReviewID": "UR5603344", "Content": "I purchased this hotel at a rate of 150 a night on hotwire.

At check in, once again, I requested a tower room, they told me that since all their standard rooms had been sold out, they would upgrade me to no charge to a tower room. (The feeling I got here, was that they were unwilling to upgrade me at all costs. They only upgraded me because there were no more rooms, not because I had asked for it in advance. Our first room was on the 11th floor facing the bay (poolside) We got in and the room was a little humid, and felt stuffy. This room was obviously dated, with fixtures that look they were from the 1980s. The room was large, featuring a small sink and generous counter space, (it looked like a place in the room where you would place food when hosting guests) the view of the bay and pool was great but we preferred a room facing the marina (facing seaworld) They upgraded us once again to a room on the 15th floor. This room looked more updated albeit a little smaller. We did not mind at all, what mattered was that this room looked newer. there were fireworks around 10 at night, although short, it was an okay show. Also from our room facing the marina, we could get a view of downtown San Diego and the planes taking off from the airport. There were maintenance problems to the room next to us, apparantly their shower was not draining. Hotel maintenance knocked on our door and asked if they could test out shower, luckily it was now clogged. I was not surprised with this maintanance problem after reading the previous reviews. As others had said also, the walls are very thin. This hotel is DATED, you can tell when you walk through the halls of the guest rooms. If you are looking for a nice hip place to stay, this is not it. Hotwire gave this hotel 3.5 stars, i would say that this hotel is deserving of 3 stars. Nothing from this hotel amazed me, or made it memorable. Service was great, the people are friendly, the grounds are nicely appointed. What ruined the stay was the room. I would ONLY stay here again if it was free, and if i decided to go to sea world. Im not going to say not to stay here, but I will say that it probably shouldn't be your first pick, unless you are going to sea world. Its isn't that bad, but its not the best place for a memorable stay. The only good thing about the room was the view.

The rooms were okay - not brand new but nice. We stayed in the main hotel - not the high rise rooms. Everything was fine except mid-june the humidity was brutal. It was way to cold for swimming - anything below 80 degrees is too cold for us (we live in Arizona).

Room service is a little pricey but if you balance not having to leave and drive around the area to find somewhere it's pretty nice. Sea World was GREAT!

We ate at the ShipWreck Cafe for lunch and dinner. Great food - huge portions. For those with little ones - bring juice boxes - beverages are at least $2.65 and little ones tend not to drink a full size drink. My husband and I both had Cheeseburgers and they were great. Hand made patties - not frozen - with all the fixins. Huge portion of fries. Carrot cake was delicious. Best theme park food I have ever had. They also had salmon, a variety of salads, jumbayla, and chicken. We left the park around noon - came back at around 4pm to see some shows and wait for the fireworks. The Shamu show was great. But as in past reviews do not attempt to sit ANYWHERE in the soak zone. You will get SOAKED. Cold salt water. Not fun. We avoided that area. It's more appropriate for older kids that won't mind getting dumped on. The dolpin show was great. All shows run about 20 minutes so they aren't too long and can keep little one's attention. Lots of hands on exhibits for the kids. Stingrays, dolphins, and starfish. Finally the fireworks... they were a nice end to the day. The only hard part is sticking around to see them.

We stayed in a Jr. suite in the tower(14th floor). The view was great and the room was large with a balcony overlooking the marina and windows on the side looking south, down the coast.

The nice thing about the sliding glass door was that we could open it, and kind of air out the room. It smelled a little old, not bad, just old. The room had vertical blinds in the room and someone had pulled off some of the decorative paper on a few of them. Disapointing visualy, but still an ok room. The bathroom had typical tub/shower combo, sink, and nice smelling hand soap, shampoo, lotion, and shower cap. Also had a vanity outside the bathroom, as well as a coffee maker with a per cup fee. They also offered bottled water in your room for a fee. The grounds were lovely. There is a Koi pond with a cute bridge going over it, and the pool and jacuzzi were great. We took advantage of the 7am opening time and really liked the view of the harbor from the jacuzzi thru the glass walls. You can also walk past the pool to a sandy (hotel made) sun area with lounge chairs by the harbor, or just take in the view of the boats. The hotel offered breakfast in your room that you could order by leaving a hanging card on your door knob, or varying levels of to go breakfast and lunches for the traveler or business person.

We had a car and it seemed that nothing was more than a five to fifteen minute drive.

Both were so good the first time, we quit looking for anything else and ate most every meal at one of the two. But back to the actual hotel. The rooms were nothing special, but clean and comfortable. Good water pressure in the shower, comfortable beds and a balcony with an awesome view of the marina and the bay...you could even see the downtown skyline. We were on the 7th floor of the tower. From what I could see, the tower was the place to be. The marina rooms looked like a Motel 6. The pool was supposedly heated but I didn't get in because it was chilly everyday we were there. Although I saw a few brave souls swimming everyday. The complex was nice. Almost like a resort. There were bunny rabbits all over the place! Service was good. Everyone was very helpful. The fitness room was adequate for what I needed...again nothing special. You have to pay $11 a day for parking so don't be surprised about that. I travel a lot and it's not really all that uncommon. The best thing was the location. It was right on the water...not on the beach, but it was too cold to spend too much time on the beach anyway. For some awesome views drive up Mission Bay Blvd till it turns into La Jolla Blvd and get out anywhere. Breathtaking views of the ocean and the multi-million dollar homes there. Also worth seeing is of course the zoo, although not as impressive as I expected, and the Torrey Pines Reserve was great for hiking. Talk about awesome views.

To be honest, beyond walking the marina boardwalk and trapsing about the lobby and giftshop, there wasn't much for him to do.

When we checked in, we were informed that we had been given an 'upgrade' from the junior suite that we had booked to a marina suite. Initially, we were pleased at this turn of events until we realised that we were walking in the opposite direction from the tower (which apparently, is more modern and well maintained) when being shown to our suite. Our hearts sank. The first thing I noticed about the suite was how dark it was. Anytime we were in it, we had to have all of the lights on all of the time, even though there were numerous windows around the suite. In the bathroom, we could barely see anything at all! It was clear that the suite and indeed the hotel in general, badly needs updating. The decor is dated, the bathroom in particular needs ripping out and replacing and the door to enter the suite was so old, that if you leant against it from the outside, you could nearly force your way in which didn't make it feel very safe. We were also very disappointed to find that the suite had no safe. I would have thought in almost any room of this supposed grading (absolutely not 4*) let alone a suite, a safe would have been a basic amenity. We found it very inconvenient to have to continually make trips to the front desk to use a safety deposit box. The high point of the suite though, was the beautiful view of the marina. We were a bit concerned it might be noisy being so close to it, but it didn't bother us once. The grounds of the hotel were pleasant and well maintained, particularly the area containing the koi pond, which many people have pointed out. In terms of food, we had a very mixed experience at the hotel. We were given vouchers to use for breakfast which could be used either at Blue Bay Bistro or for room service, so we did both. We had one good room service breakfast (corned beef hash) which was nice but ordered pancakes on another day which were literally the most vile thing we have ever tasted. They were burnt and tasted like they'd been made with salt instead of sugar because they had the most awful sour and bitter taste. No matter how much we drowned them in syrup, they were clearly inedible and I couldn't physically swallow a scrap of them. Similarly, we had one good breakfast in Blue Bay Bistro when we ordered from the menu and another that was awful when we chose the buffet. The food had all clearly been sat there for a while. It was soggy and luke warm and for some reason, one of the servers forced a bowl of biscuits and gravy onto me (we don't have that in the UK so I didn't really fancy it for breakfast) which I found bizarre and bewildering. I don't know whether the buffet is always of that quality or whether they took their eye off the ball because it was a Sunday when they have a champagne brunch at Islandia restaurant, but it did no-one any favours. The Islandia restaurant itself (which I understand is only open certain days which I found a bit strange) we enjoyed very much. We were seated at a lovely window table overlooking the marina and found our server to be very polite, kind and helpful. The food was plentiful and of good quality. We found the location of the hotel to be OK, obviously paricularly for SeaWorld but we ended up spending a lot to get taxis to various other places and in hindsight, it may have been better for our particular needs to have stayed in the downtown area instead. Also, the hotel is next to a busy road and I did find that the noise bothered me from time to time. We made use of the concierge's services by booking some attraction tickets and a day excursion with her and we found her to be helpful and pleasant. We were collected at the right times, had no problems with the tickets and found everything ran smoothly. The staff in general, we found to be a mixed bag themselves. Some were very helpful and polite particularly the servers, concierge and bellhops but others, especially on the front desk, seemed to have an attitude. Upon checking out, we were given a bill for 4 nights spent in the suite. We pointed out that it was already paid for and had handed over a voucher saying as much, when we checked in. This turned into an argument for a few minutes as the girl was adament that we hadn't. It actually became quite embarrassing and we started to worry that we were going to have to pay again. She then flounced off, saying she would get a manager and returned a few minutes later, agreeing that we had paid but blamed our travel company (who we have used numerous time and are always impeccable). We didn't receive an apology. All in all, a disappointing stay at a disappointing hotel and if we were to return to San Diego one day, we would not even consider staying at Islandia again unless it had a major overhaul in terms of accomodation and some of their staff.", "Date": "December 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada : Qu\ufffd\ufffdbec : Qu\ufffd\ufffdbec City", "Title": "\u201cHorrible hotel, 3 stars not 4\u201d", "Author": "Skyscraper", "ReviewID": "UR4100424", "Content": "I've stayed at the Hyatt Islandia first week of november before a visit to Sea World the next day.

It was very quiet, and not bad, but not the 4-star property they claim to be either. Rooms B The room itself was okay, a pretty standard 3 star room, with a very tiny bathroom. The bathroom did have marble countertops, but that does not a 4-star make. I do have to say that they did a great job with the lighting\u2014so often hotel rooms do not have enough lamps and/or overheads, but our room here was very well lit. There was a very small balcony with a couple of metal chairs and a tiny plastic table. We did enjoy the fact that we could see the fireworks (put on by neighboring Seaworld, I believe) from the balcony. We did not enjoy the fact that our room (we were either on the 3rd or 4th floor) was directly over the area where they have the dumpsters, making being on the deck hard on the olfactory glands! ). I normally would have asked to switch rooms, but we were exhausted by the time we got there, and it just did not seem worth the effort for one night. If you are planning to stay here, I would recommend asking for a room on a high floor, with a view of the marina (we had a bit of one, but it was heavily obstructed by HVAC systems or similar equipment Service A The valets were very friendly, check in was quick and courteous, and the bellhops were also nice as can be. We had dinner at the Blue Bay California Bistro at the base of the main tower, and our waiter was quite friendly and brought our food out very quickly. There were only about 2 other parties in the restaurant at the time, so not sure if it would always be that quick, but hopefully so! Restaurants B+ I was disappointed to see that the Islandia bar and restaurant was closed during our stay. We asked and were told that it is only open for dinner Wed-Sat, and for Sunday brunch (we were there on a Sunday night). It is the more upscale of the two restaurants at the hotel, and looks out directly onto the marina. The dinner we had at the California Bistro was actually delicious, though, so we were pleased with that \uf04a They have a pretty basic menu of sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc, but very fresh ingredients are used, making the sandwiches we had quite tasty. Bars C If the Islandia Bar had been open during our stay, this category would probably have gotten a much higher score. It looked spacious and pleasant, with (I believe) a seating area out on the deck where you can relax and enjoy the sunset or the lights of the marina. But, again, this was closed, so the only other bar option was a very small, dark, depressing one at the base of the tower. We walked in and pretty much walked right back out\u2014it just had sort of a grim atmosphere. Pool/Grounds B- The grounds are kept clean, there\u2019s a small koi pond, which was nice, and the landscaping is well maintained. But nothing particularly spectacular here. The pool itself was not at all impressive\u2014small and very basic, surrounded by a fence which tends to take away from the overall look of the grounds. I\u2019m sure they have to have the fence up for liability purposes, though, since many families stay here. There is also a tiny (maybe 20 feet by 15 feet) manmade \u201cbeach\u201d right off the marina. Be forewarned: this is not an actual beach, but more of a dirty sandbox. If you want to lay in some sand, I would recommend the Hotel Del Coronado or even the La Valencia in La Jolla (just up the hill from a bit of beach) instead. Location Depends If you are planning on spending a lot of time at Seaworld, the location probably cannot be beat! The location is also pretty much equidistant to La Jolla and Coronado, among other areas, so if you want someplace where you are 30-40minutes from nearly everything, this may be a good choice for you. If you are just planning on spending most of your time in downtown/Old Town/Coronado (for example), though, this hotel is probably not the best option. There are also no restaurants within walking distance, which can be a problem when they only have one restaurant open. If you want something different, your options are to order room service (pretty much the same menu as the Cali Bistro) or to get in the car and drive a little ways away (not always appealing when you are exhausted from traveling!) Overall, this is a decent hotel, just not quite up to the standards of a 4-star property, in my opinion. If you can get it for around $100 a night, and don\u2019t want anything fancy (or want to be very close to SeaWorld but not anywhere else), it is worth considering.", "Date": "July 25, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cOkay at a certain price\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3691734", "Content": "As has been well documented here, the Hyatt is an older hotel.

I would give this hotel 3.5 stars on a 5 star scale. Upon check in immediately requested a Tower Room based on reviews on this site. I was granted one on the 3rd floor tower and was told it would cost extra to stay any higher. Whether that was BS or not I will never know. Overall, I thought the staff was pretty good, helpful and courteous. The room I stayed in was satisfactory to us. It had a double queens with a balcony. Room size I thought was better than a normal hotel in its class. The small balcony was a nice touch. I didn't have the problems with cleaniness that others have posted. We have breakfast one morning at the restaurant in the tower. I thought the food was excellent, but pretty pricey for a breakfast. Overall, worth it. The more expensive restaurant located on the hotel grounds, I didn't experience. The hostess was pretty rude when we entered near the end of Sunday brunch. I see others had similar concerns. Pool and Jacuzzi area I thought were excellent and pretty quiet during my stay. This was definitely an older crowd at this hotel, not many families that I saw. Internet terminal in the lobby is $4.95 minimum, pretty pricey for one person for checking email, but not bad for two people. I think $4.95 got you 12 minutes or so. There is only one terminal, so for non business travelers w/o their laptop, this could be an issue during peak periods. Location was pretty decent, close to bus stop into the city and close to the freeway. It was in a quiet marina area, no problems with noise during our stay.

We stayed at Hyatt Islandia in MIssion Bay. A nice location right on the bay, a marina on one side, close to Belmont Park & the beach & \"boardwalk\" area. The hotel room wasn't ready when we arrived at 3:15 so we went for a ride & some lunch/supper (it was 6:15 \"our time\" so we were hungry). Returned to the hotel a littel before 5 and were told the room still wasn't ready so they offered us an upgrade to a Marina Suite. While we were debating the relative merits of taking a suite, the original room became available, but the offer was still out there, so we took it! Had a bedroom w/2 queen beds, TV, a patio w/2 chairs overlooking the marina, a little wet bar area, and a living room w/TV, table, chairs & sofa/pull out bed. Decor a bit shabby, the sofa was uncomfortable to sit on to watch TV, but we were hardly in the room so it wasn't a big deal. What a kick to sit on the patio and see pelicans and a seal or two poking around the boats in the marina! They nickel & dime you to death there, however. $10 a night to self park (altho' we did have under the bldg. parking, which was great when it was raining) and $20 night for internet connection! Business travelers have come to expect WiFi at the better hotels (think Omni), not that price for a dialup connection! The bathroom lighting should have been better - kind of hard to put on even the little bit of makeup I use with the lighting provided! Even the connecting area where the wet bar and another counter with 3 mirrors were poorly lit. They have a \"thing\" they do there to save water - they say they'll only change your towels and linens every three days to conserve water (save our planet) unless you call and tell them no thanks. I certainly did call and say we wanted fresh towels daily, thank you very much. We've been on a couple of cruises where they do something similar (there's a REAL need to save water in their case), but they do it in a better way...they say if you want the towels refreshed, leave the used ones on the floor, otherwise hang them back on the rack to dry if you plan to reuse. I think that's more user-friendly than making a customer call to say they want clean towels. All in all, I would recommend this hotel. It's a nice location, close to the beaches and the highway both, and the facilities seemed very nice. We did not use the pool, but they have a small sandy area with chaise lounges they call a \"beach\" for those that want some sun with no water. it's not really a beach, but you get the same effect for sunbathing. Breakfast at the Blue Bay in the hotel was good - we had the breakfast buffet which was standard hotel buffet stuff - scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, fruit, bacon, sausage, french toast, biscuits, gravy, syrup (I think I'm leaving something out, but can't remember what). We did not have any other meals than breakfast there (I ordered an omelet off the menu one morning, it was very good). We tried to go to the Islandia Grille on the Thursday night around 9:30pm...hours on the door said open 'til 10:30 but all the doors were locked. We just wanted maybe an appetizer and a drink at the bar. A bartender came out and said they were closed. Hmmm...was that a management decision or just the bartender's choice??? We did enjoy a drink in the Towers Lounge a couple of evenings...comfortable chairs and loveseats to sit in and chat, and a decent sized bar if you wanted to sit there.

It was great. The second we walked into the lobby to check in we were treated like queen's. The entire staff was friendly and took time out to answer any questions we had. The hotel is in San Deigo but the grounds were so nice you felt like you were in Hawaii. It was very tropical. The pool was heated and clean. The spa was huge and very clean as well. Our room was awesome. This is the first hotel that I have slept in where the bed was great. The bed was soft, and so were the pillows. The room was very clean. We had a great view of all the docked boats, and we were surrounded by water. At night we left our sliding door open and we can here all of the seals playing right outside. We got a newspaper on our door step every morning. The room service was fast and good. We ate breakfast at one of the hotel resturants and it was not very good, but the service was great. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone. It is also a great place for families with children. This hotel made a weekend vacation one of the best vacations I have ever taken.", "Date": "March 2, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palo Alto, CA", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than expected!\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoBearsFan650", "ReviewID": "UR3211455", "Content": "Room: space and d\u00e9cor The room is quite large and the d\u00e9cor is fairly current. The bathroom fixtures seemed to be quite recently installed, and included a granite vanity, white tile and a shower. I personally like having such a large shower, but if you are a bath person, or have kids who like to take baths, it might be an issue. I suspect that being a beach-oriented hotel, they probably found the shower to be more practical. The furniture looked to be new, and was quite contemporary looking \u2013 generally the same I\u2019ve seen in other Hyatts. The balcony was showing its age with some dirt and water stains, but was certainly fine to sit and enjoy the view. Room: Cleanliness I found the room to be acceptably clean. There were some \u201cmarks\u201d on the toilet. They might have actually been from a crayon, since they were blue. There was quite a bit of dust and some pieces of trash underneath the bed. Other than that, the room was clean. The maid service was good \u2013 they picked up all the bits of food and trash that my toddler left behind. Room: Amenities (TV, Coffee, desk, view, couch, chair, etc). All of the standard amenities were present: a comfortable sitting chair, a desk and chair, comfortable king sized bed, TV, remote and coffee maker. Our tower room also had a balcony with great view of the hotel pool and grounds, mission bay, mission beach and Pacific Ocean. We had wonderful views of the sunsets. Hotel: Amenities (Restaurant, room service, workout facilities, pool, transportation) I ate at the \u201cBlue Bay California Bistro\u201d for dinner during my stay. Then menu featured a wide variety of American and Mexican-influenced food. The waiter was quiet, but attentive. The d\u00e9cor was pleasing and relaxing. I especially liked the cobalt-blue lampshades on the accent lights over each table. The Tower\u2019s Lounge is a fun place to get a drink. The waitress was quite conversational and friendly. The bartender wasn\u2019t overly generous on pour of my Bushmill\u2019s \u2013 it was a little on the short side, but I still enjoyed the few minutes I spent there. I made use of the hot tub on one night. The water was warm, but a little cooler than I would prefer. Its large enough that it doesn\u2019t feel crowded, and I had some nice conversation with some of the other guests. Hotel: D\u00e9cor Generally, the d\u00e9cor of the indoor public spaces was pleasant, but a little dated. Hallways seemed to need a little refreshment. The lobby furniture seemed a bit worn. Much of the interior and exterior of the complex looked a little 70\u2019s due to the extensive use of pre-fabricated concrete forms. Coupled with the islands-themed landscaping, it reminded me of the Polynesian and Contemporary Resorts at Walt Disney World in Orlando. Since that brings back pleasant memories of my childhood, I can\u2019t really complain! The grounds and landscaping were quite well kept up. Hotel: Location The Islandia is in an excellent, central location for a trip to San Diego. Many people have pointed out its proximity to Sea World, which is certainly true. Its proximity to I-8 and I-5 make it a breeze to get anywhere else in San Diego, especially Old Town, Mission Valley and Downtown. Mission Beach is only minutes a way going west. Hotel: Staff \u2013 courtesy, attitude and promptness Check in was handled swiftly. Every employee made an effort to smile and say hello during my stay. We had been billed for a water we didn\u2019t drink, and the checkout clerk credited us for the charge and actually complimented me for checking the bill carefully. Value/overall impressions: I have to say that after reading many of the reviews I was really skeptical about the hotel. After staying there, I really find myself wondering if either some people were unduly critical, or if the hotel has made some recent changes or upgrades. I felt that the $75.00 Priceline rate was a fantastic value, and I would be even prepared to pay up to $150.00 given the location and amenities of the hotel.", "Date": "February 19, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Michigan", "Title": "\u201cConfirms My Decision to Stay Away from Hyatts\u201d", "Author": "MrBillMi", "ReviewID": "UR3183450", "Content": "I recently received an email from Hyatt Regency. As a Gold Passport Mermber I had not stayed at a Hyatt property for some time because of past disappointments. The email was urging me to try Hyatt hotels again. I decided to give them a try. What a mistake! I made a reservation at this hotel, The Islandia in San Diego. Pre-paid for a weekend and paid to upgrade to a room with a Marina view and king bed. I arrived at the hotel at 7:30 PM. I was told that they did not have any king beds left. So I accepted a room with 2 queen beds. The 12th floor hallways were in desperate need of rework as the wallpaper was coming loose or was torn in many places. When I got into my room I discovered that the \"upgraded marina view\" I had paid for was a view of the parking lot and parking structure. If I craned my head a certain way I could see the marina. Several of the outlets in the room were cracked and I was afraid to try plugging anything into them. The wallpaper and furniture were overdue for updating. The desk was rickety with age. I had to pull it away from the wall to discover the outlets that were attached to the desk itself. It rained all weekend so cabs were in short supply and the hotel did not offer a shuttle to the immediate area, So I ate in the restaurant 3 times. The servers would drop the food and never check back to see if I was satisfied. Never once did anyone thank me for my patronage, and the crowning mistake in my book -- they missed my wake up call which almost caused me to miss my return flight home.
