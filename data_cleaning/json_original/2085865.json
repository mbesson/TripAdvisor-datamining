We were booking our accomodation last minute and weren't sure what to expect. The hotel is charming. The photos on the website do not do it justice. We stayed in the Rose Garden suites (2 parts to the hotel- garden and the roe garden). The rooms are beautifully decorated and they had provided a fruit basket and wine in the room on arrival. Great parts about the room: Great bed with amazingly soft sillky sheets (slept really well), power shower with a really big shower head, flat screen TV, balcony overlooking the courtyard. The hotel has complimentary afternoon tea everyday which is a lovely added bonus- and if its sunny you can take this in the patio-ed garden. They also have a computer and free wi-fi. Decent breakfasts including an omelette station, and plenty of free bottled water. Location is great too. Greatest asset though without a doubt is the staff. They answered all emails promptly before we arrived, arranged a taxi for us from the airport, helped us plan our itinerary and were always on hand if we needed any sort of assistance. I actually left some possessions beind at a public baths on the last day of the trip and emailed the hotel to ask if there was any chance they could help me to reclaim these. I never thought I would get them back from the baths but the management went out of their way to speak to and visit the baths to make sure I did. You will never get service like this at a large hotel....and to be honest even this is rare! Ayhan in particular is an absolute star within their hotel team- loads to thank him for!

We asked for a double with extra bed for ourselves and our son, and they gave us a good sized room that was not only well appointed but also served us well all week.

The Rose Garden Suites property was renovated in the past year or two, and the entire property (30+ rooms including the Garden House) is all new since 2006. We were on the 3rd floor (no elevator, not a possibility in this building) and had a very noisy family our first night (think kids screaming at the top of their lungs while running in the hallways ), but they quieted down as soon as we brought it up to Sel\u00c3\u00a7uk. I was on a cane the entire trip , but did not have any difficulty with the stairs or with the location and the walking around the city from here. On New Year's eve the hotel put on a reception with live music, talented and professional musicians who were also friends of the staff, for the guests, and also had a low cost option to have dinner at the hotel, which was very nice in a city where every restaurant charges an arm and a leg for New Years reservations. Two suggestions for the hotel and for people who stay there. The hallways are all marble and so they reflect the sound quite a bit. Carpeting the stairways would make it much quieter without detracting from the look of the marblework on the floors.

The service is very friendly and they go out of their way to be helpful, providing maps, guidance etc. The are many hotels in the vicinity so if you are arriving with a taxi from the airport it is advisable to have the address and a map handy. Visiting Beyoglu is a must but a bit if a mission from here, the nearby tram is probably the best way. The included breakfast is Turkish so as long as you are not expecting a fry up or continental you will be satisfied (think fruit, olives etc) and of course some good Turkish coffee. We also ate in the restaurant and enjoyed it but at the same price point Istanbul has better to offer. The hotel is not wheelchair friendly so if that is a requirement stay somewhere else..

In addition, the complimentary toiletries are lovely. The breakfast is also exceptionally good, offering a wide variety of foods so that you can choose a traditional English kind of breakfast or a typically Turkish one - with lots of fresh fruit, nuts, yogurt etc. The breakfast terrace, despite not having an expansive view of the sea or city, is pleasant.
