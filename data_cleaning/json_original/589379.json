{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Rude Employees! Door doesn't bolt! Services advertised NOT available! Rooms small, refrigerator makes a funny noise all night long. Location right on the freeway and very noisy. Nonsmoking room smells like cigarrete smoke. Deadbolt doesn't work and when I expressed concern about my safety they came 24 hours later to install a chain, but the deadbolt still doesn't work. I also spent a night in a room without a deadbolt lock, as did who knows how many people before me, because they couldn't get someone out to fix the door on the weekend when I arrived.The hotel advertises wireless and wired Internet access, but neither are consistently available. The web site states that wired access is available throughout the building but is only actually available in some rooms, if they happened to run the cable there apparently. The wireless is sporadic at best and everywhere seems to have a very low or limited connectivity. When I called to the front office to let them know something had gone wrong with the connection I was rudely told it was my computer's connection that caused the problem. I asked for any idea on unique settings that would need to be enabled or ideas, but was told I don't know, just change your settings. My computer then connected to another network at a nearby restaurant with no problems. I was again treated rudely when I asked the clerk to reset the router because there seemed to be a signal problem. I asked about the wired connection and was told that if it was available it would be under the kitchen table, but only a few rooms have that. I rebooted my computer twice and then the clerk asked me to call back in ten minutes because he didn't want to deal with my computer problem anymore. He asked me over and over if I wanted him to be able to do his work or not. It was a rude, strange question and he was not customer oriented at all.I am moving to another hotel and will never return here OR to any other Studio 6.", "Date": "Feb 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR406319928", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "christinadq"}, {"Content": "Neither good nor bad The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the room was FAR smaller than it appeared in the pictures. The bed was NOT a queen, nor would one have fit in that room, the shower rod was broken and the curtain slipped to the middle of the rod making a HUGE mess everytime you took a shower, and the door lock was BROKEN!! The door and frame had warped so much that you could not deadbolt the door at night. The front staff was very apologetic and offered to fix it immediately, however the person that wrote down the room number we were in (after asking twice), got it wrong and when we got back to the room it STILL wasn't fixed. They did fix it the next day but then we had to call and request room service. The towels are awful. They look like something they use in hospitals or prison - small and very rough. The elevator on our side (we were in 326) looked old and after riding it once I refused and used the stairs. The creaking, smells, and lurching did not inspire confidence. Every time I used the hair dryer it smelled like it was going to catch on fire. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was surprisingly spacious, the staff was pleasant and spoke excellent English, all of the appliances worked, and since I got the room for $50 a night including a full kitchen - I considered it a bargain to have so few problems (even tho the two I had were whoppers!).My suggestion - Inspect your room the moment you walk in and take your own towels and hair dryer.", "Date": "Aug 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR223139456", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "ivannabc"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d589379-r13371099-Studio_6_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "589379", "Price": "$68"}}
