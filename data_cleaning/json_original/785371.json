{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A Stunning Garden Taman Agung is located on the East side of the island away from the busy streets of Kuta.The actual hotel is on a busy street in Sanur however the hotel is located further down its drive way so it is very peaceful. The hotel name itself I think means beautiful garden and its gardens were really stunning. The moment you enter the drive way its beauty takes over. It has a hindu temple and little statues here and there that you come across everywhere. I found some of our best memories walking to and from our room. The exterior of the buildings are very lovely and I would recommend to hire the bottom rooms because of its lovely exotic patio (extremely pretty at night). This hotel is often chosen by the Indonesian people to stay (proves they know the best places).Pool - The pool however is very small and doesn't have a swim up bar (as you see in the pictures) or at least does not have it anymore. However it is very clean and has a pretty dolphan fountain. There is a sitting area where you can sit and even order from the restaurant to eat there. There is a few deck chairs around the pool for lazing around.Room - We hired a Deluxe room so to have airconditioning which wasn't that much extra. We stayed for 10 night and all it cost us was $500 AUD. We were on the top floor so we had a balcony which was very nice and peaceful. The only downer about the room was that the bathroom looks like a hospital although very clean.Staff  Service - The staff were all very friendly and always dresses in traditional balinese dress. Their English was quite good too. They always have smiles on their faces which I found hard to get out of most of the Balinese people. Check in was very quick, easy and they even showed us to our room. The hotel maids always gave us a nice smile as well. The only problem was that one of the maids mistaken my small face towel as their own and took it. I asked for it back but as it was white and of the same size as theirs it was kind of like looking for a needle in a hay stack. It didn't bother me too much because it was only a cheap one. The next day after our check into the hotel staff offered us a list of activities for us to do. You can also hire a scooter from the hotel which was really fun.Restaurant - We only ever ate at the restaurant for breakfast which was nice. The restaurant is directly above the reception and is sort of like a balcony, which has a nice view of the hotel. It is decorated in full Balinese style which is so lovely.Location - The location of this hotel is perfect if you are looking at being far away from the busyness like at Kuta. The hotel claims to be a beach inn however it takes about 15 minutes to reach it (casual walk) and when you get there it isn't very swimmable. There is still some little shops around including the little side stalls and the people that are selling stuff are just as bad as the ones in Kuta 'You buy you buy!'. Always remember to haggle or you will get ripped off! There is a mall not too far away that sells lots of cheap food but everything else there is exactly the same stuff as the street stales but even more expensive. There are a few bars here and there although not as booming as Kuta's they are quite easy going and there are countless beautiful restaurants where the food is alright and cocktails very yummy.If you are looking for a holiday in Bali with a beautiful beach I recommend you hire a hotel which has a private beach otherwise you will get bombarded with people trying to sell you stuff and give you messages. Also the water is filled with rubbish e.g noodle packets and wrappers.", "Date": "Nov 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR877556244", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "joey_grrl6"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297700-d785371-r10974932-Taman_Agung_Hotel-Sanur_Bali.html", "HotelID": "785371", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
