The 6 bedroom room with on suite was more like a normal/large room with 6 beds in it, clean tidy no mould as some have stated as in other rooms, these rooms cost us around \u00c2\u00a325 per night per person you can't really complain I have stayed at hotel that cost more and were far worse. Beds are super soft sit and sink in them ok to sleep in no complaints. there is a hairdryer in the 6 & 5 bedroom rooms and also safes in each however we did not use these. also shower toilet and sink in each of the 5 & 6 bedrooms rooms. the 5 person bedroom again slightly smaller with 5 beds packed in not as newly decorated as the 6 room but still clean tidy no mould or real problems small fist size hole in wall on left as you walk in the door but apart from this nothing to be really worried about. Both rooms were located on the 1st floor As we only stayed in the rooms for 5 and 6 people I can not comment on the 2 bedroom rooms or others. Very quite clean and no complaints about hotel in general. You get for what you pay for and it's a 2 to a 2 1/2 hotel if you want a romantic beautiful hotel then you will have to pay for it, if you want a room to crash in and then go enjoy Amsterdam then this is fine. Checkin painless as to effort fill out a quick form. Guy was a bit of a miserable sod but no big deal as it was late so may have been a off day for him. However like others have said the 'credit card machine' does not work which means you have to pay euros for the rooms as soon as you check in which was really annoying as there was nine of us, all who only bought enough euros for the drinking and eating side of the trip and the room was expected to be paid via credit card so as to be paid off back in the UK, this resulted in us all having to find a cash machine (which is located on the corner need a cafe) and withdraw more euros for the trip resulting in cash machine charges for all. didn't do breakfast as loads of cafes and things on the sort 10/15 minute walk to the main town centre/red light district (or 7 minute walk to a supermarket next to a chinese which has loads of food). it's a 20 minute walk max to station which isn't bad at all. Don't think by my review that this hotel has lots of stag do people or large groups as on our stay we did not see anything that gave us this impression. Would I stay there again? Yes when we go back with the boys to return to Amsterdam on a boys holiday, would I stay there with my girlfriend? If the rooms are like the 5 & 6 bedroom rooms as in of decoration and on a tight budget yes, however if romancing then I would look elsewhere, however this is my opinion only.

There is no lift, not a biggie, not uncommon in Europe. So it is in fact a very steep and narrow staircase to climb with luggage, but if you know it ahead of time, is it really that big of a deal? The rooms on the SECOND floor are clean, esentially...slightly smelled dusty/musty, the ceiling had water damage and was the sort of ceiling you find in very old schools, like has some asbestos in there. :) Anyway, it's tiny...very tiny. You will get in each other's way, but if you're on vacation, I can hardly imagine that you would be spending any significant amount of time in your room anyway, and if you are...find a resort, don't go to Europe. Let's say that maidservice here is less than just okay. It's very inadequate. Well, we requested a room with two beds, we were given a room with one double bed that could not be separated. They proceed to move us downstairs to another room on the ground level. RUN NOW if they offer you this room. As this is the actual room I'm here to review. It is dark, DIRTY, VERY dirty, the attached pictures should provide adequate explanation. It's like being in a dungeon and everything is scuffed, dingy, peeling, cracking, molding, dusty, etc. Can I just tell you I felt like I was a prisoner trying to hide in this room? The window, looked out well, it didn't...it's blocked by a tangled mess of brambles, and what you could see is that other peoples home entrances on the other side of the street led up from this back area, and also used the area to store trash or something. The front desk is nice enough, but beware of using the blow dryer...you have one hour to use it from the time of pick up or they will charge you a penalty for the dryer. No, not joking. Also, they DO NOT accept credit here AT ALL. Just a warning. We had prepaid so no biggie. The breakfast is your standard continental, not all that fresh, not really worth writing about, so we'll move on. A tram stop is, however, close enough in proximity. Leidseplein is technically within walking distance, it really isn't that far. So...as I said, I'll let my photos speak for themsevles.", "Date": "March 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, UK", "Title": "\u201cWon't be going back\u201d", "Author": "BritBronco", "ReviewID": "UR20043443", "Content": "We stayed at the hotel in July 2008 while on a (quiet) stag do, as we were attracted by the low price for the 6 person room. Hotels in Amsterdam are not cheap, but this appeared to be quite reasonable. First of all finding the hotel was easy enough, although we do know Amsterdam quite well. Although the hotel is slightly away from the main tourist areas it is well connected by trams for both Dam and Liedesplein and it is a reasonable walk back from Dam after the trams stop. Unfortunately price and location are about the only things this hotel has going for it. The 6 person room was occupied about 90% by the beds, there was very little room to move apart from this (perhaps it would benefit from bunkbeds) and the bathroom was tiny. There was no air con in the room, so having 6 people in the room soon made it extremely hot. The Stag refused to have the window open at night which made it too hot to sleep, and once we finally got him to open the window we were woken up at 6am due to the construction work across the street!! Breakfast wasn't a great experience, but it was no different from any other breakfast I have had in an Amsterdam hotel.

When we checked in at the hotel, the wall behind the receptionist was filled with printed banners. These were the sort of poster you might imagine hanging in a woman's kitchen; \"behind every great man is a better woman\", \"to err is human, to really mess things up takes a man\" etc. You might take these as light hearted jokes, and normally so would I, but the entire wall was taken up with these banners, floor to ceiling. Every single one of them made a derogatory or insulting statement about men. Not wanting to cause a scene, I didn't mention it to the woman who was at the desk when we arrived. I wanted to take a photo so I could show people how bizarre it was, but could not do so discretely or I would add it here. The room (number 11) was unbelievably tiny. It reminded my girlfriend and I more of a prison cell than a hotel. The wallpaper was pealing, and the view out the window was of a disused, littered courtyard. Because the room was stuffy when we arrived, the first thing I did was open one of the double-door-windows. As soon as it was unlocked, the entire door fell off its hinges, and I spent fifteen minutes getting it back on. Next, I checked out the en suite, which was also in a poor state of repair. It was so small you could not disrobe (for a shower or to use the toilet) without the door open. These problems alone would have placed this hotel as the worst I had ever stayed in, there were more issues. When we returned to the hotel after our first day in the city, we found out that the light switch in the room did not work, and had to rely on a sidelamp to illuminate the entire room. We also found getting to sleep very difficult because of noise coming from other buildings through the courtyard outside. At some stage that night, we scuffed one of the sheets on the bed. I'm not sure how it happened, but it looked like a black streak caused by one of our boots. Our bedsheets were not changed over the course of our stay, as that scuff mark was present every afternoon we returned to the hotel room. At the start of our second day, I discovered I had been bitten several times by an insect. I put this down to bad luck and applied some ointment. The following morning, I began to suspect that the bed might have bugs as I had several new bites. I said this to my girlfriend, but she did not think bedbugs were the answer, and as we had only one night remaining, we did not request to be moved. Later, however, she was coming out of the shower and saw a mouse, which we subsequently heard scuttling about during the night. The next morning, I had several new bites, and my girlfriend too had been bitten several times. Fearing food-poisoning, we had skipped the breakfasts every morning which were included in our booking, and on the final morning, we checked out earlier than we have from any other hotel. I have never written a review of a hotel before, but this place was so unbelievably bad that I felt I had to submit something. Do not stay here, even if it is the only place available in your price range. Reschedule your flights, get a holiday loan to afford a better hotel.

Just around the corner was a bakery which smelt delightful every morning. I regret not buying anything in there because it smelt wonderful and i'm sure it would have tasted just as good, judging by the huge queue outside! The hotel was down a small alley way (Our taxi driver didn't even know the hotel existed! - after several calls to people, he finally found it!) and the hotel certainly wasn't a looker! When we got there, check in was quick and easy and the man behind reception spoke English very well. He told us our rooms, gave us a key and off we went to our rooms. The stairs were quite steep (as expected in Amsterdam) and our room was very small and very basic. We shared a twin room but there wasn't much room for anything else except the beds and a TV on the wall. The beds were uncomfortable and squeaked a lot with the slightest bit of movement which was very annoying. The beds were basically fold out beds and were quite low to the floor and after a few days of walking non-stop in Amsterdam, they were the last kind of beds you'd want to go back to!

We went up to the room, passing signs saying drugs were not allowed in the hotel. The room was the smallest hotel room I have ever seen and it was beyond tired. The carpet was gross, I wouldn't walk around without shoes on. The bathroom was about the size of an airplane bathroom if they had a shower. It had a dinky light and you could barely see anything. That was probably good because I don't think it was very clean. The bed was uncomfortable and had an old ratty bedspread that could have used a wash.
