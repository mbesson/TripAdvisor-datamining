First two days were good \u2013 we paid by the credit card for the room (it was rather clean), the breakfast was served to the room (fruit, 2 jogurts, one little cup of flakes (maybe enough for one person, not for two), biscuits, 2 croissants, cappuccino (or coffee, tea by your choice) and juice. But the last morning of our staying, before our departure, they refused to serve us the breakfast without any explanations (the only words we heard: \u201cNo breakfast\u201d. As far as we understand, 3 nights \u2013 3 breakfasts, but we had 3 nights and 2 breakfasts. So we had to find the place to have a snack though we had already paid for it. After such an attitude we\u2019ll certainly never come to this place again, but we had one more booked night after the cruise. We got to the hotel, and the first problem was that they refused to accept the credit card because it was Friday (we do not understand what Friday has to do with credit cards). The next problem \u2013 we paid in cash \u2013 hotel price and extra taxes, but they did not give us any cheque! One more problem was the room \u2013 we have booked double, but got triple room with some problems \u2013 the flush system in WC did not work correctly. Besides, the upper light was so bad that it was twilight in the room \u2013 we returned from the town late in the evening, hoped to pack our things but failed \u2013 eyes got tired, it was really dark in the room, they obviously save on electric light bulbs. The next morning, as one would expect, we had no breakfast \u2013 and again no explanations. In our opinion the only advantage of this so-called hotel is its location \u2013 one can easily get to all sights in old town. This hotel was the worst we have ever stayed at, and unfortunately, it spoiled our impression about Rome.", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scottsdale, Arizona", "Title": "\u201cGood value\u201d", "Author": "KenKratz", "ReviewID": "UR118674972", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel on two different occasions, for several nights.

Tiny modern elevator to the 5th floor reception and rooms 4. Clean, simple rooms and modern clean washroom 5. Had room #38 which I would recommend as it has a very small walk out to a balcony that overlooks an ugly lane but is quiet at night 6. Air conditioning (extra 5 Euro charge) was necessary as the weather was hot and humid 7. Very nice breakfast (for Italy) which included cappiccino, croissants, yoghurt, fruit, juice, cereal) and was delivered to the room at your preferred time 8. Shower was very low-flow 9. Bed was comfortable 10. Sufficient cupboard space for short stay 11. There was a safe in the room 12. Staff were friendly and helpful.

There's only a small sign pasted on the wall, so it's a little difficult to spot especially if you're arriving by car. Just look for Hotel Assisi, which is just next door! After lugging my heavy luggage up/down the stairs in Venice, we totally appreciated the lift in this building. Otherwise we would've cried from lugging it up 5 floors. We arrived at midnight. The door bells were a little confusing though. There were 2 of them, one alongside the rest of the buttons for the other apartments in the building, and the other on a separate \"hotel dell'urbe' box. So when the owner finally responded on the telecom, she only spoke Italian! Which would've been a mighty pickle, if not for our cab driver who helped explain that we wanted to check in. They were pretty pissed that we rung the bell many times and risked waking up the rest of the guests. I called in the morning to inform them though, guess the message was not passed along. Anyhow, all this tension was quickly diffused and another english speaking lady came to help with our check in. And by golly the rooms were CLEAN. I loved that there was no icky carpets but squeaky clean tiles in the room. There was free high speed wifi and we were brought a tasty continental breakfast every morning. Location wise, this hotel was located just across the street from Stazione Termini. Hence it has great connections to airport buses, trains and local buses, and a supermarket! It might get a little noisy at night but you can only hear it if the air conditioning is not switched on.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panevezys, Lithuania", "Title": "\u201cWe like it\u201d", "Author": "irma_u", "ReviewID": "UR113775379", "Content": "neat and clean.

Our MAIN problem was when we got there they wouldn't accept a credit card although their website said nothing about a 'cash only' policy. We reserved the room with a credit card. Giving them cash, of course, meant the room was more expensive than originally thought. If your waist size is more than 34\" you wouldn't be able to sit on the toilet! It was clean enough.

The room was small but clean and the bathroom was the tiniest we have seen so far. The main problem is that we stayed in winter and the heat is turned off every night from 1 am to 7 am. Since we only spent the night at the hotel after a long day's sightseeing, trying to sleep in a freezing room was bad. The second night the owner assured us that he would not turn off the heat but it went off just the same. An extra thin blanket did not help either. The owner stays next door and his wife delivers the morning breakfast to the room which was quite disappointing - coffee, juice, packaged toast and a crossaint.
