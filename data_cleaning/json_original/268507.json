That said, we felt some of the \"polish\" we loved about the hotel from earlier stays was missing, at least this weekend. We arrived at the hotel about 2:00 pm on a Saturday and pulled our car outside the main entrance. We waited for several minutes for a valet/bellman, but no one came out. We unloaded our bags from the trunk and put them on the curb, but still no one from the hotel came. We started to carry in our bags, but couldn't juggle them plus the hotel doors. Once we were partly inside, the concierge came over - she was very pleasant and helped us inside. At the check-in desk, we were told the bellman was \"someplace else\" but someone would park our car when he returned. I thought we might have just arrived at a legitimately poor time while everyone was busy. In our past stays, there has always been someone there greeting guests, holding the door, helping with bags or luggage, etc. However, I can honestly say throughout our stay, there was never a bellman at the front door. It's not a major deal-breaker, and maybe the 10 or so times we past through the front doors were all \"off\" times - still, it's something that really struck us as odd and really something we missed. At check in, I asked whether the hotel could help us with arranging transportation to dinner that night - the gentleman was very polite, but told me they hotel didn't provide transportation but that I would be able to hail a cab myself in front of the hotel. Again, this isn't a major deal, but I found it to be odd and not quite the response I expected. I should also be fair and say when we came downstairs to go to dinner, we talked to the same concierge who helped us through the front doors and she called a cab for us. I want to stress the hotel is beautiful, modern, and in a great location. The fireplace in the lobby was always very welcoming when we came in from the cold. We had drinks and food in Victor twice and found the staff to be very friendly and the food very good. We also ordered room service which was delivered very quick and was excellent as well. We really appreciated the included in-room WiFi, which worked flawlessly. I think the best way to sum up our review is that we previously never gave any thought to staying at any other hotel in Toronto besides Le Germain. In the past, we always felt like we couldn't find better in the city. We very well might stay at Le Germain again and hope this was just an off weekend - however, we will likely at least consider staying at another property next time, which is something we wouldn't have considered before.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cThe choice is easy.\u201d", "Author": "Paul C", "ReviewID": "UR124672694", "Content": "its rare you go to a hotel and everything works perfectly and the staff are terrific.

I stayed here on Saturday night on the recommendation of a friend. The hotel is built in an old warehouse - this means very high ceilings and lots of space. The service upon arriving was fine - the young men greeting us at the door and valet were very polite and helpful. The check- in ladies were also very polite. We had a suite on the 7th floor which we reserved through the hotel website. The room was very spacious - much larger than what you'd expect at a hotel in Europe. We thought the way it was laid out was very clever - however I would change a couple things. #1 - the lighting in the master bathroom is terrible - it is dark. #2 - the shower doesn't have a door (which is fine and quite nice) but the poor design means water leaks out all over the floor. #3 - this suite is positioned directly across from the elevator which makes it noisy at times. #4 - the suite faces south east (which means bright sunshine in the morning which is lovely) however there is a nightclub right below which we could hear until 2am. Breakfast was \"included\" and was served \"continental\" style - cereals, toast, juice, smoked salmon, bagels etc - it was OK, but I thought the lay-out was not good. All in all I don't think I would pick that room for that rate again, but the hotel didn't have any major flaws.

We were immediately impressed with the understated elegance of the hotel and the quiet and friendly staff. Our room also did not disappoint. The decor was much to our personal tastes and we loved the different tiles and impressive fixtures in the bathroom. My only complaint about the room would be that the heavy sliding \"door\" for the toilet enclosure was fairly hard to move owing to its sheer size. And my one caveat would be that with the shower/bath having a glass wall on the side facing the room means that you might unintentionally flash your travel mate (the blind is on the outside of the glass for obvious reasons) and while this may be fun for a couple, could be \"less fun\" for others! While there was some confusion as to our type of booking, the front desk was quick to sort out the problem. We did get some inconsistent information from the front desk as to what time the breakfast was put away, it being for Sunday morning, but they figured it out eventually. We also opted for a late check out time, which gave us an extra hour, but I was impressed that the regular check out time was 12 o'clock. Having arrived too late for dinner before our outing we quickly ordered some room service from the Hotel's restaurant Victor. My husband had some oxtail soup and I just needed some french fries to tide me over...they arrived promptly and were quite delicious. We were disappointed that we wouldn't be able to sample from the menu later when we returned to the hotel as the room service late at night only offers cold foods...fortunately that part of Toronto has plenty of eateries still serving after the midnight hour on a Saturday. Some people have reviewed that the hotel was very noisy on weekend nights due to the clubs across the street, and perhaps they were right? I couldn't say...we were lucky to be on the side of the hotel facing King, and were fairly high up. I was surprised when we arrived on Mercer...aside from The Second City and Wayne Gretzky's further down the street it seemed rather empty...when we came back to the hotel late at night the buildings on Mercer that looked like warehouses were in fact clubs with snaking line ups going down the street...however walking into the hotel (guarded by a friendly doorman) was like walking into a quiet oasis. Our room was also situated next to the elevator (gasp!) but we didn't have a problem with noise at all...no foot traffic noise and no elevator machinery noise! A nice change that shows the quality of material the hotel is built with. The breakfast buffet the next morning was very nice...a definite step up from your typical hotel breakfast layout: real homemade oatmeal, a choice of artisinal jams, real espresso machines were the highlights I remember offhand. Oh and if you get a chance you have to try the automatic coffee machine in the lobby library...not only does it make a million drinks, it can babysit your kids and do your taxes. The Groupe Germain certainly knows a thing or two about hospitality and about the importance of details.

When calling on our own, they only offered late night openings and when we explained this to the Concierge, she had the reservation made and sent to us via email within 2 hours! Each and every time we called with questions prior to our trip, they were more than helpful, and always went the extra mile! We knew at that point that we had chosen the right hotel. From the moment our car dropped us at the door of Le Germain on Mercer Street, the stay was fantastic, and on a scale of 1-10, it is a perfect 20! The hotel is tucked away on a small side street with minimal traffic, but close in proximity to everything a tourist wants to see when visiting Toronto. The staff greeted us with a huge smile and welcome at 9:00 am, when we arrived, which was very early considering rooms are not normally available until afternoon. Not this time...... our room was ready and waiting. We were given our room keys and all the information we would need to know. Our questions were answered, and then some! If we didn't know where to connect with transportation or wanted more information about a tourist attraction, they went out of their way to provide us with whatever we needed, such as, telling us the streetcar and trains only take exact change, and they offered to make change for us. The staff always made sure we were all set with maps and anything else prior to venturing out of the hotel on tours, or sightseeing. They have a wonderful library area where you can relax and have a cup of coffee from their Espresso/Coffee/Hot Chocolate Machine. All the staples needed for your coffee were always well stocked. The first day we arrived, we just wanted to see the library and walked up the stairs to the area. The coffee machine had an \"out of order\" sign placed on it, not that we wanted a cup at that moment, however we did stop at the desk to let them know. The staff responded right away with \"we are so sorry and we will have someone come and repair it right now\". We were taken aback by the prompt response and desire to please their customers! By the way, when we got back later that day, the machine was repaired! Out of all of the hotels we have been to, I would have to say this one has employed the most customer pleasing staff I have seen thus far. They really NEVER said no, or I don't know. The rooms were beautiful, clean, and so unique. The bed was like a piece of heaven! The housekeeping staff were also wonderful, very friendly, and always willing to please. We asked for bottles of water and each day they were left in our room, we never had to ask again. You were made to feel like you were the only guests staying at the hotel. I know the hotel was very busy that week-end because there was a wedding party staying there, but if we had not been told that, we would have never known. You are treated like royalty. If we have the chance to visit Toronto again, we would choose Le Germain and would definitely recommend it to anyone who asks. Thank you to the whole staff of Le Germain for making our first stay in Toronto a wonderful memory!!", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NY", "Title": "\u201cClean and quiet but disappointing\u201d", "Author": "SKA_10", "ReviewID": "UR115458310", "Content": "I chose this hotel based on trip advisor reviews but was disappointed with the quality of our room.

It featured a good sized and powerful shower (the Aveda toiletries are a nice touch, alongside good quality towels and bathrobe) and although the bathroom's glass wall initially felt a bit 'exposed', the floor to ceiling blind coordianted with the blind at the window and gave sufficient privacy while allowing natural light into the bathroom.

The service (check-in, breakfast, phone, room service) was consistently great. I phoned the reception on the second day to ask that the bathroom fan be looked at (because it had a faint but constant rattle to it and there was no switch to turn it off). It was quickly looked at by maintenance and couldn't be readily fixed so I was offered another room (an upgraded one) with apologies for the inconvenience. I hadn't made a big fuss about this either, because it was just mildly irritating. Of note, most of my colleagues stayed at the Royal York and Intercontinental (the 2 hotels recommended by our conference organizers). There was a huge Bollywood festival going on and they reported total chaos. Upon checkin at 4pm, some of their rooms weren't ready until after 10pm! There was excessive noise in and just outside these hotels until past 2:30 am a few nights in a row, so many of them were very sleep-deprived.

There has been sufficient upgrading and refurbishment through the years throughout the hotel. We always enjoy the continental breakfast in the mezzanine room every morning. One thing that has not changed is the heavenly and oh-so-soothing rainforest walk in shower that Le Germain is well known for. The restaurant has gone through changes through the years. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve not eaten there recently, but have frequented the small bar at Victor\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a number of times.

Lots of glass and sunshine - nice to have the natural light. All the treadmills had their own TVs with headphones. They also have an outdoor putting green on the roof for the warmer months.

Even better is a blissful soak in the deep bath or drenching yourself underneath the tropical rainforest-style showerhead. The location is excellent - far enough away from the hustle and bustle of the busy shopping/touristy areas, but close enough to many of Toronto's attractions - including the comedy club, Second City, just across the road. You're also not too far away from both trolley bus stops and the subway. Inside the smart lobby, the staff have always been very courteous and helpful to us. If you have a car, there is valet parking. Up a few stairs is a mezzanine area with a library of art books, free coffee, newspapers and a computer with broadband internet access (very handy if you need to check-in online for your flight home.) Unfortunately, this computer access does tend to be monopolised somewhat if a convention is taking place within the hotel. We also found that the restaurant, Chez Victor, can also be closed occasionally in order to provide conference facilities, which was slightly disappointing on our latest visit. The breakfast doesn't rate as 5 star quality, I'd say, but is a nice enough Continental buffet-style affair. Staff are charming and attentive, making sure that the food is well-stocked and topping you up with tea or coffee.

The staff was very helpful in getting things set up and making sure we had enough dishes in the kitchen, etc. We had a fabulous night and would definitely book there again for that kind of event.

The room set-up wasn't very convenient for more than one person working or dining - there was a small desk, a desk chair and a big armchair. They were happy to bring us an extra chair, but it was still crowded - funny, given the size of the room. Also, the TV didn't pull out or swivel, so if you wanted to watch TV and eat dinner, you had to eat on the bed. Not that important and not the kind of thing you would care about during a short stay - but for a longer stay, it was a little inconvenient. Speaking of the bed - I'm not usually fussy about mattresses, but I personally found our bed the most uncomfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. Too hard for me and it took nearly a week after our stay for the kink to disappear from my neck. We were both working in the room at times and found both the wireless internet and the actual internet port very unstable. Our room was at the end of the hall, far from the elevators.

Although the cheeses and bread were lovely it would have been nice to see some meat protein and some more hot dishes such as eggs (the only eggs were hard boiled) 3.)

The tub was trimmed in black slate, the shower head powerful with multiple settings. One thing I noticed, that towels smelled and looked so clean. I only remember the Four Seasons as having towels that are comparable and not at all Four Seasons. I sometimes travel with my own towels since they never seem to smell clean and I always attriute this to diluted detergent. These towels were clean, soft and fragrant. The details were incomparable to any place I have ever been. Recessed lights, custom furniture. The library has a computer and printer where I printed my color presentation for free. The living rooms downstairs have comfortable white couches with a cozy fireplace. The staff were exceptionally courteous; they went over and above to ensure I had everything. There was an expresso machine for complimentary capaccino, expresso, tea, coffee, etc. in the library and in the breakfast room.

(We enjoy a more neighborhoody, authentic experience, so stayed away from the Bloor Street high couture thing.) We had a standard Queen room, but found it absolutely wonderful. Nothing standard about it -- the best bed I think I've ever slept in, outfitted with high count cotton sheets, down comforter, 4 huge down pillows ... ahhh. There was a large comfortable chair with a large, soft throw, for curling up and reading. One side of the shower is a glass wall (visible from the room, with blinds for the more discrete). The shower itself is wonderful with a choice of either a ceiling rainshower or hand-held shower head that can be attached to a lower level (for shorter people, or those who don't want to wash their hair). There were shelves and cubby holes everywhere in the large room that enabled you to spread out and really claim the space. Also, there were many large drawers and two closets for hanging articles, which also had shelves. There were many small touches throughout the room that showed alot of thought had gone into the design -- for example, a 3-way mirror mounted on the wall at face level that opened like a cabinet and, below that, a drop down shelf to hold make-up or whatever. Also, the lighting was varied and generous. I (as opposed to another post) enjoyed the breakfast food: coffee, expresso, juice, homemade jams, hard-boiled eggs, breads, pastries, bagels, croissants, fruits(citrus' membranes removed), crepes, muesli ... dunno what else you could want, unless you were looking for fried food. There were two servers who were helping all the while and remembered the next day that I liked cappucino with extra milk and brought it over immediately. A nice and welcomed touch.

The houskeeping and waite staff were very good, and the continental breakfast was also above average. The gym, although very limited, was high-tech and very nice;offering free water bottels etc. Of the two problems we had only one can be addressed by the managment. The concierge was not very good, referring to the Toronto magazine for information. (which we had of course already done), we never felt that we received fresh and usefull information. The problem they have that they cannot help, is that there is a rooftop club right across the street, and if you have a room that faces the front of the hotel, you have music and loud people till 2 am, then drunk loud people leaving the club till about 2:30 am. So all in all this is a very nice hotel, just do not depend on the concierge, and request a room facing the back of the building, just remember this hotel is in the entertainment section of Toronto, and there are clubs in every direction!", "Date": "July 26, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil", "Title": "\u201cBest chain in Canada\u201d", "Author": "RobPeixoto", "ReviewID": "UR1854321", "Content": "I stayed at Le Germain Toronto last April.
