One of the small issues that makes this such a wonderful place to stay is the \"No Tipping\" policy. This policy remains the same. I will not be redundant with my comments from last time.

Outstanding property and terrific staff. This is the hotel you would like to stay entire time of your stay without even thinking about going out. Checked in and was greeted as a diamond member. Room was assigned to original booking (King Deluxe), but after politely asked about upgrade, the front desk lady was unsure and went back to check with her manager. When she came out, I was told upgraded to a Waldorf Suite on east side of the 26th floor! As a reward stay, I didn't expect too much but this hotel has surprised me in every possible aspects. The staff is trained with top notch courtesy and professionalism; the details of decor are flawless. The best and yet the most unbelievable part: no tips accepted everywhere in the hotel, except Balsan (restaurant on 3rd floor) that automatically adds 18% gratuity to your entire bill. The house car offers a convenient transportation alternative, with only three restrictions: (1) only drop off, no pick up; (2) first come, first serve, no reservation can be made beforehand; (3) only drive within 2-mile radius of the hotel. Now the downside, the room itself is just a junior suite (anyway, this is a free upgrade for a reward stay and I am totally okay with it), but if you want to throw a party by counting on a \"spacious\" upgrade to a Waldorf suite, you may have to think about it again; the hotel is surrounded by skyscrapers so that the lake view is minimal, if there is any.

I have had the Elysian, now the Waldorf Astoria, on my short list since I first heard and read about it. It currently has the top spot for Chicago on Trip Advisor and was named number one hotel in the US, number seven in the world, by Conde Nast. STAFF: everyone we came in contact with was very polite, helpful, and a pleasure to deal with. There were always a handful of staff at the front desk ready to assist with whatever was needed. I found that they were a joy to deal with but yet not overbearing; a nice blend. Also, a no tipping policy which I like. ROOM: the room - a king bed suite #1410 - was impeccable. An understated but luxurious overall tone. Fireplace is a nice touch. Couch, although little used, was comfortable. Balcony would be great in the summer. The bed and linens were a dream. The iPod/Phone speaker was nice to have for music. The bathroom was elegant with beautiful tile work on the floor and in the spacious shower. The soaking tub was perfect and used for a late night bath. Toiletries high quality. And the robes, super comfortable! AMENITIES: we never made it to the restaurant or bar, unfortunately. Room service breakfast was decent and arrived in less than 20 minutes from the time it was ordered. The coffee and croissants were the highlight. It was great to be able to get the Times on Sunday. The Spa was out of this world! We went for an early morning swim in the lap pool. A few minutes into our swim a gentleman brought in two cups of tea on a platter for us because he thought it would be a nice way for us to wake up. Completely unexpected and a nice touch. Afterwards, we spent some time in the relaxation area - separate women and mens - where the whirlpool, steam room and sauna are. I chilled in the steam room for a bit then headed into the whirlpool; it was so comfortable and elegant I could have spent all day there. OVERALL: I would say my experience with the Waldorf Astoria was top notch. I stayed here for my birthday and I received a very delicious chocolate bar made by the pastry chef and a hand written note from Martin (one of the managers) wishing me a happy birthday. These are the little things I expect when I am paying for a hotel of this caliber. The Waldorf Astoria did not disappoint in any area; it exceeded all my expectations and I would be thrilled to stay here again. Lastly, now I am curious to see how The Trump, The Peninsula, The Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, and Park Hyatt stack up.

We selected this hotel due to its No. 1 rating on trip advisor for Chicago hotels and we were not disappointed. As you would expect with any fine five star hotel the front of house culture and service was excellent. - What i didn't expect when researching the hotel was the relatively low room rate for their top suite compared to similar sized suite's in other major US cities. Premier Gold coast suites are lovely and have a large lounge dining area as well as spacious bedroom and bathroom. - Nice touches included the gas open fire place which we enjoyed as it was snowing outside and the balcony is also a nice touch too, we didn't use it much due to the cold, but we thought it was nice to have in our 23rd floor apartment. - Another nicety at this hotel is that you can open wondows in master bedroom if you prefer to get some fresh air in as distinct from A/C being on all the time. - Obviously, this would be nice in warmenr months. The views of lake Michigan are limited due to the other buildings blocking most of the view, so don't book here expecting lake views. Location is excellent and the best of shopping is just around the corner a brief 2 minute walk away. The hotel is situated very close to Michigan Ave. and the \"Golden mile\" of shops. - Plenty of restaurants and bars close to the hotel as well. The hotel has a house limo which you can use as many times as you wish on a complimentary basis, but you cannot reserve it and its first in best dressed! - That being said, it has a small radius of travel so you don't have to wait long for it if you wish to use it. First night there we ate at RIA - The signature restaurant of the hotel. - What an experience !!! - High end cooking at its finest, but you will need to book about one month prior to your stay to ensure you get in. - Do it if you love fine food and wine, you won't be disappointed ! - We had the degestation menu and asked the Sommellier to upscale us with the best wines in the house. - Unlike some degestation meals the portions are not too big so you don't get half way through and call for the stomach pump ! - The staff are very polished and knowledgable as well as being very upmarket in the manner in which they conduct themselves. Wife and i were very happy with everything and this is one of the best restaurants we have eaten in anywhere. - The dinner is an experience and an event not just a meal and this is what makes it really special. We also tried the spa and once again you will need to book in advance to try this yourself as we just scraped in booking a couple of days out. The concierge ( Al) is very proficient and helpful and assists with everything you need with a minimum amount of fuss and a maximum amount of professionalism. On this trip,so far we have stayed at the Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas, The Park Hyatt Washington DC and the Elysian ( Waldorf Astoria) Chicago. At the moment, i think line honors must go to the Elysian for pure \"bang for bucks\" and this is what i think really gives it an edge. We paid 1/3 of what we paid for our suite in the Mandarin Oriental and 20% of what we paid for our suite at the Park Hyatt in DC, but there was no compromise on service or quality. ! Shhhh, don't tell them or they miay adjust rates ! Now owned by Waldorf Astoria chain, i also was the first to receive Hilton Honors points for this hotel when i checked out on 14/2 so that was just another nice bonus. Don't know what other 5/6 Star hotels in Chicago are like, but hey,based on this experience i wouldn't bother trying to find out. - We will definately stay here on next visit to Chicago.", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cSecond stay with the Elysian\u201d", "Author": "Foodlover9", "ReviewID": "UR124576641", "Content": "We just returned from our second stay at the Elysian.

After a night out on the town, (a very cold night) I decided I wanted to warm up and take a bath. I started to fill up the tub and noticed that it was filthy. There were little black hairs all over and it was dirty. The hotel itself is very clean but my room was not. We were also celebrating a birthday and I had let the hotel know prior to our arrival that it was a special occasion. It went completely ignored by the hotel.

One could not ask for more in room accomodations. The suite was large, well-laid out, with opulent marble baths, superb shower, comfy beds, convenient lighting controls, and a superb fireplace!

We hardly left the hotel for food, as the restaurant/room service were excellent (though not inexpensive). For example, when we ordered toast, it was not warm bread, nor burnt edges, but perfect toast. Every detail of the fruit plate, berry bowl was equally perfect! The friendly driver took us to the Art Institute of Chicago in the hotel's Lexus at a moment's notice. The hotel had booked transportation from O'Hare prior to our arrival, and that went off without any trouble (like always happens in NYC). Housekeeping was non-intrusive, and there was not a water spot or dust particle to be found (I am picky)!

Near Walton, State and Rush street it is on a block with Prada, Hermes and Barney's. The hotel looks and feels brand new. The design is contemporary giving a strong aura of luxury and comfort if you are the person who dresses chic and carries an air of sophistication when you breeze through the lobby. If that person is you then this hotel is your hotel and the exceptional price point will give you everything you are looking for and more. The employees are fantastic at service and not overbearing. They are the right amount of friendly, helpful and present when you need them but not obnoxious, snooty or rude as some high end hotel service can project. Our trip was the weekend after Christmas over New Years. We stayed 3 nights over a weekend. We stayed in the Executive Suite which was appointed with a Fireplace and seating area. We did not use the spa or work out area. The biggest criticism I have about the hotel is their partnership with iPrefer loyalty program. I am a member of iPrefer and booked my stay through their program. That program indicates I should be recognized as an iPrefer member upon arrival, be offered a free upgrade to my room if the hotel has availability and also be offered something in the room welcoming me from iPrefer during my stay. NONE OF THAT HAPPENED. When I checked in the front desk clerk had no clue what I was talking about although my booking and my confirmation had IPrefer and the terms clearly stated on it. None of that was relevant to the front desk. The good: The room was well designed, spacious. Our particular room - Executive Suite - had a bar area fully appointed with sink, ice maker, refrigerator, microwave and stocked with larger size bottles of wine, alcohol and snacks. The bathroom was fantastic. Very comfortable, new and fantastic amenities. The staff outside the hotel where very attentive for door opening, cabs, directions, etc. The building, the entrance and the lobby are super chic. This is an unusually addition to my comments but the cleaning staff did a great job on the room while we were out and about. Toiletries where arranged on a was cloth, clothes and towels where hung on towel bars. Everything was very tidy ever time we returned to our room. The once a day room cleaning and in the afternoon when they do the turndown service, the room was always tidied up when we came back. The bad: The room was warm / hot in the evenings. Our stay was at the end of December and the weather was fairly mild for Chicago. We turned the air down as low as it would go and baked in our room at night. Opening a sliding door we had was the only relief but that made the noise from the street much more apparent. I would guess they add something to the air flow for scent that at first was an interesting touch. So when you walk in your room it has a nice aroma. However I did notice when we first arrived the bathroom and shower area had a slight bad odor but that went away after our first use. Not making that a big deal by any stretch but the combination of the air scent and the bathroom scent freaked me out at first but again it was fine after the first use of the shower and I actually came to enjoy the freshener scent when walking into the room. Enjoy your stay if you go to the Elysian. I highly recommend it as a destination in Chicago. For the money, we thought it was worth it. I would return if I could get some restitution with my iPefer loyalty program and the hotel management. Otherwise the price point of this hotel and the Peninsula are comparable and they are different experiences but both very good for our style and taste.", "Date": "January 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai, China", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service\u201d", "Author": "Plinia", "ReviewID": "UR122705969", "Content": "Very nice hotel with excellent service staff!

We have been die hard fans of the Park Hyatt Chicago for years, but thought we would try something new this year. The Elysian did not disappoint. I made our reservation on line back in October and bought a City Experience package, which included free breakfast and $25 hotel credit. I recommend that as we made the extra charge back on breakfast alone. A few days before our arrival, I received a call from the hotel to confirm our arrival and ask if there were any special services our arrangements we needed made. He also told me that they had already upgraded us into a suite, which was a wonderful surprise. On arrival, the great service continued.....and never stopped. The entire team at the Elysian is amazing and friendly. The hotel itself is beautiful!! Our room had a full bar, fireplace, great sound system, amazing bathroom. I think every room in the hotel has a fireplace. We didn't have time to explore the spa, but the restaurants are amazing, but bring your big wallet. It's not cheap to eat and drink there, but if you can handle the price tag, it's worth it. Overall, it is a very expensive place to stay, but there were no regrets when the final bill came. This is a NO TIPPING hotel, which we found a bit odd at first. I had to verify at the front desk that it was true. At the restaurants, there is an 18% gratuity added on to everything, so no need to get out your calcluator. We did add on several more percentage points to the tip (which is allowed), as the service was well beyond 18%.

Sophisticated public spaces, dining options, spa facilities, and a smart bar. At least 6 months in advance, I reserved an executive suite (for me) and a king room (for my business associate) for 3 nights to coincide with a major meeting we were attending at McCormick. The staff did a first rate job of arranging in advance my wine selections for an important client dinner at Ria as well as an in suite wine tasting and buffet for another client. Bravo! The fit and finish, and attention to detail in my suite were most appreciated. Sound perfect? Why not a 5 star review? There were just enough hiccups to hold me back from giving a perfect mark to the Elysian. 1) A few weeks before arrival, I received a confirmation email for my associated but not me. When I called the hotel they had mis-dated my arrival, even though the original confirmation was correct. They made the correction immediately and I was still able to secure an Executive suite for the correct dates, but if I didn't call to check, I might have arrived at the hotel without my reserved suite or a room at all. 2) The clock in my bedroom was off (in the wrong direction) by 10 minutes. I was using it as a guide as I prepared for a business breakfast off site the first morning. We discovered the issue as I arrived in the lobby 10 minutes late, with my associate pacing nervously. We were almost tardy for our meeting and felt rushed. 3) They ran out of potato chips in the bar during the after work rush and we were provided a martini up as opposed to over the rocks as ordered. They were a bit in the weeds, as they say. 4) Balsan breakfast was a weak link. Corned beef hash with poached eggs arrived with scrambled eggs after an earlier snafu by the kitchen (the plate exploded). Around the dining room & at out tables, dirty plates were very slow to be cleared at numerous business breakfast tables. 5) Despite a very comprehensive mini bar (w/ microwave), there is no way to make hot water for morning tea or coffee in your room.

The first night I heard booming music until the wee hours of the morning. I thought it was from some nearby club, but I was told by the front desk that it must have been the wedding reception. The hotel offered a complimentary breakfast, but since we were otherwise so comfortable in our room, we declined, but thanked them for the gesture. In addition, Bernard\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (that I have read so many nice things about) was closed on the last night of our stay at the hotel (Sunday) so we decided to have a nightcap at Balsan. Big mistake \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the service was horrible. It was only semi-crowded but it was like amateur night behind the bar. This hotel can do so much better than that. We like to blend in with the locals when we are out-of-town and this hotel makes that a very easy thing to do since it is away from Michigan Avenue but within close walking distance to all of the high-end shopping and many great restaurants.

A walgreens across the street and a supermarket 1.5 blocks away are very convenient. The restaurant RIA is out of this world. Staff are highly helpful and polite. Internet speeds were outstanding, better than Trump. A few issues. The housekeeping people were often not very thorough. Perhaps this has to do with the no-tip policy? Once for turndown service they tried to just make up the bed and drop off bottles of water. As they were leaving I asked if they could put new towels in the bathroom, empty the trash cans, etc. The lady asked me \"Was this room already made up today?\" I said \"Yes, but we've been using it since then.\" They skipped corners on cleaning up during regular room cleaning, too. Also the light management system is irritating. Instead of simple switches and dimmers for the lights, they put in a space age system with up to 5 buttons for all the rooms with various presets. The big problem is that pushing \"all on/off\" in a suite affects all lights in all rooms of the suite, bathroom, bedroom, and living room. I really hated it when I was trying to sleep in the bedroom and someone in living room hits the \"all on\" button. Or when bathing with the lights off or low, and someone similarly hits \"all on\". What is the purpose of this system? If people wanted their lights to work this way, then people would have this system in their houses. Anyway I dont want to gripe too much. An excellent stay, beautiful rooms. Overall I would still give the trump a slight edge in luxury. The kitchens at the trump are far larger and much much better appointed, no comparison. This hotel has better lighting in the rooms, though. I found it impossible to get enough light in Trump at night even with extra lights. Overall this is a great property. I liked the no-tip policy, made things easier and I dont like having to worry about managing a small bills supply all the time.

The only thing I would recommend to check in clerk to be sure before surprising guests with upgrade. We were told that we were upgraded by 4 categories up when indeed it wasn't an upgrade at all, not even by one category, we stayed in the Executive Suite the exact accommodation we booked with hotel. Therefore, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stay in Premier Gold Coast Suite, or even Gold Coast Suite which would have been nice to have been upgraded to. Sorry, but I always do my homework and was familiar with all rooms' pictures and layouts. I inquired about our suite 3 times if this was indeed upgrade by 4 categories up and was told yes. I only hope that the check in clerk didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the knowledge or perhaps innocently wasn't aware and merely read what was in the profile. In such situations, I prefer to remain silent and concentrate on all the good. Nevertheless, we were happy with the floor we stayed on, with the view which is very important to me, and I didn't tell my husband that we were not upgraded just not to spoil the momentum as one little thing like this can through you off\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Executive suit was more than enough: specious, plenty of closets for our designer clothes - one big near the entry door and 2 individual closets across from bathroom. The bathroom was huge. The room was very clean every day. The furnishings/furniture, decor were in calm tones and all blended perfectly without any pieces outstanding the other thus creating pleasant atmosphere. I am not a picky type and never look for needle in the hey to find imperfections and instead see things beautiful and they were. The room had two true HD flat screen TV and 1 TV in the bathroom mirror, if you had stayed in new or refurbished hotels then you probably have seen TV in the mirror already, but in this hotel the picture was clear compare to other hotels we stayed in. We had gas fireplace which shots off by itself in case you foll a sleep. If you are cold at night there are down comforters in the closet. The art in the room was OK. The bathroom had good size sunken bath, separate shower with not see through glass in case some worry, nice vanity counter and sink. Marble all over. Finally comfortable bed and pillows. We loved everything about our room. Anyway, we were told if we were not happy with the view or room to let the desk know and we would be offered another room, which is incredibly nice gesture; however, we were pleasantly happy to find out that our accommodation was already held for us and had a personal touch and care put into making it especially for us. In all, our stay was beyond our expectations. Thank you for early check in, we needed it as we slept only 2 hours. Thank you for late check out as due to my disability, it took me quite longer to pack than I anticipated, plus the living area was so comfy that it made us lazy during our stay. Thank you to every door person for kindness/hospitality and addressing me by my name from the moment we arrived that's what you call service with class. Thank you Dominique in Balsam the best waiter ever, we miss you already. Thank you to (forgot name) for the greatest facial ever - Age defying facial - I am back looking great again. Starting my vacation spending 3 hours in the spa was the greatest thing I have ever done for myself and highly recommend to all, because later you will not have time for the spa. Sorry I fell asleep during facial\u00ef\ufffd\u0160 The entire spa experience was more than 5 stars: very clean, assistance from stuff and so much more, all in all that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s how the spa should be. By the way the lap pool and pool area looks much better than on the picture. Just so happy that I finally was able to visit Chicago and stay in the hotel of such caliber. No tipping is excellent idea. Less headache and many may not realize, some people manage to drop things during tipping, happened to my mom once, she left money pouch in the taxi.

The hotel has a young staff who obviously take immense pride in their hotel - they always looked happy and came across as very enthusiastic. The rooms and linens were sparkling clean however the towels could have been softer / fluffier. The beds were comfortable, however one side was very well used and it won't be long before the mattress will need replacing. The elevators were small and there were only two which resulted in a very long wait at busy times. We thought the parking was good value and cheaper than a number of other hotels in the city, especially as they park the vehicles on site so they're available at a minutes notice (at other hotels it can take at least 15 minutes to get your car) The location is very good - less than 5 minutes slow walk to the best shopping on Michigan Ave, but on a quiet street with a park only a block away. Room service provided great food and it always arrived at the exact time it was ordered for.

Short walk to highest level Chicago shopping and restaurants. Grand driveway entrance that is easy to pull in and out of - rare in that area of the city. Lobby is small and intimate compared to Peninsula or FS. We stayed in a Superior one bedroom suite with a terrace which was an upgrade. Bathroom was great, with Asprey amenities and TV behind the mirror was fun to have for morning news. Internet service was good and free. Parking is $50/ night which seemed high as it was equal to our BMW rental. Good sound system in the bedroom. We had a nice view of Hancock with partial lake view.We were told that this was one of the best views in the hotel. If that was the case both the FS ( equally good location) and even Trump ( closer to the loop) where I have stayed on prior trips have far superior/more dramatic lake/river/city views. I had booked the suite that was one room with a fireplace in the middle which definitely gives a more open feel and would recommend that room type. Spa/ gym/ locker area were excellent, pool is a one lane lap pool. Much bigger indoor pools at both the FS and Peninsula. Service is supposed to be great at this hotel. We were a a little disappointed. Two of four days we had trouble with the fireplace in the room and engineering had to come three times to fix it. The concierge was difficult to access by phone and we had to wait for them to return calls several times. They also left at 7 30 at night which was before our dinner hour made it difficult for dinner arrangements, adjustments in time, directions etc where we ended up working with the phone operator or calling for ourselves. In general they have a policy that anyone can help you with everything but that is not always the case in fact. Getting things like a plastic bag were more of a hassle than they should have been. They seem to try and want to help, but a phone operator or front desk staff is not a concierge or housekeeping. They are helpful and nice on the phone but don't always know what you want or if they have it so simple things take several calls. We went to the bar twice and the room was full. We waited 35 min for a drink and it came completely wrong ( martini instead of highball on the rocks as requested) with the waitress gushing about how great it was. After waiting so long we just paid took it and went up to the room in order to get out of a very small crowded space. Really not a great bar to bring another couple for drinks b/c on every night we were there it was difficult to seat for and get drinks. There are many nearby hotels that have great bars to host guests. Room service bkfst was fine. In the restaurant we had a very surly waitress who dropped a plate on my glasses, brought creme fraiche instead of sour cream with berries and insisted there was no sour cream in the hotel though we had it two prior days with room service and brought out 2 omeletes of 4 for the same table about five minutes apart and when asked about the others said she only had two hands. There is a great low-key neighborhood brkfst spot around the corner though - Tempo. We did not try the Michelin starred Ria b/c we were told by the concierge on the first of four nights that it would be difficult to get in between 7:45 and 9:00. We were surprised hotel guests don't have priority access to the restaurant so if you want to go, book at the time of your reservation. We requested and were told we could have a late checkout at 4:00 when we checked in. Then when we confirmed they asked if we could move it back to 3:00 b/c they had lots of other check-ins. We found this a little unusual but when we called back and asked if they could honor the original check-out time so we could shower before our flight in the room they were agreeable. We travel to Chicago frequently and may return to the Elysian b/c of the convenient location, depending on rates etc. However, there are nearby properties with much more seasoned staff, more available concierges for longer hours, easier access to restaurants etc that just seem to make things flow much more seamlessly.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cThe ultimate in a luxury hotel!\u201d", "Author": "travelinluxury54", "ReviewID": "UR120078412", "Content": "I just stayed at the Elysian for 4 fabulous days.

We can only compare the Elysian to hotels with fewer amenities. We were looking for a hotel with a great location and one that was more than a place to sleep. This was our first ever family vacation together and we wanted it to be special and unforgettable. We looked at four star hotels and were going to book one of those. They were more in our price range yet still had adequate amenities. Then I looked at the Elysian and read through almost every review on TripAdvisor. At that point, I was hooked. This was the hotel for us. We prepaid in advance and received a substantial discount on our room (Executive Suite). I also signed up for iPrefer (iPrefer.com - free membership) in hopes of a complimentary upgrade. We arrived to the hotel quite early, but were able to drop off our luggage. We were even offered a ride to our first destination in the complimentary Lexus (it is available for trips less than 2 miles). After sightseeing for a while, we returned to the hotel to see if our room was ready. It was about an hour before normal check-in time and it was ready. We also received a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe Suite and our luggage was already in our room. Shortly after settling ourselves in our room, the doorbell rang. A gentleman presented our son with a welcome treat and also presented all of us a note from the general manager of the hotel. My son already loved the hotel, but the treat sealed the deal forever. The room was fantastic. Since I heavily researched the Elysian in advance, I knew what to expect but actually being there exceeded every expectation of the rooms. The Deluxe Suite was very large with plenty of room for the three of us. I have stayed in Chicago a few times before in other hotels and did not sleep well due to outside noise. That was not an issue with this hotel. The room was nice and quiet. We were treated with respect and courtesy by the Elysian staff everywhere we went. I have to admit that I was a little nervous to stay at the Elysian since we've never stayed at a hotel of this calibur before. That nervousness was eased with every interaction with the staff. Every service-related business should strive to have employees such as those at the Elysian. They are truly special and top-notch! We ate at the Balsan one night and had room service one morning. Both meals were great and again the service was first-rate. My only regret is that we didn't eat at the hotel more often during our trip to try more of the offerings. The Elysian has so many wonderful things going for it. It deserves every accolade it has received thus far and I expect it to receive many more. Our stay was unforgettable - exactly what we had hoped.

Clearly, it's an exclusive hotel and you feel that from the moment you arrive at the off-street, discreetly hidden courtyard entrance. To blend seamlessly into the picture there, and for other reasons, I recommend hiring a private car to drop you off. There were very few taxis dropping off guests. I was one of them and I quickly noticed that black Town Cars were the car of choice for Elysian guests. Also, the taxi was dirty with poor heat and bad air freshener. I had to give the driver directions to the hotel, one of the most famous in Chicago. I regretted the taxi decision on many levels. So my advice is spring for the Town Car. Once the taxi stops, two doormen whisk you out of the car with great cheer and an enthusiastic welcome. They couldn't have known my name but I somehow remember being called by name by each member of the hotel staff I encountered during my stay. The check-in was seamless and I was quickly taken to my King room, which was huge and immediately pleasing. Entering the room there's a large closet on the right with safe, robe, all the amenities. Then a wet bar with sink, glasses, treats, etc. On the left is the bathroom, quite spectacular. Beautiful marble, walk in shower, large tub and a feature I've never seen before. There's a TV in the mirror. You just lie in the tub or put your makeup on while watching CNN or a movie in the lower right-hand part of the mirror. Very cool, very trick. Also, you just have to wave the room key over a sensor to unlock the door. (You don't even have to take it out of its envelope.) None of that pushing in, pulling out, getting the dreaded red light, trying to get the timing right. The room is decorated in neutral colors, black, brown, gray, ivory. The furniture is modernist and minimalist. I wasn't entirely keen on it. I found it a little cold. Perhaps a splash of color somewhere, something fanciful would help. It was luxurious but austere. There's an enormous full length mirror in the bedroom that was splendid. It was wide and covered a good bit of the wall between the windows. An unusual pleasure. There's a fireplace, a couple of sitting chairs, a desk, an iPod deck. My iPod deck didn't work. They fixed it within 10 minutes. They left a bottle of water at turndown, very welcome, but they didn't leave a chocolate, which I missed. A small point but it seemed out of step for a luxury hotel. The bed was supremely comfortable, loads of pillows and lovely linens. The location of the hotel for downtown is perfect. A story about the level of service at the hotel: On my day of departure I returned late, rushing for the airport with far more purchased items that I had room to pack. I was in a panic. The staff jumped into action, helped me quickly condense my packing (discreetly in the lounge no less since I had checked out of my room earlier), throwing away excess packaging, finding a box, tape and so on. I did make my flight, but only because the staff helped me. It was really extraordinary. They were so efficient and so kind about it.

Accommodations very nice -- clean and comfortable. Lighting system a little tricky to learn, but that makes it more interesting. Staff exceedingly polite and courteous, always ready to help, but perhaps a bit too prissy and outgoing for me. But I'm not everyone. Most guests probably love that type of fawning attention. To me, it's annoying. I certainly don't expect -- or believe -- Elysian staff should change its personable ways simply because I think it should! Furniture in suite very nice and comfortable, although bed was a little too soft for me. Plenty of closet and drawer space for at least two people. Bathroom very nice with two vanities, counter and drawers, very deep soaking tub and extra-large shower stall. Also a separate powder room. Water pressure good and hot at all times of day. No type of radio in the room -- just iPod docking system which would have been nice had I brought an iPod, which I didn't. Two TVs, both 42', although only one in living room was HD. No big deal. Good selection of channels. DVD player had been set up in living room per my request prior to arrival. Comfortable couch in living room, plus an easy chair and dining table that seemed somehow misplaced (awkwardly) in corner of room. Living room area most likely not large enough to place all chairs, tables, etc..., at most proper setting. Furnished terrace/balcony was nice, but view into parking garage and fire escape of adjacent building not exactly breathtaking! Bar has a couple drinking glasses, plus wine glasses, freezer drawer with ice cubes. Mini bar fridge has little room for your own items. Don't worry; no sensor to run up your tab if you so much as look at any of the items in mini bar. Fitness room a bit disappointing for me, a workout buff. Doesn't have the weightlifting machines a serious fitness guy would appreciate. Had Sunday brunch at Balsan, and should have taken advice of earlier reviewer who warned against the French Toast. Suggestion: if you do order it, close your eyes, take a few bites, and ask yourself: 'Is this French Toast!' In any event, service and friendliness of people working there very good. Judging by majority of reviews herewith, most travelers who stay at Elysian will be delighted. I would think this place would be especially attractive and comfortable during the winter months.

They were always smiling and came to introduce themselves to our kids. The rooms were so comfortable and beautifully decorated. The bathrooms were expansive and modern, and my husband couldn't get over the TV in the mirror. One of the highlights of the trip was the spa. It is one of the nicest hotel spa experiences I can remember, and quite possibly the best massage I've ever had. A few above and beyond things to note. I had asked if we could get high chairs in our suite to feed the kids. Not only were there three high chairs, but it was almost as if they went out and bought brand new ones that day. They obviously had never been used, and they went out of their way to suit our needs. They also brought all of the kids stuffed animals and juice. My babysitter's boyfriend had textbooks in his room and housekeeping accidentally dropped one of his books and tore a page. They called him to apologize profusely, and he wasn't worried about it. He did proceed to ask about a place nearby where he could find a cubs hat. Later that afternoon, they delivered one to his room as an apology for the minor incident.

There was absolutely no line at reception. I mentioned that I booked my room with Perfect Escapes, which offers an early check in, late check out, and free room upgrade. Since I paid for an Executive Suite, I was upgraded to a Gold Coast Suite. The young man at reception was friendly and efficient. The Gold Coast Suite (#1401) was certainly beautiful...elegant, understated and very comfortable. I noticed, however, that while spacious, it certainly did not seem like the advertised 915 square feet. I called down to the front desk to make sure that I was indeed in a Gold Coast Suite and they assured me that I was. Since I wanted more space, I requested an upgrade to a Deluxe Suite(1124 square feet), for an extra $75. An employee came up to my room, showed me my new suite, and got me a new key card. The Deluxe Suite (#2404) was on a high floor with a furnished terrace and a lovely view. The bathroom was beautiful, but smaller than the ones I've seen in other 5 star hotels. The fireplace didn't work...a minor disappointment. Once again, however, my Deluxe suite certainly didn't seem to be the advertised square footage...1124 square feet. Later that afternoon, I realized that I had forgotten one of my prescriptions at my apt here in Chicago. Out of sheer curiosity, I also picked up my tape measure. When I returned to the hotel, I measured every space; including all closets, hallways, foyer, and the terrace. Long story short: The Deluxe Suite is 905 square feet, NOT 1124 square feet. This may seem anal, but one expects a hotel the caliber of the Elysian to have accurate statistics on each of their room types. This realization was very disappointing, and put a damper on my birthday celebration. For this reason, I am forced to give the Elysian a 3 star rating. I'm sure the inaccuracies concerning square footage are not an intentional deception on the part of the hotel, but I sincerely hope that in the near future, the Elysian will publish accurate square footage statistics on its website.

The Elysian lived up to those reviews and provided one of the best lodging experiences we have ever enjoyed. We have had the good fortune to stay in some of the finest hotels in our travels. Places like the St. Regis in NYC and the Saint James in Montreal. The Elysian ranks with those kind of properties but provides a contemporary environment. The hotel's features are well documented in other reviews so I won't repeat them here. The design of the rooms and the amenites are absolutely first class and the small balcony was a welcome feature. The really impressive thing about the Elysian is the hotel staff. We often read about the quality of hotel staff in reviews and it is usually hard to quantify. Not so at the Elysian. The amazing thing at this hotel is that the staff is largely young adults. The management and owners have clearly developed a training and hiring system that selects extremely well educated and personable individuals. More importantly, the hotel then trains them extensively resulting in the most friendly, helpful, and efficient staff possible. It is a rare thing these days to find an organization that values the quality of it's employees so highly. It is an old fashioned approach to success that is as important as the quality of the product. The impressive thing about the Elysian is not tv's in mirrors or the no tipping policy. The reason we would return again in a heartbeat is that the ownership and top management have a plan, a very good plan, for delivering great hospitality, in a first class physical plant, employing state of the art design, all based on a foundation of extremely well trained and selected staff.", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco, California", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel in a great location\u201d", "Author": "Anomina", "ReviewID": "UR115964820", "Content": "This hotel is perfect.

To start with we sent some of our clothes to the hotel via UPS in advance so we could just take carry on luggage with us. The amazing staff at the Elysian called me when our clothes arrived to let me know that a bottle of sunscreen had spilled onto a few items of clothing. But, they were quick to tell me, they had cleaned it off and had the clothes, cleaned, pressed and ready for our stay. When we arrived they were hanging in our closet. Amazing. When we arrived, the manager had left us a hand written note welcoming us to the hotel. We also received notes each day reminding us of dinner reservations, spa treatments, etc. Every note was handwritten. The staff is amazing. Apparently the hotel philosophy is that each guest should feel like an honored guest in a friend's home. So, no employee will accept tips (that is already factored into each service), and they are encouraged to connect with guests on a personal level and to try to find ways to amaze and delight the guests. They succeed at every turn. One thing they thought of is to eliminate ice machines on guest floors because they tend to be loud. Instead, each room has a bar with an ice compartment - they keep it filled with ice for you. The room service menu is like none I have ever tasted....the food comes from the same kitchen that serves their Michelin 2 star restaurant in the hotel. Especially loved the breakfast and the pasta with bolognese (sp) sauce. The spa is incredible. Great service and every treatment is a pleasure. I had my hair done 2X by Christina and all I can say is that the next time I go I may not even waste space in my luggage by taking a hair dryer. She made me look and feel like a supermodel. I could go on an on with examples of Elysian's excellence but you should experience it for yourself. Top quality sheets, towels, and comfortable furniture. Oh, and my favorite was the TV-in-the mirror in the bathroom so you can watch TV while you fix your makeup or from the bathtub. So cool.

For the amount they invested in the electrics & automation, this seems like a strange oversight. The inclusion of a small balcony was nice, as was the fireplace.

My daughter and I stayed for two nights. Our trip was booked through the hotel directly at the low price of $225/night prepaid. They obviously knew we had paid a discount rate and that did not appear to have any influence upon how we were treated. They gave me the feeling that I was a celebrity. We arrived extremely early (before noon) and were taken immediately to our room. The double queen room had more square footage than our recently sold Printer's row apartment. Clean, calming, extremely comfortable in every sense. Fabulous bathrobes, thick luxurious towels (and plenty of them). Bathroom was outstanding with the double sinks, massive shower and huge soaking tub. The bar area was incredible with the refrigerator drawers completely stocked. My first regret is my daughter is underage and therefore, we had to pass on partaking of the myriad of tasty beverages provided. Next time..... The service was excellent. Our luggage was brought to our room by this tiny darling young woman. She heaved those 75 pound suitcases onto the suitcase racks without batting an eyelash. I am sure they weighed more than she did. I was politely informed that there is a no-tipping policy at the hotel. I must say, that did surprise me. We were greeted by name every time we went in or out. I contacted the concierge both nights to get a recommendation and reservation for dinner. We enjoyed fine meals at Pelago and Rosebud Steakhouse. I would not have chosen either of these places on my own. A pink envelope containing our reservation details was slipped under our door both nights. The room was technologically stunning: lighting panels, HD TV/DVR, TV in the bathroom behind the mirror, and WiFi that worked great. Departure was a breeze. We were running late returning to the hotel to check out, so I telephoned them to gather our belongings. When we got back to the hotel we were given ice cold water (temp that day in the Windy City was 102 degrees), and informed that our bags were loaded and a cab was waiting. Wow. My second regret is leaving this hotel and moving to Hyde Park. This was a college tour for us. Huge mistake.

But I am fascinated by the apparently near-unanimous glowing support from prior guests, and accounts of beyond-the-call-of-duty service, that contrast so greatly with my own experience. My wife and I have three young girls at home, and we are both working professionals. Our family is always our first priority, and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get too much time to ourselves. But we try to take at least one long weekend together each year. Recently, Chicago has been our destination of choice\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth for our couple\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s get away and for at least one trip per year with the kids. In 2009 we stayed at the Peninsula and enjoyed it very much. We have also stayed at many other hotels in the Magnificent Mile/Gold Coast/River North area. When we were planning our trip last fall, however, we read about the Elysian and, based on the excellent reviews, booked a three night stay in early November. I thought about writing a review immediately after our stay. Not to bash on the hotel, which it certainly doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t deserve, but to give readers a different perspective and perhaps reduce expectations to a reasonable level. Unfortunately, the demands of returning to work prevented that from happening and my energy for writing the review faded. We are now planning our next trip to Chicago (this one with our children). In connection with trying to decide where to stay, I encountered more stories of the Elysian\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s top notch service, and I felt obligated to share my experience. Here is my story: We arrived at the hotel about midday on Thursday. Like many others, we were immediately impressed with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lobby and exterior. As I recall, there were no other guests checking in at the time. There were two employees at the desk. One was on the pone and the other was looking at her computer screen or something else on the desk. They appeared to be busy with whatever they were doing. We weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t immediately helped or acknowledged while we waited at the desk. No \u00e2\u20ac\u0153welcome to the Elysian, I will be right with you\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd or similar greeting. This wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a problem for us, as we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t in any particular hurry. But I am sure many people would have been bothered by the lack of acknowledgement. After a couple of minutes, one of the employees at the desk greeted us and proceeded to check us in. When she was done with the check in process it became clear that a mistake had been made, when she showed me a confirmation for a single room rate, rather than for the suite we had booked. After a while, we discovered that someone else with my same last name had a reservation too, and this had caused some confusion. This would explain why the lady at the desk referred to my wife by someone else\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first name when she looked us up in the computer. If my wife was a more suspicious woman, I could have been in some trouble. After learning that my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name was not what showed up in the reservation that she was looking at, the clerk changed my wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name in the computer (but this was before she discovered that she was looking at the wrong reservation). I only hope that when she discovered the mistake, she went back into the other person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reservation and changed his wife\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name back. Eventually, the desk clerk found our correct reservation and we got things straightened out. But my wife (who was 6 months pregnant) and I waited 20 to 30 minutes during this whole process. The employee was polite and apologetic enough during this time, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upset, and I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that the service was terrible. But based on all the accolades and stories of exceptional service, this was not the start to our stay that I had expected. You would think that someone might at least have offered my pregnant wife a chair to sit in while we waited. She was fine, and was probably happy to stand after sitting on the flight and the trip to the hotel. But, in any event, the offer wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t made. When the recheck-in process was done, the employee handed us our room keys. I noticed that our room was three to four floors below where I thought we should be, based on what I had been told prior to placing my reservation. It has been long enough since my stay at the Elysian that I do not recall for sure what the room we paid for was called. But my recollection is that we paid for a premier suite. Whatever the room was called, I had contacted the hotel to prior to booking to confirm the difference between the various levels of suites, and was informed that the suite I was booking would be on or above a certain floor. But by this point I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to go through the process of checking-in for a third time, so we just went to our room. The room itself was fantastic. And in that way (size, d\u00c3\u00a9cor, and amenities) the Elysian lives up to the hype that has been created for it. Our view, on the other hand, was of the top of a parking garage and the back of an adjacent building. See the attached photos. As I recall, we were facing to the southeast. We wound up keeping the shades closed pretty much the whole trip. If I had it to do over again, I would have gone back down and asked for a room on a higher floor. But we were tired and hungry, and I am not usually one to complain. I deal with confrontation all day at work. The last thing I need is more confrontation on vacation. And given the cool weather, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t plan on using the balcony much anyway. In hindsight, however, moving to another room might have solved the fireplace issue described below, and that would have been worth the trouble. When my wife and I returned from lunch that first day, there was a tray of fruit, cheese and meat of some kind in our room, along with an envelope with my last name on it. In the envelope was a gift certificate to the hotel restaurant and a confirmation for a reservation for four for that evening. I had not made the reservation, and had no reason for a table for four. The hotel had again mistaken me for the guest with my same last name. I had to call the desk to get this straightened out, and to make sure that they had the right person linked to our room in the hotel computer\u00e2\u20ac\u201dso that calls and other services would be directed appropriately. Because of the misunderstanding, my wife and I were never sure if the food tray was a check-in perk, or if it was something the other guest had paid for. Eventually we ate some of the food on the tray and left it for housekeeping. The tray (with its leftover contents) was with us for the entire stay, and became sort of a joke between my wife and I. Every time we left the room we would try to make it more and more obvious that we were done with it (wadding up napkins on top of the tray, putting it on the floor, etc.), and yet the tray would always be there when we returned to the room. This didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t upset me. It was just kind of funny and, again, seemed not in keeping with the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation. This brings me to the fire place issue I mentioned above. The fire place, along with the bathtub (which did not disappoint), was one of the main reasons that we booked our room at the Elysian. It worked fine, but almost immediately filled the room with a gas-type smell. We got used to the smell in a few minutes, but when we returned to the room, even after being gone for a couple of hours (with the fireplace off), the smell was lingering. And if the fireplace was on long enough, I started to feel a little light-headed. On our way out on the first evening of our stay, we asked a gentleman at the desk if our experience with the fireplace was normal. Based on what I had heard about service at the hotel, I was expecting him to express some concern, have someone check it out, or perhaps inquire about whether we should be moved to another room. But he was dismissive of the issue, and informed us that the fireplaces do that if they run for a significant period of time. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if all of the fire paces at the Elysian have that problem, or if he didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appreciate the significance of the smell in our room. But we did not get any benefit from the fireplace during our stay. Before booking the room, I had heard about a guest at the Elysian who had forgotten to bring a charger for her iphone. After asking the hotel where she could get one, they offered to drive her to the Apple Store in the Hotel BMW. If I recall correctly, the guest wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ready to go to the store yet and, before she got ready, someone from the hotel went to the Apple Store, purchased a charger for her, and brought it to her room on a little tray. It was stories like this that led me to believe that my wife and I would be staying in Nirvana when we booked our room. As coincidence would have it, I too needed something for an iphone while I was at the hotel. And because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d heard the story mentioned above, I thought I would see if I would get the same treatment. I stopped at the concierge desk, told them what I needed, and asked what would be the best way to get to the Apple Store to get it. Cab or walk was the response I received. I love walking around in Chicago, so that was okay. But, again, not the over-the-top service that the hotel is consistently noted to have. Sometime during our stay, there was a message on our phone, indicating that I needed to call the front desk. When I did, I was informed that the hotel had forgotten to run my credit card at check-in, to cover incidental expenses (I had prepaid for the room itself). I was then told that I needed to stop by the front desk to take care of it at my convenience. At that point, I believe my wife and I were in for the evening, so I had to make a special trip downstairs to take care of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s check-in oversight. I was happy to do that, and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big inconvenience. But based on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reputation for excellent service, I would have expected someone to offer to come to my room to get my card and then bring it back, or to simply handle the matter at checkout. Other than the issues addressed above, our stay was fine. We loved the room (other than the view and fireplace), and the restaurant let us take a dessert back to our room, even though room service was either not running at that time or did not offer that dessert. My wife appreciated that. That is my story. Nothing horrible. No cause for a two-star rating, or a warning not to stay at the hotel. We just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t experience the exceptional service that so many others seem to have. No one at the hotel knew, or at least no one referred to me by, my name other than at check-in and check-out, or seemed to go out of their way to make us feel welcome. Again, for me that was not much of a problem. Many of the differences between a four and five star hotel are lost or wasted on me. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mind a hotel staff that is not interactive or over-the-top polite. In fact, sometimes that can be annoying. But a more discerning guest who had my experience may perceive that as poor service for a world class hotel. The contrast between the reports of exceptional service that I have heard, and my own experience, has led me to wonder what accounts for the difference. I have come up with two possibilities. The first is simply that by random chance or dumb luck, our stay was the exception that proves the rule of outstanding service. I assume that this is the case. The other possibility is that because I received a discounted rate through hotels.com (or some similar site) I was not recognized or treated as a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153special guest.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd I have wondered whether this is something that the hotel staff is aware of through the reservation process, and either consciously or subconsciously treats \u00e2\u20ac\u0153full-rate\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd guests better than those paying a discounted rate. I know that certain guests will always get the star treatment, as they should. Someone paying for the presidential suit should be treated like a president. I just wonder whether the over-the-top service described by so many\u00e2\u20ac\u201das opposed to polite greetings, opening doors, and other service you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d expect from any nice hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u201dis reserved for higher paying guests, or ones who at least paid full room rates. I hope and expect that such is not the case. But I do imagine that Lawrence Fishburn (who we had the pleasure of riding with in the hotel elevator) received the red carpet treatment that the Elysian is apparently noted for. Whatever the reason for our experience, we had a fine stay at the Elysian, but I cannot give it an exceptional review.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Johannesburg, South Africa", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Elysian!\u201d", "Author": "FreqL", "ReviewID": "UR115578432", "Content": "I stayed at the Elysian for 1 night at I was blown away by the quality and service of this hotel.

We actually needed very little in the way of service, but for someone of solidly middle class background, it was always a bit of a kick to be able to look at the nearest person in hotel livery, ask for someone to bring my car around, and hear, \"Right away, Mr (real name).\" I had to give my name or room number less than half of the time. I was routinely offered a bottle of water, the chance to discuss restaurants and attractions, or directions to wherever we were headed. The room was large, well-appointed, and above all, comfortable. I've stayed in many suites with uncomfortable furniture, poor lighting, and thin, rough towels. The Elysian features extremely comfortable furniture, adjustable lighting that could set a mood or illuminate every part of the suite for reading, thick towels, and comfortable robes. My only token complaint was the toilet paper, which is the same stuff every hotel uses. Some day I'm going to find a hotel that decides to afford Charmin. The Water Tower area of downtown Chicago features outstanding dining (Morton's and Le Colonial were within five minutes walk) and is only a few blocks from the lakefront and the Magnificent Mile. The drive to Chinatown and the Field Museum was under fifteen minutes even in traffic, and while the parking at the Elysian was not cheap, it was absolutely hassle-free. I don't like driving around downtown Chicago, but the Elysian's convenient valet parking made it as easy as it could be. The review guidelines suggest I should say what I liked best and least. Best: the staff. If staying at the Elysian was a fair sample of being rich, I want to be rich someday. Having so many people eager to find any way whatsoever to improve my day always made me smile. Least? The TV system features premium channels and DVR capability, but the TV tuner in the bedroom was so well hidden that the remote had trouble controlling it. I consider that a very minor nitpick. Overall, as long as I could afford it, I would stay at the Elysian every time I was in Chicago.

My wife and I were amazed at the quality of service and friendliness that greeted us. This same ambiance continued with the staff at the reception desk and the concierge. We stayed 3 nights at the hotel and were treated as though we were the only guests. The smiles seemed genuine and the concern for our welfare came across heartfelt. I read the reviews of this hotel before we took our trip and I thought that these reveiws must be overstating the experience of the writers. I can tell you that they are not. Below is my review of various aspects of the hotel: Location: Excellent for shopping. The hotel is just two blocks west of Michigan Ave. The only drawback is if you take the rail in from O'Hare, the closest drop off from the Blue Line (the rail that you take from O'Hare) is about 1 1/2 miles away. However, if you are familiar with the rail system, you can take the Blue Line to Jackson and then switch to the Red LIne heading north, and get off at the Chicago stop. The Chicago Transit Authority system is very easy to learn. The hotel is approximately 12 -- 14 minutes, via walking, from Lake Michigan, depending upon the lights. It is approx. 8 -- 10 minutes to Lake Shore Dr. Once to Lake Shore Dr., turn right and walk about 4 minutes to the tunnel at Chicago that takes you under Lake Shore Dr. to the lake. Every day there was a cool breeze that helped to make the jogging/walking very pleasant in July. Rooms: Truly amazing. We were upgraded (without us requesting an upgrade) to a Gold Coast Suite. The suite was very pleasant. It had a fireplace (that was turned off -- I guess for the summer), a balconcy that was very comfortable, two flat screen HD TVs, not including the one in one of the mirrors in the bathroom. The bathroom was 15' x 15' from wall to wall and included a wonderful shower with a tall shower spout for us taller guys. The thermostat was accurate (this is important to me becuase I am normally hot and can never get the temperature cold enough for me to sleep well). The A/C controls had no problem holding the temperature at 66 for our entire stay. Spa/Fitness Center: My wife enjoyed the spa. I really can't say much about that. The fitness center had plenty equipment and room to workout. The hot wet sauna was very good. The hot dry sauna could have been hotter. I say that, but becuase of the temperatures above 100 that we have been experiencing in Texas, the hot sauna felt more like my home town of Dallas and not a hot wet sauna. The swimming pool is indeed one lane. But, don't worry, if you swim after the rush hour time when the members use the facilities, you will be just fine. I went to the Fitness Center around 10 a.m. or around 1:30 p.m. and there were normally 2 or 3 other men using the machines and I was the only person swimming. The lap pool is approx. 60' so it is a little shortter than the standard 25 meter pool. They keep the temperature of the pool at 82 so the water was great! There are plenty of towels around the facility and at the pool. Food: We didn't eat at the hotel; maybe next time. Suggestions: Two extremely minor suggestions: Breath wash in the bathrooms and purchase soap dishes with an elevated base upon which to place the bar of soap. The elevated base should have tiny holes to allow the water to drain from the soap. This will keep the soap from becoming messy underneath. Summary: This hotel received a 5 Start rating. I like to stay at a hotel where I feel comforatble spending the entire day at the hotel. If the Lord allows us to come back to Chicago, we will definitely stay at the Elysian.

The bed was extremely comfortable and the bathroom was perhaps the nicest hotel bathroom I have encountered. I am not a bath tub person and am sometimes disappointed when hotels dedicate significant square footage to a tub and then squeeze in the shower. The shower at the Elysian was huge with great water pressure. Added touches that I appreciated were the spacious bar area with freezer for storing ice, the large, well-lit shower with notched cut-out footrest, and the spacious desk. The entire space\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand there was a lot of space--was just well thought-out. The house car was offered when I asked for a taxi my first afternoon.

The ride was so much more enjoyable, and luxurious, than a taxi ride would have been. Room service and dinner at Balsan were both perfect. The wait staff are friendly, helpful, and approachable, as are all staff members throughout the hotel. The employees seems to like their jobs, like each other and like engaging with guests.

I'm no stranger to luxury hotels, but Elysian is just outstanding in its uniqueness and elegance. The decor in the lobby and the guest rooms definitely have the touch of old time coco chanel but modern at the same time with its cleaniness and simplicity. In the guestroom, there is nothing more you can ask for, comfortable bed, quality toiletry, and even a lint brush. One note, the marble bath tub is among the largest and deepest I have seen in non-suite guest rooms of all high-end hotels. Staff members' friendiness and attention to details are noted everywhere. Once I told them that I had a really early flight next morning, they immediately suggested morning calls and hot coffee service. At 4 in the morning, the coffee they delivered was on-time and delicious. One thing I really appreciated, they anticipated that I was getting ready in the morning, so coffee was delivered by a female staff to avoid possible awkwardness, really impressive!

We are both professionals and work hard running a business, so when we travel, we want to enjoy ourselves in a luxury hotel. We are willing to spend the money for a five star experience, but expect the hotel to deliver. The Elysian has lived up to their reputation. Go ahead and take a chance and try something new, you won't be disappointed. Our room on this visit (Memorial Weekend) was the Gold Coast Premier Suite which feels like a mini-apartment. The balcony is a special treat when staying at a city hotel. The room is incredibly modern, clean and has anything you could want to enjoy your holiday. They have the most comfortable beds too. The staff is accomodating, friendly, and available. Their concierge was well connected and was successful at making a reservation at one of the city's top restaurants for us with little notice and we were not forced to eat at 10pm. Room service needs a little more attention, nothing serious, but, we ordered cappuccino and croissants two mornings and each delivery was missing something pretty basic (cream or sugar). We are frequent Chicago visitors and often stay at the Michigan Avenue location hotels; Peninsula, Ritz-Carlton, and Four Seasons -- you will be just as pleased at The Elysian--Rush Street is right outside the door and only 2 blocks from all the activity of Michigan Avenue. Travelers tip to those who drive--park your car yourself across the street for $15 less per day. The hotel charges $50/per day. It pains me to post this review because the hotel still seems like a well kept secret and I don't want that to change as the word gets out--but travelers need to be as free with the compliments when they are due, as they seem to be with the criticism.

Despite the fantastic things to do in this incredible city (and the weather is wonderful this time of year!) I did not want to leave the hotel. I was treated like a queen from the moment I arrived. Despite my extraordinarily early check-in (arrived at 10 am) I was notified that my room was indeed already ready and that I had also been upgraded to a suite. Amazing. The facilities are gorgeous (the photos speak for themselves.) But what truly makes the Elysian stand out as a cut above is the unparalleled service WITHOUT the pretension or phoniness. I was greeted by name at every turn and given complimentary ammenities for so much as suggesting that I liked something (My glee over the pink envelope that the room key card came in brought the front desk personnel up to my room with an armful of pink stationery for my use!) Not a SINGLE detail was overlooked. The staff helpfully and happily squeezed in a spa appointment despite the last minute request, whereupon I was treated like royalty. A friend who was passing through Chicago whose plane flight happened to be cancelled needed a place to stay for the night. When I notified the staff of the emergency situation they were wonderfully obliging, helpfully suggesting sending someone up to make up the pull out bed and send any toiletries needed since she had no luggage. The staff will make you feel right at home, and the no-tipping policy reinforces that feeling. How wonderful to get such warm and helpful service without feeling like you're having to \"buy it\" from them in constant cash tips.

This hotel just seems to be missing the small details that make a luxury hotel luxury. The hotel desperatley wants to be a luxury hotel, but I find their efforts wanting. I much prefer the understated and confident luxury of other well known luxury hotels in the city-especially those with a longer track record who have proven year after year to be able to meet the expectations of a decerning traveller. There are two elevators servicing all floors, and they are s-l-o-w. I frequently waited upwards of 5-7 minutes per trip, and then had to stop at each floor to which other guests were travelling, making the total commute time from lobby to my room upwards of 10-15 minutes each leg. This adds up, particularly when you add in the unusually slow service at the front desk. And while the bathrooms are nice, there are no towel bars or even a hook on which to hang a towel when coming out of the shower. Details like this should not be overlooked in a hotel that charges this much.

I knew in my heart I had never had a really good one and I had high hopes (really last hopes) for Elysian. Within 10 minutes of our arrival, I donned a luxurious robe and slippers, had a moment to explore an amazing eucalyptus steam room before entering a room to wait for my time. (I returned later) There was a lovely station of nuts and dried fruits in a beautiful tower of spoons with water spiked with orange slices. There were 3 women lounging together after their massages when I arrived in the elegant waiting room. We easily got talking-the Elysian experience does that to you! They have taken trips to spas for 15 years once a year as a girl trip and were amazed at the quality of massage they had just received. Then I got called and what I received in terms of deep tissue massage was nothing short of amazing. After my neck and back, I was thinking incredulously 'there's more!?! Loved the darkened room, quietness, no talking, sensitivity to my thoughts on pressure. wonderful heated towels covering my body in comfort. I received a massage I have only dreamed about in 25 years. Could barely walk out of the room but my massage therapist met me with a beautiful glass of water with orange. I fell into a beautiful chair with fruit and nuts in my lap and felt like a queen with not a care in the world. This kind of massage has stayed with me and I feel like it has provided healing to my soul.", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lenox, MA", "Title": "\u201cExquisite urban hotel, beautiful room, excellent location\u201d", "Author": "AliMurr", "ReviewID": "UR99931039", "Content": "We came here for my husband's birthday for an extended weekend.

We stayed at a Gold Coast Suite for $500 a night which included brunch/breakfast every morning for two at their really nice restaurant and a bottle of champagne delivered to the room. Truthfully, we could have been fine with just a room vs. a suite, there was only the two of us and we never used the living room or the balcony. (I think the price for that with the same package would have been in 300s). Having learned it's my husband's birthday, they sent us a complementary chocolate birthday cake to the room. We ate at Balsan, which has the best, most creative and delicious brunch cocktail list ever. It turns into a trendy cool (but not noisy or crowded) bistro/bar at night, their bar selections and creations are superb and they make EVERYTHING in house, like jams, nutella, drink mixes, as well as serve great cured meat and crudo plates which they will cut and arrange right behind the bar which is a show in itself.

I guess i would like to start by saying ive stayed at every fine hotel Chicago has to offer, if you are an ambassador, maybe stay at Sofitel, they have amazing security. But if you are a traveler that wants a 5 star experience, or a local looking to get away from home for a few days, The Elysian redefines that option. They make me feel at home without even trying. I stayed at the Elysian last november on what happened to be the day after their Year anniversary. Just to get away and do some early christmas shopping . The experience was so enjoyable that i decided to book a couple days for my birthday recently knowing that id be able to relax and unwind. I was sent up extra bath amenities to my room which provided me with the best soak i have ever taken. I also had an amazing chocolate truffle cake waiting for me when i arrived. By the time i had to leave i was ready to book another weekend, or move in, definately move in, if i could afford it at least. I have stayed at a couple 5 star hotels in NYC, San Francisco, Denver, Miami and the only other establishment i can recommend as highly as The Elysian, Is The Grove Park Inn of Asheville North Carolina, because of their Spa. Its worth going to just because of their spa. While i havent tried the Spa at the Elysian yet. The Elysian hotel is almost a reason to come to Chicago. Once you stay at the Elysian you will be happy to have business in Chicago. its that good, i kid you not. Everything positive review you have read is true. Everything about the Elysian exceeds my expectations, especially if you get a room with a fireplace. The only issue i experienced was an in room dining meal i dont really feel was a great value. \"The Steak\" The deserts i had were amazing, i just felt my entree could have been better. it was delicious and tasty but i just expected more for the price. There is amazing food within the hotel, although i have not been able to try the 2 michelin starred restaurant yet. i look forward to dining there. i will make sure i take advantage of the actual restaurants next time instead of ordering mains for room service. i just felt lazy that night. plus i was alone and dining out alones gets old sometimes. But Chicago has the best restaurants in the country, so your not here for room service, right. There is no question about it, stay at the Elysian. Its intimate and low-key, but opulent and luxurious at the same time. the Staff and service are incredible and the no tipping policy is something that makes me feel really safe. i feel like they care about me, not the tip i have for them, i am sure they do.

The second day we ordered the same thing and that time we were missing the butter and jelly for the bagels. So, the room service could use some improvement.

Breakfast was fantastic and prices were high, but reasonable. The staff was polite and very helpful. I enjoyed this hotel much more than the Four Seasons in Chicago. My only gripe was that the pillows were a little hard on the bed. The bathrooms, particularly the shower and bathtub were awesome. Internet was free, and the bellman would not accept a tip per hotel policy.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel EVER\u201d", "Author": "BringAHeater", "ReviewID": "UR96157041", "Content": "My fiance surprised me with a night away from reality for our anniversary in January.

The car was great as well, a new Lexus LS460 to drive you around a two mile radius in Chicago. Fantastic! The room was great as well. You felt as if it was your private residence. The rooms are done up in black and white and grey with some color in the pictures if this turns you off then maybe this hotel is not for you. Everything was new and sparkling clean with Italian cotton sheets on the bed. The bed was extremely cozy and comfortable. The only problem we encountered was a slight natural gas smell when the fireplace was turned on. Management says they are working on it. Parking is $50.00 per night but it is worth it considering everything else that they hotel offers complimentary. If you are going to Chicago stay here you will not be disappointed. The area where the hotel is located is the nicest area in downtown and the best shops and restaurants are all within walking distance. 900 N Michigan Ave where Bloomingdales is located is right next door, and Water Tower Place is just across Michigan Ave. We will only stay here in Chicago.

Our room, although 16 stories up could hear a fire engine roaring at 3:30 AM, but to some degree, that's what happens when you stay in a large city. The bad: when I booked, it appeared that my room was a smaller suite with breakfast and a $25 credit included. However, when I went to the confirmation page, the breakfast and credit were nowhere to be found. In the \"special inquiries\" or the equivalent area, I asked for confirmation that same was included. Of course, when I went to check out, they said it was not. For 5 minutes, it was clear I was not going to get any relief, but this was $75, so I was not simply going to go away, especially since I felt I was right, and they never responded to my request. Finally, the woman gave me a $50 credit. While that was nice, I believe the website was unclear, and the fact I attempted to make it clear should not require me to haggle for a final bill in a hotel such as this one.

The hotel is just beautiful...lovely courtyard/driveway, sparkling lobby, dark and cozy bar, gorgeous guest rooms with fireplaces. I prepaid online $195 for a deluxe King room (600+ square feet), and we were offered an upgrade to an 1100 sq ft 1-bedroom suite with an extra half bath and balcony for an additional $55 per night. I had to pinch myself when I saw the suite we paid only $240 a night for. Peaks at the lake, balcony, tasteful and comfortable furnishings, soothing palette of taupes, grays, black, white and cream, working fireplace and gorgeous carrara marble bathroom with awesome soaking tub and Asprey bath products, a quite impressive B&W sound system, and some of the most beautiful linens I have seen anywhere. Service was attentive and friendly. When we checked in, we asked if my husband's black driving moccasins with white top stitching could be polished. After half a winter in the mid-west, they looked like they had had a salt bath. (I had taken them to a local shoe repair place where we live, and they just couldn't do it without turning all the stitching black and \"it would take at least 2 days to get the salt out\"). Elysian returned his shoes within hours, looking almost brand new, top-stitching still white, and NO CHARGE. I kid you not! We stopped by Bernard's, the hotel bar, for cocktails before a late dinner reservation, and it's a total departure from the rest of the hotel: very dimly lit; cozy and masculine. Exactly how a bar should be...I felt like I was in the men's bar of a country club that had been there forever. The bartender was very busy whipping up some pretty elaborate cocktails for diners in one of the restaurants, but he still made time to chat with us. Very pleasant, friendly guy. They serve wonderful homemade potato chips and mixed nuts too. We didn't visit the spa or exercise area but we saw the spa lobby....also lovely. We also didn't visit the restaurants. The only thing that fell just a bit short was in-room dining. The menu in the room has a limited dinner selection, but when we called we were told that we could order anything from Balsan's menu which we had to look up online. I'm sure they would have brought one to the room if we had asked, but it would have been nice if one was already there. Maybe it changes too often to put in each room. My starving husband ordered Pasta Bolognese and for $20, he received about 1 1/2 cups of penne with sauce. He complained, ordered a burger (awesome), and the hotel took the pasta off the tab. I had the chicken club which was also great. They sent a bread basket up that had some of the best bread I've had, ah divine! I only have two very minor suggestions based on our stay: (1) I would increase the portion size or take the pasta off the menu; I've since seen other reviews that mention this. (2) I would have bath salts by the tub when guests arrive. (I asked for more conditioner and they brought salts as well.) Our check-out experience was terrible...only because we had to leave. My husband and I live about 3 hours from Chicago and visit often. We've stayed in most of the hotels in the Gold Coast. Not one of them even comes close to the Elysian.

Our suite was very nice with a northerly view up Rush Street. The bed was very comfortable and the bath large and inviting. Closet space was generous and the in-room wet bar a nice amenity. Though it was cold outside, I enjoyed stepping out onto the balcony for a breath of fresh air in the mornings. Turndown service came on our first night - but then not again. The second of the minor oversights. We dined at Balsan on the first night of our stay and it was really very good. Make sure you order the tarte flambe - rich, crispy and delicious! We returned from the Chicago Boat Show on our second night of the stay and wanted to share a bottle of bubbly in the room before going to dinner at Girl and the Goat (thanks Peter, Chef Concierge!) but Housekeeping had failed to re-stock our room with glassware. There was not a glass to be found, so we had to call for delivery. The third of the minor oversights and one that would be repeated the following day, too.

The coffee was hot and strong, which I enjoyed. And for $18 per entree, I would have thought toast would be included. Nope - it's offered as a side for $4.

Its location is an easy walk to busy Michigan ave and after a busy day of shopping is a great retreat to come back to. Our room was very spacious and beautifully decorated. We had an excellent nights sleep as there were no street sounds-and in Chicago this can be a problem. Additionally, you do not hear any sounds coming from the adjacent hotel rooms-also a problem in Chicago. The real fireplace in our room was appreciated after a cold day.

My husband and I recently spent one night here and I would happily return. We stayed in a Classic King room which was very spacious and tastefully appointed. The bathroom has a nice soaking tub plus a stand-alone shower and plenty of vanity space, complete with TVs built into the mirrors--very cool. Our room had a small wet bar including a microwave and spacious freezer/refrigerator--bigger than most you find in hotels. The room itself was really nice--again, very spacious and had a desk, flat screen TV, sitting area with a comfy chair and a large closet with drawers. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we were treated to yummy cookies from the turn-down service when we returned from our night out. We took advantage of the bar, one of the restaurants and the health club during our stay. I was slightly disappointed in the health club. The amount of equipment is more than sufficient with five treadmills, three ellipticals, bikes, plus weight machines, free weights, etc.--but it felt crammed. There wasn't really any open floor space for stretching. Also, don't mistake this for a hotel gym that guests don't use. When we got there early on a Sunday morning all five of the treadmills plus one of the ellipticals were already being used. We had an after-dinner cocktail at Bernard's (the bar) and found the service to be a bit slow and the prices to be a bit high, but it was convenient to not have to leave the hotel given the cold, rainy weather. And in their defense, the bar was packed. It's got a warm, cozy vibe going on but it felt a lot like a typical hotel bar to me--nothing special. We brunched at Balsan and found the prices to be a bit much, again, for what it was. The food was very good--I had poached eggs with prosciutto on grilled sourdough and it was really rich, delicious and satisfying--but that said we still found the bill to be a bit excessive for brunch, especially when it didn't involve mimosas or bloody marys! The service was great. We didn't have any special requests while we were there nor did we need to leverage the concierge, but all of the staff seemed very helpful, attentive and eager to please.

The hotel is located on East Walton, and is quite close to Oak Street, the Magnificent Mile, and State Street. It's also located a short distance from the highway, so it's a fairly simple process to get in and out if you're driving. We actually chose Elysian because we were shopping for a bed and Elysian is a partner hotel for Chicago Luxury Beds, offering a few rooms with VI-Spring beds, so you can try out the bed for a night or two before making a purchase. While we didn't fall in love with the bed (it was slightly too firm for us and we ended up going with a Hastens instead; FYI, most of the Elysian rooms have regular mattresses), we absolutely adored the hotel. Elysian is the place you dream about when you wish for a hotel where the top priority is impeccable service. The staff take wonderful care of you to the point where you don't even have to move the revolving door yourself. And they won't accept tips, either, something that's slightly awkward when you initially try handing some cash to your bellman, only to be refused. From the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out, my husband and I experienced warmth and friendliness from the hotel staff. They made sure that our every need was accommodated with a smile- a REAL smile. Staff members introduced themselves and each other by name and regularly engaged us in pleasant conversation. And after recommending a restaurant to us for dinner the night before, the concierge remembered us and asked how we enjoyed our dining experience. As for the hotel itself, it's gorgeous and stunningly appointed. We stayed in a King room and it was the largest room I've ever had in Chicago. The room had a fireplace, LCD TV, and a TV that was actually embedded within the bathroom mirror. Everything was impeccably clean and we wanted for nothing. They had robes and slippers for us (one small pair of slippers for me, a larger pair for my hubby), and bottles of Evian were delivered with the turndown service. Elysian has BMWs with drivers that will take you anywhere in the city within a 2-mile radius. Our driver took us to Gino's for my husband's first Chicago pizza, and when we discovered a line outside the building, he quickly changed course and took us to a second Gino's location, where we had no wait at all. I have to confess that I wish we'd ordered in-room dining more than once. My husband and I enjoyed an in-room breakfast that was impeccably prepared and absolutely delicious. We'll have to try the dinner menu (and make restaurant reservations!) during our next stay. I have absolutely no hesitation about recommending Elysian to anyone and everyone I know. In fact, even after only a mere two nights there, I feel like somewhat of an ambassador for Elysian. More often than not, my husband and I stay in Marriott-owned properties when traveling around the world, because I inherited some timeshare weeks that yield a useful amount of reward points. But Marriott lacks customer service, and I've always imagined that there must be hotels out there where the staff cares about their work and provides an exceptional level of service. And Elysian delivers the kind of service I've always dreamt of- solicitous and helpful without being overbearing or false. You really get the sense that the staff really cares about their work and wants to do the best job possible. In short, Elysian takes the word \"hotel\" to a completely different level- it's more of a home away from home, but the home you wish you owned in downtown Chicago, where the people know you and make you feel totally welcome.

When traveling, we never can get anything but oatmeal from room service for breakfast. So. . . .since they asked, we asked if they could come up with some options. . . maybe some vegan pancakes.

Would have been nice to soak with the wife. . . . .but we soaked alone in the spa! Then spent some time in the sauna and steam-rooms. The staff was great. Any request was handled very quickly.

Based on their recommendations, it was with some trepidation that we made our reservations for the Elysian, forsaking the incredible Peninsula Hotel. We were upgraded upon registration to a Suite with a fireplace and a tiny balcony (but a balcony, nevertheless!). The staff was outstanding, from the building engineer repairing the fireplace that wouldn't light, to the housekeeper that came by to check to see if everything in the room was fine. When my wife asked for a coffee maker and some decaf coffee, the pot, coffee,and fresh cream were delivered in a matter of a few minutes. We were impressed by the rapid responsiveness of all of the personnel. The individual treatment surpassed the incredible service at the Peninsula, which is hard to do. I was personally escorted to the ATM machine in the business center when I asked for one. I was not about to just be directed there. The Elysian also has a \"no tipping\" policy, with the staff politely saying \"my pleasure\" when offered a tip, and holding their hand to their chest. They mean it when they say no tipping. In addition, the staff seemed less formal but equally professional as compared to the Peninsula. I preferred this attitude, although I am not complaining about the Peninsula staff. My wife said they just seemed more \"enthusiastic\", whatever that means, but I understood. I commented that it was absolutely quiet, even though we were on a lower floor (12th). The room was very spacious, well laid out and the bed was exactly what I prefer. The bathroom had a gigantic shower, with a nifty little niche in the wall where you could place your foot so that your leg was at the perfect angle for washing. Amazing attention to detail! My wife did comment that the absence of hooks for towels and washcloths near the shower was a mild annoyance. My only complaint was the alarm clock was a elegant old style battery driven clock which could not be seen with the lights off, and no way to see it without turning on a room light. Each floor of the hotel seems to only have 8 rooms, so it is very quiet. In addition, getting in and out of the hotel and on your way takes about 1 minute, as opposed to the circuitous route to leave the Peninsula, as elegant and interesting as it is. We didn't sample the restaurants, but we were informed that Via, the main restaurant, just received two Michelin stars in November, not too shabby! My wife used the Fitness Center and commented that it was the nicest she had ever used. It has a lap pool, sauna, and the latest equipment. The high speed internet was free (it really irritates me when a luxury hotel charges for internet when the Days Inn across the street gives it to you free) and very easy to log on to.

My fianc\u00c3\u00a9 proposed on Friday morning and surprised me with a trip to Chicago to celebrate. He chose the Elysian based on the excellent online reviews, and we were not disappointed. From the moment we arrived, the service was impeccable. Everybody who works at the Elysian is so friendly and warm, which is sadly often not the case at other upscale hotels. During our stay, we did not come across one staff member who provided anything less than excellent service. Upon checking in, Nicolette, the Guest Services Manager, asked whether we were celebrating a special occasion, and we mentioned our recent engagement. When we returned to our room later that evening, there was a chilled bottle of champagne and delicious macaroons waiting for us, which was such a classy and nice gesture. One night, our carbon monoxide detector went off because the batteries were low, and when we called the front desk, they had someone at our room in under a minute, I kid you not. They were also profusely apologetic for the inconvenience. When we were leaving to go to the airport, we mentioned that we were going to take the El to O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare, and before we knew it, somebody at the front desk had called one of the house BMWs to whisk us to the Chicago blue line stop. We also signed up for the deal where we got free breakfast each day (room service counts), which was incredible. These are just a few examples of the little touches that occurred throughout the weekend and made what would have been a great trip an incredible one. I would be remiss if I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t mention how gorgeous this hotel is.

Honestly, I am not kidding when I say this was the most amazing hotel either my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 or I have ever been to. We are even looking into having our wedding there. Even though it is by no means inexpensive, we both feel that we got a great deal given the level of service, the amazing environment, the location, and the free breakfasts.

It is, quite simply, among the elite hotels not only in Chicago but in the world. My wife, myself and our three boys (8, 5 and 3) stayed 4 nights in a deluxe suite while I was in Chicago on business. We arrived at the hotel at 1:30 a.m. and were promptly met and assisted by no less than 4 members of the incredible staff. Within 5 minutes we were checked in and in the suite with the sofa bed already made up, a roll-away set up, a handwritten welcome note from the general manager and stuffed monkeys on the beds for the kids. There was also a bottle of Evian next to each of our beds (including the kids) which was a very nice touch. The suite was exquisite. The color scheme is dark gray and white and is very elegant but exceedingly comfortable. The suite was about 1200 sq. ft. with a living room with working fire place, sofa bed, desk and small dining table and wet bar. There is also a 42\" tv over the fireplace. There was also a balcony off the living room. There was a powder room off the hall and then master bedroom. The master bedroom has two very large closets, a set off drawers, and very comfortable bed and a chair. There is a 42\" plasma tv on the wall and plenty of space for luggage and storage. There is also an ipod docking station on the dresser. The master bathroom is huge. Separate tub and walk-in shower (the shower is huge), separate toilet room and a dual vanity sink with an LCD TV built into the mirror. There were plenty of towels and the generous sized Asprey amenities were great. The room was very quite and one could control all the lights from various panels as well as request privacy and that the room could be made up. There was also a large closet at the entry. Our view was o.k.--not great--but from the living room one could look straight towards the Hancock Tower. The furniture was also substantial and very comfortable. The room had free Wi-Fi which was had both a strong signal and fast (unlike many hotels) and did not require logging in each time. Everything worked and it was truly spotless. Dirt, dust and fingerprints were simply not tolerated as every day when we returned to the room it was spotless. While the rooms are incredible, it is really the service that sets the Elysian apart from its competitors. Having had the privilege to have stayed at various Four Seasons, Ritz-Carltons, Mandarins and Peninsulas, I found the service at the Elysian to be the most genuine service anywhere. The staff strike a perfect balance between being helpful but not intrusive. The service is not obsequious like it is in some Far Eastern Hotels nor formulaic as you sometimes get in the bigger chains. Every single interaction we had with members of the staff--whether it was check-in, check-out, room-service, the spa, the concierge or getting a taxi was memorable for one reason or another. The no-tipping policy is real--every time a tip was offered it was politely but firmly refused. (The only exception was in the restaurants and in-room dining where an 18% tip was automatically added. While some reviewers did not like this practice, we thought it was great and, based on our experience, totally warranted since the service was always excellent.) The staff were wonderful with the kids and really went the extra effort to make them feel welcomes--whether it was the stuffed monkeys on the bed, crayons and cards to color in the restaurant or simply holding the door and letting them enter while mom and dad still scrambled to get out of the taxi they really treated them as guests in their own right--to me this says something about how the hotel values all of their guests no matter how old or, in this case, young. I could go on and on about this hotel. Suffice it to stay, we have found our new hotel in Chicago and recommend it to everyone. While the hotel is not inexpensive, it is a great value.

The location is pretty good, within walking distance to Navy Pier, a number of fine restaurants, good night life (check out the underground Wonder Bar directly across the street), and also very close to the hancock center/shopping area. But back to the Hotel experience itself. I am not sure how to even express in words how incredible the experience was. So, i'll just list out the positives: - Impeccably clean. not even a drop of dust anywhere. The floors in the rooms had obviously just been vacuumed. not even a fingerprint on any of the glass tables -Tremendous Service. the entire staff was genuinely friendly and helpful, but without being pushy or making anything seem routine. - Free internet. THANK YOU! There is no reason for 5 star hotels to charge for internet access. - Free Bottled water at check in/out - After a long day on planes and in airports, that was actually just what i needed - Terraces in every room. With the recent warm weather in Chicago, it was so nice to sit on the terrace and have a few drinks and then in the morning, have breakfast outside - Spacious bathrooms, with plenty of space for tall people like me - Ipod/iphone dock with speaker. I plugged in, tuned in to the free internet, and i had sirius radio playing while sitting on the terrace - Private Bar. note that this was a wet bar, not just a fridge with little bottles in it. Stocked with great liquor, interesting non-alc beverages, and tasty snacks. - Quick room service - i ordered a pizza for a mid day snack after check in, and breakfast the next day. Neither meal took longer than 25 minutes to arrive. They even brought up a large carafe of purified water with the pizza (didnt even ask for it) I could honestly go on for pages on the positives. Lierally at every turn, every minute, there was another positive Cons...cons? okay, there has to be some right? These are completely nit-picking, but i guess the Elysian would want to know so they can inch ever closer to unattainable perfection - Breakfast size - delicious, but small. maybe i just ordered the smallest option, but i was left a bit hungry after the meal. - OJ - there was no orange juice in the private bar. would've like to have some as its tough to make screwdrivers without OJ - Doorbell - Yes, the room had a doorbell, but it could barely be heard once inside the suite. maybe have a way to turn the volume up/down on it - service - absolutely not a thing...don't change anything about the service.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "duluth mn", "Title": "\u201cThis Hotel is a 10\u201d", "Author": "duluthian", "ReviewID": "UR83188819", "Content": "Yes- believe the accolades written here about the Elysian.

The staff are very friendly, the hotel is beautifully appointed and the location can not be beat. We stayed in a deluxe suite and it felt like a home away from home. We had a separate living/dining room that had a fireplace , wet bar (which included the ice maker which we used quite often as Chicago experienced record breaking weather over our stay (October 8-11th) with one day reaching close to 90 degrees!), and a nice large desk that you could use to plan out your stay. Down the hall way there was a separate powder room. You then had a separate sleeping area that could be closed off to ensure privacy if you were having guests over or if you felt like adding an additional layer of quietness - although the rooms were very quiet so this is not necessary. In your sleeping quarters you had a lovely dressing area with two separate closets and a bank of drawers in between. You have a lovely large bathroom with a separate shower and soaker tub and a separate wc. The bedroom area has a nice king sized bed and two night tables and another chest of drawers. You really could live in this suite there is plenty of storage for all of your things. The suite comes with three televisions: one in the living room, one in the bedroom and one in the bathroom mirror. It is the perfect place to retreat to after a long day of sight seeing, shopping, dining and walking. In case you forgot a lint brush and shoe horn they are also provided in the room as well as standards such as robes and slippers. One of my favourite things about the room was the balcony off of the living/dining room. My husband and I live in a condo in a busy city and we do not have a balcony so this was a real treat for us. We had drinks on the balcony each night and listened to the city go by. Finally in terms of location you can find some great things within minutes of the hotel. For those of you who like Starbucks - there are two within a few minutes walk of the hotel - one on Rush Street and one at the corner of Delaware and N. State street (one street south of the hotel). There is a Sprinkles cupcake store a few minutes away on Walton Street as well (50 East Walton). An Einstein bagel just past the Sprinkles store on your way to Michigan ave (for the days you want something quick, easy and inexpensive) and as others have mentioned a Walgreens across the street from the hotel which is great if you have forgotten anything at home. Also close by is Pizano's Pizza a great place to get deep dish Chicago style pizza (it takes 30 minutes to make but it is well worth it). It is at 864 N. State Street, just south of Delaware. For shopping East Walton Street is one block south of the Oak Street which is like 5th Avenue in NYC or Rodeo Drive in LA. Michigan Ave is a 5 minute walk away from the hotel and you will find malls, independent boutiques and chains with the \"Magnificent Mile\".

Very cool feature was the electronic lightswitches such that from one button you can turn all the lights on or off with a single touch. The hotel is new, and everything felt new and most upto date. Great wifi access with no hassles or annoying surcharges. The staff was over the top with helpfulness. At the front desk, at the front door and housekeeping, everyone was proactively helpful and energetic. One example is we walked out the front door into their courtyard, looking for a taxi to Union Station and one of the staff immediately offered to whisk us there in the hotel limo. That was nice for us, but it also really showed initiative, care and energy for the driver to know he had a free block in his schedule and to happily offer, rather than hide in the background out of fear or apathy. On the drive, we chatted a bit and he said that everyone working there is thrilled to be creating a new hotel. I think it shows. The location was ideal. Just near the 'Water Tower' at the pinacle of the 'Magnificent Mile.' It makes a nice walk down Michigan Ave to the river area (thumbs up for the architectural boat tour).

The tub was a true oasis, one that my hubby wishes I hadn't seen because now I am dropping hints about a possible bathroom remodel!!! Timo was a great help and directed us to a very nice place to eat near the Second City theater. A car is availeable to use within a two mile radius, but it is on a first come first serve basis. Unfortunatley it was never available during our stay. I did see a Peddycab with the hotel name on it, but am not sure if this was something offered through the hotel or just advertising. The staff was always very willing to help in any way that the could. We did have to call for glasses to be brought up though because they were not replenished when the room was cleaned. One block from Water Tower shops, so the proximaty to shopping GREAT without being right on top of it. Everything is close enough so that the highest cab air we paid was less than $10.00. That was to Wacker St. and Mihigan Ave.. There is a microwave and refrigerator in the room to keep some suplies on hand. Also there is a freezer with ice that was a savior to my husband during the unusually hot weekend. There is a Walgreens across the street for any needs. I would suggest this hotel to anyone wanting a nice weekend away and to feel pampered. The no tipping thing was awkward for us. I felt guilty and wondered if I really shouldn't tip or if this was just what was said and the staff really did expect tips. I suppose this would work out fine or those visiting from Europe and not used to our way of tipping, but I felt cheap not handing over a tip.

We chose to stay at the Elysian based on a recommendation from a friend. Overall, we had a wonderful stay and would definitely return. Pros -Rooms- they are BEAUTIFUL and new! Each room has a fireplace which the staff happily turned on for us in the middle of July. The bathrooms are huge, beautiful and clean. The soaking tub is so great! The layout of the bedroom and sitting area is wonderful and cozy. The entryway provides lots of storage and wetbar, plus is a barrier from noise. - Lobby and Entryway- Beautiful and secluded from the main street. - Location- perfect for Michigan Avenue shopping, walking to State Street restaurants, or heading to any number of hip hotels. - Value- reasonable rate for a beautiful hotel. Cons - Inexperienced Staff- 1) when making the reservation, the reservationist told me to ask for an upgrade at desk due to our affiliation and low occupancy rate for that weekend. The man at the reception desk told me that they could not accomodate an upgrade but they gave me a room with fireplace. I pointed out to him that \"all rooms have a fireplace. don't they?!\" That type of attitude is just not acceptable to me from those in the hospitality industry! 2) when we made the reservation, I also ordered a cheese plate (no meat) and bottle of champagne to be sent to room at check-in. The plate arrived with 2 pieces of cheese and 2 pieces of salami and no bread,crackers other. We obviously had to send it back. and 3) we called down to concierge to see if they could recommend a restaurant and indicated that we live in the city so looking for somewhere new, trendy to try. The concierge started recommending places equivalent to the cheesecake factory and not even in the close downtown area. I asked him if he was just looking on OpenTable and he said yes. I chalk experiences 2 and 3 up to a new hotel and staff, and hopefully that will be rectified soon. - Pool- very small. - Bar/ Lounge- was not open during the day and there is no outside terrace like Peninsula, Conrad and many others. Overall, the stay was great b/c the rooms are so luxurious and you feel pampered. The location is perfect and the rate reasonable. The hotel is new so it seems they were still working out some kinks.

From the beginning of our stay, and straight to the end, the service was very attentive and graceful. The property itself is very beautiful with its contemporary take on art deco style. Our suite was on the ninth floor, had a separate living room and bedroom, a large foyer with a kitchenette (with microwave), two large closets, and a fabulous marble bathroom. The decor was all in soft tones of grey, the only hits of colour being in the art on the walls. All of the furniture and materials were fresh, luxurious, and comfortable, and the suite was kept meticulously clean. The bathroom had some very stylish features such as the marble mosaic, frosted glass-walled shower and lavatory, and the mirror with a concealed plasma screen. The Asprey amenities were also a stylishly luxe touch. The only downside of the suite was the view. We did call ahead and asked for a room with a panoramic view, but as we were on a lower floor, the only view we had was of the \"900 North Michigan Self-Park\". Though this was offset by the fact that the suite felt like a luxurious cocoon. Other than that, the suite was amazing with the working gas fireplace in the living room and the desk in the window alcove. The food at the Elysian was also surprisingly good and far above average hotel quality. On our first night at the hotel we dined at Balsan on the third floor. The food was classic bistro (roast chicken for two- perfect!), with discreet service, elegant ambiance, and was surprisingly affordable. We also ordered from in-room dining several times, as the food was very good quality (including beautifully presented charcuterie and cheese), the service was prompt, and again, it was more affordable than most five-star hotels. The spa and fitness centre at the Elysian were also stunning. Though the lap pool was narrow, it was quite large and was new and clean. The design was light, bright, and airy and was a refreshing respite from the unusually hot and humid May weather. In other reviews, there have been complaints about the Elysian's location. We actually found the location to be quite decent, and wished we had had time to wander around the surrounding area. The area was far quieter than right on North Michigan Avenue. Though there is a deteriorated half-block of brownstones across the street most of the surrounding area was decent at worst. There were several upscale shops in and within a couple block's radius of the hotel. After all, Marc Jacobs has a boutique on the ground floor of the hotel, Diesel is on the opposite corner, and Tory Burch is a block away. The Elysian also has a no-tipping policy in place, therefore we were not required to tip the staff, though an eighteen percent service charge is added to all food orders. Other reviewers on this sight have deemed this service charge outrageous, but generally you would tip the same amount anyway and the service was worth it. All staff, including those at reception and the concierge were friendly and immensely helpful, and gave many good recommendations. The weekend we stayed there was also the Chicago restaurant convention. The Elysian was at nearly ninety percent capacity, and they did not miss a beat. We travel extensively, and the Elysian Chicago really is a special experience. I loved the Elysian and I would rot hesitate to return.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Charleston, South Carolina", "Title": "\u201cPhenomenal Service!\u201d", "Author": "rtpaige03", "ReviewID": "UR62486527", "Content": "From the moment we arrived at the Elysian for a girls' weekend, we were treated like royalty.

I do a great deal of event planning with hotels in my job and wanted to stay away from any hotel that made me feel like I was working. I wanted a smaller, boutique-type hotel. I had heard of the Elysian when it was featured on the 190 North TV program and that it had been the site for Jennifer Hudson's Christmas special, so I decided to check it out. It's just beautiful! A mix of contemporary artfulness and classic elegance. The courtyard makes you feel like your pulling up to a small European chateau and the lobby is gorgeous with beautful light fixtures and cool art. The service was superbe, with a courteous and attentive staff greeting you as if you were royalty. I booked a king size room based on an internet special of $345 per night; and for a stay of more than one night, the hotel provided a $100 credit! So we stayed two nights. Prior to our arrival, the hotel called to ask if there was anything special we needed for our stay. I explained we were to be married. They automatically upgraded us to a suite and provided a complimentary plate of first quality charcuterie and cheese as a welcome. The suite had a gas fireplace, two flatscreen TVs, a spacious carrera marble bathroom with a huge shower and soaking tub, lush bathrobes and plenty of closet and drawer space. The best part was the amazing B&W ipod station that is one of the best sound systems I ever heard. Thankfully the rooms were soundproof because we used the ipod station to its (almost) full capacity. The service was impeccable. When the pilot light when out in the fireplace, an engineer was up within a few minutes of the call to fix it. The maid did not take the tip we left the first night. I had read on Trip Advisor that the Elysian has a no-tip policy (beyond gratuities already included), but nothing was said to us about that. We enjoyed a drink at the bar, Bernard. My husband inquired about the ginger beer he enjoyed in the room but was not on the bar menu. The server without skipping a beat got him the beer. Nice touch! The health club is immaculate and has a separate, full pilates workout room! I've never seen that in a hotel before. The Elysian is perfectly located within short walking distances from some of the best restaurants and nightlife in Chicago. With the exception of an evening of live jazz music two blocks away at The Backroom and dinner across the street at the fabulous Le Colonial, we barely left our room. It was the perfect choice for our mini-honeymoon.

If I ever moved to Chicago, I would want to live in this building. It is grand in its finishes, amenities and service. We expected luxury when we made our reservations, but luxury, service and comfort do not always coincide to such high levels. Every aspect of the hotel was meticulously maintained. The other positive reviews on this website are accurate to date, as are the photos on the hotel's website. Our wonderful experience far outweighs any minor weakness that we encountered (yes, they need cotton swabs and shower caps in the bathroom). The soundproofing in our standard king room on the nineteenth floor provided protection from city and guest noises like we were sleeping in our own bedroom. If you have never slept in a bed with perfectly pressed linens, you are in for a real treat. The free wireless internet access was lightning fast and allowed me to work easily from anywhere in our room. The food and service at both restaurants was the best we experienced during our five-night stay. When the chef learned that we did not eat pork sausage, he ordered chicken sausage for our next breakfast. Mark was the most helpful and proactive concierge that we have ever encountered. He left nothing to chance and followed up on every detail. We visited the spa three times during our stay and each had a 60-minute massage. The spa areas, exercise room and lap pool were open to hotel guests for use without reservation. My wife is a swimmer and enjoyed swimming in the warm salt water of the elegantly tiled lap pool. The staff of the Elysian routinely greeted us by name as if we were residents. The location of the hotel is next to Bloomingdale's and the Four Seasons/Ritz Carlton; and two blocks from the Hancock Tower and Water Tower Place mall on Michigan Avenue. Even in the 20-degree weather, we enjoyed the short walks to shopping. The circular vehicle entry courtyard is unique and works well with its doorman and bell staff who jumped to offer assistance each time we arrived. When we requested help with our boarding passes for our return flight, the staff printed and delivered them to our room in about 10 minutes. The phones had one button for any service need. Whoever answered, helped with any request. We were never placed on hold or asked to wait.
