{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Rural idyll on the outskirts of Florence On arriving at I Parigi we were warmly welcomed and helped with useful information. Tickets for the Uffizi were booked for us, we were sold a pack of bus tickets to get us in and out of Florence on the frequent buses from the bottom of the lane.We were given good recommendations for restaurants within walking distance (la Bianchina has good food and is really friendly) . The setting is beautiful and the views of rural Tuscany wonderful after a day spent looking at frescos and climbing towers. The rooms are clean and comfortable including a kettle and sachets of tea and coffee. There is a common room with internet access and lots of info on Tuscany. The breakfast loggia in the garden is very pleasant, and the breakfast excellent.  We found that it took us 10 minutes to walk down the hill and 15 minutes back up, We had a torch so that drivers could see us. In a car the best thing if arriving from the autostrada is to drive past, turn just down the road near the entrance to the monastery and come back to the lane.The gardens are lovely and we relaxed by the swimming pool, but, at the end of September, only stayed in the water for a short time.", "Date": "Sep 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR748587810", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Margaret_&_Andrew"}, {"Content": "Fabulous Little Gem!!!! We stayed at I Parigi from Thurs 26th June to Mon 30th June, it was absoloutely amazing! Gorgeous surroundings, views were magical!

I highly recommend I Parigi for anyone who is visiting Florence and the surrounding countryside and wants to fit a little down time into the schedule. A 5-10 minute drive from the Porta Romana of Florence, I Parigi is a refuge from the noise and crowds of the city. Set on a hill, it provides a fabulous view of olive trees, cypresses, and the types of buildings you go to Tuscany to see. Like another reviewer said, you arrive wondering if it can live up to the photos, and it does that and more.The proprietors are friendly and helpful (but not the warm, fuzzy type -- if you want to be welcomed into someone's home and treated like family, this is not the place for you.) Unlike most of the places in a similar price range, they have a pool (!) and offer internet access for 3 euros an hour. Our only problem was finding the place. We were misled by a small road sign that we thought indicated we should turn at a place where we shouldn't have turned. According to one of the proprieters, that sign says 1 km at the bottom, but that part must have been overgrown with roadside brush. :-) Anyway, about 40 minutes of circling through small communities and a couple phone calls to I Parigi, we finally arrived and were very glad we had. If I returned here, I would make sure I had more time to stay on the grounds and enjoy!", "Date": "Sep 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR692776546", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MadNil"}, {"Content": "A charming little gem Thank you Marco and staff at I Parigi for a wonderful stay! Although tricky to find - it is well worth the extra few minutes of driving . We spent a week at the hotel - it wasn't our intention to stay in Florence so long, however we loved the hotel so decided to keep it as a base to tour the back roads of Tuscany as well as relax after several frenetic days in Florence. The rooms are immaculate and the setting is beautiful. It was nice to come home to the quiet gardens and the smell of rose, lavender, and rosemary. Marco is a gracious host - most helpful with directions and information. We spent three weeks in Italy, and stayed in hotels that were much more expensive, but found none that matched the charm of I Parigi. Every guest that we spoke to at breakfast were, like us, congratulating themselves at finding such a lovely hotel.Thank you again Marco- we look forward to visiting again!", "Date": "Jun 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR622431885", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "sueycat"}, {"Content": "Incredible bed and breakfast This has got to be the best place to stay if you're visiting Florence.

Whilst the weather was poor, so we couldn't take advantage of the pool or outdoor areas, the accommodation was great. There are about 10 rooms set in a rustic (but enormous) stone house overlooking the hills of Florence. The rooms are comfortably furnished -- very clean but by no means glamorous -- and the staff are very accommodating and helpful. Both the owners speak English well which aided us understanding their advice on activities in Florence. The views from the grounds and some of the rooms are just spectacular -- picture postcard like. Whilst it is a fair distance out of Florence (about 20 minutes drive), we found it worked well for us -- we caught the complimentatry 9.15 shuttle every morning and then the bus back of an afternoon which stopped at the bottom of a (very steep!!) hill. The buses run every 30 mins or so and we never had trouble getting one. The tickets are 1 Euro. At night, if we didn't feel like going back into Florence for dinner, we went to the little restaurants in the surrounding villages which were good too. Contrary to one of the entries on this site re breakfast, we found it fantastic -- good croiasants and bread, cereals, fruit juices, nice jams etc. The coffee (Americano or espresso) was excellent. One tip -- spend the 20 Euro on a taxi from Florence when you arrive and depart -- catching the public bus with luggage and then carting it up that hill is just too much. In summary, I would highly recommend this venue -- of our 6 weeks in Europe in many hotels, I think this was the best place we stayed in.", "Date": "Nov 14, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR516418837", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "heaven in Florence AAAHHH!

In April of 2004 we stayed for two nights in I Parigi, located on a beautiful hill overlooking Florence from the South (near the Certosa exit of the Auto Strada--very easy to find). We had the Panorama Room, which meant we had a table and chairs placed so we could look over the turreted walls to see Florence in the distance. The room was spacious, with satellite TV (170 channels) which my husband enjoyed surfing--he even found chanels from former Soviet Republics. Very little English TV, however, but more German than we expected. The grounds were beautiful; the car park spacious. Once one drove up the one-lane narrow stone wall bordered lane, one escaped the very busy road and reached wonderful peace and quiet. The bus to Florence runs from this road--a ten minute walk down a steep hill. We didn't want to take the car out once we got settled because of the narrow lane and busy road, and the owners were very helpful about giving us a marked map, explaining how the bus route worked, and selling us tickets (which one must buy prior to boarding the bus). The only thing we could have used was a listing of local restaurants and shops in the informational binder in our room--we were uncertain where to eat locally, and that very busy road, also lined with high stone walls, didn't encourage much exploration on foot. After we left, we discovered we could have walked to a small town with restaurants and shops (Galluzzo) had we only known. (I'm sure we could have asked and would have received a gracious answer, but we are shy people who hate to bother our hosts). The breakfast room was lovely, as was an airy sitting room with many informational materials in several languages. There were beautiful flowering plants in all public areas and blooming wisteria on the outside wall. In the summer there is a swimming pool.
