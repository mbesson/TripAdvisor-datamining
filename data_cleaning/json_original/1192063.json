The location is central of old madrid. They advertise as having free internet and safe in the room, but; There was not internet in building until front of front door, where they put sofa ( although owner claimed that internet is bad time by time only in my room area) There was safe box in the room but it was not really free as it is said. You need to put 1 \u20ac to lock it and every time you open, you loose that 1\u20ac. My room and bathroom was very small So it may look relatively cheaper on online booking but i do not think it is value for money. You can get nice B&B with character in UK for that money.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moose Jaw, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat location,very clean.\u201d", "Author": "Bloated_ghost", "ReviewID": "UR122850830", "Content": "Angela, the owner was a delight and gracious.Simple, clean rooms and location.

Its convenient location, price, cleanliness and the friendly staff are the best features of this place. There's no breakfast, but there are many places around where you can have a nice breakfast for less than 5 euros. Mr. and Mrs. Sanchez are the nice couple that run the place, you'll feel like at home.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cVery clean, comfortable and safe hostal.

We were greeted by an extremely friendly hostess who was most welcoming and showed us our rooms. They were perfectly big enough (given this is a hostel) and we had an ensuite. Rooms were immaculately clean, and were cleaned every day. We also got fresh towels, something I wouldn't normally expect from a Hostel.Our room had AC and little balcony. Location is great, very easy to walk from the metro, lots of little bars and about 5 minutes from the main shopping area (El Corte Ingles etc). All in all we thought it was excellent value and would certainly return/recommend.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hostal del Pez Azul", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187514-d1192063-Reviews-Hostal_del_Pez_Azul-Madrid.html", "Price": "$46 and up*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Pez, 9</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">28004</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Madrid</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1192063", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/7e/c1/7ec15c41c06bf79aba3164cb1880805a5large.jpg"}}
