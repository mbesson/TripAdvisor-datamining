The receptionist greeted me warmly and complimented me on my spoken Italian. My single room was on the first floor of the main building. It was comfortable with a scrupulously clean en-suite shower room, and a bonus was that it had an outside patio with comfortable seating. Many reviewers have commented on the breakfast offering. I thought it was perfectly adequate with a very good range of foods on offer from cereals to cold meats and cheese, fresh fruit, yoghurts etc. The coffee was very good. The only downside was that the scrambled eggs were invariably cold - I suspect that the food warmer was faulty. I ate in the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant every evening as I found it to be excellent quality and value for money on the first evening. The food was delicious and the house wine was very good indeed. What better after a long day out in Venice? The hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s location on the Lido is very pleasant with nice views over the lagoon. It is about ten minutes walk from the Vaparetto (water bus) station, and if you are too tired to walk there is a bus about every 20 minutes which stops outside the hotel. The staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful throughout, especially the head waiter (Angelo) who really looked after me \u00e2\u20ac\u201c he even went to the trouble of reserving a table for me on an evening where the restaurant was heavily booked.

Its an old villa looking nice outside but management has no soul inside. I came to Venice happy and left with a frown...from this soul-less place. Why? I hurt my leg while in this hotel, and had to be sent to emergency hospital in the night. I returned to hotel past midnite--the next day, could not walk to Breakfast room downstairs. I requested Reception to kindly have someone bring my breakfast from breakfast buffet which is paid with my room charged---since I could not walk--it was not a room service order--but just a humble request for delivering my food from breakfast buffet. When I checked out--they charged me additional for the breakfast--with additional service charge for delivery to my room-- I asked why--as I had breakfast included in my room charge, and I did not order room service--I would not have mind paying for the delivery of my breakfast which has been paid with my room charge---so why charge more? Besides I only had coffee n bread, cereals and egg; while in the breakfast buffet, there are also fruits and ham, croissant and cakes, and juices, etc which they did not bring me. And more importantly---it was a special request from someone who could not walk--that day! (as I was just in hospital the night before). The Manager who I thought would have been more sympathetic and kind-- and out of goodwill can just waive the additional charge--- of only 12 euros--because breakfast has been paid with room and due of my medical condition--it was exceptional request---to deliver but Manager and Reception man were very rude, chauvinistic and added--if they do this service to everyone for free-they would be bankrupt! Then Reception man added another 3 euros for service making the extra charge 15 euros! Its such a small amount--and I told them I will not get poor by paying it--but it was the principle---humanity, consideration--and double charging. Obviously--this hotel has no soul--and no skills in public relations. They did not want to listen to me--even when I said it was not a normal situation--and was just because I was sick and unable to walk down the buffet breakfast table... They were only after gaining additional 15 euros! My breakfast was included in my room charge--why should they double charge me? So I ended up paying additional 15 euros--a small amount----which they gain but losing me and many others who can sympathize that a Management soul is also important in hotel business!

This was the hotel chosen by Insight Vacations for our 2-night stay in Venice. It is a boat ride away from Venice itself where all the action is. The boat stopped directly across the hotel. The hotel looks like a residence from the outside. Beautiful blue hydrangeas greeted us as we walked the path to the hotel's front entrance. There is a charming parlor to the left and the breakfast room to the right of the foyer is pretty. We had to walk up to our room as there was only a tiny elevator. My 1 sister and I shared a room with 2 cot-like beds; it was tiny and looked like a room in a convent. Very sparse, which was very disappointing considering the charming facade and the pretty parlor and dining room on the main floor. My 3 sisters shared a room that was big but looked like a room on a cabin loft instead of a hotel room. There was a king-size bed and a cot inside a windowless cubicle. The staff was not rude but not friendly either. Some of us even commented about this to our tour director who explained that Italians are really quite friendly \"once you get to know them but not when they deal with tourists every single day.\" (I thought: well, the tourists are their bread & butter, so shouldn't they be trained to be more hospitable?) It took forever to get our suitcases into the rooms, so we got impatient and got them ourselves, as there was only 1 person in charge of all the luggages of our group. The dinner was so-so; however, the breakfast was outstanding. Walking around the surrounding area was very interesting. There is a beach area within a few minutes' walk. We found a restaurant a few blocks away where nobody spoke English and the menu was entirely in Italian, so ordering was at our risk. This was my second trip to Venice. On my first trip to Venice, we stayed at the Hotel Marconi which is just several minutes' walk to the Rialto Bridge. It was not as nice as Villa Mabapa; however, we didn't have to take the boat ride to where all the action was---the market, the shops, the many choices of restaurants, and all the \"must-see\" sites of Venice, so my friends and I were able to see more and do more in Venice than my sisters & I did because of the location of Villa Mabapa.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saskatoon, Saskatchewan", "Title": "\u201cOut of the way, but beautiful area\u201d", "Author": "JPP566", "ReviewID": "UR115901089", "Content": "This hotel is not near any of the typical sites in Venice people go to see and is almost 100 euros to get to by water taxi.

After arriving at Marco Polo airport you will need to get either the water taxi (private, at a rate of 95Euros) or the water bus (public transport 13 euros or 26 Euros return). The public water bus runs every hour and takes about an hour. (The private taxi is much quicker). The nearest stop to the hotel is Lido. At Lido, arrived quite late and were surprised that there were no taxis waiting around. The hotel is literally about 800 meters from the boat stop and is to the left of the stop as you come out. Although I was with my boyfriend and at no time did I at any time feel unsafe, female travellers should be aware if they are arriving late that they may need to walk to the hotel along what is a very quiet virtually isolated street. We specifically asked for a room in the pink coloured building as advised in one of the trip adviser reviews and we were not disappointed. The whole hotel was tastefully decorated and the room was to a high standard. The staff was very amiable and extremely professional. We had no complaints whatsoever. We booked on a bed and breakfast basis so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the other meals. The breakfast was continental with the usual selection for all dietary needs. No complaints! When travelling to the sights you will need to either take the water bus or water taxi. We found the waterbus ran very regularly and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s worth buying either 24 or 48 hour travel cards which are quite economic if you plan to travel a lot. Tickets can be purchased from the shop next door to the hotel or the office at the waterbus station To get to Piazzo san Marco which is one of the big touristy areas we either took the No 1 or No52 water bus which took about 10 minutes. The receptionist did inform us of a free trip that the hotel was offering to Murano which is a famous area for making Venetian glass. Unfortunately this was cancelled due to lack of demand and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have enough time to go on our own. The hotel does not have bikes to rent but there is a local shop which rents on either a daily or hourly basis. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to all our friends. The area is quiet so it might not suite youngsters wanting lively nightlife.", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cRoom with a view\u201d", "Author": "happytravel09", "ReviewID": "UR26376131", "Content": "Service was good helpful and staff were serious but polite.

We didn't think much of it and took the bait. So, they call their luggage guy and send us off. The other hotel was not a best western and it was on the other side of the island. If you have ever stayed on the lido I find it alot easier to stay on the port side rather than the beach side. Anyway, we get over the other hotel and decided that it simply doesn't have the charm that BW Villa Mabapa has and chose to go back and wait for our rooms to be ready. The guy was fairly aggressive in trying to get us to stay at the other hotel and made us feel uncomfortable with our decision to stay at our booked location.

When we arrived, we discovered that we were not given two separate beds, but that they were pushed together and dressed with double bed sheets. No problem! They had the chambermaid separate the beds and dress them with new beddings while we went to dinner. The room itself was very nice. We were in the side building and we had plenty of space. I loved the big bathroom with the huge sky light! It was a very charming room. Luckly, during our stay it was sunny and we were able to enjoy the garden area for a drink in the shade. Tea and coffee is very reasonable and presented in a very lovely way. There were just two issues worth noting. One, the hotel offers a complimentary boat ride to Murano island where the glass is made and then a continuing ride to San Marco Square. They do not mention that you dock in Murano directly into a glass making factory. You can not avoid it! It was interesting but you are guided into gift shops where everything is about 5 times as much as it is outside this workshop. Do not buy anything! Also, it is really hard to find where you orginally docked to actually get the boat to San Marco square. Pay attention to where you are walking. The other issue is that they gave us incorrect information about Vaporettos to take you to the airport. We were told that they ran every hour which almost resulted in us taking a 100\u00e2\u201a\u00ac private taxi. But when we went to the vaporetto stop, the boats were going every 20 minute or so.

It allows you to visit the busy areas of Venice then retreat to somewhere quieter in the afternoon or evenign if you want to relax and escape the crowds. To reach the old town area of Venice you need to jump on a local water bus (you can easliy buy a 24hr, 36hr or 72hr bus pass at the airport, your hotel or at the water bus stops).

I booked a \"Std\" room and expected a bit more than this to be honest! 2) Don't be mislead by references to the Lagoon - it is basically the waterway between Venice and the island and not some \"Blue Lagoon\" type paradise I was expecting....Amazing though it is just be set in your mind re what it actually is. 3) Dont book any excursions via the reception desk - you'll find that if you ask anyone in the hotel about attractions, what to do, pricing, where the beach is they all refer you back to reception. This is for a good reason - I asked how much a Gondola ride would be and they quoted me \u00e2\u201a\u00ac150 as the best deal - later on we went to the tourist office on the island and they quoted \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100 for the same deal..... Once we where in venice we got the same deal for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac60!!!!!!! 4) THe hotel blatantly makes alot of money from referring tourists onto other people - they will offer you a free trip to the Malono Glass factory which is definately worth a visit - but bear in mind they tell you they will collect you and drop you off there and once you have finished they will drop you off in Venice - this is C***P! They collect you and leave you stranded on the island and you need to either pay an extortionate water taxi to get back or get the water bus to get back home. 5) The hotel has a nice outside bar - use this as drinks are far cheaper than buying them on the mainland Lido or in Venice. 6) The hotel will offer you a travel card that you can buy to use on as many water bus's as you like - dont buy this its a con and much cheaper to just pay as you go.

We will definitely be back to this hotel.", "Date": "July 14, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "BEST WESTERN Hotel Villa Mabapa", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d202712-Reviews-BEST_WESTERN_Hotel_Villa_Mabapa-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$157 - $398*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "202712", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e7/ca/e7caa8f1fedc4029c81caadfd8837de45large.jpg"}}
