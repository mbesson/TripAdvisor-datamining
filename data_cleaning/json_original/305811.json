This is only useful if you intend to take MTR most of the time and if you are there for three days. From the Airport Express Hong Kong Station, you can either take a taxi or walk back to the hotel. Taxi costs about 30 HKD, depending on traffic. You can also walk from the Sheung Wan and it takes around 15 minutes if you walk at a moderate speed. I read some reviews stating that you could actually take a tram which gets you somewhere near the hotel or that there is a bus from the airport. However, when I sent an email enquiring about public transport options to the hotel, the only answer I got was that I should take a taxi. 2) Location The thing you will realise about this place is that it sells plenty of dried seafood. Everytime we walk back to the hotel, we will smell the dried seafood smell. I'm not particularly adverse to it, but just thought I should mention it. Sometimes, you will see some seafood being dried by the side of the road as well. Safe neighbourhood, with bakeries, convenience stalls, dessert stalls and restaurants all in the vicinity. Shuttle bus from the hotel to various locations, but not from various locations to the hotel. For example, you could take a shuttle bus to Sheung Wan, but you can't take a shuttle bus from Sheung Wan to the hotel, unless you call them. 3) Service Excellent service. Everyone from the concierge to the receptionists were very friendly and polite. The concierge were also responsible for asking you where you were going if you wanted to take the shuttle bus. 4) Room The room was well stocked. When we reached, we had three complimentary fruits and two bottles of water. It oversees the harbour and you can also see the buildings in the neighbourhood. There is an iPhone dock which was really convenient because you didn't even need a charger. Only gripe was that the thick curtains couldn't close fully such that we got awaken by the morning sun daily. 5) Bathroom The bathroom was quite small but suitable for all purposes. Toiletries are also provided. Hairdryer available. 6) Other amenities A swimming pool and a gym is also present in the hotel but we didn't get to use them because we didn't have the time to. Overall This isn't exactly the best location to stay at, if you are looking at shopping near the Kowloon area. However, the presence of shuttle buses to Central MTR may alleviate that problem slightly. Nonetheless, you have to also keep in mind that the shuttle bus ends pretty early so you would have to settle your own transportation back to the hotel. Other than the location (which really isn't that inconvenient if you don't mind a 15-20 minute walk), everything in this hotel was pleasant and worth the price we paid.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kenosha, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, location not what I thought\u201d", "Author": "tamitzer", "ReviewID": "UR133326172", "Content": "The hotel itself was an excellent facility. The rooms are very small, but clean and modern. Only stayed here for two nights because the hotel in Kowloon could only accommodate us for the previous four and we had to find another place. Unfortunately, Kowloon is the place to stay. I prefer locations which are walking distance to shopping, restaurants, and attractions. The neighborhood that the Island Pacific is in seemed to be the everyday working person neighborhood. While it was nice to get a glimpse of the local culture, it was not close enough to walk to the ferry station, which is what had been stated on one of the informational websites. There was a typhoon warning when we were there, so the pool was closed and there was nothing to do nearby, but walk past fish shops and fruit stands. Not even a Starbucks in the immediate neighborhood. Good thing that the internet was complimentary and was a strong connection. On the positive side, the staff were extremely courteous and there was entertainment in the lounge on the Friday and Saturday night that we were there. The dinner buffet was pricey, so we chose to eat in the lounge and even that was pretty expensive compared to some of the places we had been while staying in Kowloon. We did walk about six blocks away and found some small restaurants, one of which we went to on Saturday night. It is certainly not the area for night life. To be fair, we didn't have much of a chance to even get to a public transportation station while there, but I will say that when I visit Hong Kong again, I will definitely stay in Kowloon, at the waterfront, which is absolutely beautiful.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Patong, Thailand", "Title": "\u201cHong kong room.\u201d", "Author": "Exclusive T", "ReviewID": "UR133150045", "Content": "Nice room.

However the tram is only 3mn away by foot, so location turned out not to be an issue at all (even with luggage: bus A10 from the airport drops you 3mn away from the entrance, and on the way back if you wanna take the subway you can get there thanks to the hotel's free shuttle bus, mentioned below). The room is small, alright, but this is Hong Kong's standard so there's not much more to say about it. Everything was clean and we just got disturbed at 9.00 in the morning by the cleaning lady (since we arrived the previous day we wanted to sleep a little bit). However this was dealt with the next day by hanging to the door the \"don't disturb\" paper. Check-in and check-out were no problem (we booked through Zuji.com as we read the deposit from booking.com was not necessarily taken into account) and it is possible to leave the luggage in the hotel if coming too early for check-in or leaving too late for check-out. Also the little shuttle bus provided by the hotel turned out to be quite useful (although not that frequent: every 30-45mn) to join main destinations fast (IFC towers, Central...) and it was no problem to use it even after check-out, to get to the subway. The concierges at the entrance were all very friendly and helpful so we strongly advise to shoot your questions at them. Special mention for the in-room wifi and the 2 free water bottle we got every day. If we have to provide downside, we'd mention the expensive food (but there are plenty of cheap places just outside the hotel to eat breakfast or a full meal) and the difficulty to set the air conditioning on \"not too cold\".

The hotel was recommended by the folks I'm visiting because we could get a good corporate rate and easy to get to where my meetings were. Having said that, if I come back for business again, I would stay elsewhere. The main reason is that it would be nice to walk outside and have a restaurant or bar(s) around, which there aren't any or at least not any that I found. The hotel itself is fine. Everyone is very friendly and the concierge service was excellent. There is shuttle service to Central and the ferry, which I took advantage of and then walked from there but, as taxis are quite inexpensive, I did take those as well. The rooms were fine, with small bathrooms. There was complimentary bottled water, which was nice and a minibar which I didn't use. Upon checkin, I asked for a room higher up, which they agreed to grant me since I was staying her 4 nights. It was worth a shot to ask and glad I did since I had a floor to ceiling window of the harbour. The best part of the room. I ate breakfast one morning, which was a buffet and $20 and not worth it. It was simply mediocre and not at all worth the price. I'd rather grab a coffee later and eat a tasty lunch out (which is what I did). There are a few convenience stores nearby where I bought more bottled water, snacks and beer, which I was glad was nearby. I've read other reviews about the fish smell and I never noticed it, although this is the largest area in the world for selling shark fins. To be honest, I didn't look at any other hotels since this was where it was suggested I stay, so perhaps it is that much cheaper.

Check in and check out were fast and hassle free. Room: my room was upgraded to executive room at 27th floor. Overall the room amenities were alright. The only drawback would be its housekeeping. On the first nite, we found out hairs beneath the floor mat, which was quite disgusting. On the 2nd day, while we were having afternoon nap, one staff pressed the bell, asking whether any housekeeping done for our room. It was quite disturbing actually. In addition, we also spotted hair and stain on the towels.

OK so its not in the 5* league like some hotels in Hong Kong, but you are paying nowhere near the 5* price either.We booked in the UK through British Airways website (although we flew with Qatar!) and paid less than the hotels best direct price. We also got a daily paper and late checkout included. I doubt if any of the top hotels (of which I have stayed in some) could better the standard of customer service and friendliness of the staff which starts the moment you walk through the door, and are relieved of your luggage without asking. The reception staff are very welcoming and rooms clean and inviting. Of course, like all HK hotel rooms they are not over huge, but who, when in HK, spends much time in their room? All the necessities are there, tea and coffee facilities (with extra supplies on request) and complimentary toothbrush, shampoo etc. However as another reviewer has said, up the side street opposite is a 7/11 convenience store and a Watsons (like a Hong Kong version of Boots the chemist) where all necessities can be bought if required. The mini bar in the room is of course expensive (which hotels aren't ?) so I bought beer at 7/11 where its about \u00a31 a pint bottle and sometimes on offer too. The 7/11 sells fresh milk if you prefer it to the hotel sachets of creamer.We had wi-fi in our room and its free, as is wi-fi in reception. The nearest McDonalds if only 5 mins away round the corner from the above stores and is open 24/7 like many others in HK if you crave Western food. One tip for HK..many local small restaurants look like they are for locals only, with Chinese menus outside, but just ask if they have an English menu! Transport from the hotel is good, frequent and cheap. The trams going to the left as you leave the hotel go to Central and right across to Causeway Bay and beyond for a flat fare of less than 20p. To get to the Star Ferry, catch a bus 7, 91 or 94. Once at the SF terminus there are ferries to all the islands, across to Kowloon and buses up to the Peak (15). So, in summary, its a great location, great price, with plenty of local facilities. You can't go wrong! For the best harbour views, get a high floor and try for rooms ending in 08, 09, or 10 (eg 1808). I would be pleased to help anyone with public transport tips as we go everywhere by bus, tram and underground as its so cheap.

The Sheung Wan MTR station is about a 10-15 minutes walk from the hotel but you may opt to take the double-decked tram (fare: HK$2) to reach the station. Bus and tram stops is just around the corner.

We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as there are so many places around about to eat, so I can't comment on that.

I've seen better and seen worse. It was small, but so are most rooms in Hong Kong. If you can get a good deal then it's an ok place to stay, but personally I think there are probably better located hotels for the same ball park price.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cGreat value in HK\u201d", "Author": "hoohoolian", "ReviewID": "UR120721912", "Content": "I was very happy with the Island Pacific.

I happened to turn and see the doors close and thought to myself: \"Sneaky quiet!\" The room was spacious (for HK) and the bed was excellent. There was a mini fridge only half used for purchasable items and some complimentary water. The bath was average. There was a desk with business hook ups. The MTR is a bit of a walk (15 min), but as is with all public transportation -- most things are a bit of a walk: try going to the wrong address and tell me how wonderful public transportation is. I opted to try the breakfast buffet on our last day and just couldn't put anything on my plate. The local and international selections were wholly unappealing. 200 yards away I got a lovely duck quarter for 28 HK$.

The bathroom was nice and complete as well, with 2 sets of toothbrushes and toothpastes, shower cap, ample bath, hand, face and floor towels, and a rubber mat for the bathtub (yes, it has a bathtub too!) to prevent slipping while showering.

The guests in the hotel mostly consist of business travelers from my observation after staying there for 3 nights. The reception staff and the conciege staff were all very nice and helpful in all possible ways to ease our stay in the hotel and were able to provide guidance on how to travel around the island. The deco of the hotel was also stylish in a classic fashion, ensuring a comfortable stay for the guests.

The hotel is 30 minutes from the airport by taxi and overlooks the Hong Kong \u2013 Kowloon Bay. It isn\u2019t near any major shops or restaurants. On arrival hotel porters quickly and efficiently took our luggage up to our rooms. We had booked via lastminute.com and paid for superior rooms. We were initially given rooms on floor 3 and floor 15. We had requested rooms on higher floors so that we might see more or Hong Kong and its landscape. Reception quickly agreed to change our rooms to be on floors 15 and 27. Both of these gave excellent views of the bay. Our rooms had large beds, a desk and small bathroom. The rooms were very clean and well presented upon arrival and bedding and towels were changed regularly. Other reviewers have mentioned small rooms in Hong Kong hotels. I have nothing to compare to locally but the superior rooms we had were fine for one person or a couple. There were similar to many medium priced UK rooms. We had booked on a room only basis. Breakfast was available (cost HK$150) and, on the occasions we eat it, had a good selection of international and Chinese food. Given the cost we would book it as part of the original booking if we visited again as we expect it would have been better value. There were very few restaurants nearby and so we walked or took the tram back into the central zone most evenings. A singer or pianist provided entertainment in the hotel bar some evenings. My colleague used the swimming pool and gym. The pool is outdoor (as very many other hotels) and the water was cold and seemed to have a slight \u201ctaste\u201d which he thought may have been due to vehicle fumes. It didn\u2019t stop him using it on several occasions though. Free Wi-Fi is available throughout the hotel. Free wired internet is also available in the rooms. All staff were very friendly and took a pride in their jobs. On one occasion a taxi we were expecting failed to arrive and the reception manager was very helpful, he called our Chinese supplier to explain the delay and arranged alternative transport. We did not speak Chinese so his assistance was very useful. The hotel provided a free shuttle bus to the conference centre for the Trade Fair. Overall a good hotel and I would stay there again. A few observations about Hong Kong itself: We had expected mosquitoes but had no problem at all in any part of Hong Kong or Kowloon. The hotel is about 30 minutes walk from the main Central part of Hong Kong Island. If you are staying more than a couple of days I recommend you buy an Octopus travel card from one of the railway station customer service desks. This allows you to swipe your fare on trams, buses, ferries, MTR trains and can be used in many convenience stores (7-11, Circle K etc) to buy your shopping. Using the card is far easier than having to find exact fares and being left with a pocket full of small coins. Hong Kong shops sell original goods not fakes so prices are similar to the UK. China is an hour away by train and you can get a 5 day visa at the border. The shops across the border don\u2019t sell originals \u2026. Use the Peak Tram to go to the top of the island; MTR and cable car to visit the Buddhist Temple on Lantau Island. Both are great places to visit.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Andorra", "Title": "\u201cHotel Island Pacific\u201d", "Author": "Manukay", "ReviewID": "UR119745055", "Content": "Stayed there by mistake because had not booked the usual hotel.

We have to carry our big luggage to the second floor where the front desk located. The escalator is so narrow and steep. Beware. The first floor, they have two doors facing different direction. For taxi, it usually comes to the door which face inside to a basement of the building. For walking outside of the hotel, usually the guests use the other door. Confusing. The room is so unbelievably small. It's standard room. I've never become a demanding guest and when I write a hotel review, I try my best to be objective, looking to see all the positives and negatives of the hotel where I stayed from my point of view. You can prove it by reading all my reviews about hotels where I stayed in this site. Somehow, I think for this hotel, I have more negatives opinions than the positive ones. When we checked-in, they said that they would take care all of our luggage to each of the room. I booked 2 rooms, one for my family and one for my parent. Based on that promise, we directly go to the first floor again to continue exploring Hong Kong while we still have time and energy to do that. Surprisingly, when we got back to the hotel at 10 pm, the luggage are still not there as promised by the hotel staffs. We have to wait for almost an hour until they send our luggage. We are tired, want to take a shower, change clothes, brush teeth and use our own toiletries etc so it really makes me upset to wait and wait....until they send the luggage to my room. There are only 2 good points I can address about this hotel. First, it is located in a strategic location. It's near to Hong Kong tram and near to a local market so you can get your breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, groceries, etc along the streets nearby. Second, the view is awesome. It's near the sea so from the high floor room, you can see all those jet ferries come and go from the Star ferry pier. FYI, the standard rooms cost me USD 188,2 for 2 rooms. That means USD 94.1 per room. It was expensive compare to what I got: a very tiny room.

It is not near the subway station, so I have to find out more about the local places and transportation. Transportation: There are several ways to travel to and from the airport, including taxi (HK$300), hotel airport bus (HK$140 pp), airport train plus free hotel shuttle (HK$100 pp), and so on. I chose the City airport bus #A10 (HK$48 pp): purchase an Octopus card in the airport terminal, walk towards the right outside the airport terminal, look for the A10 bus stop, get on, about 40 min later, get off the first stop after the cross-harbor tunnel. The hotel is just half a block from the stop. Getting back to airport by the City Airport bus mode is more difficult as you have to walk west three blocks along the tramway to the bus stop on Water Street. To get around to different parts of Hong Kong, the subway station is a long walk away. The hotel does provide free shuttle service to ferry terminal and central area, but the interval is 30 minutes and I did not have the patience. I tend to take the tram near the hotel and go East, and you will arrive near the Sheung Wan subway station. If I need to go Kowloon side, I would walk a block east along the tram way, and look for the bus 109, 104, and 113. In any case, taxi in HK is relatively cheap and convenient. It seems there is always taxi right off the hotel entrance waiting for you. Good news is that the subway is being extended towards the hotel. When completed in around 2014, the subway station will only be about a block away. There is a reception desk on the ground floor, and the check-in is on the next floor. One thing I noticed was that the bellboys were very friendly and efficient. They would smile and open door for you. They would eagerly hail taxi for you and bring your luggage to your room. Wonderful friendly and efficient service! The room is OK size, but it would be very tight if you have more than two people. The bed is comfortable but the lighting is horrible. There is not enough light to read unless you sit at the desk. The view from my room is only OK as it faces high rise residential apartments. I heard the north facing room got beautiful harbor view. The TV has many channels including Chinese, CNN, BBC, movie and sports channels. There are several channels in other languages also. This is the best hotel TV channel package I have ever experienced. The free wifi internet connection in the room is fast and stable. Very NICE! Service was prompt. One day, they forgot to give us the two free bottles of water. I called the front desk, and within 30 seconds, the maid arrived smiling with the bottles of water and apologized. Impressive service! Wonder how they did that! The safe in my room did not work properly, you may want to double check before locking your valuables inside. For laundry, I used the Kwok Wah laundry, about a block up the Central Street. It cost me HK$30 or US$4 for seven pounds of cloths. Got my cloth washed and dried within three hours, not bad. Be forewarned that they wash all your cloth in a batch. You may want to separate your whites from colors first. This is area of dry goods shops, so you will smell some fish and so on. However, there are plenty of small caf\u00e9 and restaurants nearby. Circle K and 7/11 shops are just around the corner. Also, if you know where to look, you can find great shopping bargains. I got several jeans for US$8 each, and they tailored fit the length for me for free while I wait, NICE! If you want to shop and eat Western, fancy styles, this may not be the place. However, if you do not mind experiencing how the locals live, enjoy great value and service, and bargain shopping, this hotel is quite convenient.

However, my long trip to the region was all but complete and I merely sought out a cheap place for my last couple days. As far as layover/short stay hotels, IPH is not bad. I got a decent rate ($1,000HK/night), and upon check in, they upgraded me to an \"Executive\" room on one of the top floors, which boasted a splendid view of HK Harbour. Kudos and thanks to the desk staff for this upgrade. The room was okay, a bit worn down, rough around the edges, but the worst element was the bed, which felt like a cheap spring box mattress, only much stiffer. Part of this may be cultural. Asians traditionally like hard bed surfaces. I lived in Japan for a few years and got used to sleeping on thin futons on the floor. In my travels in Korea, I saw people sleeping on heated marble-stone beds! But I'm not Asian and when I travel in Asia, I much prefer a Western style mattress - soft and cushy. The desk staff at IPH were great, very friendly and efficient. The room service, same. Different story when I went to use the swimming pool. The two staff pool guys didn't even really acknowledge me, much less offer me a towel, and I was the only guest on deck!. The pool itself was refreshing, a great amenity if you are in HK during the hot & sticky times of the year. But during my visit in early September, there were ants crawling all over the deck of the pool and after a quick dip I didn't see much point in lingering on deck chairs lined with small army ants. I had already stayed at the nearby Courtyard Marriott so was very familiar with the location and neighbourhood. Some reviewers complain about this location, but I find it an interesting, less touristed, quieter part of town, a nice respite from the frantic pace of the more central districts. Public transit (especially the tram) into Central is breeze, and dirt cheap. At the end of the day, I describe IPH as a 2.5-star hotel trying desperately hard to be a 3.5 or 4-star hotel. Peel away the high rise facade and glossy web site images and it's a pretty uninspiring property, not a place I would like to stay longer than a day or two.

The room was really big - nice comfortable double bed and great bathroom with all the toiletries you need and more, and a separate bath and shower.

Overall we really enjoyed our stay at the Island Pacific Hotel. The staff were very friendly and always did their best to help. The hotel itself was very clean and both rooms were clean and not too small. There is a fridge in each room where you can put bottles of water the night before to cool so you can take them out with you the next day, as well as a safe to store any valuables you leave behind while you are out. There is an outdoor swimming pool which is fairly compact and watched over by a couple of lifeguards who could do with some lessons from the rest of the staff. They can be slightly rude sometimes (when they are not texting or sleeping!) but overall they were not a huge issue. There is also a gym with some cardio / weights equipment but we did not use this so cannot comment on it.

However there are frequent trams, buses and taxis right outside the door so the location of the hotel was not a problem for us.

However, there are some finer points I would like to note. Our room was very spacious, (even by non-HK standards) however, we had been upgraded from a standard room to an executive room on the sub-penthouse level (28th floor), which is one of the reasons we were satisfied with the value we received for what we paid. We had an excellent view, the room was clean, the layout of the floor was such that you didn't see many (or in our case, any) other guests. I felt the hotel had a good atmosphere, the lobby is impressive, and the doorman/concierge on the lower level was always courteous. This was my second time in Hong Kong so I already knew my way around and the free shuttle to Central (and Airport Express, etc.) was very useful. I might not recommend this location to first-timers, as it is not conveniently situated for wandering around or exploring, but if you are a business traveller or a traveller who knows what sites/areas you want to see, then this is an ideal hotel. On the negative side, I only had one issue. I had some difficulty connecting to the wifi and called the front desk several times to have this corrected. They seemed to tell me every time \"ok, we've reset it, try again in 10 minutes.\" After this didn't work, and since I was on my way out, I went down the front desk. They very convincingly told me, \"yes, we've fixed it, when you go back up to your room it will be working.\" Well, it wasn't. It might be a small issue for some, I felt they could have been more helpful and understanding.

More \"simple\" life as compared to Kowloon as u can see housewives, butchery and shops selling \"hai wei\" such as sharks fins, etc. The room is worth the price paying as it is clean, although the carpet is a little old but they provide room slippers, that's not an issue. Pillow alittle soft but they provide additional pillow.3. and complete amenities, toothbrush, shampoo, etc. Don't think this is basic, some hotels in HK don't provide that, the space is relatively big as compared to like Half the size I Have ever stayed it.

The staff we spoke to were very helpful and quickly sorted out our request to remove feather pillows etc. from one of our rooms after we arrived. We loved the location of the hotel, close to 'Dried Seafood Street', as it seemed to have much more character than the flashy shopping areas in the centre of Hong Kong. We found the trams so cheap and fun to use (although not with luggage!). On our departure we were very impressed with the hotel's free shuttle 'bus' service to the Airport Express station, which was actually a hotel car. We didn't eat in the hotel at all, but economised by making do with trips to the nearby 7-Eleven or Circle A convenience shops to get breakfast supplies. Although the hotel's website mentioned free wifi in the lobby only, it turned out we could use the wifi from our room free of charge, which was very convenient.

I had no great expectations of the place as it was quite cheap for the location. I ended up very impressed by my stay. The thing which makes this hotel stand out are its staff. Every single member of staff there went out of their way to make me feel welcome and to ensure my every need was met. I was even asked at one point if my expectations of the escalator had been met! The standard of staffing is as good as some of the significantly more expensive hotels in HK. I cannot fault any one of them. Standard of English spoken was at least \"acceptable\" for all staff. Most very good or excellent. The room was an \"Executive\" which is about \"standard\" size in a regular British hotel. The harbour view is a wonderful bonus for the money, the city scape view the other way also great. The bed was comfy, the room was quiet and I slept like the dead (I am prone to insomnia). Basic room amenities are provided. Some of the decor is showing its age and there was sign of a recent repair which had been patched over. This didn't bother me. Everything was clean, tidy, comfortable and worked well. Broadband is provided free in the room, but it is wired not WiFi so only laptops etc. with a LAN connector will be able to use it not your phone or iPad. I ate in the hotel a lot. This is because the food was good and very well priced. Also because of the area (more on this later). Breakfast is a buffet of Asian interpreted international standards. The scrambled egg has wasaabi in it. There is boiled pork loin and pan fried ham alongside hash browns. Best breakfast I've had in a hotel in a while. The evening meal is either from the menu (mostly pizza and pasta) or a buffet which again is an eclectic mix of stuff like Duck A la Orange in one pot and some fried squid curry in the next. I don't eat seafood but I did notice they had a lot of local fresh catch of the day dishes on for those who do. This was less than $200 HK for \"all you can eat\" and the deserts are superb. There are two bars in the hotel (linked by a staircase) and one sells nice sandwiches and so forth. The hotel is located in the Western District and not terribly convenient for the MTR. You can catch a Taxi easily or for the more adventurous there are trams and buses which run the main drag alongside the hotel very regularly. I preferred to walk down to Sheung Wan MTR station and take in the local atmosphere. What you won't find locally are bars or restaurants or anyone who speaks much English! There are cafes but they are very much the traditional Chinese type but very cheap. You can also buy cheap street food, such as fried noodles for just a few HK dollars. There are also a few local bakeries where you can grab something, and the pastries are delicious, but for proper \"dining\" you need to go further afield. There are some seafood restaurants not too far away but I don't eat it so I can't say if these are good. There are several nice looking eateries in the Western Market building which is a 10 minute walk away offering a range of foods and English signage. I haven't tried these either but they looked good. The area the hotel is in is in the dried fish quarter and there is certainly a lot of \"local colour\" walking around the stalls and shops. The area is busy and felt very safe even late at night. if you \"like\" the Hotel on Facebook you get either a free breakfast or a 10% discount on your bill (excluding the room rate) I have business in Hong Kong and when I am next there on my own on business I will very likely stay here again.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pontedera, Italy", "Title": "\u201cdisappointment\u201d", "Author": "luca0060", "ReviewID": "UR103756949", "Content": "The Hotel is positioned in front of the harbour in Hong Kong island; beautiful view, but a little far away from the Central Station.

The Island Pacific Hotel meets these criteria. At around US$100 a night it compares favorably with its more upmarket competitors. The rooms are small, but adequate. There is wi-fi and the breakfast, although a little expensive at HK$150, is varied and caters for all tastes. Their description of a \"sea view\" can be a little confusing. You might have to stretch a little to see around the construction of another tower block unless you are in rooms 1 to 6 on the floor so be specific in your booking if you want a nice view and dont trust the description on the web site.

I flew into Hong Kong airport and took the efficient airport express train to Hong Kong Station (the end of the route) which takes about 20-30 minutes. I then got a taxi to the hotel which cost a very reasonable \u00a33 or so. Despite the fact Hong Kong can be expensive, taxis seem fairly cheap. If I'd known my way around, I could probably have just about wheeled my bag to the hotel. Several people have commented on the lack of proximity to an MTR station, however it's not a huge distance. It's 0.6 miles to the nearest underground station and 1 mile to Hong Kong station where the airport express drops off . If you walk out the hotel front door and look right on Connaught Road you can see the Shun Tak Centre building which is roughly where the nearest underground station is located. On most days I took a pleasant morning walk along the harbour front to the underground. The room was of modest size but comparable to what I would expect to receive in the UK for a mid-range hotel. Americans may find it small by the standards of typical US hotel rooms. Slight niggles were being unexpectedly asked for a $HKD500 (about \u00a341) deposit on arrival. Apparently this was with respect guaranteeing bar and mini-bar charges that may be accrued. I don't know if this kind of deposit is usual in Hong Kong. There were however no issues with this. I proffered my credit card, I didn't use any hotel services and no charges were made to my card. It would have been nice to include free wi-fi with the room, however few hoteliers seem to offer this. I'm hoping one day someone will buck the trend. If you're after free wi-fi, I found it in statue square. The room wasn't perfectly quiet, with the hotel being near a major road intersection. There is a constant distant rumble of traffic at most hours. The view from the hotel window across the harbour was fabulous and is probably this hotel's greatest asset (see attached photo). Spent almost an hour watching the boats go by at night. The floor to ceiling window is great, the sort of thing you'd find in a trendy city apartment. The hotel staff were very good and there were lots of people instantly available. I didn't have to wait long for anything and everything was dealt with efficiently. What really tells you about the quality of customer service is what happens when things go wrong. When I checked out, I thought I'd use the free shuttle bus service to the airport express. However after a short wait, it transpired the bus wasn't available. The concierge was extremely concerned about getting me to my flight on time, so offered to find and pay for a taxi and sent someone out to flag one down for me. After about ten minutes, they were unable to find a taxi and so the concierge fetched a Mercedes car and a chauffeur to take me to the station instead. Excellent service, I don't think other hotels would have gone to so much trouble. If you are using the airport express, you can check your bags in with most airlines at Hong Kong station up to 24 hours before the flight. If you have a flight later in the day, I'd highly recommend doing this, it's a great (free) service and gets rid of your luggage so you can go out and do something. Something else I would recommend is getting an Octopus card for the MTR. This is identical to an Oyster card in London. There is a special one for tourists which provides 2 airport express journeys and 3 days unlimited underground travel. You can pick this up at the airport in arrivals.

I was hosted in this hotel just because my business trip included it with a special rate. This hotel is very bad located, indeed is in a corner of Hong Kong, far from the metro, when you go to the reception they tell you \"you have to walk 15 minutes to find the metro station\". The room has decent size, but what about the facilities ! the gym is almost a sad joke, is tiny tiny tiny, just with 3 machines and some weights, the swimming pool other sad history really tiny, there where two guys to help you with the towels but with them near the pool was like too many persons, almost a crowd. The only positive about the hotel is the access to the airport but for the casual traveler that knows how to take the bus, just take the A10 line and it practically left you 20 meters from the hotel (dont forget coins or your *octupus card). Take Note: Dont be mistaken by the 15 minutes walk to the next metro station! take the cute Tramway that accepts the octupus card, just HKD 2 per way and it has one stop some meters from the hotel, forget about the metro and have fun. + What i like. - If you have to stay in this hotel for any strange reason the only positive thing is that you arrive to it very easy from the airport taking the bus A10 on the airport exit. (like 48 HK$ each way, discount if you use your octupus card for the go and return the same day, i explain about octupus later) -The personal try to be polite and courteous. -If you want to take a new girlfriend you made in hong kong it will be easy here, almost normal in Hong Kong. - If you need to eat at a reasonable price then you can walk like 5 blocks from de voeux road against city center and find a japanese fast food very known in China. (around 30-36 HK$ per dish) + What i dislike - The awful location, very far from the city center, from the action, surrounded by depots and small shops, you can get much better for the same or lower price in HKG. - There is NOT Free wifi in the rooms, it cost you PER HOUR and is not cheap, the only way is to go to the lobby where there are only some chairs so if you need to enter urgently then is very possible you wont find space. - The happy ladies that start to appear in the lobby after 1:00 am + The Tips: - BUY the octupus card once you arrive to hong kong airport, this is THE WAY to know hong kong, it is accepted by the metro, buses and the very cute tramway !!!, also it saves you from having to have the exact change or buy tickets every time. - Dont be like a new tourist and take the airport express once you arrive, just take the bus A10, that stops in several hotels, and as this hotel is very far from the center is one of the first stops, the bus left you almost 20 meters from the door. - To get the hotel dont take the taxi, less the metro, take the cute tramway !!!, and use your charged octupus card :D ! the stop is some meters from the hotel's door - By the way, if you use the tramway dont take the one that says final stop western market ! it will let you far from the hotel, you must take the one that has the final stop at Kennedy Town, which runs more and left you near the hotel.

I stayed 13 nights in a standard room, checked in at 9am an was immediately taken to my freshly prepared room well before check-in time. The room was on the 26th floor facing northwest and I had a decent view of the busy harbour. The room was understandably but had all the comforts - a desk to work, multiple toiletries, a kettle, and a good sized closet. The safe needed it's batteries replaced, but a small call to the front desk later and the problem was taken care of right away. The neighbourhood (Sheung Wan/Western Market) is...well... quiet. Not much going on. But the outdoors are quiet and good for sleeping. The hotel is 1 km away from the western terminus of the island line MTR and this has been a complaint for some reviewers. Fortunately, the hotel offers a free shuttle transfer to Hong Kong station / IFC mall practically every 30 min. If you don't catch them on time, take the inexpensive tram ($2 HK). The line runs right past the hotel and takes you the width of the island. The internet fees are a bit of a drag ($30 HK for an hour, $98/day). But visit any PCCW store for example, and you can purchase internet cards for cheap. The trouble is, the hotel's wifi connection with these outside networks is weak - so coffee shops will have to do instead. If you want to use free internet terminals for short durations, purchase a snack at a Pacific Coffee location (the closest to the hotel is at Des Voeux and Rumsey streets). I did not try the pool or restaurant - There's simply so much else to do and see in HK. The bar is a nice place to sit and have a drink (prices are the same as for other bars ~55 for a pint) before you head out for the night. If you do stay out late and can't take the MTR back, to give you a sense of cab fares: ~$100 HKD from Tsim Sha Tsui and ~$65 from Causeway bay (the price of just one of the many drinks I'm sure you enjoyed).

While you're a bit westward, we did walk from the main bar district (Lan Kwai Fong) to our hotel (probably 20+ mins). The price (~C$100/night) seemed reasonable given the location and the amenities. I've stayed in Kowloon (near Jordan stn) and Causway Bay on previous visits and this hotel ranks on the same level with the lower price balancing out the location (remember, taxis are cheap in HK so not a big deal, in my opinion). Overall, good value considering where you're located. I would recommend this hotel but there are plenty of hotels to choose from in HK so I wouldn't suggest this to be a place you had to absolutely stay at but a good choice nonetheless.", "Date": "September 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Midlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat facilities\u201d", "Author": "Dallas2Raleigh", "ReviewID": "UR77008997", "Content": "The Island Pacific Hotel is just outside the hussle and hassle of Central, but still close enough to be a few minutes away from the action.

I spent 14 nights there in an executive room which was a generous size and had a huge bathroom by Hong Kong standards and the view was fantastic looking over Victoria Harbour and the Tsing Ma bridge. Both tram stops and bus stops are approx 50m away and I never had to wait any more than 2 minutes for a bus. Taxis were plentiful and the concierge team never had a problem hailing a taxi for me. In the vacinity there was a Vanguard convience store, Japan Home Centre, Watsons and a Wellcome supermarket at the top of the hill. The hotel's swimming pool is small but clean and well maintained, likewise the gym facilities. The hotel restaurant was buffet only and a bit overpriced but room service was very reasonable. There is a lack of restaurants in the direct area, but in exploring I did pass a McDonalds 1 block away. I didn't use the internet facilities at the hotel, they were expensive and there's free use of terminals in some of the coffee shop chains like Pacific Coffee.

The service that was provided was very friendly and sometimes even felt a bit excessive, but I guess that is a nice thing. I tried also the buffet dinner at the hotel as I got one person for free. The price normally is around 280HKD+10% SF. The food is mostly delicious but it's lacking variety. I was actually a bit disappointed at first but I found out the reason for the lack of food as the buffet is also all you can drink.

I can\u2019t recommend the hotel enough for its excellent customer care, service and facilities. SERVICE. The hotel prides itself of hygiene, generosity and courteous service. Apart from the easy check-in and check-out system, the helpful bellboys and the free shuttle bus transfers to select places, the hotel is truly a league of its own. The cleaning staff made sure that our beds were made and our towels changed every day. They also restocked our daily supply of personal care provisions (toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, conditioner, bath gel and body lotion). A copy of the South China Morning Post made its way to our room each afternoon. We even had a complimentary bowl of fresh fruits arranged neatly on our mini-bar. Don't you find this just wonderful? My sister and I were just so lucky to find vacancies despite showing up without reservations. We were so pleased that the receptionist gave us a tip on how to avail of discounted room rates. He booked us for one night only (on the day we showed up at 1035 HKD) and then advised us to reserve the remaining nights online. We were able to save 375 HKD per night on our succeeding stays by following his advice. ROOM. We stayed at Room 1014 (a non-smoking standard room with twin beds). It was a quaint and cozy room with Western interior design and a fantastic view of the sea. My sister and I are petite, so room size was not a problem. In fact, we were quite impressed with the way the hotel utilized the space. Our room was supposed to be the cheapest yet Island Pacific Hotel made sure that we did not miss out on our creature comforts. We had our own mini-bar where the staff replenished our daily supply of coffee, tea and sugar, an electric kettle, a refrigerator, a safe, an iron and ironing board, a handy multiple plug adaptor and a bathtub and shower (with good water pressure). We were also able to enjoy a variety of TV channel selections (including CNN, BBC, AXN and Discovery Channel) and FM stations. AMENITIES. Of the hotel\u2019s many amenities \u2013 swimming pool, gym and restaurant \u2013 we made the most use of the business lounge in the 27th floor. The rates are not the cheapest for internet use (40 HKD for 30 minutes), printing (2 HKD for every page) and faxing (5 HKD for every page), but the hotel invited us to enroll in the 98 HKD membership program which allowed us to use the computer and avail of free-flowing coffee, tea and snacks for the whole day. LOCATION. The complimentary shuttle service is god-sent, but we ventured walking around the area and we were able to reach Sheung Wan MTR Station, Shun-Tak Center, Wing-On Department Store and the Macau Ferry Terminal on foot. There are two 7-11 shops close to the hotel. One is on the same block but you have to make a U-turn to get there. The other one is a block away facing Watson\u2019s. We weren\u2019t able to check out the MacDonald\u2019s branch but it\u2019s actually on the same block as Watson\u2019s (just take a left when you reach the corner). The IFC Mall (which doubles as an MTR station) is just 21 HKD away by taxi. The surroundings of the hotel have an \u201cauthentic\u201d Hong Kong feel. If you want to experience Western comforts in an Asian atmosphere, then Island Pacific Hotel is certainly the place to be. Good price, value for money and interesting location are reasons enough to choose Island Pacific Hotel. For us, the best deal maker by far was the hotel staff themselves.

The executive lounge was certainly nothing to drag about, a small room with tea and cookies. The view from our room though was spectacular towards the harbour and ferries leaving to Macao.

There were some comments in TripAdvisor about the area and the smell of fish drying in shops. We have been in the area both during summer and winter and to our noses the smell was exotic to the most, but not unpleasant. The are around the hotel is literally filled with shops that sell dried fish, shark finns and other Asian sea-related foods and herbs. To us the area has a pleasant and certainly different flavor.

We were planning to spend one week in a hotel in Hong Kong and another week in Kowloon. Prior to the trip, I did a substantial amount of research and came across a restauranteur's comment regarding Karl Law at the Island Pacific Hotel. That individual spoke very highly of Mr. Law and how he took care of her stay at Island Pacific. Out of all the hotels in Hong Kong, I decided to book Island Pacific first because of the price and positive comments that I read. After a week's stay, we decided to extend our stay at the hotel for the second week. This is highly due to the service we received from Mr. Law. We arrived at 8:00am Saturday morning, not expecting to have a room immediately. However, Mr. Law was on duty and offered to give us a room right away. While we waited for the room to be prepared, he offered us complimentary drinks at the lounge. In addition, he upgraded us to an ocean view instead of a city view room. After we decided to stay for an extra week, Mr. Law was extremely accommodating and offered to upgrade our room to a suite on the executive floor. During the room switches, he always took care of the luggage so that we never had to move them around ourselves. When we arrived to our room in the evening, all of our belongings were already there. Moreover, Mr. Law has excellent speaking skills in English which made him very effective in being able to attend to visitors. He also very polite, very approachable, very humble, and very friendly. Whenever we came across a problem, he was always able to take care of it and resolve it immediately. We experienced some problems with the drainage in the bathtub so we requested assistance from the front desk during the evening. After a couple nights and much frustration from the lack of service we received, we approached Mr. Law about it on the third morning. When we returned to the room that evening, someone had already come to the room to fix the problem. My daughter ran into some problems connecting her laptop to the hotel's internet a couple of times so when she went down to the front desk for help. 3 members of the night shift staff attempted to fix the problem, however they showed impatience with her and were still unable fix it after at least half an hour of waiting. She went to Mr. Law the next morning and he was able to fix it with ease, and always with patience and willingness. I hope that the management of the Island Pacific Hotel knows and appreciates what an exceptional job Mr. Law is doing for the company. He is an extremely valuable employee who deserves recognition, we could see him belonging to a 5 star hotel. I've been to many cities in North America and Asia but never have I received service from the front desk like I did for those two weeks from Mr. Law. He consistently and unconditionally goes out of his way to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. Mr. Law greeted us every morning with a smile, and we couldn't thank him more for making our vacation such a memorable one. The next time we return we'll be sure to stay at the Island Pacific Hotel in Hong Kong. I would also like to add that the concierge and bellboys from the ground floor were also very friendly and helpful, always smiling and willing to assist.

The air conditioning is adjustable using a thermostat which is great. Internet is 300HKD for a week, which is about average. I'm still not sure why it costs in Hong Kong hotels. The concierges are exceptionally helpful. Taxis are about 25HKD into Central, or you can get the nearby tram for 2HKD. I tended to get a taxi in to avoid getting sweaty and then get a tram back in the evening. There is also a frequent shuttle bus run by the hotel. If you need to head to Kowloon, the tunnel is very close so a taxi is pretty cheap. The area is pretty different to \"tourist\" areas of Hong Kong. Most shops nearby sell dried fish products, and a lot of the restaurants have no English menu. If you're willing to experiment with food, and take it as it comes, everyone is willing to persist with pidgin English and you'll end up with a decent meal. There is a McDonalds nearby, and Central has a lot of places to eat. I didn't try the food in the hotel. A few other reviews have mentioned that the area feels unsafe at night. It's largely residential, there's not many bars, and the Western police station is a couple of hundred meters away. On the downside, I think even the non-smoking rooms have people smoking in them. My room didn't smell, but people on my non-smoking floor were smoking. This seems pretty common in Asia. The selection of free TV is a bit poor as well, not a problem if you are on holiday but if on business and just needing to veg out in the evening, it can be a bit dull.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Turku, Finland", "Title": "\u201cDecent room with excellent value.\u201d", "Author": "Maunolito", "ReviewID": "UR63190891", "Content": "I stayed two nights in Superior Harbour View room.

Free hotel shuttle to Central MTR, Macau ferry, Landmark, etc. 2. Clothes line over the bathtub- convenient for anyone who stays for an extended period of time and needs to do some light laundry. 3. Mini refrigerator \u2013 It was meant as a mini bar, but I used it to store milk since I usually drink a glass of milk everyday. 4. Electric teapot- boils water in no time. 5. Sufficiently clean. but room is quite small. Had a view of the harbor , but it was foggy during most of our stay. 6. Friendly bellhops and whenever I called for services, they were at my door almost immediately. 7. I never ate at any of the hotel restaurants. Instead I went to the small restaurants and bakeries nearby. Definitely one way to save money. The bakeries have excellent buns, cakes and pastries. If you do not like congee (rice porridge), some of the restaurants serve toasts, coffee, etc. 8. I was upgraded to a room on the Executive floor, but it is still quite small. In other words, great value for the price. Cons: 1. The vent in the bathroom is also on, thus it gets quite noisy at night. 2. Whenever my neighbor opened or closed their door, my door slammed as well, as if someone was trying to open MY door. And this went on all day ! It\u2019s loud enough to wake you up in the middle of the night. 3. Though the room is decently cleaned, the maid did not vacuum the floor. 4. The toilet\u2019s water pressure is weak. You need to flush several times. Though I had a pleasant experience staying at this hotel, there was one incident that I was not very happy with. BEWARE OF HOW YOU WILL BE CHARGED WHEN YOU CHECK OUT. When I checked out, the charge on the hotel itemized receipt was in HKD. However, when I signed the credit card receipt, it was in both HKD and USD. The exchange rate on the credit card receipt was 7.5 (instead of the current market exchange rate of approxmiately 7.7 ). I called the hotel and asked about whether I will be charged in HKD or USD. The hotel said in HKD. The way how my credit card company works is when I charge something in local currency, my credit card company converts local currency charge into USD, and the conversion rate is based on that day\u2019s market exchange rate (in this case, 1 USD =approx 7.7611 to 7.766 HKD) . However, I checked my credit card bill and found out that I was charged the already converted USD amount that was on the credit card receipt, based on the hotel\u2019s exchange rate of $1 USD = $7.5 HKD.

Firstly, the location. It's on the waterfront in the Sheung Wan district, just to the west of the Central area (the main business and shopping district). The area itself is completely Chinese which, for me, was a great experience - as other parts of the city are quite westernised. It might seem a bit intimidating when you first arrive, as you won't see many other westerners on the streets - but it's a really safe area, so absolutely nothing to worry about. It's about a 10-15 minute walk to the nearest underground station, and probably around 35 minutes walk to the Central area. But by far the best way to get into the centre and beyond is by tram - as they're cheap as chips, and go right past the hotel. It's really easy - you just jump on at the back, and pay the $2 flat rate fare (less than 20p!) as you get off. If you're arriving from the airport with luggage, I'd recommend taking the Airport Express train to Hong Kong Station ($100/less than \u00a310), and then getting a taxi to the hotel (about $30/less than \u00a33). My room was a standard twin, which was perfectly nice. Not massive, but plenty big enough for me. It was spotlessly clean, along with the nice marble bathroom (with a good shower over the bath). I had an LCD tv, with all the usual international channels (CNN, BBC World News etc) - and there was an FM radio with iPod docking station on the bedside table, which was a nice touch. The view from my room was superb - I had a corner window, with one side looking out over the harbour (to the west, so not towards the famous skyscrapers in Central), and the other side facing towards the surrounding tower blocks. The floor-to-ceiling windows were probably the best feature of the room. There was only one real downside - and that was the lack of free wifi (you have to pay for internet access). There seemed to be one internet computer in the bar area, but it was always being used whenever I checked. As I result, I spent quite a bit of time loitering in shopping malls, using their free wifi instead! The hotel staff were lovely - really friendly, and all spoke great English. Checking in and out was easy - and they were happy to look after my bags after I'd checked out, as I had a late flight. They hailed me a taxi to the station, too . I didn't eat or drink in the hotel, but there's a restaurant and bar (the advertised buffet looked a bit expensive). I'd recommend paying a visit to the 7-11 across the road for water and other general supplies, and the Hamburg Cake Shop just opposite the 7-11 for some authentic Chinese breakfast (pork buns, etc). The bar never looked very lively but, then again, I doubt many people come to a great city like Hong Kong to stay in the hotel bar! There's a small gym (which I didn't use, but looked quite good) and a pool (which I used once). It wasn't massive, and not that deep - but was a nice way to cool off after a day in the heat of the city. If you get offered this hotel as part of a cheap deal, you should jump at the chance to stay there. I'd definitely do so again.", "Date": "September 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Budapest, Hungary", "Title": "\u201cGreat choice for price-concious traveller\u201d", "Author": "fter", "ReviewID": "UR39984895", "Content": "We stayed for 4 nights in late May 2009, room 914. It's not a bad location, not \"central\" but the tramline runs outside the door of the hotel so everywhere is easily reached. And taxis are not expensive in HK relative to in the west. The street outside is lined with dried-fish shops which makes the street a bit smelly but for me this is just local atmosphere and didn't bother me in the slightest. The hotel was not smelly I must add! Generally this is a \"Chinese\" area. It's a nice 10 mins walk to Soho area for loads of \"western\" restaurants. We - 2 adults and 2 small kids - were travelling around Asia on a budget and were afraid of high hotel costs in HK. We got a recommendation to this hotel from a fellow traveller and it worked out very well indeed. The room rate was very reasonable, much lower than most places in HK, and the room was big enough for us all, with the kids sleeping on the carpeted floor on extra sheets. We didn't pay for breakfast at the hotel, instead getting sandwiches and cakes from the Homburg Cake Shop just across the road each morning and drinks from the 7/11 nearby. So for a budget traveller who still wants a decent hotel the Island Pacific is perfect. Pros: + compact room but good use of space + good buffet lunch for HK$128/adult (and dinner for HK$268 with 32% off with discount voucher, but we only had the lunch). Both prices +10% tax. + concierge very helpful, I needed to find a store stocking a specific product and within 10 minutes they provided me a list. + fridge in-room, contained minibar items but there was room for some of our own food + Good \"Homburg\" Cake Shop in the side-street across the road. Cons: - pool is cold, the kids didn't want to use it - small exercise room, only 1 of the 2 treadmills was working - internet is not free (there may be a single freely accessible Mac in the bar area but we didn't enquire about it) - reception staff wore face masks due to H1N1/Swine Fever. While I can understand the medical reasons for this, it made it a little hard to understand their speech. Plus, most other staff didn't wear masks, e.g. restaurant staff. The lift buttons were also sterilised hourly which seems overkill, but if you're a health-freak you might like that.

It is not high end, and you should not go in expecting it to be. However our experience was that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel, and it delivers on all points for the price we are paying. Was it worth it (value for money)? Absolutely. But will want to know a few things. Here's what we (my wife & daughter) thought was most noticeable about the hotel: The hotel: quite nice, and not grand. Clean, maintained, and comfortably functional. Not a large hotel, but has all the amenities you would want. The service: from the moment we arrived, friendly, very helpful (particularly the concierge), accommodating, prompt, and brilliantly efficient. Everything we requested--from an harbour view to a larger bed to help with the room safe to providing new pillows--was taken care of immediately and with no hesitation. The room: Smallish but definitely comfortable. Normal sized bathroom with tub. Spectacular view on harbor side. Yes, the rooms are definitely starting to show a little wear around the edges, but nothing that really affects the quality of your stay (unless slight wall abrasions or minor carpet stains affect the quality of your stay). Here's what we didn't expect: The location: let's be honest, this hotel is square in the middle of a working-class neighbourhood. You walk out the hotel and you are in the thick of an older, residential neighbourhood. No glitz, no glamour, just fruit sellers, noodle shops, and many trading shops, the majority which sell dried sea whatever (the Chinese have a penchant for clustering a particular commodity into an area). Local restaurants sell cheap, tasty food. Just be prepared for local, not touristy. Please understand, for me being in the thick of working HK is not a bad thing; it is the real deal HK. If you'd like to be just out of the tourist area, this is a good location. It's right on the tram line, so it can take you to the MTR and the center easily. However, we did find that after a long day of traveling, it always felt like an extra effort to get back to the hotel.

Again in HK most normal hotels you will find twin beds more common than Doubles, Queen and Kingsize, but the hotel does offer the latter as well, just make sure you put it down as a preference. Due to the length of stay, we decided to pay the little extra and pay for the \"superior room\" supposedly a larger room and a partial harbour view; however we found ourselves on the 10th floor in the smallest room facing the back of the hotel over looking the mainly residential western district. Because of this we called up reception and they were happy to offer an upgrade; we were moved to the executive floor (28) and had or partial harbour view and a bit bigger room (note most rooms in HK hotels do tend to be on the small side compared to their european counterparts). Check in staff were friendly, although due to the Swine Flu outbreak, they were all wearing face masks, and upon check in our temperature was checked, and our passport details taken. The hotel is in a nice area, less touristy and had a more local feel to the place, every morning it was busy with people moving about the street, one street directly behind (and paralled to) the hotel there is a nice little bakery that sold a selection of cakes, I became quite fond of the egg tarts and pineapple sugar butter buns. However around the area there are a lot of fish stalls as mention prefiously, and a lot of items are placed on the street; it gives a lovely insight to the place, but if you don't like seeing such things daily, this area may not be for you. On the road infront of the Hotel (Connaught Rd West I believe), if you wal towards western market you will come across a small little local cafe, around 5-10 min walk, which made a change from our normal touristy routine. FInally transport, despite being a little way out from the hustle and bustle HK's transport infrastructure really does shine, I prefered taking the bus to central and then the MTR (underground) or ferry from there. If you want to get to the main business district/shopping area in central try and get the bus numbers 1, 5, 10 and 18 - costing around $3.4- to get to central; they are the cheapest and are very regular (the 3 digit buses tend to be more expensive). I would definitely advise getting an Octopus card no matter how short the stay as the majority of the money paid for the card will be refunded (you pay a $50 deposit when you get the card). If you are in need of any help find a tourist information centre or ask a local, overall we found the friendliest people to be around the Kowloon Walled City (north Kowloon). make no mistake about it HK is a tourist hot spot, and if you spend most of your time in the centres you will pay for it, try go exploring and go to some lesser explored places and you will discover some delightful places and save the pennies :)", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "geneva", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel, near central location, but don't expect more than you pay for\u201d", "Author": "mdang1986", "ReviewID": "UR32095396", "Content": "The hotel was good.

To be fair, the space was just about manageable and not unbearably tiny. However, we only stayed for two nights. It\u2019s possible that a longer stay would\u2019ve felt more cramped. We had two large pieces of luggage, and we struggled to find a place for them. If you are travelling light though, this won\u2019t be a problem. After using the shower, we noticed that the bath had difficulty draining. It\u2019s kinda gross to stand in five inches of dirty water whilst showering. We informed the staff about this, but I\u2019m not sure whether they did something about it or not. The next day the drain was more or less the same. The mini-bar prices! This we took as a joke. A large bottle of Evian water (1 liter) was HKG $68! If you\u2019re a light sleeper, please be aware that you can hear the plumbing from the other rooms. Even though we heard the water pipes all night, we were too jetlagged for it to bother us. Now for the good points. I love it when hotels have pillow menus. We really don\u2019t like down filled pillows, so we requested harder Tempur-like ones. It\u2019s nice to be able to get pillows that are more or less like the ones you\u2019re used to at home. I really liked where the air conditioning vents were positioned. In most hotels, they\u2019re situated in a way that they blow almost right over your face when you lie down on the bed, and I find that too breezy for comfort. These vents dispersed cold air evenly over the whole room. It was a nice touch to have an ironing board and an iron in the room, without having to request housekeeping to bring you one and then waiting for it. Good, powerful hairdryer. Nice iPod dock, the bellboys were lovely, our check-in and check-out were quick, efficient, and trouble-free. When we checked out, we took the hotel shuttle to the ifc.

I booked through Hotels.com and secured a nightly rate of just under US$100 (all inclusive). This modern high-rise hotel is located in the western part of Hong Kong Island in the Western Market area of Sheung Wan. The Macau Ferry Terminal is an easy ten minute walk from the hotel, the Sheung Wan MTR Station an additional five minutes, and the Airport Express Station just ten minutes from the hotel by taxi. There is tram service on Des Voeux Road with the closest tram stop just one block from the hotel. As mentioned in other reviews, the Island Pacific Hotel is located in the heart of the dried seafood market area. Others have mentioned the smell of dried seafood as strong and offensive. I really didn\u2019t find the smell to be that strong unless walking directly in front of the many dried seafood shops and I didn\u2019t really even notice the smell in and around the hotel. The smell certainly would not deter me from staying at this hotel in the future. Upon arrival at the hotel on my first day in Hong Kong, I was warmly greeted by the bell staff and the front office staff. My check-in was handled efficiently and I was assigned a room on the 20th floor. As mentioned in other reviews, the room was fairly small and narrow. However, the high ceiling and floor to ceiling windows gave the room a more spacious feel. My room happened to be a corner room that offered a partial view of Victoria Harbor and the Tsing Ma Bridge along with views west towards Kennedy Town. There was a small desk and chair placed next to the windows. The room was \u201ctired looking\u201d with dated furniture, carpet, and drapes. The small \u201ctube\u201d TV was located on a shelf next to the closet to the side of the bed. Not the best location for comfortable viewing. It would be nice to have a large flat screen TV mounted on the wall in front of the bed. My room had two single beds. With both beds, there was little room to walk between the ends of the beds and the wall and also between one of the beds and the closet. The room had a small refrigerator (with mini-bar items), a hot water pot, an iron and board, and a small safe. The bathroom was of average size with a tub / shower combination. A phone was mounted on the wall behind the toilet. The hotel provided a nice array of toiletries, although nothing special. A nice feature of the room was that a speaker for audio from the TV was mounted in the bathroom so you could listen to whatever was showing on the TV. Except for some mold around the caulking of the tub and some dust around the corners of the room, overall, the room was clean. The bed was comfortable and the linens were clean. I did not try the hotel restaurant, but one morning I stopped to take a look at the breakfast buffet which I found quite extensive. At approximately US$20 this was more than I wished to spend for breakfast. There is a small bar on the lobby level of the hotel that offers limited views over the harbor. There is a 7-11 market across the street, a wonderful bakery across from the 7-11 along with a Watsons and Merrills for health care products, and a Caf\u00e9-De Coral half a block past the 7-11 that offered cheap and tasty meals. The hotel offers an \u201cExecutive Level\u201d on the top four floors of the hotel. I did not see any of the rooms on these floors but I was graciously allowed to take a walk through the Executive Level Lounge which looked quite comfortable and offered nice views of both Victoria Harbor and the surrounding area. In the lounge, there were three computers for use by guests in addition to other reading material and refreshments. A lounge hostess was available to assist with any guest needs or business needs. The hotel offers complimentary half hourly shuttle service, on a first come first served basis, to a few set locations in the area, including the Airport Express / International Finance Center. In my opinion, the most redeeming quality of this hotel is its staff, especially the housekeeping and bell / concierge staff. In all of my contacts with them I was always greeted with a smile and a willingness to do whatever they could to answer my question(s) or make my stay more comfortable. For a sub US$100 per night room rate, I would not hesitate to stay again at the Island Pacific.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cPretty Decent\u201d", "Author": "mohammedyeo1981", "ReviewID": "UR28988462", "Content": "Stayed here for a month. very decent place with good rooms, excellent view and helpful service.

And by using the tram you can mitigate the inconvenience of the subway station distance. The service is good, and the room is a fair size in Asian standard. The hotel is located on the tram line. It is the cheapest form of transportation in HK. For 2$ HK, you can travel from one end to the other. Most of your shopping/site seeing (other than Kowloon, the Peak, Ocean Park, Stanley Market) can be accessed by the tram. It is a bit slower. It'll take about 35 min to get to the other side (Sogo in Causeway Bay). Hong Kong is very small. It is a short walk from the ferry to the tram line. You can get to Kowloon for 2.6$HK from the ferries. The hotel provides a shuttle to the IFC Mall where the HK Express Station and subway station is also located. When you arrive in HK, you should take the HK Express Train to this station. It is 24 min and you can pay when you leave the train, so don't line up at the airport side. Then take a taxi to the hotel. It is about 35$HK. When you leave, you can take the hotel shuttle back to this station.

The trams are a little slower, but very easy to use (just pay $2 on the way off) and since the tram line is just a single line very easy to get your bearings on. A taxi from the hotel into the centre of the city is about $25 (under 2.50 GB Pounds). Don't let the fact the hotel isn't right in the centre put you off at all. The area around it is known for its dried sea food. It is a little smelly when you walk past the shops, but then if that bothers you then stay in America or wherever. We've travelled a fair bit in Asia and think that apart from the traffic fumes sometimes, Hong Kong is a pretty clean city and the area around the hotel is no exception. Obviously, some people turn their noses up at some of the sights in Asia (well, anywhere outside the US) but again, they should stay at home. This is a pretty clean area. One complaint we did have was that we were booked into a triple room, and they gave us a double with a third bed squeezed in up against the bedside table. We complained that it wasn't a triple room, and they moved us to an executive room on the top (29th) floor. This also was only really a double, but even with a third bed taking the place of the sofa was plenty big enough and we were satisfied with it. They also gave us a complementary breakfast each for our trouble. The normal rooms were smallish, but the executive room was fine, don't know what the price difference is. How long do you spend in the room anyway? The hotel in general was fine. Clean, friendly, staff not too over the top in your face falling at your feet trying to help you (again, some people like that, we find it nauseating). Apart from the rooms not really being triples, we had no complaints at all and would recommend this hotel completely. Oh, never went to the bar so didn't see most of the prices, but cans of coke were $36 compared to $5 in the shop next door, but that probably compares to other hotels around. Our top tip for Hong Kong is to get an Octopus Card to pay on the transport, saves queuing or keeping change for the trams and buses.

The room was quite a good size compared with some I have stayed in before, particularly in London, and we had a corner room with two great views. As an extra bonus you get to stay in a more traditional area of the island and see a little of more old fashioned HK life.

However, this did not mar the stay, and overall this was a great hotel serving good food and excellent value, particularly recommended if you are staying a little longer in HK.

Island Pacific is actually within a 10-min walk from Sheung Wan MTR station. From the MTR station, you are only 2 minutes away from the central business district, Central, and about 8 minutes away from the shopping district, Causeway Bay. If you know how to take the tram, that's even better. The tram charges a flat rate of HKD2 (approx. a quarter) no matter of the distance you travel. There is a tram stop about 100 metres from the entrance of the hotel. While the tram is slower than the MRT, you will still get to Central in approximately 10 minutes and Causeway Bay in approximately 20 minutes, depending on the time of the day. The conceirge staff are extremely helpful and courteous. The supervisor is especially helpful - I was waiting impatiently for my airport coach to come by where he quickly helped to call up the company and enquire about the status of the coach which was already 20 minutes late. Front desk staff are also professional and amiable. I was given a free upgrade promptly when they had some problems with my Asia Miles mileage accrual (supposed to be able to accrue mileage by staying at this hotel but due to some miscommunications, they were unable to do so). The business centre is managed by a staff during operating hours and she was very helpful and approachable. There were two computers with high-speed internet connection available and printing charges are low compared to other hotels of the same category. Light snacks and drinks are provided at the business centre too. Rooms are clean and well-maintained. While the size of the room is not large (but this is across the board in Hong Kong where land prices are ridiculously high), it is well-decorated and furnished. Basically, the rooms are cosy and chic-looking. Internet connection is also available in every room. The lobby lounge is very cosy and is a good place to have casual business discussion with your partners. As the hotel does not cater to a lot of tour groups, you can be assured that you won't be affected by noisy tour groups while you are having your business discussion at the lobby lounge.

We got the coach from the airport which was supplied by Vigor which only took just over 35 mins and was a decent journey this was booked through Octopus travel. We also booked other trips with them as i found them excellant value for money compared with other websites. Check in was nice and easy and the hotel staff were very pleasant. Our room was lovely and clean, small but who needs a large room when your going to spend most of the time exploring what Hong Kong has to offer and also a very impressive view of the harbour. Once outside the hotel you were in the seafood area of Hong Kong which you could instantly tell because the smell of fish was pretty strong. The cheapest way to travel anywhere was probably by tram which was basically a 2 minute walk in either direction at the rear of the hotel in des voeux road west. The tram only cost 2HKD per journey and you could quite happily travel up and down the length of Hong Kong island. It did however get very busy and we very often were crushed in during these times. The nearest MTR station is Sheung Wan station which is probably a 10-15 min walk away. We walked this a couple of times however during the day it is very hot and humid so its probably better to get the tram to Central. The MTR is an excellant way of travelling round and we bought tourist passes to get us about. Its much more spacious than the London underground and very tourist friendly. There is also a hotel courtesy bus that goes at various times throughout the day until 7pm and drops you off in Central.

The area is full of dried fish shops but the smell is not that strong unless you walk all the way next to the shops to the nearest MTR station. Its only 15 mins walk to the nearest station, or you can take the bus (there are plenty of them) which will take you to the nearest MTR station within less than 5 mins and will only cost you HK$3.80 about 25p. I advice that you buy an Octopus Card from the airport or at any MTR station, its the best and easiest way to pay for buses and underground fares, its similar to the Oyster card here in London but even better you can use it as a payment card which is widely accepted in shops and even in McDonalds, KFC's and more etc..

The room was cleaned every day and the bed sheets were replaced every day as well but the carpets looked rather old and need some freshening.
