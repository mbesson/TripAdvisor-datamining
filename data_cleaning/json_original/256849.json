{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great location; lacking service  Bondi Beach is a spectacular place, and Ravesi's clearly has the monopoly on expensive (i.e. small but pricey) hotels. The rooms are spacious and the views are lovely, but this IS NOT a boutique hotel. The service was atrocious. We depleted the 6 Kleenex in a box on our first night, and used toilet tissue instead for the remainder of our stay. After spending 5 nights ($2000) we were denied entry to their restaurant because of a Bar Mitvah that had been booked at the venue - and there was little (to no) effort to accommodate us. I have stayed at Boutique hotels in Miami, London, Toronto, Paris, Rome - and I have never received such poor service as that provided at Ravesi's in Bondi. I travel to Sydney frequently, and I will stay at the Swiss Grand next time.", "Date": "Dec 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR763325091", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SkanesToronto"}, {"Content": "very poor I would avoid this place if i were you. The website makes it look cool and relaxed, somewhere to unwind. You are in reality hit with an awful smell as you enter this place. Some bright spark kitted the place out in a horribe looking carpet. This wouldn't have been too much of a problem until half of Bondi decided this is where they will go to get pissed. Hence the carpet is doused with beer everynight. Then when you meet the surly assistants at the reception, you know you are not in for much fun.The rooms aren't too bad at first glance, if a little shaby around the edges. However if you are planning to get away for the weekend and relax dont come here. The music from the awful bar at the lobby takes centre stage and you are subjected to the noise of the bass from the speakers till around 1.30am. Once this cuts out the yobs making their way home will make sure you enjoy their loud signing too.Go there if you are on the piss for the w.end, if you are remotely looking for something nicer than your own bedroom and to chill out...avoid it.

This place has stepped up its game!! Almost passed on this gem due to the so-so reviews on this website but the weakening Aussie dollar encouraged us to take a gamble, and I'm so glad we did!!! The We booked a side-view room for about $160 US per night ($240 AUS) from November 25-28, 2008, on www.wotif.com. The whole experience was fantastic from check-in to check-out. We got here a tad early and were cheerfully allowed into our room. The room was enormous, by boutique hotel standards anyway, well-appointed, and had with balconies and a side- view of the beach and complimentary bottles of Voss water. The bed linens were pristine white and the furniture dark wood. The bathroom was sparkling white and included a tub (the longest hotel bathroom tub I have ever seen). The bathroom was pretty simple and won't win any design awards but anyone who faults it is just being fussy. Plus, bonus points for a floor so clean that you can eat off of it. The room was perfect. The hotel is literally across the street from Bondi Beach and very easy to access from central Sydney or the aiprot - just take the subway to Bondi Junction and then either the 380, 381, or 333 buses - the buses stop right by the hotel. The only con, I guess, is the noise - the hotel contains a lively bar and restaurant and is facing a busy street, so if you need pin-drop silence to sleep you might be annoyed. We didn't mind it at all, though - it's a small price to pay for being On. The. Beach. Plus, when it's quieter, you can actually hear the waves. The rotating cast of young front desk clerks were uniformly friendly without overdoing it and extremely helpful (shout-out to the adorable night clerk who went out of his way to help us). No attitude to be seen anywhere. The first night, we ate at a little Greek restaurant on Campbell parade called Nikos that served the best spaghetti with clams I have ever had in my entire life. Incredible. The second night, we headed out to the Flying Squirrel tapas bar a little further out - also excellent. The final night, we splurged at Ravesi's restaurant, which was outstanding - we booked beforehand and were given the best table ( corner, facing the ocean) and faultless service. We were a little unlucky with the weather during our stay on Bondi, but still managed to have a great time, probably because we stayed at Ravesi's.", "Date": "Nov 29, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR602037472", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PT1976"}, {"Content": "chic boutique Hotel by amazing Bondi beach Having been told Ravesi's had undergone a major refurb we booked 2 nights in a slpit level room for 2 adults  2 children.We were pleasantly surpised by the size of the room - an open terrace and lounge area included - the decor is funky and included a KING size bed and it was remarkably quiet, given we are on top of one of the busiest bars/restaurants in the area.

You cannot possibly find a noisier 5 STAR HOTEL anywhere in the world than Ravesi. Forget about the picture of tranquillity on Ravesi's website - it simply does not exist! The level of noise that you experience at all hours of the day and night is simply shocking! Since the hotel is located at the corner of two very busy roads, you would think that the windows ought to have been double glazed. Well, THINK AGAIN!Apart from the noise factor, you will also have to deal with a bunch of very unfriendly client facing staff. They are definitely not there to provide any service. More to the point, they are there to look the part but even that, they don't do very well. Overall an extremely disappointing experience and an expensive mistake - NEVER AGAIN.

The bar has a contemporary feel to it. The bar was very busy; standing only and very noisey. There was an overall lack of friendly atmosphere. I asked for a bottle of champagne to celebrate my arrival and was stunned that the young barman said I was too drunk to serve. I hadn't even had a drink and couldn't figure out why he was saying this. I can only put it down to my strong Glasgow accent and he didn't understand me!! Anyway, he asked the doorman to ask me to leave - my friends asking him to understand I was not drunk. I asked to speak to the doorman alone and after seconds of talking to him he said 'your not drunk', he then spoke to the barman and I was served.

We`thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The hotel staff were pleasant and accommodating and prepared our room for us quicker than expected.The room itself was a split level room with a view of the beach. It was tastefully furnished (whoever said Ikea obviously doesn't shop there as the furniture is high quality bespoke fitted units) and very large with its own living space and balcony. By contrast with many other hotels in Australia they also offer free wifi access which was a great bonus.It is clear that the refurbishment was done a few years ago but the room still had a quality feel to it (for example the bath suite was Villeroy  Boch) and the price charged was not excessive compared to other hotels that we stayed in.The restaurant is lively with good food and service and the bar is always packed.

What little I did get, though, was of such a surly nature it was laughable. This was true of everyone in the place, from the desk manager to the bartenders (there is a very popular bar in the hotel).Then there was the room. Whoever shot it for the magazines is a genius: the pics I had seen were very attractive. The furnishings, while modern, were of an Ikea-type quality; carpets were soiled; and the bathroom was NOT remodeled at all - rusted tub, molded tiles, etc. Pillows and blankets were old, and not down. If Ravesi's were charging, say, A$125 per night, these would all be acceptable issues, and you could say to yourself it was a modest, unsophisticated operation.
