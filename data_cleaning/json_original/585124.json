{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Good Value but the pool ants are creepy I stayed there in April and the rooms were lovely. The family suite was great sleeps 3 people great or two singels and a couple are fine. The staff was very nice. The pool was pretty but had an ant problem that was annoying. You are close to everything, the clubs are great. Some areas of the public beaches are a bit too public but a great place to stay and enjoy the night life.", "Date": "Jun 25, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR155454758", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "myllidixon"}, {"Content": "Not what it says it is This is not a Villa its a 2 star hotel with detached bungalows around a central pool. There is not the privacy that you would expect from a private villa, for example if you swam in the pool naked other guests would see you whereas in a private Villa you have the run of the place.Also its not in Seminyak, its in Kerobokan.People may enjoy their stay here but don't be misled by the advertising and name.", "Date": "Jun 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR351050375", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "KetutSeminyak"}, {"Content": "value for money       open air bathroom", "Date": "Apr 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR754243513", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "aya2007"}, {"Content": "Cheap, but left lots to be desired We spent 1 week in a two bedroom family pavilion. My parents stayed in a one bedroom suite (identical to bottom floor of two bedroom suite). The gardens were lovely, but the villas seemed fairly run down and dirty. The bedrooms on the main floor have a huge window that looks at a dirty 10 foot wall. There is a seperate room for the bathroom and kitchen. The bathroom area is open air (walls but no roof), but the kitchen area is roofed. The toilet was leaky and the bathroom was very smelly. The open air shower was very nice though. The kitchen felt really dirty (partially because it is attached to a smelly bathroom). There were lots of cockroaches in this area in the evenings.  The second bedroom was located upstairs, but there is an external staircase. It was basicly a second detached unit. This would be ok for a family with older children, but was difficult for us (we have a 1 and 3 year old). We went out and bought a baby moniter which fixed this problem. There were some general maintanance problems with the rooms. Our parents had to change rooms because the air conditioner didn't work. Our toilet had some problems. Our front door had to be locked to remain closed. The pool was very deep (no shallow end). We were glod to have brought a baby lifejacket and float toys.The staff were nice. We requested a baby cot and highchair be in our room and it was supplied. There were not any high chairs in the restaurant. There is internet access (very slow thought).15 minute walk to the beach. The beach is a little scruffy in this area. Lots of good restaurants in the area. A really great bakery two buildings away. Restaurant accross the road was great. Venue @ the moon (next door) was great and cheap (also had a kids menu) Hope that helps.", "Date": "Mar 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR757707351", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "CanadianMagnolia"}, {"Content": "Loved the Putu Serenity My family stayed at Putu Bali Villa  Spa last November after thoroughly researching all Villas within walking distance to the great restaurants in Seminyak... and we found the Putu to be a peaceful world away from the touristy Kuta.We travelled with our 2 children (3  7 years) and wanted 2 rooms. The 2 story family pavillion was great! (although separate outside entries to bedrooms were awkward with small children). The ground level had Queen Bedroom, Kitchen, outdoor Bathroom with HUGE bath  fantastic shower. Upstairs was second Queen bedroom with indoor bathroom (no bath), and very relaxing balcony. The rooms were made up beautifully every day with fresh quality linen  fragrant frangipani flowers.The pool, although a shared pool, felt like it belonged to us. It was rare to see anyone else and the serenity was bliss! One tip for parents with small children... bring blow up pool floats, as the pool was too deep to stand with children.The gardens at the Putu were LUSH  well cared for (bring citronella candles/incense/spray as night time mosquitos were bothersome without these). The staff in ALL AREAS were absolutely FANTASTIC! It was certainly a home away from home. The location was perfect for us... walking distance to La Lucciola, The Hu'u, The Living Room, Bebek Bali  many, many other excellent restaurants (too many to try in one trip!). Bodyworks Day Spa is also within walking distance. The beach is walkable, but we preferred the pool. Tip: Hu'u = Great food + Amazing pool... arrive early, the kids loved this place! Was pricey... but worth every cent :) Eats Street  boutique shopping were only a short taxi ride away (5000 Rupiah = $0.80 approx) We can't wait to return! Perfect family holiday in every way. Certainly a well kept little secret... ssh!", "Date": "Feb 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR443625825", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "MsSP"}, {"Content": "Wonderful time in Bali The Putu bali Villa and Spa is a great place to stay. Very friendly staff and nice quite location.Don't bother with the included breakfast - there's so many cheap places within walking ditance of the hotel and it's great to pretty much eat food cooked by local mumsThe rooms are big and clean, the kitchen is function - why would you cook when great food is so cheap - and the outdoor shower is great. They have the biggest baths i have ever see - reckon you could fit 10 people in them no problem!For the price I don't think you can do any better.
