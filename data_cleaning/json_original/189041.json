Housekeepers made quite a racket as they went about their business.No chance of a lie in. Had evening meal on first night..a carvery. Decent enough for standard of hotel. However breakfast was a let down. It was the usual english breakfast.. buffett style. Not sure how long the food had been kept in the food warmers. Tea as has been mentioned in other reviews was not worth drinking. Why? Because it came out of an urn so has been stewing rather than brewing for I don't know how long. Also we were given a table where the tablecoth was stained from the previous occupants and were also sat directly in line of the air conditioning so breakfast went cold rather quickly.

We were given 1 extra pillow and 1 extra towel, 2 in total!! That evening, we had an evening meal in the restaurant, upon check in we were told we had to order by 21.30pm, I was at the entrance to the restaurant for 21.10pm, an older female member of staff shouted \"YES\" at me, I explained that we had an evening meal booked and she replied they were closing, I stated that we were told, they werent supposed to stop serving (last orders) until 21.30. The female member of staff (who again spoke with a foreign accent) pointed over at a table as she walked in the opposite direction.She was very rude!!! On our first morning, we were woken up by the housing keeping staff, unfortunately we were in Room 428 and their store room was directly opposite, there are exceptionally loud, laughing and messing about at approximately 07.45am!! Brilliant wake up call, no need to set your alarm! The WORSE thing to happen to me was; I ended up rushing for our train home on Valentines day and left my diamonte earrings (a gift from a friend in Australia) and swarovski crystal necklace (A Christmas gift from my husband) in a glass on the bathroom sink.

I rang the hotel immediately and was eventually put through to a foreign speaking female on reception, who told me to ring back in the afternoon, this was at 13.30, we left the hotel at 13.15. I rang back 3 times and eventually left my mobile number. One of the managers Mrs Mcdowel rang back to say nothing had been left!!!!!!!! As I have no proof to who had my jewellery I cannot go around making accusations, however when speaking with Mrs Mcdowel, she stated that my husband and I were accusing her staff of stealing, which we never did, although I know where I left my jewellery and now they are saying nothing was there!!!!

We arrived at the hotel and were allocated a room by an Irish lady at reception who then handed us two vouchers for dinner at the hotel and she advised us that they had to be used on our first night at the hotel . I advised her that we had not been told about the vouchers and had booked a meal at a restaurant close to the theatre for the first night .I then asked could we use them the following night to be met with a brusk \"No they can only be used on the first night , it is not flexible\" I asked what difference it made if we used them the first or second night and she replied \"it is not flexible, they have to be used on your first night\" ................ I thought great customer care and we haven't even got to the room. I didn't have time to argue about it as we were on a tight schedule to get to the theatre but I should have read the signs and turned around and found another hotel , I really should have but unfortunately I had pre-paid. The room could only be described as pokey, dated and smelling of stale cigarettes ..........but we just didn't have the time to do anything but drop our bags and set off to the theatre .I was reluctant to contact reception in view of the treatment we had previously been subject to. We opened the window to freshen up the room and left.On our return we had an opportunity to have a good look at the room and it left a lot to be desired , the tiles around the shower were mouldy (see photo), the rail rusty (Photo) , the vent full of dust and dirt (photo), the dust was hanging off the top of the bathroom door(Photo) and the shower curtain discoloured. The bed was provided with only one pillow and on trying to get to bed we were faced with the dilema of being stifled in the room with the window closed or opening the window and being hit by the traffic noise . We spent two very uncomfortabe and sleepless nights at the hotel . Breakfast...................what can I say................. it looked like we were back in a holiday camp in the 1950's ............ queuing for food , machines for coffee or tea , cold and soggy toast......we ended up going round the corner to one of the little French Cafes for breakfast .Breakfast in the hotel was the stuff of our worst nightmares and in a funny way we were glad we couldn't use the vouchers in the hotel restaurant and the second night we went to a fabulous little French restaurant called Denise's just around the corner in Southampton Row a two minutes walk away. What a difference .................. fabulous food and really great, friendly service , the Dover Sole was superb and I understand from the same fishmonger who supplies Buckingham Palace no less. On our return to the hotel on the second night we received a phone call telling us not to use the kettle to make tea as the power socket was defective!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! but we had already been there for two days........................ it brought to mind the carry on films with Kenneth Williams out in the corridor uttering those immortal words \"Frying Tonight\" Housekeeping woke us very early the first morning with their loud chattering in the hallway , someone needs to tell them to be quiet as people are likely to be still asleep at 7:30am .The second morning we were awoken by banging from the room next door and when we left to go out for breakfast there was a tradesman\\decorator working on the bedroom next door.Again did nobody think about the fee-paying guests in the room next door , in our opinion a total lack of consideration.

We asked for our heating to be turned off but had to ask twice and it was still too hot.The walls are very thin and it sounded as though next door were actually having a bath in our bathroom. You could hear every little noise. The hotel was clean and the bathroom was very clean although the towels were old and didnt smell very fresh. There was no information whatsoever in the room regarding hotel facilities, not even the number to dial for reception. The breakfast experience was a bit of a nightmare, there was never any tables and you had to look around for one they were never cleared very quickly. The toast was cold and soggy. The hot breakfast looked a bit tired. There were never any saucers or teaspoons. It was total chaos in the mornings. On the whole however the hotel was adequate for our needs as we only slept here and had our breakfast as we were out all day and only returned to sleep. The best thing about it was the proximity to Euston station and the tube.

I agree with the post where this \"3 star hotel\" is referred to as a homeless shelter. It certainly isn't a hotel! I have stayed in 3 star hotels before and as a minimum you expect a clean but more basic room than higher ratings but cleanliness being the key! We booked our trip last minute and were told it was a basic hotel but clean and had nice breakfast so we thought we would chance it. We have stayed in 3* hotels before Jurys inn's and Travelodges and they have all been clean. On arrival we were giving the most pokey and filthy room I have ever seen. We immediately complained that we weren't happy and were moved to another room that was being cleaned. Again it looked filthy but as we were told it was being cleaned we thought we would see afterwards. We phoned our travel agent straight away and said how dirty it was and could we pay to change hotels as we weren't happy. The operator we booked with said because it was after 12 we checked in we would have to pay that night (despite check in being 2pm and it was a complaint on hygiene!) We paid extra to stay at the Thistle 3 Star Bloomsbury park the 2nd night as we knew it would have just completely ruined our trip. Once we got into our new room it was filthy, shabby and what would be best described as a hostel. There were damp patches, dirt, graffiti on the furniture and just horrible! It looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1950s. Everything felt grimey. I ran my finger across the window sill and coated with thick dust and grit. Lovely! Breakfast the next morning was quite possibly the worst food I have ever seen and I am actually tempted to alert the health inspectors. The waiter sat us down to a filthy table with stains all over the table cloth so we moved. When we attempted to pour a glass of orange juice it took many attempts to find a clean glass without foot stuck to them. Same with the plates. food embedded on every plate I picked up. Vile! This was before seeing what they called the food! Yellow liquid with fish floating in... looked like a washing up bowl in a school dining hall. The bacon was fatty and under cooked. There were dirty plates and glasses strewn across the \"buffet\" area. I couldn't bear to put any of that in my mouth. I picked up a soggy piece of toast and that was enough to send us to Starbucks down the road! We promptly checked out and filled in a complaint form. The lobby is not what I would describe as nice at all... not welcoming, suitcases all over the floor as no baggage area for left luggage and a eerie atmosphere where we felt like it was trapped in another time zone. Not to mention the big stick with the key which was lethal looking. I am being honest in writing this review as I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake as us and having to pay out more money for another hotel to escape this horror. If you want a disgusting hovel of a place to rest your head in scratchy sheets and rock hard towels this is the place for you!!! If on the other hand you have an ounce of respect for your health and have cleanliness as a priority check in at the 3 Star (yes same star rating.... God knows how!) Thistle Bloomsbury Park around the corner and it will feel like heaven! Or The Hilton Doubtletree (4 star) in Bloomsbury which is highly recommended!

I got a single room on the 7th floor and when I checked in, the lobby was as to be expected. But I was genuinely shocked at how spartan and basic the 7th floor hall and my room were. The room was clean as advertised but the decor and ambience are absolutely appalling. I could only compare it to an inner city government rooming house for homeless people or similar. The walls were institutional off-white and the furniture, carpet and minimal decor were as basic and unattractive as could be imagined. The 7th floor has it's own elevator which is an old fashioned style which includes a large metal swinging door which slams shut loudly every time you enter the elevator. The elevator button had to be pressed twice every time since the inner folding door partly closes and then retracts back open every single time. The plain white walls around the elevator on the 7th floor are all graffittied and marked with pencil and it seems to have been that way for a long time.

This hotel has gotta be one of the worst hotels/places i've stayed at in a long time. On arrival we went to check in and the loby smelt of urine. (My mum said it was fish!) After speaking very slowly to the receptionist (who was forgien) we were given a key to our room, which was a key on a long metal pole thing and told that everytime we go out we must leave it with the reception staff. (I felt like I was twelve years old handing my key back to my mum as I couldn't be trusted). We eventually got to our room which was small with two single beds in it. We asked what my daughter would sleep on and were given this fold down bed that was solid. The lovely bed came with a horrible itchy blanket which my daughter refused to sleep on, we asked if they could take it out and was advised that they couldnt due to health and safety so we were stuck with another bed in a very small room. The room itself was pretty dated, there was no air con or double glazing which was a nightmare as the hotel itself was very hot and when you leave the windows open at night you hear the bottle bins getting emptied which then wakes you up. There is a seperate toilet from the shower and sink which was quite weird, the wallpaper was ripped and black stains on the ceiling in the bathroom along with stains on the carpets and holes in the sheets! When we tried to speak to the staff about it they struggled gto understand us (our accents are not that bad!!) which made it even worse so in the end we just gave up and stayed out from about 10am until really late at night. The breakfast was a complete eye opener! It was a self service buffet style which in most hotels is fine. They had fish that to me looked like scrambled eggs due to the bubbly grease, they even cook the toast which is soggy and teh rest of the food at breakfast time is just awfull. If you can get past the chewyness of the toast and stick to cereal then you'll be fine! The location of the hotel is fab but that's the only fab thing about it. I would love to say that the staff are great, but to be honest they were not, dunno if it was the accent (even tho I have no problem anywhere else in the world speaking to people) the food is disgusting although the drink prices are good!

The staff was friendly, helpful, and efficient. Knowing about the rooms ahead of time was helpful. Ammenties were small bars of soap, packets containing tea, coffee, sugar and small packets of milk. Being forewarned, I took shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and shower gel. The only alarm available was a wake-up call. It was always at the time requested. The room was clean, although small (single room). The bathroom was also quite small. It might have felt a bit claustrophobic for a larger person. The tub was very narrow and the curtain kept sticking to me as I showered. The bed was a twin, but very comfortable. True, the tv didn't have a lot of variety, but I wasn't there to watch television. I loved being able to keep the windows open. As I walked around London, I smelled some of the sour odors mentioned in some reviews, but never at the hotel. Wifi was spotty. I could access in the lobby and once in a while in the room. The Continental breakfast was always the same, but plentiful for me. There were 4-5 choices of cold cereal, orange and grapefruit sections, buns, toast, 3 juices, milk, coffee, and tea. Those with the English plan ate in the first dining area and had many more choices. Typically eating around 8-8:20, there was never a line. After than there could be long ones. The location of this hotel is perfect! It is within walking distance to Russell Square, The British Museum, the Tube, pubs, restaurants, Leicester Square, Covent Garden, Piccadilly Circus, theatres and more. If you're not a walker, it is convenient to hop on a double decker bus, or the Tube. The Night and Day pub/cafe, located in the Imperial Hotel (attached to the President) stays open late for a light meal, a pint, or other drinks. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at this hotel.

The room was spacious, clean and everything worked fine. We had no problems with any aspect of the room. The bathroom had adequate space for all your bathroom needs which we found not 3 star rooms have. Location was brilliant only a minute walk to Russell Square station ( great line for many of London's attractions ), Tesco supermarket and a post office. Cons: None of these cons affected our stay, however it would have been nice if these were changed. No Mini fridge, many other 3 star hotels had a mini fridge to hold a few drinks and snacks. Buffet Breakfast was included and was nice but there wasn't as wide a range as many of our other hotels had. Toast, Jam, Rolls and Cereal only.

So when I recently had to stay at the President's Hotel for a family event, I was a bit nervous that I would have issues with the room. I was actually pleasantly surprised. So here's the real picture: The President is definitely on the older side, and yes, a bit shabby. The lobby is a bit sad looking and constantly smells of cigarette smoke, and the some of the receptionists were a bit rude. Also, the wireless internet worked only in some areas - for example, in my room I had to sit on the floor near the front door to have any chance of reception, and even in parts of the lobby you couldn't quite get it. Now, on to the room itself: the design is a bit old fashioned and basic - nothing to write home about. However, the room we stayed in was perfectly clean and in good condition - I didn't get any of the \"icky\" feeling I get in some hotel rooms. Conveniently (and unlike many hotel rooms) not only were there overhead lights in the bedroom, but there were switches for turning the light on and off near the bed itself, making it very convenient if you like to read before going to bed. Also, because the hotel is on the old side, the rooms were actually much larger than you get in your usual London hotel. They were really quite roomy. The bathroom was a bit on the basic side design wise (old fashioned tub, exposed shower head and a shower curtain), and you should be aware that the hotel DOES NOT SUPPLY SHAMPOO, and the towels are really tiny. However, it was perfectly clean, and there was plenty of hot water and very good water pressure. We did not try the complimentary breakfast, as there are plenty of nice cafes and places to eat nearby, so I can't comment on that. Now, given all of the above, you might be asking yourself \"hmm... why would I stay in this okish, but somewhat shabby, hotel?\" Well, there are two answers: 1. Location, location, location! The hotel is right around the corner from Russell Square station, which puts it 5 minutes away from the British Museum, 10 minutes away from the British Library, a short walk from Covent Garden and the West End, and on the Piccadilly Line, which is one of London's most convenient Tube lines, especially if you are coming in from Heathrow. Honestly, I can't imagine a much better location than this if you're a tourist in London. 2. Given the outstanding location: the Price. We looked at every other option for a decent hotel in this kind of location, and honestly couldn't find anything that came even close to meeting the price of the President. So, bottom line: If you can afford to spend considerably more money, and/or are really persnickety about having an up-to-date, well designed hotel, go elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a well price deal at an outstanding location, but still want something clean and reasonably pleasant (if shabby) - this is a probably a good pick for you.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cGood location\u201d", "Author": "RonzPerth_Scotland", "ReviewID": "UR119067820", "Content": "We were a little disappointed with this hotel although it was in a good location for the tube station.

Just around the corner of the tube station and walking distance to the theater-land (Strand, Covent Garden etc). But that is all! This is a place without an official rating (The family chain of 6 hotels have rated their hotels to be 'similar' to the official rating system, according to the reception staff!) And I get the feeling this rating is not entirely neutral nor objective! My room (single) was very simple, without minibar or other facilities. The curtains were not adequate to keep light out and the walls were stained and sooty from lamps and radiators. Bed-springs were protruding from the mattress. Not even shampoo was available in the flimsy plastic shower-cabinet. I was unlucky and got one of the smallest rooms on the 7th floor. This floor is obviously an later extension to the hotel and the 78 rooms on the 7th floor is served by one lift only, that in addition was out of order for the most of the week. Paying rack-price for a single room on the 7the floor is not a good deal, indeed! I inquired at the reception about the possibility of getting a room on a lower floor, that had somewhat larger rooms but they were not responsive at all. They claimed all rooms were the same - thereby grossly insulting my intelligence. I got the feeling of being a commodity, not a guest. The common parts are tired and worn, wallpaper hanging loose from several places, carpets are soiled etc. The place is in a desperate need of refurbishment and solid spring cleaning!

It was quite low down on my list of hotels for a last minute business trip to London but all the hotels at the top of my list were fully booked. I found that since my previous stay some parts have been refurbished and the staff were particularly pleasant this time around. I stayed on the top floor and was pleased that on a warm evening the window opened - not always the case in some London hotels even some better ones! - and there was a bit of a rooftop outlook. A basic no frills room but clean, neat and with a spotless shower room with soap (not always provided in some hotels) etc. I booked via an agent - the only one that was able to offer a room at the hotel at a time when all local hotels seemed to be already booked up and all other agents said this one was as well so I expected that I would be allocated some sort of broom cupbard type option :-). Instead two single beds in a smallish room with a slightly creaky floor but with teh usual TV, kettle and coffee/tea provided. The price advertised on the hotel desk was a little less than I had pre-paid but then my online booking had said breakfast NOT included whereas the hotel DID provide me with a full English breakfast. The breakfast was the usual self service options that this level of hotels provides. This hotel still provides room keys - as opposed to the more common swipe cards - and the key was on a long metal stick. Though the key worked when I first arrived, the next morning after breakfast I could not unlock the door and had to obtain help from the porter's desk. I gather that I was not the first cleint to experience difficulty with the room lock. The help provided fixed the problem and I was on my way again. The main advantage of this hotel is that it is literally a corner away from Russel Square Tube station down a short narrow street. As a solo traveller who often has to return to the hotel at night I appreciate not having to walk far from public transport.

The President is in a really central location off Russell Square in Bloomsbury; a short walk from King\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Cross/St Pancras or the West End, so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really have to use the Underground all that much if you are staying in this area. Annoyingly, our key was not a modern swipe card, but a keyring with a foot-long chrome rod attached to it, which realistically had to be handed in at the concierge and recollected later \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which speaks volumes about the distrust with which they treat their customers. The room was OK \u00e2\u20ac\u201c clean enough with a newish looking carpet, and the bathroom had recently been retiled. The bed was an old fashioned divan thing that looked dated, as did most of the furniture. But it WAS somewhere to lay your head at the end of the day. It lost marks for the shower which seemed to be powered by a Karcher pressure washer, and required an awful lot of twiddling of the bath taps to get a decent temperature. The towels were wafer thin and looked like they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d been washed into oblivion, the complimentary toiletries \u00e2\u20ac\u201c well \u00e2\u20ac\u201c make sure you bring your own to be honest. No hairdryer, yet strangely there was the ubiquitous Corby trouser press. Whilst the foyer is welcoming, the 4th Floor corridor I was on was very scruffy and generally in need of TLC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it reminded me of a 1960s student hall of residence (that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s being polite) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with yellowed walls, peeling wallpaper, scuffed woodwork everywhere and a carpet that was probably there since the hotel was built all those decades ago. Noise is an issue. OK it IS the centre of London, and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hardly the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fault \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but if you end on up the Russell Square/Southampton Row side of the building be prepared for the late night soundtrack of sirens, drunk people shouting, construction machines, not to mention imbeciles on high powered motorbikes using Southampton Row as a drag strip in the early hours of the morning. My experience wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t helped by the gang of children in an adjacent room shouting out the window, who also pinched my \u00e2\u20ac\u0153do not disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign - which incidentally is hung from a protruding hook on the door. The piece de la resistance of my stay had to be when taking a shower I got a stroppy phone call from reception to say that the smoke alarm in my room had been triggered, and I should have kept the door shut. Fine if there had been a sign (like in a Premier Inn) to warn me of this, but there wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. To add insult to injury a manager was promptly sent up to our room, who barged his way in to open the windows whilst I was still sitting naked on the bed drying myself!!!!! He then uttered some tosh about \u00e2\u20ac\u0153so have you been having a party here\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have you been smoking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd?? The people in the room next door clearly had been \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there were cigarette ends jammed into the lintel beneath the window sill. But overall this sort of treatment was utterly unacceptable, something which I will be taking up with the company directly. After reading the other reviews about the appaling breakfast service I stayed away as soon as I saw the massive morning queue for the dining room. Luckily as a seasoned occasional Londoner I know a few nice \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcgreasy spoon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 cafes in the surrounding streets which offer a pretty good English breakfast for less than a fiver. The vast majority of people staying in this hotel (and its three brethren The Royal National, the Imperial and the Bedford owned by the same company) are school trip parties, coach parties and people on package holiday deals so they are never exposed to the headline rate which is \u00c2\u00a3112 per night. Looked at it this way, there are at least a dozen Premier Inns, Travelodges and iBIS\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s within a half mile radius with a far more consistent, more modern experience overall, at the very most for the same amount, and usually less. The bottom line is, if you get put in here as part of a package deal \u00e2\u20ac\u201c then it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a tolerable place to lay your head for the night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c think of it as the Ryanair of central London hotels \u00e2\u20ac\u201c cheap, but be prepared to make lots of compromises. If you are the type of person for whom the hotel is an integral part of the holiday then you will be bitterly disappointed.

In the reception of the hotel there is a horrible smell of what i thought smelled of ham. Staff all seemed pleasant enough. Breakfast in the morning was the usual full english as well as various cereals. But the cooked breakfast was only lukewarm. I am probably giving hotel more of bad write up than it deserves. If your wanting a basic hotel in a excellant location at a good price then this would be fine for you. I suppose the question would be would i stay again ...... well probably not i would pay the extra for the park inn or the hotel russell which i love. please feel free to contact me if you havew any questions.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Manchester", "Title": "\u201cVery good hotel in superb location.\u201d", "Author": "tofty75", "ReviewID": "UR87812799", "Content": "I stayed at this hotel with my partner on the 16th November 2010 for 1 night as a surprise trip for my birthday. I don't know what all the negative comments are about. The hotel was very clean and the room was more than adequate in size with a comfortable double bed and large bay window. the bathroom was also spacious and very clean with a decent shower. the corridors to the hotel smelt very fresh which straight away gave the impression of cleanliness. Im very fussy about hotels and this one was absolutely fine. The corridors were slightly dated but who cares about a corridor. The following morning we went down for breakfast. It was about 0915 and it was fairly busy. The wait for a table was only about 5 minutes which gave us enough time to come round after a night out in London! My partner just had toast and juice. I had a full english breakfast which was lovely. It couldnt be faulted. The breakfast was in the style of a help yourself buffet and included bacon, sausage, fried eggs, scrambled eggs, tomatoes, beans and toast. It was tasty and the food was hot. I could not complain and it set me up for the day. The coffee was also good. We heard a couple behind us complaining that they had to serve themselves.....would you do that if you went to America where everything is in the style of a buffett! Overall i was impressed with the stay at the President and would definately book again.

The place is smack on Russell square, round the corner from the Tube Station and the Tesco express. Hint number one - do not take the stairs at Russell Square tube station unless you're very fit, many gasping travellers make that mistake. If you're planning to hit the British Museum, you're golden, and it's not exactly far from Oxford Road/Theatreland, but the nearby tube means you're fine for getting around anywhere. The President is part of a small chain round Bloomsbury and seems to be the sweet spot for value versus facilities. I spent most of my time on this trip at an event at the nearby Royal National (as an aside, some friends were staying here and it was plagued by kids rampaging round the corridors and seemed nowhere near as nice - do yourself a favour and spend the extra couple of quid at the President.) Reception was well run and staff were very friendly and helpful (especially so by London standards) no worries checking in, also smooth leaving luggage on the day I was checking out. Word of caution - if you resent leaving your room key at reception, you've got a shock coming - instead of the usual oversize fobs, the keys are on long rods which you'll only put in your pocket if you want to risk an alarming injury. The rods cleverly slot into holes on the key rack to make it easy for the staff to grab them. I didn't eat evening meal in the restaurant, but breakfast was fine. Not amazing, but plenty of it and reasonable variety for the money. Once again in my reviews, I recommend if you're going to eat breakfast in the hotel, buy it as part of your package, as it will save you a ton of cash. Believe you can have continental or FEB, my package included FEB. Similarly didn't use the bar, as I know a couple of pubs nearby that are pretty decent. For most people in London, you're going to be doing stuff away from the hotel most of the time and will be kipping there and grabbing a shower and that's about it. My room was clean, pretty well equipped for London money and very pleasant. Good window insulation, a big factor in London, as it's too easy to be hassled by street noise in older cheaper hotels, no worries here though. Trouser press, telly, kettle etc, shower , bath and loo en suite. No mini bar or safe, but safes at reception and limited number of fridges available, with preference given to people needing them for meds. baby milk etc. Bed was a decent size and comfy. Room was well cleaned and all the staff were great. No compy toileteries other than soap, but you can ask for shower gel etc at reception - not a worry as I take my own normally anyway. Overall, the staff are great, location is very good, and for the money, it's very hard to beat in London. When I go to London doing the usual touristy stuff with the missus, we ususally go to the Thistle Trafalgar, which is a smashing place, but the difference in price could amount to a couple of shows or decent restaurant meals. Very good compromise between economy and cleanliness - basic and clean in a good way. Final note as a general thing - get hold of an Oyster card for an easy way to get round London - we live in South Yorkhire, but both have Oyster cards for occasional forays to the smoke (and/or out company offices there!) and if you do try the President (which I can recommend with no qualms) try the nearby Thai Dream restaurant, or if you want an eaterie nearer theatreland, Arbutus gives you Michelin star food on the cheap, pre theatre menu is a bargain - can't remember the last time I spent time in London and didn't eat there at least once.

On the positive side, it is minutes away from the Russel Square tube station and close to many popular attractions within central London. We stayed in a room on the 5th floor overlooking the atrium - not too noisy. You can purchase theatre tickets from the front desk as well as arrange for tours.There is a restaurant that is open for buffet breakfast and a sit-down dinner. On the downside, if you are used to staying at a typical Norh American hotel you will need to reduce your expectations. Upon check-in, staff offered minimal information about hotel services. Our room offered only basic amenities - double bed, tv with remote, 2 bath towels, toilet paper, small bar soaps, tea and coffee. Do not expect to see the following items in your room: air conditioning or fan, mini fridge, tissue box, clock radio, face cloths, hair dryer, ice box or an iron. July 2010 was particularly hot in London with 30C temperatures and it did occassionally become unbearably hot in the room with no fan or A/C (or ice). For ironing, one could go down to the 2nd floor ironing room where a single iron on a timer is available. For internet access, one could pay to have access to an antiquated machine in the foyer with a rolling ball instead of a mouse (1 pound for 15 minutes access). The bathroom sinks have a separate faucet for hot and cold water which could be a bit tricky if your are travelling with a young child. The full breakfast buffet was quite nice but it consisted of the same items everyday. No pancakes or waffles for young kids.

The quality of the food in a restaurant that appeared to cater almost exclusively for large groups of foreign schoolchildren was bad enough to make me resent eating it, even though I hadn't paid for it! No wonder English food has a bad international reputation.

We had read all of the reviews and had come away 'just hoping for the best'. The hotel is fine! Yes it probably could do with some updating and yes guess what the centre of London does get traffic but it is clean, it is in a fantastic location (really close to a tube station and bus stops) and I was glad that we were put into one of the rooms overlooking the noisy road because we also got the fantastic views across Russell Square too. I think it would be a shame if too much were changed though as the hotel does have a lovely charm about it - a good old fashioned reception area - if you want super modern and so brilliantly lit that it hurts your eyes to walk in - go somewhere new and modern. This hotel was warm and cozy and welcoming when you walked in despite it being quite a large hotel. The secondary glazing is not brilliant but as we were here in Winter and the heating was on we had it open anyway as we found the room a little too warm. Sheets and blankets and bed covers are used instead of quilts but ours were spotlessly clean and changed daily and were fine to sleep under. We paid \u00c2\u00a395 per night which I had booked with the hotel itself and that included dinner on the first night and full English breakfast on both mornings. The evening meal at this hotel is a carvery which was good enough for us to book in and pay on the second night (\u00c2\u00a317.75 for three courses but cheaper in the early evening I think). There were four different meats and there had been four different started (including a huge selection of hors d'ouvres) and then seven or eight different desserts with tea or coffee included too. The wine list was not too expensive either. The breakfast was fine too. Fried, scrambled, poached or boiled eggs, sausages, bacon, tinned tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, beans, fruit, cereals, toast, rolls, tea, coffee, hot chocolate and juices. We did not go through to look at the continental breakfast so do not know what that was like. The reception staff, porters, restaurant staff and cleaners were all very friendly and helpful. We were able to leave our bags with the porters after we checked out for 50p per bag for the day (bear in mind this compares to \u00c2\u00a38 per bag at railway stations in the city). In summary I would say that if you want a five star hotel in a quiet area - don't come here. It is a perfectly adequate three star hotel in the heart of a loud noisy city. If you want to be in the city in a hotel that is perfectly fine then I would recommend this one. (the only outright criticism I would have of this hotel is that they were a little mean with towels - just one each but then we did not ask for more so maybe we could have got more if we had done).

Lesson for London is that if the hotel rate is too good to be true -- it IS too good to be true. The location, just around the corner from the Russell Square tube station, is convenient, and the very young staff were friendly, but that's about all I can say in its favor. It is dingy and run down, and although the bathroom was spotlessly clean, the towels were threadbare, and the bed and bedclothes were ill-fitting and of suspicious cleanliness. The mattress was so thin and lumpy that I got up in the middle of my first night unable to sleep. I decided to put the extra blanket on top of the mattress to serve as mattress pad, and so proceeded to undue the bedclothes. That was when I discovered that the old, thin, ill-fitting mattress pad was covered with pee stains -- some of which seemed to be fairly new! It was disgusting. I pulled the mattress cover off and didn't even use it, then looked each sheet over carefully before putting it back on the bed. Needless to say, I did not have a comfortable night. I contacted housekeeping in the morning and they responded by bringing over another old, thin, ill-fitting mattress pad, albeit without pee stains. For the rest of my stay I kept the extra blanket on the mattress both as pad and as shield from the mattress. The other problem with sleeping in this hotel is that the walls are paper thin. I did not have a single good night of sleep due to noise from neighboring rooms, in addition to the uncomfortable bed. I could hear neighbors talking, I could hear their TV (which they kept on nearly all night long), I could hear the man next door peeing, and I could also hear him snoring all night long! Also, I will never forget the BANGING shut of all the doors up and down the hallway.

First impressions weren't bad. The decor could do with a little bit of TLC, but that is a minor issue. On arrival, we were greeted by friendly check in staff who checked us in with no problems at all. We were advised that we were going to be in room 324 - which is a disabled accessible twin room on the third floor (obviously!). I am a wheelchair user and have had \"wheelchair accessible rooms\" before in different establishments, so my wife and I were a bit hesitant - but we needn't have been. Almost without exception, this is by far THE BEST disabled/wheelchair accessible room we've had the good fortune to stay in. In other establishments, wheelchair accessible rooms have been \"just\" and no more, whereas this room at the President is HUGE. A standard wheelchair can be moved about with ease throughout the room AND in the bathroom, which is equipped with a walk/roll in shower, grab rails etc. It is my understanding that most if not ALL of the wheelchair accessible rooms are directly above and below this room e.g. 224/424/524 etc. The room was SPOTLESSLY clean (cleaned every day) and bed linen and towels are replaced every day. Whether it was just during our stay or is normal practice, or just in the wheelchair accessible rooms, but with regards to bed linen, there aren't any duvets, but a top sheet, blanket and bedspread are provided! If you want a quieter night's sleep, our suggestion would be to get a room ABOVE the third floor. Maybe because we come from a quiet street at home, we noticed quite a bit of traffic noise at most times of the day - despite double glazing, but by the second day we had got used to it. The rate we payed for our room included a cooked English Breakfast. Most of the time it was busy, but the dining room supervisor was doing a sterling job in seating everybody that went down for breakfast. When people had finished, the tables were very quickly cleared and reset. The choice of food wasn't bad either considering it is included in the room rate. We would advise that if taking the English Breakfast, arrival would be better about 9.00 - 9.15am (Breakfast is served 7-10 Monday to Saturday) as the food tends to be hotter than if you take breakfast before 9am. The downsidfe to that is that that appears to be when a majority of guests decide to take breakfast, so a queue isn't uncommon. We have stayed elsewhere in London and have to say The President compares well. In other hotels in London for example, a disabled/wheelchair accessible room attracts a higher room rate - we paid \u00c2\u00a395 a night for our twin room at The President - the same as everybody else would pay! The hotel is IDEALLY situated for ALL the popular tourist attractions - London Eye, British Museum etc. Investing in an Oyster Card is also a good idea - we saved a fortune in taxis as all London Buses are wheelchair accessible. Reception can provide you with a Bus Map at no charge which shows you bus routes. In closing, my wife and would have NO HESITATION in staying at The President again in the future - plans are already being made for a return visit.

No one had offered this information when we were pointed (rather than shown) to the table. The starter was fine. Mixed hors d'oeuvres, prawn cocktail or soup. And our bottle of wine arrived as we were finishing it! But the main meal was just awful! There was a choice of chicken breast wrapped in bacon, very over-cooked looking salmon steaks, or beef, lamb or pork roast. My husband and I both chose the beef, both asking for meat that was pink, so the chef at least had to cut further into the joint, rather than give us the slices which looked as though they'd been carved and sitting for some time. But it didn't help. We had both commented that it was hard to mess up roast beef, but how wrong we were! The meat was so chewy that it was almost impossible to cut and then decidedly unpleasant to have in your mouth. It's an absolute first for both of us: we left the meal - and found a nearby restaurant for our evening meal. Absolutely inedible. At breakfast the next day, we joined a long queue spilling out of the dining room and across the adjoining bar. A member of staff was on the phone inside the restaurant and looked a little panicked at the number of people waiting for breakfast. Inside the dining room the quue was the length of the room - and it wasn't moving very quickly. Every seat in the room was full. We didn't wait and headed off to get breakfast somewhere else. The hotel was very noisy in the morning when housekeeping got going. And we've never had to put the 'do not disturb' sign on a hotel door as a matter of routine, but at the President Hotel you need to - otherwise, housekeeping will be knocking on your door at a very early hour! On the plus side, and I realise that you don't need to eat there, it's very central and really close to the underground, so getting around is easy. That said, I won't be going back there!

The location for our work and London exploring was excellent. However the service and the hotel aesthetics itself was less than satisfactory, and I would never pay for staying at the President unless I was desperate and couldn't find anything else better for the price range. Here is what I am experiencing at the hotel right now: My husband says he cannot eat the English breakfast after the third day, as he feels it is so bad. I think the cold cereal choice is fine and can make do. However, yesterday the housekeeper had a vacuum cleaner with a long hose across the entrance to the packed breakfast room. Although I thought I took a big, high step over it, it was not high enough, and I fell on the floor. The Housekeeper sought me out during breakfast to tell me that it was not her fault since she was told to vacuum there. It seemed to me it would have been nice if someone from the hotel could have apologized. But I knew better than to expect it. This is because when I checked in, the woman behind the desk gave me a key to the wrong room. It was only when I opened the closet did I see that someone else's clothes was inside it. When I reported that someone else was in the room, there was not an apology at all. I was given another key as if it was normal to be given a key to another person's occupied room. Today when I was cut off on a phone call, I asked for credit so I didn't have to pay 1 pound for a local mobile home call per minute, but was told \"absolutely not.\" We have to request toilet paper when we are out and there is no paper and pen in the room for writing messages. The dry cleaning and laundry cost is extremely expensive. On and on it goes on a daily basis. The one exception to indifference customer service are the bell men behind the front counter. For the most part, they are very polite and helpful. Maybe I am spoiled because I live in Hawaii where people working in our tourist industry take pride in giving visitors service. But I can't imagine the people working here have been trained to serve the customers. Okay, I must admit the location is fabulous. Check out La Stada restaurant in near-by Brunswick Shopping Center. So much to see and do so close by. You have to decide before you go here: Can you put up with indifference service, uninspired surroundings, crowds of people eating a lousy breakfast? Is is worth all this for an affordable room in a great location in London? If you really don't care where you sleep, then stay here then.

We found the President Hotel to be a comfortable hotel, with quality rooms, good staff, but poor breakfast. We stayed in a standard room, which included two single beds, a cupboard, widescreen TV (on 2nd visit) or a normal TV (on 1st visit), a kettle, draws, heater, clothes press and a simple bathroom including a sink, bath/shower and toilet. The room was by no means luxurious, but it was comfortable and clean. The shower had tremendous water pressure and the water temperature could be controlled easily. Unfortunately, the shower curtain encroached a little on our limited space, but that was just a small annoyance. Otherwise, the room itself was very comfortable. The hotel also offered free wireless internet in their lounge area. Unfortunately, the speed of connection was dependent on where you sat and how many other people were accessing it at the same time. I was using it while a group of 10 to 15 American school people were trying to use it and I found that it was incredibly slow, but when I moved to another position, the coverage all of a sudden sped up dramatically. In terms of the breakfasts offered by the hotel, guests were offered a Continental or English style. We paid for the English style on our booking, and I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t impressed by the breakfasts at all and wished that we had only paid for the basic continental breakfast. The range offered wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bad, but the fact that the scrambled eggs, bacon and toast were all cold, the juices weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cold or chilled and the fruit was rather sour wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t good. It was just not how I like to start my day. With this being said, the second and briefer stay we had at this hotel in January \u00e2\u20ac\u212209, the breakfast was a lot better, but I would still not suggest that it was a good breakfast at all. The location of the hotel was fantastic. Being just around the corner from Russell Square Tube station allowed for an easy train ride to and from Heathrow Airport along the Piccadilly line and then also an easy one stop ride to Kings Cross/St Pancreas Station, which is the London international station for Eurostar. The city proper was about a 10 minute walk, the British Museum was a 5 minute walk and then there were a couple of good restaurants around the area, including Munchkins (just past directly opposite the British Museum entrance) and Pizza Express. This hotel was only one of two that we booked through the hotel itself for our entire trip. It is right next to the Imperial Hotel, which is a relation to this hotel, but more expensive. For what I saw, the two hotels were very similar and yet the President Hotel was considerably cheaper. While on the topic of money, let me give all those who haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been to London a small word of advice in terms of the currency. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t look at something you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re considering buying and convert it back to your home currency. Look at it and think about whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s cheap compared to similar products that you are choosing from. Watch what you spend or put a limit on your pound spending, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t convert back until the end of your trip. Food, drink, attraction entrances, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re all expensive and even more so when converting back to your home currency. But you have to eat, you have to drink and you have to experience London. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve attached a couple of pictures for people to view how the rooms look. Please excuse the mess. So in all, London was an interesting place and if I do go back to London, the President Hotel is where I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just without the breakfast.", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cNot bad\u201d", "Author": "roscoe4", "ReviewID": "UR24192042", "Content": "Stayed in the hotel for four nights, i booked it because i stayed there when on a course in london last year and i thought it was ok what i can remember ,its very close to the westend shows and everything you could wish to see in london is not to far away.

The room was not huge but enough space to place luggage and still move around. The bathrooms were recently upgraded and the towels were soft. The t.v was small but adequate enough to fall asleep too. We were looking for a place close to transit, at a reasonable price. The morning breakfast was included in our price and was a simple English breakfast, scrambled, toast, sausage, juices, beans, tomato's, cereals. Nice because food isn't cheap in London.

I had stayed here 20 years ago and it was nice then. I am happy to report it was even better now. People, especially those from North America and Australia should understand that hotel rooms in Central London are small. That's just the way it is. I did alot of research in advance and decided to stay here based on my previous experience, the rate, and the location. I booked a single room on the Imperial Hotel website for 70 GBP per night for bed and breakfast. This is the same rate that is posted outside the hotel. I arrived on a Sunday morning at 9:30 after an overnight flight from the USA. Happily, I was able to check into my room straight away-which was very nice. I had a single room on the top (7th) floor overlooking the inner courtyard--while the view was uninspiring it was quiet. The room had private bathroom (shower only), trouser press, tea/coffee making, and TV with satellite channels and 4 radio stations. The single bed was extremely comfortable. You could also open the window for fresh air. The bathroom was very nice--always almost instant hot water. The shower was a bit small, but was not a problem. I could have borrowed a hair dryer but brought my own with me. Included with my reservation was a free dinner at the hotel the 1st night. | could have taken dinner at 3 other Imperial Hotel properties in the area but chose to dine in the hotel. Very nice 3 course meal. While I never took Room Service the menu in the room had a nice selection at very reasonable prices. I reserved one coach tour directly from the hotel concierge. They can also book other tours, theater tickets, etc. They had free WiFi in their lobby and Atrium area which connects the President and the Imperial Hotels. I didn't bring my laptop, but there were always several people who did. I asked someone about the connection and they said it was fine--i.e. not overly slow. There is a Barclay's Bank on premises and an outdoor ATM. The Russell Square Tube station is just around the corner. Very convenient. My sheets and towels were changed daily. A couple times I put a pencil mark on my sheets so I could tell they had been changed. A \"full English Breakfast\" was included in the rate. They always had fried eggs, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, fried tomatoes, toast, peaches, grapefruit, apple and orange juice, and tea and coffee. It was buffet style. It was excellent. After a hearty breakfast I found I was pretty well for the day. Many central London hotels only offer a \"Continental Breakfast\" or none at all. You can upgrade to a full breakfast for 10 to 15 GBP extra. I believe this is one of the best tourist class hotels in central London.

My room was on the top floor at the back of the hotel which i didnt mind as i requested a high floor. The back rooms in the hotel are noisy early morning as there are delivery vans. This was rather loud and woke me up but its not a major problem as at the end of the day your staying in a very busy city and this is expected. Breakfast was very nice. Guest can have as much as they want, Lots of choice, such as bacon eggs, beans, toast,sausage,cerial,milk, fresh orange, tea,coffee, eggs,kippers,tomatoes,fruit. Breakfast rooms are divided into two rooms. One for English full breakfast the other for continental. Every morning at breakfast time there is a very strong smell of kippers. I found this very funny but it did not put me off the hotel. Hotel staff were pleasant. Information desk is located in hotel where guests can purchase attraction tickets and theatre tickets etc. Internet access located in seating area near reception.

The cost would have been 93 pounds/nt for a double, which is $185 nowadays. London hotels are expensive, and the pound is strong, so if that is the price range you would like for a simple hotel in a good location, this is a nice option. It is very close to the Russel Square tube stop, and right off the Russel Square park (which has a lovely cafe). The British Museum is a couple short blocks away, and then Charing Cross Road which leads to all sorts of cute shopping streets, Old Compton Street (the gay area) and then to Leicester Square. I was skeptical when I saw this hotel on a map, but in reality, the location was ideal. The hotel itself looks a little lackluster. It could use a makeover. But our room was fine. It had a strong shower, a view of the park, a simple decor with a comfortable bed. I didn't like the florescent lighting, or the plastic (I am not sure what it was) between the mattress and our sheets which you could hear when you moved around on the bed.

There was free wi-fi in this salon as well. The distance from Heathrow to this hotel was about 1 hour on the Picadilly tube...no transfer required. I heard there are faster ways to make this journey, but I loved not having to change trains. And it was only 4 pounds ($8) for the one way ticket.

The music goes on and on until all hours which is a huge let down to the hotel itself as they cannot do anything to prevent this. This however, did stop me from sleeping. If you book (I think it's 2 or more nights, you get a free 3 course roast dinner on the first night. This was gorgeous! The portions were a good size and were lovely tasting.

The full english however, had a great selection of foods varying from eggs, fruit, cereal, toast, bacon, tomatoes and lots more. It was gorgeous! The service was great, as the bell boys knew exactly what to do all the time. One of them even stood out in the terrential rain to catch me a cab! However, the staff on the reception desk were unfortunately not very knowledgable, all requests and queries got sent straight to the bell boys, but that was ok as they knew what to do. The rooms were quite standard but homely. Our room had a bath and a shower attatched and we had our own toilet. The only thing that I would mention about the rooms is that on the website it says that rooms will be equipped with a hairdryer and refridgerator, yet ours had neither of these privileges. If I'd have known this beforehand I would have brought my own hairdryer from home, but it worked out ok in the end.

The menu is absolutely the same for each day of all 30 years this hotel exists and it is not rich. Tea and coffee are far from ideal. BUT. It is just London's way to feed her guests. In all hotels you will find the same: it is just traditional British breakfast. We have an experience with London hotels of higher leagues: precisely the same picture there.

My room had a single bed, a small desk, a color tv [which worked fine] and a small bathroom with a small bar of soap and a very small bottle of shampoo [which I didn't even use.] A small window looked over Russell Square and the Tube Station is a block and half away. There's a 24 hour Tesco Metro [convenience store/market] across from the Tube stop and a decent pub a half block from the hotel. And while there is a wide variety of people staying there - from backpackers to families to business folks - this is one of those properties that can grate on you. You're not inclined to go back to the hotel to relax - it's for sleeping only. Sure, the bed was comfortable enough and the room was clean - but it's very basic accommodation; more like a school dorm than a hotel room charging over $115 a night for a room. I also noted a lot of laundry and trash in the hallways, torn carpets, chipped paint and the kind of small maintenance issues that you're likely not to find in a better maintained property. Another issue is security. I didn't have any problems and the neighborhood, Bloomsbury, isn't considered dangerous. The hotel is a relatively modern structure with a large lobby and a manned front desk. I'm not sure what kind of cctv coverage/security the hotel has, but assume it's relatively secure. But at night, no one is checking room keys so it is possible for someone to walk in off the street and gain elevator access. The rooms all have magnetic key cards which provides a somewhat higher degree of security. As part of the rate deal I got by booking through the hotel's website, I was offered a free buffet breakfast for all three nights. I went the first morning; and skipped the other complimentary breakfasts [which says something.] The food was a bit rough looking - scrambled eggs, bacon, toast - but not done well; very utilitarian. The toast was burned and brittle; the eggs didn't taste right. I ended up walking over to Pret-a -Manger [across from the Tube station] and buying a breakfast sandwich there. So, would I recommend this hotel? If you've got to save money and there are no other options; it beats sleeping on the street. But if you're able to fork out some more; than by all means do. I've been to London 30+ times in the past ten years and only once did I find a less suitable place which I won't even mention here. But as a well traveled, 45 year old, educated professional man who has stayed at some of the better hotels in the world [including the Four Seasons at Canary Wharf] The President was a let down. I didn't enjoy my overall trip to London and I suspect the experience at the President was a big part of it.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "DK", "Title": "\u201cExpensive low-budget, low-standard hotel.\u201d", "Author": "busymonkey", "ReviewID": "UR11708232", "Content": "We stayed for three days in early December 2007. Location is good. 5 minute walk from underground station, which is perfect. Staff were friendly on arrival. Got our room, and the first thing that hit us was the surreal heat. Apparently the heater was all the way up, with the adjusting mechanism broken, so it took a few minutes to figure out how to turn it down, opening windows to cool down the sauna. Then we got a good view of the room, which was very small. Terrible lighting, not a single bulb, just very unpleasant bright cathode lighting throughout. Bathroom was small, and without any kind of extras, such as a hairdryer. Room was clean. Double bed was on the small size, reasonable comfortable, with a mattress on the hard side. There was quite a bit of noise during the night, as people came and went. You could audibly hear closing doors, talking in the halls etc. Next morning we went down to the continental breakfast, included in the price of the room. Breakfast restaurant was separated into two departments, \"English breakfast\" and in the back \"Continental breakfast\". The English breakfast looked delicious with bacon and eggs, but oh no, to get the English breakfast, we'd have to pay 4 punds extra per person per day. We were kindly told to go in the back, where we were fed the most insulting breakfast I've ever had. Seriously, I've never had tea or coffee tasting this bad. The bread tasted and felt like it was days old. I wouldn't serve this to my enemies. And that basically sums up our stay nicely.

We actually live not far from London and only stayed one night - I pitied those who booked a stay for a week or more for vacation. The room was fairly small, and the walls paper thin. the decor was ugly, dingy looking, and dated. For being in the center of London, you would think they would have card keys for better security, but they only had the traditional metal keys (which you have to turn in when you leave). There were no extras offered in the room - no washcloths, no blow dryer, no iron (I even asked for one), and no shower cap (they did have shampoo and tea). The bed had no support, but at least the sheets were clean. Housekeeping started knocking on everyone's doors just after 8a.m. - no chance of sleeping in for us. Very strange. Continental breakfast - HORRIBLE. Choose between a few cereals, thin white bread, coffee/tea, and that's about it. If you want the full English breakfast (which didn't look good) you pay an additional four pounds and get to sit in the \"nice\" side of the dining area. We stayed on a Saturday and the dining room was so full and chaotic (with a line even) that it was like a military chow hall - only the food was worse! If you want to leave your bag at the hotel after checkout, you have to pay (50p). Being a guest and having already overpaid for the hotel room, that was very annoying. The only bonus about the hotel was the location. It's in Russell Square, very close to the Russell Square tube stop (just one away from King's Cross). The place we booked through gave the hotel three stars, but it was an easy two star (and on the low end at that).

In January - the low season, I suppose - I was able to get a single room for \u00c2\u00a3 89 for two week-end nights, incl. full English breakfast. An exceptional price for Bloomsbury, very near the rack rate of the low-end hotel of the same chain (County Hotel of Imperial Hotels, \u00c2\u00a340 per night - see my review of it). For that you get a rather spacious room (by London standards), with full en-suite. The bath filled (with really hot water) and emptied quickly - the shower worked. Both bath and washbasin had fitting plugs. The taps and WC cistern did not leak. Good quality coat hangers are provided, in a wardrobe which closes properly. All this is unusual in London hotels at less than \u00c2\u00a360 per person per night. Admittedly, as some visitors have pointed out, you do not get any shampoo or fancy body lotion. There is no hair dryer, but a trouser press (an obvious bias towards businessmen during the week). The downside with the Imperial Hotels chain is that the coffee-making facilities are the same whatever the hotel. You do not get a better selection (including cocoa, for instance) if you go to a more expensive hotel than the bottom-line County Hotel. And the \"coffee\" served with breakfast is the same horrid potion whatever the grade of the hotel. I would hesitate to go during the hot season. It would be impossible to sleep with the windows open. Some rooms look out on the street, and London traffic never stops, day and night. Others, like mine, look out on the back yard. But then there is a gigantic ventilation plant with noisy engines rumbling all the night. You cannot win. I do not understand the criticism by other visitors concerning the breakfast room and the lifts: I found them clean and functional, and the decor of the bar (old sporting equipment) is nice for foreign tourists who come to England to reinforce their preconceptions.

We had booked the hotel & Dirty Dancing show tickets as a package, as I couldn't get tickets on their own. I knew the hotel was at the cheaper end of the market, but wasn't overly concerned as the reviews on TripAdvisor were reasonable & we didn't plan to stay too long in the room anyway. A couple of days before we arrived, I had an accident with my foot which left me in plaster & on crutches - suddenly I was lot more apprehensive about the hotel & the trip. I needn't have worried! Firstly, if you are travelling from Heathrow into London then this hotel is ideal. It is on the Piccadilly Line which runs direct from Heathrow every 5 minutes with no changes required. Get off the tube at Russell Square, and it's about a dozen steps from the platform up to the lifts which take you to street level. At the front entrance to the tube station, there is a 24-hour Tesco Express immediately facing you, which is ideal for any last-minute necessities or a quick snack. Turn Left, walk about 30 yards, and take the first small street on your Left (Herbrand Street) and you can see the hotel facing you. It's no more than a minute's walk from the tube station - 2 minutes if you're on crutches! <lol> The reception is large & airy, but certainly not modern. The bar & restuarant is to your Left, lifts & stairs immediately facing you, and reception to your Right. Check-in took less than 2 minutes, and we got a bonus - a free evening meal for 2 on the first night courtesy of the package company. We didn't know anything about this, apparently it was a limited special offer, and it could be used at any of the FIVE hotels in the same chain in the immediate vicinity. The voucher did say that it could be used on the first night only, but when I explained to the receptionist that we already had a table booking for that evening she immediately offered [even before I could ask] to amend the voucher so that that it could be used on our second night (which is when we were going to the show) with no problem at all. There are four lifts immediately adjacent to each other, and with the porter assisting we had checked-in and got to the room in 5 minutes flat ... takes some beating. The room itself was pretty small, and the bed was even smaller. This will be an issue if you are tall ... I am 5'10\" and my feet were touching the bottom of the bed. The room was clean as was the bathroom, though only one bath towel each - no hand towels. This is where the budget element of the hotel appears. The shower was fine, pretty powerful, and no issues with hot water. There was a wardrobe with lots of hangers in it, and space for our luggage. There was no view to speak of out the window, as our room faced into an internal courtyard, but definitely not an issue for us ... we were not staying in this hotel to sit & look out the window! That first evening I had a table reservation at a Bangladeshi restaurant in SOuthampton Row, which was only a 10-minute walk from the hotel even with my crutches, and it was fab. There are LOADS of restaurants within 5-10 minutes walk of the hotel, simply turn Left & walk directly up to Russell Square (1 minute). There is a Barclays Bank on the corner (free cash machine), and turn Left walking up Southampton Row. We counted at least twenty restaurants of varying styles & prices before we reached the one we had booked online (35% discount at the Hason Raja just by booking online, superb). We also passed another Tesco Express here as well, though not sure if this one was open 24hrs. When we came out of the restaurant it was raining heavily, and I was quite tired, so we headed back to the hotel. We had a drink at the bar, which was pretty reasonable for Central London (under a fiver for a pint of lager & a glass of wine) before heading to bed. We had no noise issues at all with our room, didn't hear another soul even though the hotel was full (as we overheard some turn-up arrivals being told). If you are the sort of person who complains about only having whitener or no teapot in your room (even though the in-room hospitality tray was perfectly acceptable in the morning for tea/coffee) then The President is not for you. Breakfast on Saturday morning was great, lots of fruit & cereal to choose from, and many different hot items in the buffet section. The breakfast tables are not indivdual, the tables are all pushed together to make large tables seating 12-16 but it's not a problem to get a seat on your own if you choose to do so. We travelled around London on the tube (\u00c2\u00a318 for a 3-day pass covering all six zones including Heathrow) & found that Russell Square was ideally placed. Direct link to Knightsbridge for Harrods, also Oxford Circus & Leicester Square, and only 2 stops/no changes to Covent Garden on the Saturday night for the show. Travelling to Westminster for the London Eye was quick & effortless and the same for Camden Town on Sunday morning for the market. The concierge service at the hotel was great, always asking if we needed assistance with anything & ensuring that I was okay on my crutches. They will hail a taxi for you if required, and have great knowledge about where to go & what to see. The Saturday night at the hotel restaurant was a carvery, and is priced at \u00c2\u00a317.95 , so getting this free for both of us was good value. It opens at 5:30pm, and we were there on time (no reservation required), and quickly got seated & served our starters of prawn cocktail ... good tall glasses with lots of prawns, with additional salad available. The food was great, and I wouldn't have minded paying the \u00c2\u00a317.95 at all for the convenience of being able to dine pre-theatre in the hotel itself before catching the tube to Covent Garden. We were up early on Sunday morning to check-out, when the fire alarm went off around 9am. We quickly exited the room & walked to the elevators which also had a stairwell emergency exit. There was no panic, everyone just moved along at a reasonable pace. We gathered outside the hotel on the opposite side at the street. There were hotel fire wardens visible, but no attempts made to advise anyone of what was going on. The fire brigade were on the scene within a couple of minutes of us getting outside, and we were back in the hotel within 20 minutes as it was only a false alarm. As we had almost finished packing anyway, we went back to our room & returned to reception to check-out. Again this was effortless & fuss-free. We spoke to the concierge, who took our luggage to the locked luggage room behind the lifts, as we were not flying home until Sunday evening, and there was no problem leaving our luggage & collecting it later. This costs a massive 50p per bag - best bargain of the weekend! All-in-all, this is a reasonablly priced budget hotel. If you don't expect luxury, get it for a decent price, & don't plan to spend hours sitting in your room then the location of this hotel makes it ideal if you're attending a show in the West End or planning to see the sights over a weekend.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStay away - noisy building site\u201d", "Author": "realz", "ReviewID": "UR6095287", "Content": "This was the worse hotel i have stayed in.

The hotel is in a good location considering it is near Russel Square Tube Station and with nearby grocery store, convenience store and pub. The hotel is dated and old. Rooms are clean but small although the 2 twin bed rooms which my children stayed are larger than the double bed rooms. The bathrooms are newly renovated although they did not supply shampoo nor was there a hairdryer. It was quite hot/warm when we stayed there and there is no air conditioning so we have to open the windows at night. The morning reception people is fine, however, i don't find the night shift people to be friendly. They also do not answer reception calls immediately. I really don't find the service to be that great. Continental breakfast served is nothing fancy (Toast,coffee, tea, orange juice, cereal). Additional 4 pounds if you want to do an American buffet (with sausage and bacon). If you just needed a place to sleep at night, then the hotel is fine.

As a business hotel it's pretty terrible, it doesn't feel particularly clean, the decor and everything about it just smacks of 1970s, your key is on a giant metal pole, there's no hairdryers, there's an ironing room with scabby ironing boards and an iron with dubious wiring. I was staying in a room on the second floor which appears to be the smoking floor in the hotel which still has the original shockingly bad patterned carpet. Other floors seemed to have been modernised however. The hotel reception has a really bad smell of overcooked roast dinners as there is a nightly cavery in the restaurant. In its favour however the staff are polite and incredibly helpful which I find is something of a rarity in London. It's in a great location, Russell Square tube station is a short walk away, and if you are in London on holiday and don't want to blow your budget on accommodation and aren't planning to spend much time in the hotel then for \u00c2\u00a389 a night you probably can't complain. The rooms are of a good size for London standards and the showers are very powerful which is always a bonus.

Maybe because we paid full rack rate we got extra good treatment. The double room was exceptionally large for a tourist class London hotel. The room was not fancy - for Americans, think Motel 6. There was plenty of hot water. Although we used the stairs mostly, we noticed the lifts were working whenever we went thru the lobby. The room was on the first floor (one flight up from street) overlooking a quiet back garden. The weather was cool during our stay, so double glazing helped keep the room warm. Free wi-fi is available in the lobby of the Imperial Hotel, which connects to the lobby of the President. Any breakfast that includes English bacon is ok with us, but the full breakfast buffet was outstanding. In America we don't usually have stewed tomatoes, baked beans, and fish for breakfast, but we certainly enjoy the variety when we are in London. We didn't need a snack before noon with the buffet full breakfast.
