We found the deal on the net and Think that it offers good value for Calistoga. The staff were friendly and showed us a couple of rooms prior to us saying yes. The room had recently been decorated was very clean and comfortable. It had a sauna but we didn't feel the need to use it after the mud treatment. There is a slight aged feel to some of the decoration in certain places in the room eg the tiling around the bath, but it was all very clean and something that doesn't worry me given the price we were paying. Location is a little out of town but a short walk (about 7 mins) and your on the high street. Plus it gives you an opportunity to walk off the massive meal you may have had in town. Treatments were very good, staff made you feel relaxed and welcome. The post treatment massage was excellent. The mud was weird but great fun, particularly when you do it as a couple. The advantage that you have with stopping over is that you can just amble back to your room in your robes, post treatment. Awesome! Is this a 5 star spa? No. But it's somewhere fun, offering clean 3 star motel style accommodation and good treatments. The only thing that they need to do more than anything is get rid of the cheesy porn-like promo photography! It's not like that at all and is no doubt putting a few people off.

I have to say that the person who wrote the review titled \"We thought this was a joke... where's the camera?\" gets the prize for writing a review that perfectly summed up our \"spa\" experience. (If you want a good laugh, read her review). We stayed in one of the jacuzzi rooms, which was actually bit better than I expected (having read many reviews that said the place was really run down). Our room and bathroom were not run down at all - quite the contrary... the room looked like it had been redone within the past couple of years. The \"soaker\" jacuzzi's in the room are kind of old and a little funky looking, but they were clean and the water is great, and being able to soak whenever you want in your room was a nice luxury (if you can get past the rotting egg / sulphur smell of the mineral water in your room, which some people complained about, but it didn't bother us at all). I would say the room was very \"average\" considering it's high cost (over $250. a night). Here's the \"mixed bag\" part -- the \"spa\" experience. It started off well with us waiting in a nice foyer, while someone got us glasses of iced lemon water. But once we were ushered in, the experience began going downhill fast. First off, there are signs everywhere asking people to \"be quiet in the spa areas\" but the staff seems to be on auto-pilot and oblivious to the level of their voices, door slamming, etc. We were schlepped into changing rooms, handed ridiculously small bags to hold our belongings, and handed thin bathrobes and flip flops of \"standard issue\" one-size-fits-all, that in no way was going to fit my 6 ft 5 in partner, who was trying to figure out how to fit his sized 14 feet into flip flops for a size 9 woman. : ) Our attendant seemed slightly baffled when we asked for a larger size. Things went further downhill when we were turned over to a very nice young man in jeans and a hoodie - who seemed as out of place in this spa as an eskimo in a swim suit. He was very nice and polite, but not the right vibe for a \"spa\" attendent. Things got really ugly when we were taken outside (nothing but our flimsy thin robes on a cold and wet February day) to stand outside waiting for our \"mud bath\" room to open up. The room itself was scary, dark, dank, smelly, and reminded me of a basement. The mud baths were not what I expected at all -- they are mud mixed with some other substance (reminded me of peat moss), and they just seemed really, really gross. All I could think about when I was sitting in them was how many other people had sat in these same baths since the last time the mud had been changed! Our teenaged attendent returned to the room with such frequency to ask if we were \"okay\" etc., that we only got maybe 2 min. at a time to \"relax\" which was hard to do because he also kept turning out this incredibly obnoxious window fan that sounded like a small jet engine. Our total time in the \"mud\" bath couldn't have been more than 15 min. and that was after we gave up some of our \"hot tub\" time to stay in the baths longer. Midway through our \"treatment\" the teenager appeared with some sort of goo in a bowl and asked us if we wanted the face mud - which he then awkwardly rubbed on our faces, making the whole experience seem even odder. We then were expected to share one shower head, which was ridiculous. The shower was pretty scummy looking, and the entire time we were showing, the teenager was on the other side of our flimsy shower curtain hosing down the mud bath room with a hose. Totally bizarre. We were then taken to another room for our \"heat wrap\" which was the biggest joke of all (I was expecting heated blankets at least), but no such thing. They have you lay on some old massage tables and just wrap you up in some old motel blankets. In fact, the teenager wasn't even going to do this for us (he thought we'd be too hot), but I insisted since we were paying for it! Being wrapped up in the blankets in the dark room might have been relaxing had the teenager and other employees not been standing a few feet away from the room chatting while we were trying to \"relax.\" We then went for a massage. I was holding out that maybe I would FINALLY get a chance to \"relax\" since we were away from the teenager, but no such luck. Within minutes of my massage beginning, and small toddler began shrieking in a nearby room. This went on for at least 5 minutes. The massage therapists seemed amused, but I wasn't, since I was there to RELAX and this was the least relaxing experience I've ever had relaxing anywhere! I had upgraded to the one hour massage, but the quality of the massage itself was below average. I was so frustrated by the time our \"spa\" experience was over that I was actually in tears. Because we stayed for 3 days, in the end our overall experience was decent. I give it a 4.5 for the mineral water quality, a 3.5 for the room, and a 2.5 for the spa experience. Would I go back? Yes, but only during the week when it is quieter, and I'd skip the groady mud baths entirely.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Walnut Creek, California", "Title": "\u201cFamily Get-Away\u201d", "Author": "L2meH", "ReviewID": "UR124935218", "Content": "I have been going to Golden Haven for many years.

Each unit has its own assigned parking spot - ours was right in front of our door. It was perfect so that we didnt have to worry about our car. Our favorite part of our stay was swimming in the mineral pool. It is very well kept. The water was clean and the pool area was spotless. It shows that this establishment takes the time to tend to the minor details. Its framework is a bit country cabin of the 70's but they've done a wonderful job sprucing it up so that it feels warm, fresh and inviting. We did not have time for the spa services but folks seemed to be enjoying them. Next time you visit calistoga, you may want to give Golden Haven a try. Its not the least expensive but its comparable to other hotels in the area. We fully expected it to be a dive but were very pleasantly surprised at how meticulously cared for this property is. We're definitely going back. Side note ~ the only suggestions we eould make to the hotel is to stck each room with a wine bottle opener and offer real creamer with your complimentary morning coffee.

I didn't think the smell was that bad, and you do get used to it after a bit. I would recommend going with another person. The peat moss in the mud really clings to your body and it can be tricky getting it all off by yourself. I recommend blasting it off with the hose rather than trying to shower, it's easier and more fun that way. Check their website for specials.

We found a coupon in our bed and breakfast nearby, and Golden Haven was very highly reviewed and seemed to be a legend in Callistoga. We are not by any means snooty spa-connoisseurs.... but this was the most ridiculous place we've ever been. Highlights, (or should I say lowlights...) *We were escorted into a room that looked like an old YMCA pool changing room that had a HUGE hole in the ceiling and asked to undress and slip into the mud bath. Instead of being given a locker/robe, there was one plastic lawn chair in the room for us to put all our winter clothes on, boots, bra, underwear, coats, etc. A nice guy who looked to be maybe a high school kid in jeans and a TShirt knocked to come in before our naked selves were even down into the mud.... so we hurried things up and plunged down and covered up our dangling bits. The kid in jeans then brings me a face mask that he asks to paint on to my face. I was trying not to laugh because he looked so uncomfortable! He then goes over to my husband and shows him the paintbrush of face mask and says, \"Dude, you want some too?\" We were then supposed to get out and shower after 10 minutes or so and then soak in a hot tub. The kid in jeans told us that the shower was a little tricky--- which we soon found out meant BOILING or FREEZING. We were trying to scrape the mud off ourselves and shower off in literally ice water (while naked under florescent light) when the kid in jeans comes back in and decides to hose down the room while we're showering together in the ice. (The shower has a curtain about as thin as notebook paper and about knee-level... no bending over is recommended!) Meanwhile, our clothes are still hanging off the lawn chair. After the kid in jeans leaves, we run over to the 'hot tub' which is water that has not been changed from every other couple that day. We were sitting in naked-couple-mud-water. Seriously. In extremely open view of the door, which the kid in jeans is hovering behind. Finally, still partially covered in mud and grossed out from the 'hot tub,' the kid in jeans puts a towel in the corner, so we hop out and wrap up in a towel, pick up all our winter clothes and personal belongings in our arms, and then make our way to another room where the kid in jeans says we're going to be given a heat wrap. He pulls the sheets apart of two cots and tells us to jump in. (We're wet, naked, and covered in a bed sheet when he comes back in.) He then puts a hotel blanket.... might have been velour in 1978, but now it's a matted old hotel blanket... and wraps it around us, puts a cold cloth on our eyes, cranks up some music, and tells us to relax. The music was hysterically bad-- so bad that we were CONVINCED we were on candid camera. Finally, after our 'wrap'... (a BLANKET wrap...!)... we were shown into the 'dressing room.' It was a SHOWER. like a YMCA shower!!!! Still wet, still covered in mud, and laughing so hard we were crying, we made our way back to our bed and breakfast. We have honestly NEVER laughed so hard together in our marriage... I guess that's a plus.

There was also renovation going on with about 10 construction workers working right out in front of the spa, which is fine, except that we hadn't been warned. We also weren't warned that we would have to WALK OUTSIDE in nothing but our PAPER THIN ROBES and walk THROUGH THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, up a flight of stairs in order to reach the massage room.

I recommend The Golden Haven Spa experience to anyone who lives life like us or to anyone else who is just looking to unwind and reconnect with mind, body, and spirit. Because it's such a jungle out there we frequently put our own health & wellness on the low priority list by taking care of others most of our working lives. A visit to Golden Haven at least 4-6 times per year allows us to continue taking care of others at this pace without going insane. So when you think about it for a second, taking care of others can only be acheived by taking care of yourself periodically. That's where Golden Haven Spa comes into play. You check-in, you're under their care from start to finish. No matter if you live local or far away, Golden Haven is the best place to go to de-stress and recharge your batteries. My wife and I live an hour away and don't have much time for long vacations, so we go to Golden Haven for our \"stay-cation.

Nice and private at all times, the gals were always respective asking if she can come in. The mud was hot and stinky but sooo soothing. Lime Iced water was all over to remind us to keep hydrated. The massages were great especially my 2nd day, Anett was superb concentrating on my areas I mentioned as my stress holding areas. We loved the pool area and were there for hours as all 3 pools were needed! A swimming pool set at 86, a hot tub with normal water set at 102 and a natural spring water hot tub at 108, SWEET!! We talked to a lot of interesting Americans and Canadians and enjoyed that relaxing time...The Golden Haven is great at what they do. I don't mind some young girls being happy at the desk or anywhere for that matter and laughing is great to hear so I can overlook others commenting on the loud desk area. It is the front desk! Our room was quiet and nicely decorated. We had our own parking space right in front of the room. We had a room with the jacuzzi and aside from the mineral water changing colors of the tub it was spotless. We almost cried at the thought of leaving this place. Enjoyed the neighborhood it was in, gave us a chance to walk in a neighborhood like at home and everyone was so friendly as we walked....must be all that mineral water they soak in!!! I liked that little envelopes were left out with the attendants names on it for tips that could be dropped off at the front desk at our convenience. I asked for a extra blanket for the room and got a comfy warm one delivered. Morning coffee was served at the office which kept hubby happy as I slept in a bit more.

The mud was very hot deeper down, but the attentive spa assistant helped to make sure that we were comfortable and also put a clay mask and cooling cloth on our faces. The feeling of being suspended in hot mud removed all of the tightness in my muscles! My husband could only take about 10 minutes of the treatment, but I stayed until I was instructed that it was time to hose down. After hosing down with a mineral water shower, we sat in a mineral water jacuzzi and drank the cold cucumber water solution, which we found refreshing. After this, we put on our robes and were escorted to the cool down room where we lay down and were covered with blankets, darkness and soothing music.

Neither one of us has been to the Napa area and we definitely have not been to a resort where you lay around in mud! =) We arrived around 11 in the morning after driving from SF, our room was ready when we arrived so we checked in. Since we booked last minute and were staying 2 days, the first day we just got a room (without any treatments) and the second we purchased the \"ultimate getaway\" package. The only room left was the cottage room so our rate was $150 and the second night @ $160 per person. Upon checking in, the woman who helped us was friendly and nice; very informative about the grounds and taught us how to adjust the water for a non-scalding temp. Our room was right in front of the pool area so we were able to look out to see how busy the pool and sun deck were before actually leaving our room; but we were also right in front of the 10 minute parking area so we heard every time someone parked and open/shut their car doors. Once in the room, the fiance headed to the complimentary water and the candy jar! Excellent choice of candies included gobbstoppers, twizzlers, taffy, etc. We decided to do some wine tasting around the area for the first day so we were out and about. The bed was comfy but was a bit too soft for my liking. Our TV was not working and once we told the lady at the front desk, she was prompt in fixing our problem. We had the mud bath and massage on the second day. The mud bath was interesting.....in a very good way but different from anything I've tried before. The mud is very hot like previous reviewers have said and the nice touch is that they allow you to take photos without being charged. If you do not have a camera, they can take a photo and you have the option to buy or not. The hose really did help with rinsing the mud off, and the whirlpool tub definitely added to the cleaning process. After that, we were shuffled out of the mud room and into the blanket wrap...I almost fell asleep. My massage was absolutely fabulous! It was my first massage and the masseuse definitely put me at ease with her gentle touch and it was helpful that she was describing what steps she were planning to take. My skin was so smooth after and I just felt like a noodle. Luckily, we had our room just steps away so we both went back to the room and took a nap.

It wasn't an overnight trip so we only used the hotel room for a shower and a quick nap. Please note that the mud bath is very hot and you do not have to put your whole body inside. There is a bit of a smell and feels yucky and weird at first but you get used to it. Not really sure how they clean the mudbath or if the heat kills any germs other people leave behind. You don't bring a bathing suit at the spa since you are naked throughout - of course they provide a robe for you to put on when you go in between rooms. There's cold water with lemon in all the rooms since you need to hydrate yourself. My husband thought it was relaxing - he fell asleep on both the mud bath and the blanket wrap. It didn't feel like we were there long enough for me to doze off. My friends, somehow got lucky and they were upgraded to a room with an adjoining room - we paid the same amount, but again we didn't spend the night so they didn't really get to take advantage of the room.

I decided to plan a spa day for my husband and I while we were in Napa (he had never been) and we chose the mud bath based on reviews on here and from friends. We drove up and my husband said \"this can't be right\"...referring to the motel look from the road. I was also shocked but said I was sure it would be better inside. This was not the case. It is not your typical spa, which may be fine for some people. They check you in like you are checking in to a motel. We were taken back to our mud room and the first thing we noticed was the overwhelming smell of the mud, it was foul! We are told to undress and how to climb in to the mud so we don't burn ourselves. The only thing we could think of was how many other people had been in here before us. Not a pleasant thought. We gamely went forward though. The mud was thick, chunky and hot. After sitting in there for about 10 minutes we were told it was time to shower. The shower is a old curtained off area with 1 shower head and 1 hose. While you are showering, the staff person is hosing down the mud in the room. Very strange. After showering it's time to go in the jacuzzi which looked old and not very clean. We stayed there for about 10 minutes and were told to put our robes on and come out to the cooling area. The robes were old, mismatched and very thread bare. They don't provide flip flops so we walked around bare foot trying not to think about what we were walking on. The cooling off consisted of 1 thin blanket, followed by a itchy wool blanket with the light dimmed. We were there for 25 minutes. Again, odd. And the walls are paper thin and you hear everything else that is going on outside. The minute we were out of the mud room, a new couple was escorted in. We had \"upgraded\" to a 1/2 hour massage, and this was also disappointing. My husbands' masseuse talked the whole time, the lights were on and it wasn't very romantic at all. Plus the woman I had hurt my shoulders so much I thought I might have to get another massage at home to correct what she had done/not done. Last step was a \"shower room\" which had a tiny shower, no garbage can, no fan and 1 tiny stool. The shower had industrial shampoo and conditioner. We quickly showered and raced out of there, ignoring the dirty q-tip on the floor. There was also no where to put the robes or towels, so they went on the floor. Overall, very disappointing but I guess you pay for what you get. This was by no means cheap, but also not the traditional spa pricing either.

We had a couple easy chairs (tres chic!) and we had a kitchenette which we used. Little chairs and tables outside our French doors - we used that too...had cockatils in evening and read paper/drank coffee in morning.

However on the day of arrival we were coming back from the tour of the Napa valley and were running late to the treatment. At 6 p.m. exaclty as we got into our car ( from the tour bus, where we had no telephone numbers), I dialed the place trying to tell them that we will be 10 mintues late. After being on hold for the same 10 minutes, I was rudely informed that it is after6 p.m and we will not get the treatement, because other people are booked after us. I suggested to shrten the treatment time for us, but it was not acceptble. With my phone still in my hand I waled into the reception area at 6:12 p.m. and was flatly refused the treatment. Moreover, I was told that they are not interested in my business and I can go elsewhere for lodging as well. Asking for manager - I was talking to the manager - asking for the owner - he was conviniently not available. We decided not to go and look for other lodging because it was getting dark, and we were on the road all day long. The staff did not tell us how to use any other amenities that were advertised on the hotel site. If she could through the keys into my face she would have done it. When we got to the room - what a disappontment that was: a Motel-6 decor, 50-60's plumbing, shower that barely sprinkles, no windows in the room, unless you want to open the shades of the entrance door that faces the parking, etc. We spent the night, but my weekend was ruined - I was looking forward to a relaxing time.

There is a bathtub in the room which has mineral water, and also two jacuzzis next to the swimming pool to soak in. I always watch for the Internet specials but find that the best value is to book a room, and then have a massage only. I've tried the mudbaths, and other treatments and don't feel they relax me as much as a massage. Just spent a couple nights by myself - its a quiet, safe place for a woman to spend time. Found a couple things that were rather annoying with this visit. When I booked my massage I told the front desk gal that I wanted only half an hour massage. Instead she charged me for an hour which I decided to take - even though she said she could credit my Visa. While I wasn't upset about the mix-up, I was disappointed with my massage. The gal talked continually, did not focus on my body, used cold lotion, and did not pay attention to the areas I wanted/did not want her to work on. When I left my treatment, I felt my $85.00 was wasted. I have been very happy with the other massage therapists I've had on previous visits to Golden Haven. I also was disappointed with my room accomodations. The mattress felt like straw, and the pillows were lumpy. The airconditioner was very loud, and when I opened windows for ventilation, you could hear the other airconditioners from other units during the night. The cable was down for over an hour, and it appeared there were other problems with the cable service. My room had a small refrigerator. Remember to fill up with goodies from a store that is outside of Calistoga because the market is very expensive. There are only vending machines on the premises.

We loved the mud bath so we decided to try out the hotel and have another round of mud bath plus an hour long massage. When we first went there, we found it a little strange that the place is in a residential area surrounded by homes and a high school. We arrived late night ~10pm and we couldn't go to the jacuzzi since they close the pool area around 10pm. So we decided to take a bath, but the water in our bathroom wasn't warm enough. It could be because it was a cold day or because the pipes are a little old. The bathroom I found to be a bit chilly. Other than that the room was spacious and clean plus we had an extra bedroom with a queen bed which we didn't use. The area with the bed stayed warm since the wall heater was close by to the bed. Each room gets one parking spot right in front of the room. We tried out the pool area in the morning and we were 2 of the 4 people there. Swam in the pool then warmed up more in the 2 jacuzzis that they had. The mud bath and massage was very relaxing and nice. The spa attendant was very professional and if we asked for more time in the hot mineral water bath they let us stay a little longer. The mud is a neat experience. We found that when we were rinsing off the mud off of us, we couldn't get warm water...later on we realized that in the spa area if we turn it to cold we got warm water.

Nice grounds with fountains, sunbathing on roof top, pool with covered, gated area. Cozy areas with tables, chairs, well landscaped for sitting, relaxing, sipping your wine or just chatting with others. Who went, two adults looking for a nice, quiet weekend in wine country. Was recommended by a friend to try the couple\u2019s mud baths. We spent two nights of quiet and restful sleep. Room: #24, King bed with in room Jacuzzi. Nice sized room, large, comfy bed with lots of pillows, two comfy chairs with a table, fridge and nice sized bathroom. The windows all opened for fresh air, and the air conditioner worked nicely, although was slightly noisy. The room had a wonderful smell of lemons and other spices, which actually was also the smell we had in the spa. I ended up buying some of the bath salts and now they sit on my tub at home to remind us of the wonderful time we had. The entire resort was very clean, we saw people walking around checking the grounds frequently! Mud baths: we had a wonderful time. I must say I was a little apprehensive when I saw the baths and the mud as it looked a little daunting. But our spa person, Kim, was wonderful, and explained everything to us. Here\u2019s how it goes: you arrive and check in at the spa, which is in the back of the resort. Everyone was super friendly, asking if we\u2019d been there before, (we hadn\u2019t) and giving us any information we needed. There is fresh chilled lemon water available and the entire spa smells of lemons!! We were called for our time (8pm) and Kim took us into the main mud bath area, which also had the showers and our Jacuzzi mineral bath. She leaves you after explaining what to do and we are left to disrobe and enter the mud. My husband and I were laughing the entire time as it is quite an experience to squish yourself into the mud. You slide onto the top then kind of wriggle down, it is quite warm and you then scoop the mud on top of yourself, what a sensation. Very warm but not uncomfortable!! Kim knocks and after we say ok, she enters, and explains we will be in the bath for 15 mins, she gives us each a cup of ice water, covers our face with a cooling mask and puts a washcloth on our head. We were in for a very relaxing 15 mins and were surprised how quickly it went. Then we are told to head into the shower and we had a great time hosing each other off (in private of course!!). As we are taking our shower Kim prepared our Jacuzzi bath and left us to sink ourselves into more, luxurious relaxation. We are given salts to sprinkle into the water if we wanted, and we did, after relaxing for quite awhile. Too soon a knock comes and we are told to put our robes on (provided by the spa) and follow Kim to the blanket room where we are wrapped in soft, felt and then wool blankets. There we are left with a cool washcloth to our foreheads to listen to wonderful soothing music as we finish our soothing hour at the spa!! The Golden Haven was easy to find, in a great location within walking distance to downtown Calistoga. There it is a quant little town with little boutique stores and some very nice restaurants and bars.

I loved the fact that the spring water was available in the bathroom showers. The swimming pool and Jacuzzi were also clean and remained at a comfortable temperature. A friendly attendant would come and knock at your door fifteen minutes prior; to escort you to your mud bath/massage appointments. The staff members were very helpful and respectful at all times. One suggestion is that in the future the resort should consider a 24 hour Deli, Restaurant, or Snack Shack for the resort guests. It would also be nice if there was a game room with video games, fuse ball, ping pong or pool tables. A soundproof entertainment room of course, so that the guest will not be distracted or disrupted by the noise; but to be at peace and quiet environment. I highly recommend this resort to all people. The Golden Haven is a heavenly place of piece of quiet, great mud baths and body massages for an affordable price. I will recommend this resort to my family and friends.

I wasn't sure what to expect, having heard tales from others of attendants shoveling hot mud over you while you lay in the mud, and then being sprayed w/power hoses to get the mud off. Nothing could be further from the truth! The attendant tells you what to do, and then leaves you to get in/out of the mud while she's out of the room. She puts cool towels on your forehead, applies a soothing face mask, and explains what the mud is all about and answers questions. After around 15 min in the mud, she returns to tell you to get out, rinse off (there's a curtained-off area, with 2 showers - one for each of you, with a stone bench to sit on if you like) and then you hop in to the jacuzzi, where you relax while drinking cool lemon water. From there, go to the cool-down room, where you're swaddled like a baby in a room with candles, a gurgling water feature, and new age music (which I would normally hate, but didn't mind becuase I was so relaxed). We had 30 minute massages, which were fabulous! I recommend Marcia - who massaged my husband. I think he got a better treatment than I did... though I was happy w/my masseuse (forgot name). We were given a mesh bag to keep our clothes/shoes clean/dry, and flip-flops to walk around in. This seems contrary to what a previous poster mentioned. Golden Haven isn't the top of the line place, but for $108 each (check out online coupons), the 90 minute experience was a great value and a completely fun, relaxing experience.

Not only was the drive to Golden Haven a beautiful one but it was also very easy to get to. We passed several wineries and quaint little shops along the way. When we arrived we were greeted with kind faces and a laid back relaxing atmosphere. When it came time for our mud bath my fianc\u00e9 became nervous. Our attendant was perfect; he was very respectful and helped put us at ease being that it was our first time in a mud bath. Once the mud bath was over we showered and soaked in a Jacuzzi all in the same fully tiled room. After the mud bath, shower and Jacuzzi soaking we were able to rest in a quaint candle lit room to rest and cool off. We were then greeted by our Massage Therapists. Our Therapists truly made the evening relaxing and wonderful. As a massage therapist myself I greatly appreciated not only the atmosphere but the professionalism of both therapists and the connection they made with both my fiance and myself. Did I mention that my fianc\u00e9 proposed to me before our treatments? Well maybe it WAS my fianc\u00e9 that really made the experience what it was for me but Golden Haven Inn and its staff also had a big part in making our weekend a truly memorable one. We will definitely be returning to Golden Haven in the future and I recommend to everyone that you consider the mud bath, it was truly divine.

Thankfully, we were charged a pro-rated promotional rate. However, the relatively inexpensive price was no consolation for very poor service. In fact, after the entire experience we still felt as though we had been \"ripped off.\" We did not know what to expect with the mud bath, as it was our first experience. This part of our spa treatment seemed very rushed. Our attendant seemed somewhat friendly, but seemed to push us through each of the stages of the mud bath, mineral soak and blanket wrap as though we were in a race. The actual soak time in the mud was about 10 minutes, which we heard, after some research, is probably the shortest soak time alloted amongst all the other spas in Calistoga. During the blanket wrap, we were supposed to retire or even nap in relaxing silence. And despite a sign posted right outside the room requesting quiet, we heard loud laughing and talking the whole time, which made it extremely difficult to fall asleep let alone relax. Our half hour massage was probably the best part of our experience, although that is not saying much. The massage therapists greeted us and bid us farewell very hastily. However, the massage was fairly good, but definitely not near the best we've had. (Perahps we are a bit biased in this opinion because we were already pretty upset by this point.) Overall, we had a very disappointing experience, especially since we had been looking forward to it for a while. We both felt a lot LESS relaxed coming out of the spa than we did going in! We kept joking that what we needed now was a massage since we felt a bit stressed! We would definitely not recommend this spa to anyone. It is much more worth your while to pay a little extra to get much better service. After our very disheartening experience, we went shopping around at several other spas in Calistoga. It seemed like common knowledge among the locals that Golden Haven has a reputation for providing rushed, unfriendly service and for \"herding\" their large numbers of customers through their spa experiences. In some cases, all we had to mention was that we had an extremely poor spa experience and people guessed exactly where we were talking about. That is pretty bad! If friendly, welcoming, accomodating service is essential to you to have a good experience, please do not waste your time here!

In fact, we enjoyed walking around the neighborhoods and taking the short (about 8 blocks) walk to the downtown area of Calistoga. The spa was fabulously relaxing.

The facility was very clean and we had a good time joking with the staff. We had a spa package for two and the mud bath/Jacuzzi room was very nice. The young man that attended to us was very nice and always respectful of us. The blanket room was great for a quick nap before our massage. The ladies that gave us our massages were wonderful. Very attentive and absolutely catered to our needs. It was all we could do to walk back to our rooms when it was over. When we wanted to go to town for something to eat they were more than helpful in pointing out some great places to eat. Which is all of Calistoga!

The natually heated water from the hot springs in your shower, tub, and sink was a treat. We sat in our big jacuzi tub and watched TV for hours. We did the couples mud bath, spa, facial, blanket wrap, and massage. THis experience was heavenly and a much needed stress reliever. It was great that we could go through the whole experience together and not be apart for any of it. The room and property were not what you would call luxury or five star.

We were excited about experiencing a mud bath as a \"COUPLE\". I had seen there website and the pictures looked like it was a nice spa & resort offering a wonderful experience, but looks can be deceiving!! We booked our mud bath and upgraded our spa package to include a mini massage and facial (big mistake). At six o'clock we were greeted by our attendant. A nice girl but not very professional. Once in our robes, she escorted us into our mud bath room. It was awful!! It smelled VERY bad, the room was run down with old mats, old pipes and old everything else. We were told to hurry in to our mud baths so we can be in there longer. Our attendant kept coming in and out and telling us what our next step was. No privacy whatsoever. After our mud bath, she had us get into a shower which was surrounded by old hanging curtains. She came back in and started her clean up duty, as we showered. Then we were told to get into the mineral bath tub (old rusted jacuzzi) as she re-entered our room and proceeded to hose down the shower curtain. Not very romantic. My husband and I were so anxious to get this over with we did not even have a chance to enjoy each other. Once we were in our blanket room she turned off the light and closed the door so we can have some quiet time. But needless to say, right out side our room they have signs that says \"Quiet Please\" it was everything but that. Everyone in the hallway was laughing and talking so LOUD that we had trouble relaxing during this time. Finally we had 2 nice massage therapists take us upstairs to a room where we finally had a nice massage followed by a FACIAL. Beware: Do Not have a facial as you will leave with a BAD Sour Milk Smell on your face for hours. They used some kind of rose/whip cream treatment that left a horrible smell on my face. I could not wait to warn others NOT TO COME TO GOLDEN HAVEN SPA & RESORT for a \"COUPLES MUD BATH OR ANYTHING ELSE!! You will be sorry!!

Its a lovely spring day so why not treat ourselves! We went to 3 different spas with no luck. Our last stop was Golden Haven. Not only did they fit us in they had a room! What a room it was lovely! The french doors to the entry of our room was just the start! We had 2 double beds, high ceilings a complete kitchenette! Sky light that led to the bathroom. The room was gorgeous! That evening we went for our treatment for our mud bath and massage. Now I must tell that I have been a therapist for 20yrs. The gentle and loving way they catered to me was unbelievable! They where right on time. My mud bath was out of this world! All my tension just faded in the heat of the mud. Followed by a whirl pool soak. Then came the body wrap! Oh My God! I thought I was in Heaven! When Paul took me up for my massage I got on the table. Paul was terrific! Not only was he curtious with the draping it was one of the best massages I had recieved in a very long time! I believe Golden Haven has the best staff most nurturing people I have met in a long time! It is nice to know that there are people out there that still care for the humane race.

We found ourselves at the Golden Haven Reception Counter, we were \"walk-in\" customers but we were treated like royalty. Barry, not only found a suite for us, we received every service available at the times we wanted. This was absolutely amazing, as we had already stopped at three other spa resorts and could only receive one or none of the services we wanted. I have always been a skeptic as to mud bathing, however my assistant, Theresa, made the experience comforting and secure, to my surprise like floating on warm fluffy clouds. My aunt, Minda was a first timer as well and she was so pleased with the transforming therapies that she will return every year with her visits to California, her words,\"I've found the fountain of youth, the best gift anyone could ever receive.\" The massage therapists, the staff were very courteous and caring, making sure to provide us with every comfort. Our facials, unbelievable, what a service, more like a circular body massage, so impressive. I am a WorldMark/Interval International/Trendwest Owner and I must say this has equalled if not surpassed the personal care and courtesy we received at Golden Haven Spa.
