This hotel (if you can call it that) is a JOKE! 4 of us (women) Booked through Thomas cook, we were told the hotel was 2 stars and it looked nice! On arrival the staff were very rude and unhelpful! We got given room '206' which was on the 2nd floor. When walking up to our room the hotel looked like a building site, walls were falling apart, random materials lying around and workmen all over the place. Bits of carpet sticking up every where-one on our corridor which i actually tripped and fell over on the second day! When opening the door to our room we were in shock! Four single beds crammed in to the smallest space imaginable! The beds were hard and uncomfortable with random stains on the sheets and some of the pillows. There were random white stains all over the floor too. Only one of the wall lights worked and it was hanging off-not exactly safe! There was chunks of flakey paint all over the floor as it was crumbling from the ceiling, you would expect this to at least be hoovered and cleaned up before new guests arrive!! The bathroom was worst of all! It was tiny and the stench in there was horrendous, smelt like someone had died in there! The sink was covered in hairs and filthy before we had even used it! Shower was tiny, freezing cold and the water leaked all over the bathroom floor! There was no cupboard space, just one wardrobe between all 4 of us and it only had one coat hanger in! We had one small bathroom mirror to share between four girls which was a nuisance when trying to get ready! The door to our room also didn't shut properly, you had to actually keep it locked with the key just to shut it and even then it wasn't very secure-could easily be forced open! The room was also freezing, it had one tiny radiator by the front door and there was a terrible draft coming in from the window, and of course-no spare blankets! Breakfast was included in the price which we thought was great until we tried it on the first morning! It simply consisted of a hot drink (crappy tasting coffee or tea) and a stale rock hard bread roll with a choice of choc spread or jam! To top all of this off, when packing up to leave the room on our last day we realized \u00a3100 had been stolen from one of our purses out of our hand luggage (no safe etc was provided to keep valuables in). Very upset and angry, we approached the reception to explain what had happened and they couldn't care less! We got no apology, they simply asked the cleaning staff about it and they said nothing-of course you're not going to admit to stealing money from a customer are you!!! I can't even understand what they were doing in our room when we weren't there as it certainly wasn't ever cleaned, all they did was leave one fresh towel on one of our beds and that was it! This was such a shame as Rome was such a beautiful lovely place and we found everyone else to be polite and friendly. I have stayed in far better accommodation for a lot less! I am not fussy and am quite happy to stay in basic accommodation but it should at least be clean and tidy on arrival and you certainly don't expect to have your valuables stolen! All i can say is it's lucky the rest of us didn't leave any money in the room as I'm sure they would have taken that too! Do yourself a big favor and stay in ANY other hotel than The Acropolis as it really was the worst hotel I have ever seen and stayed in. In my opinion it's not fit to be open to the public, especially rated at 2 stars!!!!", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cOne of the Worst Hotel In ROME - Hotel Acropoli\u201d", "Author": "sandra N", "ReviewID": "UR124001140", "Content": "\u2022 The booking was for a double bed and we were assigned a room with five beds \u2022 When the receptionist changed us to another bedroom, it was in the same conditions but with four single beds \u2022 I told the receptionist that the room had nothing to do with what was advised by Hotel Reservation staff at the airport in rome. \u2022 As these were stained walls, bad lighting, bad smell in room and bathroom and he said bluntly that it was all we have take or leave it. \u2022 At the left side of Acropoli, there is another hotel that is 2 stars, I guess corresponded those rooms, if sent to through the front door that is on the left of the reception, I think awaiting them the same \u2022 The room smelled like an ashtray even though I requested for a smoke free room. \u2022 The entire place looks rundown, worn-out and in very poor maintenance conditions. \u2022 Suppose to have wireless internet in the room, but it only works in the lobby \u2022 I do not recommend unless you enjoy sleeping on a trash can! \u2022 You can even invite a prostitute through the window without even leaving your room. \u2022 The groups of shady characters made it scary to walk the street after dark. \u2022 This HOTEL probably be the worst hotel in ROME and under HOTEL RESERVATION LIST at the Airport and BOOKING.Com * Never recommend anyone to book through HOTEL RESERVATION Desk at the Airport in Rome, they cheat people by lying. \u2022 Shame!

Hotel Reservation Desk informed us that the cost for the Double occupancy is Euro 37 per night. Booked room for 2 nights and did not realise what we were getting into. We paid Euro 60 (out of total cost of euro 74) and the lady informed that upon check out I need to pay the balance of AED 14 for 2 nights at the Hotel. There was something fishy. Upon check-in the room was not upto the mark as listed above so we refused to spend the night. Approached the Hotel Reservation Desk near Termini Station for a refund or another hotel and the Lady at the desk said we can re-book in another hotel but we cannot waive of the Booking cost (its not refundable - so we lost Euro 60) SO IN SIMPLE THE COST OF THE HOTEL IS EURO 7 PER NITE FOR THE ROOM and NOT EURO 37 as stated. EURO 30 is thier Booking charges. This clearly shows how the Hotel Reservation Desk at Rome Airport fleece you.

We're all in our early 20s and found the hotel to be suitable to our needs, but definitely wouldn't recommend it if you are looking to book with a family or more than 2-3 nights. I'll break down this review for easier reading. It is a long review, so be warned. The information that is presented might prove to your advantage, however. First Impression The first impression of the hotel is that it is located on a side street amidst a number of restaurants, internet cafes, take-aways and other hotels. The street itself is just like any other regular street you'd find, except that during the night time it becomes exceptionally noisy (if you happen to have a room which faces this street) due to the restaurant and roads being busy). The reception is clean enough and has a nice vaulted ceiling, giving a good first impression, but the rest of the hotel isn't as inviting. The Acropoli Hotel is also adjoined to another hotel named Hotel Georgina which resides within the top 2 floors of the 5 story building. Rooms Our room was very basic and consisted of 4 beds, 2 bedside cabinets, 1 table, a chair, a shower and a ceiling fan. We expected this for the price and it being a 2 star hotel, but what we didn't expect was the decor of the room and the quality of the bedding etc. The walls are a dirty white and have marks on them, which could possibly have been made from people putting their feet on the wall whilst laying in bed etc. It wasn't very clean, and looked quite tatty. The mattress on the beds are, I can only describe as, very thick foam and not very comfortable at all. The pillows are also very thin and not very comfortable either. One of my friends staying in the room did ask for an extra pillow and was given one, but when another friend asked he was turned away at reception. The room included 2 European plug sockets which we used quite a lot to charge our iPods and phones. There isn't any TVs but that didn't bother us much. The shower in the morning was refreshing but the bathroom layout is something to be desired. The shower faces the toilet, and sprays over the toilet roll holder which can be a problem but as long as the toilet cover is down and the toilet roll is withdrawn into the holder, it's fine. The lack of a matt on the floor meant that the tiling become incredibly slippy after the shower as well, so take care and put a used towel on the floor. The shower itself was refreshing and hot water wasn't a problem. Location The location of the hotel is quite good and is only a couple of minutes walk away from Termini station, which was the main reason we chose the hotel in the first place. It's also a 2 minute walk in the other direction to the biggest church devouted to the Virgin Mary (Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore), plus other sites such as the Spanish Steps are in easy walking distance. Next to the Santa Maria Maggiore there is also a fountain which we used every day to refill water bottles. There are many take-aways, internet points, a launderette, a supermarket and a couple of restaurants right on the doorstep of the hotel. We found the take-aways closer to Termini station to be better, but stayed away from them when we could. The supermarket offers a lot of variety, including fresh bread, fruit and a lot of things that we used to make our own meals. The two restaurants directly adjacent to the hotel were buzzing after about 6pm every night and they stay open most nights until around 2am. We found this to be a bit of a nuisance since we had to keep the window open at night time due to the heat, and the noise was sometimes unbearable (including the noise of the roads). We also saw a lot of street peddlers trying to sell their wares to people sitting outside to eat, and there was many people playing instruments and then asking for money. Beware, the area seems to crawl with these people after dark. We also saw at least 3 prositutes taking clients into the hotel opposite as well, but thankfully never saw any enter our hotel. Staff The female receptionists at the hotel are very friendly, but the male ones are not. The males are usually on the desk at night time and seemed to have contempt for us for no apparent reason. As said, the females were very friendly. The cleaning staff seemed to clean our rooms after breakfast (the cleaning staff also serve breakfast) and on the first floor our room was done between 9-10am. Breakfast itself is served 7:30-9:30am, consisting of a bread roll, french bread (in packets, like crispy little slices of toast), chocolate and a fruit spread. A choice of water, coffee, tea and hot chocolate are available. There is no juice choices. The cleaners bring fresh towels each morning but only change bedding if you take it off the bed and throw it on the floor, otherwise they just remake the bed. Services The hotel did offer free wi-fi when we first arrived but within a day of us having access to it, the password was changed. When we asked them about it, they just said the wi-fi was for the office only which struck us as strange. Nevertheless, we didn't get to use it again and the hotel doesn't offer standalone PCs to connect to the internet either. It isn't much of a problem, there's plenty of internet cafes around the hotel. The problem with the cafes, however, is that they tend to be filled with the street peddlers that sell their goods and thus it's not a very clean environment (I'm writing from one now). Overall Overall I would give the hotel a 1/5. For staying in the hotel to sleep it does its job, providing a bed and safe enough area to store your things and rest, but for anything more it's better off looking elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend this place for a stay longer than 3 nights, and definitely not if you're travelling with family or are hoping for a romantic getaway. Spend a bit more, you'll thank yourself for it. As with a lot of the other reviews, the only thing this place has going for it is the location and (maybe) the price. We got the hotel at a relatively cheap price but for 10 nights, staying here was a major drag. It's just lucky we are young lads and had each others company and we out and about a lot, otherwise it would've been a whole other story. Any way, I hope you find this review helpful. I've been as honest as I can, and everything said isn't biased because I'm a snob etc. Just giving my opinion on the hotel, and I would stay here again but not for more than 3 nights. As said in the title, don't expect any thrills and you won't be too disappointed.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNot as bad as some of the reviews.\u201d", "Author": "Siobhan186338", "ReviewID": "UR115060430", "Content": "Me and my partner just arrived back yesterday from a four night stay in this hotel. When we first arrived in Rome, we were very happy to find that there was a coach service which took us straight from Ciampino airport to Termini station. The coach company was called Terravision and only charged us 4 Euros per person for the trip. Once we had got off the coach, we used our map to find the way to the hotel which was only 2 roads and a 2 minute walk away. We found it very easily. Upon arriving, we checked in easily and quickly by providing proof of our reservation and our passports for their records (they gave them straight back!) and went up to our room. It was on the first floor and the first room. We did use the lift which was a bit scary as it didn't seem too secure but we found this quite funny. The room was very basic. Two single beds disguised as one, a wardrobe, a table and a small bathroom with a built in shower. It wasn't the cleanest of all rooms and there was some hair left in the bathroom but it was as we expected with the price paid. There isn't any air conditioning which we knew before we had booked it after doing some research. It was very hot due to it being the summer season but we went out and got a fan from a local shop on our first night for 21 Euros and this lasted through the holiday. The location is perfect for seeing Rome. The Colosseum was within a twenty minute walk as well as the Fountain Di Trevi and the Spanish Steps. The Vatican was a bit further out but we reached it easily by getting a tube from Termini station. It was only five stops on the Metro line with a ticket costing only 1 Euro! (A big surprise to us being Londoners). There are a lot of restaurants nearby which cater for all tastes at quite reasonable prices. There is an ice cream shop across the road, two internet/phone shops and a launderette. There is also a sex shop across the road which is within view but not so obvious as to make it something that the kids would pick up on. Breakfast is served in the morning between 7.30 and 9.30. We only had this once as it was a bit early for us and it's as basic as you can get. Two bits of freeze dried bread and some rolls with an option of butter, jam or nutella. Not the worst thing in the world if you need something to eat but you wouldn't choose it over the options provided by the local restaurants. You do need to hand your keys into reception when you go out which did strike us as a bit strange and we tried to avoid doing it if possible by walking out without the receptionist spotting us. And there are also a lot of school groups as this seems to be their main choice of hotel. They can be loud and there were often a lot of kids hanging around in the hallways but it is something that comes with the price you pay and fortunately, whilst we were there, there were no particularly loud groups that went on through the night. We were also on the back part of the hotel, away from the main street, so i'm sure we avoided a lot of the noise. The beds were quite comfortable with decent sheets, blankets and pillows. The undersheet didn't seem to be changed every day but i can't be certain. There were fresh towels provided everyday. All in all, we were both very happy with our stay and believed it deserved a better review than the ones it has been given. Yes, it is one of the most basic hotels you will find but this is reflected in the price. If you want a short trip in Rome close to all the sites and the local transport then i would definitely recommend this hotel. Just make sure you bring a fan!

It seems to have improved since last year (judging from previous reviews). The room was small, we had two twin beds put together to make a queen size bed, and a third twin bed on the side, which was great to lay out clothes and not have them crammed in my suitcase. There were no tv, radio, nor phone, but all that was a plus for me and my husband as we had time to talk to each other and enjoy each other's company. We were in the room only to rest and sleep, which became hard to do once teenage groups came to stay. It sounded like they were throwing each other against the walls! Running in hallways, screaming, and slamming doors. I tried to be patient considering it might be the first time they were ever out of their homes, but I did mention it to the front desk. They said they would talk to the teachers. I never travel without my earplugs, which helped a great deal. The noise level seems to be an issue throughout Europe, at least for me, so I knew what to expect. Also, I figured if we were getting a low cost hotel, we had to expect things like this. The cleanliness of the room was acceptable, we got clean towels everyday and when we asked for more, the only person at the front desk gave us the keys to the storage, so we could also get toilet paper. We also had plenty of blankets and pillows, and the drapes in the window were nice. The window was also new. There were two mirrors, one in the bathroom and the other outside the bathroom. We had 4 electrical outlets, and plenty of lights. The bathroom was small, with the toilet paper dispenser directly under the shower!! hahahaha Somehow the paper stayed dry! At least there was a shower curtain and hot water with a nice pressure, unlike other Rome hotels I've stayed at! The bathroom was clean, in good working order. The floors did get very wet after a shower, but they were not slippery and the bathroom was very clean every day when we came back after sightseeing. Security?? Questionable. We checked in and then left for dinner, and we had to leave the keys at the front desk. Later we returned and asked for our key, and the new attendant didn't ask for our ID or anything, she just handed us the keys. It would take someone very little effort to observe when you come and go, then ask for your key and have a ball in your room with your valuables!! By the way, our valuables were always safe. Breakfast is very basic: a piece of bread, two toasts, jam, butter, and nutella. Coffee, chocolate or tea and that is all you need to get you going on your day's adventure and eat and drink yummier things out and about! The best thing about the hotel was its location. 2 block walk to the Termini station, where the train from the airports ends its route, and where you can take 2 metro lines and many buses. Termini station is also great for shopping and dining at every budget. There are many places to eat around the hotel, including a place across the street where they have a nice variety of gelattos. There are a couple of nice pubs within a 4 block walk from the hotel and walking late at night was very safe. The street where the hotel is located was shut down due to construction, so there was minimal noise. The staff at this place was friendly and I will definitely pay less to stay at this hotel than to stay at a 4 star hotel (by US standards) where I'm going to give away the money I could be spending on food, sightseeing and souveniers.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mumbai", "Title": "\u201cThird class hotel\u201d", "Author": "suvi_15", "ReviewID": "UR62464836", "Content": "Staying on railway platform is much better than staying in this hotel.

The receptionist wasn't too friendly, but I found the old stairs and elevator beautiful. Not too sure if the elevator is to be trusted though, it dangerously shaked and made odd noises at times. There was a beat up closet in our room and some of the lamps were broken. The bathroom is on another level and there is a pitiful excuse for a shower in there. We had a friend with us who is just over 2 metres and he had a hard time trying to catch some water in there. The showerhead is terrible indeed. The toilet is fine as long as you only take a pee in there, but we will get to that later. The street the hotel is on is very noisy, and one night, at around 3 AM, we heard terrible screams from a woman as if she was being killed. This lasted for about 30 minutes, then we heard her boyfriend or husband comforting her in English. She probably got lost, and this is a bad area to get lost in. Also saw a guy jacking off in plain daylight a few times. Must be one of the town idiots. There is a curfew. You can try to sneak in through the hotel next door which is connected, try not to get caught. They will give you some problems. We went down to have breakfast on the very first morning but quickly realized we had made a mistake. We nicknamed the 'breakfast', a brickfast. Everything you got was a loaf of bread which was hard as rock and you could easily break your teeth on. It came with a little package of disgusting crackers and some jam. So if you do decide to stay at this hotel, steer away from the breakfast. It really is terrible. One of the beds was broken and had a big dent in the middle. Might be comfortable for a dog or a cat, but not for a human. We had to use our own towels as they would not refresh them. The beds were cleaned daily, however. One time the hotel staff came knocking on our door, saying we had to stop throwing beer bottles and other stuff out of the window. Was quite appalled they said and maintained we did this. I do not know who it was, but it was not us. I told them this, and they got angry with me and wanted to kick us out. In the end I managed to calm them down, but every single time we passed the clerk we were greeted with suspicion and hatred. Right. Now for the problems we experienced with the toilet in our room. After 4 or 5 days, it broke. The water and anything in it would stay in the bowl and the toilet wouldn't properly flush. This all happened after a friend did his business there. Surely, he laid a right big coconut in there, but on a regular toilet it should just flush. This is not what happened to us there. It stuck. It took about an hour to get it to go down the drain, all the while severely testing my abdominal muscles as I was laughing so hard at the other fellow's misfortune. When the thing finally cleared the toilet and was out of our sight we thought everything was fine. But thereafter, everytime somebody flushed the toilet, the water crept higher and higher, with the water eventually being just a few centimetres below the seat. Remnant of human fecal matter and toilet paper floated in there, as if it was an aquarium. The smell was very disgusting, and everyone who has business in the bathroom would pinch their noses as to not smell the horrible odor in there. To make sure it did not enter the rest of the room, we laid wet towels under the bathroom door. The horror culminated in the very last hour of our stay there. We had already packed our suitcases and were about to return to the Netherlands, when I decided to take a pee. Apparently, my friends shouted at me and warned me not to flush, but I did not hear a thing. So I stood there, unzipped my trousers relieved myself in that open sewer that called itself a toilet. I flushed and casually turned around to walk back into the room, when suddenly I heard a noise which was a mix between a whale spout and a waterfall. I turned around and saw the toilet literally spitting out water and overflowing as if it was alive and being shot at. We quickly gathered up the last of our towels and barricaded the water and everything that was in it from entering our room. We opened the door one last time and the bathroom looked like a warzone.

Before I list the things that were wrong, I am a well-travelled woman (I've stayed all throughout Central America, Asia, North America and Europe in a wide range of hotels, hostels and homes) and this is the first time I have ever been so appaulled by a place to write a review. THE GOOD - Upon arriving there, it was only 5 minute walk away from the train station and metro, my boyfriend and I noticed that there was construction all on the outer face of the hotel. It is in a fairly loud neighbourhood as it is and at first we just figured that it would help keep us out of the hotel room for as long as possible. The receptionist at first was very kind and as we got our key for our room I noticed that it looked like there were only 3 or so other rooms being rented at the time. THE BAD - We then crammed our luggage into the elevator (which was very unstable and shook as we went to the second floor) and walked along the hallway to our room. We at first couldn't even open our door as the key was faulty and had to be pryed into the keyhole to work. The door did not close properly and seemed to be warped and could be easily broken. At first look of our room we noticed they stuffed 4 beds into our one room (we were told we got a double room) and the room seemed to be not very clean. The room was actually not even level... either the room wasn't or the bathroom, I still am not sure which one it was. The bathroom which \"has a shower\" had a pitiful excuse of a shower which was just a drain in the bathroom floor with a shower curtain hung on the ceiling. It seemed dirty in there and I knew that if I had to shower I would be showering with my flip flops on. Considering all the free rooms avaliable, it amazed me that the lady had chosen to put us facing the construction workers which meant we couldn't open our window all the way (as they were working right outside it) and since there was no A/C it was ridiculously hot in there. My boyfriend and I decided to just lie on the beds and read/play cards until we were hungry enough for dinner (we arrived in the evening but had ate on the train). I was wearing shorts (while he was wearing jeans) and about an hour after lying on the bed my legs started getting bites and became incredibly itchy. The bedsheets seemed to have bed bugs or something on them so we left to go get something to eat while we waited for our travel agency to open in Canada. We went down the marble (at least I think it was marble) staircase and I was shocked to see cigarette butts on the ground. The hotel has obviously had no upkeep as it could be a great hotel with some TLC. My boyfriend decided he needed something to drink and after having the machine eat 4 euros, we went to complain to the receptionist. As soon as we started trying to tell her the machine was broken and if there was any way to get our money back, she 'couldn't speak English.' The receptionist who spoke PERFECT English to us earlier. We ended up leaving frustrated and cranky, and once we got a hold of our travel agent they did wonders for us --- they are still trying to refund the 4 remaining nights we had there but they found us a hotel that for the same price but was amazing (it had A/C, TV, a phone, clean sheets, and a bath tub! Yipee :P ) When checking out, the (now man) receptionist asked us if there was anything wrong. My boyfriend just said it wasn't up to our standards but I figured it there are bugs in the room that they need to be sprayed so as I was saying that I had gotten bit all over my legs from lying on the bed he rudely said that \"if I have a reason to complain then I can come back and see him tomorrow\" --- As if I was coming back tomorrow!

The wardrobe was not too clean inside either. The shower was old looking but clean and servicable but the water went all over the floor tiles and was very dangerous. The walls looked as though they hadnt been painted in decades and the floor looked as though that hadnt been hoovered for weeks. The curtains wouldnt have looked out of place in a D.S.S hostel (believe me, I've seen them!) and when my husband tried to open them, the pole fell down on him! There was only one mirror and that was in the shower room so we had to keep moving it to the nearest working plug socket every morning so me and my 14 year old daughter could get ready to go out. There were no pictures on the walls, no TV, no tea/coffee facilities. The walls are really thin and you can hear everything going on in the other rooms. It is very shabby.

When I got there I discovered that it was mixed, although the only guys left that day - the Hotel staff tried to justify putting me in there, by stating that they wouldn't put anyone else in there ... lo' and behold, 2 other people (gypsies) came in during the night. As for the room, it was carpeted (which, in baking Summer-Rome, is asking for trouble!), was littered with rubbish and stunk of sweat. The room looked over the main street (just around the corner from the station) so I spent most of the night trying to block out the fumes/noise of the traffic; it was either that, or suffocate in the room. I am not new to Rome: I have lived there in the past - I can honestly say that I have never experienced anywhere like this on my travels. Like the other reviewer, I too left the next day and found somewhere much nicer not far from that area.

My wife, 2 children and I stayed in Acropoli for 3 nights in Oct. 2004. Staff were very friendly and helpful. It's a 2 star hotel so the beds, bathroom, breakfast etc. are basic. But what do you expect when you pay 390 Euro's for 3 nights in a quadruple room in the centre of Rome? By the way: We booked directly by e-mail and NOT via internetsites like Octopustravel. It saved us 60 to 90 Euro's!! We slept at the back of the hotel, so it was quiet enough. But a few floors above us were students who made a lot of noise during the last night... However they do have camera's on each floor to see what's happening.", "Date": "October 31, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Acropoli", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d296830-Reviews-Hotel_Acropoli-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$51 - $1,317*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Principe Amedeo 63-67</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00185</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "296830", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/75/b2/75b282725f9d1027938038d08653ae0a5large.jpg"}}
