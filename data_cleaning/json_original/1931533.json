The staff is very friendly and service oriented. The hotel is walking distance to anything in El Gotic and the main streets with shopping, Passig de Gracia, etc. Hotel was clean and housekeeping did an excellent job daily. We didn't eat at the hotel so can't speak to the food. I opt'd for a top floor 'suite' with the deck and private jacuzzi tub. I thought this would be perfect after a day of walking and exploring. My particular suite, room 603, was not much bigger that a regular hotel room. There was an extra seating/lounge area but the TV was mounted right over it so you really couldn't lounge to watch TV. The space seemed useless. The jacuzzi tub was broken and they couldn't fix it during my 5 day stay. This rendered the top floor deck/jacuzzi tub useless. To me this left me in just a regular room at the suite rate. The manager gave me 20% off my bill and a free breakfast, after negotiating up from his original 10% offer. I still left mildly disappointed as I feel I shouldn't have paid more than a regular room rate. The room was cold upon arrival and took a few hours to heat up. After a long trip we took a nap under the blankets with our coats on. We thought the heat was broken but it was just a very low air flow out of the vent. I recommend they get a head start on heating the room before they check people into it. A couple other notes, the bathroom door is glass and transparent. You can see anyone in there doing any bathroom business. We draped the cheetah print blanket over the door and clipped it to the door frame with a couple hangers. You can hear street noise. If you are a light sleeper this could be an issue. You will hear the drunk folks yelling down La Rambla until about 3am. I wouldn't return based on my personal experience, plus I'd want to try one of the other nice places I saw embedded in El Gotic, but I wouldn't recommend you not try Hotel Bagues.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cosenza, Italy", "Title": "\u201cLuxury, Style and excellent attention at unbeateble location.\u201d", "Author": "GUSDALI", "ReviewID": "UR125247107", "Content": "This hotel was the very best we have ever experienced in Barcelona and we also can say, among all the other 8 we stayed during our recent two-week trip by Spain.

The room isn't very spacious but you have everything you will need in it. For those many reviews I have read before deciding to disregard them and stay at this hotel ,that its very loud,shame on them ,because the windows they have installed are sound proof. We took the room with the view on las ramblas and to prove my point my baby never woke up by the noise of the street. As long ad the window is shut ,you will have no noise issues. The ramblas street is very entertaining ,if you stand in your balcony you will feel like you are in the middle of the action. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Most of the staff are not even native Spanish ,and their English is okay. As soon as we arrived they greeted us and the person at the help desk gave us a map and started pointing out the attractions and the places we might want to visit during our stay in Barcelona. Breakfast was okay ,don't expect much though,it's a bit expensive because there are very narrow items ,but we decided it was more convenient since we had our baby with us. The room is cleaned twice a day ,once in the morning after you leave for breakfast and another time in the afternoon ,and it's when they leave you a note card of tomorrows expected weather as well as chocolate. We were sent a complimentary bottle of wine same day of arrival. As for the bathroom it's all glass you can see through the glass door ,it didn't bother us ,because it was me and my husband in the room,but I'm sure it would bug us if we had been sharing a room with a friend rather than a spouse.

We were in room 603 and I must admit the other suites on that floor did seem to have more spacious terraces with sun beds etc and I don't know if that means our room was slightly less in price, I don't think so but it is worth bearing in mind when booking. We do have a few grumbles but must admit they are minor and really only about the housekeeping side of things. The fan in the bathroom wasn't working and although there was a flower vase in the bathroom, there were no flowers. We had special towels for using outside (we noticed these were also on the roof for using in the pool) delivered on the first evening (about 8 ish) after we had already used the tub and not again during our stay? We had mats for either side of the bed and the weather forecast for the next day delivered on the second evening but not on any other night and although there were glasses and tumblers in the cupboard for use with the mini bar on the first night they were not automatically replaced and we had to ring down and ask for them.

As I was misled by those overwhelmingly positive reviews, I felt like I have to put things into proportion. My review is purely subjective. However my personal approach to rate hotels are the criteria of the European Hotelstar Union (EHU, knowing that Spain - unfortunately - isn't part of it yet). First of all: in my opinion this is NOT at all a 5-star-hotel. So if you are used to service, facilities and professionalism of large luxury hotel chains like Conrad, Kempinski or Hyatt you will be disappointed. In this case: lower your expectations. ---------------------------------------- Rooms ---------------------------------------- This hotel seems to aim at tourists, not at business people. I went there for a mixed private/business trip during my summer holidays and I wanted at least to treat myself with a good hotel. When I travel for business I always make sure to book a 5-star-hotel to find the services and facilities I might need. And here comes one of the key problems: the hotel is not at all designed for business travelers. So if you plan to work with your computer, forget about it. In your room you won't find a desk, no chair. Nothing. Also don't let yourself mislead by the room description. The fact that they mention \"WiFi\" doesn't mean that it's included in the room rate. They give you one hour a day for free. If you need more, you have to pay extra (unfortunately this became a common problem in most hotels as the WiFi connection is often maintained my an external service provider, as in this case). You can get a LAN-cable to connect to wired Internet for free (works great), however the cable is too short, so the only place where you can use it, is the well designed but very uncomfortable couch that will break your back after an hour. A desk and a chair is a minimum requirement even for 4-star-hotels if it was rated following the EHU guidelines. For the rest, the rooms are small but comfortable, clean and modern. You'll find a fancy oversized Sony Bravia Screen that faces the Sofa, not the bed (very limited selection of international channels, I didn't mind, just so you know). The bathrooms are modern, clean and have a nice look (dark design, if you like it), however - at least in my room - there was only a shower. Again (sorry): I never staid in any 5-star-hotel without a bath tub. Also basic Spanish hotel classification guidelines require a shower AND a bath tub even for 4-star-hotels. But well, the shower was stylish, clean and of good size. You find toiletries, slippers and bathrobes in the room. ---------------------------------------- Sound insulation ---------------------------------------- Talking about the sound insulation of the rooms: I stayed in room no. 202 (fortunately) facing the beautiful entrance of \"Iglesia de Betl\u00e9m\", not directly La Rambla. The hotel obviously put a lot of efforts in soundproofing their rooms, however it's impossible to keep out the screaming and singing of thousands of people, garbage collection working all night (waste container under my room), police sirens etc. It's a very busy place all night long. If you are sensitive to noise you will not have a good night sleep. In case you don't know Barcelona: the hotel is well situated at La Rambla. At the same time there is probably not a noisier place than that all over the city. You have to compromise between being at the heartbeat of the city and having a quiet place to sleep. Please be aware of that before you book. ---------------------------------------- Service and staff ---------------------------------------- Now talking about the service which over the years became most essential for me while traveling. Most reviews here on Tripadvisor are complimenting the friendliness of the staff members. And yes, they are in deed all trying to be very friendly. You'll always get a smile and a \"How are you?\" when you cross one of them. I'm not blaming any of those people, I can only blame the management for not giving them what they need to run a luxury-hotel. Here are only some examples of what happened to me (regarding service attitude): 1) I'm a Club member of Small Luxury Hotels (SLH) and I booked a special SLH-rate that includes a free room upgrade, breakfast and late checkout. When I got to the hotel, I asked if they did upgrade my room. They told me it wasn't possible because the hotel was fully booked. OK, fair enough. This is a common policy and I can't blame them for that. However what I'm used to from other luxury hotels is at least a small sign of compensation, like a welcome drink or at least a formal \"We are very sorry about it, can we do anything else to improve your stay?\" But nothing. OK... 2) When I went to the elevator to go to my room I realized that they printed the price of 22 Euros daily for breakfast on my room card. I went back to the front desk and told them that there was a mistake. With a smile the lady said: \"No, it's not.\" I told her that breakfast was included in the SLH rate. Again she said: \"No, it's not.\" Sorry, this is absolutely unacceptable behaviour in a so-called luxury hotel. One of the basic rules in luxury hotel business is that the guest is never wrong (even when he is). I had to start a 5 minute discussion in front of other hotel guests (!) till she finally understood that it was their mistake. I felt pretty embarrassed. She said she was not aware that I was a SLH Club member which is a weird excuse because, together with my credit card and my ID, I also handed her my Club SLH Club card right in the beginning. Well... 3) Next morning I realized that they also printed the wrong room rate on my room card so I started to feel like something went really wrong with my booking. That's why I contacted SLH directly to have them check my rate with the hotel and I also informed them about this humiliating treat I received on my arrival (the room rate I booked was advertised with a \"VIP WELCOME\" and a \"PERSONALISED STAY\", hmmmm... see what I got). They contacted the front desk and it seemed like they solved all issues (SLH contacted me back to confirm). However I did not receive any apologize from the hotel management for the misunderstanding and their wrong assumptions. Just as an example: Conrad Hotel in Brussels once gave me an upgrade from a standard room to one of their best suites only (!) because they forgot to answer one of my e-mails. They just did it, without me blaming them for anything. It's not what I was expecting in this case - but at least some warm words of apologize. 4) Next morning I realized that I must have lost my lighter somewhere at the airport (the hotel is a non-smoking hotel, however I was allowed to smoke on the balcony and on the roof top). So I went to the front desk to ask for matches or a lighter and... (not kidding) I was told that this is a non-smoking hotel, that's why they don't have any matches or lighters available. I guess I was too tired to freak out... Fantastic. They advised me to buy a lighter in one of the shops on La Rambla (not easy at 6:30 am). 5) So I thought instead of smoking, maybe doing some sports would be a great idea. I asked where to find the gym/workout room. The answer: \"Sorry, we are a new hotel, so it has not yet been opened.\" (afaik the hotel exists since October 2010). Wow, why wasn't I surprised? 6) On Saturday evening I had a meeting and I realized that the only fancy shirt I had was completely wrinkled, so I went to the front desk to ask for an ironing board. Just a very normal thing to ask for. But wrong question again: \"No, we don't have an ironing board for our guests. But we offer a laundry service.\" Cool. \"But could you return my shirt within 1 hour?\" Answer was no. \"Only tomorrow.\" I don't have to tell you again, that having an ironing board available for their valued customers is a basic requirement - even for a 3-star. 7) Another detail: why would they clean the roof top with a noisy high-pressure cleaner during the already very limited opening hours (9am - 7pm) - insane. This spoiled even the last morning of my stay. 8) The fitness center (that was supposed to be open between 9am and 10pm) doesn't exist. 9) When I checked out, nobody asked if I was satisfied with my stay. OK, the answer is pretty obvious - however it is always a good thing to do (and would have been a good occasion for them to find out what they could do better). I can't help, but rather finding myself with a staff that is willing to go the extra mile, I felt that there is what I call a \"computer-says-no-mentality\" (and I don't think I asked for anything weird!?). The only person who actually responded the way I am used to, was the front desk staff member who confirmed my late check-out at the day before my departure (yeah, I couldn't believe that I got one). He acted in a very professional way, addressed me with my name, was actively offering solutions. The hotel management should also rethink the dress code of its staff. In 2011 I don't expect them to wear a three piece suit, however e.g. I was afraid the doorman, who suddenly jumped in between me and the entrance on my arrival, wanted to steal my suitcase. He was dressed 100% casual, no uniform, not wearing anything with the logo of the hotel or a badge. Also I was very surprised to see some front desk staff members in camouflage t-shirts. It might be part of the design concept, but definitely out of place: it's a luxury hotel, not a military base (some guests from specific countries might even take offense). ---------------------------------------- Breakfast / Food ---------------------------------------- Some people here complained about the small buffet breakfast. I agree it's not a Hilton breakfast, but it's a small choice of tasty high quality products. You can ask for eggs in whatever way you want them to be prepared. It's delicious and presented in a very nice way. But still, my tip is: if you don't have the breakfast included in your room rate, try it once and for the rest of your stay invest the 22 Euros in one of the many other food-options in the neighbourhood (not directly at La Rambla cause most of it is a rip-off). The breakfast place is an open space facing the reception desk. I felt highly irritated by the hotel staff always straying around the front desk, having fun, talking without restraint, joking, even high-fiving while I was having breakfast. It made me more feel like in a youth hostel than in a luxury hotel. That's one of the reasons why one day I decided to have my breakfast in-room (26 Euros, or a 5 Euros top-up in case you have the buffet breakfast included in your rate). I got a very (!) small selection of things that you would also find at the buffet breakfast, but not rich enough to start the day. Not worth it. With the breakfast I was happy to get a small thermos jug of coffee. How disappointing that the jug was almost empty (less than half of a small cup of coffee) and cold. It took me three minutes to explain the room service on the phone (half Spanish/half English) to replace it. 5 minutes later I got a new jug (full and hot). Thank you! At that point I started to be happy about the small things in life! I also tested the 24h-room-service and ordered a \"8-greens-salad\" (11,40 EUR + VAT) and a \"cheese selection\" (13,50 EUR + VAT). The rooms service was efficient, fast and friendly. The ingredients were fresh, the cheese excellent, everything was well presented. However don't expect to satisfy a big hunger. It's just a snack. My suggestion to the kitchen would be to serve some normal bread with salad and/or cheese. Those 5 small slices of dry bred chips are more decorative than anything else. I didn't get the chance to test the restaurant (which is the same place than the the breakfast area). As it's right in the entrance hall of the hotel, again facing the front desk, its location didn't really make me want to give it a try. ---------------------------------------- Negative aspects ---------------------------------------- - Fighting about my room rate in front of other hotel guests (no-go!) - \"Computer-says-no-mentality\" (see everything I mentioned before) - No appologizes from the management for obvious mistakes they made - Attitude and dress code of staff was a bit too casual for my taste (please no military look) - Lack of basic equipments in the room (working desk, chairs) - rooms relatively small for a 5-star - No coffee maker or kettle in room - No bath tub, only shower - Not offering basic services of a 5-star (like ironing board etc.) - No gym / workout room / spa - Breakfast in room too expensive for what it is (e.g. half a cup of cold coffee) - WiFi only 1h per day included - mind the advertised Notebook-safe: It's not bigger than any other in-room safe I know - that means a 15\" Laptop will fit in, anything bigger (like mine) won't - pool on roof top is very small - advertised bar on the roof top was always (!) closed during my 5-day-stay ---------------------------------------- Some positive aspects ---------------------------------------- As my review above might sound very negative (and in deed my personal experience was very disappointing), I still want to point out some positive aspects and give the hotel some credit: + A very central location from where it's easy to reach any location in Barcelona (I did not use public transport once). My tip in case you are interested in modern art: the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona (MACBA). It's a stone's throw away from the hotel and worth seeing it. + My room had a small balcony (I guess most rooms do) which is always a nice (and rare) thing to have. + Cleanliness: the room maids did a great job. I always found my room in impeccable conditions. Unfortunately, sometimes the least paid people are doing most of the work in a hotel. + Room service was fast and efficient. + Roof top (7th floor) with bar (it was always closed during my stay) to relax. However it's difficult to relax on this kind of chairs (I've literally seen people falling off). + \"Pool\" - yes the hotel advertises a roof top pool, and yes: there is something that could be considered to be a pool. However don't expect it to be a \"swimming\" pool, but a good place to jump in an cool down. + Huge Sony Bravia screen in-room (in case you fancy it). + Contrary to other comments I found the space for cloth (wardrobe etc.) being adequate (at least in my room) + Even if I didn't consider the front desk staff resp. the management to be on a 5-star-level (see all my review above), at least they are all being friendly (even if most of the times the answer was \"no\" they would still smile at you). + You can connect your iPod if you have one. ---------------------------------------- Conclusion ---------------------------------------- My personal rating would be a \"3 stars superior Design Hotel\", with the ability to become a decent 4-star-hotel if they change some very basic things (see everything above). Because of its limited facilities and the lack of space in their rooms e.g. to install a desk with a chair, I don't see the possibility to become a true 5-star-hotel.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bath, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful stay in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "TMinter", "ReviewID": "UR116196785", "Content": "We looked at several hotels for our 20th anniverary break in Barcelona without kids.

I would call it a small boutique hotel. Very friendly staff, the room we had was small, enough though for a couple with a small baby. It is very modern, some nice details. The bathroom is very elegant with the best rainshower ever. There is a rooftop lappool with a nice terrace overlooking the city. Breakfast was not included and I thought it was a rather small buffet. We enjoyed going to the Rambla for all our meals. I would definitely come back to this hotel, the price we paid was also very reasonable for the superb location.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in wonderful location\u201d", "Author": "hayleenaj", "ReviewID": "UR107449529", "Content": "The staff in the hotel were very helpful. When we arrived, we were offered a choise of two rooms, one with a view of the ramblas or a quiter room facing the internal part of the hotel. We chose the quiter room which was also slightly larger. The rooms aren't 100% soundproof but neither of us had any difficulty sleeping at night. The room was beautiful and the hotel had left strawberries and a bottle of water to welcome us on arrival. Chocolates were also left on our bed each night with the temeperatures for the next day which was a nice touch. The bathroom had an amazing rain shower and toiletries were replenished each day. The staff were very helpful and any requests were immediately attended to e.g. more towels, room service. The location was great, within walking distance to la barceloneta as well as the passeig de gracia and right of placa de catalunya. Also, you are 2 minutes from the metro. We did not eat in the hotel as there are so many wonderful restaurants in the area but the menu looked nice and there was 24 hour room service which was handy. One thing, the pool on the roof isn't a pool for swimming in, just relaxing.", "Date": "May 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "east valley", "Title": "\u201cNot our style\u201d", "Author": "exurbia", "ReviewID": "UR106287912", "Content": "This is not a hotel we would stay at again. Some of things we liked about it were: helpful and friendly front desk and housekeeping staff. The location is really great if you want to be right in the middle of the action. Great shower. It is clean and modern. Some of things we didn't care for: street noise was an issue - no surprise since our room was facing the street (on the 4th floor). Others love the bathroom but it was not for us. A bathroom with a clear glass door looks sleek and modern, but allows no privacy when getting out of the shower. Also, a person can easily walk right into it when the lights are dim as my husband did on a few occasions - it got a little annoying after a while. It can be difficult to tell if the door is all the way closed or ajar. Lastly, our rate included breakfast. It was fine. They apparently charge $30 for this breakfast.
