We traveled in a group of three, a couple and our friend. Booking was made together, however they split us up in to two different buildings with our friend in the main building and us round the corner. We asked if we could be in the same building, they said no which we accepted as they may have been full. However, our phone didn't work so we couldn't call her or reception from our room and had to use our mobiles or walk round to the main building. We informed reception twice during our sty and they did nothing about this. The room itself wasn't too bad although it was a strange shape and very small. The bathroom was tiny but nice, shower worked well, equipment seemed newish and was tiled all over. Our friend's room was also very small but her bathroom was terrible and she has problems with both her shower and hairdryer. Location was good and I know a few people haven't liked the view from the window of the extra building, which looked out on to a small (and dirty) courtyard but we actually thought that was the most interesting part of the hotel! I suppose this was because the rooms themselves weren't great. Noise was a massive problem at the hotel and this was in both buildings. Our friend could here the old rickety lift going all night and had people running up and down the corridors and walking in and out of reception... Walls were very thin! We had a similar problem in the building round the corner. It was very hard to sleep as the noise of the heavy front door could be heard clearly and it was incredible how well the sounds of footsteps and voices traveled so clearly. It sounded like there were people just outside our door constantly, which they weren't but it was just so loud! This made us feel a bit nervous at night as the building was mainly flats, seemed quite derelict and the front door was rarely shut. We didn't feel secure. There was only one night when we had to use the key to get in to the building (out of four days of going in and out). The other problem in our room at night was the light. It was fine when it was on so we didn't know there was a problem until we tried to sleep... As soon as you switched it off, it flashed! Impossible to sleep with a flashing light so we pulled out the electricity key by the front door so that we had no electricity at night. this meant we had to use the light from our phones if we needed to get up in the night. We informed reception of the problem. They seemed unsurprised and unapologetic but said they did say they would have someone look at it. They didn't in four days of us being there and even after we brought it up three times. Overall I would not recommend this hotel. It is only a 2* hotel, so of course this has to be kept in mind but the service was awful. There was no effort to improve our stay so we were very disappointed. If I go to Rome again I would avoid this hotel. I was happy with the location but in truth this was the only positive, oh apart from the coffee which was lovely in the morning (tea and juice were undrinkable!). Don't stay here unless they have drastically improved their customer service since our stay and you take a good pair of earplugs!", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Newcastle, Australia", "Title": "\u201cDisgusting Never Stay Here!\u201d", "Author": "mel s", "ReviewID": "UR119736781", "Content": "This hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in.

We asked for the air conditioning to be turned on and were told \"yes it will be turned on\". Obviously these people had no intention of ever turning it on as they never did but were quite happy to continually lie to us and tell us it was being looked at.

Standards of which this hotel doesn't even come close to meeting. There is a reason why this hotel is 2* and it will stay that way for a very long time. The website is filled with erroneous information, this hotel is NOT a simple walk away from Roma Termini. This is a major untruth! We took the metro to Castro Pretorio and we still had to walk 12 minutes to arrive at the hotel. The hotel shares the building with other offices on the ground floor. The hotel occupies the 1st to 5th floors of the building. The elevator was the first sign of many depressing things to come. This elevator was straight out of the 1940's. Controlled by weights, and no luggage is allowed inside. Reception is a small squeezed up area next to the dining area which was composed of 4 tables and 10 chairs. On arrival into the room, it was a double bed, when we specifically asked for a twin room. They sent someone an hour after to make the change. Their idea of a double bed is pushing two beds together with one sheet. The door to the balcony didn't close properly so we had to guard our valuables when we left. The safe didn't work either. The television never worked and reception seemed to have no clue how to get it to work. There is wireless internet available in the reception area, and I was told by the manager it can only be accessed between 1200hrs and 2100hrs. This I found to be quite absurd. I came in one evening at 2045hrs, and I went to reception to use the internet, and just after 9pm, the manager turned off the wireless router without asking me if I was finished. I have NEVER been to a hotel in my life, where this has happened. The elevator broke down with me in in one night as well, and it took me jumping up and down for 20 minutes to get it working again.

To enter the main hotel you have to be buzzed in twice, which wasn\u2019t explained to us when we arrived, and some of the people on reception seemed really unwilling to let us in, as if it was a huge chore to press a button next to their desk. Reception and most of the rooms are up 2 flights of stairs, and the lift is very temperamental (we got stuck in it). Some issues other people have raised: Lack of restaurants in the area \u2013 between the Hotel and the Termini are at least 12 restaurants. Some of them are ridiculously expensive though. Noise \u2013 a couple of times other residents could be heard through the walls but no constant noise. Room 25 \u2013 we stayed in here too! I thought it was pretty nice, but I get the feeling the room had been repainted quite recently. The door handle was redundant but you could still open the door with the key and no-one could open the door from the outside without a key, so it was safe enough. Small dining room \u2013 this is fairly usual in family-run places throughout Europe, so I was not that surprised.

We were all slightly worried about the hotel as had read some bad reviews but ignore them as this hotel was great. Location - it was about a 20/30min walk to the centre of town ie the Trevi fountain. We only walked it a couple of times though as it was VERY hot in July! It was really easy to get a bus into the centre/collosseo/vatican from just down the road for 1 euro per trip so we just did that most of the time, however the metro was also really easy to use. We were also slightly worried about safety but felt completely safe in the area, late at night we got a taxi home to be safe and due to the fact that the buses stop running at about midnight for about 15 euro for 6ppl. Thelocation was central enough and probably the most central you will get for the money. Hotel facilities - when we were in the hotel it was purely for sleeping and showering so for that purpose it was perfect. The only minor problem we had was that in 1 room the a/c wasn't really that cold but okay for us, you may have sruggled if you get really hot at night, and in the other room the a/c went off between 1-5am which was a bit bizzaire, but this didn't ruin it at all.

I would not hesitate in going back there.", "Date": "January 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "paris france", "Title": "\u201ccorrect hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4159712", "Content": "My wife and me were there in april 22 for 5 nights, correct hotel,well situated and clean,staff helpful, price is ok if you campere wth other hotels outside rome, my be in summer it can be horrible because of no air conditionning! i advise to go from september to may hakim from paris", "Date": "December 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morpeth UK", "Title": "\u201cRip Off\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4021911", "Content": "I booked two superior double rooms 6months prior to our trip in October and received written confirmation. We arrived with this confirmation and were informed that no rooms were available until the next day. They found us two awful rooms in a very poor Pensione, while we were there we noted the price on the back of the doors were 90 & 46 euros. When we came to pay the bill they tried to charge us 135 euros per room for those rooms, after much argument, we still had to pay 75 euros per room for that night, for their mistake. Please note that in Hotel Baltic, The, Bar, Reception, & Breakfast area (5) tables are one and the same room, not practical at all. However rooms were clean.

Rooms are in 2 separate blocks and on second floor no lift so beware but 24 hour reception good for late arrivals.
