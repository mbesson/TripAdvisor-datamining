{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great value 1. cleaniness2. location3. priceWhile searching for a decent priced hotel in the Fishermans Wharf area, we literally ran into it. It is located in the same block of the Marriot, Hilton and Holiday Inn. It's at the corner between Jones and Bay, a 3 minutes walk to the piers, 10 mins from North Beach. Extremely safe and touristy area. Rooms are motel size, VERY clean, have probably the biggest showers I've ever seen at a motel. Front desk are quite helpful. We did skip breakfast as it was a joke but used their wireless connection which worked great. Parking is 10$ per day and it's a great deal too. The only downside consisted in the house keeping lady, who lets her little daughter play in the guest rooms while cleaning. Not really professional. She left our tv on for all day on a cartoon channel. I would definetely stay there again, as it is the only option if you do not want to spend +170$ at the hotels nearby nor want to end up in a proprer hotel just in the middle of the Tenderloin. We paid 89$ including taxes and parking (weekday) which goes up to 139$ including taxes and parking during weekends. checkout their website, they have special internet rates. All in all a great deal.", "Date": "Jul 16, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR930677828", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "GiovanniFirenze"}, {"Content": "Nice but could be better We asked for a non-smoking room but got a room that was so stincky we couldn't even sleep.
