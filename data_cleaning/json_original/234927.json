Altstadt Spandau (nearly the only part of Berlin with \"atmosphere\") has 2 stations. One is called Altstadt (the U-Bahn station is 3 minutes walk from Hotel Benn) -and the station of Spandau (U-Bahn, S-Bahn and the railway stops here), which is 5-6 minutes walk from the hotel. There is not much difference (in time) to come from the airport between the different railways: more or less 1 hour. The hotel is nicely maintained: clean rooms and helpful personnel. the breakfests are really great. The prices (like everywhere in Berlin) are overpriced - particularly during any important Fair. The hotel has 2 blocks: one is a charming wing (looks to be a mediavel builiding from the outside) -the other just the opposite: an appartment building from the forties (or so). We had expereiences with the second one: like most so called hotels in Berlin: the flats are converted to small individual rooms and sold as hotel. (Not quite a real hotel, though). I had the chance to stay on the 3rd floor - a real climb (particularly with luggages) through the narrow and squaky staircase... First time I stayed in a room, where the shower-cabin was inside the room. (The WC was separate). But once you get use to it - it can be OK. I have not seen the other rooms of the hotel, they could have been different. All in one: ** and a half.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "castricum", "Title": "\u201cClean and friendly\u201d", "Author": "truus z", "ReviewID": "UR119446158", "Content": "I stayed in hotel Benn for 3 nights with my daughter.

For one night - it was enough. There wasn't separately bathroom, the shower was in the room. The breakfast was good, but nothing special. In conclusion: it's usual 3 star hotel.
