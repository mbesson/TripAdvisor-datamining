We didn't know it was also the Casa Moderna, as it was not listed. The names have not been switched over yet according to staff. Valet was adequate, our bellman George, was amazing! He showed us how to work things in our room, gave us directions, even placed our things in the closet. You have to enter up a side hallway/elevator to get to the check-in on the 3rd floor (odd set-up). The front desk agent was ok, kind of side tracked, but there is only one agent/desk for the hotel to check in and out of. The spa was closed while we were there due to water damage or renovations, so that was a bit of a bummer, but you can still get massages in your room. We had booked a Junior Suite, but they upgraded us to the Biscayne Suite automatically when we arrived, at no extra cost. The room was amazing!!! Full living area, a look out nook, floor to ceiling windows, huge bathroom with soaking tub, exquisite bed/linens, and a private balcony. There are TV's in every room, including in the bathroom mirror, which was actually really nice for getting ready, and there's no shortage of towels which I love. My only complaint was that the \"Bay View\" wasn't quite that great on the 8th floor and we were still close to the main road, but the room made up for it. The toiletries are Bulgari, but the shampoo/conditioners seemed cheap and the other products were adequate. We ordered breakfast from Amuse (the hotel restaurant) and it was good, but they were small portions, typical with room service. All in all, we liked the hotel and would stay there again, maybe on a higher floor.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vero Beach, Florida, United States", "Title": "\u201cPosh Luxury Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Amor4Marcio", "ReviewID": "UR125775183", "Content": "Casa Moderna is a beautiful hotel! Some of my co-workers and I stayed here to attend a convention and enjoyed our stay so much that we spent less time at the convention and more time at the hotel. It was a little hard to find but we only had to drive around twice before we figured it out. All the staff at check in were friendly, knowlegable and efficient. Andres brought all of our bags to our room, was extremly helpful making sure we had everything we needed and answered all of our questions. He is a top notch employee! The rooms are beautiful, beds are very comfortable but the bathrooms lack privacy so you should be very comfortable with who ever you travel with. The closet is very large, nice balcony and cool tv in the mirror of the bathroom. We only had the chance to enjoy breakfast in the restaurant and it was good. The eggs benedict was over-cooked but the stuffed french toast we all shared was excellent! The pool and hot tub was great! The spa was confusing as no one seemed to be on the same page as to it being under construction or not. I had called and spoke with Roxanne the manager weeks prior to book facials and massages for the five of us. She told me that the spa was under construction due to water damage to only the mens locker room. She also advised she did not have the staff to accomodate us and they were not open in the evenings on Sunday. I asked if she would be willing to accomodate us for after hours but she did not seem the least bit interested. I had to call the spa twice as no one answered the phone or returned any of my messages. The five of us were disappointed that we could not get any services in the spa. The next day when we were checking out the front desk was not overly friendly and seemed annoyed that we even asked for a tour of the spa. We never did get to see it as they said it was under renovations and even if it was complete they would not have a key. Overall this hotel is absolutely beautiful! The rooms are very clean and stocked with plenty of top notch amenities. Housekeeping is on top of everything and very quick to respond.

Unfortunately the biggest let down for me was the internet it is very weak, the first night it did not work and the next morning when it did work it kept coming in and out. I have to say that this put a really bad taste in my mouth, in this day and age and paying $300+ per night you expect fast and reliable internet. I when to the front desk first night but nothing could be done. In the morning I called the reception and she told me that she will have someone restart the server. If the internet is not important for you then the hotel is really nice great view nice amenities are nice Bvlgari toiletries, (though they were not replenished again a letdown ) nice big TV, the hotel is in a nice position close to down town and a great view of the port. There are a couple of small let downs for this type of hotel one to me was major which was the internet. The second is the service directory is very tacky and is more for some cheap motel rather then this elegant place. For me the internet is very Important to me. The directory and the replenishing of toilets I can live with, though for that kind of pricing around $350 a night I think they could make the improvements. I will not stay there again unless I was 100% sure the internet was fixed or upgraded.

My family, a group of 15 arrived a week ago and stayed for 5 nights. The hotel is beautiful, and the rate was very good (includes wifi, amenities and parking). The area is walkable but a car is mandatory. Why I said this hotel is not for families ? first of all they don\u00c2\u00b4t have connecting rooms, so the families that booked 2 rooms because they have little kids (Ages 6,5 & 4) had a hard time trying to figure how they should split. The second thing and most annoying, is that the bathroom has no door, and the shower is made of cristal glass, so nobody can pass nearby while you are in the shower, very very uncomfortable situation.

I definately would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to go to Miami for a long weekend getaway. It's 10-15mins from the Miami airport and it's more relaxing than South Beach.

I would not pay full price for this hotel. It looks great, very modern and clean. We were even offered a free back massage at reception. However, the whole hotel feels like a library. I didn't feel we could raise our voices above a whisper at any stage. Even the pool area felt dead. The bed was AMAZING, so comfortable, and the room was quite large. The tv in the bathroom mirror was quite cool, but ultimately pointless, as you could only see it if you were straight in front of it. The shower and the toilet were around the corner so I don't see what benefit it was. The thing that really baffled me was that there was no door to the bathroom! Even the most intimate couples can do with a few minutes privacy a day. They could have at least put a glass door in, if they were worried about getting light into the bathroom (as there was no window), but removing the door completely is just plain stupid in my opinion. While sitting in bed, you could see the toilet straight in front of you. They only view we had from our window was the car-park building across the road, so we just kept the blinds shut, but our friends had a room with a balcony at the front of the hotel and the view was lovely. We could see all the ships docked in the port in front of us. When we returned from dinner, a very nice girl at reception said she would book a car for when we were leaving the next day. She even suggested that they could arrange a late check-out (just an hour or so) until the car arrived. The next morning our friends rang down to confirm the late check-out, with no problems, and so I rang down to do the same. The woman I got at reception actually laughed at me, in a really condescending manner, saying that they were full. I don't care how fancy your hotel is, you do not laugh at patrons who have a perfectly reasonable request, that was offered by one of your own colleagues less than twelve hours previously.

They didn't have the room that I had booked but offered to upgrade us to a suite. Let me say that it was an amazing room - great view of biscayne bay from the water view balcony. Incrdible bathroom. Very accommodating to our requests for a cot and extra towels etc. Room service breakfast was also great if expensive. Walk able to the bayside mall and the arena where the Miami heat play despite the rain. All in all a great stay. Highly recommended. We didn't use the pool which was on the top of the building - very windy but a great view.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Levittown, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cAwesome Hotel for our Girls trip\u201d", "Author": "princesa782", "ReviewID": "UR119691651", "Content": "OMG Tempo was amazing!!!

The rain shower felt so good and looking out to the bay while showering was an experience in itself. The location was perfect, only a cab or bus ride into South Beach. The views from the balcony were awesome and the balcony itself was huge!!! I spent many hours there just sitting out and enjoyinh the sun and the view. Everyone from the bellmen to front desk were very accomodating and willing to make our stay more enjoyable. On our check out date we had about 5 hours after check out until our flight and were not looking forward to carrying our luggage anywhere we went. The hotel held our bags free of charge and even let us use their ammenities until it was time to leave. The only complaint I had about the hotel was the fact they have no vending/ice machines. Waking up thirsty with no option to get a soda sucked but front desk sent up ice and water when we called so it wasn't too bad. Plus there is a convenience store next door so we just stocked up on soda and snacks the rest of the trip.

What an amazing hotel! When we checked in we were greeted and informed about all of the hotel amenities. I didn't get the girl at the front desks name but she was spanish and short (if that helps) lol..SHE WAS GREAT. very sweet. We went to our room which was a deluxe double. The only thing that is awkward about the room is the shower/tub area. It is completely exposed so we had to organize shower times but it wasn't a huge deal. Would've been great if it was a romantic trip! Our room was large and we had a really nice balcony that we left open for the most part to get fesh air. We didn't spend alot of time in the room but the time we did spend sleeping was great. The beds were incredibly comfortable and clean. The room in general was very clean you could tell the hotel is new. I don't suggest walking about the balcony barefoot though..lol my feet were filthy after a few minutes out there. W We did go to the pool/hot tub at one point which was very quiet except for a few children who were throwing rocks into the pool and diving in to get them (super annoying!) but, obviously not the hotel's fault. We had about 2 hours of uninterrupted hot tub time and it was super relaxing. We called down ten minutes before we wanted to leave to have a cab ready and they always were! I literally have no real complaints I had an amazing time in miami and I felt like my stay was everything I expected. I'm planning another trip in november with friends and we will be staying at the tempo again.

So we needed suite which had a living area where we could have the meeting. After a lot of research I found that Tempo was a good option. I wanted the Biscayne Suite. The hotel website had a rate of $316. Same was available for $216 on hotels.com. So check that website before booking at the hotel. We got into Miami at around 830 PM, rented the car and drove. The hotel is less than 10 minutes from the airport. It forms the lower part of an apartment building so keep that in mind. The building does have a fancy light on the side and so is easily identifiable from a distance. The location is on Biscayne Blvd but the access is from a side street. The hotel has valet parking. The check in is on level 3. The hotel does not seem to have much staff. When we got the to the hotel the valet and security guards seem to be the same. They were the same people who even got the luggage to the lobby. Dont expect much of a lobby. It is a small desk on a floor. The hotel also charges $30 per night as resort fee. This is a new ridiculous charge a lot of hotels have started. The fee was apparently for water!!!! and free high speed internet (a joke as the speed was less than even 1 MBPS). DIal up lines are faster. If they want to charge more money, just increase the rate. Dont ding customers with these ridiculous extras in the name of resort fee. And by the way, they dont give you evian or any of those fancy water bottles. It is one of their own bottles where they claim they give purified drinking water and for environment purposes reuse the glass bottles. No way to verify if the water is actually purified or from the tap. The biscayne suite was pretty large. More like a 1 BR apartment. There was a large living area with an L shaped couch. You could use the couch to sleep but it does not turn into a bed. So if there are 4 of you, forget being able to use the sofa as a bed. The room has a large dining table with 6 chairs. There is a small kitchen area and a wall mounted flat screen TV in front of the couch. The room was good size with a king sized bed. The bathroom was also quite large. Only problem was that there was no door to the bathroom. The shower area is all glass. So keep that in mind. Stay was overall OK. Room was nice. There was no exceptional service and so i am not sure why others at TA have been so kind to the place.

Initally I was looking to rent a condo on the beach, but with the lack of responses I began searching a hotel and came across the Tempo. I selected this hotel because of the close proximity to the Port of Miami. Getting to the hotel is a little confusing as our navigation didn't find the street. So, I called and spoke with Patricia whom was kind and very patient as she directed us to the hotel. The hotel is located on 11th street and US 1 (Biscayne Blvd). The hotel is located inside the Marquis Residences. You'll see \"MARQUIS\" in the water feature when entering. The parking is free when you advise the parking attendant you are staying at the Tempo Hotel. There are two lobby entries, which was a little confusing, but the gentleman directed us to the next lobby as that is the entrance for the Tempo. Enter the set of right doors and take the elevators to the 3rd floor which is the lobby of the Tempo. We were welcomed with warm smiles and pleasantries by Patricia and David. We were offered the lime water, which was very refreshing. Patricia had all paperwork & keys ready. I simply reviewed and signed paperwork. David introduced himself to Kartel and arranged delivery of luggage and item needed from our vehicle. We were in our room within 10 minutes after arriving. I reserved the Biscayne Suite and was given the Biscayne Suite on the highest floor. The suite was BEAUTIFUL......absolutely BEAUTIFUL.....I didn't expect the suite to be as spacious as it was. The views of Miami were lovely from the suite and we watched the cruise ships come in. Even with the rain and night skies, it was beautiful. David returned with our luggage and set it up for us in the dressing area. He then gave us a thorough overview of the room and its functionalities. He stayed so long with us, i wanted to ask him if he had other people to tend to, because he was truly interested in ensuring we are not to lift one finger for anything and WHATEVER we need he'll be there to care for us. He was even interested in about our international love and how we met, which I thought was nice. Kartel is interested in obtaining a pilot's license. Well, David was kind enough to bring Kartel printed information about places where he can begin lessons in central Florida. On another note, David is a super friendly, very intelligent man. He really should be a curator in a museum some where because he is a chock full of knowledge about everything. He really enjoys his position and meeting new people and you can tell. He is an exceptional human being. We ordered room service the first night because Kartel was so excited about the room he didn't want to leave. (LOL) The restaurant Amuse is located on the 3rd floor in the hotel. The food was delicious and made with great care, BUT it was expensive to me as I'm a vegetarian so I didn't purchase any meat and Kartel ate seafood. $180.00 for two small dinners, 2 cocktails, and a dessert we shared. The food came quickly despite the restaurant having a party for Cinco de Mayo. The lady was very kind and set up the food for us on the table. Checkout was just as quick as checking in. We were offered some more delicious lime water with some treats, which we did enjoy again. When we arrived downstairs, our car was waiting for us and the parking attendant took our luggage. Overall, this was a great experience. The place was exceptionally clean, beautifully decorated, and the service was paramount.

Well, I never received any news papers on my stay and the internet service is the worst I have ever experienced in a hotel in the USA. I was unable to get online for the majority of the time and even when you go on it would be slow and then you lost connection shortly thereafter. Calling downstairs for assistance was a waste of time. Only on check out when I mention it again did that person truthful acknowledge that they were having issues, others would just saying they did not have any complaints about their internet. If I do not have access to the internet, I am not a happy person! On Thursday when we went to the restaurant before the game, they turned us back saying that they chef advised her not to take anymore orders!!! She was the only server it seems with a man at the bar. The restaurant maybe had 20 guests. Again, not happy. On check in, they tried to give me a deluxe room although I paid for a Premium deluxe room. If I did not stay at the hotel before, I would not have known the difference. I had to show her the travelocity confirmation and then she checked her system again. I am not sure if that was a genuine mistake or something else! Note there is a huge difference between the room, so please make sure that you verify your information before accepting the room. After all is said and done, the room was fabulous and the staff friendly.

Please do not get the wrong idea. I am in no way using the word WOW to describe how great my experience was, but rather to let EVERY SINGLE PERSON reading reviews on trip advisor to know how disgusted I am from this hotel. From the second we stepped foot through the doors to the third floor, we were welcomed by the sound of a screeching fire alarm asking us to evacuate the building. Lorna the lady at the concierge desk did not even look up to acknowledge the fact that we were there. I was the one who said hello, and received a rude hello back. No mention whatsoever about if we were to evacuate or not. In any case, she proceeded to check us in without one word about what to expect, where to go, or what amenities we had access to! She literally said NOTHING!!! To top it all off, she continued to have a full on conversation with another employee while we checked in. Since it was my first time in Miami, I was hoping to get some pointers as far as what we can do, but I got nothing. She didnt tell us about the spa, pool or anything that we can expect to see. When I first booked this room, I called in 4 different times asking about certain things before I actually booked my room. I had 3 main things I wanted to have on my trip. I wanted to be in front of a beach, have a balcony to enjoy the view of the water and the sounds of waves, and I wanted to be close to South Beach!! Well I was lied to about the fact that my room would have an ocean view, and I was about 10 minutes ($25) cab ride each way to South Beach!! Had I known I was going to spend this much money on cabs, I would have rather booked a $500 a night room that would have given me everything I wanted, not lied to me, and given me the service that 4 or 5 star hotels are supposed to give their guests. One other thing that pissed me off to know end was the fact that the hotel told me upon booking that they would charge a $100 deposit as soon as i booked the room, and charged the rest 24 hours before I got there. Well they charged the full amount about 5 days before I got there. Therefore, even if I wanted to switch hotels, I would not have been able to. When I told LORNA about this, she told me that i was wrong. I told her to check it before she talks and I was right. I was not compensated for this, nor was I given an apology!!! THEY DID NOTHING!!! Then I was told that they would be charging me $100 more per night as a deposit. Although, deposits are standard for hotel check in, $400 seemed high and they had not told me about this. When I said something, they said that its hotel policy and that its written in my reservation contract. I told them well it was also written that I was to be charged 24 hours before I get there and yet that wasn't the case. They did not say anything except shrug. I asked for a high floor at least and they said that they were all booked. Funny thing because i might have seen a total of 2 guest s the entire time I was there. All of this happened within the first 10 minutes of arriving. As you can tell, they left a bad taste in my mouth. The hotel has one employee doing the job of four different positions. Room service, housekeeping, concierge, and front desk are all run by one person at a time. Because of this, the calls often went to voicemail. LORNA was extremely rude throughout the entire time I was there. Not once was I treated like a paying guest! I asked for advil one night when it says the hotel offers it, and I was told to walk to the gas station and get it myself. We called the front desk so that they can call a cab. Thirty minutes later when we were ready to go out, they called us and told us that they called around and every taxi driver told them that it would be about 30 minutes to arrive so she didn't order it. Then she proceeded to tell us that we should just hail a cab. We are 3 young girls stuck in a remote area because we were lied to and we were told to hail a cab! I just could not believe what I was hearing. Every morning we ordered coffee and it was COLD! We asked for drinks at the pool and the person working told me that his shift was over. This was around 5, but the pool closes at 7! I asked about the manager of the hotel and they told me that it was Ryan Stone and that he would not be in until Monday. I wanted to wait to complain because I did not want to talk to an assistant. I expressed my anger to another employee and she was really nice (Kelly). I thought that Ryan would be more compassionate and help me deal with this. Instead he was condescending and was no help at all. I told him that my entire experience of Miami had been ruined because of the staffs service and the fact that the hotel was not what they told us it would be. My entire vacation was ruined because of this hotel. For me, my hotel is one of the most important things that I look for t make sure that its everything i want. I was lied to in many ways and i am very unhappy about that. I expressed every single concern that i just mentioned above and he asked me what i wanted. I told him that I wanted to be compensated for at least a night or two and he told me that he didn't think what i was complaining about warranted that. I asked him what he thought would warrant that request and he said that if the hotel promised something and didn't deliver. Is it just me, or was he just not listening to what I was saying. After fighting for a long time, he took off $100. Really?? What is $100 after my awful experience. I despised this hotel and it made me unhappy the entire time I was in Miami. The service and staff were very unpleasant and I am very disappointed in the treatment that i received from each and everyone there with the exception of Kelly and Addie. I really don't understand who employs these people and why the staff feels like they are gods gift to the world. I spent so much money on cabs. I could have booked a much better room that was on the beach and close to everything and paid the exact same. Instead I chose this one because they LIED to me.. Please don't go here because you will be miserable.. I travel a lot and I have never complained about anywhere that i have stayed. I have stayed in places that have not been to my liking, but the staff at these places helped to make t better. This was just an all around experience. I never write reviews but this was not going to get slipped through. Everyone needs to know what type of circus these people are running at the hotel TEMPO!!!

We had a part ocean/downtown view balcony. The hotel room was beautiful and it felt like a second honey moon. It was very close to the port of Miami and across the street from the American Airlines Arena. We even walked to the Bayside Market and had a delicious meal at Mambo Caf\u00c3\u00a9. PROS: Luxurious Room, very spacious, High Quality Furniture, Beautiful Views of Downtown Miami and the Ocean. Could see the cruise ships when docked from our balcony. Night shots from balcony are breath taking. Luxurious bedding. Spacious and beautiful stand up shower. Loved the built in TV in the bathroom mirror! Check in was fast and effortless. CONS: Street traffic is heavy starting at 4am and the sliding doors are NOT very good at keeping the noise out (even making sure the sliding door was shut properly). Could hear trucks passing by which woke us up and kept us up a little past 4am. We brought this to the attention of the front desk (a tall male) on the 3rd floor and asked if all rooms where as noisy (we were on the 10th floor) and his response was: \"there is nothing we can do about the traffic\". No attempt to make our stay more comfortable, no sympathy/empathy, no apology. We came to Tempo Miami hoping to relax, get a good night sleep and sleep in, but unfortunately we were not able to do so. If you are a really heavy sleeper or wake up before the sunrise this may not be an issue for you. In my humble opinion, if they want to categorize themselves as a 5 star hotel then they should invest on GOOD sound proof sliding doors. There was no life at the hotel: it seemed empty and the restaurant as well. We didn't run into any hotel guests during our stay other than the father and son we saw in the pool. We had breakfast at the restaurant and we were the only ones there. There were only about 4 small tables in the back of the restaurant. I was a bit confused by the layout and had to look around twice to make sure it was a restaurant. It was the most expensive breakfast I have ever had!! We do not mind paying high for a good meal, but this restaurant is very over rated and over priced. I was expecting much more after reading the reviews about the restaurant from the hotel website. We were very disappointed with the pool. It lacked maintenance and it looked nothing like in the pictures. We never bothered going in, it was very uninviting. To conclude I would have to say that overall, the luxurious rooms outweighed the cons. I would come back to Tempo in a heart beat if it wasn't because of all the noise so early in the morning.

The concierge made a great recommendation for dinner, and the bartender had some great suggestions for bars to enjoy after dinner. Valet staff was prompt and friendly. Check-in and check-out were a breeze. The room was immaculate and very well laid out. The bathroom was really cool, with two sinks, and the bathtub/shower was quite unique. The bed was very comfortable. The pools and hot tub on the 14th floor were a great touch, as well, with the water temperature being just right. Although we didn't use the fitness facility, it looked really big from the outside, with plenty of equipment. Next time we're in Miami, we will definitely stay at the Tempo.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belo Horizonte, MG", "Title": "\u201cMore than I have expected\u201d", "Author": "Vpfdm", "ReviewID": "UR69144527", "Content": "I was worried, because there were no photos of the hotel, and only 3 reviews by the time I went there.

While in Miami, my husband and I stayed at this lovely hotel. The hotel was so nice the room had a big walk in closet, comfortable bed, bathtub, ipod dock, big flat screen, and my favorite a television built into the bathroom mirror. The facility is nice although the only public places we were able to enjoy were the pool and the bar. The staff is very helpful especially arensha the concierge and the gentleman who checked us in I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to remember his name but it was German. The hotel is in a soft opening so the restaurant and the spa weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t available yet those were the only bummers on our stay. Also I find it weird that they did not have a tempo sign out front, the building says markees or something like that.
