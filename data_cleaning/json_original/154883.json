The lobby is beautiful, it has wicker love seats and tables set up and in the middle there is a pool with a tree and natural vegetation.. The walk to our room was nice and the grounds are beautiful. There is a natural waterfall on the grounds and one is in view from the restaurant. They have kept the jungle theme intact and have not re located the animals. Its not unusual to see peacocks, flamingos, and monkeys. We had a monkey come swinging onto our balcony one afternoon, which was a little scary at first. The down fall to this is there are droppings on the sidewalks that you have to look out for when you are walking. Our room was comfortable, clean and beautiful. It didnt have that musty smell that you can get in rooms near the ocean. The pool area and beach is definitly five star material. There was also alot to do right on the resort. Dance lessons, volleyball, yoga, games, and hair braiding. The staff was always friendly, and positive, no matter if it was your waiter, the bartender, or one of the dancers. The buffet restaurants were good, and we didnt bother even making a reservation at one of the al a cart ones.. What I liked most about this hotel is the convience of everything. No matter what building your in your a close walk to everything, beach, lobby ect.. The Playacar area is nice as well. We had to pass through a security check point just to get in.. A seventy Peso cab ride to Play a Del Carmen, and about an hour from the airport. They also have some vendors come in which you can barter with, who have a variey of items for sale..", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pearland, Texas", "Title": "\u201cSpring break paradise!\u201d", "Author": "Lisa B", "ReviewID": "UR126408105", "Content": "Just returned from 6 nights here......our first trip to Playa del Carmen. I read a lot of tripadvisor reviews prior to the trip, and I would have to say that I agree with most of them. This was our first \"all inclusive\" experience, and overall it was great! The property is beautiful, and the service spectacular! Rooms are ok, but then again we did not spend that much time in our room anyway. Breakfast buffet was great, but lunch & dinner were mediocre in my opinion. Ala carte restaurants were much better......specifically the Japanese, Italian and Steakhouse. We were a little disappointed that the bars - none of them had anything to offer for spiced rum. We are Capt Morgan drinkers, and there was no brand of spiced rum available even in the lobby bar where premiums are served. Other than that the drinks were certainly plentiful! and we tried several new ones. I personally like the Mojitos and Dirty Monkey. Ricardo, who helped us booking our excursions was awesome! We did the dolphin experience at Delphinus, Xplor and Tulum. Delphinus and Xplor were both exceptional and not to be missed if you have kids (we had our 12yr old son with us). We never made it to any of the shows or the disco while we were there, but there are certainly plenty of activiites going on at all times to keep everyone happy. From yoga in the mornings, to zumba and volleyball on the beach, bingo by the pool, ceramic painting, archery, ping pong........you name it! Our son has already asked if we can go back again for spring break next year! We will see. My hubby & I would like to go down there alone sometime too and just lay on the beach or by the pool the whole time!

First thing that i want to talk about is, the star friends team who is the best specially one who is name is Yohel , he is the assistant of the manager of the star friends team, he is a very special person who have a nice personality, he talk with all the guests in a different language, French, English and Spanish. Every time that he meets peoples he is always available and talked with them. He is always smiling , he always invite the guess to participate in the different activities during the day and even the night at Showtime he is always there inviting guests for dancing before and after the show or even just talk with them`. He is always in a good mood. That star friends Yohel who came from Iberostar Varadero Cuba and working to your resort in Riviera Maya deserves to be recognized for his good work. We see it, he is very dedicated to his work and he loves it, and we the guests we appreciate,it very much. I have never seen a person so dedicated as him in all my years of travel that i have done. He is the best of the best star friends,,,Yohel keep your nice smile and good work, thank you and hope you will pass the message to him personally. The Iberostar Tucan Quetzal is a very nice resort, with all the forest, the animals, the great staff who are they are so nice, doing their jobs with always the smile and their kindness.

The grounds are amazing with jungle in the middle, a waterfall right next to the main buffet, flamingoes, peacocks (pavo royal), iguanas, turtle, Tucan, parrots. We saw wild monkeys twice during our 5 day stay and a coatimundi. It was like having a zoo right in the hotel. We enjoyed the food. The main buffet was a bit better (more choices) than the food near the beach, but because of the view we ate at the pool restaurant, too. I loved the mariachi band in the Mexican restaurant. I don't understand people who eat hot dogs and burgers when in Mexico, but if you need them they are there. I preferred trying new things like cactus salad and palm hearts or breakfast taco (corn tortilla with refried beans, cheese and an egg sunny side up on top). minibar was well stocked with beer, soda and water, no snacks though. Our room was close to the pool/beach, but after all the food we ate I wouldn't care where the room is, you need to walk off all those calories! We walked into town instead of taking the taxi. Staff was friendly and you could always find someone if you needed help. The beach is soft and gets cleaned up every night. The pool is gorgeous and big. I was a bit disappointed that you couldn't swim at night. The conference facilities were nice with plenty of staff as well. We had a conference reception ON the beach which looked like a wedding reception. I was wow'ed. After sunset with lights and hor d'oeuvres. Very nice. The drinks are better in the lobby than at the beach, but then again the beach is better than the lobby.... One weird thing was that they charged for internet access. These days everyone offers free Wifi. And even the paid internet was only accessible in the lobby, not the rooms. For a hotel that has conference facilities, this sure makes it hard to do some work.

The staff here can not do enough for you, they are so polite and friendly and they work very hard to ensure you enjoy your stay.The food is very good and in the buffet restaurant there is soo much choice even the fussiest of eaters have plenty of choice. The best a la carte restaurant for us was the Italian. The food was very good but our waiter was amazing, we had a member of our party who has several food allergies so he arranged for some thing special to be made. Our check in/out went smoothly. The maids work very hard and do an excellent job although they come way to early which was a bit annoying, on our last day they came at 07.50 and check outs not until 12. im sure a word with reception would solve this. The only other small negative is there is a really bad DJ in the onsite nightclub which is a shame as its really convenient if you like a bit of nightlife. On each night we were in there the music stopped several times, he clealy didnt know what he was doing and the music would to and fro from hard house to grease music and then spanish. The same guy would then dish out towels by the pool. I think the hotel should employ a proper experienced DJ. Other than that our holiday was the best ever and i would definately stay here again, i have never experienced customer service this good. if anyone wants to ask any questions im happy to help Thankyou for an amazing holiday Iberostar.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCan't Wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "mcneilj", "ReviewID": "UR125826764", "Content": "Took my son to the Iberostar Tucan Quetzal for Reading Week. It was his first trip to Mexico and he said it was his best trip ever. I had booked the Tucan side but ended up on the Quetzal side. Sunwing's useless at answering requests and their webside hadn't allowed me to select a room with two beds. So I wrote to rrpptucque at the resort who said they couldn't guarantee my request. She was useless too; she hadn't even entered the request into the system. But the receptionist at the desk was great and found us a room with double beds. I had asked for a second or third floor but ended up on the ground floor which was fine. Looked like it was mating season for the peacocks so we had our coffee, every morning, watching the antics of the peacocks. I had read that the beds were hard. They are but we slept well. The next morning, I requested a foam pillow top. Either way, the beds were fine. The rooms are the only thing I would give three stars to at the resort. There's nothing wrong with them. They're smallish, they're nothing special and they need to be renovated. The resort is a solid 4 star and the service and the food are 5 star all the way. The hotel employees have had excellent training in customer service. Pablo, the Customer Service rep on the Tucan side, is very nice, very friendly and very helpful. We had to line up only once to book all our dinner reservations for the week and changing them was never a problem. I had booked a tour to Chichen Itza with Viator. Pablo called to ask how to go about confirming the hotel pickup since their North American phone number doesn't exist. The rep at the hotel (not an IB employee) snarled at me for pre-booking and wasn't at all nice about it (because he didn't get the commission, I guess) but he did his job and got my son and his friend (staying elsewhere) on the tour. They LOVED it; they were given beer and food all day and they went swimming in a cenote. They said the tour guide was EXCELLENT. (I told them he would be. Mexico is very good at selecting and training tour guides.) The resort is beautiful. We preferred the Quetzal side because of its vegetation and bird life but the Tucan is fabulous too. It's really the same resort. The pool is never crowded. The beach is fabulous. The service, second to none. The fridge in the room is supposed to be stocked every second day but ours was stocked every day. We're not pop (soda for our American friends) drinkers but we drank lots of water and had a few brewskies. The Japanese restaurant was entertaining and the food was good. We'd read that we should try the lamb at the Italian restaurant so we did. The reviews were right! The lamb is delicious and just melts in your mouth. My son said it was the best lamb he'd ever had in his life. I agreed. The tenderloin at the steak house was also nice, tender and done perfectly. We had dinner at the buffet only once. The food was good. One night we ate in Playa on Fifth Avenue and another night, at Xcaret at their dinner show. The location of the resort is perfect. You can walk into town in about half an hour. We stopped to use the free WiFi at Starbucks at the Playacar Plaza, just five minutes down the street from the resort, so we didn't time the walk. When we got home, my son asked his father, \"How do you walk with her? She walks so slowly!\" So you wouldn't want to depend on me for timing. :-) If you walk down the beach, you arrive at Senor Frogs in Playa del Carmen, ready for refreshments! The lobby bars are a great gathering place for pre or after dinner drinks. They have quiet entertainment and again, good service. The evening entertainment put on by the star friends was okay. I really enjoyed the music of the disco era one night. My son... not so much. :) The Miss Iberostar was funny/entertaining/boring/cheesy. We didn't stay till the end. (He'd had enough.) We tended to sit up by the bar and the pool tables. I kept him busy getting our drinks; he enjoyed chatting with the bartender who was having a ball dancing and singing while mixing drinks. We would have enjoyed the Folkloric Show but didn't get to see it. We went to Xcaret one day. It was okay. One day I wandered around the gated community of Puerto Aventuras, had lunch and watched the dolphins while he climbed the pyramid at Coba and had lunch in Tulum. PA is where you can swim with the dolphins. What a beautiful place, only 15 minutes from Playa. The only downside to the resort is the swim-up bar. It's nice at the Iberostar Cozumel. Fabulous at the Iberostars in Puerto Morelos. Not great at Tucan Quetzal. It's set off by itself in a secluded little pool that needs to be redone and repainted. The week we were there the same loud guests were on the same stools the entire week. They were friendly enough and asked us to join them. I politely declined explaining that I am allergic to smoke (which I am). My son wasn't crazy about their music choice. (They didn't like the birds or monkeys or solitude, they had to create noise by bringing their own boom box.) (No comment.) We didn't spend a lot of time there. The restaurants are smoke-free and they have separate areas in the lobby bars for non-smokers but you can't get away from smokers at the swim-up bar. I just don't remember smoking being an issue at the other Iberostars. Not that I would recommend the others over the Tucan Quetzal. The others are a bit nicer / newer but they're way too big (do you really want to walk half a mile from the lobby to the beach?) and they're 15 minutes from town which can get expensive when you have to take cabs all the time. We took a cab back from Playa to our resort. I had read that the cab ride was $5, $7, $8... so I gave him a $10, said thanks and took off. He didn't say anything; seemed satisfied with it. I LOVE Mexico and can't wait to go back. With my husband next time. :) Would I go back to the Tucan Quetzal? Absolutely. Looking forward to it! I'm an Iberostar fan. I just wish they'd offer free WiFi. Someone told me that what they charge for WiFi is crazy expensive.

We stayed here back in November, but just realized that I forgot to write a review. This resort is beautiful, well kept, well laid out, with lots to do. The beach was the quietest along the strip, it was beautiful, the food was great, the service even better. There was not one aspect of this resort that I could write a negative comment about....but I wanted to write about how they handled my wife's allergy. My wife has a FATAL egg allergy. If she gets the slightest amount of egg in her system....I mean if she eats a crumb of bread that was made with egg as an ingredient....her throat closes and she dies. So were we concerned??...yup! I emailed the resort ahead of time regarding her allergy and included all our travel information. When we arrived to check in, a person from guest services came over and introduced himself. He said they had received our email and had made arrangements for our stay. He said that every member of staff at every restaurant at the resort knew my wife was coming and about her allergy. He handed us a letter typed in Spanish to give to staff at all the restaurants explaining her allergy. It could not have been better. We gave the letter to a server at the buffet..he got the chef..and the chef took my wife around to EVERY dish and told her if eggs were in the ingredients. They happily did this anytime we needed. Every Al a Cart restaurant was aware that we were there and they made certain all her food was safe. Even in the Japanese restaurant, they made the whole meal right in front of us including eggs, and then before it ws served they brought out my wife's meal which they cooked in a seperate kitchen totally egg free. We did not have one single allergy issue the entire time....it was FABULOUS. The hard work of this staff is incredible. My advice to all travellers is to bring some extra money to tip them as they are the friendliest, hardest working people I have ever seen. I never like going back to the same resort twice. I figure, if I am paying hte money then I should have a new experience. Iberostar Quetzal has changed that....now I say why would I go anywhere else!!

This means if you are a divorced parent with custody, your ex will have to supply this notarized letter stating their permission. The Cancun airport itself has become quite modernized over the last 15 years. Long lines move fairly quickly as long as you have your documentation filled out in advance and \u201centrance fee\u201d in hand. Don\u2019t forget there are hustlers here trying to coheres you to spend money with them, and by this I\u2019m referring to the local \u201ctaxi\u201d drivers who are dressed in professional uniform so they look like part of the airport staff. If you\u2019ve already paid for your transportation (perhaps as part of a package), don\u2019t listen to anyone unless they have a sign or something official stating they are your driver and/or part of your reserved transportation company. FROM AIRPORT TO RESORT For pre-booked transport, the choices are typically private direct (only your party in the vehicle going straight to the resort \u2013 most expensive), direct (straight to the resort but sharing vehicle with others \u2013 less expensive than private direct), and non-direct (sharing with others and making stops at various resorts along the way to drop other passengers \u2013 least expensive, but can be annoying and take more than an hour to get to the final destination). We went direct and it took about 40 minutes. Lots of poverty to be seen along the way, but we never felt unsafe. LOBBY/CHECK-IN Lobby is very open and tropical with parrots on a large tree in the center, the first sign of the wildlife here. Check in was painless. ROOMS Average size, clean with great showers. POOLS Nice. One large pool, a sports pool and a smaller \u201cadult only\u201d pool. Most of the activities go on at the larger pool \u2013 water aerobics, games, etc. QUETZEL/TUCAN Both sides very similar, Tucan maybe a bit more casual. Each has it\u2019s own buffet restaurant (very similar) and share other facilities. ANIMATION TEAM Very impressed with this animation team. They are professional and work hard. Some are very talented with the shows at night, and many will go out of their way during the day to involve guests in their structured activities. A few seemed to genuinely enjoy getting to know the guests, and would ask questions about what things are like where we are from. SHOWS Best I\u2019ve seen at an all-inclusive. Clearly not Vegas level, or even as good as what you\u2019ll see on a cruise ship, but talent, costumes, production far better than other resorts where I\u2019ve stayed. Theater itself is large and open with a roof, chairs around tables where wait staff will bring you drinks. There\u2019s also a bar. BEACH Very beautiful and clean beach. Whether you choose to snooze in the shade under one of the many huts, join a game of beach volleyball or sun yourself on one of the open lounges, there was plenty of room. They do play the towel game here and especially at the pool, so if you want a specific spot get up early and claim your chair. RESTAURANTS On a 1-10 scale, about a 4. The breakfast buffets were good with a large selection of pastry, made to order omelets, fruit. Lunch and dinner were repetitive, tasteless and not kept at appropriate temps. The a la cartes were better but not great. The beach restaurant opened for lunch offered stale nachos and rubbery burgers. BARS No pool bar, boo! If this were a newer resort, I\u2019m sure they\u2019d have planned for it. The beach bar was fine, lobby bar was a bit more upscale. Drinks were weak but they\u2019d make them stronger if you asked. Throwing a few bucks their way doesn\u2019t hurt. DISCO Small, dark, loud and lots of young people (including young children while we were there). EXCURSIONS We toured the Tulum Mayan ruins and snorkeled at Xel-Ha. The Tulum trip was interesting but long \u2013 a long bus ride and a long tour in the hot weather. I\u2019d rather not have been at the mercy of the guide so we could have left when we wanted to. Xel-Ha was cool (Lagoon snorkeling) but much more \u201ctheme-parkish\u201d than I\u2019d expected, with lockers for your clothes and snack bars on site. It reminded me of a more natural water country. PLAYA DEL CARMEN One day we took a taxi into town, another day we walked. We felt perfectly safe and did a little bargain shopping.

This hotel from top to bottom was amazing! From before we left we had a great start. I had emailed Eudys at guest services and asked if we could pre-book one of our ala cartes as my youngest son was really wanting to go so wanted to make sure we got reservations and after reading some comments I was worried if we waited we wouldn't get in, anyhow, reservation was made for us prior to arrival. I had also asked if our group could be close together and we were :) we had an ocean front room 2022-- BEAUTIFUL!!! there was a welcome note, beautiful flower arrangement and fruit basket upon our arrival! Our flight was delayed and we arrived late so room was ready and check in a breeze! buffet was closed when we got there and everyone hungery so we ordered room service! I've seen many reviews about the room service menu being horrible but really... it is more than sufficient! We ordered it almost every night, late night snacks, I think the kids just thought it was fun :) the resort is beautiful... we have stayed at the Gran Bahia, Grand Sunset Princess along with a few other hotels in the area but have to say, this hotel has exceeded all the others! The animals are so fun and you really never know what you will see....monkeys, peacocks, agoutis, iguanas, cranes, flamingoos, meer cat, tucans, parrots...I can go on and on... :) the service at this hotel was the best we have ever experienced... we didn't run into a single person that at the bare minimum didn't smile when we walked by! We do tip all the time, and everytime we did it was reciprocated with a genuine thank you and smile from the person, again whether it was restaurant staff, bartender, (Rafele at the beach bar made my day every day...he is so great and hope this hotel knows that) maid, etc. all looked you in the eye with a smile and thanks! Just a side note because I have read on here about things being stolen from rooms by maids, I have a very hard time believing that...one day we had left money out for them in the same place as always and it was not taken! we actually went lookinf for her to give it to her and we also left money out, by mistake, that was never touched except to place it in a neat pile. also electronics left out by mistake by the kids almost every day! I cannot comment on the hardness of the beds because ours in the suite was not, it was a new sealy mattress, same as we have at home and our group was in building 21 and no problems with hardd beds either? so not sure if they are changing them ??? the only thing I can say about the rooms is be very careful in the shower, they are VERY slippery....I myself actually slipped and broke my thumb. But have to say hotel was amazing.... I went to the hotel doctor and she wrapped it up and wanted me to go to hospital but I wasn't willing to have a cast on on this trip so did't go and the hotel manager came and found me to ensure I was ok and continued to do so throughout the week. I have also read many many reviews on here about how bad the food was and I have to say, i'm not sure what kind of food those people generally eat but the food was VERY good.... yes there are absolutely things that were not so great but don't eat them?! there were so many things that were amazing. We ate at 3 ala cartes, the japanese, italian, and steakhouse. Japanese was the one we were so looking forward to and have to say the food was the biggest disappointment. however, other people we met said it was amazing when they went so we probably just got a off night! and not that it wasn't good because it was, not not great! the italian was very good but the steakhouse was VERY VERY good and the service in the steakhouse exceeded everything! and our server made our last night one of the greatest we've ever had! I cannot remember his name and feel terrible! All the buffets were good, again no idea where the bad reviews come from cause we all found it to be very good! And last but not at all the least...the Starfriends.....wow...what can I say? they made our trip! A VERY special thank you to Natalia (who you would NEVER know only started a few days before we got there) and Carlos! You 2 are such amazing people and made my family feel so special and MADE our trip. And of course Maurico, Yohel, Govanani, Ricardo, and Edwardo you are all fantastic as well! :) These people bust their butt day in and day out with the most amazing smiles and attitudes.... I wish there was more I could say but if you go to this hotel you will know what I mean... I also intend to write the hotel about how fantastic these people are! in my opinion their shows were much better then the outside hired shows! and all the activities throughout the day...great!!!!! Again i've read the reviews about the evening entertainment being lame....ummmm really who are those people? we go to broadway plays many times a year at home and enjoy these shows more sometimes! we went to Cozumel as this is our 7th year back to the area and never been and have to say, huge disappointment...the ferry was $31 round trip which I thought was a lot. Don't get me wrong I am glad we went but can honestly say, would never go back... it's a very neat little place!. The beach is amazing at this hotel, first day we got a palapa but found it was further from the beach then we wanted to be so for the rest of the week, just got a umbrella from the towel hut and that way we were closer to the water.... we all thought the umbrella's were a great idea! never had them before from any other hotel! We had a larger group and never had problems finding chairs at the beach or pool! just a few random tips - ladies - do NOT wear heels, bring lots of $1 bills for tipping (as they more than deserve it), and although the resort isn't huge you do walk lots! If you have difficulties walking or are limited in any way this may not be the best place, last year we had our grandma's with us and all agreed this place would be very challenging for them. You can always walk on the perimeter but then you miss the jungle feel. We travelled from Vancouver with Nolitours and have to say we were very disappointed with Transats on board flight crew... they put a big damper on our flight there and back, just not nice and generally poopy attitudes from them all?? really not sure what that was about! However, besides that we had an amazing trip! Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions... I would recommend this place to anyone! although we don't usually stay at the same place we will 100% be back at this place next year, maybe even have my sisters wedding there :)", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Welland, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort\u201d", "Author": "Linda B", "ReviewID": "UR125589114", "Content": "When: February 14-21 FLIGHT: 4.5 Air Transat from Toronto: both flights on-time at leaving and return, 3.5- 3.75 hours flying time. Food: for airline) hot, decent quality; the service was good; for charter flight the leg room is very good \u2013 we asked for seats near the back where the rows with 3 seats become 2 seats \u2013 paid additional money for pre-booking the seat but it was money well-spent. SERVICE: 5. Special thanks to Omar (restaurant reservations); Rafael (beach bar) and Letecia (beach & pool wait staff); Ulisses (Hacienda and Cozumel restaurants); Martin (Tropicale - Caribbean restaurant at night, Uxmal by day); Angel (Steakhouse and Marimba); Luis (la Gondola and Cozumel); Madeleine (El Paso and cigar); and Armery (El Paso). CHECK-IN AND CHECK-OUT: 5. Smooth; there was a wait for the room but it was worth it - second floor, corner room, 21 block on the Riu side (we had no others complaints of its noise). ROOM (2127): 4.5. The mattresses were firm and comfortable. The 2100 block is steps to the beach, the dive centre, the pools, and a short walk through the \u2018jungle\u201d to the main buffet and lobby. The room and bathroom were kept clean and stocked; with different towel creature daily (Maty). Bathroom appears to have been updated; rest of the room \u2013 shelving rather than drawers, AC worked perfectly, no \u2018pests\u2019; only complaint is that the bar fridge kept the water, pop etc. cool only. GROUNDS: 5. Immaculately kept; trees, tropical plants, fountains and other water features are common to both Quetzal and Tucan resorts; with many animals and birds. Wear flat heeled shoes: the stone pathway through the grounds is uneven (definitely would not walk it at night with high heels) but is the best walk for seeing the monkeys; also, the boardwalk has wider gaps between the boards (again no or great care with heels). BEACH: 5. Beautiful. You can walk easily in both directions; the very wide beach is white powder sand in and out of the water; best beachfront. It is possible to see Cozumel and cruise ships in the distance. There are a number of palapas and you can sign out sun umbrellas to take closer to the beach. POOL(S): 5 One large multi-arm pool with a walk in shallow section (for children and exercises), one arm is about 5\u2019 deep with all other pool depths between 5\u20193\u201d-5\u20196\u201d. There is a children\u2019s wading pool near the swing and gym set; a water basketball-lap pool; and an adult pool, for which the primary purpose is to\u201dswim (walk) up\u201d bar. A Jacuzzi lies between 2 arms of the pool and the one arm of the pool has a fountain. ENTERTAINMENT: no rating The main show started at 9:30 PM. We enjoyed the Mexican night but did not see the other nights\u2019 shows. We would have liked more live and lively music in the bars (both Tucan and Quetzal) in the We appreciated the Star Friends easy manner and polite, not pushy manner; also, we liked that the beach & pool activities including music were not loud and incessant. A good mix of activities and quiet, relaxing time. RESTAURANTS: Overall Food Rating: 4 If you go each day at 1600 (4:00 PM) you can ask what a la cartes are open \u2013 we went to a la cartes 6 out of 7 nights. In order of personal preference: La Gondola 5. Went here for our anniversary \u2013 we are not sure whether it was Omar or Luis who made the arrangements \u2013 a cake with \u201chappy anniversary\u201d accompanied by a shooter (eye watering), and a flute of champagne-style wine. Try the lamb medium rare and ask for a side of pasta - - although the potato-spinach side was terrific as well). Long pants for men required. The Steakhouse 4 Had supper here two nights - - tenderloin, medium rare was excellent! Unfortunately the rib eye was not \u2013 too \u2018thin\u2019 a cut to grill well. The meal started with a battered onion and buffet appetizers. I would advise trying the Spanish coffee (no flames \u2013 for that need to go to La Hacienda - with an apple tart and ice cream. (During the day this is Marimba and a luncheon buffet. Good \u2013 closest to the long arm of the pool. La Hacienda 4: Another two nights here --- chicken the first night and the special tacos and beef kebab flamb\u00e9 the second followed by Spanish coffee (not on menus need to ask for it) \u2013 overall very good meals but with the chicken getting a mixed review (3 & 4); tacos and the beef kebob 4. Long pants required for men. La Tropicale: 4. This is primarily a fish restaurant \u2013 the grouper is very good and the snapper as well (although having sample both the grouper is preferred). The shrimp is excellent. Long pants not required for men. (During the day this is the restaurant nearest the beach and offers a good buffet with the burger grill outside \u2013 burgers are great\u2013 try them with guacamole with fresh salsa). Cozumel: (4) Open for buffet breakfast, lunch and supper. Breakfast was the best; lunch and supper offer very similar buffet foods, which were good, plentiful. The restaurant had more variety than the Uxmal or Marimba restaurants; lovely open-air surrounding (mesh keeps birds away. Open for a continental breakfast for early morning flights \u2013 a great touch. Re lunch buffets: Overall 4. The Uxmal and Marimba provide a lighter lunch variety than the Cozumel and are great for casual (dry) bathing suit and cover-up lunches). ALL RESTAURANTS ARE SUPER, SUPER CLEAN! Overall a great vacation - would highly recommend this all-inclusive. A beautiful place for couples and for families (we would definitely take our grand-daughter here for a visit).", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Foster City, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel in jungle-like setting\u201d", "Author": "SCUAmanda", "ReviewID": "UR125521164", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here for 8 nights in October. I had been meaning to write a review sooner, but better late than never, right? The lobby is beautiful. We arrived late at night and it was all lit up and there was music playing. When we checked in, they initially had us in a room with 2 double beds (we had requested a king when we made the reservation), so we asked for a king and they were able to accommodate our request. We originally were on the Tucan side closer to the ocean, but with the move to a king bed we ended up on the Quetzal side closer to the lobby which in this case was fine because a hurricane was supposed to hit in a few days. I believe they ended up moving most people in rooms near the ocean in toward the lobby for the hurricane anyway, so we didn't mind. The Tucan and Quetzal sides are pretty much the same, by the way, and you can go to restaurants and shops on either side. I'm not really sure why they have different names like different resorts - it is just like 2 halves of the same resort. A note about the hurricane - I think it was downgraded to a tropical storm at the last minute, but it didn't really impact our trip much. It rained off and on, but it was still warm and we still had plenty of time at the beach and in the pools. Also, it was kind of beautiful to watch the lightening and rain from our room the night it did hit. The staff kept us updated with a note about the most recent estimates on the storm and what services/restaurants would be affected. Also, the night after the storm we were expecting a mess when we came out of our room (it was super windy and pouring), but everything had already been cleaned up! And we wake up early! This is a huge credit to the staff here. They had everything looking beautiful again by the time their guests woke up. Our room was nice - super clean, nice big shower, and once we moved we had a nice big king bed. The beds were hard though as people mentioned so we asked for a mattress topper and it was put on the bed while we went to dinner. Housekeeping was great - everything was always very clean and they left us towel animals with flowers and chocolates every so often. The resort itself is gorgeous - as I mentioned the lobby is beautiful, the jungle-like area as you walk down to the pools and ocean is great, and the beach there is smooth and perfect for swimming. The lobby has everything you would need - a bar, souvenir shop with essentials like sunscreen that you may have forgotten, a jewelry shop, tequila store, and little stands set up for booking activities/tours/rental cars. The pool area is huge, and there is also an adult pool with swim-up bar. The jungle-ish area has peacocks roaming around, chickens, turtles, toucans, flamingos, and even monkeys that come out early in the morning. We enjoyed walking through it daily. This resort isn't as new-looking as some of the other resorts in the area, but is kept up very well and in my opinion is much better because of the jungle-like setting. I felt much more like I was on vacation in Mexico than on our last trip where the hotel was nice but reminded me of a big Las Vegas hotel. The restaurants here were great also. The buffet was average, but once you found the few things you liked you could just get that. You are never going to like everything at a buffet anyway. The Italian restaurant was really good - especially the appetizer buffet they had before you got your entree. The Mexican restaurant was also pretty good, but not our favorite oddly enough. The Japanese teppanyaki restaurant was our favorite. They cook the food right in front of you and everything is flavorful and fresh. We also had a reservation at the steakhouse but it wound up getting canceled because it was close to the ocean and the hurricane was coming. They did get us another reservation at the Italian restaurant instead though when they had to cancel. Also, you can get extra reservations almost every night if you want by just checking for cancellations daily. You really aren't limited to the amount of reservations that they allow. The Star Friends staff were really friendly and helpful. You really feel welcomed here. I also recommend going to the nightly shows that they put on - they are a lot of fun. This was a great hotel, and we hope to come back some day! Tips: -Ask for a mattress topper -Premium alcohol can be found at the bars in the lobbies (so our room near the lobby was kind of perfect actually) -It doesn't matter whether you stay on the Tucan or Quetzal side, you will spend time on both sides. -A little tipping goes a long way!", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cThird Time Lucky\u201d", "Author": "sarah912", "ReviewID": "UR125465241", "Content": "I have just returned from my third stay at this Iberostar.

I was concerned whether time may have worn the standard of this hotel down, but everything was perfect, and I was thrilled with the addition of coffee makers, gorgeous cappuccinos and the adult pool. This was my partners first trip and he was so impressed with everything. All of the staff work so hard to make your stay perfect, and seem so dedicated from those providing an obvious service to those more hidden like the groundsmen. When we were there there was a lot of seaweed being washed up but every morning it was raked up and buried. Everyone works so hard to keep it all spotless. I have no real helpful advise just wanted to add my comments as we were both so impressed, and I'm working out when I can get back for another fortnight of luxury. Only negative for the trip involves the travel agents...we travelled from the UK with thomas cook and were advised to take pesos - this is rubbish. Even the TC trips were priced in US dollars so we lost out on the exchange rate twice everywhere we went. We were also advised that there is no premium class on TC which is incorrect.

This was our third trip to Mexico. We arrived at the Hotel around 12:30, we were checked in without delay. With a sad face the staff stated they were overbooked for the week and upgraded us to a ocean front suite free of charge. Us and our luggage were given a golf cart ride to our room and we were in our room no longer the 20 min after our arrival Not sure what that had to do with being overbooked, but we were very pleased. Overjoyed with the service thus far we found the suite to very clean, spacious, and modern. The beds were reviewed as being to hard however we thought they were just right and slept very comfortably. Not sure if the suites have softer matteress. The first day the pool seemed somewhat cool, but as the weather got warmer over the next few days so did the pool and ocean temps. The resort is kid very kid friendly, so a couple looking for peace and quite might want to stay somewhere else. There is an adult pool, but it is small and in a shaded area because we enjoy the sun and the beach, we did not spend much time there. In order to get chairs either on the beach or by the pool, you must claim your sport by 10 AM, but the earlier the better. The practice of saving chairs by leaving towels or belongings on the chairs is frowned upon by the resort but it is the only way to get chairs. The pool is large but somewhat deep in all areas there is not a swim up bar in the main pool. This would be one of our only complaints. They had one small bar outside of the resturants between the beach and the pool that served both the Quetzel and Tucan. This bar was typically busy with a decent wait. I would typically put my shirt on and go to the beach side resturant and grab a couple drinks without waiting. The beach is fantastic very clean and spacious. They offer umbrellas at the towel check out you can put anywhere on the beach, so you can sit close to the ocean if you wish. The buildings are numbered from 2000 to 2900 with the 2000's being the suites closest to the beach and 2900's closest to the lobby/resutrants. We did send an email one week beofre arrival asking to be close to the beach, not sure if that had anything to do with our upgrade. It is a great 10 min walk from the beach to the lobby/resturant area though the jungle where you see numerous birds and other animals including monkeys. Many people had said they had been there for a week without seeing monkeys. We saw them everyday as we walked from the beach toward the lobby between 4-6 pm. As you wonder down the path you will come to an area where they do messages, hang out there for a few min and you will be sure to see them. There is a Mother with a baby monkey in tow that are fantastic to watch. As we made dinner reservations for Sat night we were pleased to find that you can check back everyday at 4 to see if there are available seating for that night. We were able to eat at a speciality resturant every night. The only down fall was they were later at night around 9 - 9:30, we typically eat earlier but this was ok with us, we just had to snack rather then eat in the early evening. Other then the towel game in the morning our only other complaint would be the food at the buffet, which is why we rate the Quetzel a 4 and not a 5. The food is ok at best. We have stayed at other resorts and would of rather ate at the buffett then the speciality resurants, however that was not the case here. We are somewhat pickey eaters, there is a large selection of food, however nothing to get excited about. Breakfast was the best for us. Again we are somewhat pickey, but we never went hungry that is for sure. The service was second to none. Our room was always cleaned early in the day. The entire staff was always helpful and greeted you with a smile. We had a issue with the safe upon arrival. Maintanence responded and corrected the issue within 5 min and we were on with our day. We traveld with Funjet who connects you with Lomas Travel, they provide all your ground transportation and excusions. All went off without a hitch. We did one excusion to Explor, which was a great day. You spend your day zip lining and in swiming in caves, with all you can eat/drink NO alcohol though, for good reason. The resort is a good 45 min from the airport. I would recomend non-stop transport to and from the airport. There is a activities staff called the Star Friends. They provide lots of activities during the day to keep you busy if you are intested in that. They also put on a show of some sort in the evenings.

The resort grounds are amazing, you see so much wild life, the grounds are kept beautiful and clean, do not wear heels, the pathway is uneven stones so it make it difficult to get around if you have heels. The hotel lived up to my expectation, i had requested a room by the beach (building 22-24) and we got 22, also requested bed topper and it was there. The rooms is small compare to other resorts, but very clean and comfortable. Their beach was the best maintained beach on that strip, every morning they would clean the seaweed, and rake the beach we would give them a 5+ for maintenance. What was nice is if you could not get a hut, they have beach umbrellas nice touch. The staff were very accomodating for any request we had and always pleasant, the one downside is there was insufficient wait staff on beach and bars making waiting for drinks fustrating, The food, unlike other resorts in the area, was substandard, the buffet was probably the worst we have experienced, not enought choices, always pretty much the same food no matter if you were in the main buffet or beach buffet. No pasta station, and the coffee was really bad. If you like good food, this is not your resort, we are not picky eaters so found something, but it was always the same. Did not like to have to plan our meals in advance but that was the only way to get a decent meal at the A La Carte restaurant. The Japanese Restaurant was good and entertaining. The steak house as everyone mentioned it the best. Note if you ask you will get it, they always bring margerine, so we asked for real butter and got it. Would we go again, no, perhaps we are tainted by the horrible travel experience with Sunquest and Thomas Cook, we were treated worse than cattle.

We ignore him and was still able to get on the cattle car. And to add insult to injury, on departure, Sunquest loaded everyone on the bus knowing full well that our flight home was delayed again by 5 hours.

With a bit of preparation and stocking up we had a nice holiday. Most reviews go on about BEDS and FOOD, both can be a horror story. BEDS - We must've been lucky last year as we had no problems with beds, this year the mattresses were rock hard and they only offered very uncomfortable foam tops. There are nice soft mattresses about in the hotel and in the end to we managed to swap the one my girlfriend had with my mum's who just could not sleep (by dragging the staff into the room and making them do it). It seemed that actually moving a mattress from room to room was little bit beyond what they were willing to do. Persist. FOOD - is bland to say the least, we brought our own pepper with us, but few tasty dishes can be found. After experience last year the first thing we went to buy was Lurpak butter in the Centro Maya supermarket (also get a plastic container to keep it in). Although they now have real butter for breakfast, instead of just margarine, both are horrible. Tasty dishes - lentil soup, most soups ok actually, bacon wrapped pork, wholemeal buns, bacon and eggs for breakfast, chicken in red sauce on tacos, blue tenderloin steaks and deep fried onion in the steakhouse (bring your own wine, see below), avocados, ice cream on the beach. Meat from the carvery counter at the main buffet is always dry. I guess part of the trick is to try and build normal meals and not mix everything up on the plate at the buffet. ALCOHOL - all is local headache stuff no matter what bottle it arrives in. Beers is consistent. Alcohol free cocktails better. Wine and champagne is not drinkable, but they don't mind if you bring your own (Supermarkets have good selection, at the top 'supermarket' end Chilean wines are significantly cheaper then in the UK). RECEPTION - if you have any requests (i.e. ground floor because of buggy), e-mail them and call them at least, even then they're likely to give you completely different rooms then what you've asked for, at least ours got sorted after 2 days. ENTERTAINMENT - Improved - shows and music is bit quieter which I welcome as it was my big gripe last year. We actually manged to sit through quite a few shows which are lot better then in the neighboring hotels. Cartoon show in particular has costumes kids will love (Nemo,Toy Story etc.). On the beach - they've added another volleyball court (2 now), which is great, you'd have small tournament of 4+ teams going every morning. Zumba on the beach was also fun as well as the numerous competitions and parties. Mariachi at the main buffet aim to please, do field a request for a particular song, the ensuing cacophony of instruments will be hilarious and worth the tip. BIKES - Improved - rental now possible in front of Tucan. Last year it was just bike tour. INTERNET - get your own, see here http://www.prepaidgsm.net/forum/americas/6685-mexico-ipad-2-prepaid-data-success-telcel.html TRANSFERS - we organized our own privately with www.playa.info.

They are all so warm, friendly, and helpful, and the \"star friends\" enthusiasm never wavers! The nightly entertainment was always fun, and something different every night. The buffets had plenty of delicious food and a good variety. We also ate at the Bonsai (Japanese), Uxmal (tropical) and the Steakhouse restaurants. No complaints with any of those either. There's plenty of activities to keep you occupied--so much so, you may never want to leave!--as well as lounging beside the huge pool or on the gorgeous beach. The grounds of the hotel are really quite beautiful, set in amongst a jungle full of all kinds of birds and wildlife. We never tired of watching them. The grounds are well-maintained, clean, and the resident birds and animals seem to be very well cared for. The only downside, for us, was the occasionally noisy rooms (the rooms are tiled and it seems as if you can hear a pin drop three rooms away, and not everyone was cognizant that there were others trying to sleep) and the excessive smoking. Although the buffet restaurants had large no smoking areas, the rest of the resort seemed to be wide open for smoking, and it was hard to escape. It's doubtful any of the rooms would be far enough away that you couldn't hear the nightly entertainment, but they did end it at around 11:00 pm, even at the neighbouring resorts. We stayed in building 24, top floor, overlooking the trees, the occasional monkey, and a nice pond and waterfall. And it was always fun to return to the room to see what kind of \"towel creature\" had been left for us by the cleaning staff!

Some nights their nightly entertainment was loud, but we travel with a fan for background noise for the kids, so it didn't really bother us. The location couldn't be beat. Our beds were not hard by any means, not sure if they were different in other rooms/buildings. My only small complaint is the depth of the pool. The main pool is very large and 95% of it is over 5 feet deep. There is a separate (small) kids pool which my kids loved, but I would have liked if we could have used the big pool more.

This was our third visit to this resort (second time with our son), and it continued be be as nice as we remembered it. I had emailed in advance, and our room request was honored for the most part (we got the building, bed arrangement, and direction of the room requested, but were put on the main floor as opposed to an upper level). Ultimately, being on the ground floor proved to be quite convenient for us, although a couple of nights, it sounded like there was an elephant walking in the room above us! (not the fault of the hotel) The beds are hard, as everyone points out, and this year we didn't have the mattress toppers, but were so tired at the end of the day, we all slept very well anyway. The room was clean and cool. One negative was in regards to housekeeping - there were 3 days where we were not provided with replacement facecloths, and after we used up the large bottle of water for brushing teeth etc, it was never replaced, so we used the smaller water bottles in the fridge for that - not a big deal. The jungle continues to look beautiful, and the beach is by far the best in the area. We sat on the Quetzal side, and since that is where the dive boats come and go from, there were never any beach chairs in front of us, so we always had a fabulous view of the water. We had to walk a few feet over to swim in the ocean, but that gave us a chance to drip dry when coming back to our chairs. All of the beach activities take place in the middle of the beach, so if you want action, stay in that area. The beach bar was always busy, but there was also a waitress taking orders if you didn't want to get up yourself. The staff were all wonderful - everyone greeted us when passing on the trails, and were very friendly. Special mention of Mauricio of the Star Friends - he became my son's best Amigo while we were there, and my son loved seeing him every day. In the buffet restaurant, all of the staff were great, but David always went out of his way to chat with my son and ensure we never had to wait for refills of drinks. Our son enjoyed the kids club every evening at 8 pm - I think it was fun for those kids in the 3 - 7 age range, but any older, and the games would seem too simple I think. There was a mix up in dinner reservations on our last night - I had requested the Japanese reataurant, but was given the Italian - not sure why I didn't check the ticket more closely, so I have to take some of the blame myself - but we still had a great meal. We also ate at the Steakhouse (always great), and enjoyed the Tropical as well (the shrimp were fabulous). The buffets always had something, even for the fussy eater in our family. We found the buffet on the Tucan side was usually quieter and more relaxed for both breakfast and supper, and the food is the same. At lunch we tended to eat at the beachside restaurant and often had the hamburgers hot off the grill. I know it's been mentioned in many other reviews, but ladies, don't bother wearing spiky heeled shoes - you'll have a hard time managing the jungle paths or the wood path on the Quetzal side. We really weren't bothered by any vendors on the beach - there were people walking around selling jewelery or cigars, but they didn't pester you if you didn't take an interest. Same for the staff offering massages or spa services - they were friendly and didn't hassle you if they remembered you from a previous day. We had pictures taken with all the animals, and also did a family photo shoot with the photographer from the resort. I did feel pressure from the photographer when I went to see the photos - she offered me a \"deal\" for $800 US, and seemed put off when I only selected 7 shots (which was still $105 US). I didn't like how obviously unimpressed she was with my order - and I wonder - if it's not your wedding, do people actually spend $800 on vacation photos? We ordered room service for our son twice, and were very pleased with the speed of service, and how hot the food was when it arrived. We also have to compliment the bell boy for how quickly he came to pick up our luggage when we were leaving. After 3 times at the same resort, we have already decided to return there next winter, because why be disappointed by a place you don't know, when this resort has everything we need for a wonderful vacation.", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lewiston, Utah", "Title": "\u201cLoved the gounds\u201d", "Author": "Ttjensen2", "ReviewID": "UR124531232", "Content": "Beautiful grounds.

Service staff is fantastic and here is a summary of all aspects of the resort. We recommend this resort to everyone. Adults, families\u2026you will be impressed by the beauty of this jungle environment. They will go out of their way to make sure you have a good trip. Room: We were in building 29 which was furthest from the beach. Let's face it, we booked Tuesday and arrived on Friday...I wasn't going to complain. This room was comfortable, clean, spacious and on the third floor as I requested. They are quiet. I felt like there was no one else in the building. Although we were near the entrance of the resort, we did not hear cars unless we were on the balcony overlooking the beautiful lush jungle environment. I think third floor is a good idea as lower you might get more humidity. We had no odor or mustiness in our room it was perfect. The bathrooms are modern with a large shower stall. There is no tub, but we do not take baths so that is not a problem. There is a safe. We had to call to get it re-set, but they came right away and everything worked smoothly for the rest of the week. There is plenty of closet space. Television was great, but we aren't there to watch tv. Our building was right next to the disco, but we barely heard anything except for some people leaving, but you would hear people going back to their rooms wherever you are on the resort so it was not a problem. The air-conditioning is extremely efficient and the quietest I have ever seen. Building 29 may be furthest from the beach but walking through the jungle every day is an adventure because you are meeting peacocks, agouti, coatis, iguanas, monkeys, chickens, ducks, swans, turtles...so many I am sure I am missing something...it is sooo interesting. This building is right near the lobby, lobby bar, the dinner reservations desk, buffet, excursion booking, tennis courts, spa, bicycle rentals, main street if you want to walk to market or Playa del Carmen. Therefore I didn't mind the location at all. Beach: In our opinion the beach was the best on Playacar. They work so hard to get rid of the grass that showed up a few days during the week, but it isn\u2019t slimy greasy seaweed, it is more rigid and if you encounter some in the water it isn\u2019t creepy. The water was warm and clean and beautiful. You can walk to the left and you will notice when you walk past the other hotels that their beach chairs do not go past the lifeguard chair\u2026which means they are pretty far from the water. At the Iberostar, not only can you drag your beach chairs close to the water, but you can get a parasol from the towel rental and you are set for the day and you can protect yourself if you have had enough sun or like me you are sun-sensitive. This is a huge bonus in my opinion. There are barely any vendors on the beach and they are very respectful and not annoying at all. There is someone selling silver jewelry, the parasailing guys and sometimes the women from the spa asking if you would like a massage. Walking on this beach is a dream as there are no rocks at all. We played volleyball every day. There are other activities on the beach and in the pool area (salsa dancing, Zumba ect.). If you want to have fun, there is plenty to do, but if you just want to sit and read a book quietly, no problem. There is no music blaring all day like we noticed at other resorts. The animators are all friendly and they work very hard to make sure everyone is having a good time. Dressel Dive Shop \u2013 We were able to book a snorkeling expedition for $40 US. They take you out 15 minutes to the Inah reef where you snorkel for an hour. We saw fish, rays and a giant turtle that was so beautiful and unreal. We felt like we were in a Disney movie. The guide would dive deeper and pick up sea urchins, star fish and other sea creatures. It was worth every penny. We also would take a couple of kayaks out (singles or tandem) when the wind cooperated. Our best outing was when we went straight out to the buoy and came back easily with the waves behind us. It was a lot of fun. We should have taken a catamaran refresher lesson at the beginning of the week so that we could use them whenever we wanted. The course is $40.00 and would have been worth it\u2026oh well. Restaurants: The buffet restaurant \u2013 we only went there for breakfast and our first night. The breakfasts are fine. They only had bananas two mornings, but the rest of the time we always ate way too much. You can have made to order omelets, crispy bacon, beans, sausages, fresh fruit, many different kinds of bread, yogurts, donuts, pancakes, waffles, French toast\u2026I could go on and on\u2026you will not starve. For dinner, I can\u2019t comment too much because we were exhausted the first night. The wine was horrible\u2026seriously foul. One night we walked through after our dinner at an \u00e0 la carte and they had a lovely roast beef and a crown roast of pork. It looked really good. El Bonsai Restaurant \u2013 Japanese \u2013 This is a show. The food is decent, however very salty\u2026they add salt and plenty of soya sauce. It was quite good, but not my favourite. You are with a group. It is a fun atmosphere and you get to meet other people. Fun to watch. We had a combo (octopus, chicken, beef and shrimp). La Gondola restaurant \u2013 Italian \u2013 This was the best restaurant at the resort. We are not pasta people so we didn\u2019t even eat pasta. We went twice. The service and food was excellent. The appetizer buffet had smoked salmon, wonderful cheeses and many interesting selections. The wine was quite good too. We absolutely loved the lamb chops, rib-eye steak and the red snapper with mussels. All meats were cooked medium rare to perfection and the fish was excellent too. I recommend this restaurant to all. The Tropical restaurant \u2013 Seafood \u2013 Was OK. I had the red snapper and my husband had the shrimp. I could taste the garlic powder (not fresh garlic) and it was kind of overpowering and not great. It was my least favourite \u00e0 la carte. La Marimba Steakhouse \u2013 Very good food. Appetizers (salad) were tasty and the steak was cooked perfectly. This was our second favourite \u00e0 la carte. La Hacienda Restaurant \u2013 Mexican \u2013 We had a pretty good meal here. My husband had the beef skewers flamb\u00e9ed with Tequila. I had some sort of pineapple chicken tacos that were very tasty\u2026but they were tacos. The beef skewers were a little tough, but it was a decent meal. The lunch buffets on each side of the beach (the steakhouse and tropical restaurants are lunch buffets during the day) were wonderful. The sea bass, roast chicken, nachos with different kinds of salsas, hamburgers (outside) were delicious. The chili, paella one day, margaritas all made our lunches tremendous! Loved it! Top all that off with delicious cappuccinos\u2026are we in heaven? Don't forget to get your hard ice cream near the beach bar. The coconut is fantastic, the mango is great too! Shows \u2013 I am not a fan of resort shows. I am usually too tired to enjoy them. My husband enjoyed the magic show and we both enjoyed a tribute to the Academy awards. They work very hard to put on a good show. Ok, in all fairness 4.5 would probably be my rating however the only things that knocked off the .5 were not an important reflection of the week we spent here. The only negatives were: We waited over an hour to check in because they seemed a bit disorganized and short-staffed at that moment. They were very polite and seemed genuinely sorry for the delay. Have a drink and relax after your trip. The beds are uncomfortable (hard), but if you order your foam topper straight away, this will not be an issue. Housekeeping came and brought me one on the 2nd day and it helped a lot. I believe oceanfront rooms have more comfortable beds as I spoke to some people who mentioned that there beds were great. The tennis courts are a little strange, but that will only interest a small percentage of people who play. We managed to enjoy them nonetheless. The buffet wine is virtually undrinkable. All in all you will definitely not regret choosing this resort.

We always stay at Iberostars, so we knew what to expect. We were positively surprised. Iberostar Quetzal was the best one we visited so far. We were a party of 5 or as we used to say 4 \u00bd as we traveled with a 20-month-old daughter. She was crazy about the resort. She was crazy about the people. If you are planning on going to Mexico with a toddler, this is a place to stay. I couldn\u2019t believe how fast she was learning over there. New words popping out of her mouth every 5 minutes. She adored agoutis and peacocks. We felt very safe in Quetzal and Playacar is a gorgeous gated community. Perfect for long walks with a baby. We requested building 21 through the email that I sent 2 weeks prior to our arrival. We also requested 2 rooms next to each other with king beds. Also we wanted rooms facing the pool. Our request was not granted. We ended up in building 24, with two rooms one with king bed and one with 2 double beds. Our rooms were facing quite noisy RIU resort. I specifically asked for a crib to be ready in a room and everything got mixed up in their system and our toddler was treated like an adult and she was supposed to be sleeping in a double bed. This was front desk\u2019s explanation as to why we got a room with two beds. When asked to be moved to two rooms with king beds, we were told that the only option was building 29 and we were advised to inquire about it again in 2 days. I have to admit that check-in was the only part of our stay that I didn\u2019t like. I was a bit disappointed in a way the things were handled. I was just used to our room requests being granted. The rooms were nice and clean, but I must agree with other reviewers that they are dated. We love hard beds, so no complaints about that. Room d\u00e9cor was nice and gave us that \u201cvacation feel\u201d immediately. Our mini bar was restocked every day. We had plenty of bottled water for the baby. For the first time we used tap water to brush our teeth and nobody got sick. We were advised that they now have water purification system. The food was really good. When we go to AI resorts we don\u2019t expect gourmet food but the food quality and variety was good. Every night at the Taco Station there was something different and the food was really authentic. This was our firs time to try tripe and beef tongues on our tacos - really tasty. You may find the food a bit repetitive but I think that if you restrain yourself and try not to taste everything during the first two days, you will go happy. We tried 2 specialty restaurants: Tropical and Mexican. We loved the first one. If you\u2019re a fan of seafood, this is your place. Octopus and shrimp ceviche were awesome. We particularly enjoyed palm hearts appetizer. We all had fish and we were all happy with our dishes. I really loved my red snapper in coconut. Tropical indeed. We didn\u2019t really like Mexican restaurant. It was sub-par at most. The waiter seemed to be in a hurry and the food was really mediocre. We loved the Mariachis. They played beautifully to our order. My parents in law were also able to try Japanese restaurant and according to them the food was good but they especially enjoyed the show. We enjoyed the evening shows. Again, I wouldn\u2019t expect the entertainment at AI to be ambitious and challenging and I think it was just perfect for a relaxing evening in the tropics. If we want to see an opera we do it at home. If we want to have fun during our vacations \u2013 we watch Star Friends show with drinks in our hands. We booked with Funjet and since their flight with Aeromexico was a charter, they tried to put on it as many people as possible. We got the most narrow seat row on the whole plane it was row#22. We specifically checked, they gave us the smaller space available and we were flying with a baby. It was too late to switch seats and I doubt it would be possible, because the flight was full. We complained about it to Lomas Travel employee, Marisol, who took care of everything and on our flight back we were put in a first row with plenty of legroom. Thank you Marisol! I will be writing another review for Dressel Divers (very positive one), but I would just like to mention that they were awesome. We did 7 dives with them and we couldn\u2019t be happier.

Superb cappuccinos, and espresso\u2019s, especially if you ask for a shot of Bailey\u2019s Irish cr\u00e8me on the side! Buffet \u2013 One of the better buffet\u2019s, but face it \u2013 after a week, you will get tired of any buffet. Coming from the Midwest, they offer fruits that we don\u2019t often see \u2013 Papaya, Passion Fruit, Cactus, Mango, etc. Restaurants Steak \u2013 Excellent, our group tried Rib eye, Salmon, and Tenderloin, all were wonderful. Tropical \u2013 most disappointing, salads and appetizers left something to be desired. Bonsai \u2013 beginner cook, but the food was excellent, and the bartender in the restaurant top notch! Read a few complaints about the hard beds, we didn't have any issues, nor did anyone in my group. $7 cab ride into town, they drop you off by the high end shops close to the ferry. If you are shopping in Playa be ready for the usual calling from the merchants. It does get old after a few days\u2026. but most are friendly and take no for an answer. Always enjoy a day trip over to Cozumel, shopping and a cab ride to eat lunch at Ernesto\u2019s fajita\u2019s. The absolute best anywhere! Beach, clean and beautiful. Very few vendors to bother you, and most vendors were associated with the hotel pushing their parasailing, or jet skiing.

It was our second time at an Iberostar Resort, and like the resort in Punta Cana, it did not disappoint. The grounds were absolutely beautiful. We saw and heard the monkeys daily. We upgraded to a beachfront room which was was well worth the money. With two children it was nice to have the extra sleeping space, plus we were able to hear the ocean waves at night. Not sure where the complaints come from about the beds. I prefer a soft bed and I thought mine was perfectly fine. The rooms were very nice, no complaints there. The room service was great. If you want them to restock daily I would recommend a small tip. The beach was beautiful but I have to say, not as beautiful as Punta Cana. We never had a problem finding chairs. I was a bit disappointed that there was not a typical \"beach bar\" but it was no big deal. We were approached a few times on the beach asking if we would like a drink, but do feel the beach was understaffed. The pool was awesome, breathtaking. Again, I feel a bit understaffed compared to the service we had in Punta Cana. The swim up bar was disappointing and not much to look at. The bartender, Iray, was great. As far as the food goes, we all really enjoyed the buffet. There was something for everyone and every night was a bit different. The breakfast buffet was awesome. My parents ate at the Italian restaurant and were not overly impressed. I heard the steak house was very good and wish we would have tried it. Our friends ate at the Mexican restaurant and didn't care for it at all. The drinks at the hotel were very good. Try a bloody mary at the front bar! Also in the morning they make great Cappuccino and Latte's. I had to see a doctor due to a bug bite. They have two on staff. Both are great and speak perfect English. The last day I tried Scuba. I am so bummed I didn't try it earlier! The dive staff are great! My kids were in heaven. The staff was so nice to them. They didn't discover the Kids Club until almost the end of our trip but once they did wanted to go back. They LOVED Mauricio! They have awesome entertainment for the kids in the evening and the adult entertainment is good as well. My number one compliment goes out to Lomas Travel. Our representative at the hotel was Jose. While on our trip my dad ended up having terrible back issues and ended up in the hospital. Jose was very concerned and immediately sent over a wonderful woman from Lomas named Sugely to the Hospital. As soon as she arrived she did everything she could to make sure my dad was comfortable and had his needs met. She worked overtime to take my mom back to the hotel to get the things she needed. She communicated with the staff at the hospital to make sure my parents were safe and in good hands. She was very concerned and showed the utmost compassion to my parents. Without her and Lomas travel I do not believe we would yet be back in the United States. I believe Lomas was contracted through Fun Jet. I will always, from here on out, use Fun Jet and Lomas where available.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing!!\u201d", "Author": "Shlaky", "ReviewID": "UR123629782", "Content": "We just got back from a week stay at Iberostar Tucan, and it was an extremely enjoyable vacation!

The rooms very always clean with little swans or some sort of cute animals made out of towels on the bed, no doubt for the kids lol.

They were fun to watch and kid friendly, although some were more for an adult audience. The magic show was awesome!

We are a couple both 36 and traveling without kids. Checkin: we arrived at the hotel around noon. We were told that room wasn't available until 2:30, returned at that time and room was available. Service was friendly and they spoke English very well. She warned us very clearly about phone charges and how the beach towel service worked. Room: very clean with nice polished stone (marble?) flooring. Air conditioning was powerful enough to keep room plenty cool. There was a small rattle that we eliminated by jamming some paper under the grille. Was a pretty minor noise though. Bathroom was nice and had a large shower with tiled walls. There was no tub. We didn't care cause neither of us like taking baths. Beds, as mentioned, are quite hard. And small, we had 2 doubles. We got a mattress topper but had to ask 4 times :-/ but we did finally get one. We were on the ground floor and did find it a bit noisy with people walking and talking in hallway. Would maybe recommend a second or third floor for this reason, may be less traffic... Also building location is something to consider. We were in building 22xx. Was nice because it close to the beach. Although, if you have any kind of difficulty walking, I would choose something closer to lobby and main restaurants. The walkway in the \"jungle\" is a little uneven and not super well lit at night. That makes it kind of nice actually but could make it challenging for some. We also noticed a woman with high heels having trouble on walkways near lobby because of the large spacing between the walkway boards (almost an inch I'd say). Food: we ate at 4 of the a la carte, The 2 buffets and both beach snack bars. Check the hours of the main buffets when you arrive, this will be very helpful cause your daytime food options outside of these buffets aren't great (beach snack bar is kind of weak). You can only reserve 3 a la carte in advance, BUT you can come back any day that you don't have a reservation between 4-8pm and see what is available. Buffets: no complaints. Lots of variety. Also the nice thing is they had a taco station with some pretty authentic Mexican trimmings including some spicy roasted chili mixes. Certain things are a little weak like the pizza but I think that is meant to please kids palates, which I think it would. Charcuterie (sliced meats and cheeses) were not outstanding but who cares, there was tons of other good stuff. Mexican: ate here twice. Very good service and food. Appetizer was buffet style, main wad served and dessert was buffet style. Dessert was similar selection to dessert in main buffet so I could say that's a little weak but we still enjoyed TE overall experience. Japanese: I don't think I'll go back to a Japanese restaurant again in a resort. The food was ok... The chefs gave a good show. But we were cramped in really tight. We didn't like the taste of the soup but that could just be personal taste. We never receive our tempura course even though half the table got theirs?... The main that you get served is just some meat, rice and veggies that they fry on the griddle in front of you. I don't find it a great food experience. Funny things is though, the best dessert of the trip was the tempura banana that we had there for dessert. One positive thing about the Japanese restaurants is that it's a good opportunity to socialize with other guests. Steak House: this was our favorite. I wasn't expecting good steak but it was awesome. Thick cut grilled right! Italian: was ok, we both had fettuccini carbonara. It was nice fresh pasta but sauce was kind of dry and bland. Beach snack bar: we did go here much cause there wasn't much selection. Beach: was amazing, clean sand, clear water with nice sandy bottom. Beach is long. You can walk for about 20min south and we walked all the to playa del Carmen going north. We never had problems finding beach chairs or shade. Drinks: probably our biggest complaint of the trip. Mixed drinks sucked. Tropical drinks were basically very artificial tasting syrup based slushies with a very small amount of alcohol. My girlfriend found that they use real bananas in the banana daiquiris so that was her favorite I think. I mostly went for beer (light sort of lager fine for the sun) and mojitos (which were great) Service: other than having some trouble getting the mattress topper, the service was awesome. Location: couldn't ask for better. Nice walk to playa del Carmen. You can get there either on nice boulevard or on beach. Cab ride is $70pesos. Tipping: I can't understand how FEW people tip?! The cost of these trips is mind boggingly cheap. Would it kill you to spend an extra $100 in tips for a week? Also, get Mexican pesos. Regardless of what your travel agent says, get the currency that is used in that country. If you want to show your appreciation, don't make them have to stop at the bank and convert their tips. There is even a sign on front desk saying they don't accept USD. I find it kind of arrogant to assume that USD is what they want. I don't think the bar tender buys his groceries in USD... Even though I have some negative comments, we had a wonderful time. And would return to this hotel for sure. We also sneaked into the Riu next door (Riu Playacar I think). From what we saw of that resort, we felt like we were in a 6star resort in comparison. That place, from simply walking around, seemed far inferior. Of course didn't taste food or see the rooms but that was our impression. Made us really happy that we chose the iberostar over the Riu.

The only things I would change is that the outside bar by pool should have some chairs around so you could hang out there and not just order, also, they should have had the swim up bar in the big pool, or add one, and add some tables and chairs outside the restaurant by the beach so more people could enjoy their food outside at a table. Other than that, I would highly recommend.

NOT HASSLED at all, just more of an FYI if we were interested. We waited about 5 minutes and our shuttle was there ready to take us to our hotel.

This is our third time at an all inclusive. I chose this resort based on comparing reviews on Tripadvisor and other sites. Complaints seemed few and minor and most reviews were positive. The chance to see the animals in the \"jungle\" area was a big draw for me. We did see monkeys with their baby outside our room the first day, and saw them a few more times throughout the resort. Food: We ate in the main buffet, the poolside buffet/grill, and in the Japanese and Steakhouse restaurants. Our first meal on Saturday at the buffet was below average, but perhaps it was an off night, because all other meals at both buffets were good. I tended to stick with mexican/mayan food, fish, pork and side dishes. Beef was usually tough in the buffets, but the pork was better. The chicken wings, of all things, were the best I've had (no sauce and crispy). I approached the buffets not expecting top quality gourmet food (it is an all-you-can-eat buffet, after all), and except for the first meal, I was never disappointed. I thought the variety was quite good and the staff did a good job keeping the stations and dishes full. Breakfasts were very good. I tried a little bit of a lot of dishes, and a few of them I did not care for, but I found such variety that I always found plenty that I liked. The Japanese restaurant: This is hibachi style (about 12 people sit around a grill while the chef cooks for everyone) which I had forgotten about. I was anticipating a quiet dinner, and it was not. If you know what to expect, don't worry. If you like to meet new people over dinner, this is a great opportunity. You are presented with a very limited menu - basically you get a sushi appetizer, choose soup or tempura veggies, white or fried rice and choice of meat (s): chicken, shrimp, beef, octopus. There was a problem with slow service at our dinner. One person at the table had an allergy to a seasoning, so the cook made all of this person's food first and then made everyone else's food, so basically, you had to sit through the cooking of the dinner twice. It took a very long time between courses. Seatings were staggered by the 1/2 hour, and the group that came in 30 min. after us were finished before we were. While it is understandable that the restaurant should accomodate a food sensitivity, the cook/manager should have found a better way to handle the matter. Additionally, I don't think our cook was the fastest cook either, which did not help. Anyway, food was good, beef was very good and tender. But I would not go to this one again. Steak house: We really enjoyed this one. Steak was very good. I had tenderloin - it was a large serving and delicious; hubby had ribeye and he liked it very much. there is a small appetizer buffet, so you do get to have some choices. The atmosphere was quieter. I would definitely do this restaurant again. Drinks - I did not care for the house red wine. I found it undrinkable, but hubby did not. Alcoholic drinks are mostly pretty light on the alcohol, and most of the frozen drinks are made with an average quality mix. However, we found that mojitos and mai tais were good bets. Mai tais actually have quite a bit of alcohol and are tasty. You can always order a mixed drink or something on the rocks, but the frozen drinks leave a lot to be desired. For a good made from scratch (fresh pineapple and cream of coconut) go to Playa del Carmen and go to La Pinata bar near the beach. Beach - simply beautiful, great sand, clean beach Beach chairs - You have a good choice if you go before 9 or 10 am, after that, chairs fill up, but we always found one in the shade. You can also get an umbrella at the towel station to take to the beach. We missed most of the entertainment, since we are early risers and can't stay up with the big kids. Service - all around it was excellent. The rooms were clean and everything worked. Housekeeping missed a few minor things (no coffee refill one day), but overall it was good. The mattresses are indeed quite firm, but I slept fine every night. Bring your own hair conditioner, ladies. We had requested a room overlooking the jungle (emailed a month prior). I don't think the reservation people got the memo, because we were a building near the pool. However, they did accomodate our request with no problem, it just took about 30 minutes for them to find another room. We got a room on the first floor in bldg. 24, overlooking the jungle. I liked the location very much - about halfway between the beach and the buffet, and it was a quiet location facing the jungle area. Lastly, I highly recommend the Dressel diving shop - we learned scuba and the staff and instructors are wonderful.

The check-in process was a bit slow, as there were 16 people who arrived on the same airport shuttle. There were only two staff handling the check-in process \u2013 an additional staff member would have greatly sped up the process. We had requested a third floor room in either building 23, 24 or 25. Our request was granted, and we were assigned room 2347. I had asked for foam mattress toppers as well, but these were not in our room upon arrival (we ended up getting them the following day). As other reviewers have mentioned, the beds are extremely hard and the foam offers a small improvement. Our room was generally very clean, but we did notice a few tiny ants near the coffee maker and in the bathroom. Not a big deal. The mini-bar was restocked every two days with bottled water, beer, and pop (Coke, Diet Coke, Fanta Orange, Sprite, soda water). Plenty of bath towels were provided. We liked our room location as it was near the pool. We could hear the music every night from the live entertainment but it was usually over by 10:00 p.m. Our children were in bed by 8:00 p.m. every night but the music never kept them awake. The grounds are lovely, with beautiful pathways through the jungle area. Wildlife was abundant and our children really enjoyed seeing the peacocks, monkeys, iguanas, turtles, flamingos, swans, ducks, agouti etc. The best time to see the animals was early in the morning (our children are early risers so we were usually out walking around by 6:45 a.m.). We kept hearing a weird, catlike howl in the middle of the night and finally figured out that it was the peacocks. I think this has been mentioned in a past review but it's worth repeating - there is a wooden walkway that you have to take to get to the buffet restaurant. The boards are not tightly spaced (gaps of about an inch wide in some places) so it would be tricky to navigate this with high heels. The wood also had a high gloss finish which looked like it could be slippery if wet. The pool area was very nice with lots of seating. The pool is not heated though, and we found it cold. We preferred to swim in the ocean, which was warmer (or at least, it seemed warmer). Despite signs everywhere prohibiting people from reserving chairs, this was a daily occurrence. There were several families in particular (you know who you are) who came down to the beach before 7:00 a.m. every day and reserved huge groups of chairs under the palapas, and then didn\u2019t actually come down to the beach until close to 11:00 a.m. Very, very rude. I wish the hotel had enforced its policy of removing people\u2019s items but I never saw this happen. I wish I was brave enough to remove people\u2019s towels \u2013 maybe next time :) The beach itself was gorgeous although again, the behaviour of some inconsiderate guests who treated the beach like their own personal ashtray/garbage can was unbelievably rude. There were ashtrays and garbage cans everywhere, but people couldn\u2019t be bothered to walk 10 feet to dispose of their garbage. I also had a pair of Rockport sandals stolen while I was swimming \u2013 I am positive it was another guest (best of luck to you with those shoes \u2013 they are super uncomfortable and you may notice the bloodstains from where the straps constantly rubbed my feet raw. Enjoy!). There was a decent selection of food at the buffet, although it did get repetitive. We ate at the buffet restaurant closest to the beach one day and decided that the Cozumel buffet at the Quetzal was much better so we went back there for the remainder of our trip. Our 7 year old son is a very picky eater but there was always something that he would eat. We particularly enjoyed the buffet breakfast as there were delicious donuts (still warm), as well as made-to-order omelets and a huge variety of fresh fruit juices (watermelon was my favourite). We ate at two of the specialty restaurants: the Japanese restaurant and the Steak House. The Japanese restaurant was good, and we enjoyed the show. The sushi appetizer was weird \u2013 I can\u2019t put my finger on exactly why but we didn\u2019t enjoy it very much. The main meal was quite good though. While we enjoyed our dinner at the Steak House, my daughter and I became very ill after eating there (we shared a steak). In fact, my daughter vomited in bed that night, and it took two phone calls to get fresh sheets for the bed and we waited over an hour for them to be delivered. That was on our very last night at the hotel, so it was a bit of a disappointing end to what was otherwise a great holiday.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, Washington", "Title": "\u201cThis was our first of three area vacations-Iberostar Quetzal, Iberostar Cozumel and Allegro Cozumel\u201d", "Author": "capran", "ReviewID": "UR122950825", "Content": "This was our first visit to the area in December 2010.

The breakfast pastrey in a loaf form is to die for. The beach beautiful, although beach chairs were quickly snatched up. The pool was cool and didnt see alot of use. The location perfect. You could walk the beach to the Playa del Carmen pier, we took the bike tour to town and took a cab one way and walked the other. You can walk south on the beach and while not totally isolated, pull up a stretch of sand without someone right next to you. The beach is beautiful, but not much to see in the water. The catamaran great fun. Drinks were good, entertainment, at times alittle cheesey, but with great energy, and some shows excellent. It's obvious they have a high standard of workers.

I went in December for a week on my honeymoon. Everything was absolutely amazing. The grounds are breathtaking, the service is the best I have ever had, and we had the time of our lives! I will start with the room. We were in a 2nd floor room with balcony overlooking the jungle. The room was perfectly clean every day and our mini fridge was refilled every other day. The towel art was wonderful every day. I've heard complaints about the beds but we didn't have an issue at all. I do usually like my bed a little firmer than other people, but it really didn't seem very firm to me. However, I have read reviews saying to just ask for a mattress topper and they will bring you one. I'm sure they will because the service is great. The grounds were spectacular. The resort is filled with windy rock paths through the jungle. Along the way you see peacocks, pheasants, monkeys, agouti, and coati! The animals will eat right from your hands! The coati were my favorite. The peacocks will jump up onto people's balconies, even up to the third floor! There are fountains and ponds everywhere. In front of the regular buffet are two waterfalls with a big pond between them with swans and ducks. There is also another pond with flamingos. Walking through the jungle every morning when the animals are most active (7-9 ish) was so much fun and the perfet way to start the day. We did not have any issue with mosquitoes, also some people talked about the paths being dark but they were all lit. I would like to note that Quetzal side is definitely more beautiful than the Tucan side. The waterfalls, swans, and flamingo pond are all on Quetzal side. I think the animals are mostly toward Quetzal side too. Seriously, the grounds are amazing. So, so beautiful. The beach was also beautiful. We never had a problem getting lounge chairs, no matter what time we showed up at. You can kayak for free. THe beach wasn't ever too crowded when we went. The sand is perfectly white and very clean. The water was a beautiful turquoise and everything was sandy, not rocky. If you walk about a mile away from the city you will hit undeveloped beach and it is gorgeous. We went out there a couple of times and saw tons of pelicans and crabs. We loved the food, both in the buffet and the restaurants. We don't eat meat (but do eat fish), and we always had plenty of options. Yes, the buffet does repeat its meals often but there are always so many meal options I don't understand why it's an issue. To give an idea of what we ate.. Breakfast: omelettes, fried eggs on a tortilla with refried beans, cereal, pastries, fresh fruit, all sorts of fresh juices Lunch: fish and rice, cheese sticks, nachos with cheese and guacamole, veggie sandwiches, pizza, ravioli Dinner: quesadillas, enchilladas, pasta and sauce, pizza, calamari, mussels, stuffed clams, SO much more The restaurants we went to were Mexican, Italian, and Japanese. The Japanese was the best but we really enjoyed the others too! We had a harder time finding non meat entrees at the restaurants, so if you are a full vegetarian, look at the menus first. The drinks are great and you can get them all over the resort. You can just go sit in the lobby and you will be served. Service on the beach was definitely really slow but you can just go up to the beach bar and it's quick. The entertainment is the only thing I would change about Iberostar. It's too bad because the STAR performers are excellent dancers and really wonderful performers but they are given really outdated material to work with. If they just updated their shows and kept the same staff, it would be wonderful. Still, we enjoyed the nightly entertainment. In between the kids and adult shows there is always a \"pre-show\" that involves audience members and those get pretty funny. The magic show and Mexican dancers were really, really good. Every staff member, from room service to waiters to the STAR entertainers to the concierge, aim to please and provide exceptional service. The STAR performers work 14 hour days and only get one day off a week. Still they do everything enthusiastically and truly want to make your stay enjoyable. The concierge helped us out so much, with exchange rates, calling a taxi, getting directions, and telling us how to take the collectivo. This was an absolutely amazing resort and I would recommend anyone stay at Iberostar!", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lima", "Title": "\u201cGreat family hotel\u201d", "Author": "inkalover", "ReviewID": "UR122593820", "Content": "We spent there our vacations with family and friends.

The buffet looks great, then you start eating and realize nothing is good, no matter what you try. Not even the fruit is ripe! Here we are in the tropics and they can not serve a ripe pineapple, it was hard as rock and bitter, day after day after day. There was a brand new lamb roast and I happened to be first to get a piece one night. The server cut into it, and I could see from five feet away it was completely dried out. So did he, so he cut again and served up the driest, deadest piece of stringy grey meat I've ever encountered. We started making reservations at the resort's restaurants: I'm not kidding they were equally bad if not worse because you would think they'd try harder than the buffet. I honestly think all the food comes out of the same industrial/institutional kitchen somewhere. On a positive note the hardworking, multi-functional staff (who do triple duty in various roles and work day and night, they must work 15 hour days) are nice and try hard, and the grounds and beach are lovely, and the disco was surprisingly good. However, the rooms are from The 70's Show. And they want $15/day for WiFi!! (go to Starbucks nearby).

There is obviously nonstop prep and practice that goes into their production and it shows and is very much appreciated by the nightly packed house!

We were at the resort over Christmas. It had the feeling of being in the jungle with all the amenities you need close at hand. Thatched roofs, colorful buildings and waterfalls added to the charm. Bright, clean, comfortable rooms. The bed was very firm. I thought to ask for a mattress topper but decided I managed just fine. My husband enjoyed sitting on the balcony while I preferred to stay with the air conditioning. As you move away from the beach it would get muggy. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food ranged from incredible to mediocre. Best advice for dining is to choose different things every meal and not try and taste everything. The drinks, though we are not much for drinking but we had a few. They were not that tasty to me. I found the ones with fruit juice in them were just a bit odd. I tried and loved the Mojito's! The location of our room was block 25, which was appx 1/2 way between the lobby, restaurant and the beach/ pool area. Really nothing was more than a few minutes walk away. I am a large lady with a bad foot; I found walking was easiest for me on the outer perimeter of the resort, especially at night. I found the lighting a bit dim on walkways but once used to where I was going, no problems. The inner corridor was a lush tropical delight. We saw many animals and birds. My issue was walking the inner pathway, it was rough and uneven(very hard on my foot), poorly lit for night time. But that was me. My husband and 2 daughters had no problems with it at anytime. It was wonderful to see so many families and a wide range of ages, from infants to elderly. A wide (and thin) variety of people, shapes and sizes. Try not to be self conscious, just go for it and enjoy yourself! The beach was wonderful, our girls 19 and 22 participated in a variety of activities offered. My husband and I would prefer to sit on or near the patio and look out the beach while the girls preferred to bake in the sun by the blue-green sea. The pool was fabulous. It was huge with a number of entry points. 2 gradual walk ins, 3 stairs with railings and several just stairs. There was a separate pool for water games, basketball and polo, etc, so not getting hit in the head with flying balls in the main pool. The pool was so big there was very little \"crowdedness\" happening. There was also an adults only pool with a swim up bar. We did a few excursions that were well worth it but generally liked spending time by the water. One of the best things I did was to have a massage. The nightly entertainment ranged from corny to good. The \"Mr. Iberostar\" night was a hoot with guests participating. I think most of the resorts in the very safe and clean Playa Car area looked very nice. There was a beautiful golf course a few minutes away. Many people walked into Playa Del Carmen for shopping. We took the $7 taxi ride. We would definitely go to the Quetzal, pronounced Ket-zal, again. I could bring up a few negatives but they are so minor really. The biggest drawback was the long flight, direct, for us, from B.C.

The other people on our flight who travelled with a tour operators transfer did not arrive to the hotel until 1930. For us we like to get the most time as possible out of our hotel, so we would deffinatly chose this route again, also it was a similar story on the return. On arrival to the hotel check in was very straight forward and we were taken to our room (2642) in a golf buggy. From the moment we arrived all the staff were brilliant. The hotel was immaculate and we were amazed by the amount of animals roaming the premises. When we got to the room it was a good size, very clean, I would echo what other people say about the beds, but we rang down straight away and requested a topper and this was brought up straight away. The Ala carte restaurants were excellent value, we felt the service in the Mexican was very rushed, Japanese was a bit overrated but the steakhouse was excellent. We tried some times to get cancelations in our side (Quetzal) and we were told they were fully booked and then we walked over to the desk at the tucan to try and they had availability so they must have different allocations on the restaurants. The Star Friends were fantastic, making an effort to speak to you on a daily basis and get you involved if you wanted. The evening shows were good value. We will be going back to this hotel, I could write a lot but some people need different information so if it\u2019s anything specific please get in touch.

This was the second time we had been to an iberostar hotel (first time was in Republica Dominicana). the place was really great as you could expect from Iberostart Hotels, but, i think because of we went during high season, the service was a little worse than our first experience. Please, dont misunderstand me, the people will be very helpful, but when the place is really croweded you can really see that they need more hand for helping you with things as easy as pouring osme water in your cup (in Republica, my cup was never dry). Also, we we first arrived, they took very long time to give us our room and they never gave us the welcome drinks, so i had to get them myself. The food on the other hand was terrible. I have read reviews of other people saying that it didnt had too much flavor or taste. I couldn't agree more. My biggest letdown was the available fruits. In my country, Chile, you can find fruits almost every time of the year, apparently, in Mexico, during the winter, they have very little amounts of fruits and they have no taste at all. The rest of the hotel was great. The shows were very entertaining and i really have to take my hat off to the Iberostar team. They are running all day long around the resort making your day great, and then at the end of the day they are the same ones doing the shows until very late at night. These people are amazing!

We ended up moving to the Tucan side due to issues with our room. They put us in a room with double beds and next to a very noisy part of the resort, which we were not happy with. Two beds on a honeymoon!?!? Come on!! Needless to say we were less than excited about it. We went to reception and they were amazing! They switched us with no hassle and we got our ocean view junior suite that worked out wonderfully...and honestly we liked the Tucan side better, less FIESTA all day. The Quetzal side is great if you are into all the Star Friends activities, or have kiddos. It's very loud and has lots of things going on. We however, wanted to lay on the beach and relax, which we got plenty of on the Tucan side. The food...well this is where things go south. The food was less than wonderful. It was average I would say. The breakfast was good, the omelets were very good, however the dinners were extremely disappointing, and the restaurants were not very good either. We ended up going into Playa Del Carmen and eating at some local places, which was a nice break from the buffet. The drinks are not that great either. It took me days to find one I liked, then we discovered the Mojitos, they are WONDERFUL! I drank many of them =) The beer is good, but the pina coladas are disgusting as well as the other frozen drinks. The bar in the stage area has really GOOD tequila, so if you plan on doing shooters go there and ask the bartender for his \"secret\" stash of tequila. The staff was amazing. Hands down the best service I have ever had in Mexico. They were friendly and helpful, except for one of the receptionists. His name is Mateo and he was very unfriendly and spoke to me like I was in idiot each time I approached him. I found myself waiting till he left to speak with the front desk...I will not be speaking to him if he is still working there next time we visit. The nightlife was quite fun, however lots of kiddos. If you have a family group it is a perfect place, however if you are looking for peace and quiet as we were, maybe adults only resort next time. That is where we are going in May, just to be sure...but when we have kids we will be back to the Tucan! The beach is AMAZING! So beautiful, and there are plenty of chairs and umbrellas. If you want an umbrella just go ask the guys at the towel shack, they will hook you up. A few tips: -If you are a coffee drinker ask for the cappuccinos as they are much better than the cafe con leche. -MOJITOS are the best! -Ask for a room away from the Riu hotel, the neighbor resort is super loud -Best drink options are in the hotel lobby bar and the stage bar. -Wifi is expensive, go to Starbucks in Playacar Plaza it's free and works most of the time. -Tip your maid, they work so hard Have a great stay here, we had a wonderful time.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brooklyn, New York", "Title": "\u201cVery pleased!\u201d", "Author": "Angela_M60827", "ReviewID": "UR121965651", "Content": "My husband and I had a great time.

The red flag was flying on the beach a good portion of our visit but there were still lots of people in the water.

The service was excellent, the staff spoke English and were very helpful. The food at the buffet was varied and fresh. The 4 a la carte restaurants were very very good.

If you like rack of lamb order it at the Italian as it was done to perfection, as were the steaks (rib eye, and kabobs) at the Steakhouse, the Mexican had interesting appetizers as well as the main meal and we thoroughly enjoyed them all. The Japanese was good too and they put on a show flinging the knives in the air. Order a \"superman\" drink there as they are really good - not too many or someone will have to carry you out! The beach was beautiful with white sand and you could walk for a long distance as there were no rocks or sharp objects. The pools were great as well with lots of activities and a quiet pool, a pool where they taught diving, and a swim up bar pool, as well as the main large pool. There was horseshoes etc on the beach and every night there was really great entertainment in the theatre free. The costumes were lovely - those dancers work really hard. We met a very sweet girl from New Zealand - Heather - and spent some time visiting with her - also a couple of the young men, Allan and Paul. Everyone was so friendly and interesting. I'd recommend getting your massages on 5th Avenue at Habi with either Carmen or Yuanita - they are awesome and it is only $40 US for 60 minute massage. The massage spa at the hotel is very very expensive so I would stay away from that. However, the jaccuzzi hot and cold pools are free and very nice with lockers. The rooms were great - we asked for \"foamies\" when we checked in as beds in Mexico tend to be really hard. They were brought to our room and put on our beds immediately which made our beds very comfortable. There is no bathtub but a full marble slate shower with lots of hot water. If the fan in your bathroom doesn't work, call the desk right away as they will fix it and it avoids you having a steamed up bathroom all the time. There is a large safe in the closet with a digital lock which is free and easy to use. Also you get a towel card which you must turn in at the desk upon checkout or else pay for the beachtowel. I loved everything about the Iberostar Quetzal - Tucan. We were on the Quetzal side of the hotel - it is like two sides but one large hotel. We preferred the Quetzal side feel with the waterfalls and jungle trees and it had a plank boardwalk to the buffet whereas the other side had more marble - which does make it easier for walking. A word to women - wear flats as your shoes can get caught in the holes between the boards. Also all the pathways are sort of rocky so good walking shoes (I wore my birkenstalks) are needed.

My review will be accepted by those who want to hear open and honest feedback or will be rejected by those who want to believe what they want to believe. The intent here is not to bash anyone or any hotel. My review will be broken up into several categories, rated accordingly on a 1 \u2013 5 scale (1 = poor and 5 = outstanding) and a tip if I have one. It is your right to agree or disagree however, please keep in mind that my opinion is there to help you decide on a destination. My 25 years of travel experience are mostly in the Caribbean and other warm tropical places. If you are in a hurry, you can skip down to the Summary for my review. AIRPORT (Rating = 3) The arrival into Cancun International airport was typical of any foreign destination. Our flight was uneventful and on time. Customs at the airport was quick. Once you have your luggage, you will be asked to press a button on a \u201cstop light\u201d mechanism. If you get the green light, you can proceed. If you get a red light, you have your luggage searched. (TIP: I think the trick is to get behind someone who just got a red light. The theory is that they will not have 2 reds in a row which would cause a traffic jam at the inspection table. Supposedly, this is random.) Once you have cleared customs, you will be greeted by your newly found friends that try and usher you towards time share opportunities. Keep walking until you see you shuttle rep, unless you are interested in buying a time share. CHECK IN (Rating = 4) Check in at the hotel was smooth. While you are checking in, you are greeted with a punch drink which was very refreshing after a 45 minute ride from the airport. The bell men do a great job explaining the grounds and use a golf cart to bring your luggage to your room. Warning: there are no elevators in these three story accommodations. This will count as your daily exercise if you have a second or third floor room. ROOM (Rating = 3) Our party consisted of 2 adults and 2 children. Our room had 2 double beds (there is an option with one king bed). Our building was in the 2100 block which had a partial view of the beach and faced the adjacent resort. It was very convenient to the pool, dive shop and beach. (TIP: The 2000 block are true ocean front views) The rooms were very clean and service was great. The beds on the other hand were rock hard and extremely uncomfortable. This was a common complaint with other guests. The room did have a safe, stocked fridge and small sofa. (TIP: If you need a softer bed, try the sofa seat. We switched off every night as to who would sleep on it). GROUNDS (Rating = 5) The grounds of the resort makes this property very unique. As soon as you walk past the reception area, you enter a jungle-like atmosphere with wildlife all around. The restaurants are lined with waterfalls and streams which are filled with turtles and koi fish. The grounds are kept pristine and you will be welcomed by a variety of animals such as peacocks, turtles, roosters, flamingos, lizards, monkeys and an animal we could not identify. The stone paths to the rooms wind through the jungle and are shared with the wandering peacocks, monkeys (in the trees above) and the unidentified creatures mentioned above. Entrances to a couple of restaurants were by bridges over waterfalls inhabited by swans and other ducks. Bottom line\u2026 atmosphere is tropical and you feel you are in a jungle. FOOD & DRINKS (Rating = 2) This is where the resort falls short and does not live up to the Iberostar quality I have experienced. The food was bland and not fresh. There are several specialty restaurants \u2013 Japanese, steak house, Italian, Mexican and the buffet. Out of all the restaurants, the Japanese restaurant was good based on food quality and service compared to the others. The buffet was predictable and after the 3rd day I was disappointed with the food and quality. Literally, there was no taste to the food no matter what it was (fish, steak, chicken, etc.) Please understand that I am not a food critic and did not expect a 5 star food selection, however, the resort should try to make an effort to change the menu every once in awhile. (In reading the reviews for the food for this resort, I am amazed at how people think this was great. I am glad they enjoyed it and I will leave it at that.) The drinks are not top shelf and are brands that are weak in spirit. Our popular drink was a \u201cdirty monkey\u201d and several kids liked the \u201cfantasy\u201d Stick with the beer, it\u2019s consistent. BEACH & POOL AREAS (Rating = 4) The beach was beautiful and the sand was soft. The interesting part is that the sand always felt cool even during the peak sun hours. The beach is also lined with these big sand bags to help with the shore from not being washed away. During our stay, the waves were larger than normal and the lifeguards had raised the red flag meaning \u201cstay out of the water\u201d. It was interesting to see how several people did not follow the warnings and proceeded to swim in these conditions. The pools were kept in great condition and plenty of lounge chairs to go around. From the zero depth pool entrances to the water polo square pool, the workers were constantly making sure \u201cthings\u201d were picked up. \u2026\u2026WARNING\u2026The towel game is played at this resort. From what I saw when getting my morning coffee, there were towels out by 5:30am. There are some spots by the pool that have hut styles for lounge chairs. These are elevated double wide chairs covered by a thatch roof. They look comfortable and were \u201ctowel-reserved\u201d very early. I saw one family use the life preservers from the pool to reserve one of these huts. After he arrived to claim his spot, he put the life preserver on the ground next to the bushes and never put it back to where it was hanging. Some spots along the pool had easy access to the bars and restaurants. Other spots required a short walk to the venue of your choice. The adult pool was secluded and was never busy. I think that it may be due to the fact that it was not near the popular sections of the pool. ACTIVITIES (Rating = 2) There was plenty to do if you looked for it. Typical excursions were offered (scuba, snorkeling, etc) and a wide variety of resort activities such as archery, bocce ball, volleyball, etc. were offered everyday. The STAR players made a good effort to get everyone involved in the resort activities. They work very hard to provide these activities for the guests and I was amazed at how they were not tired by the end of the night. ENTERTAINMENT (Rating = 3) The nightly shows consisted of an 8PM kids show and a 9:30PM show. The kids show was directed by the STAR players who manage the kids club called Lucy\u2019s club. The two STAR players from Lucy\u2019s club were Michelle and Mariscella who provided the daily activities for the kids in the club. They were awesome and did an outstanding job with the kids. The 9:30PM shows were a hit or miss. There were some talented dancers and singers but don\u2019t expect a professional show. You have to understand that these STAR players are there all day and then have to put on a show for the guests on top of their other daily tasks. I give them tons of credit for working long hours. There are some bits of info which must be mentioned so I will add this to the STAR players section below. My expectation was low and I was neither surprised nor disappointed except for several instances which I will mention below in the STAR PLAYERS review. STAR PLAYERS (Rating = 2) Almost every all-inclusive resort has a group assigned to get the guests involved. Iberostar has the STAR players. As I mentioned above, there are some talented players and hard working STAR players that watch over the young ones. It\u2019s unfortunate that the one negative that was mentioned by everyone I spoke with at pool side or at dinner is that the attitudes of the main STAR Players were egotistical and pompous. I will not mention any names, however, the feeling that everyone got was that they would ignore you if you did not fit their \u201cclick\u201d. This was very disappointing and disgusted several patrons. The evening shows consisted of these STAR players selecting the same people for their audience participation versus going out into the crowd and engaging others besides the \u201cbeer-drinking buddies\u201d or \u201cafter hours buddies\u201d. The other event that was inappropriate was the fact the 9:30PM shows would surprise you with acts that were not suited for a younger crowd. There were no warnings about the show having sexual or adult themes and the show started right after the kids show. SO of course the kids are going to stick around. There are a number of people that were going to complain to Iberostar about the stripper on stage who decided to do his routine and show his butt and make sexual gestures with his genitalia to the audience. When several parents told the emcee, he just smiled and continued on showing know respect for the families with kids. At least warn the parents in someway so that they can decide whether to stay or not. Basically, these specific STAR players require you to adore them or you will be ignored. TOWN. (Rating = 2) The town of Playa Del Carmen is located about a 5 minute ride. The town is full of tourist shops where the vendors are trying to persuade you to buy from them. Although it looked like there were some infrastructure improvements going on, it looked like a hurricane just swept through it leaving the stores patched up with any kind of material they can find. The pharmacy on 5th avenue is a must. It has all your souvenirs and all the regulated drugs you can buy over the counter without a prescription. SUMMARY In traveling to other Iberostar resorts, we were disappointed in the Quetzal. It did have a nice layout and you did feel you were in a tropical environment with a great selection of pools and beaches. The Tucan is a mirror image of the Quetzal. We could not tell the difference. The food is below average for an Iberostar family of resorts. If you haven\u2019t been to other all inclusives and this is your first one, then I can guarantee that you can experience better food at other resorts. The STAR players made this trip a little uncomfortable and frustrating as mentioned above and I feel sorry for the few STAR players that really worked hard (Salvatore, Marisella, Michelle, Gaella and towel guy ) The other STAR players who thought it was all about them and their egos should consider an alternative job.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rogue River, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cLove Our Yearly Mexico Vaction\u201d", "Author": "vettemaninoregon", "ReviewID": "UR120803911", "Content": "Arrived 31st of October for our 3rd Mexico vacation in the Playa del Carmen area in as many years. This was our first stay at the Iberostar Quetzal, 6 nights and then move to the Iberostar Cozumel for 4 days on 6th of November. I will not go into great detail about our stay but I will mention some information that is lacking in most reviews. I will say that Iberostar gives you a great experience for the money spent we paid less than $190 per night,via Vacations to Go. I do agree with most of the Excellent and Very Good reviews written in Trip Advisor. The hotel property is comprised of two complexes the Tucan and Quetzal, the 3 story buildings either face the jungle/pool area in the center of the resort or the property next door which is another hotel complex. The two properties share some common areas such as the pool area and entertainment theater. Building closest to the ocean and facing the jungle/pool area would be preferred by most folks as it is away from the entertainment theater which is kind of loud until about 11pm of course you normally stay up late and attend the entertainment that will be no problem. We request a room near the pool and facing the inside of the resort and the 3rd floor which is near the top of the canopy of the jungle, we were really happy with the room. When occupancy rate is low only one buffet will be used by both properties, the best ala carte restaurant is the Japanese because of the entertainment of watching your meal prepared at your group table. Yes, reviews are correct the beach is very nice and if you go to the left and walk about 2 miles you end up in Playa del Carmen the entire walk is nice clean sand and resort after resort, very safe walk as all the resorts have security people about the beach. If you turn right you can walk at least 1 mile of beach that is undeveloped with plenty of other tourist walking the natural shoreline. Not much area for snorkeling but of the area is good for swimming with buoy marking the safe area to swim, many of the resorts on the beach have life guards on duty. All the hotels in this area are with in a security zone which extends from just north of Playa del Carmen to just pasted the Iberostar complex. This security zone includes hotel resorts, private residents, time shares, golf courses, etc. Almost forgot, best drinks at the lobby bars the other bars are hit and miss. A few other points; bring a flashlight, don\u2019t feed the monkeys, tip for good service and do relax.

Since coming home I have had 2 emails from the iberostar. It didn't matter as the front desk staff went out of their way to accommodate us after our first night, we got our ground floor room down near the pool, great location, and great room. Our room was clean, bright, everything worked and we even had a Peacock early one morning sitting on our balcony, however, the rooms should have golf umbrellas just incase you have a surprise HURRICANE hee hee. We actually enjoyed the firm beds. Maid service was excellent. Resort is well maintained. Lots of fun walking through the jungle and seeing all the wild animals. (Wild meaning very tame especially if you have food) Al a cartes - Japanese - great and lots of fun, Steak house - Rib-eye steak is very good. Since we had a little extra rain (hurricane) they closed the restaurants down, so it threw the reservations out of wack. We were still happly with what we got. The buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner were very good. Variety was good, and breakfast with Mimosa's started our days. Staff - everywhere were great, friendly, helpfull, willing to please. Nightly entertainment - Enjoyable Lobby Bar - Nice place to relax with a cappacino and talk to new friends. Disco - Fun place but not for all, very loud Playa del Carmen - Good to see 5th Ave. and sit and have a light lunch and a Corona. A real must see is - COCO BONGO'S - Get the Tuesday night special a little cheaper, and see your friendly towel guy for details - ITS A BLAST !!!! Check Out - Was easy and no surprises.

We usually don't stay at the same city or accommodation, but we had no doubts about booking this again. Whichever side (Quetzal or Tucan) you choose, it does not matter as it really is the same resort. Seen from the beach, Tucan is the half of the resort on the left (south), Quetzal the one on the right (north). October is low season, and the main buffet was only open on the Quetzal side this year (the other way around last year), but as both are 1 minute apart, that shouldn't really influence your choice I'd say. Have been to Iberostar Bavaro in the Dominican Republic before, so can compare here. Room: Spacious (seating area not as big as in the DR) and comfortable, with small balcony. We stayed in a room in block 22 (blocks run from 20 on the beach to 29 near the reception, Tucan has similar numbering from 10 to 19). I.e. close to pool, pool-side restaurant, and beach. Room was thoroughly cleaned every day. With 2 kids under 3, I'd recommend booking a room with king size bed on a ground floor. And ask for 2 wooden baby cots (2 sizes available :-)) to be put next to it when you arrive. If you put the lazy chair and table on your terrace, this leaves plenty of space inside. Food & Drinks: Good quality food and drinks (I liked the fruit and vegetables a little better in the DR), and friendly service. Of the restaurants besides the buffet (Italian, Mexican, Japanese, and Steak House), we favored the Italian. Steak House is also good, recommend the Tenderloin. Japanese is fun to sit around the table with other guests, but the food quality is inferior. Mexican was a let down last year after having eaten 'real' Mexican inland, so we didn;t even try to go there this year. Grounds: Beautiful (better than DR) and spacious, with a jungle full of animals (great for our elder daughter) to walk through on your way to the bigger of the 2 breakfast buffet areas. Agoutis, Monkeys, Tucans, Peacocks, Flamingos, Chickens, Lizzards, Turtles, and many more animals were present. There is a separate childrens pool, and right next to it a slide, climb rack and the usual playground apparatus in the sand for the little ones: ideal! Location: This hotel is located just 5 minutes and now 70 pesos (roughly usd 5 or eur 4) by taxi to or from Playa del Carmen 5th Avenue. Good for shopping, a massage, or diving (significant cost difference with those services at or around the hotel), and the ferry to Cozumel (140 pesos one way, 30 minutes by boat last year). About 5 minutes walk towards Playa del Carmen from the hotel you can find a Starbucks with free internet. (fyi - In case you're considering different Iberostars - the Iberostar Paraiso Maya is located away from everything between Cancun and Playa del Carmen). Other: Thrifty has on-site car rental available next to the Quetzal reception, and it's easy to rent a car and visit the city of Valladolid (~2 hrs) and Chichen Itza (done last year) or Ek Balam (this year) (both roughly 45 mins further) together in a day. Pre-arranged and organized excursions are bookable on-site as well if you like. Hotel also has tennis courts, shooting/archery range, a fitness center, a spa, and a night club, though I didn't make use of them.

In many ways this is the best. However in some ways the Iberostar Costa Dorada is better. Location The hotel is last but one on the Playacar beach and about a 45 minute walk from 5th Avenue (shopping centre of Playa Del Carmen). However a small shopping centre is a 5 minute walk away. If you are a beach lover, there can be few better than this. The area outside the hotel is very safe for tourists and surrounded by many luxury villas. Staff Without question the best group of people I have ever encountered. It would be wrong of me to highlight any individual because the maid kept our room immaculate, the restaurant and bar staff were great, the animation team were outstanding and reception staff extremely helpful and polite. Restaurants/Bars The buffet did not have the same quality and variety as the Costa Dorada but the alacarte restaurants were all first class. No bar or restaurant has air conditioning and on a hot murky afternoon/evening they were not as comfortable as I would have liked. Remeber if you want a branded drink you must ask for it by name or you will automatically receive a local one. Room Probably the biggest disappointment. I thought it was not to the standard as the caribbean hotels I have visited. Although the maid made up for this as she kept it absolutely pristine. Pool area The pool was large and mostly warm but the area was probably the least attractive as the beds were left out overnight and the area was not the cleanest. This may seem unfair as staff were always about cleaning but this appeared mostly ineffective with bird droppings etc, regularly found on the beds. The 'Jungle' You will hear many reviews speak about the jungle and the animals. There are so many different creatures running around I have to say that sometimes I felt we were living in a zoo! It wasn't really for me but many people I spoke to found it amazing. It is certainly different to come out of a pool and walk into an inguana! If you have children who like animals and wish to see different ones this may be the place for you. Overall This is a very good and well run hotel. Very good value for money and well worth a visit. However we like to keep in touch with family at home while away but found the WIFI price at the hotel too expensive. We walked the short distance each day to Starbucks for a frapachinno and obtained the wifi free. I do have copies of the drinks lists and hotel information/hotel layout if anyone wishes.

They are essential 2 hotels that share all the same common grounds. The Quetzal is more \"wooden\" where as the Tucan is more \"marble\". I also believe Funjet books the Quetzal and Apple books the Tucan. Rooms -- Not overly large or special, but just perfect. They were cleaned promptly daily, and although they claim to stock the soda & beer every 2 days, the maid will do it whenever asked. The beds are hard as reported, but I like them hard. We did ask for a foam topper as the wife was slightly uncomfortable, and this was provided right away. Grounds -- Absolutly what makes this resort beautiful. They are well maintained and very clean. There is a jungle between the two hotels that is absolutly amazing. You see peacocks, agouti's, and monkeys just wandering the grounds daily. Pool -- Large and well maintained. Different depths throughout. The towel game is played, but never had any issues. The swim-up bar is down a number of stairs.....never too crowded, and has the best bartender in the resort -- Samuel. Food -- redundant at the buffet, but a wide selection, so everyone should be able to find something. I ate at the Steakhouse, Japanese, and Italian. My favorite was the Japanese. Good show and good food. Drinks -- as strong as you ask them to make them. Only problem is the only bar that has the \"good stuff\" is in the lobby. All other bars serve only \"bar\" brand. Lots of people visit the lobby bar before or after dinner. Check-in/Check-out -- Check-in was an issue. We had 2 rooms that were supposed to be in the same building.....we wound up 4 buildings apart. Staff definitely had an attitude and was not very accomidating. Check-out was a snap....basically they appeared to not even care. Just took the pool cards and room keys and sent you on your way. Staff - other than the front desk was some of the best hardest working i have found. These people work long days, and go out of their way to make your stay as good as possible. I however found myself feeling bad for them as the crowd the week I stayed 9/16 - 9/24 was quite possibly the cheapest i have seen at an AI. NOBODY was leaving tips for these people. These are probably the same people that wil complain they couldn't get their drinks fast enough around the pool. Come on people....I know it is an AI, but open up your pockets. A few $'s go a long way. Think about that meal you ate.....what would it have cost at home?? Over all.....this is an excellent family oriented resort located about 60 minutes from Cancun airport.

This hotel has many returning customers which speaks for its self ( one couple from the USA told us it was their 11th time !). The 'jungle' area in the central area of the complex is fantastic and the wildlife ( Monkeys, Agouti and Iguanas) were a highlight - try lying in bed watching monkeys playing in the trees outside your room ? We would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. A few tips - book your trips directly with the hotel as you get customised transport and dont have to endure endless pick ups from lots of other hotels. You can book your restaurants all in one go if you want to, and although they state only five restaurant bookings for a 14 day visit, when the hotel is not so busy you can actually go as often as you like. A small tip to the bar and buffet staff will ensure really attentive service and they really appreciate it. Try to talk a little Spanish to the staff - it goes a long way with them. The man in the water sports booking area will blow up your inflatables for you with compressor ! Dont feed the monkeys - they will chase you when you run out of food !", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHeaven on Earth....\u201d", "Author": "MrsD9922", "ReviewID": "UR118405375", "Content": "This hotel is heaven on earth, my husband and I stayed here all inclusive for 12 days and I have three pathetic things to moan about, infact hardly seems worth it but here goes. 1) Mosquito's DO take plenty of repellent and try not to leave your patio door open to your room, we made this mistake once and paid the price all night for it, we asked someone to come and fumigate our room for us which they did within 10 minutes of asking, solved the problem immediately. 2) The hotel staff do not really enforce rules - no kids in pool bar - there were a few kids but after lots of evil glares from adults attempting to get peacefully drunk, the kids were removed by their parents. The lunchtime buffet restaurant has a no swimwear policy, yet there were many unsightly bellies, bottoms and boobies poking out as we attempted to eat lunch. I wouldn't mind so much if the restaurant staff didn't pick and choose who they asked to cover up, a slim lady walked in, in just a Bikini and she was asked to put something on over the top. A lot of men in speedo's and other ladies walking around in just Bikini's, baffled as to why the other lady was asked to cover up. 3) The maids are pretty noisy in the mornings, the accomdation blocks are quite echoey and if you like a lie in, you might have to go and have a word with the maid in charge of your block. But that's it, they are the bad points, now onto the Good! The hotel grounds are beautiful, you feel like you're living in a jungle / rainforest. Lots of animals just waltzing about the place, Peacocks (and many other birds) Monkey's, Flamingo's, Lizards, Agouti's (Large Guinea Pigs we took to calling them). Not a Spider insight although I'm pretty sure there were some about - there usually are.... We were in a standard room but it was nice, big and clean. Comfortable bed and Large shower cubicle. Restaurants - The main Buffet Restaurant had an amazing breakfast selection, although very catered to american tastes. Dinner supplied a good selection but we found it a bit samey after a few days, same can be said for the lunchtime Buffet restaurant. The hotel also has 4 speciality restaurants, Japanese, Italian, Mexican and a Steak house. In our opinion, the Japanese serves by far the best food and no not all sushi. The Italian was very nice indeed, with the best service of all the restaurants. yummy desserts too, the Mexican and the steak house were less impressive but I guess it all depends on personal tastes. The Pool is nice and large, although be warned, the steps going in are unusual in the sense that the last step is really tall, you step off and there appears to be no bottom. If you are under 5ft you may struggle with this, so just jump straight in! The Beach is just beautiful, at both the pool and the beach we felt perfectly safe leaving our bag by our sunbeds, with camera's, room key, books etc. we had no troubles at all leaving our belongings and floating around for an hour and everything was still intact. You do get a few people on the beach trying to sell things to you but not too many and if you do just say No thank you they carry on walking, they were no hassle at all. For the most part the sea was beautifully clear and calm but a couple of mornings there was seaweed everywhere on the beach and in the water after everything being churned up from overnight storms. Impressively there are guys that work the resorts and clean all the seaweed up so not an issue there. The hotel has a night club - Mascara it's cheesy but great fun if you don't want to go too far for a night out. The Star Friends entertainers - Usually I steer clear of hotel entertainment, experience tells me it's pretty bad. That is not the case here, the star friends team work amazingly hard, they are all super friendly and the evening entertainment is well worth watching. They put in an incredible amount of effort, and the shows are just too good to be true for hotel entertainment. The Spa - We didn't visit the Spa as such but we did have a massage in their beach hut listening to the ocean....perfect way to start the holiday!! A few other pointers - if you are coming from the UK or Europe, take Mexican Peso's as your currency rather than USD's. You'll get a better rate for your money. You have to pay a departure tax at the airport of GBP \u00a340 or 700 Peso's per person, again do not take USD's for this. The Mexican Government are trying to use their own currency more rather than USD's. The resort is perfectly safe, Playa Del Carmen is a massive complex but has security check points to get in and out and the same at each hotel. About a 7 minute walk from the hotel are some shops, cafe's, chemists, touristy bits and bobs. If you need anything it's worth the walk here rather than the hotel shop which is seriously over priced. At the front of the hotel, turn right and keep walking, the shops are on the left side of the road, you can't miss them! We didn't take Kids, but there is a kids club which looked pretty good, and very active for the little ones. Excursions were fairly expensive but they really were worth it. We had 2 issues where we needed to call someone to our room, the first was the mosquito issue as mentioned above, and the second was that we somehow managed to break the flusher on our toilet. In the time it took us to go and report it to the Guest Services Desk, go to the hotel shop and walk back to our room, the maintenance man had been in and fixed it. Incredibly fast service!! Not really sure what else to tell you, we loved it here and would go back again and again. The Staff are friendly, and always ready to help. The hotel is in a beautiful setting and clean, the pool and beach are lots of fun and very safe. If you want to know anything else which I've not covered, please get in touch!!", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio, TX", "Title": "\u201cA place like no other\u201d", "Author": "CaptainClaud", "ReviewID": "UR118159098", "Content": "Don\u2019t worry; about the reports of violence you hear in Mexico, this area in Playa del Carmen is very safe. All that drama with the violence is happening in northern Mexico. Like one of the local told us, if you don\u2019t go looking for trouble it won\u2019t find you. The hotel area in Playa Car is gated; the guards ask the shuttle drivers and taxi drivers for their identification cards to make sure they are suppose to be in the area. My husband and I felt safe walking around outside of the resort. This hotel has its own beach access. We noticed when we went walking outside of our resort that some of the Riu hotels nearby do not have beach access, and their guest had to cross the street to go to the beach at the Riu Place, which seemed like a pain for them. My husband and I stayed on the Iberostar Quetzal side. There are two sides to this resort, Quetzal and Tucan, not too sure, why they don\u2019t consider it just one resort because you share everything, the pool, and restaurants. However, this hotel is not huge, you don\u2019t need a golf cart or shuttle to move you around and everything is walking distance. The resort itself is like no other place. There are so many animals: tortoise, monkeys in the trees, flamingos, peacocks, and these little groundhog/rodent looking things that are called agouti, they are everywhere. To find the monkeys walk through the jungle area, they are usually behind the kids club behind the children\u2019s playground near the pool. If you happened to get a room on the 3rd floor, I wouldn\u2019t leave your swimsuit on the balcony to dry, we heard complaints of the monkeys making off with bikinis, but we thought that was funny. The staff is wonderful, they are very attentive, and the \u201cStar Friends\u201d the people who put on the shows every night enjoy what they do and it shows. They work hard every night to put on great variety show and they help get the audience in the mood to participate. If you arrive to the theater early, a \u201cstar friend\u201d will be sure to ask you to come up on stage and participate in whatever their activity for the night will be. They are usually fun trivia games before each show. Just a word to the wise, the theater is open air, there are ceilings fans but it does get humid because of the tropical area, I took a small hand held fan with me to help keep cool. The adult pool bar is secluded for a good reason it\u2019s a cool area (temp wise) with a lot of shade, and is very relaxing if you want to get a away from the children and the music at the main pool. This is a great place to meet other couples/new friends. We met some great people from England and we pretty much hung out with them our entire vacation. Kenny, Carole, Lewis, Vicky, Steve, and Laura, drop us a line if you happen to read this! The al la carte restaurants are great, the Japanese restaurant was fun; some of the restaurants are air conditioned, which is very nice on the humid nights. My husband and I also tried the Italian restaurant, I had the spaghetti, which I really did not care for, but my husband had the Lamb Chops, which were delicious. These restaurants book up quickly so I recommend making your dinner reservations for the al la carte restaurants the day you arrive. The buffet was ok, nothing too exciting or different from any other buffets I have tried. We also heard from other guest that the Steak house was wonderful; they recommended we try the ribs but we didn\u2019t have a chance to try the steak house because our trip was so short 5nights, 6 days goes by so quickly when you\u2019re having fun, but there\u2019s always next time. Also for the parents, the hotel has a Kids Club, kind of like a baby sitter to watch the kids while their parents enjoy some time alone during the day. Not too sure if they charge for this service but I\u2019m sure, it\u2019s worth it to get a relaxing day off. The nightclub Mascara was great, why leave the hotel and pay for a taxi, and extra at clubs in the city when you have music, drinks included, the club is air conditioned so it\u2019s a great night to spend an evening with friends. The not so good The bed was extremely firm, a guest at the pool recommended we call the front desk and ask for an \u201cegg crate\u201d or \u201cfoam mattress\u201d. We did as soon as we got back to the room, and boy did it help; housekeeping came quickly to put it on the mattress. Beware of slippery floors, the hotel tries its best to put up signs and mats to wipe your feet but the floors right outside of the hotel rooms are marble and very slippery when wet. My husband and I witnessed a few people slip and fall because they were walking too fast and didn\u2019t see a puddle of water after it rained overnight. Other stuff, We did an all day excursion at Xel-Ha, bus picked us up early at 7am, we arrived at the park by 9 when it opened and stayed there all day until 5 pm. The park is all-inclusive, all you can drink and eat all day. It\u2019s a very clean park, take some biodegradable sun block, the park is trying to preserve the sea life and the chemicals in non-biodegradable sun block damage the reef. Try buying it at home or away from the park, you will spend like 30 dollars US for a small bottle of this sun block at the park. Also bring your own waterproof cameras there are a lot of fish to see underwater and if you buy one at the park, you can spend another 20-30 dollars for one. There is so much to do zip line, snorkel, toob, relax on a hammock, or on their chairs by the water, all is included, you can also pay extra to swim with dolphins, feed manatees or swim and feed stingrays. Overall, we would return to this resort, as many other guest have, we met a lot of people who return to this exact resort once or twice a year, it\u2019s a wonderful place for honeymooners, people on anniversary, families.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Zoetermeer", "Title": "\u201cFantastic beautiful and clean hotel\u201d", "Author": "AnjaGout", "ReviewID": "UR118071353", "Content": "In may 2011 my husband and I went back to this hotel.

We cannot fault the stay - staff, accomodation, food, service, entertainment (daytime and evening). It all exceeded our expectations. The hotel in informal set in semi-jungle surroundings and is very open plan so if you don't like animal life and all that entails (noises at all times of day but not all day, the occasional food thieves but not irritatingly so and visitors to your balacony that sometimes make you jump but also make you laugh) this may not be the place for you. BUT WE LOVED IT and have many great photos. The staff were so helpful, friendly and good fun and do not expect tips (although they deserve them). Loads for active teenage lads to do and occasionally for their less active parents to join in with! We would definitely recommend and plan to return there again. Take Pesos not Dollars - although many deal in Dollars they all deal in Pesos and the hotel will not change Dollar travellers cheques and it is a pain to do into Playa del Carmen for the bank. Word of warning about Playa del Carmen - 5th Avenue sellers are a pain pestering for business and use many con tactics to get you into their shops. You need to be very strong and ignore which becomes quite waring and intimidating (and I'm a tough cookie!). Barter for best prices as they do try it on though. Don't try walking into Playa as it's about 40 mins along the road in searing heat with no breeze or 55 min along beach with slight breeeze but hard to walk through sand with no shade. Use taxi - only 70 Pesos.Lots of great trips out - recommend Explor (brilliant and I'm scared of heights), diving off reefs (with turtles if you are lucky like we were) and day quad bike jungle trek (take mosquito repellent and cover yourslf in it). Did whale shark day trip which was fantastic but long day in searing heat and felt that a third of it was 'fill-in' time which could have been left out and made it chaeper - it is very expensive but the actual dive with the whale sharks is spectacular.

This is our second visit to Mexico, but first time staying in Playacar. Flight We travelled from London Gatwick with Thomas Cook and check-in was fast and easy! We paid extra and booked exit seats for extra legroom, as premium is no longer available. We thought the exit seats were well worth the money, as the standard economy seating seemed more cramped than on a Thompson plane. The meals on the plane were just ok; however, the flight attendants were very friendly and attentive. When arriving in Cancun airport make sure that you have fully filled out BOTH sides of the immigration form to speed up queues. If you haven\u2019t already been to Cancun airport before, it\u2019s bedlam! Despite this, we were still able to get off the plane, go through customs, collect our suitcases and board the transfer coach in 1 hour! The transfer from Cancun airport to the hotel is roughly 45 minutes \u2013 1 hour and we had 2 or 3 drop offs before we arrived at the Quetzal. Check In On arrival to the hotel, we were greeted with a cool welcome drink \u2013 much needed in the blazing hot sun! Check in was very speedy; however, we had to fill in a form that requires your passport numbers, so keep your passports to hand. After checking in and receiving our all-inclusive wristbands, towel and key cards, we were pointed in the direction of our rooms, but as the hotel is located in a jungle, it can be quite difficult to find your way around in the first few days. Here\u2019s a link of the entire complex that may come in useful: http://www.iberostar-board.com/Tucan_Map.pdf. After finding our rooms, within 10 minutes our luggage was delivered by one of the bellboys. The Room We requested to stay in block 23 by email, 2 weeks prior to our departure. We were lucky enough to be granted our requests and stayed in rooms 2311 and 2312, which were located on the ground floor. Block 23 and is about a 2 minute walk to the beach and right next to the pool. It took about 3-4 minutes to walk to the lobby, so we were pleased with block 23. The rooms were comfortable and the beds were not as hard as most make out to be! The rooms were very clean and our maid, Veronica, did a brilliant job each day making towel animals and the general upkeep of the room. The bathroom was quite small, but had a large walk-in shower. The fridge was restocked every other day with bottles of water, cans of fizz, such as Diet Coke, Fanta and Sprite, as well as beer. Our rooms had a large flat screen cable TV with various channels with plenty of English speaking channels \u2013 but with the beautiful weather and surroundings, there\u2019s not much time to be watching it! The email for guest services which we used to request our rooms and birthday cake (see A La Carte bookings) is: <rrpptucque@iberostar.com.mx Food Before our holiday, we read various reviews that complained about the food, but we thought people were just being fussy, but if we have to be completely honest, we didn\u2019t think the food was that great at the buffet restaurants and we are not fussy eaters at all! After 3 days, we were queuing each day to try and reserve extra a la carte\u2019s! (Guest services is open from 10 am \u2013 12 pm and then again from 4 pm \u2013 8 pm). - Breakfast \u2013 offers the usual, i.e. toast, cereals, fruit, omelettes, bacon, sausages, eggs, waffles, pancakes, doughnuts etc\u2026 - Lunch - probably had the best selection of food; however, we mostly visited the beach snack bars for lunch. The main snack bar (also the Tropical restaurant) is located by the beach and also serves breakfast from 10 am onwards. The quieter snack bar is located next to the pool (also the Steak restaurant) and few people know about this, so is perfect if you want a quieter meal! Food included chips, burgers, hot dogs, rice, pizza, pasta, paella, grilled chicken beef and fish etc. - Dinner \u2013 we disliked the most and found was quite repetitive, but the quesadillas are very tasty!! Mostly offered the same as lunch, but also different meats and fish at the carving stations. A la Carte As we stayed at the hotel for 2 weeks, we were given 5 reservations at the speciality restaurants and we managed to get bookings for each of them. The food in these restaurants were brilliant and we enjoyed all of them! The service was excellent! The Mexican, Italian and Japanese are all air-conditioned (however, the Japanese still gets hot!), whilst the Steak and Tropical were not, as they are located by the pool and beach and are also used during the day for breakfast and lunch. We booked the steak restaurant in advance as we were celebrating my daughter\u2019s birthday. We booked the cake and the restaurant prior to our stay. The cake was 410 pesos and was for 10 people (!). Beach/Pool The beach was absolutely beautiful with white sands and clear blue sea!! There are plenty of sun loungers, but not so many palapas (straw huts). As most of the palapas are already reserved by 7:30 am, you can ask for portable umbrellas from the towel hut. We were able to get loungers and umbrellas on the first day at around midday. We didn\u2019t spend much time by the pool, but visited the adult swim up bar a few times! Whilst it is quite a noisy area, it is great for meeting people! In total, there are 4 pools. The Entertainment The animation team (Star Friends) work extremely hard during the day and at night to keep everyone entertained! Whilst they encourage people to get involved they do not force you to do anything. We watched the show a few times, which were ok and are set on a 2 week basis so you\u2019ll see a different show each night. Tips Whilst staying at the Quetzal, we did not experience any problems regarding tips. No member of staff actually look for tips or puts you under pressure to tip them. We found that the service was good everywhere even without tips! The staff are always happy and willing to help. We left our room maid $2 every couple of days. Trips/outings - Playa Del Carmen The cab fare into Playa Del Carmen in 70 pesos or $7 regardless of how many people are travelling or the time of day. We visited Playa Del Carmen once during the day and a couple of times during the evening. Whilst it is nice to see the town during the day, it is extremely hot walking around! Playa Del Carmen is perfectly safe and is a pedestrianized area. Starbucks is fully air-conditioned and has free Wi-Fi, with the code printed on your till receipt. The Wi-Fi at the hotel is pricey. - Playacar Come out of the Quetzal turn right and walk five minutes up the road. There is the same sort of souvenirs and items at Playacar as there is in Playa Del Carmen. There is also a Starbucks here with free Wi-Fi. - Senor Frogs We visited Senor Frogs twice; once for dinner and again for a drink at the bar. Senor Frogs has a very good atmosphere and the food is brilliant! The staff are very friendly and fun and the food and drink is fine to consume! It is a great evening out and well worth a visit! - Coco Bongo We booked with Edgar and Robin on the beach/by the pool who were great and very helpful! Edgar and Robin actually work at Coco Bongo and so it is completely safe to book with them. We went on a Thursday night as we heard that it can be very busy on a Friday and Saturday night. Even though we went on a Thursday it was still extremely busy! This was one of the highlights of our holiday and I don\u2019t think anyone can prepare you for what you will see!! It is indescribable! However, it must be said that Coco Bongo is not for everyone \u2013 the evening mixes the show and disco together consecutively. If you enjoy chart and dance music and also legends such as Madonna, Elvis, Michael Jackson, Queen, Lady Gaga and Usher you will have an incredible evening! Prepare to be up dancing for the whole night! Coco Bongo was $65 per person and included in the price was a coach to the club (which left the hotel just after 10 pm), VIP entry before others, free drinks for the entire night and a brilliant evening to remember!

Final Tips * the path through the jungle is rocky \u2013 although it may sound silly durable sandals are needed! No heels! * no air con in the lobby or main restaurant so can get quite hot * you can sometimes hear music playing from the neighbouring hotel from around 6:30 pm from block 23. * the departure tax is now 700 pesos per person or \u00a340 per person \u2013 dollars ARE NOT accepted. * at Cancun Airport they\u2019re quite strict with the luggage allowance and will charge \u00a315 for every kilo you are over!", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Preston, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for a relaxng beach holiday\u201d", "Author": "Phil C", "ReviewID": "UR117327337", "Content": "Overall very good service in the hotel and restaurants, slightly less so in the poolside bars/restaurants.

No complaints on the food. No one in our party got sick. The evening entertainment was fun, and they had one night of impersonationsof bands which was fantastic. The staff included the guests in the activities and dancing in the evening. They had many activities age appropriate for the teenage boys too. No complaints from this resort.

I have stayed here once before on the Tucan side and have stayed at two other Iberostar hotels and just for a general point of reference I have traveled over half the globe mostly at high end or luxury non-inclusive hotels and have stayed at over 20 all-inclusive hotels from lower mid-range to luxury. This particular Iberostar is the first one in Mexico and one of the first hotels in Playacar, built around 1989, most hotels in the Riviera Maya are 3 to 5 years old. The hotel itself is in excellent condition it is not a luxury hotel and can not be compared to the Hyatt Regency, A Mandarin Oriental or the Four Seasons and you are in Mexico so the standards and speed of service are different. Relax you are on vacation. The beach is picture postcard perfect. They have done a wonderfull job of rebuilding it after the huricane. The interior of the resort was left natural with both indigenous wildlife and other species brought in to compliment them. It is very relaxing walking through the center of the resort, just be carefull after it rains, some of the paving stones can be slipery. The pool area is fairly large, not as large as some of the lake size pools you will find at other resorts, but larger than average for an Iberostar, but many of the guests do play the towel game so it may be hard to find a chair in a premium location by 9am. The common area of the resort is nicer than average for a mid-range resort, tastefully elegant, with plenty of seating and a very Mexican laid back feel. The floors are all marble in these areas and when it rains they do become slippery, the staff makes a good attempt to keep them dry, but keep in mind in any resort in Mexico the fear of litigation is not the same as the US. The food is much better than average for an all-inclusive resort, this is not gourmet dining but you get what you pay for. The selection at the buffet is very good for all three meals, with a very good selection and I have not heard of anyone ever getting sick from the food, which is rare even in an upscale all-inclusive in Mexico. Keep in mind they are trying to please people from all over Europe, North America, Mexico and South America so the food is not Americanized. The service at the buffet is very good to excellent, the waiters tend to remember you and know what beverages you prefer. One thing to remember a small tip goes a long way. To people from other countries do realize the salaries the staff receives is quite small by US, Canadian or European standards and a small tip is the difference between working poor and middle class for these people, they work very hard and if one of their children were to fall sick the medication could equal a third to half of their weekly paycheck. Note the buffet's by the beach are better than average for an all-inclusiveand limited as to the food offerings, not as good as the main buffet and service is lacking or non-existant. The a la carte restaurants vary in quality the service is constantly good to excellent. the best is the Italian, never had a bad meal here, the Japanese is very good (not gourmet), the steak house is good the best thing you can order is the Filet. The Mexican strangely enough is so so, some dishes are good others are simply mediocre. The staff in general and the front bar staff in particular are excellent, they sometimes have an off day but are consistant like most Iberostar resorts, with some employees going above and beyond such as Henry. The front desk staff is good and profesional, not the best but still very good, remember they speak several languages and many of the more idiomatic phrases in English they do not understand. Drink quality at the main bars tends to be good, better than the beach, but they have more ingredients to work with and some top shelf brands. Do not expect Grey Goose or Remy Martin XO, they do have Smirnoff, Absolut, Johny Walker, Several othe brands of good Scotch, some nice aged Brandy a fairly good mid range aged Port and multiple brands of top shelf Tequila, you do have to ask for them or they will serve the well brand. the house wines are limited but much better than average for an all-inclusive, for dinner they do have have a wine list (extra), it is well thought out but very limited, with nothing that resembles a top five from the Wine Spectator. Rooms are comfortable, but dated, the floors and bathrooms are marble, both are fairly well appointed, but not luxury, the beds are hard as are most of the beds in Europe, the Carribean and Mexico, if the hotel is not an American brand that has a mostly American clientele. A matress pad can be ordered from the front desk, after doing so I have never had a bad night sleep. Do not ask the maids, they do not speak English very well, basically a few words of Hotel-English, they are not hired for their linguistic skills, but they do a very good job of cleaning the room and the towell art is always nice. The hotel is very good to excellent, a very good value if you get a deal, it's location next to Playa del Carmen is a plus, either a 30 minute walk or a five minute taxi ride (50pesos or five dollars). What the hotel lacks in gourmet dining is just a short distance away in Playa, the best restaurants are not on Quinta Avenida (5th Avenue) in the center, they tend to be just off 5th or on the northern end of the street. Playa del Carmen for those of you not familiar is very safe if you use common sense, as are most of the towns south of Cancun. For those of you that want an American hotel stay at the Marriot or Hilton in Cancun or any of the Fairmont hotels (and pay 3 to 4 times more with food and beverages), for people that want a great beach, a relaxing vacation, good food and great service I highly recomend the Quetzal or Tucan.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cAnother great Iberostar experience :-)\u201d", "Author": "starySwitzerland", "ReviewID": "UR116738330", "Content": "We just returned from our vacation in Mexico.

We had a large walk in shower with beautiful tile. Biggest complaint - super hard beds. Mattresses were like bricks. Seriously hard. Some family members claimed that it helped their backs feel better but it worked against me. The mini fridge was nice and our maids kept it stocked to the brim. The pool area was nice - very pretty.

I was @ Iberostar May 28th - June 4th, my 10th visit to this #1 resort. For me and perhaps you as well is the location of this property. Driving from the airport is under an hour, as in the bus you will have to wait as others get off @ their hotels. It gives you a feel to see where you won't be and you will notice how far the other resorts are from the \"center of town.\" Iberostar is located in a very very safe parameter of two entrances/exits gates. The main gate has a high wall with the words of \"Playacar\" The gates are average size with attendees holding the bus drivers identification to enter, and taxis are let in with us to enter back and forth. Once you are inside the \"main zone\" of Playa Del Carmen\" you will see the beautiful condos and other resorts. There is one shopping plaza across the street with a Starbucks for good coffee. Only about five minutes to walk from Iberostar. They have free internet I believe when you purchase a coffee, and their are public phones to use outside in the plaza. The hotel you have to pay at increments of 15 or 30 min used that day, then it expires. About 3 or 4 dollars. Not all phone cards work on all public phones. At the resort only their cards bought from the resort/stores work on-site phones. $20.00 for 1/2 hour or so I believe. You can buy phone cards from pharmacies @ the plaza and walk around and I know of three phones that accept different cards. Look for them in the back of the stores, as there are a few more shops as well back there. Prices are a bit too much here, but your last minute shopping it works. Shopping - I always go the very first day (s) to get it out of the way. I know some visitors do it on their last day and spent the whole day away from the ocean, and then get back and have to pack ;-). In town (not across the street plaza) near 5th avenue where you must go! You can shop at Walmart for all your Liquor, very reasonably prices. You can pack in your suitcase two bottles each person. And cigarettes are sold there too, I don't smoke but information for you. Just a suggestion for you. If you take a cab from resort into 5th avenue do your shopping their first, walk around and yes you can walk to Walmart, (just ask anyone to point which direction) then take the cab back to resort. Saves $$$, they raised the taxi fares from $5 to $7 now each way. Imagine if you don't stay in the \"main Zone\" at other resorts and take a taxi into town it could cost about $30.00 each way. Yes other resorts have shuttle service into town, but fyi about the taxis. If you don't leave the resort vendors come by the beach and sell silver, sunglasses, cigars, jewelry. Actually I purchase all my goods from them. It saves me time-as I'm a beach bum. Don't pay the price anyone wants!! They will come down in prices if you see something on the beach and to expensive they will come by in am and pm and same everyday, except Sunday, only a few. RESORT - After traveling all these years, this is my final destination. I love this resort for the fact that everything at Iberostar is very within reach!!!!!!!!! Some resorts are just too big yes this is big but I can handle the jungle or the sidewalk to get from one place to another. The beach is simply the biggest reason why I go to Iberostar. So so beautiful, the most prettiest shades of blue water and white sand. A lot of people feed the fish bread which I don't like, I don't like the fish around me. Pretty fish but oh well. You can run walk on this beach and see the other fifteen or so resorts and people watch. If you didn't know there are a lot of topless women here and almost every other resort. The pool is simply very big and has another separate pool for swimming laps. Usually this one is empty. You can take inflatable rafts to lay on, I do and pass them on to someone to keep, as I don't want to deal with bringing it back in the suitcase. It's also a good feeling for me to make some child light up with a big smile. The Iberostar has Tucan/Quetzal - same drive entrance you just go right or left. Has two reception sides and two lobbies with two different bars. Which you can drink at either one. Just walk around and explore. NOTE. The steak house at times have changed locations, either at the location where it's suppose to be or at the main buffet is at the beach. Men don't forget to bring long pants to enter into some of the restaurants. The food is very good with fish, meats, rice, soup, pizza, tacos, hamburgers, hot dogs, ect. Please bring enough of tipping money for these very kind sweet hard working people. They are in the hot hot sun serving you/me all day. I always bring $100 in singles to pass out to everyone. You won't regret staying here! You can also get a day pass to the other sister Iberostar's. The Paradiso is approximately 1/2 hour before the resort. You can watch for it on your bus ride. This resort is just too too big huge and away from everything. There is another Iberostar in Cozumel you can visit as well for free, eat and drink. But this one is across the ocean. A ferry boat takes you into town in Playa Del Carmen (cost $8 or so one way) then a $25 cab ride to the resort. Small bungalows are very cute, again far away from everything and their ocean is very shallow and rocky. Enjoy this resort you won't regret it, it truly is a fun fun beautiful time, location is perfect. You want location-trust my opinion. It is truly safe to go out of the resort. You will see all other people in town as well. Don't be afraid when you see soldiers with rifles-it is normal for years for ever. Soldiers have a headquarters in town. A lot of clubs for nigh life in town, walk down towards the beach. Towards \"Blue Parrot\" is where all the clubs are, with loud music and lots of pretty lights. They have night acts with fire. No need to exchange you money, only if you want to. I never do. If you do change your money at the resort don't forget to take your passport with you to the front desk. REMEMBER your room isn't ready until after 3:00 pm. Don't get mad and wait in the lobby, the maids are cleaning from the people who just spent a week or more for you. Pack your suit and shoes in your carry on and change in the lobby change room Yes your suitcases are fine and secure with the concierge. You will have your bracelet on and can eat and drink. Enjoy your vacation, this is the place for you and your family. A kids place for the kids small child pool swings and nursery for babysitting. The rooms have a safe for valuables-you decide the combination. Stocked fridge with water, beer, and pop.The on-site night club is air conditioned and starts happening after the main entertainment show ends.

My room was in between the restaurants and beach and although you could occasionally hear the entertainment at the hotel next door, it was perfect. Room was cleaned daily and the fridge was always re-stocked every 2 days with different towel art waiting for my return. Some people on here have complained about the beds being hard. Maybe its what you are used to but I had no problem sleeping. The beach was busy and beds were reserved well before 8.30 but there were plenty available. Beach was beautiful as was the sea and there were several bar staff taking drink orders and bringing them to you. A lovely idea! The Star Friends work so hard. Whether its during the day around the pool, on the beach or putting on the evening shows - and even dancing with the guests in the on site disco, they always looked like they were enjoying themselves and had so much enthusiasm.

Let me start by saying that i have been to Mexico 2 other times and stayed at both Excellence Resorts i don't think anything can compare to those resorts but in all fairness i wasn't looking for excellence quality because we had our kids with us we were looking for a resort to have fun with them and Iberostar more than fit the bill. The rooms were cleaned everyday and the food was adequate. We were able to reserve our 3 restaurants when we got there and then on the days we didn't have reservations we went back to see if there were any openings and there were so we only ate at the buffett for dinner the first night we arrived. We enjoyed all of them just keep in mind you aren't in the U.S so you won't get U.S quality food but everyone should be able to find something to eat. Hey if you don't like it order something else no big deal. The staff were wonderful except for 1 of the Lomas Rep. but no reflection on the hotel he doesn't for them. The Star Friends are a hard working crew full of energy and always smiling a shout out to Edu, Joshua and Harry Potter you guys rock. The beach is beautiful with white sand and blue water.

The beach was beautiful & the sea a beautiful shade of blue. The pool was enormous & lovely. The food was fantastic. We didn't find it at all repetitive. The hot food was always hot and always very tasty. All the restaurants were great and we especially liked the Japanese. The waiters were faultless & always had a smile on their face. Our room was in block 29 so probably the furthest away from the pool/ beach which at first we weren't happy with and asked to move but couldn't straigh away but after a couple of days we decided to stay put as we really enjoyed our daily walk through the hotel & best of all down the jungle paths seeing all the animals which consisted of Flamingos, Peacocks, MONKEYS, Iguanas etc, etc. Our room was very comfortable & roomy. As with other reviews the bed was a bit hard & within 30 minuted of asking we had a lovely soft matress topper on our bed. The maid service was faultless & the mini bar restacked every other day. The waiterss service on the beach (drinks) was great but if you coudn't wait the beach bar was a few steps away. There was ice cream on tap all day which was a bit hit with kids. The entertainment staff \"Star Friends\" were out of this world. Always happy, energenic with activities for every one all day & then they performed in the evening show most nights with amazing dancing skills. They were always there & some of the hardest working people I have ever come across. There is nothing bad that can be said about this hotel & I cannot wait to go back one day.

We also thought our photographers Jorge and Jhankarlo (Onsite Adventure Photos) did a fabulous job, and ended up purchasing the rights to all of our wedding photos they took. It was important to us to find a location that would be a good fit for our group of 58 guests of all ages (baby to grandparents). We could not have asked for a better location. Everyone had a great time and said it was the best wedding they had ever attended. We had our welcome dinner in the Restaurant Tulum (buffet). After our beautiful wedding reception on the beach, we had a cocktail hour on the beach complete with a mariachi band and the reception at the Tropical restaurant. The following day, we reserved the Hibachi restaurant for our farewell dinner. The beach was gorgeous (large, white sand with turquoise blue water) and plenty of beach chairs. The grounds were lush and we saw all kinds of animals throughout the week. This a medium sized resort, where you saw some familiar faces, but could do your own thing if you wanted. It was a short trip into Playa Del Carmen by taxi or via the beach, but there were plenty of things to do at the resort. Our group reserved several of the ocean front rooms for the week, and enjoyed the views and proximity to the beach and pools. If you are traveling to this resort for a special occasion, I would recommend upgrading. However, all those who did reserve a standard room, also enjoyed their rooms.

First when we arrived our room wasn't ready but, we were early for check in. When check in time arrived it was ready. Our room was always clean and the housekeeping staff was excellent. We always leave a dollar a day per person in the room. If you think your bed is to hard ask at the front desk for a mattress pad and they will put an egg crate cusion on for you. The resturants we tried were the Japanees, Caribbean, Italian, and Steak House. All were very good not wild about the Italian. We just aren't Italian food people. Nothing wrong with the food just not our style. The buffets, if you can't find something to eat there is something wrong. The Beach, our personal favorite, You just can't say anything about that! Had no problem getting chairs. Wait staff came by frequently. We tip about a dollar a trip for the staff, that gal was in the hot sand and sun. The pool was very warm and busy. Bars, Beach bar was efficient and friendly, beer not the coldest. Bar in the beach buffet resturant was friendly and accomadating. I love Mimosa's!!!!! You may have to wait for the bar to be open and we realized 8-8:30 is the time you can get one. Lobby, Always the best service and friendly staff, cold drinks served with a smile. Hats off to the entire staff. Jungle and walk ways are well kept but uneven. If you want to walk on more even ground go on the outside of the buildings. The jungle walk is always interesting with animals to see. The activity and show staff, Good Job guys and gals! If you only see a few shows go to the Mr. Iberostar and Miss. Iberostar shows. Very funny and fun. Also, saw the Magic show it was ok, great for the young ones. Our daughter played beach volley ball all day for days or just laying on the beach. She had a great time too. Not bored at all plenty to do for the young adults. My only complaint is that the halls in our building were not cleaned or picked up daily. This is minor. Wifi, Not happy about that, it is expensive for the week and only works in the lobby. I do agree with others on this matter of the resorts do need to make wifi available to the entire resort wide and not charge so much. At the time it was around 80usd for a week. We have stayed at many AI resorts in this area and this was our 4th visit to this resort. We love the service we get here. The staff is excellent and friendly.

The hotel has a very tropical feeling, yet it's comfortably... almost, luxurious. I couldn't believe the monkeys carrying-on in the trees overhead, the flamingoes, the peacocks wandering the wooded grounds. Everything was specatularly tidy. Our room was nicely outfitted (but built to withstand hurricanes: solid concrete) - a huge walk-in shower, marble on the floors and in the bath, refrigerator stocked with all the beer and sodas you could drink (at no extra charge), and a bed made comfortable by the addition of an eggcrate mattress pad (Ask and you shall receive!). We ate in one of their a-la-carte restaurants each night and enjoyed them all... the steaks were outstanding (it was a little warm in there, though - it's the only un-air-conditioned restaurant, it seems - and the breeze off the Carribean failed them that night), the Mexican food the next night was delicious, and the Japanese restaurant the last night an unexpected and fun treat. On the beachfront a gal walked by every thirty-minutes or so offering to bring you a fresh drink of whatever kind - or you could go and fetch your own as often as you liked (and/or grab a burger, hot dog, or ice cream)... all without charge. We took out a Hobie-Cat for an hour's sail, and I reconnected with an activity I'd last done as a young teen in the early-'70's. Too much fun! The next day we went on an organized bike-ride through the Playacar neighborhood... now my wife would like to buy a place on the golf course, there. We did discover a little shopping area about 300 yards from the hotel that included a Starbucks with free wifi and a handful of knick-knack shops. I'd recommend this place to anyone seeking a comfortable place to relax - and sleep, eat, and drink well. You'll enjoy the beach, the sparkling pools, the buffets at breakfast and lunch (and, I suppose, supper - they looked good at supper-time). They seemed to have lots of activities planned for the youngsters; I didn't see a bored-looking child the entire time we were there.

Not many selections as other hotel I have stayed but ok to eat. I usually got tired of eating the same food after 2-3 days no matter where I stayed. There were limited reserved restaurant for dinner. We like steak house and Japanese house. Food was bit too salty at Japenese house but we and the kids like the performance of the chefs. They were great. You are going to like it. room: smallest compare with the other 4 hotels I had been to. However, I did not care much for the area. All I care is that it was clean and not smell. Room equipped with tube TV. Some had Flat screen TV with satellite. No DVD. Movie on demand 50 pesos per movie. Show: start around 9:30 PM. Lots of smoke and no AC. Did not watch any. Can't comment. Activities: one big gigantic long pool. 5-5.5 foot deep. Only 10% of the pool is shallow enough for kids and pool activity. One swim up bar which allowed no kids. Very few people stays in this pool since it is isolated and not well kept. Pool entertainments were alright. I had seen better activities elsewhere. Beach: Beautiful beach with plenty of chairs. Beautiful sandy beach. No rock. We took some bread out to feed the fish and we got the whole school of angle fish coming to us. Kid loved it. They were invisible without bread. They only came for food and off they went. No need to reserve chairs in the morning for pool or beach. There are plenty of chairs. In fact you may end up loosing your towels if you leave it on the chair. The cleaning crew will clean it up. It's 10 dollars per lost towel. Please keep that in mind Hotel have and very natural jungle look which makes it stands out from others. We spotted monkeys, feed the peacock, flamingo, and lots of other creatures. My kids had a blast! 5th ave shopping: 5 min drive from the hotel. cost $7 per cab (not per person) one way. Lot of food and things to shop. Expensive though. Be prepare to hag! Never pay retail. Trip to Cozumel: We took a boat to cozumel and stay there in a sister Iberostar hotel in cozumil during the day for free. Free to use their emenities and service. Not room. Snorkel right at the hotel. Equipments were free. $2 per person for marine park fee. Walk out the pier and down the ladders. Lots of fish ! even a lot more when I feed them bread. Boat round trip cost $28 per person. $35 for big van one way and $15 for small sedan one way. The price they asked were much higher than that. tips: bring insect repellent. Lots of mosquitoes. Topical Benadryl would be great. tip the receptionist. YOu may get your room faster and better room. Buiding 21, 22 are closer to the pools. There are best. Buiding 20 has ocean view. Must pay upgrade $50 or 60 per night I'm not sure. I tipped the bus boy and house cleaning. I think they work very hard for their money. Ziplock bags to take bread to the beach for the fish. Bring large mug to avoid freq refill of drink At the airport, GO STRAIGHT TO YOUR BUS. DON'T STOP FOR ANYTHING! They will try every mean to get luggage from you and carry them for 20 yards and expect tips. Don't fall for it. Minor problem: small tiny black ants in room and where food present (cafeteria).

I am not going to repeat the numerous other posts and talk about animals or the beauty of the place, I will say that the resort is a solid 5 star, not because it does not have faults, but because of service. We have stayed at the Four Seasons in Kona at $1650 a night and this hotel\u2019s service blew them away. I have also stayed at numerous all inclusive resorts throughout Mexico and the Caribbean and nothing has even come close to the Quetzal/Tucan Hotel. That was the short of it, now for details that I had wished I had known. I stayed at the Quetzal and booked through a travel agent who then booked it through Loomis travel and finally Fun Jet. Won\u2019t talk too much about the flight, except to say that we flew on US Airways, and were surprised to find that they charge $25.00 per checked bag. Four bags to and from, an unexpected $200.00 charge. Also, only soft drinks, water, and coffee/tea are free, everything and I mean everything else is at a cost. Just be forewarned. After landing in Cancun, it took a little over an hour to get through customs, here is where is gets good. As you are leaving the airport, there is a room that you must pass through with car rental booths, money exchange, etc. The exchange rate at the airport is very low. Better to exchange your money in town, or at your hotel. In this room you will see 25 -30 people all dressed in black pants, white shirts with black ties, all walking around talking on cell phones looking very important. I think they are on a up system, as only one approached us, welcomed us to Mexico, then asked to see our transfer documents. I asked him which company he was with, he then asked me who I was looking for, question with a question. Red Flag, time share salesmen. I told him he was not our transfer company and we proceeded to walk around him. Tried to physically stop us, had to push him away, he then trash talked us as we passed by. My advice is walk through the room quickly, acknowledge no one, just keep walking regardless of what they say. Outside was a breath of fresh air where we where we greeted by the Fun Jet representative \u201cRuby\u201d. He talked about how to avoid time share people in the future and spent a good half an hour just talking and being friendly with my family. He told us he was arranging our transportation, and he was attempting to get us our own personal transportation so that we did not have to stop at any other resorts. There is an outside booth selling drinks, ordered two Tecate Beers, was shocked when they asked for $12.00 U.S. \u201cRuby\u201d motioned over to a newer Lincoln Navigator, loaded our luggage, gave us our final instructions. Fun Jet personal all wear white pants, teal shirts and white ties, if you need help at the resort of any kind they are there to assist you. I tipped him $10 U.S., which he tried not to take. The ride to the Quetzal, took about 45 minutes, the driver, also Fun Jet, offered us complementary Coronas that he had on ice in a cooler. Nice touch, again class act on Fun Jet\u2019s part. Once at the hotel we received the VIP treatment opening doors and carrying our baggage to the hotel bellman. The driver waiting until the bellman acknowledged us. Tip to the driver $20 U.S. The hotel lobby is quite impressive and rich looking, we walked up to the check-in counter and were greeted with fruit drinks and a warm smile. Check-in, we were asked our name, then asked how many adults and how many children. We had planned this as my son did not want a children\u2019s white band. I said three adults one child. We received our bands and completed a form for each of us, using the information on our passports to complete the forms. Yes, my son fudged the date of his birth on the form and they never requested to see his passport. They did however make a copy of both my wife\u2019s and my passport. Here is the important part, they DO NOT request a credit card at check in, so no holds by the hotel on your credit card. However, if you do plan to have charges on your room and you plan to pay at the end with a credit card, make sure the card has your full legal name on the card or they might not accept it. For example if your name is Robert Smith and the name on your credit is Bob Smith, their finance department most likely will not accept it. Another important thing to point out is that the lobby cash machine gives American dollars, however if you pull out $200, it will cost you $30 US. Every time you are connected to the phone operator is 50 Pesos, even when using a calling card. If you do not use a calling card it is 50 pesos per minute. There are two places to buy calling cards, in the lobby next to the cash machine $20 U.S. only and in the gift shop $250 Pesos. Both cards give you 22 minutes. We were then transported to our rooms via golf cart. We had two rooms side by side, one for the kid\u2019s and one for us. Please note they do not have adjoining rooms, which because they are teenagers I liked. We were on the third floor in the 2200 block, our balcony was facing the RIU entertainment stage which we really enjoyed when we were out on the balcony. Once inside you could not hear a thing. Rooms are super clean and very nice, a strong 4 star room. Beds are firm, but we were happy. Bathrooms are laid out kind of funky as you have to maneuver around the door to get to the toilet, big 2 person shower. Room has a mini bar stocked with beer, soda & water. I have read posts that say there is a barman that restocks your fridge, we only saw our maid do it. A big tip here, no matter how much you leave for the maid or put money in the fridge, if you leave empty beers all over the room, you will find no more beer being stocked in your room, again just from our experience. Here is something else that is a bit weird, no ashtrays in the rooms or on the balconies. We asked and our maid said she could not do that, so we used a glass from the room \uf04c You make dinner reservations at the customer service kiosk, in front of the shops in the lobby. You can reserve them ahead of time by emailing Luz Hern\u00e1ndez, rrpptucque@iberostar.com.mx. You can also request room preference at the same time, however, there are no guarantees on your room requests. We picked up our reservations at the Kiosk, as we had reserved the Mexican restaurant the first night, and showed up 30 minutes late because we could not find it. The Mexican Restaurant turned us away because you can be no more than 15 minutes late at any of the ala carte restaurants. Went to kiosk the next day to re-book the Mexican Restaurant, she told there were no openings. Passed her 40 pesos and she found one. Another big tip, if you make a dinner reservation, make sure you locate the restaurant earlier in the day before your reservation time. People say that the Quetzal/Tucan are identical, I would agree, except when it comes to the buffets which are quite fancy for a buffet I might add. The buffet at the Tucan seemed to cater more to European tastes, which we ate at our first night when we missed our dinner reservation. We were not thrilled with the Tucan Buffet, as we were never sure what we were putting on our plate. We are not big buffet people even here in the states, but the Quetzal had a wonderful buffet. So much to choose from, fresh and hot, even had blue cheese for your salad. Again the nicest Buffet I have ever been to, with servers constantly attending to you. I have been to numerous all inclusive, the food selection and service made it hard to believe it was included at no extra charge. We always left $40 pesos, did not see anyone else leave a tip at the buffets in the 7 days we were there, which is sad as the employees only make $8.00 per day. Speaking of Ala carte restaurants, we went to three, the Mexican, Steak House and Japanese. There was no favorite as they are all excellent, the Mexican and the Japanese are very fancy, which is why you must dress in pants and a long sleeve shirt, they both also have frosty cold air conditioning which you will really appreciate. The Japanese was cooked in front of you and was slightly better than Benny Hanas with the exception that the chef cooks at two tables at the same time. So you are looking at his back a lot of the time. Food was wonderful. The Mexican served traditional Mexican food, however the atmosphere and service were excellent, we have never been to a nicer Mexican restaurant. Food was awesome. The Beach Buffet becomes the Steak House at night, casual attire is fine, not to be confused with beach wear. Because it was casual I was prepared to be disappointed, but that could not have been further from the truth. One of the best steaks we have had and our favorite steak house in the States is Ruth Chris. Two of us had the Tenderloin, which turned out to be Filet Mignon, which was overwhelming as the steaks were 12 oz and cut with a butter knife. My wife had the Porterhouse, which was fantastic, and my son had the beef ribs, also very tasty. They also have a seafood restaurant, Tropical something, but I was told they have fresh lobster & shrimp, FYI. Should have booked there as well \uf04c Again, if you tip the girl at the customer service kiosk, I imagine you can eat at the ala carte\u2019s as much as you would like. Speaking of the Beach Buffet, unlike the other buffet\u2019s who only serve beer and wine, you can get mixed drinks with breakfast and lunch here. The breakfast here is out of the world, omelets made to order, along with a variety of other traditional breakfast items, but their bacon was my favorite, perfectly cooked for my taste. The star attraction here are their Bloody Mary\u2019s , out of this world if you like a spicy Bloody Mary. This resort is huge, with the pool and beach at one end and the lobby at the other. I would guess at least 1/2 Mile from end to end. This was the only bummer, eight trips a day back and forth really has an effect on your feet and legs. We started our trip in flip flops. The second day demanded tennis shoes due to the blisters between our toes. If you are going here, be prepared to walk and I mean a lot. You can walk through the jungle which is the fastest or you can take the outside paths and hope to hitch a ride on an employee golf cart. They will not just stop, we had to hold our thumb out, just like hitchhiking, well worth it though. In the resort, high heels have no place, in fact, the decking leading up to the lobbies have spaced boards that would certainly make it quite impossible to get there safely. My wife said if you insist on fancy dress shoes, make sure they are wedges, as your heels WILL get stuck between the boards. Speaking of shoes, never go barefoot, a lot of marble floors everywhere. Always wear something with traction, never know when the marble is wet. I can speak to that personally, slipped twice and thought I had a concussion both times. Also saw a lot of other people slip and fall, although staff is always right there for you. The main pool is huge and has something like coves where you can get a little peace and quiet. Although the shallow end by the beach bar is where all the music and action happens. You can always find a chaise lounge due to the resorts policy of charging $10 US Dollars if you lose your towel. Only a blue towel can reserve a chaise lounge, which keeps the people that normally get up at the crack of dawn to reserve chairs at a minimum. They try and hold a chair with a magazine or hotel water bottle, but the staff will remove it for you upon request. The pool area is a blast, most of the Europeans keep to themselves, but then you have the folks from Holland, England, Scotland and of course Texas that made our trip a blast. Funny thing is, nobody remembers names, so everyone called each other by where they were from !! We were called Oregon. They have 6 servers for the entire pool, which means tipping is mandatory for excellent service. As I have said, most people do not tip, they wait probably 1 Hour between drinks or walk to the beach bar. We tipped 20 pesos per round (2 drinks) and were served every 20-30 minutes and that was great considering the ground she was covering. We had all of the non-tippers flocking to where we were when they saw her keep coming over with our drinks on a regular basis. They have Star Friends that entertain at the pool area and beach, lots of cool games that even adults will have fun doing. The Star Friends are also entertainers at night and seem genuinely over the top friendly. We are pool people, but the beach was gorgeous with numerous empty chaise loungers. The best spots on the beach are the closest to the pool and/or beach bar, saw people getting and staying there at 8:00 AM on one morning, again no chair games would work in this area, use it or lose it. The service on the beach is lacking, but I won\u2019t complain. There were 2 servers covering a lot of area, and walking in sand with a tray full of drinks cannot be easy. Also one day they had the chefs on the beach cooking seafood out of a giant wok, fresh crab it was wonderful. They also have a place right on the beach that has hot dogs and hamburgers, really good, quick and easy. They also have beach volleyball contests every day and mechanical bull riding which was comic. The adult swim up pool bar is a blast and probably home to the strongest mixed drink you will get at the resort. We had maybe 12 strawberry daiquiris at the main pool one day, went to the adult pool ordered some daiquiris and instantly knew what we were missing, alcohol \uf04a The staff at the pool bar bend over backwards to make you happy . It is also a great place to meet people from all over the world in a relaxed fun atmosphere. I have read posts that say people do not leave the adult pool to use the restroom, however when I was there people used the bathroom more so than at the main pool which was unfortunately rarely. I guess that goes for all resorts and/or drinking and public pools. A tip here goes a long way, the bartender really must not see many people here that tip. Kept the bar open for us an extra \u00bd hour after the official close which was at 5:00 pm. I think the disco was the biggest shocker. From all the posts we read, we were expecting the disco to be cheesy, mostly for kids, NOT. This place has a state of the art sound system that rocks and they play today\u2019s popular hip hop, techno, and dance music. I was quite impressed. Sure the disco was filled with a lot of younger people, but my wife who is in her mid 40\u2019s had a blast dancing. We danced a few times, but the beat of the music is so fast I had to sit down. She continued dancing by herself or with some ladies she met from Texas. There is a bar on each side of the disco, and also a server walking around. Service here as well was phenomenal. The disco is open until 3:00 a.m., and my kids shut it down every night. I was a little nervous about letting my 15 year old daughter go there, but it turned out fine. Her brother kept tabs on her. I would not suggest sending your daughter there alone, as there are predators in the disco that will try to take advantage of young girls. We had an issue with a 29 year old guy from Argentina, had to tell twice to keep his hands off of our 15 year old daughter, once not so nicely. The Star Friends do go to the disco to watch out for the kids, but they can only do so much. If your daughter wants to go to the disco, I suggest you go along. My wife and I sat on one side of the disco, and the kids were on the other. One night at the disco and our kids were running around the resort with all their new teenager friends the next day, if you think your teen ager will be bored, put that worry to rest. If you are in the disco with your children, and you give the bartender the OK, they will serve your child a limited number of \u201cfoo foo\u201d drinks which are watered down, but no shots. They will not, however, serve an underage teen without you being present. The disco is located just outside of the main lobby to the right. The lobby bar is a nice, quiet place to have a drink and relax. They had nightly musical talent, including an acoustic guitar player, a keyboard player, and even a Mariachi. There are 3 girls working the lobby, including the bar, and if you tip them, they will fight for your table, so service here was never a problem. The only drawback on the lobby bar is that it is open, and very hot and humid in there. The ceiling fans offered no relief as they were barely turning. You would occasionally get a cool breeze off the ocean which was refreshing.

My wife and I read review after review about the good and the bad of this hotel and still ended up choosing this as our vacation destination. The price was within our budget and the stories of the wildlife drew us in. Here is the breakdown: For the money, you can't beat this place. If you want to stay at prim and proper hotel, why are you looking at an all inclusive? If you are looking for an enjoyable place to stay where you can eat, drink and relax, then this place is for you. The food is just fine. Is it something that I'd write home about? The answer is no. It's an all-inclusive resort that serves buffet style food for hundreds of people from 6am-4am everyday of the week. I'm sure you'll find something that you'll like, but if you are looking for lobster and a porterhouse, you are at the wrong place. The staff is unbelievably nice and attentive. They bring you drinks at the pool, the lobby and even the beach!! They are fast and not a single person there expected to be tipped and appreciated it when they were. The pool is beautiful and well sized. Now I'm sure you'll read that people were up early to reserve chairs by the pool and wah wah wah they didn't have enough chairs. Well, there are hundreds of people at a hotel and only so much space available. They really have an adequate amount of chairs, but they do fill up quite fast. However, this is the same with any hotel you go to that has nice weather. They do have a towel card policy which means one card equals one towel per person That sucks, but I'm sure people steal towels all the time and this limits this from happening. One thing that was annoying were the pool chairs. They are plastic and people don't treat them well and some are broken and won't stay up right. It gets annoying and hopefully they fix this problem, but that was the worst thing about the entire place. They say they close the pool at 7pm, but never once did someone yell at us for being in past 8pm. They do try and clean the pool when it \"closes\" but are very nice about letting you have fun. The beach is gorgeous and 1000 times better than most \"private\" all-inclusive beaches can be. There are tons of wild life all throughout the hotel from monkeys, flamingos, and turtles. The hotel is big and spaced out so a moderate amount of walking is required. The path to the pool is in stone and when it's raining it gets wet so just be careful, but by no means do I think it's something dreadfully unsafe. No the hotel doesn't have A/C throughout. It's an open hotel and has fans throughout. If you get hot easily, plop yourself below and fan and cool off. You'll be fine. The rooms were what we expected them to be and the beds were a little hard, but it's really not THAT bad. My wife and I would stay there again in a heartbeat and really enjoyed our stay. It will be busier if you go in peak season, but they are very accommodating and friendly there. We recommend this place to anyone down to earth.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cA good value (and a brief comparison with Riu Tequila)\u201d", "Author": "sealover_7", "ReviewID": "UR115165371", "Content": "Here is my modest contribution to Trip Advisor that we use everytime we book a vacation. We spent two excellent weeks at the end of June at the Iberostar Quetzal. It was our third visit to Mexico and the second to Playacar. We returned to this area because we love the safe, wide, tree-bordered boulevard that leads to Playa, the beach and the Caribbean waters. A couple of years ago, we stayed at Riu Tequila. Here is my two-cent contribution: ACCOMODATION Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan is unique in two things: it is built on two sides of a jungle ravine and it provides beach umbrellas that allow you to sit anywhere on the beach. We got a spacious room (king bed, two additional sofa beds) on the second floor in building 27. The room was kept very clean. The maid restocked the fridge with our favorite beer (Dos Equis) and water (Aqua minerale). The bathroom was beautiful and very functional, but the toilettries (soap, shampoo and lotion) are bad smelling (bring your own soap!). The AC worked fine and the bed was not bad at all (a little hard, but nothing to be upset about). The balcony overlooked the flamingo pond. It was a thrill to watch the 11 gracious birds every morning and afternoon. The pond was visited by egrets, a tall crowned crane, racoons and several other rodents. We saw the howling/growling black monkeys on several occasions: in the trees above the rectangular swimming pool and also in the trees across from our balcony and on the roof of building 26 (see picture). The only nuisance was the noise. Peacocks (beautiful, majestic birds) emit loud cries, day and night, so loud that they wake you up. We had one on the balcony for two nights which were sleepless! Every time we shoo-ed it away, it came back! In the end, together with the neighbours, we placed empty garbage cans and the gallon bottle of water at the top of the separation wall of the balcony. We also put pillows on the balcony chairs and table and in the end it did not come anymore. What a relief! I loved the jungle life; there was something new every day, but next time I'll request a room not facing the jungle! FOOD was good everywhere: varied, clean, lots of meat, fish and seafood. They have an excellent pastry chef (desserts were the best I had anywhere). We tried all the 'a la carte', some twice. We loved the italian (excellent appetizers, pasta and lasagna) and the japanese (very good sushi and outstanding show by the chef). The steak house was mediocre and the mexican served an unedible, bitter 'tequila-flamed skewers'. ENTERTAINMENT: very good! StarFriends (4 girls and 11 boys) are very talented dancers. They work 14 hours a day: in the morning they canvass the beach, talking to everyone and they setup some games, pool aerobics, dance lessons, you name it. At the same time, they rehearse for the evening show. Shows were quite good, some excellent. The resort has also a band and 3 singers. After each show (at ~ 10:30 p.m.), they play/sing latin music and try to engage everyone to learn the dance steps. It was a lot of fun, but we were drenched in sweat (no AC). The disco club (11 p.m. - 3 a.m.) has ice-cold AC but starts very slowly. The same StarFriends came several times to help warming up people to dance. The gym has AC, is small but well equipped. BEACH and pool were outstanding. Thumbs up to mexicans who managed to restore the badly eroded beach of 3-4 years ago to a splendid wide, long, white-sanded paradise. On the left, on Quetzal side there are only two rows of palapas and it smells gasolline badly due to the loading point of all the scuba, snorkeling, parasailing boats, right in front. On the Tucan side, there are 5 rows of palapas and lots of space. Giving out beach umbrellas is an excellent idea. No other resort does this, from Sandos to Playa del Carmen. Pool is large, but water too warm. Many chairs, all under palapas. There is another pool, rectangular, very good for swimming, located behind the Quetzal-side beach restaurant. The swim-up bar is a joke, uninviting and almost empty. TRIPS: went 4 times to Playa, did all the shopping there (Playacar plaza, closer to the hotel is slightly more expensive and they don't bargain). We took a tour to Chichen Itza from bamboutours (Playa). Paid $48/pp, no strings attached (no timeshare presentation). The tour company was EasyTours. They use minivans and have many of them on the road. We had an excellent guide/driver: Julio, an encyclopedia of Yucatan and Mexico history. We saw not only the amazing Chichen Itza, but also the unique cenote of Ik Kil, 26 m below surface, 60 m wide and 40 m deep, populated by black catfish that swim with you. We also stopped to Valladolid, which has a very pretty historical centre. For the money we paid, it was very good. IberoTours (in Tucan lobby) had a promotion of $69 but only Chichen Itza, half day. Playacar Plaza people asked for $69, same tour as we did or half price if we attended a 'presentation'. Comparison with Riu Tequila is very brief: Ibero Tucan/Quetzal is superior in everything, except one: the buffet restaurant. The room at Riu was dingy, painted in green and awfully smelling mold. Bathroom was old, rusty, ventilation poor. Beach is quite far if your room is at the back of the resort, and very crowded (3 Riu hotels on the same stretch of beach). But.....the buffet restaurant was so good that we did very few of the a la carte. Go to Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan! We'll go back too!", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin", "Title": "\u201c\"Much more than I expected!\"\u201d", "Author": "TXSTravelover", "ReviewID": "UR115143266", "Content": "This was my 1st all inclusive vacation so I was a bit skeptical of the quality of the resort especially given the price I paid for my trip ($599 including air, tips, transfers, luggage, etc) through Shannon at www.goawaytravel.com). However, from the moment we stepped into the beautiful open air lobby it was fantastic. The staff was helpful, the grounds immaculately kept, and our room was nice sized with a comfy bed, nice patio, and GREAT walk in shower (this was the standard room). The resort maintained the natural beauty of the area (jungle) with many trees, flowers, waterfalls, etc. throughout. There was SO much wildlife wandering around freely on the property that it was an attraction in and of itself. We delighted in taking pictures and learning about all the varieties of birds, fish and animals ranging from flamingos, Hocofaisan, Grulla Coronada, monkeys, Tzereque, iguanas, tortoises, just to name a few. The Star Friends (entertainment coordinators onsite) did a fantastic job of providing us with activities and entertaining us nightly with Broadway revues, magic shows, singing and dancing. There was always so much to do through out the day thats included in the price of your stay, but you never feel forced to be part of anything you don't want to be. The property is so huge, you can be \"in the thick of things\" or find a quiet spot to sit and relax by the pool, beach, or one of the many bars on property. The food was good and they offered a nice variety for everyone and the free icecream stand was a huge hit with kids and adults alike. The beach and water was clean with the massive swimming pool not far away for those who tired of the salt water and sand. I will most definitely go back and would recommend this to any family looking for a quality place to stay for not a lot of money. One of the best and cheapest vacations I've taken in a long time.

The Tucan and Quetzal share the same amenities and restaurants so it doesn't really matter which resort you end up booking. Each resort does have their own lobby. From the lobby perspective the Tucan is on the right side and the Quetzal is on the left. The rooms are located in small buildings that are three stories tall that have maybe 12 units (guessing). So the rooms that you stay in are not located in one long continuous building as other resorts. We really loved this resort and the layout. The resort has a jungle that you have to walk through to get to the pools and beach. There is a rock paved path that meanders through a dense wooded area and you will see some animals along the way. We were lucky enough to see the howler monkeys in the trees on two occasions. Really neat to see. They have peacoks roaming about, there is a section where the pinkest flamigos hang out by a pond. At night the path is lit up by lights that come from something that looks like a fire hydrant next to the walk way. The staff in their entirety were all friendly and accomodating and would greet you with a \"Hola\" when they walked by. Everyone could speak atleast some english and would be able to mix a little english with spanish to assist you in trying to speak some basic things. Never encountered a time when an employee could not understand english as we had happen a lot in the Dominican Republic. The rooms were clean, roomy enough and had a balcony. The bathrooms were nice and had a large shower that was fully tiled with stone and has a shower curtain so no water on the floor. Nice wide counter top and well lit. Maid service did a great job each day and always had freshly stocked towels, and drinks in the refrigerator. There was always some kind of towel decoration left on one of the beds with flower petals at times. The room always smelled fresh and never had a musty or mildew smell. The beds as other people mentioned are very hard/firm. Never felt anything like it but we decided the first night to give it a try and ended up never asking for a mattress top pad. We had a room with two double sized beds and there is a day bed if needed, if not acts as a couch. Our room had a flat screen TV, if you chose to watch it. The air conditioner worked perfectly for us, has a thermostat that you can control the temp and fan speed. The rooms also has a ceiling fan. You can get room service free at any time. The restaurants are very nice, food in the buffets was actually pretty good. Always something to eat. The dinner buffet always has a mexican fare, but also has pasta, hamburgers, hot dogs, a carving station for the meat or fish of the day, a lot of fresh fruit and deserts. The alla carte restaurants were very good. We stayed 5 nights and were only allowed two dinner reservations, but were told we could check back each afternoon to see if there were any cancellations. The pool was very large and for the most part is deep, so watch you step going into the pool using the stairs because the last step is about two feet from the pool floor for some reason. The water is about 4 to 4 1/2 feet deep, but has one section that has the long gradual slope for easy entry and for kids. They have a seperate small kids wading pool, they also have a seperate small pool just for a swim up bar with tables and seats. There is no swim up bar at the main pool. The are so many lounge chairs around the pool, most with palapas. The beach also has an abundant amount of loungers which a large section that have palapas. They also have umbrella's to rent for the beach if you come at a time when all the chairs by the palapas are full. There are some people that put towels on chairs early, but the resort post signs saying that reserving chairs is prohibited and you can bring it to their attention, but did not find that to be a problem. The beach has fine sand, clean, and the entry into the beach was perfect. The entire beach front was absolutely perfect, no rocks,no trash, no grass at all and the water as clear as can be. As a side note the resort does not use disposable plastic cups at all so the drinks come in a hard reusable plastic cup since the resort is eco friendly. The beach has a very large area for swimming with the buoys pretty far out. The water most days is pretty calm which they use a yellow flag for. Some other days its a little wavey that can be large and the red flag is out, but it is definitly not anything that keeps people from going in. Those days are a lot of fun jumping and playing in the waves. They have a few ladies that will come by and take your drink orders and collect the empty cups which is real nice. There is a bar right at the entrance to the beach so not a far walk if you dont want to wait. Just a note, the resort i guess due to it being eco friendly does not provide water bottles anywhere EXCEPT your room. If you want bottled water you have to bring it from your room, or else you can get water in a cup which if filtered. Careful with the sun, we used suncreen and started to get burned so make sure you have some higher SPF just in case. There are two restaurants that are right next to the beach and pools for breakfast and lunch so you do not have to travel far to eat. During the day you walk in with your bathing suit on, as long as you are not dripping wet. They had an ice cream station outside that you could get an ice cream cone during the day. There have all sorts of activities planned each day and the staff will come around and remind you/ask you if you would like to particpate. They have a theater with a differnt theme each night that starts at 9:00 or so. Prior to that around 8:00 they have band playing, and some volunteer audience members come up on stage to play games which is always funny to watch. Playa Del Carmen is about a mile or so away. We took a cab that is 7.00 each way and we had 4 people. You could walk there but we chose to save our energy for walking aournd town since it was pretty hot. The town is very nice with all the shopping centered around 5th avenue and is many blocks long. A lot of the stuff is repeated store after store but its still nice to look around for something different. Plently of restauarants, ice cream places, or just places to get something to drink. Felt perfectly safe around town, no issues at all. Try to go and atleast spend a few hours walking around. The shops open around 9am and stay open till around 8 or 9pm. I can't say enough about the Iberostar. Had an excellent time and would not hesitate to come back. We are hoping to return next year. We always felt completely safe!! No one harasses you and any of the vendors that are selling stuff are completely fine with a No, and will not push you unless you are interested in possibly buying. The make up of the resort vacationers is a wide variety of people from all over the world so you will hear a lot of different languages spoken.

First choice use tucan thomas cook use quetzal & thomas cook are about \u00a3200 cheaper! You can't pay your depature tax in dollars only sterling or mexican paesos! Book your trip through ibero services & save money & time. We booked xplore/ xcaret & had an open ticket could be used any day during your 14 day stay get your own taxi to here as both are only ten minutes away go & come back when you like no dropping off at 6 or so hotels & leaving at 7.30am when the park opens at 9am taxi's are very reasonable & they all have set prices! Xhal-ha is a lovely day although it's quite a long coach journey & too far for a taxi for these reasons we prefered xcaret! If you can afford to do the sea trek go for it you have to pay extra at xhal-ha & xcaret but it's a great experience! The hotel staff are lovely & provide great service wether you tip or not! We tip either one dollar or twenty paesos a time, we tipped little & often to a variety of staff! But if your polite & friendly that's enough for the staff! Carlito on the quetzal side is the best barman in the whole resort, especially his mojitos!! Coco bongos in playa del carmen is great night out, it's a bar owned by Jim Carey & it's a las vegas style party, you can't help but have fun! Again no need to go on your reps organised trip just ask ibero services for info & jump in a taxi 7 dollars each way you pay one price & drinks are included you can pay extra for a waiter & a seat, we did this, careful though we ended up legless!! Good job the taxi's are right outside! If you need money they have cash points in the lobbys or you can change currency at reception. Sometimes when you spend dollars in the shop they give you the change back in paesos all items priced in paesos but they'll give you the price in dollars just ask! You can visit cancun easily by getting the bus from playa del carmen it's 4 dollars round trip! If you fancy a trip to cozumel on the ferry it's under 20 dollars return! If you should be unlucky like me & be poorly on holiday the chemist sell prescription only meds at very reasonable prices so don't suffer with anything, lots of people speak english so it's quite easy to get help! There's a little plaza up the road where you can get all your essentials from so if you forget anything don't worry it's a 5 minute walk on a lovely road & it's very safe! Right that's my alternative review, we've been 3 times and this hotel has more repeat guests than your local boozer, that says everything to me!!! I honestly can't fault it, it's beautiful!

We travel alot and have been on many AI vacations. This was my 2nd stay at the Quetzal and 4th Iberostar. Overall we found it to a good vacation and gave the resort a solid B. The rooms are fine, not the fanciest but not bad. We enjoyed the english speaking TV, mini bar and having a drink on the balcony. We switch rooms after the 1st day and found the 2nd better due to softer beds. We had an issue with the toilet in both rooms. It was eventually fixed but not quickly. We loved the grounds and really found the beach to have recovered from the previous damage. It was beautiful!! The pool is huge and we never had a problem with finding a chair. The pool side service was spotty but they have 3 bars to serve you if you don't mind getting up to order. I didn't mind seeking my own and usually went to the restaurant bars as they have better quality alcohol. I enjoyed drinking champagne and each bar has a different type. Overall the staff and service were not great and often urked my husband. He felt they were just doing the minimum but lacked interest. We liked to particapate in the activities, they were really fun and made us laugh. The star staff was very talented but they were the least engaging entertainment staff we have ever enountered and you would often see them grouped together talking to each other not guest. This made my oldest daughter a bit annoyed since she is used to a staff that likes to talk and remembers your name. We were there 9 days and they never spoke to us even though we particapated daily. They were however the best performers we have ever seen at a resort and the shows were really good and always humorous. We met others return guest who shared our opinion but still we were all having fun. My 9 yr. old daughter did the kids club and had a really good time. Michelle in the kids club was by far the best star friend. She was really having fun with them and after she finished she worked on the evening entertainment staff. She was always happy and a joy to be around. As for the food, it was between good and not so good but we always found something to eat that satisfied us. Room service was great to have and came quick. The last comment is on the internet. It was 70 USD a week and only avail. in the lobby. It is 2011 a daily necessity and they really need to change that. Even if they added a couple of bucks to the rate it would better than stinging you with the high add on fee and leaving you feeling ripped off. For the above reason we paid it! UURRGGGG! All in all we all enjoyed ourselves but some us more than others. I would return but don't think my hubsand would.

Background: Please see my Trip Advisor profile for information about me including travel experience. For this trip, I was a solo traveler and decided on the Cancun area. I was in Mexico for 11 days and decided on splitting my trip up among 2 different resorts and areas. Although the check in process and transportation can be a hassle, I enjoy experiencing various resorts and room types whenever I go somewhere for a week or longer. I decided on staying at the Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan while in Playa Del Carmen. I also stayed at the Grand Oasis Cancun. Resort Area: The resort is in a guarded and gated community called Playacar which consists of several different resorts and condominiums. Don\u2019t let the gates scare you from exploring outside of Playacar because the area is completely safe both inside and outside of the gates. I explored downtown Playa Del Carmen and loved it! There are streets and streets of shops, restaurants, nightclubs and tour operators. It\u2019s only a 5 minute ($5 USD) ride from the hotel and there are countless taxi\u2019s lining the bustling streets ready to take you anywhere you want to go. Local Economy: You can expect to find all the convenience you\u2019d find at home. This includes transportation, shops, restaurants, medical, grocers, etc. As with many places outside of the United States/Canada, bartering is a common practice here. I\u2019m no fool but I\u2019m really not the type to barter so I tend to go from place to place until someone gives me a price I feel is fair. Most of the time, there was no need to do this. Everyone I encountered gave me what I thought was a \u201cgood deal\u201d. Cancun, however, is another story. There was no bartering and you can expect to pay prices you\u2019d find in New York or San Francisco \u2013 very expensive! Transportation: Since this was my first time to Mexico and despite all the glowing reviews, I didn\u2019t feel comfortable taking public transportation so I considered both renting a car as well as private transportation. After much research on car rentals, I decided against it. This is due to the crooked police and the very high mandatory \u201cMexican\u201d Insurance. Instead, I opted for private transportation via Cancun Shuttle. For a private ride from the airport to Playa Del Carmen, Playa Del Carmen to Cancun Hotel Zone and Cancun Hotel Zone to the airport, the cost was about $175.00. After getting to the resort, talking to other travelers and experiencing the public bus myself, I can confirm its value and safety. Their public transportation system covers the entire country, is very inexpensive and is much nicer than anywhere else I\u2019ve been. If you\u2019re just 1 or 2 people, save yourself tons of money by paying just $7 per person for public transportation! For larger groups, a private shuttle makes the most sense. Resort: The resort is beautiful - situated in a tropical/wild environment with all the comfort, amenities and service you would expect from an Iberostar resort. For those unfamiliar, once you stay at one you\u2019ll likely fall in love with the brand. They really have 2 class levels which I would consider 3.5-5 star properties in the lower end and 5+ star properties in the upper end (Grand Iberostars). This one is the lower end most likely because of the food quality, level of amenities and personalized service. I typically don\u2019t like the really high end resorts because they are too \u201csnobby\u201d for me. When I\u2019m on vacation I am not interested in wearing a suit and tie to dinner nor do I need a butler on command. With that said, unless you\u2019re expectations are in line with services offered by Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental, St. Regis or Intercontinental, you\u2019ll love this place! The tropical/jungle environment was an unexpected but spectacular surprise! You\u2019ll find wild monkeys, Iguanas, Pink Flamingos, Swans and Tropical Birds roaming throughout the property. I assume they must be contained somehow because I never saw any mishaps with any of the wild animals but I also never noticed any sort of fence or cage. Rooms: I stayed in a regular room, an ocean view junior suite as well as the Presidential Suite during my stay. Although I'm never in the room much when traveling to tropical places, being ocean front is important to me so after the first night and realizing my original booking had a view of the trees, I called the front desk and upgraded to a Junior Suite. It was basically the same room with an extra bench and table but had spectacular views of the ocean! The cost for the upgrade was about $75 per night. Both of these room types were very comfortable. There are no extra outlets in any of the rooms, unless you want to unplug a lamp or the TV. The 3rd day, while in the lobby using the internet ($5 for 15 minutes), I noticed a sign offering a Special Upgrade Price for the Presidential Suite. It ended up being $400USD for 4 nights which was in addition to my original package price and the $150 I had already paid for the 2 nights in the Junior Suite. I was a solo traveler but again, I love checking out hotels and different room types so decided to upgrade, yet again. The Presidential Suite was enormous and very nice but admittedly, below my expectations. These suites are actually Penthouses in buildings 10 and 20 and have remarkable views complete with multiple terraces/balconies and Jacuzzis. It had 3 bedrooms and 3.5 baths, a food preparation area, living room, parlor, and multiple closets and sitting areas. Bedroom #1 had 1 Queen Sized Bed, #2 had 2 Doubles and #3, the Master Suite, had a California King. Each room had its own sliding glass doors to the terrace and bathroom. The reason I was a little disappointed with the Presidential Suite is because I expected it to be more modern and include some extra \u201cperks\u201d, such as liquor service, stocked food/snacks and perhaps an internet connection. This was not the case \u2013 I even called the front desk and asked. Since the suite was so large, I wanted to invite some people I met back for a drink once the disco closed at 3AM but ended up having to pay $25 for small, off-brand bottle of vodka. Keep in mind the suites are at the other end of the resort so are a good 15 minute walk from either main lobby and all of the night time entertainment areas. This shouldn\u2019t be an issue for most people, especially because walking throughout the resort at night is very magical somehow. Room Tip: Only Buildings 10 and 20 are \u201cocean front\u201d. If you want to avoid any upgrade costs, you can try for a limited \u201cocean view\u201d room by asking to be placed in buildings 11 or 21! I only counted about 6-8 rooms that may have a very limited view of the ocean in either of these buildings. There is also no option to have a \u201cpool view\u201d room. The resort just isn\u2019t setup this way which I can appreciate because of all the trees, privacy and tropical environment. I kept all of the check-in documents I received including a list of activities, schedules, places to eat, disco and room service info, a map, etc. I uploaded images to Trip Advisor but they are pretty distorted so for higher resolution images, contact me. Please include your e-mail address if contacting me via Trip Advisor so I can send them to you! Beach/Pool: The beach is great! When I sent pictures to my friends back in the states, they thought I was sending them a post card! The water is gorgeous, sand is soft and the beach is super clean! There is one large main pool which I found to be pretty deep. I couldn\u2019t comfortable stand or walk around but I\u2019m only 5\u20194\u201d. There is also a smaller \u201cactivity\u201d pool where they play games and water sports as well as a \u201ckiddie\u201d pool and an \u201cadults only\u201d pool which had the swim up bar. I found this arrangement kind of bizarre simply because I like to have drinks at a swim up bar but often felt disconnected from the rest of the resort. Activities: There are endless activities throughout the day for all ages. You can take dance lessons, do pottery, paint, learn how to scuba dive or take Spanish lessons. All are included in the price! Nightlife: I love nightlife, clubbing and dancing the night away and have been to clubs all over. I found the discoth\u00e8que to be phenomenal for an all-inclusive resort. They played great music, had wonderful drinks and was very high tech. Conclusion: I highly recommend this property! You won\u2019t be disappointed! This place is truly perfect for all traveling types \u2013 solo, couples, families or groups. One caveat might be the typical Spring Breaker simply because I don\u2019t think they allow that. Please contact me if you have any questions! Again, I have copies of everything they give you upon check in as well as tons more pictures available on my blog.

We stayed on the Quetzal side and enjoyed our stay very much. We stayed in building 25 and found that there is a male peacock that always stays by this building. The bird made a lot of noise over night & very early in the morning. When we complained about it, the front desk said no one had \"ever\" complained about it. Yeah, right! The room was very nice, except beds are hard, but ask for the egg carton mattress cover and it helps a little bit. Bathrooms are nice, large showers, with bath gel on a wall dispenser. We left the maid a small tip each day, & she always made sure we had plenty of water and beers. The buffet restuarant (only one) was always good, with lots of variety. Was hard to get a reservation at the a la carte's but we managed to get two reservations. Mexican resturant was very good & had a great \"serve yourself\" appetizer/dessert bar. Japonese was good, but was very hot sitting by the cooking table. Our chef was just learning all the good tricks and the table next to us was wowed by their chef. Food was good, but a little too much soy sauce on all the meats and rice. Dessert was just so-so. Beach area is beautiful, and we were able to get a palapa each day, but did notice that people leave their stuff to reserve it and they say that it is strictly not allowed. The grill by the beach was great, with fresh grilled hamburgers, hot dogs, grilled onions, nachos and ice cream. Also, I recommend you tip the bartenders a little here and there and if you want a stiffer drink, they'll do it. We had to walk to the beach bar to get our drinks because they just don't have enough wait staff to handle it.

In short..it is an amzing place! I have travelled around Mexico before, backpacking it but decided to check out an all inclusive hotel this time. You seriously cannot fault this place, people, service or food and drink. It is really top notch and you feel utterly welcome every day. Every single staff member whatever they do, will greet you with a smile. The complex (which is HUGE btw) is always squeaky clean and always someone on standby (without annoying or bothering you) to help with whatever your heart fancies. So enough gushing about the hotel. Food - Cannot fault. There are 2 buffet restaurants and the amount of food spreads there, is enough to keep anyone happy. Japanese resturant - Great fun entertaining evening with good food but entertainment was best! Italian restaurant - Great tasting food, I had veal (yes I know..baby moo moo..but it looked too nice to pass up) and it was great. Appetizers and breads were great too. And only restaurant who serves icy properly chilled white wine. A treat after walking in the hot evening to your restaurant. Mexican restaurant - I had the red snapper which was out of this world! My partner had the beef taco but admitted that it wasn't great, dry and no imagination. But there are tons of other stuff to try. Steakhouse restaurant - Probably the favourite amongst most guests. The one that people keep coming back to and rebooking. The Tenderloin..wow..it is GOOD! Try it and you will not be let down. Then there is a beach buffet style lunch restaurant as well which is a smaller version of the other buffet bit inside hotel. Right on beach and very handy should you have kids or just too hot to mooch back to hotel (I did mention that it is BIG hotel). Entertainment gets 5 stars for effort and 3 for quality. Some shows are great and some are tad tacky and silly. But you won't care..cus they get the atmosphere going with their energy (the staff work 14 hour days I think, 6 days/week). what else - well we only did two trips as I had been around before. One to beautiful Tulum and the other to Coba. Coba was a new thing for me, glad I went but wouldn't go again. Very hot jungle walking which made it worthwhile when reaching pyramid with 120 steps and the great feeling when your finally down again lol! They have a disco'Mascara' which we didn't go to the 1st week but after meeting more and more people, we got dragged along - and it IS fun! And very air conditioned as well :-) Hotel room was very nice and the cleaners do an amazing job + cute little towel animal every day. You get refills of bottled water, soft drinks + bottled beers. More than enough to keep you smiling. Beach is very very clean and if you keep to the left at the beach, you still get the service but it's not too packed.

They all claim the same thing too: \"we aren't picky travelers but...[insert every picky complaint here]\". The service/staff, beach, rooms, food, etc were absolutely perfect and we'd stay there again in a heart beat. We were waiting to find a catch to our perfect vacation but it never came. We didn't travel with kids but it definitely seems like a family friendly resort. They had lots of activities throughout the day, the Star Friends staff would initiate things like limbo, zumba, football games, bingo, etc. There was free snorkling, scuba lessons and kayaking if you didn't want to pay for any excursions. Here are a list of the top complaints that I will debunk for you: 1). You can't get a lounge chair/crowded beach- FALSE! No matter what time of day we went to the beach or pool area, we always saw open lounge chairs. The only thing that tends to fill up is the little cabana things. But we went to the beach and pool at different times every day, and i'd say 80% of the time we were able to get some shade if we wanted it under a cabana, and a good spot. The pool water for the main pool was too warm for the most part, but that's when we just opted to swim in the ocean instead. The swim up bar pool was perfect and there were always seats down there! 2). The food is terrible- FALSE! There are 4 restaurants that are reservation only (only the outdoor restaurants dont have air conditioning). We got guarenteed reservations at 2 of them but here's a trick if you'd like to eat at more than what you're alotted: call the reservations desk after 4pm as they get cancellations throughout the day. We were able to eat at the Mexican themed restaurant one night using this method. Also, the wait staff told us that sometimes people no show their reservations and if you just stop by the restaurant, they can possibly get you in. We were able to eat at 3 out of the 4 restaurants during our stay and felt that there were almost too many food options, all delicious. The Hibachi and Texas themed restaurants were our favorites. Keep in mind you are traveling to a foreign country. This food isn't going to taste like American food does. As long as you have an open mind and don't have stuck up expectations, you'll be fine. The buffetts do change but have some main staples (pizza, burgers, fruit, etc) that area always there. 3). The staff isn't friendly- FALSE! I seriously cannot fathom why anyone would feel this way. To say these people would go above and beyond would be an understatement. There was always someone there ready to refill your drink at all the restaurants/buffets and they never acted pushy like they were expecting a tip. Room service was always quick with our order when we got it. We left the maid a $2 tip with a note daily, and she always gave us extra waters and beer. Even when we left the resort to walk around the local area (there is a starbucks with free wifi and a few shops/convenience stores 5 minutes down the street) even the local people were friendly! Everyone makes eye contact and says hola. They really take care of the tourists down there and do a good job of making you feel comfortable/safe. 4). The rooms aren't nice- FALSE! The shower is huge and has 2 shower heads and the beds aren't horribly uncomfortable like some of the reviews say. I'm sorry princesses but if you want a fluffy cloud to sleep on maybe you should book something more expensive and higher end. You can't pay for a Ford and expect a Ferarri. Our king sized bed was just fine for us. Plenty of room to roll around and we slept like babies. Most TV stations are in Spanish but you will find some English stations. Stations are limited. But who wants to sit in a hotel room and watch TV when you're on vacation anyways? I couldn't believe people were complaining about that! 5). The drinks aren't good- FALSE! Keep in mind if you are in an all inclusive package, you can ask for extra alcohol in your drinks. You aren't going to get charged for this. Also, on the Iberostar Tucan side (which you'll have access to), brand name liquor such as Jack Daniels, Skyy Vodka, etc. is included!", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, Texas", "Title": "\u201cToo many rules and restrictions!\u201d", "Author": "scmorganTX", "ReviewID": "UR114588781", "Content": "The Iberostar Quetzal is about an hour's drive from the Cancun airport and sits on a beautiful beach with gorgeous turquoise water. And that's pretty much where things go downhill. Let me say that we came into this with an open mind after reading the reviews posted here. We read the good and the bad and thought the bad reviews must have just been overly picky travelers. Not so, my fellow trip advisors. Not so. In brief: Decent rooms, decent staff, decent hotel grounds, AWFUL food (cannot overstate this point), air conditioning only in your room (not in lobby bars, theater, or restaurants), crappy beach chairs, noisy and annoying pool area, stupid rules about towels, and HOT, disgusting pool water. First of all, there is no A/C anywhere in the resort except your room. The lobby, the theater, the buffets, the steak house -- none of it is air conditioned, which makes for a hot and sweaty breakfast, lunch, and dinner, especially after a long walk from one building to another, as the resort is spread out across a large area. It's possible that the Japanese or the Italian restaurants are air conditioned, but I wouldn't know because we were only allowed ONE reservation for the restaurants because we only stayed for three nights. So for two night we were relegated to the AWFUL buffets. I don't know how that sludge passes as food. The only way it could have been worse is if they were actually serving piles of regurgitated cat vomit. I tried a tiny bit of almost everything in hopes of finding something edible and this was my conclusion: The tacos al pastor from room service were edible. The hot dogs and hamburgers were barely edible. Otherwise, stick to the fruit and plain vegetables and the bread and ice cream. Everything else was just horrid. It's true that we like good food (who doesn't) and will spend money on a nice dinner out, but we are also fine with fast food or chain restaurants, so I don't consider ourselves to be extremely picky eaters, but this was just ridiculous. We, like another trip advisor reviewer, ended up taking a taxi and getting dinner outside of the resort for our last night as I just couldn't take it any longer. The rooms are fine. Nothing too fancy, but they are large enough and clean. The bathroom was actually pretty nice with a nicely tiled stand-up shower. The rest of the room is what I would call \"traditional tropical\" -- orange and yellow walls with bright floral printed textiles. The bed was hard as a rock, but I think this is normal in Mexico, based on our last trip (to a different resort) and friend's trips as well. But be prepared for a rock-hard mattress and, potentially, a stiff neck in the morning. Here's where the rules start. You aren't allowed to bring your all-inclusive alcoholic drinks or food up to your room with you. There is a mini-bar, but it only contains waters, sodas, and a couple of beers. You can order room service, but there are no alcoholic beverages available there either. OK, so if you want a drink, you have it on the beach or by the pool. Fine. Stupid rule number two: The towels. You have these little cards that you trade in for towels. One towel per person. The towel place closes at a certain time... I think it was 7. You can't get a new beach towel after that point. When we arrived at the hotel on our first night, we were starving, so headed for the buffet first thing. We thought we would at least have time for a quick swim before we turned in for the evening, but because of the towel rule, this was not possible. A major disappointment considering it was already a short trip. Also, speaking of hours -- there were so many different hours at different restaurants and buffets that we couldn't keep it all straight, and it didn't seem like they adhered to their own hours very well, either. So unless you bring your day planner and take notes when the guy at the reception desk gives you the quick rundown of times, expect to be confused. Finally -- the beach. I mean, this is why we are all coming here, anyway, right? This saved our trip from being a complete waste. It is a lovely beach. I would avoid the pool area, as that is where they have all the \"activities\" going down all day -- loud music, obnoxious MCs playing party games and such -- and just sit by the beach. Yes, it's true that you have to get there pretty early to get one of the palapas with the covered beach chairs, but they will let you borrow an umbrella and set it up yourself, which we did and were fine with. There were a lot of motorized boats and jet skis that stunk up one side of the beach with a gasoline smell, but it wasn't that bad, especially if you set up on the other side. I did not enjoy the beach chairs, however. Several of them were broken and because they were plastic, the backs kept popping up every time you move. The ones by the pool were much nicer. They do include sail boats and kayaks at no extra cost, and they had free trial scuba sessions in the pool, which was cool. They also offered an inexpensive and really nice snorkel trip that was only a couple of hours for about $40 U.S. Much better than spending a whole day taking a bus or a boat way out to snorkel.

We chose the Quetzal after weeks of intensive research & picked it due to the good TA reviews & it's setting near to Playa del Carmen, on th Mayan riviera. Much like so many other TA reviewers we had a wonderful time with just a few tiny gripes (mostly caused by Thomas Cook!) which in no way spoiled a delightful holiday. I'll try & make my review as comprehensive as possible. Flights were sadly lacking, particularly on the return journey. I won't bang on about the lack of quality from Thomas Cook airlines (as I've done that on multiple airline review sites) but let's just say that badly timed transfers, unmanned check in desks, poor service, bad food, uncomfortable seats (with no tray or armrest) TV's that don't work & unhelpful flight attendants do not create happy customers. Never again, & I'd recommend that you avoid flying with TC if you possibly can. Cancun airport was not quite as bad as expected, bit of a scramble & none of the organised queueing that us Brits are used to :) We were in & out in about an hour & a half. However we did hear some horror stories (one guy at our resort said he'd been at the airport for 4 hours!) so be prepared. Our transfer time both ways was about an hour & a half. TIP: You are given an immigration form on the plane, make sure you keep the second part for departure or you'll have delays trying to leave. You'll also need departure tax of 660pesos or \u00a338, this is cash only & they will NOT accept US dollars, again, make doubly sure that you have this otherwise you'll get stuck at departures. Environment: The hotel is actually 2 hotels Quetzal & Tucan. From what we could see they're identical & share all facilities, I guess they've split them into 2 hotels because the complex is absolutely massive & 1 reception/lobby wouldn't be able to cope with all the guests when the hotel is full, a good idea as it means there are never too many queues. Apart from check in/out, which has to be done at \"your\" hotel, you can use all the facilities (bars, shops, exchange, guest services) at either lobby. Fortunately the complex was nowhere near full when we were there (I'd guess about 60%) solving any overcrowding problems. They closed 1 buffet restaurant & the tropical, speciality restaurant also wasn't open, not an issue for us but be warned they might reduce amenities when it's not full. If anyone else is like us & likes the luxury of a large resort without the overcrowding I can recommend the last 2 weeks in May, no spring breakers, minimal kids but still enough people to create an atmosphere. The grounds are beautifully kept (especially considering the amount oif critters around!) & the jungle setting makes for a really exciting feel. There is always something new (& cute) to look at & it's wonderful the first time you hear the monkeys! There is plenty of wildlife to enjoy, it makes for a really special holiday & something very different, but please bear in mind that the animals ARE wild. There are signs everywhere politely asking you not to feed the animals, please respect this, what seems to be a great holiday moment for you may end up leading to a nasty incident further down the line & result in someone else getting hurt by an overexcited wild animal. The accommodation blocks run down either side of the resort with the jungle area in the middle so you can use the outside paths or take the slightly wilder, but quicker, route through the jungle. TIP: Girls, the jungle paths are very uneven so if you're wearing heels or wedges take the long way round the outside where the paths are level. We giggled at quite a few tottering females in stacked heels! TIP: There are no fences seperating you from the jungle & there are quite a few pretty steep drop offs so keep an eye on wandering kids! Pools & Beach: The main pool is lovely, a great size & depth (at 5'8\" I just about kept my head above water) The water was kind of warm but still cool enough to be refreshing. There's an games end of the pool (the shallow end by the beach) which is where the starfriends do all the pool games & play music & there's a big jacuzzi in the middle. There's also an activity pool for serious swimmers & the more energetic ball games & a swim up bar (adults only)which looked like good fun but was a bit....shall we say....messy by about 5pm! (most people seemed to stay in there all day!) there's waitress service by the pool & a snack bar, along with some yummy ice cream. TIP: The kids pool, when we dipped our feet in, was absolutely boiling hot, at least bath temperature. I'd recommend using the shallow end of the big pool & watching kids carefully, rather than put them in there to broil! The beach is beautiful with the white sand & the kind of azure sea I thought only existed in postcards. The sea was pretty rough with big waves the first week we were there, great fun for us but not so good for the little ones. We had no trouble getting chairs by the beach or pool but if you do miss out on a hut they do beach umbrellas at the towlel hut .We spent more time at the beach because it was so beautiful & relaxing, with a lovely atmosphere. Our Room: We emailed the resort (twice) in advance with a few requests & a restaurant booking, they either didn't get it or ignored it. I wasn't too surpriesed as there seems to be about a 50/50 success rate when people do this. They're quite willing to move you if space is available but I was happy with the room we got so didn't bother asking. We were on the second floor of block 24 which actually turned out perfect as it's exactly halfway between the restaurants/bars & the beach/pools. The bed was decorated with rose petals & kissing swan towel animals & we also got a fruit basket, bottle of tequila & iberostar t shirts as it was a honeymoon trip, a realy nice touch. The room was a good size,(though might be cramped for a family sharing) with some nice touches, particularly the iron & board & the coffee maker. TIP: The tea & coffee provided in the rooms is foul! Better to buy some in PDC & use the coffee machine as a kettle :) The bathroom was a lovely size with a big double shower (no bath) & a large sink area for all your bits & pieces. They provide shampoo, shower gel, flannels & a few other bits. There were a good amount of English channels on the TV & we were amused to discover that the UK is not the only place that shows Friends 8 times a day! My husband was chuffed with all the sports channels & even watched the champions league final in our room. The balcony was pleasant enough & had a handy little drying rack on it. The aircon was effective & not too noisy, as was the fridge/minibar which is restocked daily. The bed was massive & we actually found it really comfortable. I thought we'd got the mattress topper I requested in my email & when I discovered that we didn't I couldn't work out what all the complaints were about! We found the bed firm rather than hard so unless you're used to a REALLY soft bed you should be fine. Maid service was excellent but timing was a bit hit & miss though they'll try & work round you where possible. They are very efficient, the room was spotless after every time she did it & she even flagged up a fault & got it fixed without us even saying anything (it was a problem with the sink that wasn't bothering us at all). Overall I found the room a lovely place to be, no noise from either side but you can hear people coming back from the disco/entertainment so be considerate if you're having a late night! TIP: There are no lifts so those with pushchairs, wheelchairs or movement difficulties will need to request a ground floor room. Food & Drink: There is a buffet restaurant for each side of the resort. We only went in Tucan once as they closed it a few days after we arrived, we preferred Quetzal side as the setting was nicer but the food appeared to be the same in both. Please don't listen to the gripes about the buffet food, we found it marvellous. I guess the complainers expect the resort to give each person a private chef to cook them exactly what they want, exactly how & when they want it. Well if they did that none of us could afford to stay there! The selection was mind boggling, from basic hot dogs, chips & burgers, a different carvery every night (best beef ever!) through to mexican specialities, a variety of meat & fish dishes, fresh salad, pasta & rice & more. You could easily go 2 weeks & not eat the same thing twice. The puddings were also delicious, with a great selection something that's very unusual for an AI. Breakfast was awesome, forget the Full english, it's all about the full Mexican! Fried mozzarella sticks, for breakfast? I was in heaven! The white wine provided with meals was nice but my husband wasn't keen on the red. There are 5 speciality restaurants.We only tried the Mexican & Steakhouse & found them both a little disappointing. The promised array of cured meats & fish for starter were not available in the steakhouse, only shellfish, which was a shame. The fillet I had was fine, if a bit overcooked for med rare but my husbands BBQ ribs were very mean. Also the accompaniment to the food (baked potato & corn on the cob) were dry & tough as they'd been pre-cooked & sitting on a hotplate for quite some time. We enjoyed the mexican a little more, my husband really enjoyed his flaming kebabs (Flambe'd at the table!) & the chicken I had was just ok. I know others have given both these restaurants glowing reviews so maybe we just went on a bad day. No great loss as we were loving the buffet anyway. The wine in the speciality restaurants was not as good as the buffet as I think they want you to buy from their \"wine list\" bit cheeky, we thought. TIP: The steakhouse & tropical restaurants allow smart shorts but long trousers MUST be worn at the other speciality restaurants & beachwear is not allowed in the main buffets, (though they're fine if you cover up with a sarong/t shirt/beach dress) Apart from the main buffet restaurants there's a smaller buffet in what is the tropical restaurant by night. This is right next to the pool & does a nice selection, there's also a great little grill next to this by the beach that does nachos, dogs, burgers & potato wedges, very yummy! Make good use of the beach ice cream bar too, you won't regret it, absolutely delicious. There are 5 bars but the beach & pool bars shut at night leaving only the 2 lobby bars & the theatre bar where all the entertainment is. We mostly used the lobby bar which was nicer & less crowded. Try the frozen margaritas! All bars are shut by 12.30pm so if you want to drink after that you have to go into the disco. Entertainment & activities We don't tend to get involved with all the games & activities but there was always something going on for all ages & abilities. The star friends are nice & not too pushy & the evening entertainment (provided by the same people, these guys work HARD!) was decent enough in the couple of shows we saw. The disco is blessedly cool & has decent enough music considering the range of nationalities/ ages they're catering to. From the dive centre on the beach you can get free kayaks, catamarans & windsurfers but you have to pay for jetskis & parasailing. they do a lot of snorkelling/scuba diving excursions & there are free scuba lessons in the pool twice a day. We also had a massage in the spa which was lovely. We did excursions to Xplor & Chichen itza & I've reviewed them on their own pages. I'd absolutely recommend Xplor, it was a great day out & we loved it. I'd recommend Chichen Itza too, you can't go all that way & not see the wonder of the world! TIP: Don't be fooled into getting the rep based trip to Xplor, it's only 10 mins away by cab & you can do it quicker & cheaper on your own.(book tickets online in advance to avoid queues)we spent a miserable, pointless hour on a coach & wished we hadn't bothered! We did a couple of evening trips to Playa del Carmen (about 5 mins by cab) & found it a lovely place to visit, very safe with a great atmosphere & the vendors are not too pushy & happy to haggle. There are a lot of bars & restaurants & several million mariachi! There's also a HSBC bank & a couple of Santanders & you'll get a better exchange rate from any of the booths here than you will at the resort. We had an absolutely excellent meal at Sud restaurant (on 5th ave, just past 12th) for our anniversary. Food & service were both top drawer (as was the very expensive tequila our waiter talked us into!) It was a special night & I'd thoroughly recommend walking past the other cheaper places to eat here. It was delicious! Overall: A great holiday, in a great resort. I'd come back in a heartbeat. On our last day the guy that picked us & our cases up said \"are you ready to go home then?\" We looked at each other sadly & I said \"No I could do at least a few more weeks\". He laughed,but I meant it! Definitely my best hoilday so far, everywhere else has a lot to live up to now.

I son't want to be too hard on the Iberostar but the comparison does not leave me thinking that this is a 5 star hotel. The troubling things here are not going to be a concern to everyone to the same extent. First, check in made me wait from about noon, when we arrived to 3 pm to get into a room and then they didn't bother asking if we wanted a King bed so I ended up with two doubles. Second was availability of dining. They guarantee you one night in one of their 5 specialty restaurants if you are only there for a few days. That goes to 2 days if you are a guest for a week.. We found that we couldn't ask about availability for the first night until 4 pm and when we hit that desk at 4:10 the sign was already out that nothing was available for that night. When we asked about the next day, we could only choose from the Mexican restaurant or nothing. For the third night we could choose from a few but we were told that the steak house was booked until Saturday. Here we were standing at the desk on Sunday and they are telling us that we can't reserve the steak house because it is booked up until the following Saturday. We made a reservation for the Japanese restaurant but then my wife went to the front desk and complained. That resulted in their giving us a reservation at the steak house for the third night but substituting that for our original reservation. The Steak House was open air, not particularly fancy but the food and service were certainly good. The interesting part was that while we were there half the restaurant was empty. So, if you don't mind doing buffet three times a day this sort of stuff shouldn't bother you... and when you go to the buffet restaurant you will be making many stops to take pictures. You'll find flamingos, monkey (noisy but much less visible), swans, other bird, artificial waterfalls and all sorts of other birds including peacocks and ducks. Rooms a bit on the smaller side, especially when compared to the NOW hotel, which, by the way does not have a reservation system for its specialty restaurants. You just go and if they are filled, you get a beeper and come back, usually with a drink in hand.The Iberostar charges about $3.50 for a quarter hour of internet access with you own computer. That was one of the better benefits of the preferred level at NOW where it was free for that level.I should mention that the buffet at the Iberostar is quite good .... something for everyone and well prepared.Great yogurt in the morning, etc., etc. Service tends to be on the light side with waiters and waitresses paying more attention to your possible needs once the word isout that you tip. The towel system at the pool was one that uses a card that you trade for the rather thin towel. Again, a marked difference to the AMResorts where you don't use a wrist band and don't have to worry about leaving you towel behind. And NOW uses a really big fluffy towel and you just get whatever you need.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edwardsville, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cAMAZING\u201d", "Author": "ARocca", "ReviewID": "UR112615145", "Content": "This place is amazing in every aspect!

Everyone was so friendly and gracious! They were there for you at every turn! We never had a hard time finding a chair. We went to the pool at different times all week and always found one that was suitable. The pool is shared by both the Tucan and Quetzal side but it is plenty big. I loved how there was only music on one side of the pool so that if you did want to just relax you had a retreat. We did not bring our kids and found the side without the music had less children plus the water was deeper on that side. I do have to say the swim up bar pool was less desirable. It just didn't look clean though I did see them cleaning it just didn't look appealing. We did not go there. By the pool there were always servers walking around getting drinks...very nice. The wildlife was amazing! It was like staying in a luxury jungle. Warning the peacocks do wake up around 6:30am and sound like very loud cats meowing but it didn't really bother us. Drinks were good and if there was not enough alcohol you could just ask for more. It never seemed to be a problem for us. Ice was scarce in the drinks but again just ask for more. The refrigerator in the room is not very cold but that was easily solved by getting ice in your bucket. We didn't really spend a ton of time in our room so this was no biggie. The bed was hard but don't let that be deciding factor as everyone I spoke to from other resorts said the same thing. The beach had a ton of chairs and if you couldn't get there early enough to score a hut the towel bar had umbrellas you could take down to the beach. The entertainment (shows) were cheesy but entertaining. Go a little early if you want a good seat as these shows fill up every night. Town is a short taxi ride from the hotelandTaxis were never a shortage. The maids were amazing. A couple of days we knew we would be in and out of the room all day and put the Do Not Disturb sign on the door. They would call and make sure we didn't need anything. They would ask us in the hall if we were sure we didn't want our room clean. They were always there also! Whatever we needed. They did a fantastic job! We never really got bored with the food. There was always a pretty good variety on all the buffets. We ate at the Japanese steak house and the Mexican both were good. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.

We had a large group of family and friends ranging in age from 20 - 75 and everyone had a great time. My first compliment goes to Alberto and Hugo from Loomas Travel as they both went above and beyond the call of duty. I left Chicago with the beginning signs of an allergic reaction. By the tme I reached the hotel I was in need of a hospital and Alberto and Hugo sprung into action. They got me and my husband to the hospital only 5 minutes away and Hugo stayed with us until several hours later when I released. The staff at the clinic were extremely professional and efficient and after IVs of antihistamine, antiinflammatories and antibiotics, I was good to return to the hotel. They even took care of filling my prescription! They checked daily on my progress and were very kind and concerned. This was my 3rd trip to the Cancun area and we have previously stayed at the Bahia Principe and the Sandos Playcar. I had read the reviews and I agree that the beds were hard....easily fixed by requesting a crate which we did. The wildlife was extraordinary and really separates this hotels from the others. Our room was 2646 which faced the jungle and we were amused daily by the monkeys, peacocks and lizards. Our rooms were clean and didn't smell musty which I did experience at the Sandos. We were at the beach as well as the pool daily and never had any trouble finding chairs regardless of when we arrive. The beach was cleaned daily and was awesome. Waiters brought drinks to your chair at both the pool and beach. The staff was great and we kept the bartendars busy with our group. The food at the main buffet was good and there was a large selection, but I preferred the smaller snack bar which faced the ocean and always had a wonderful ocean breeze. We thought the burgers grilled outside were great! We also ate at the Japanese (the best and most entertaining), the Italian and the Mexican which all accomodated our large group and were good. This hotel was only a 5 minute walk from the Playacar market and a 30 minute walk to Playa del Carmen. We visted the Playacar market several times and also walked to Playa del Carmen which was a $7 cab fare. We throughly enjoyed our stay at the Quetzal and sing its praises!

The first room they gave us was in building 28 but we asked for a room closer to the beach and in a upper floor and the girl at the front desk immediately agreed to our request and gave us a room in building 21, second floor.

The water was very warm and the waves were low. FOOD - The food was very good (but not so good as in Iberostar Bavaro in Punta Cana). There's always someting different to eat every day meat, fish lots of salads, mexican food, very good fruit, ice creams, and juices. We took our breakfast and dinner at the main buffet and lunch in the buffet by the beach. We wento to the Mexican, and the Japonese (the best).

It didnt matter what time we got to the pool or the beach, there were plenty of beds to choose from. If you go onto the beach and cannot get a bed under a palapa, you can get a parasol from the towel hut. The waitresses around the pool are fantastic, they are around all day and ask you regularly if you need a top up. There is a swim up bar but we did not try it out.

We thought we could go to different bars every night - not the case, unless you go into town. Which you should do, very entertaining if not pricey for drinks. The scenery and beach set up is amazing.

My favourite part of the day would be watching the evening shows they were soo good i have never been to a hotel that as but on this standerd of entertainment every night you realy must go and see them my favourite show was boggie nights . The food was nice and the steack house and itilian were my favourite and again the staff could not do enough to help you.

Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!\u201d", "Author": "Teece88", "ReviewID": "UR108660349", "Content": "Great hotel! I reviewed this under the Tucan , but as they are joined / share facilities I thought it apt for anyone looking up the Quetzal too. Firstly, the service was wonderful, the staff are so helpful and friendly and efficient. They were generaly good at English / multilingual, which was nice. This was our first stay at this hotel, and first trip to Mexico. We booked it very last-minute, and were on the plane a little over 24hrs later! It was mainly chosen on the strength of the good percentage it got on TripAdvisor, and it didn't dissapoint! In fact, I would say it was quite possibly my best holiday ever, and that was no mean feat to cheer us up as one of the reasons we went away was because we had had such a rough few weeks personally beforehand. The Hotel is located in a great place, right on a beautiful beach...picture postcard perfect white sand and lovely clear blue sparkly water. The drinks waitresses even trek around the beach to ask if you want drinks and deliver them direct to your lounger, not just around the pool. A location review simply cannot be complete without mentioning one of the best things we loved about the place.... the jungle setting and the animals! (Another reason we picked it) - It was great to see and be on the lookout for the monkeys, turtles, peacocks, koi carp, parrots, toucans, tortoises,flamingoes, swans and various other birds, lizards etc... yet also see ones I had never seen before such as an Agouti. The Tucan is joined on too, and you can use the facilities. The show area/pools are used by both, and even if you think it is a direct copy of the Quetzal side, its worth a visit through as they have the slightly different animal types in the two places, eg) turtle pool, the flamingo pool etc... It is within the Playacar resort /road so feels nice and secure. Both within and out of the resort we didnt really get that sense of being hassled to death from shopkeepers / sellers etc.. that you get in a lot of holiday resorts which was great, they enquired a bit but were happy to leave you alone if you didnt require them, that was nice. There are a few little shops on site but there is a shopping centre down the road within walking distance with a Starbucks too, or a short taxi ride will take you to the main shopping area '5th Avenue' which is much bigger and more varied but more bustling and street entertainers etc... Yet you still feel very safe as a tourist which was good! Reception will summon a taxi for you and as with pretty much everything else, it is there almost instantly as you ask for it! There are also nearby attractions such as Xcaret, X-Plor (an adventure park where you can do rafting in underground rivers, zip wires above the trees, cave swimming, off-road vehicles etc... worth a look!) and also trips to cultural areas of Mayan ruins etc... There is a nice breeze on the beach so makes sunbathing and beach games more bearable if you find the weather too hot. The weather was good every day. The sea is pleasantly warm, as is the pool, but also refreshing. I went to a hotel last year where the pool was so so cold barely anyone could bear to go in it, even the kids, so this was a welcome change. Another good factor was that despite it being a large hotel, we never struggled to get sun loungers , no matter what time of day we went out to sunbathe. There are plenty of shaded umbrellas fixed round the pool and on the beach but if these were all taken and you didnt want any of the ones in the direct sun you could get large parasols free from the towel exchange to take onto the beach to use. The entertainment was fine, the animation team work long and hard, and put in lots of effort, with prefessional dancers / singers and games / competitions etc... and try to cater for all ages and in a few different languages. Very welcoming and funny team without being over intrusive / overbearing. Big hats-off to them, they made the holiday! If there is a Magic Show on if you go...go see it! It was really really good! There is a nightclub on site but we never went so have no idea what it was like. We do not have children ourselves but it was obvious to see that the kids were very well catered for here. They had a dedicated member who was entertaining them, and they could join in with most of the pool/beach games etc.. and they even had their own miniature tables and chairs set out at the front of the hall where the shows are. There were nice little activities going on during the day, usual stuff as water or beach volleyball, water polo/basketball, archery, aqua aerobics, funny pool games with prizes etc... yet also extra little things such as dancing lessons, cariacature artist, (get it done if you get the chance..very funny results, I still laugh every time I see ours!), clown / balloon modeller, spanish lessons, bingo, henna tattoos, pottery painting, daytime beach party/bbq with bucking bronco games etc... A 70 year old man had a go when we were there...and won! Did himself proud! For the sportier side you have the usual stuff like tennis courts, gym, football, ping pong tables, pool tables, free scuba lessons in the pool, watersports - kayak, catamaran etc.. and even mountain bikes and they do a twice-daily bike ride with you if you want to explore out a bit. There are things like Jetskis and Parasailing etc.. available from the beach for a charge too. More relaxing.. there is a spa with steam room and jacuzzis (free) and other chargeable things like massages, beauty treatments, hairdresser etc... There are separate pools , so plenty for everyone - kiddies one, adult one with swim up bar that was a bit rowdier, 'event' pool which I used for swimming lengths away from the main hustle and bustle, and of course the large main pool which was plenty big enough for its purpose without getting overcrowded. There is money exchange at the hotel, which is nice as where I went last year I had trouble getting travellers cheques changed, and was for cash exchange only , but here at the Tucan they do change them so thats fine. You may get a slightly better exchange rate in the town or wherever but I dont think its all that much, probably not enought to warrant having to wander about with your passport etc... so I usually changed it in the hotel, it was easier. There are quite a few weddings going on, seems a popular place for them, and you often saw a Mexican band playing. Another lovely thing was that it was my birthday when we were out there and we booked one of the speciality restaurants one night and unexpectedly (Reception or the rep must have flagged it up to them, we definitley didnt) they sent the Mexican band over to play/sing Happy Birthday to me, and provided Tequila and a little birthday cake with a candle! The restaurants were good, there was a choice of Italian, Japanese, Mexican or Steakhouse. We didnt bother with the Japanese as neither of us are very keen on the menu, but the others were good. Steakhouse especially. Wish we could've gone more than once. Food in the general buffet was fine, with translations in several languages on cards to say what each dish was. We ate just as often in the Quetzal side as we did in the Tucan. Plenty of choice, and hot. I also saw them regularly going around testing the temperature of hot dishes etc.. which was nice and reassuring. The fresh fruit is lovely.. the pineapple the sweetest and juiciest we've ever tasted! There were also beach bars, snack bars, ice cream stands etc.. all day so never any problems for eating or drinking as much as you want /need. The room was fine, air conditioned, mini bar, safety deposit box, satellite tv, nice size and large bed, plenty chairs etc... The bed may be considered a little hard for some but I believe they will provide matress toppers if you ask. It was kept very clean, and the maid created a wonderful towel animal for us every day. Every day I expected her to run out of ideas but there was a different one for the whole 2 weeks! When we first got there we didnt think we had much of a balcony view as we could not see the pool / beach etc...only lots of trees, but we quickly realised that we in fact, had one of the best room locations (in our opinion..) as we were right in the jungle! Not only did this make our day by regularly seeing the wildlife scuttling about, and especially the monkeys playing ,and even on our balcony, but it was also wonderfully private due to the surrounding trees. The balcony has furniture so you can sit out, and also a clothes dryer, but tie them on, just in case the monkeys are about! hehe. Sleep quality was good. Once the show finished they move off to the disco so the noise stops. There are also blackout curtains to keep the room dark and stop the early morning sun blazing in. We took earplugs, after a few past experiences of noise in hotels, but ended up not even having to take them out of the packets. You may hear the odd animal / bird sounds but you get used to it and it kinda adds to the jungle experience anyway. But generally, good. You barely even notice the usual noise of the crickets. There did not seem to be lots of rowdy guests shouting and banging about either so that was nice. The only thing I would imrove on the room would be maybe a little more storage space for clothes etc... I prefer to put all my clothes away properly rather than live out of my suitcase, so a few more drawers maybe wouldve been nice. The bathroom was nice, lots of mirrors, great shower, large, hot and powerful...never wanted to get out of it! There were 2 showerheads, 1 lower...presumably for kids? but high enough up so you could have both running for an adult too, which was a nice boost. We had the odd issue with the credit-card style room key not working, but it was soon sorted and certainly not worth really moaning about as i'm sure some people would. One item to note though.. there seemed to be no lifts though so if you have kids, a wheelchair, a disability etc... you will need a ground floor apartment. I know this is a glowing review that sounds like there was nothing awful but thats how we felt! we loved every second of it, and were literally welling up at the thought of leaving (well, I was..haha!). Missing it from the second we left, and still missing it now, and moping about. I'm one of those people who generally doesn't believe in visiting the same country twice on my holidays, much less the same resort or even hotel! but I even said I would be happy to return here. and that is only the 3rd place I have ever said that about. In fact, we have said we would like to return when we have a little one, as it was good for us a couple but it looked such a great family place too. We even wrote a letter to the manager of praise for the staff and facilities, and handed it in to reception when we checked out, first time i've done that. I have already been telling my friends about it and in fact, some of them have already decided on the strength of our recommendation that they have decided to go in the summer, and do you know what?.... I have every confidence they will love it too.

I can not even express to you how happy I am that I picked this resort to stay at!!!! I recommend this resort to everyone - it is family friendly, has entertainment for kids of all ages as well as the adults, is beautiful and is a little slice of paradise! The staff is incredible - from the waitresses and waiters to the front desk people to the entertainment staff to the room service people. I can not put into words how amazing they all were! The nightly shows are fantastic, something you shouldn't miss! Reynold was our waiter at dinner in the buffet most nights and he is amazing! If you can help it, sit where he is your server! The staff was all great, but he went above and beyond! The food is amazing! During my stay I ate at the main buffet, the pool side grill, Bonsai (the Japanese restaurant), The tropical restaurant, and La Gondola (the Italian restaurant). We also ordered room service several times. The food was always fantastic. The main buffet has something for everyone at every meal. The deep fried pineapple at breakfast is to die for - you HAVE to try it! All of the fresh fruit was great and there were so many new things to try. If I had to pick just one specialty restaurant to visit again, it would be Bonsai! The show with dinner is unreal! I think that everyone should go there!!! The room was great. We were on the 3rd floor of the 24 building. The shower is amazing! The closet was the perfect size. The bed was hard as a rock, but once we asked them to put a mattress pad on the bed it was comfortable as can be! The chamber maid was there every day and stocked our fridge daily. The balcony was my favorite place! It overlooked a great big tree that had birds in it all day long. There was also a drying rack on the balcony so we could hang towels and suits. The grounds are beyond beautiful! Luscious greenery as far as the eye can see! There are all kinds of animals roaming the grounds: peacocks, turtles, toucans, parrots, tzereque (they look like giant guinea pigs but are related to a squirrel), monkeys, lizards, all sorts of birds, coy fish, flamingos, swans, black bellied whistling ducks (and they really do whistle), and even a coatimundi! It was like staying in a zoo for a week! The ponds, streams and waterfall on the grounds just add to the feeling of paradise. The pools are fantastic! The main pool is warm and gigantic! Although it is almost impossible to get a chair by the pool unless you go down before 8 a.m. There are also big covered huts that are ideal for families with small children, but, again, are almost impossible to get unless you are up at 7 a.m. Use a towel or a cheap pair of shoes ( just in case they walk away on someone else's feet) to reserve a chair and it is almost always there waiting for you. The biggest frustration is that the chairs around the pool are 80% towels and 20% people. I spent 3 full days poolside and I saw many chairs that never had a person in them, just a towel and magazine reserving them for someone.... The adult only pool with the swim up bar is a hidden treasure! It is a must see for everyone over 18! We booked our excursions through Lomas Travel and our representatives at the hotel were so helpful! Renan and Sergio had answers to all of our questions and walked us through all of our excursions, step by step! The resort is a 5 minute walk from Plaza Playacar - a fantastic little shopping center. It is a very safe area and the walk is well worth it! There is a Starbucks with free Wifi here for those of you that are going to bring technological gadgets. :) It is also a 5 minute cab ride to 5th Ave - the main shopping street in Playa Del Carmen. Senior Frogs is just off of 5th Ave. Just a warning: some of the vendors can be pushy! We called it Vulture Alley! Just stand firm and don't be afraid to be a little bit rude with the ones that are too pushy. About half way down the street is a mini-mart. We did most of our shopping here. It has the lowest prices ($3 t-shirts, $5 bottles of tequila, $3 bottles of pure vanilla) and has a wide variety of souvenirs for everyone on your shopping list. I would recommend hitting this store first and then finishing what shopping you have left at the little shops. I had a longing to go on a vacation for as long as I can remember. Now that I have been to the Iberostar Quetzal in Playacar, it has been replaced by a deep longing to go back.

Most importantly, don't stress if the weather shows rain. The forecast showed rain for three of our five days in Mexico and it rained in the middle of the night, one time, and that was it!! I traveled with my hubby, 40, my daughter 9, and I am 38. We requested a beach/pool location and when we found Carla, she was happy to change our room to building 21(facing inside the resort) instead of 23 (facing outside which is quite boring) We were on the first floor which was perfect for us. We saw lots of wildlife on the jungle walk between our room and the lobby and restaurant area. The monkeys visited our building on a couple occasions and we spotted them numerous times during our walks. My daughter was amazed with the jungle and enjoyed every walk we shared, never knowing what you would find. We even came upon a small mammal (?) nursing her baby. The pool and beach are amazing!! Spent lots of time in the ocean, some waves were a bit big but nothing overwhelming. The pool is a bit deep for kids, I think 5'1 ish, but there is a shallow end. I wish I would've brought rafts...must do for next time. The swim up bar pool is adults only. The walk to Playa Del Carmen shopping/ferry to Cozumel is about 45 minutes by beach. The taxi will cost you $7 one way. Walk to the south, pass one resort and you will have almost complete seclusion on a gorgeous beach. Don't panic with the nude beach signs...maybe a couple topless women...you'll see more at the resort beach itself. My daughter was fine once I explained....There are always beach chairs available on the beach, but if you want to be location specific by the pool, set up early. Breakfast buffet is open at 7am poolside, 8am near the lobby. We always ate breakfast and lunch by the pool/beach. Omelettes, meat, fruit, breads, etc. There is NO ac at the buffets and it does get quite hot without any breeze...closer to the water more chance of a little wind to cool you off. We were not impressed with the idea of no ac, it tends to get a little uncomfortable. There is also no bar in the front buffets...wine or beer only....bring a cocktail with you. Lobby bar has top shelf liquour!! Although you have many food options, certain restaurants are only available on certain nights and you are only able to make reservations for 2-3 evenings, depending on how long you stay. We were able to make 2 reservations then we were stuck with the buffet. You can inquire for additional reservations in the afternoon and maybe they will accomodate your request for that evening. They did not allow us to make additional reservations. The steak house was good,(best sour cream ever...ask for more) breeze kept us cool. Hibachi was ok, HOT, even though they claim to have ac...they need to notch the temp down a bit :) The fridge items, as they explained, were kept \"fresh\" not cold so the bottled water, pops, beers, etc. could've been colder. The pool entertainment was fine, not too crazy by any means. The kids club was small, not very exciting, not many activities and never ran on schedule. My daughter chose not to participate. Very minor disappointments as you can see. We did take the ferry to Cozumel, rented a jeep and cruised to the Iberostar there...it's all inclusive for Quetzal/Tucan guests as well. Free snorkeling/gear use from their beach...walk out to the stairs on the dock. We saw lots of fish, starfish...great time. Their resort was awesome!! We plan on returning to Iberostar Coz in November. If you have the time, definitely go to Cozumel, cruise the main road along the coastline, check out Coconuts...beautiful scenery. You won't be disappointed. Taxi to Coconuts is $20 each way so you're better off with your own rental. Resort entertainment was fine, nothing exciting, but they work their butts off so spend a few bucks on tips. The staff deserve it!! I would absolutely go back!!!

Previously we had stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe Coba and the Ocean Coral and Turquesa. Nothing wrong with those places but this one was just better. Within 5 minutes of check-in, we saw peacocks, capabara, swans, turtles flamingos, koi, monkeys etc. You can't walk 20 ft without seeing some sort of animal. One day I was sitting at the pool with my feet in the water and a plate full of snacks next to me. All of the sudden an iguana comes out of the bushes and starts eating from my plate. Since it was about 4 ft long, I didn't agrue with him. The greatest thing about this resort is the pool - HUGE. The place was at capacity, yet if never felt crowded. It has lots of entry points, 2 with zero entry which is great for young children. You can't see from one end to the other because of all the twists and turns it has. On top of the that the water was like bath water. I never had any problem finding chairs. There are also some awesome palapas with cushions on, but get up by 5:30 if you have any chance of getting one. There is also a small kids pool and a normal pool used for scuba and basketball. Food-good, but not great. Your typical resort style food. I would rate it slightly better than what I have had in the past. Yes, it does get repetitive after a week, but I always found something that I liked. I also found that the snack bar by the pool had a bigger selection of food than I have had at past resorts. The specialty restaurants were fine. We went to the Italian and the Mexican. Both had a decent selection and the service was prompt. Rooms- probably the worst part of the resort. They were the smallest that I have had in any of my stays to Mexico. There are no dressers and the closet in adequate. The bathroom is also small and there is no bathtub, the shower had awesome pressure and the water was always warm. The beach- not to my liking. Big waves when I was there. Lots of people with boogie boards or just riding the surf. If you like snorkeling, this is not the place. I put my mask on and didn't see anything, couldn't even see the bottom as a matter of fact. If you are a sun worshipper and like very fine sand, than you'll love this beach. A couple of quick notes- We spent a day at the Iberostar Cozumel. It is free to stay there for the day and use the ammentites. The only cost is getting there. $25/per person for the ferry and a car rental $60. It was a nice change of pace. Snorkeling off shore is decent and if you are going to go on a snorkeling trip, you might want to spend the money to get there. Lastly - the only reason that I didn't give this 5 stars, is because the resort is on the older side and it might need an update. A very minor update. Just little things that are starting to show. Never did see any of the shows, they all start to late. My son, 8, wanted to see the magic show, so we were told it would start about 8:30. We left when it didn't start and it was 9:30. It was just to late for us.

The great service started at check in where the front desk manager, Alejandro, checked us in-we were originally going to be in a building far from the beach and pool and he did not hesitate to check to see if there were other buildings available. We got one in building 21 which was fabulous. Very close to the beach and pool. The only down side to it was that we faced the RIU next door and we would hear their music every night. No major problem. I kept hearing that the beds were really hard and that we would need to ask for a egg crate pad but didn't find that to be the case. The beds were very comfy. I can tell you also that we never had a problem with ants that we often have had at other resorts. The room had a safe that was offered at no charge-again, unlike other resorts that we had to pay $2.00/day for. The mini bar was stocked with beer, soda and plenty of water. The service in all of the restaurants/bars was great. Francisco was one of our regular waiters for breakfast/lunch and always took care of us fabulously. I would brew tea to make iced tea as the tea in the dispensers was always sweetened and after he saw me do it the first time he would always bring me the hot water in a large glass and multiple tea bags as well as fill my own insulated cup (I highly recommend getting the insulated Tervis cups to bring along-keeps your beverages very cold for a long time plus they are larger than the hotel glasses) with ice. He always welcomed our daughters by their name whenever he saw them. Orlando and a couple of other chefs in the morning were always willing to go to the back to get some pico de gallo for me even though it wasn't normally offered at breakfast time. The food was great at all restaurants. The buffet had a very large selection for b/l/d although once we found that the seafood restaurant by the pool/beach served b/l that's where we ate most of the time. We ate at three ala carte restaurants; the seafood, the Japanese and the steak. My favorite would be the steak. I really wish we could have had an opportunity to try the Italian but we took whatever we could that wasn't at 9:00. I don't know why it seems like they have open tables but won't let more people in to dine at the earlier hours. That would probably be my only complaint. The buffet for dinner was always very good and plenty of options. I will agree with so many others that said that the ice cream was fabulous- we all loved the coconut ice cream and would be bummed when that flavor wasn't available. The beach was great. We spent so much time in the ocean that we only went in the fabulous pool once. The pool was very warm-much like bath water. The grounds personnel did a great job cleaning the seaweed off the beach every day. I was glad to see that there was very few topless sunbathers around-teenage kids from the US aren't accustomed to that as they are in Europe. Oh, I have to talk about the animals around the property! We got to see the monkeys and it was so exciting. We went out early in the morning and heard them over towards the Tucan side. We followed their howls and found them on the rooftop of one of the villas. Another night we were walking to the lobby and found another type on the Quetzal side. The were swinging from tree to tree and were so fun to watch. Peacocks and chickens roamed the grounds as well as Tezekees (sp) the were as prevalent as squirrels in the Midwest but looked had short front legs and longer back legs. Only one time were we able to stay up late enough to go to the shows. A great theater but it was too warm and smokey so we had to leave. The Star crew was very good.

They have many different animals (monkeys, swans, fish, iguanas, parrots, turtles, and more) around the hotel which I know kids would love! The rooms are so clean. I was impressed! The next morning when we woke up we found ants in our room! We were going to report it, but decided we would do it after breakfast because we were extremely hungry.

Well, when we got there with our entertainer (from Quetzal) he left us there with a friend of his. He told us he would be back and told us we would enter in a few minutes. That did not happen. We stood in line for over and hour. It was jammed packed in Coco Bongo! We were told we would have a place to sit. Didn't happen. My husband and I did not enjoy it, so we decided to leave. So I would be careful on what they tell you. Make sure if you go out with them you get what they tell you, or else you'll end up spending a lot of money for nothing.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Maui, Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cAwesome; You will Love it\u201d", "Author": "travel_fan38", "ReviewID": "UR104566098", "Content": "Our family of 4 (husband/wife, 13-year-old son; 15-year-old daughter) had the best time of our lives. We cannot say enough good things about Iberostar Quetzal. Loved:Beatiful, large, white-sand beach that extends onto other properties. I love walking the beach, but it extended so far down the coast it was too far for even me to walk.No lines for food or drinks. Tasty meals with tons of variety. Everything fresh & hot/cold.Japanese restaurant was an out-of-this-world experience as they do \"show-cooking\" there with the chef in the center of a table of 18 people. Our entire family loved watching the \"show\" PLUS the food was the best Asian food we have ever eaten. My son even tried octopus. Mini-bars were refilled DAILY with lots of soda/bottled water/beer, even though signs indicated they would be refilled every other day.Staff (waitpersons, maids, bartenders, \"Star friends\" (activity directors) were all GENUINELY friendly and kind.Free-roaming animals provided an incredible experience we've never seen anywhere else in our travels. Tons of beautiful peacocks walking around; parrots, monkies in the treetops, large tortoises in a garden-like enclosure, flamingoes (confined to a pond area).We felt very safe here. To get into the general area (named Playacar), the driver has to surrender their drivers license. Yes, the bed was firm, but I slept better on it than I do on my soft bed at home. Yes, we also had tiny ants on the sink in our bathroom, but we did not let it bother us. Yes, the huts/palapas and poolside chairs were all \"reserved' with towels/personal items before 7 am BUT you can always get a large beach umbrella from the towel shop and set up on the beach AND IT IS JUST AS GOOD AND JUST AS FUN as hut/pool! The only thing that could have made it even better is if there were activities targeted JUST for teens, or a teen center or some way for teens to meet each other. We spent several days of great quality time alone with our almost-13-year-old son, but he really wanted to meet up with some boys his age. After several days, he finally got in with a couple boys who were playing ping-pong and then had fun with them for our remaining days. But it would have been much easier if they had some activities specifically set up for that age range. The \"Kids Klub\" turned out to be for much younger children. Now, here are a few tips: 1. When we arrived at Cancun airport, we assumed that the airport porter offering to port our bags was with Lomas Travel. We had rolling suitcases which are easy to pull along, but the porters (in light blue shirts) grabbed them and reassured us (in broken English) they were with Lomas Travel. In fact, they work for the airport and took us a short distance outside to the actual Lomas Travel reps (in blue/green shirts), then expected a tip. 2. We were unable to make a toll-free call from the payphone in the lobby, in order to confirm our return trip. So we were kinda just going on faith that our return plans had not been changed in the 6 days we were on vacation. That made us a little nervous. 3. For the ladies, I would recommend bringing a nail file and a heel file. My fingernails got sand/grit under them and were dirty the whole time I was there but I had nothing to clean them! My heels got really grungy walking in the sand, and I wished I'd had my trusty heel file from home to clean them up after each shower then slather with lotion. 4. Non-motorized watersports are included BUT do not make that the decision-maker when choosing a hotel, because many days you cannot use them due to windy conditions. The flag was red half our time there, and yellow (caution) the remainder, so we couldn't take out kayaks or anything. We were a little disappointed about that, but the hotel can't control the weather and we understand that. My point is, don't let the availability of watersports make/break your decision when choosing a locale. 5. BEFORE we arrived in Playa del Carmen, we planned to take a day and go to Cozumel and spend the day at the sister hotel Iberostar Cozumel, enjoying their free snorkeling/restaurants/beach/etc. HOWEVER, once we arrived at Iberostar Quetzal and spoke with the front desk staff, we realized it would have cost $200 for our family of 4 just in transportation. To get from Quetzal to the dock is only $7 for a taxi; the ferry to island of Cozumel is $15/per person each way; taxi from Cozumel dock to Iberostar Cozumel is $30 each way. We would have loved to see Cozumel and experience their snorkeling, but couldn't see paying $200 to do so.6. We did take the Dressel Divers snorkeling tour from Iberostar Quetzal beach, which is a 15-minute boat ride south down the coast. For the $40 each, it was OK in order to introduce our children to their first time of snorkeling, just to find out how they liked it. (They both took to it like fish.) However, I thought the waves at the reef were too large, and the fish were not very plentiful, and the guide (in his defense he was trying to keep us all together for safety and to keep a headcount) constantly kept us swimming and moving. True, he was trying to move us around in order to see fish, but we never got a chance to just float there and ENJOY. It was hard work! 7. Yes, Playa del Carmen IS on Central Time Zone, BUT depending on what time of year you are there, you may or may not be on the same time as \"home\"! That is because they start their Daylight Savings Time later than we do. Whereas we started DST in March, theirs does not \"spring forward\" until April 3! So we did lose an hour on our last night there.

We weren't supposed to stay at Iberostar, we were supposed to stay at Viva Wyndham Maya but they overbooked and sent us here. Well, weren't we lucky...the hotel is amazing. It's like staying in a jungle resort. We woke up every morning to all sounds of nature, it was really quite peaceful. The rooms were a nice size and clean and the beach was spectacular. The staff was really warm and friendly. The food could have been better, especially since this is a five star resort, but aside from a boring selection, it was always cooked well and tasty. We were only able to book one restaurant, so we booked the Mexican one. That was a good choice because the food was delicious, as well as the buffet style appetizers and deserts-try the rice pudding, it was great. We really enjoyed walking through the jungle area and seeing the monkeys, peacocks, these little rodent looking things (they aren't rats, and they don't bother you), iguanas, toucans, flamingos, ducks, giant turtles, little turtles, funny parrots who whistle at you...this resort has it all. The entertainment was actually really good, we even got to see a magic show which was awesome. The pool was really huge and very clean, one of the cleanest pools I've ever been in. The beach was even cleaner, not a single piece of garbage. The water was the most amazing color of blue and so warm. I only warn that you put a ton of sunblock on as my fiance and I got really burnt (even with sunblock all day) and suffered for it. Overall, this resort was great.

We stayed in the Quetzal part. This was my second time in Playacar that year. The resort itself has 2 parts: Quetzal, which is 5 stars and Tucan, which is 4. They both basically use the same restaurants and bars but the Quetzal has better rooms. THE GOOD: 1. The resort is absolutely beautiful! You might get lost, but it's ok because you will keep stumbling upon all kinds of cool things. There is a waterfall with swans swimming about, a giant turtle pen, a bunch of parrots (not caged), flamingos, tucans, the cute furry animals with a long tail (forgot what they are called), iguanas, etc. The walkways are all stone, surrounded by trees and shrubs, protecting you from the sun and giving quite the jungle feeling (without the poisonous bugs, of course). 2. The restaurants are big, good food, a bit hard to get to sometimes but once you find them, it's worth it. 3. The A la Carte restaurants are really good. We went to two of them and they had quite the options. Very yummy. 4. The beach is incredible. They have a very large beach with a bar and you can almost always find a space under an umbrella. 5. The rooms were amazing. Comfortable beds, nice TV, fancy and big bathroom. Our balcony was big too and it faced the jungle and a cave so it was quite relaxing to hear the breeze in the trees. THE NOT SO GOOD: 1. The resort is big and it's hard to find your way around. We got lost multiple times, especially at night and there aren't too many maps to guide you. 2. I didn't really see much animation staff. Never went to a show, but the theatre was big and I saw the dancers practicing and moving all kinds of cool decorations around all the time. 3. The staff were not too friendly and I was \"attacked\" by a few because I was showing my girl friend around the resort. My friend was staying at the next hotel up and I wanted to show her the swans, and the whole cool jungle feeling of the place. I was simply showing her around (did not get her a drink or food) when suddenly, one of the lobby staff charged at us and started questioning me why my friend was there. When I told him that she was just looking around because it was pretty, he told us to immediately go to the lobby because I am being charged $370 to my room (for the night) if she wants to stay there! When I told him she doesn't cause she's at the other hotel, he said that he will have to charge me the day pass, something like $85! I told him to relax, he started raising his voice at us, called the security and had us escorted out right away! WHAT????? I'm sorry, but if this is how the lobby, hence \"welcoming\" staff treat the guests at this 5 star resort, I do not ever want to go back. I really felt attacked, wrongly accused and threatened. So, beautiful resort, great rooms, lovely beach, great restaurants but the staff, not so much. I had an amazing time because I was with a great group of friends. But that one incident really ruined everything for me and I will never go back there. My friend will never book a trip there either.

We've taken our kids to Walt Disney World in Florida, and Beaches Sandy Bay in Negril, Jamaica, and now here... Iberostar Quetzal. We stayed at the quetzal from Dec 13-20 with our kiddos, ages 9,7 and 2. My review will be based on this experience. Our first priority in planning our trip (other than safety of our kids, of course) was the beach. We are beach people and did NOT want to go to mexico only to stay at a rocky, mossy beach. Now, I'm not blaming the hotel when these conditions exist, only saying that this is not what we want. I had read that the beach at the Quetzal/Tucan was phenomenal, and it WAS! No rocks, a lot of small shells, but completely walkable with bare feet. Our kids thought the sand and beach was the best part of the trip. We even spent two day from 9am-4pm at the beach without leaving! The beach at the resort is HUGE, there is a lot of area from the edge of the resort to the edge of the water. This was fantastic, as we were there at a very busy season (Christmas) and the resort was at 100% capacity. The palapas were always full by 7am... at least by towels. But we wanted to be closer to the water anyway, so the fact that the resort checks out umbrellas was perfect for us. We had booked two connecting rooms since there are 5 of us, so we got to check out 2 umbrellas for the beach. Plenty of shade, plenty of room. We had to fight for chairs though. The towel game is in full force. We went without chairs on a couple of days, laying out towels and having our daughter sleep on a towel in the sand, only to look around to hundreds of empty chairs with towelson them for hours and hours. We finally got sick of it and took chairs, leaving towels on the sand. I waited for someone to say something about this, and no one ever did. Sadly, I think people stake out their chairs, then go eat, go back to bed, whatever. This is soooo frustrating, especially when you have a two year old that you are trying to keep happy and keep out of the sun as much as possible. Rooms: No complaints. We had two rooms that connected. I emailed the resort the week before and they said they would try to accomodate this request. They did! The rooms were perfect. Food: always a selection that the kids liked, and we coudln't complain about. We made reservations at some of the ala cartes, and the Japanese was our favorite.... but not the kids! They liked the show, but ended up eating pasta at the buffet after we left the restaurant! We enjoyed room service a lot, because of our napping 2 year old. The Mexican tacos were AWESOME! and the kids enjoyed the pizza and chicken nuggets. The rooms were always cleaned when we were gone to the beach, and cleaned very well. The kids loved the towel animals. Pool: COLD! We dipped our toes in and that's it! I saw a couple of kids swimming in the pool once, but they looked blue! We spent all of our time at the beach anyway, so the pool temp didn't matter to us. Favorites: Some of the best things about staying here.... the animals! my kids (and myself) loved to see all of the monkeys, peacocks, pelicans, birds and other wildlife throught the resort. There truly is a jungle in between the restaurants and the beach, and if you choose to walk the winding path through it you will hear and see some beautiful animals! Also, self-serve ice cream and drinks on the beach! my boys couldn't get over the fact that they could walk up whenever they wanted and get ice cream. A little boy's dream! We walked into Playa on our second day there because a cold front hit and the water was frrrrrrreezing! It would have been a great walk if we didn't have the kiddos.... ended up carrying our 2 year old and pushing our 7 year old in the umbrella stroller! We took a cab back.... much smarter!

I am writing this review because I rely on this reviews when I chose a resort. This one is not worth it. First, our room which was located by the lobb,y 2029, has small ants in the bathroom. So gross. When we informed the staff they stated that the cleaning staff would scrub the bathroom from top to bottom. They were still there, especially at night. The bathrooms are pretty contemporary but the rooms are hacienda in style and small. The beds are extremely hard. My husband and I usually stay in more contemporary and upscale resorts, so we were disappointed. The pool area and beach were PACKED. We had to fight for chairs, which is very annoying and unnecessary on vacation. There were tons of children and drunk spring breakers. I was hoping for more adults and a more respectable environment for such an \"upscale\" resort. The drinks were great and you didn't wait in line long. Reserve your \"specialty\" restaurant ASAP because they fill up fast. They don't tell you that you can only visit the \"specialty\" restaurants depending on your number of days you stay. (3 days - 1 restaurant, 4-5 days -2 restaurants, 6-7 - 3 restaurants). Steak house was the best !! The buffet located by the lobby was good, especially breakfast. The Lobby at night was nice. My husband and I read our books and had numerous drinks and enjoyed the light piano or light singing. The lobby at night is great for couples and adults......great conversation, calm and relaxing.....comfortable couches. Really loved the free roaming animals through out the resort and beautiful landscape. Peacocks, Flamingos and Iguanas. Be aware that internet is about $14/day and only available in the Lobby which wasn't too much of a problem for us since we liked the lobby at night, but pricey, especially since it is per day. My husband and I expected more for the price. Not horrible but not great. We usually enjoy resorts with more adults and less children. I hope this helps couples like my husband and I. P.S.

A wonderful, safe and accommodating experience, with only a few quibbles. The best parts: - Staff. They really go all out to help with whatever they can - mattress foam, water to take with you on excursions, etc. Very helpful, very friendly and upbeat. Star Friends are not at all pushy; they seem to be able to get people dancing in the pool and on the beach without prodding anyone. Also they coordinated a kids' canoe race in the pool. - The main pool. HUGE and clean. You can't see the whole thing from one spot, and so there can be a canoe race going on in one part and free swim in the rest. Chairs or palapas were terrific. - The beach. Lots of chairs and palapas, framed by an ocean of the most amazing turquoise, blue and green. - Snorkeling. 15-minute trip by boat to a sheltered inlet a bit south. Really safe for first time snorkelers like my kids. Water is 5-10 feet deep. - The grounds. Two dozen acres of jungle filled with wildlife and trails lit throughout at night. Kids loved hunting for monkeys and agoudes (giant squirrels without tails). Peacocks everywhere. Also the hotel's walkways with blue and green pillars are beautiful. - Food. I actually thought the food was quite good at the buffet. Yes, it's largely the same fare every day. But it's fresh and safe; the variety of fruit, meat, bread and desserts was pretty impressive. And one of the days we were there they served a massive seafood paella on the beach that you could smell everywhere. (See specialty restaurants below for other detail). - Spa. The little girls with us had beautiful braids done quickly and not expensively. My daughter had nine braids across the top of her head (with flower beads) for about $25. The not-best parts: - The ride there from the Cancun airport. Yes, it's included, but do not assume as I did that it's a direct transfer. The hotel shares Lomas Travel services with other resorts that are closer to the airport. So they will wait to fill up a bus to Playa del Carmen, then drop everyone else off first because Quetzal and Tucan (same resort) are on the far side of PDC. Our trip to Iberostar took 90 minutes. If you want to save the time, try booking a private direct transfer. - Towels. When you check in you get white plastic cards that you exchange for pool towels. When you're done with the towels, you turn them in for your cards. Lose a towel or a card? $10 USD. - Cocktails at the pool. Kids lovedlovedloved bellying up to the bar by themselves to get virgin pina coladas and the like. But cocktails with alcohol were supersweet and didn't offer much of a buzz. - Specialty restaurants. Call before you get there to make reservations. At arrival, the only time we could get reservations was at 9 p.m., not good for the kids. Later, a spot opened at 6:30 at the Italian restaurant. It was only so-so; I preferred the buffet, believe it or not. Overall though, I would absolutely recommend this resort for families.

I have travelled the world from Asia, Europe and central America, stayed in a multitude of hotels from 3 to 5 star and ultra luxury hotels. This is my third visit to the Riviera Maya area and my 7th trip to Mexico. I have stayed at Riu, Bahia Principe, Barcelo, Palladium properties and a recent stay at the Sunset Princess Hotel in 2010. I always try to budget an all inclusive getaway per year keeping in mind my max is 1200$ per person. I would also like to remind reviewers that hotel ratings vary from country to country, from vacation providers and such. For example the European rating system only takes into account amenities offered on the resort whether there\u2019s a mini bar, pool, spa etc determines the start level nothing else. Vacation providers use a similar rating system, taking in to account customer experience and profitability (they appear to favor hotels that give them a kick back). Furthermore big hotel chains such as Riu\u2019s, Iberostar\u2019s and Bahia Principe\u2019s etc. offer different 5 star options at different price points remember the higher price points such as the Grand Hotels (Iberostar) Palace (Riu) etc. will give you newer hotel with more elaborate amenities and options. Our research included all the big chains, Princess which were all in the same price range. We also took into account the location to Playa and narrowed it down to Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal, Riu Yucatan, Riu Tequila, Barcelo Maya, and The Gran Sunset Princess. We wanted to try something new so the Princess was out of the question. Upon reading reviews both the Riu Tequila and Iberostar scored high and after hearing that the Riu Tequila was not on the beach we went for the Iberostar and didn\u2019t regret our choice one bit. Location 5/5: 30 min. safe jaunt to town, 5 min. by taxi. One of the last resorts on the strip. Keep in mind that your likely to be the last one off the bus if your taking the hotel transfer from the airport provided by the vacation operator. In hind sight I would have paid and booked a private transfer. (There\u2019s nothing the hotel can do about this) Beach 5/5: much better than the Bahia properties and the Grand Princess. Fine white sand lots of loungers to choose from some days were more difficult to find such as after a day of rain when the hotel was at capacity. Lots of palapas at the beach unlike the riu\u2019s that don\u2019t offer any. Beach umbrellas were available should you want to pull your lounger to a more quiet location or closer to the beautiful turquoise waters (I wish all resorts would offer this). All other properties on the beach did not allow patrons to pull loungers closer to the water. Ocean AMAZING blue, turquoise, aqua green need I say more. We had two red flag days which would stir up the sand, on calm days the water was clear. Not much to offer for snorkeling. Grounds 5/5: As others have mentioned there\u2019s a jungle filled with wildlife in the middle of the resort . Note: Rooms located closure to the mid hotel area will be awaken by wildlife specifically those pesky peacocks who moan and screech in the early morning.Which makes for a great walk to the beach or to the buffet. Beautiful lush mature vegetation which you don\u2019t find at newer hotels in the area. Pools 3/5: There\u2019s 4 pools on the resort one rectangular one on the Quetzal side which is used for sports activities such as water polo, basket ball etc. The main pool is huge and offers some lounger\u2019s in the shade, sun and 4-5 big beds under a hut good luck getting a hold of one they are reserved in the early morning and impossible to get. Loungers are sometimes hard to get during busy times of the day it wasn\u2019t a prob for us as we are beach people. The main pool is quite deep which has some advantages (keeps drunks and kids out) however may be too deep for some. Some complained about the pool temperature in other reviews however we found it comfortable. There\u2019s is no swim up bar at the main pool again it has some advantages but can be annoying as the adult pool which is small is full of drunkards and has the only bar on that side of the pool. There is also a small kids pool on the Tucan side close to the main pool and kids club. Unfortunately all pools are showing their age and could use and update, tiles and all. Compared to other hotels the pools just didn\u2019t cut it. Bars: 4/5: The annoying thing was top shelf alcohol is not available at the beach or pool. Nor was it provided when you order your drinks from the waiters. Every time I ordered a Gin/Tonic with Beefeater or Tangeray or Gibson they would come back with the local Gin which would be fine if the local gin was drinkable but it wasn\u2019t it tasted like bubble gum. So if you want top shelf order it at the bar. I find this a little sneaky. But not a deal breaker as many hotels have this type of policy. Other wise drinks were readily available service was great and they had tones of options as all other allinclusives drinks are week order doubles. In room mini bar was fill ed every day unlike advertised which is a plus, we did tip everyday. Rooms 4/5: Showing there age, beds are hard we ordered the available mattress pad which resolved that problem. No bathtubs, shower only, and one sink. No flat screen though I hear some rooms were being changed. Overall no big deal it was impeccably clean and provided the amenities as advertised. High Def TV with ample english choices and on demand pay per view channels available. Could use an update isn\u2019t as nice as the newer hotels but met my needs. Entertainment 5/5: Star friends are everywhere not overbearing but help make the experience more enjoyable when you want to take advantage of the activities. Great staff good experience. Nightly shows are better than the average with live music every night. Patrons at the hotel was a good mix of European and North American which made for a good range of people which I find entertaining in itself. The disco was always happening unlike other resorts I have been too. Overall entertainment above par than others. Food 4/5: Standard run of the mill resort hotel food with better choices than some never left hungry however sometimes a little underwhelmed Spa 4/5: though I didn\u2019t try any of their services two in our party did. They both had a exfoliation rub and a chocolate wrap for about 130$ per person which lasted a little under two hours. They were both very satisfied with their purchase thought the price was just about the same as at home which I find expensive for Mexico. Service 6/5: The strong point of this hotel Exceptional attentive staff from all points. Buffet service was excellent. Maid service excellent. Beach/Pool service excellent. Theater and Lobby bar service excellent. Service with a smile at all times. Waiters always talked and joked with patrons.

After all, rated so well by so many people, Iberostar Quetzal seemed so worth visiting. Now that we've come back, I am sorry to report that it did not meet our expectations. But let's start from the beginning. When you are booking a stay at Iberostar - Quetzal or Tucan - be ready for the following: - wearing bracelets that you will not be able to take off until your stay is over - carrying towel cards with you and paying if your card or your towel is taken by someone while you leave it on the beach or near the pool - eating at a buffet for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with little change in menu: by our last day (we stayed 7 nights), we were so tired of the same food, we chose not to eat there at all - having to make reservations for a-la cart restaurants (3 reservations granted for a 7-night stay) and being ready to be rejected because the restaurants are full - finding that all the good spots near the pool are taken at 6AM by people who drop their stuff and go back to bed (while this is not allowed, it is happening all the time and the staff does not take any action). So do the same, or be doomed to either a poor spot or no spot at all. Anyways, here's our experience further. Upon check-in, we were given a room on the ground floor in building 28, the closest to the lobby and almost farthest from the pool and the beach. From the artificial air freshener and to the dark and gloomy outside balcony, we hated it. So we went to the front desk to ask for a different room. Wish granted, our second room was slightly better, though in building 29, the last building of the resort bordering on the fence! It did not stink though so we settled in. Same evening, we realized that we forgot our beach towel cards when we were switching rooms. Going to the reception shortly after and wasting over an hour resulted in nothing - we had to pay $100 pesos for each card left. With such a bad start, we did our best to avoid the reception and its staff for the remainder of our stay. More about the food: the choice does not vary much by meal and day of the week. While I have to be just and say that the food quality was ok, we were so tired of the same thing all the time! Additionally, try not to look at the glasses and the plates: after I did, I had a hard time eating there at all. Also, we thought that most juices and milk taste very artificial and watered down. Same for many of the alcohol mixes - avoid their pina colada for it tastes wrong! The only thing we really liked was the beach ice cream - delicious flavors and very close to the beach and the pool, it was a nice touch to the otherwise poor food and beverages. Now, a word on room service: it is very prompt but the food sucks beyond belief. The Caesar salad was swimming in water (I assume, from when the salad leaves were washed?) and wraps can be best described as two corn tortillas with stuff between them - all tasteless and falling apart. We did not order any of the desserts. The mini fridge is another thing that was not all that bad - with good beer and soda choices, though no juice. We did not have a problem with refills either - they were daily and prompt. Again, to be just, I have to say that we really liked the evening shows. The crew did a very fine job and the quality of some of their shows is astonishing. Without the shows, the evenings would have sucked - for there's hardly anything else to do and the food is awful. The other thing we liked (and, trust me, we only liked a couple, really) was the swimming pool. It was large, well-maintained, with the right temperature. Unlike the beach, where the sea is always in revolt and unsafe for kids under the age of 12, the pool was a nice place to spend most of the day (granted we were lucky to get spots). In summary, for the $3K we paid to stay there for a week, it was a rather poor value for the money: it was not dramatically bad (hey, it could always be worse!) but nothing compared to many other similarly priced all-inclusives in Riviera Maya. So my advice to you is to avoid Iberostar if you enjoy good food, expect a nice room, and don't like to be nickel-and-dimed for stolen beach towels or lost towel cards. Oh, and if you may be thinking that the Iberostar on Cozumel is nicer, you are in for a treat: it is much worse than Quetzal or Tucan.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ain", "Title": "\u201cLovely hotel but too noisy and overcrowded\u201d", "Author": "Dominique01", "ReviewID": "UR99619698", "Content": "The hotel itself is excellent with great facilities and the grounds of the hotel are superb - just like being in the middle of the jungle.

The beach is lovely but there were far too many people and far too few palapas and sunbeds - thus impossible to find somewhere to sit, whether in the shade or in the sun if one didn't arrive on the beach very early. We did have a problem with the room assigned to us when we arrived as we hadn't realized that it was right opposite the evening entertainment area. In consequence it was impossible to go to sleep until after the entertainment was finished as the noise was so loud. We put up with it for 2 nights and then asked to change rooms; unfortunately the hotel was full up and we had to put up with another night of no sleep before we were changed to a room that was further away from the noise. Before arriving in the Iberostar we had spent 2 weeks touring around Mexico and had had a superb time wherever we went; however, it was only in Playacar that we found ourselves surrounded by a lot of Americans - and my goodness how loud they are. For some reason they seem to find it impossible to talk quietly, they have to shout. Impossible therefore to have a quiet drink and chat in the bar in the Iberostar. We had specifically chosen holiday dates outside of the American's spring break in order to avoid this problem - but it appears that the adults are no different from the school kids. If you can find a quiet time of the year to go to the hotel I would recommend it as it really is a lovely hotel.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "gabriela730", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Vacation with the family!!!!\u201d", "Author": "gabriela730", "ReviewID": "UR99048812", "Content": "Let me break our trip up into sections. First of all let me start off with NEVER NEVER fly a charter flight with Funjet and/or AeroMexico. We were suppose to be departing at 7 am however when we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before at the check in counter we were informed that our plane was still in Cancun and they were waiting for a part and that the plane should arrive at the airport by 1pm. Well with a small child that's been excited to go and awake since 2 am this was extremely upsetting. Also, why were we never informed about a delay ahead of time.(you can't check a charter flight online) so to say the least we were not starting our trip off right. Some people waiting however some went ahead and purchased tickets with United over the phone. I have to praise united it was fast and easy. We got a 9am flight and were out an additional $1500 for 5 of us. In addition, there was a Funjet rep at the airport and not only was she rude and not helpful but had no ideas of how she/ Funjet could help. Therefore I would think twice before using Funjet especially a charter flight. Resort: excellent!! Grounds were gorgeous and clean. Beautiful setting for families and anyone looking to relax. There were different animals all over the grounds but in certain areas almost if they were trained to stay there. Rooms: like all resorts not what you have at home but its a vacation. The bright decor will wake you up. Bathrooms are very nice and clean. A one per person at a time space. Showers are perfect. We have a 3 yr old and the shower was large and the shower head came out so it made it easy to use. We had booked for the queztal side but stayed on the Tucan side. Asked for an upgrade to oceanview rooms but they were not available. Wish I knew how to contact them ahead of time. Food: is good. At the steakhouse I had the tenderloin it was to die for with the fresh herb butter. Also, we ate at the Mexican restaurant had the steak as well the arrachera wonderful. But the seafood was ok. Buffet was Yum. The last day I discovered phenomenal banana cream/ pudding at lunch at the main buffet on the queztal side. Drinks are ok nothing special. Drank the champagne the last two days. Got tired of beer and over sugared drinks. Entertainment: nothing big. They have your typical resort shows. Checked out the club but it wasn't busy with anyone. Overall, wonderful pools with activities by the pool for kids such as painting ceramics and delicious ICE CREAM!! MUST TRY. by the showers as well as by the outdoor lunch snack bar.

This place is absolutely beautiful! The grounds make the entire place! You literally are inside a jungle. The animal life is awesome! The kids loved the monkeys, peacocks, birds, iguanas, flamingos and the rest of the animals on the grounds. The workers were so friendly. We were in the 2500 building on the third floor. The beds are hard and we requested the extra foam pad and we all agreed that it helped with the sleeping comfort. The monkeys woke us up each morning along with the peacocks the beginning of the week. After the first couple days you learn to toon them out and roll over and go back to sleep. The rooms are just standard rooms. No complaints except maybe the bathroom could be a little bigger. But how much time do you spend in your room? Not much as there is so much to do on the grounds. We tipped our maid $2-3 dollars each day and our room was always clean, stocked and had cute towel art for the kids each day. The internet you do have to pay for which is a bummer ($2 for every 15 minutes). The internet is only available in the lobby which is the only other bummer. The beach is beautiful! The week we were there was pretty windy and wavey and the red flag was out most days. The last full day we were there the yellow flag was out and we were able to reserve the catamaran and wind surf. The other days the kids played in the waves and had a blast (ages 12 and 9). They loved doing the pool games each day at noon. The hotel staff really goes out of their way to make it fun each day. The bar by the beach has a great staff. These people work so hard so a tip here and there goes a long way and is appreciated! I would also recommend bringing your own mug to fill as the cups they offer are quite small so if you don't want to go back frequently bring your own large plastic mug...works great! Each morning we reserved a spot (placing a towel or book on the beach chairs) each day. It says its against the hotel rules but everyone did this and if you did not reserve your spot you were stuck somehwere you didn't want to be (especially if you had kids and wanted to be near the pool and the ocean). We did reserve a hut each day as well (placing a towel, book and shoes on the mattress). You do have to get there early as those get taken pretty quickly. I got one each day except the last day we were there ( I got up at 6:00 and was down there by 6:15 a.m. and they were all taken. The pool was just the right temperature. After reading reviews that people thought it was too cold I have to say it was perfect. I usually don't get in pools due to them being to cold and I have to say this pool was just the right temperature for this picky girl. The kids lived in the pool all day. The icecream by the beach bar is so good. Had to try the coconut icecream that everyone recommended on here andI have to agree its great! The kids even tried the free scuba diving in the pool. What a great opportunity to try something new. The ocean was warmer then the pool. The night shows are amazing! They start at 9:30 p.m. and I have to say this resort goes out of their way to make them great! The Michael Jackson impersonator was a great dancer. The dancers from the show often go to the disco bar after the shows as well. They do a great job trying to get the crowd involved. We ate at the Italian, Steak house and Japenese restaurants and have to say they were all good. The Japenese dinner was fun since its done hibachi style. The kids loved the show the chef put on with his knives and tricks. The steak house dinner was also good as well and had many choices. The Italian restaurant was good but our least favorite. We stayed at the Sando's last year (right next door to the Iberostar) and although that was a great vacation and place to stay I have to say this place is definetly way better (again the grounds are amazing, so beautiful and well maintained). We usually don't stay at the same place twice because we like to try different resorts but I have to say the group of 8 all agree that next year we will be here again.

My friend and I just spent a week at Iberostar Quitzal/Iberostar Tucan in Playcar, Playa del Carmen, Mexico. We were picked up at airport by hotel shuttle, and although check in was not until 3 pm , we were able to get into our room at 10 am. This hotel/resort shares the beautiful property with the Iberostar Tucan and both are fully open to each others quests. The resort seemed to be built around a jungle, with beautiful birds and animals everywhere you walk. The beach is very long and beautiful with lots of loungers , beds, umbrellas and Palapas. The pool which is right on the beach is large but maybe a bit congested as there are two large resturants on either side of pool. These resturants are open all day and have a very large food selection not just you regular hamburgers and hotdogs and tocos. The resort is very clean and well maintained with wonderful nature walkways. It is completely wheel chair accessable, including the pool. There two very large buffet ressturants with a very wide range of choices for the most picky of eater of which I am one. Plus two resturants on the beach. There are four a la carte resturants as well , and the food is very good. The staff are very courtious ,friendly and very accommadating. The rooms are large and comfortable. If you find the bed too hard, you can ask for a topper. The area is very safe and if you which to leave the resort Fifth avenue is only a $5.00 taxi ride away and it too is very safe. We traveled around the whole Playa del Carmen area and found it to be very save. The news media is painting Mexico with a black brush, As tourists we have to be aware that our own home towns and cities are not crime free and Mexico is no different. I am sure some Mexican Boader towns have some very bad areas as do most major cities. I was recently in Tejuana and other than crazy traffic, it was also safe. Again, I did not go to areas which were not recommended as safe by the hotel I was staying at.. I recommend Iberostar and Playa del Carmen to both families and adult s only.

It was our third stay at the Tucan/Quetzal, and, as always, we've had a great time. (BTW, Quetzal and Tucan are two sides of the same property. They share amenities and are identical - it is not clear to me why Tucan has higher rating on Tripadvisor than Quetzal). As always, the service was great, and the rooms and grounds were meticulously maintained. On our stay two years ago, the room was showing signs of wear and tear, and this year we noticed that woodwork and bathroom walls and counters have been nicely restored. The beds and pillows are still hard, so if you want to sleep comfortably, ask for a foam topper and bring your own pillow - we did! We emailed ahead with room request, but they were unable to accommodate it this year because the hotel was full. They were willing to work with us though, so eventually (on the third day) we got what we wanted. As all reviewers mention, the property is beautiful and unique in a way it incorporates natural landscape. The passes through the jungle are illuminated at night, but the lights are rather dim, so small flush light and comfortable shoes might be helpful. The pool is gorgeous. It is 5.5' deep, and there are two shallow areas for non-swimmers and children. It is not heated, so the water can get chilly in the winter time. The wi-fi is only available at the lobby, and it is expensive. There are also two public computers at the Tucan lobby (2 USD for 15 minutes), but they are always busy. The food was very good. In fact, we found it to be better this year with more varieties and much less salt. They serve full breakfast and lunch at the beach snack bar on the Tucan side and at the buffet restaurant. The salad bar was better at the snack bar, but there were more sea food at the restaurant. The desserts were always great, and, if you are not afraid to put couple more pounds on, don't forget coffee hour between 4 and 5 PM at the Tucan snack bar - they serve 2-3 kinds of absolutely delicious cakes, different every day. The Italian restaurant was great with nice buffet style appetizers and desserts. The breakfast has always been the best. Officially, it starts at 7, but at the buffet restaurant you can get it even earlier if you go on an early excursion. For excursions, you can buy them at the hotel lobby. Shop around - there are always several reps there at the same time, so you might be able to get a better deal with somebody else, not necessarily with your vacation company rep. You can also find best deals online before going on your trip (cuncun-discounts has huge selection and convenient cancellation policy). But if you are an explorer at heart, go on your own. This area of Mexico is very safe, and there is cheap and reliable public transportation available. On our every visit, we always go on several day trips using taxi and colectivo vans - you can jump on it in Playa del Carmen, and it only costs $3 per person. Taxi is relatively inexpensive, and taxi drivers are always courteous and speak basic English. If you have more people in you group, you might consider hiring a taxi for a day - ask at the front desk. Renting a car is also an option. You cannot get lost since there is only one highway, but it might be confusing driving around Playa and finding places if you don't speak basic Spanish. It is very safe though, and Mexican drivers are surprisingly good. Also, if you rent a car, make sure to get full insurance and obey speed limit (it's in KM, not miles). This year, we visited several cenotes and went on the Sian Ka'an biosphere tour which was a highlight of our vacation. We did it with visitsiankaan - please see my separate review under Sian Ka'an. It is breathtaking - a must do if you are a nature lover. The hotel is very nice and a great value, but Rivera Maya has so much more to offer - go places to make more memories out of your vacation!

Both sides are very nice, I believe the views may be better on the outside rooms on the Tucan side. we were in the 1700 building on the top floor. At first I was disappointed and wanted something closer to the beach. BUT after we spent the day at the beach. Our nights were nice to be up by the lobby. We were going to upgrade to the beach halfway thru but decided against it as it was handy to be near our rooms for supper and retiring. The walk to the beach was thru the jungle it was nice or you could go around , that way the ground is more level we did this once. My husband thought the jungle was a stroke of genius as its shady all the way thru . We enjoyed eating at the Quetzal side as there is a large water feature surrounding it. The bar at the Quetzal looked to have more live music. But the lobby bar at Tucan had the best strawberry Margaritas. The entertainment in the evening is exactly in the middle. We always at lunch at the beach as we also did with breakfast. All the eating areas except the mexican and the Japanese restaraunts are open air but screened in to keep out the birds. I look for that when booking a holiday (I don't want to be inside when in the tropics). Japanese was great!!! Steak house great!!! and we had Mexican booked but went to senior frogs that night so we missed it but were told it was really great and order the kabobs. Tips seemed appreciated, but not necessary and did not affect service one bit. Service was always great. and We felt very welcomed. Not like the Dominican where we felt more tolerated. The food was always good and kept cool or hot as required. No one in our group or anyone we met got sick or even a stomach gurgle. And one morning at breakfast while waiting for my omelet the person in front of me tipped the gal making the omelets. She stopped took the tip, thanked him, went to the sink washed her hands with soap dried them and came back to apologize to me. That is impressive and probably a big reason why no one fell ill. The beach was wonderful not sure what others are complaining about ......uh sand is gritty! and its nice to find shells we were at the ocean. At the towel counter you can ask for a portable umbrella......no need to wake up early. and there was ALWAYS chairs no matter what time. Our room was always cleaned well and the fridge was stocked daily ( we do leave a buck in the fridge daily anywhere we go) With beautiful towel art daily. The only room complaint I might mention is the bathroom did smell musty but you are in the tropics we left the bathroom fan on all the time with the door closed which took care of the mustiness. Beds are hard as in cuba......but then again we did not ask for a topper and could have. My boy and I went to cozmel with the dive centre he dived I snorkeled. They took you to the Iberostar resort there for food drinks. It was a great day trip. The dive team is very professional and made for a great trip. We also did the Xel-cha Tulum trip.......Tulum was alot more interesting than I thought it may be......although Xel-cha was a fun day if I was to do it again I would spend more time at Tulum. Take your bathing suit and snorkel gear and would have spent the whole day there. there are shops and bars and they put on a show we missed and the ruins there are very intersting we could have followed tour guide ofter tour guide they all had different tings to say. There was no language barrier.

I was in Playa del Carmen last year with a friend as well so have many comparisons from the previous resort. Pros: Lush green scenery, beautiful beach with many chairs, large pool, ice cream by the pool (you must try the coconut), service was good, they had a lot of activities if you are looking for that, on-site certified scuba team, on site snorkeling, close to downtown ($5 cab ride each way), a few miles walk. The japanese restaurant was the best. The grill by the beach was nice to get food whenever as the other restaurants close for a few hours between 10-1 and then again the in evening. Cons: Beds were like sleeping on wood (no exaggeration), rooms were a little outdated, rocky pathways (make sure to wear sturdy shoes or wedges - no heels), service around the pool for beverages was very very slow, many times they only had one server for the whole pool where other resorts have multiple waitstaff. The information regarding the resort online states that all international beverages are available in the all inclusive package, however, they only offer one beer, and not many domestic liquors. If you have a preference in drink you may want to check with the resort first. The spa was not first class and they post prices that are negotiable. $90 for a message at quetzal and $27 for one on 5th Ave. I chose the 27 one in town and it was one of the best I'd had - definitely worth it. The advertisments still say they have a seafood restaurant as one of the specialty but it is no longer open which was a disappointment to us. The buffet was definitely normal for an all inclusive - something for all tastes for the most part. Coffee was phenomenal! All in all, ok place for relaxation, better for people with kids than just adults in my opinion.

Let me just start with...WOW! The grounds are beautiful, the beach is amazing, and the drinks are strong! The grounds have lot of wildlife and are basically a jungle with paths through it connecting different areas. They do a wonderful job of cleaning up after both animals and guests and the place is spotless. The food at the beach area buffets was ok (pizza, nachos, and low price buffet food) but the buffet Cozumel near the Quetzal lobby is amazing. It has a fresh squeezed juice bar every morning, a wide variety of foods (shrimp ceviche, fresh fish, and much more). The drinks were very strong and we even had to start asking them to put less liquor in them because 3 drinks were enough. As others have said, the beds are hard but we didn't mind. The rooms were very nice and the maids were awesome with different towel art every day. The nightlife was fun/corny depending on the night. We went to the Mr. Iberostar competition and had a blast. We also heard that the celebrity themed show was good. We never felt the need to tip...the only time we did tip was the beach because its a competitive environment for the waitresses and we noticed tipping kept them coming to us on each of their trips. Make sure you check out the lobby bars when you are there...they have expresso and top shelf liquors and very friendly bartenders. Most of the staff is bilingual to an extent which is very helpful and appreciated. It's about a 1 mile walk to Playa del Carmel or a $5 taxi ride. Make sure you check out playa because 5th avenue is awesome. The wedding We had our wedding here and let me start with the fact that Gabriella is amazing. No request is too small or big for her. The spa is over priced as others have said. The day of my test hairstyle the girl did not do what I asked and I was very stressed out about it. The next day I spoke to the manager and it turned out beautifully. The wedding site was beautifully decorated however it is right on the beach with everyone else so it's not a private site. Our wedding dinner was at the Steakhouse and we were very pleased with the service. They took extra care of us. The groom and I even had our own waiter. We reserved the beach bar and had a dj for our reception and it was perfect. I highly recommend this. Don't rent the disco...rent the beach bar and add the DJ (for cheaper than the disco). Like I said before the whole wedding staff was amazing. The only downside of the wedding was they don't allow outside photographers and I wasn't very pleased with the resort's photographer. They were ok and got some good shots but they missed some very important shots and took a lot of shots with weird angles. Bring a family friend photographer if you know one. Bottom line...loved the resort!

We had a pretty good experience with them. Except....we gave all our room requests at least two weeks in advance through them. I asked if I should email the resort directly and bookit,com said no, the resort would get our requests. Well, of course, when we got there, we certainly weren't offered the room we asked for. The recpetion staffer was very helpful, though, in taking our list and spending a while searching for the room with the list of things we wanted. The room they offered did not have all the things we wanted, but they said mid-stay we could move to one that did. I appreciated the effort at least. Rooms: We loved ours. Our six year old slept on the little sofa they have in each room. We LOVED the shower, I could have stayed all day in there, sorry , we really did go thru the water enjoying that shower. It's a walk in one and the water pressure was great. There is not great storage in the room at all, It would have been nice to have a dresser. We did tip every day and our fridge was stocked every day, not every other like they tell you. We always went back to the room about 10am when our daughter went to kids club and I think we messed up the housekeepers routine, as her cart was at the room next door, but when we'd leave and come back, our room wouldn't be cleaned till close to 4pm, which is what they tell you is possible. It would have been nicer if she came back a little earlier than 4pm. My hubby would take a shower at 5pm or so and sometimes there wasn't hot water, think everyone else showering then too Resort setting: For us, it was perfect. I don't think we would have enjoyed a well-manicured place as much. Just like you read about, there are a ton of animals running around the grounds, it was so much fun for our daughter to watch for them as we walked thru the resort jungle to the beach or buffets. We were in Bldg 25, and I had asked for a jungle side room, as we wanted to watch the animals, but turns out, the first day, a troop of monkeys were in the tree next to our patio, eating. They were so close I could have touched them. One mama even had a tiny little baby. It was amazing. We ended up on the non-jungle side and it worked out fine. They have a staffer who walks around checking on the animals, Saul, I never saw anyone messing with the animals, but I was glad the resort made sure people weren't doing anything stupid. The jungle walk at night on the lit paths is magical, although I'll say they turn off the lights early mornings, so if you are heading to the beach to watch the sunrise, it was a little creepy. Also, the restaurants are all open air except for I think one. This was fine in December, but I kept wondering how miserable it might be in the summer when it was really hot. Beach: We got \"The Letter\" at check-in warning us not to save seats at the beach. Well, like other posts state, if you don't save a seat, there will not be one! They definitely need more beach chairs!! I always went down early to have my quiet time, watch the sunrise and go or a walk, so I didn't feel like I was just throwing down a towel and leaving. But I was so glad I was an early bird and got seats and a hut umbrella for my family. Dragging around beach chairs and setting up an umbrellla is not my idea of relaxing. I noticed at the resorts nearby that there were not towels on all the chairs in the morning like at The Tucan/Quetzal, so either they actually keep enough chairs for their guests or they were way under-booked, which to me seemed unlikely. The beach is BEAUTIFUL. The beach flag was red or yellow each day we were there (early Dec 2010). I would have been curious what a green flag day was like. We brought a life vest for our six year old, and I am so glad we did, we did not have to worry about her as much. Other kids her age did fine in the water without jackets, it just made me feel better having it on her. The water was so warm in the ocean, it was amazing to me. Especially walking early in the morning, when it was kinda chilly, the water was actually warm to walk in. Food: This was the least appreciated part of the stay. If you are a foodie, I don't think you will like this place. However, we did talk to a couple people who loved the food and did not have any problem with it, so there you go. There were a couple times, the food wasn't just marginal, it was spit out of your mouth gross. Specifically, there was what appeared to be small slices of grilled beef at lunch at the beach buffet. But when we bit into it, there was absolutely no texture to it, it wasn't even rubbery, it was like there was nothing inside. Over marinated?? I dunno. I don't even think Resort Kitty, the cat that sneaks into the beach buffet and begs a bit for food, was eating that stuff. I was kinda glad the food wasn't my thing. I didn't gain a ton of weight on vacation. The room service food was not great except they had really great french fries. We got so sick of everything else we would just order a plate of fries. Also they say it will be 30 min but our was always quick, like five minutes. We really enjoyed the japanese place. We were very disappointed with the steakhouse. I would give them a demerit for the reservations system. I waited in line at least a half an hour each time I needed help at that desk. You only have so much time on a vacation, and you don't want to be standing in a line like that. The young woman who worked it most of the time was very even-keel and worked hard to help everyone get what they wanted. Staff: On that note, I watched the staff and most of them did not look very happy to me. I am not talking about the entertainment staff, they were always a thousand miles a minute, to be expected. But everyone else seemed to have to force themselves, or remind themselves to smile. We were treated well, it just made me wonder what it was like to work there. It's one thing to work hard, it's another to be over-worked or expected to do too much in day, or have harsh managers. Just made me wonder. Kids Club: My daugher loved it. It was definitely not my first choice of how I would run it, tho. We really needed some mommy and daddy time, so we sorta held our nose and sent her each day. They have one staffer. They have one little enclosed area with a bathroom, so they spend most of their time elsewhere on the grounds. We were pretty amazed they have no system to notify you if your child needs you etc. You can even go off grounds and they don't care. So you could drop your kid off at 10:15am and not have to see them till 4:30pm. If they were in any kind of distress, it could be a long time till you would know about it. Our daughter was there the whole day, but we would stop by every hour or so and see how she was doing. Okay, so with one staffer, and on the days they had TWENTY ONE kids...using a pool, eating lunch, going to the beach to play in the sand. To me, that was a total disaster waiting to happpen. She had worked the kids club for three years, though, so I guess this system worked so far. We watched them on the beach tho, and she would face the beach not the water. The kids would go into the water and she would not be able to keep her eye on them. I'll admit I'm a first time mama and I'm fussy, I'll leave it to all the other parents to see how they feel about it. I am SO CURIOUS what other kids clubs are like at the other AI's around there. I look back on this vacation as PERFECT because I made it be. I included all the gripes in case things like that would be deal-breakers for other people. It really is a beautful, relaxing place and we would definitely go back, but hoping perhaps the food would improve a bit and they would tweak their kids club set up.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Corpus Christi, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest vacation ever!\u201d", "Author": "361lovebirds", "ReviewID": "UR91765654", "Content": "Iberostar was everything and more than we expected.

Please check reviews of Iberostar Tucan because Iberostar Tucan and Quetzal are in the same complex and management doesnt differentiate between the two. I made a reservation on the Tucan side, but stayed in a room that was on the Quetzal side. I have posted the same review for Tucan. Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal (they are the same hotels in a large complex with one on the left and the other on the right of the complex) is a good choice for those vacationing in Playacar (private ring road of resorts south of the downtown Playa Del Carmen). The resort was very clean and welcoming. There were no peddlars on the private beach and we did not have any sales pitches. We opted for the all inclusive package and would say that it was worth it given the hassle of taking a taxi into town everytime you want to eat. The specialty restaurants are good (our favorite being the Japanese Teppanyaki one) and need a reservation. You should make reservations as soon as you check in since th early slots fill up quickly. The daily buffet can get very repetitive and options for vegetarians are limited to pizza, basic pasta, bread, rice and salad. Mixed drinks are good and the beer is limited to a basic \"light\" beer. We had two young kids (2 1/2 yr old and a 6 month old) and thus did not venture into any tours and activities. There seem to be plenty of things to do within the resort on any given day (water sports, aerobics, yoga, soccer, volleyball, kayaking etc.) coupled with a kids show and normal show at night every day. Even though the hotel rules say that you are not allowed to reserve a hammock or beach chair, everybody seemed to be breaking the rules and putting their blue towels in the morning to reserve a spot. Thus, if you are not a early bird and get to the beach or the pool around 10 or 10 30, you might not be able to find any spots. I am not sure what the solution to this problem is except participating in the problem itself and reserving a beach chair!

But for a family taking four young teens (13-16 years), it's a nice rather low-maintenance getaway, and the free drinks certainly provide a buffer to deal with the teenagers :) The Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan (they are attached and identical and share services) are above average for all inclusives. Food: The buffets provide a lot of variety, and the food is average or slightly above. Don't look for gourmet food, because you won't find it here (although the deserts were quite good!). Food was fresh, always available, and there were hardly any lines. The \"reservation only\" restaurants were ok, but nothing to write home about. We ate at the Italian (not bad) and the Japanese (average). Remember to make your reservations as soon as you arrive as they fill up. Also, there is food available almost 24/7, and the kids found the room service to be quick. Beach: Fabulous, get there early so you can \"reserve\" an unreservable space. Pool: OK, but the beach was where we hung out! Rooms: Beds were ok (yes, just ok), rooms were very clean, bathrooms were clean and the facility in general doesn't look its 14 year old age. I was impressed with how clean it seemed to be overall. Drinks: Bars were good. The \"swim up\" bar is not part of the main pool area (it is a separate pool), and it's limited to adults only. This is a good and bad thing :) We found that during the day at the beach there were three bars open - the two buffets and the beach bar. Once in a while there was a line, but for the most part the service was quick. Since everyone loves blended drinks it just takes time. Giving the bartenders a dollar or two helps them remember you, and makes sure they make you good drinks. Lobby bars (there is one in each hotel) were also good with good service, but could be a little slow during prime hours. Room is stocked with beer and soft drinks in the minibar. Dive shop staff was outstanding. Overall, the service and people were very good. If it was only my wife and I, I wouldn't do an all-inclusive. I find the day to day buffets boring and enjoy going to different restaurants. But with a family, especially with kids that are somewhat independent, it's a very relaxing vacation. The Iberostar was better and less pretentious than the overpriced Barcelo we stayed at, and definitely better than the neighboring Riu which we also stayed at.

It was bland and was alot of the same day after day. Staying 7 days gets you 2 dinner reservations- pretty disapointing! The restaurants were ok, better than the same buffet. We ate at the Japanese and the Mexican. The Mexican restaurant waiter we' had was the only staff member we didn't care for the entire time.

We had so much fun venturing around after the sun set. The beach was so amazing as well. The whitest and softest sand and clear turquiose water made this stretch of beach well worth the trip alone. The rooms are more of a 3 star, in my opinion. Clean but the stucco walls and hard beds were a little disappointing. But, after a full day swimming and being in the sun we fell asleep as soon as our heads hit the pillow. The swimming pools were cool, but under that hot sun, a treat. Everything was so well taken care of. Please tip the servers and employees well. They are so hard working and truly deserve the extra cash. Nothing is expected. So, when you do tip, they are so appreciative. The food was very good. We had the Japanese and Streakhouse a la carte. They were so yummy.

We travelled with our 4 year old daughter and she loved it here. Our first family vacation tropical and an amazing experience. The night life and hotel entertainment were very entertaining. The kids hour at 8:30 pm was a treat for our daughter. She loved dancing under the disco lights. Our second last day we were offered to stay at the LINDO for free as our last night.

Our room was cleaned by noon time every day. Our refrig was well stocked and one request was enough to keep extra water and diet coke in it all eleven nights of our visit. We ate at the Japanese which was ok. The food was good but our chef was probably new and not very entertaining. We ended up watching the activity at another table. The Steakhouse was our favorite and we ate there twice. One thing that made it special was our \"singing waiter\" Nataneal. He never stops smiling and is always so happy. He obviously loves his job.

Although the weather wasn't great and we had some rainy days with the red flag out it was still so nice sitting there under the palapa with a good book.

The down side to this is there is no sleeping in as the animals are up with the sun........mother natures alarm clock. They have a swim up bar that I think they should rename \"The Canadian Swim-up Bar\" as the water is so cold only Canadians will go in there!!!!! Not many people would go down in there, it's a really cool location but the water needs to be heated!!! As far as the room's, just like everyone said in previous review's, beds are hard as rock!!!!!

But can someone please tell me where you can rent a vehical that isnt a bucket of bolts & will make it around the island? My first dune buggy never made it out of town & the second wasnt much better.........maybe thats the way it is over there!!!!

After reading the negative reviews prior to going again in Oct 2010 we were a little worried !! Well all I can say is that they must be about another Hotel !! Nothing had changed it is still great and perhaps a little better. The Staff are very very friendly , the place is spotless.We could honestly find nothing to moan about (and I like a good moan!!) Ok the beds are hard, but after an exhausting day spent on the beach doing nothing we still slept like babies. The style of the decor is a little dated in the bedrooms, but the hotel has been open for over 10 years and this is more of an observation rather than a criticism, and we only used the room for showering and sleeping. They have done major work on the beach since last year and it is now much wider. The sand whales have also gone(put there to try and stop beach errosion) The sand although white is a little course (ground shells) in places. We are beach people, and were up very early so we had no problem getting shade and beds, and the area where we were on the beach still had beds and shade at 10am!. The food was very good (I put on 5lbs !!!) and we only ate in the buffet once , managing to eat in the speciality restaurants every night probably because they hotels were only 60% occupied. We ate everything, salads are washed in perfectly safe water , we never got ill. Only felt iffy the once and that was my own doing ! We loved the japanease which was the best one, and really good fun. The waiters in there were not slow in filling your glasses !! The Italian one was good (try the Lamb Chops), Steak House good (Rib Eye /Medium delicious) Mexican ok . We ate in the beach buffett every morning for breakfast because we prefered to eat later (probably because we had a big mug of tea and fresh baked pastries from the same buffet at 7am!!) Men only have to wear long trousers in the closed in restaurants. The Steak Bar is open so they dont have to wear them in there. They also do beach barbecues etc, but they usually were around 12.30pm and we were not hungry then. We did not see any of the Entertainment, because we have been before and it is more or less the same. The Bars are not that big and can get a bit busy until everyone moves on to eat or watch the entertainment. Drinks are normal strength, let me tell you !! speaking as a complete lightweight I know they are not watered down. Wine at dinner Red/White is perfectly drinkable. If you want Rose or a little better, they now have a wine list and you can order from this, a bottle of Rose worked out to be about \u00a315. They also serve \"Champagne\" (Cava !!) Which is ok, If you will be celebrating a special Occasion take your own, as a bottle of the real stuff will cost you \u00a3100 The Spa treatments are round about the same price as in the UK. The wildlife is amazing here, on the way back from the room in the middle of the day , I came across an Iguanna who I named Godzilla (he was roughly the same size too !!) He was basking in the sun, by the pool where Basketball is played. I did not go that way again !! Did not see the Monkeys (heard them !!) The Weather was perfect, considering the time of year. Although we had a note pushed through our door asking us to stay in our room until 10am the next day because of hurricane Paula They were expecting very heavy rain and strong guts of wind !! and that is just how they spelt it. We were quite reassured by this but nothing happened and it was just some rain and not much wind. HINTS AND TIPS The Departure Tax in Mexican Pesos is 660 each The Men at Cancun airport in smart beige Trousers and blue shirts ARE NOT with Thomas Cook or any other agency (Travel reps are not allowed in the Terminal and will be waiting outside with directions to your transfer) they are TIMESHARE. Take mosquito stuff - Industrial Strength !! Take high factor Sun protection, you are much nearer to the Equator than in the Med and you will fry even on a cloudy day ( I used factor 30 and still came away with a nice tan) Dont touch the Ice Cream (Instant weight gain guaranteed, it will go straight on your hips) It is absolutely Fab !!

We've now stayed at 6 different resorts in the Playa area, and the Iberostar resorts are our favorite. Let me start out by saying, however, if you're looking for a great swim-up bar, Iberostar Quetzal is probably not the resort for you (Iberostar Cozumel has a GREAT swim-up bar if that's your thang!). The swim-up bar pool at Quetzal is very small and separate from the main pool. We don't care about this, so it was fine with us. As with all the resorts we've stayed at, we started getting a little tired of the buffet food after 5-6 days, but we always found something to eat. Always! We ordered room service a couple of times, and the food arrived very quickly, and it was good. Speciality restaurants...steak, Japanese and Mexican were all good. We didn't try the other ones. We like how you can make reservations for the specialty restaurants all at one time. The last resort we stayed at (Sandos Playacar), you had to stand in line every morning for 45 minutes to make a reservation for that day only. Staff is very friendly at IB Quetzal, and they work hard to make everyone happy. We tipped the entire trip...people who clean the rooms, every meal, room service, every bar...and it is very much appreciated. Absolute best staff member we met was Victor in the lobby bar. We went there every morning after breakfast for a latte' (\"coffee with steamed milk\"). Victor was such a sweetheart, and my 9-year old loved to sit and talk and talk and talk with him. A very nice guy! The beach is beautiful at this resort. Plenty of chairs and palapas. Pool is nice. My daughter loved the entertainment shows every night. The ride into downtown Playa is $5, but we don't care for all the vendors trying to get you to buy their \"stuff.\" One guy even got rude with me when I didn't want to pay $10 for something he had marked $2, and the resort gift shop had the very same item for $3. We arranged beforehand for a private car to take us to/from the resort from/to the airport, and it was well worth the money. You might want to check on your outgoing flight before you leave the resort...we didn't find out until we got to the airport that our flight going home was canceled.", "Date": "October 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201cWould stay here again...\u201d", "Author": "ipcooks", "ReviewID": "UR85243702", "Content": "Originally, we had booked to stay at Viva Wyndham, but somehow, when we got there, they had bumped us to the Iberostar.

From the minute we arrived at Cancun airport---where we met Steve Tyler from Aerosmith, yeah that's right---to the 45 minute ride to our hotel, we had that feeling this was going to be a great time. Having stayed at the Iberostar hotels in Punta Cana, with their best-ever beaches, we had high hopes for this stay. To say it was wonderful, is an understatement. We knew what our type of vacation we were seeking and boy, did this place live up to and exceed expectations. If you want fancy columns and must-dress up status, this is not your place. If you want a great location---a middle section that had a mini-jumgle full of wildlike, monkeys, iguanas, etc included, with great food, casual atmosphere, a huge pool, 5 restaurants and some of the friendliest folks working there we've ever come across, then this is your place. My wife Joy and I have been to a number of Caribbean locations and this exceeded all and rivaled Punta Cana. Reasonably priced, no hard beds like I saw reportd, great food, plenty to do, beautiful newly-refurbished beach and 85degree water, the Ibostar brand is one we will stick with for a long time. They do it right! We were told when we got down to Mexico that we had picked one of the \"best places\" down there, well guess what, those folks were right.

We have found these hotels to be the best for a truly restful and relaxing vacation. We went to the Quetzal for 10 days and returned on 10-24. The food at this resort is more European than the other IB's I have been to in Mexico. Although we were there for 10 days, we only went to 2 of the specialty restaurants; the Mexican (the buffet's Mexican food was much better) and the Japanese (very good). We enjoyed the buffets since they offer something for everyone and allowed me to eat at about the same time every night, which I prefer to do, for medical reasons. The other guests consisted of more Europeans and South Americans than people from the USA and/or Canada, which really gives you an opportunity to meet some interesting people from somewhat different cultures. The beach is terrific and there were plenty of lounges available by the beach and pool. The staff there work extremely hard and this is a resort where they seem really concerned that their guests have a good time. I cannot rate the shows because we didn't really go, but often enough there was music by the bar in the evening. There was a mariachi group playing in the restaurants occasionally, but I wish they had more traditional Mexican music, especially at the beach in the afternoons; it would have been really relaxing. There are fancier hotels with more gourmet food and bigger pools, but I doubt there is any place with more beautiful grounds or which are more pleasant in which to unwind.

My kids really enjoyed calling the monkeys and visiting with the animals. There are several restaurants to choose from. The steak house and Mexican where my favorite.

We spent 9 wonderful days here. The service in general is great, everybody is really friendly and helpful. - The rooms are ok., only needed to sleep, shower and change. Mattresses are not as comfortable but due to all the daily activities (even if that meant reading and drinking mojitos on a deckchair!!) I slept really well. - Make sure your room is near the beach. Walking is good but going back and forth in case you need to do whatever in your room gets tedious. - Free drinks (water, sodas - Coke, Sprite -, beer) in the little fridge are appreciate it. - The pool is like any other pool, big and spacious. Although I spent 99% of the time at the beach. - Speaking of which... lovely beach... calm, white sand. Really nice. Definitely a PLUS. - If anything, my only 'BUT' would be the food. It's not bad, but it's not good either. Comparisons are odious.. however, having stayed last year at the Iberostar in Punta Cana, where the food was amazing, needless to say, I was very disappointed. Presentation and variety (food and fruits) were the main issue for me. Not many fruits to choose from. Juices were watery, coffee tasted awful (we'd ask for espressos each time, in order to have our waiter brew fresh coffee instead of that horrible-for-everybody flask coffee). It wasn't all bad but again, it can be improved. - Like every other resort, they offer 4 or 5 specialty restaurants, where you need to make a reservation. In this particular hotel, the best one was the Japanese, it's Benihana style. It surprised me of how good it was. Second best? it's a tie between the Caribbean style restaurant and the Italian. - Again, like other resorts, you can enjoy different types of activities one hour per day for free (kayaking, sailing, snorkeling (although there's nothing but sand)) - There are so many excursions and day trips to choose from, but I highly recommend Xplore (obviously, you need to do all the cultural visits first! Chichen Itz\u00e1, Tulum, etc) - Having Playa del Carmen so close by is such an advantage. To walk around town, to go shopping, to have dinner, to go to an ATM, to have drinks, etc. - Last but not least, you can visit Cozumel (there you can snorkel really cheap for about 2 hours, nice views, lots of different fish) and then the rest of the day after waking around downtown Cozumel, you can enjoy a day in the Iberostar Cozumel as a guest as well. Just take an ID and with your bracelet on and just relax, have more drinks, go to the pool bar, etc. Downside: The ride to/from the port costs approx. $20 each way (it's a fixed rate) Enjoy your stay, disconnect and have a good time!!", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "MINNESOTA", "Title": "\u201cWonderful resort ~ fun time spent with my girlfriends!\u201d", "Author": "MCCOLW", "ReviewID": "UR82635588", "Content": "Spent five nights at this resort with my girlfriends for a 40th birthday celebration.

Teenagers would like to go back without parents\u201d", "Author": "thebeadinglady", "ReviewID": "UR78151654", "Content": "We stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal from August 20-27, 2010 (we are a family of 6, 2 teenagers and two 11 year old children). At the beginning stage of planning this trip and reading some of the other reviews staying at the Quetzal was a concern. We have stayed at the Iberostar in Punta Cana and Playa Dorada both in the Dominican Republic and are used to the high quality of service, immaculate grounds and great food provided in those locations. *Transportation to Hotel: We booked a private van through Lomas Travel (lomastravel.com), very affordable and no waste of time dropping off other passengers at different hotels. *Arrival in Cancun Airport: As soon as we cleared customs, Lomas agents are all uniformed waiting with signs. Since we didn't see our name, we approached them and they had a list with all names and directed us to the van that would take us to the hotel. Otherwise expect to get bombarded by baggage crew trying to carry your luggage just a few feet away. Be aware also of some crew trying to sell you time shares or excursions. *Temperature in Cancun: oppressive! It's not just the heat, but the humidity in August was suffocating. No one's fault but mother nature. Only blame it on us for traveling at the end of August. *Trip to Hotel: uneventful! straight highway, no picturesque mountains. The driver can only do max speed of 80 km per hour. All vehicles with this company are set not to exceed any higher speed. *Hotel location: about 50 minutes away from the airport depending on traffic.The hotel is located within a gated community called \"PLAYACAR\". In the community there are a whole bunch of other hotels, private homes, condos and time shares. The largest and most impressive hotel from the outside being Riu. *Checking in time: 3:00 p.m. We got to the hotel around 1:30 p.m and of course our rooms were not ready. We all got our wrist bands and proceeded to go to the buffet restaurant by the pool area. Our first impression in terms of the food having been at other Iberostar is that there was not a big selection, but hey let's not complain we just got here. I found the Chicken Cordon Bleu, out of this world, red snapper and grouper if you like fish was also great! aside from salad bar. You will always find something to eat, but by the end of the week, it gets repetitive. We had lunch again at this restaurant the next day, by the third day we headed to the main Buffet Restaurant on the Tucan side. *WARNING: This time of the year is considered low season. The hotel was at 60% capacity, from now until December everything goes down the hill, cut down on employees, main buffet restaurant on the Quetzal side was CLOSED. Even though we stayed at the Quetzal side, we had to walk to the Tucan side for breakfast, lunch or dinner if we didn't have reservations at one of the specialty restaurant (mirror hotel basically you have Tucan on one side, Quetzal on the other). *Lobbies have basically the same look, except the corridors on the Quetzal side are 6\" wooden planks. Ladies DO NOT wear high heel sandals or shoes if you are staying on this side of the hotel, otherwise you'd have to walk like a 2 year old on your tippy toes. *The Tucan side has all shiny marble floors and certainly gives a more modern look. On the Tucan side the Reception area has the Mayan hieroglyphics on the walls and you will find the same beautiful stones with Mayan symbols through out their corridors. You will also see a bird by the name of \"The Quetzal\" very colorful (why not have them on the Quetzal side would only makes sense). On the Quetzal side Angels and Saints seems to be the theme. The reception area has a complete different look with religious paintings and cracked finish. They have a different bird less colorful in Spanish is called \"Cotorra\", they will repeat anything you say, so watch your mouth!. Gigantic Angels adorned the lobby by the entrance and wicker chairs and love seats are spread through out. *Rooms: Building 20 on the Quetzal side (Junior Suites) is the only ocean front and is close to the pool and beach, very far from the lobby and all other specialty restaurants except \"The Steakhouse\". Building 21, 22 & 23 are also close to the pool. We stayed in Building 22 facing the Jungle. Did not have any problems, our air condition was nice and cold, yes the beds are mounted in concrete slabs, so what?t, less shaking. We had no problem sleeping, firm mattresses are good for your back. The Monkeys did not interrupt our sleep, you have to be in the buildings located closer to the jungle to perhaps be bothered by the howling. Yes, when we walked to the Restaurant for breakfast, we could hear them, they are very loud. Our remote control was not working on arrival and it took them 2 days to change it. So at night, we had to get off our __ to change the TV like in the old days when there was no remote around. A minor inconvenience, we were so exhausted by 11:00 that there was little time to watch T.V. anyway. Breakfast: Everyday served at the only restaurant open on the Tucan side. Atmosphere: Not lavish as other Iberostar, we are used to the grand displays, and this hotel lack of that. COMPLAIN: the food was always COLD. no matter what, not even the heat lamps are keeping the food warm enough. I ended up getting egg omelet almost everyday, it was the only thing I could get warm. DANIEL was always very pleasant making them. Kudos to him for standing the heat. Can't say enough good things about our waitress and waiter almost everyday during breakfast. Elsy (only female waitress around at this restaurant) and Jorge, very nice people, hard workers and always with a smile accommodating my family. Ask for coffee from the machine is much better than the carafe sitting there. *Tipping\": This is an all inclusive, and yes everything is included. We brought plenty of singles and even though the waiters do not ask for anything and do their job with a smile, they are so appreciative and go the extra mile to please when you acknowledge their work with some green. This is Mexico, as bad as the economy is in the U.S., is worst here, they don't make the kind of money that vacationers make. Drinks: We are not big on drinking, but love our virgin Pina Colada or Frozen Daiquiris with no alcohol. Best ones at the lobby bar on the Quetzal side also while dining at the Japanese Restaurant. Everywhere else you have to specify very frozen otherwise it would be very liquidy. *Specialty Restaurants: We made reservations at the \"Public Relations\" desk on day of arrival. Be aware that is only open in the morning until 12 noon and then in the afternoon they open at 4:00 p.m again. I made reservations for the Japanese, Italian, & Mexican, but was able to get one at the last minute for the Steakhouse. \"Japanese\" Restaurant Habashi style: ate there twice, excellent food great show put by the chef and best Pina colada. Always packed, I think is the most popular of all the restaurants. Sitting hours vary, but usually starts at 6:30 p.m. Air conditioned! Yeah! \"Italian\": Most refined in decor. Can't complain about the food, I know other reviewers have compared it to Chef Boy Ardee. I had Salmon and it was great, and this is coming from someone who is somewhat a picky eater and likes to eat well and quality food. Traveling with 2 teenagers and other children there would always be one in the crowd, but no one complained. \"Mexican\": Got what I wanted since I checked in at this hotel. Finally a trio of Mariachis walked in and I basically called them to our table and they sang what I asked them to sing. My kids were embarrassed that I was ready to join them in singing. We had not seen The Mexican theme or singers anywhere else in the hotel. The food was fabulous! Also air conditioned. \"Steakhouse\" Our least favorite, believe it or not! We love meat, but it was a very hot and humid night (what else is new), we had 1more of our kids joining us for dinner that night and the waiter was out of his element, trying to get another table setting. The salad bar ran out of everything, and took them a very long time to replenish. By the time food was replenish at the salad bar, our main course was coming out. WARNING: This is the only specialty restaurant with no air condition, so if you go to the buffet restaurant at night is the same thing. \"The Tropical\" was closed during our stay so we were not able to eat there obviously. *Pool: I can't speak when the hotel is in full capacity during other times of the year, but during our stay, there were always chairs available. I am an early riser, and would go for a beach walk to see the beautiful sunrise. Of course I would take the opportunity to set my towels on whatever chair or palapa at that point. Is true (Palapas are only 4) chances are unless you get up really early you are no going to get one. My husband didn't care for them anyway, we had one 1 day, got it again on a second day and we gave it away. By the time we returned from an excursion later in the day we got chairs as usual around the same pool that gets crowded with children. The water is very warm and it feels like a jacuzzi, but then is August in Mexico. For some adults complaining about the pool getting too crowded, the pool is gigantic, they can move to another side towards the center which is a bit deeper (not meant for children). But if you want to stay in the more shallow area, then Houston we have a problem!. *Adult Pool\" : You got to be 18 to be there, if you have small children wishful thinking! plus is always packed with a young crowd trying out all kinds of different drinks and being louder than the monkeys. Didn't looked too clean, mainly leaves dropping from the trees and yes what do you expect from young adults drinking. Our teenagers loved this pool and was the meeting point for other youngsters. They met kids from Canada, England, Spain and many other places. I'm sure soon to be friends on Facebook if not already. \"Beach\": For those comparing this beach of Playacar/ Riviera Maya as is called to Cancun because they remember the sandy beaches and blue turquoise water, you got to know that hurricane Wilma a few years ago washed out all that beautiful sand and the government had to bring sand from the middle of the ocean to replenish the sand on Cancun beaches. I had visited Cancun and Playa del Carmen 15 years ago. It is not the same. Once I got over the broken shells and the dropped of a few feet when first entering the ocean, the water was delicious and the sand was fine, didn't feel any alggeas. Yes I have seen more beautiful beaches than this one including the ones in the Dominican Republic such as Punta Cana and Las Terrenas or Trunks Bay in St. John, Megan's Bay in St. Thomas, I can keep going on and on. I also have seen worst. *Entertainers\": Where do I start? Edu, Luigi, Paul, Pablo, Mauricio, Harry Potter, Michelle (with the mini club) and others that probably I'm forgetting. what a wonderful bunch of energetic, enthusiastic, friendly people. They work so hard to keep everyone happy and please the crowd. Does anyone know how difficult it is to make people happy? Just look around yourselves. People from all over the world, from different walks of life, customs, what pleases one, doesn't pleases the other. They try. During the day, I understand the rules are not to play any music until 10:00 a.m. Sometimes they start playing 1 song and then the song gets cut off, I guess they have their routine. I still have Dale P'Aqui, Dale P'alla in my head, and forget about \"Hey Baby\" the theme song around the pool everyday. No matter how hard they try, some people didn't want to be bother dancing or moving, I almost fell sorry for the entertainers. Paul the new choreographer was great! very amusing in keeping conversation with me and my husband. Such a gentleman and great dancer. Edu was awesome too. Very impressive how many languages they all speak. \"Night Shows\" The female and male singer are amazing! The band/orchestra is phenomenal! and the staff really tries putting a nice show for the tourist. The shows could be a bit early by 9:00 p.m. for my taste they played too much cumbia and salsa before the shows, but not everyone likes Merengue as much as I do. \"Activities\" I did Stretching (even got my hubby to do it with me), Merengue and Salsa lessons, Bingo, Scuba diving in the pool, swimming, walking on the beach. There are many activities for those who'd like to be a bit active, otherwise no one forces you to do anything you don't want to do. Beach party on Wednesdays. The chefs will make Paella Valenciana (no seafood) and Paella Marinera (with seafood). Sangria was also serve and the DJ played amazing music. All the youngsters would be the only ones who remained dancing in the sun. *Playa Del Carmen\" $US5. dollars for a taxi from the hotel or back and it will take 5 minutes to get there. What a difference when I visited 15 years ago there was no cobble stones open pedestrian mall with McDonalds, Burger King, Carlos & Charlies, Haaggendaz and every other vendor you can think of. Vendors will call you to come in to their stores, but will leave you alone if you are not interested. DO NOT pay full price for anything unless you walk into Swarosvky or the likes. All the other jewelry stores and gift shops are used to haggling with the prices unless they are clearly marked and do not accept any discounts. BE AWARE of silver pieces that are not! They are called Alpacas like the animals and it's a fake silver. All silver pieces are supposed to be marked 925 with a stamp or 999 is the much better and exclusive pieces. Excursions: We booked Tulum Express and Chichen Itza to visit the ruins, prepaid before we left home through Lomas. Even though on the web it says they will pick you up at the hotel from any hotel in Riviera Maya, they will not. There is a meeting point about 3 minutes walk from the hotel in a little shopping plaza. The bus to Tulum was late and on top of that they took us to other meeting points and hotels to pick up other passengers. If we had to do it all over again we would take a cab from the hotel and go at our leisure, is only about 1/2 hour, but I speak Spanish, if you don't feel comfortable, just go with the flow and take the guided tour as we did. On the way back the drop off was outside the entrance of the hotel, didn't even bothered driving to the front of hotel lobby. STAY AWAY from LAPIZ Jewelry Center (located in Tulum and also Cancun). As soon as the bus arrives in Tulum that is the first stop. It is a tourist trap!. I looked at a bracelet and later on matching necklace, asked the sales rep for the price he told me US$250 for the set, called his supervisor to confirm who called another supervisor and then when they saw that I was really interested in both the price changed to US$1800 for the necklace only. Things happens for a reason. I did not buy anything from them as found their business practice shady. When I came home and research no official website for a company that large, and the blogs, it's a horror story what I read. I am so glad, didn't get taken for a ride, but do have to say I didn't see the same necklace or bracelet anywhere else. So I'll give them that. *Chichen-Itza* Was truly an amazing site, and definitely if you have the time go and visit. door to door the tour was 12 hours. It takes 2 1/2 hours just to get there from the hotel in Riviera Maya (again picked up at the meeting point), 2 1/2 hours back, 1 hour having lunch at a very typical \"Hacienda\" where they have colorful dancers doing a routine with beer bottles and glasses on a tray in their head; another hour at 1 of the 3,200 cenotes or in-ground rivers (lagoons type) there are in Mexico and 3 hours on the site, plus the time spent dropping off at different hotels. What a shame that the government has allowed so many vendors inside of what should be considered sacred grounds. What a distraction! This trip included transportation, buffet luncheon, and guided tour. The Guide Gina and the Host Mary were great. Fed everyone from continental breakfast in the morning, plenty of drinks, water, beer, snacks. Even an umbrella when we got to the site just in case, and you know what? it did rain. Unfortunately the umbrella had such a musty moldy smell that it was not worth using it. During the stop at the Cenote, there is a cooperative jewelry store. All the items sold here are legitimate 925 silver and 18 kt gold hand made by artisans and helps the Mayan community still living in the area. Prices for custom name tags written in Mayan are all set, so don't expect to bargain. Overall the IBEROSTAR QUETZAL/TUCAN offers beautiful grounds with all kind of living creatures walking around like monkeys, iguanas, flamingos, turtoise, turtles, agouti (official name for the weird animal that looks like a grown up rat) and is all over the place, clean rooms, and there is lots of walking. If you have elderly in the family or anyone with walking problems, not the place to be. Otherwise my daughter didn't want to leave, until I told her she would have to attend school with Mexican children who would only speak Spanish. Our Teenagers would like to go back without us.

Big mistake!! This hotel is VERY kid oriented with lots of families. The pool each day had so many kids playing and splashing, you couldn't really float around and relax. This wouldn't have been a bad thing if we had brought kids as well, but we came to enjoy a nice week together to relax, kid free. As in other reviews, yes the pool is very warm, but it did not really bother us. By the end of each day, you can see a film of sunscreen and God knows what else on top of the water, but I wouldn't go under water so I didn't worry about it. As in other reviews, the pool gets very crowded, very early. There are only 4 palapas (cabana beds) by the pool and they always filled up 1st. I was determined to have one so I woke up at 5:45am one morning and just went back to sleep in it until my husband woke up. There are plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas but the later you wait, the less chance you have of finding a couple together. And yes, people do reserve chairs/ palapas early when they are supposedly not allowed. The Staff were, indeed, friendly, however never knew the answers to our questions. The Refrigerator was really warm, and eventually stopped working all together in our room and when we called it took them over 2 hours to respond. Finally they fixed it, but it was still a little warm. The rooms do not get cleaned until later in the day, but again, that wasn't a concern for us. We didn't spend any time in the room anyway, other than to sleep. The beds are on a concrete slab, but we took the advice of other reviewers and asked for a foam pad. It really helped a lot and we were so exhausted from being in the sun all day that we slept fine. And we NEVER heard the peacocks and monkeys in the morning hours. Maybe we had a good location for our room or were too tired to care, but it was not an issue in the least for us! The grounds are very beautiful. My husband and I saw monkeys several times, peacocks, flamingos, turtles, koi fish, roosters, tucans, huge iguanas, little rodents that are called Tzurques but they look like a rat/rabbit/squirrel so we affectionately called them \"scrabbits\" :) The jungle is very neat however somewhat confusing to get around and not very well lit up at night so you had to really watch where you were going. It's a bit of a shock when you first get there seeing all the animals among you, but by the end of the trip, you don't even think twice about passing one. They don't bother anyone in the least. The beach was the most disappointing part for me. When I think of Cancun, I think of crystal clear water and white soft sandy beaches. This is not the case here. The water was really dirty. I could've went to a lake and had clearer water. The waves were a bit rough, but that is fun for kids and people body surfing. The beach its self has a lot of shell pieces and wasn't what I expected. My husband and I walked down the beach over a mile (as per another reviewer recommended for a lagoon). Do NOT do this. It was very hot and the farther you walk, the dirtier the beach gets with trash and what not and we never found a lagoon. The food wasn't the greatest. What they had left over from one buffet would just be served at the next. You can always find SOMETHING to eat, so you won't starve, but we did not like the buffets what so ever. And there is no air conditioning pretty much throughout the resort other than your rooms, so you will sweat your butt off eating as there is little to no air flow around all the hot buffets. We did get to go to 3 specialty restaurants (for each 7 days you stay, you get 3 guarenteed specialty reservations) We ate at Mexican, Italian, and Steakhouse. Hands down the Mexican was the best. We are not even big mexican eaters, but it was fantastic! Italian, to me, tasted like Chef Boyardee. Steakhouse was really good as well...I got the pork chops. The entertainment was ok. They have kids club activities until the shows at 930pm so by that time you're so tired you can barely stay awake. I wish they would've been a little earlier. The drinks are very poor. The liquor is very low quality. I tried several drinks and never finished one. The Mai Tai was the best drink and still was just medicore. If you're not picky about drinks and just want to get drunk, then this won't be an issue for you! Overall, I don't think I would recommend this hotel to my friends. There are too many better options of resorts to stay at in Mexico. It would be a fun resort for kids...but still not somewhere I would return to. Here are some tips for your stay: *Request buildings 22,23,24,25 for best location in terms of beach and restaurants. We stayed in 23 and it couldn't have been more perfect. *Bring insulated cups (we brought 32 oz bubba kegs) and you are able to fill them up with sodas or the bartender doesnt mind mixing drinks for it *Bug Spray! We got ate up with Mosquitos. *To call home, BUY THE CARD AT THE RESORT. They are the only calling cards that work with the resort pay phones. We thought we would save money going into town to buy one, but they don't work with the resort pay phones and you still have to pay the $5 connecting fee everytime you call out. *Get up Early to get your chairs or you won't chairs together! *Check in time is STRICTLY 3pm. You will sit and wait until then if you get there early. *Book your dinner reservations when you get there (desk is across from check in, easy to find!) and then on the days you have no reservations, go to desk again at 4pm and you can almost always get an extra reservation for that night. *Water was safe to drink in the restaurants/buffets but had to use a jug of water to brush your teeth. And be careful showering...hold your mouth closed! Faucet water is NOT safe. *Go into town! Taxi cabs are $5 (50 pesos) and go to 5th Avenue (playa del carmen). We went on a Saturday night and it is so fun! There are tons of shops and culture. They had music and fire dancers. Very worth the trip.

Everything was wonderful, the beach is exquisite, great food, perfect atmosphere -- would love to go back in a heartbeat. Can't say enough great things about this hotel or the staff. I had a palapa massage that was second-to-none. The rooms are wonderful and nicely decorated. Sinks drain slowly in the bathroom but this isn't a complaint as I'm sure it can't be helped. If you are looking for a magical atmosphere that is really affordable, stay here. This is my 4th trip to Playacar and by far my best experience. I have stayed at more expensive hotels and was not nearly as satisfied. The way the development is literally built into the existing jungle is unique and brilliantly done. I think this is the place to go for the time of your life, and it would be very difficult to find anything to complain about here. Get up early in the morning and watch the peacocks and the monkeys while you sip your coffee on your balcony.

We decided to stay in this one because we thought we'd want to be closer to Playa del Carmen, and we wanted to try a new one. In the end we went into town only once, so it wasn't worth the crowds or the extra money. The resorts themselves are quite similar architecturally. They are laid out the same with two identical hotels on either side. We felt like we were at the same hotel. There is a shared pool in the center with matching breakfast/lunch buffets on either side of the beach. We liked that everything is close together in the Quetzal/ Tucan. However the pool is bigger and better at the the Paraiso, and the beach is cleaner with clearer water and less crowded. The pool at the Quetzal was deep and not nearly as big. For kids the Paraiso pool is superior because it had a few levels so you weren't always swimming. There is only one swim up bar. As I recall, there were several at the Paraiso. The rooms are the same, but the Paraiso there was more room. Sadly the beach is not so great. There are a lot of hotels and the water can get clouded up. It smells like diesel fuel from all the jet skis. If you are out of town, say at the Paraiso, the water is clearer and there are fewer jet skis to stink up the place. The down side to the Paraiso is that it is quite large and there is definitely more walking from place to place. The evening buffets were about the same. The Paraiso had bar service in the main buffets. Quetzal did not. I would recommend the Quetzal if you are planning to go out at night in Playa. You'll want to be close. You might also like the Quetzal because there are more people. There are about ten all inclusive hotels right next to each other, so there is more people watching to be done. But if you're not so into that and you don't mind a bit more walking the Paraiso was much nicer.

Beach chairs - You will have to get up between 6 am - 7 am to reserve a beach chair. 2. Beach towel service - Towel service supposed to open up at 8 am. Stood in line for towels from 8:00- 8:20 and no one arrived to hand out the precious towels - had to get out of the long line to check on my young son that was sleeping when I left. To my horror he was not in the room when I returned - I contacted several staff people that my son was missing - no one would help but one guy did follow me around. A guest at the resort found my son and brought him to our room - God Bless her. 3. Wristbands - Realized after dining at one restaurant that the waiter was serving my daughters alcohol throughout dinner after I told him they were underage and NOT to serve them alcohol and they had wristbands indicating they were underage. 4, Walkways - When it rains the stone walkways are extremely slippery - one woman broke her ankle. Use the cement walkways on the far sides when it rains. 5. Staff in general were not friendly and actually somewhat insulting - most all the staff will call you \"Lady\". I was pretty sick of being called \"Lady\" after a day. Managers here are even ruder - they rule the roost and there is not point in having a discussion with them if you have a problem. If you don't like something - you can leave as far as they are concerned. We chose this resort because one of my son's loves monkeys - never saw a single monkey. Resort was so crowded around the pool area that it was not relaxing. So many chairs crammed next to each other on the beach that it was not very relaxing either. To navigate or weave around the pool area was not easy - tons of people everywhere - was like an obstacle course.

We booked Cancun Transfers for private transport to and from the resort/airport. They were on time and we were a party of 8. NOTE TO FIRST TIME CANCUN VISITORS: Upon leaving customs you WILL be approached by any number of solicitors asking you were you are staying and claiming to have your transport to your resort. They are only there to hand you off to a taxi or transport service for a commission. Pre-arrange your own transport if you can. ALSO, porters will attempt to grab your luggage at any opportunity, again, unless you need the help, I'd hold on to your own luggage - the walk to the transport/taxi area is less than a 100 yards. We arrived at the resort, beautiful lobby. We stayed in building 29, which was the farthest from the beach however we found it be convenient to the evening activities, lobby bar at fitness center/tennis courts. Hotel- This is an open air hotel, and check-in is at 3:00. If you want to change before your room is ready, I highly recommend the bathrooms in the lobby which are big and air-conditioned. There is limited air conditioning in public areas. The staff is friendly and helpful and the \"Star Friends\" (which run all the entertainment) go out of there way to make sure you are having a great time. Food- The only negatives to the food was that there are no air conditioned breakfast or lunch options, although we always grabbed burgers and buffet items by the beach which was fine. For all the of the sit downs restaurants you must make a reservation. Our favorites in order were the Italian, Mexican, Japanese, then the Tropical. We never got a chance to eat at the Steakhouse but we heard it was very good. Beach and Pool- The pool is very large but there is no swim up bar. The adult pool, which has a swim up bar, is not worth visiting due to its location and cleanliness. The beach is fantastic. There are plenty of chairs and huts. But depending on how crowded the resort is you may need to get up early (6:30) to reserve one (although technically not permitted, everyone reserves.) Additional umbrellas are offered through the towel shack, as well as beach games. This beach is one of the nicest we have been to in Mexico. Facing the ocean, if you walk about a mile to the right, there is a beautiful, some what secluded natural lagoon style beach. It was a nice walk with beautiful vistas. Another note on the beach, you will be approached by a number of traveling vendors, most are very friendly and will leave you alone if you are not interested. Although some offer great deals. DO NOT BUY CIGARS OFF THE BEACH - poor quality and imitation cuban. Activities- There are plenty of activities on and off the resort. We highly recommend visiting downtown Playa del Carmen for a couple of hours during your stay. It is only a $5(US) cab ride there. There are high end stores-to-street vendors for shopping. We also took a snorkel trip to a near by reef which was very worth while. The little things- *Bring a cheap float or raft for the pool and beach, it was worth it. *Bring insulated mugs, the bar will fill it for you. *Bug spray *Plenty of small bills for tipping, although not required it is greatly appreciated by the workers - they work very hard. *Mattress cushions are available if you find you mattress to firm. *During our stay, the monkeys were found most by the pool side trees. *On Wednesdays there is a beach party and beach paella which we highly recommend. *The gym was acceptable and the tennis courts were great. *Court times can booked in the gym, book located at the gym entrance. *Always have your camera ready because you never know what animals you might see. *NO FREE internet Overall, we had a great time and would come back because it is such a great value.", "Date": "July 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cparadise\u201d", "Author": "veronica032", "ReviewID": "UR71937056", "Content": "first time at ibero star quetzal yes it took long to get there but once you are there the whole place is amazing.

The babay monkeys, Iguanas etc.The food was fine there was plenty to choose from. The beds were perfect I don't see why people complain.

At the front desk thank you to patti she was great . Loved the hotel I will be going back in oct with the family can't wait. Went to playa del carmen payed 5 dollars the beach there is beautiful too if you stay at ibero star propertys you can use the ibero star cozumel for the dya until 6:00pm take a ferry from play del carmen 20 dollars per person then a cab to cozumel show your bracelet It was nice i like the quetzal better. You can buy gifts at playa del carmen it's cheaper look for the stores that say market. They sell the silver bracelets for 7 or 10 dollars.

We have 4 boys ranging from 22 to 14. We chose to return to the Quetzal/Tucan to celebrate my parents 50th anniversary with 12 of our extended family members. We had the same opinion last time...that this is a great place for families with teens, younger children and for family reunions and celebrations such as what we had. First of all we always go with the mind-set of...\"let nothing bother you that isn't really important\" that being said...I will say we had a \"5 star\" time in a 4 star resort. This place, both Quetzal and Tucan (same resort) has the most beautiful beach and great jungle as most people have written. We chose this place again because we like the rustic, jungle feel to the resort and the grounds are kept so immaculate. I do not care for a resort that feels open with marble pillars everywhere (that is my own opinion) these resorts have a feel of \"real Mexican tropics\" with the waterfalls , stone and wood plank pathways that wind through the dense (and dark at night) jungle in the center of the resorts. Bring comfortable shoes... paths are somewhat rugged...and the marble floors get slick when wet. We tried to get our rooms together (we had 6 rooms) but they had to put us in several different buildings (at first I tried to make them change the rooms...it worked out fine and we made the best of it. ) I stayed in room 2128 on quetzal side. we had a beautiful \"partial\" view of the ocean and we were close to the pool and beach. We were very happy with our room and it was always cleaned early which was nice. The only problem some may have with this side of building 21 maybe that the music at night from the resort next door was quite loud until almost 11:45pm. This maybe a problem with someone with smaller children. It wasnt a problem for us. My parents had room 1009 (Tucan side) which was very convenient overlooking the beach and pool was very close. They loved their room and loved that they did not have to climb the stairs and yet had a great view of the ocean and the kids playing volleyball. I felt like their room smelled a bit musty but it did not bother them and they were so pleased with it. We felt like the food was good in the buffets and hit or miss in the specialty restaurants. It was not gourmet food but we always found plenty that we could enjoy. (loved the guacamole and the salsa and fresh mangos, papayas) My kids loved all the selection and were very happy. The ocean was amazing...beach beautiful...the sand did not get hot on our feet...we did parasailing (spelling?) at the dive shop which was amazing and well worth the $65 per person. It was an amazing view from so high up (bring your camera up with you if you can) Also my boys rented the jet-skis $65 and they took out a sailboat (no charge...just reserve them early in the day) We spent most of our time on the beach...and the boys loved the beach volleyball. The pool was great in the beginning of the week...by the end of the week it was sooooo hot. It was not refreshing at all and more like a bath. But we had fun in it anyway. We did a couple of great excursions we would highly recommend. first: Selvetica : Corona Rally (zip-line, dune-buggy and zip line into a ceynote) It was a blast!!!! highly recommend it...see it on trip advisor #1Cancun excursions. My 72 and 74 year old parents even did it and had a great time! The staff was very helpful and alot of fun. Also we did \"The Jungle Place\" It is a monkey rescue sanctuary...8 of us went and sat with the spider monkeys who were so sweet and would crawl on us and fall asleep in our arms. Look it up on trip advisor...it is not far but really off the main roads. (we hired a van from Olympus Tours at the resort to take us and bring us back) The Jungle Place is not a touristy excursion...it is a sweet couple who have dedicated their lives to rescue these adorable spider monkeys and have built an \"amazing home\" and sanctuary for these monkeys in the jungle...if you love animals and can appreciate their heart of compassion and dedication to saving the monkeys it is a wonderful experience. Both these excursions we booked online ahead of time. My parents also loved the trip they took to Tulum and said it was their personal favorite thing they did. We also had our group photographed by the photographer in the Quetzal Lobby photo shop...the photos came out wonderful (we planned it ahead before we left that we would wear white and Khaki and take photos by the beach) It cost nothing for the photo shoot and the photos were very reasonable to purchase. We gave him a $20 dollar tip because he did a great job and the photos of our family by the beach at sunset are priceless...So go and reserve a photo session for your family by the beach before you leave. Well worth it!!! Enjoy the memories! We are!!!! We had a great time and we thought this was a great place for our family to vacation.

We required 4 rooms and had emailed the hotel several weeks beforehand to request that we be placed close together at the resort and requested to stay in the 3 buildings in the middle of the hotel. We received an email back saying that it depended on occupancy at the time and that they would try their best to accomodate. Upon arriving at the hotel around 11:30 am, the reception area was full. Also, it was raining very hard due to Tropical Storm Alex. There seemed to be mass chaos as the clerk was trying to give hotel check in information to the full group of people standing there. Needless to say, with that many people talking and several different languages being spoken, our group hung back until all of these people were gone. As our group is checking in, I mentioned that we had requested rooms close by one another. The clerk completely ignored me and began telling us the rooms with some in the front buildings, some in the middle, and some by the pool. The clerk left us standing there to attend to others several times during the check in process and told us \"No, he does not show we requested anything.\" So here we go trying to get rooms close by another. After about 30-45 minutes, we finally were given 2 rooms in Bldg 23 and 2 rooms in Bldg 25, but could not check in until around 2:30. We were told the main lunch buffet was not open yet, but the steak house buffet (by the pool) was open now if we were hungry. The clerk did not mention that we would get completely soaked going to this buffet. No one mentioned in any of the reviews that the hotel is completely open air. You cannot go anywhere in the hotel without having to walk outside at some point. We go to the steak house buffet, running in the rain, and are completely soaked when we get there since it is the restaurant farthest from the lobby. Aftter eating and then walking in the rain back to the lobby to check on our rooms, we sat in the lobby for close to 2 hours waiting. When we finally did receive our room, one of the couples that had requested a king bed, received a room with 2 doubles. After calling to the lobby, they were told they could change them the next day. After much confusion and having to get a manager and Lomas Travel involved Tuesday afternoon, they were finally moved on Wednesday! Overall, the hotel is beautiful. Very nice grounds, beautiful beach, huge pool. The pool chairs are all reserved by 9:00 am unless you go down early like everyone else and put your towels on a chair to reserve them. If not, you will not be able to find a chair until the end of the day. There are rules that you cannot reserve chairs, but apparently management does not enforce. The rooms are average and a good size, but not anything extravagant. The bathrooms are very hot and you will need to bring your own hair dryer if it takes you over 5 minutes to dry your hair. Walking through the buildings is very dangerous when it is raining. The tile is very slippery and we had to walk holding the walls to ensure that we did not slip and fall. Walking through the trails with the animals roaming freely is amazing the first day or two, after that, you wish that the peacocks were not there. They have a very high pitch squeal that could be described as a woman screaming. They begin this noise around 5:00 am and if you plan on sleeping in, the peacocks have other plans for you. The buffets are good, with the breakfast buffet being best. Staying there 8 days, we never got tired of the food and they have such a large selection that you never have to eat the same things twice. The beach grill was good also-hamburgers, hot dogs, nachos. The steak fries were the best! The beds are very hard and I had to call the reception area 3 times and go to the lobby twice to get the egg crate foam added. It made the bed a little more bearable but I still felt like I needed a massage every morning after getting up. I had problems with my room key card and had to go to the lobby 5 times in 3 days. This is very irritating when you see how big the resort is and having to walk up front every time to get it reprogrammed. The last time I made the guy give me a whole new card and it worked fine after that. On the last day, we waited over an hour for the bellboy to come get the luggage. The guys ended up dragging our bags to the lobby themselves after giving up on the bellboys. The restaurant reservations are not very accomodating. The area to sign up for these is only open certain hours of the day. We had 3 reservations available that we signed up for the 2nd day we arrived. We could only get 9:00 on Tuesday for the Japanese restaurant, 9:00 on Wednesday for the Steak House restaurant, and 7:00 on Friday for the Tropical restaurant. We felt as if we had to make our plans for the day based around their schedule. The Japanese was good, the steak house service was horrible (no salad at all when we went to the buffet and had to ask for it to be restocked and the waiter never refilled our glasses), and the tropical was wonderful. I highly recommend the steak with mango chutney sauce. Dilber and Sergio w/Lomas Travel was wonderful in planning our excursions. We booked trips to Xcaret, Xplor, and to go fishing in Maroma. Xcaret and Xplor are well worth the $99/person. It is alot of walking at both but we had a great time. The guys on our trip went fishing and had a great time. The restaurant at the marina cooked their catch for lunch for them to enjoy. We would have preferred bringing the fish back to the hotel for dinner, but the hotel refused. We stayed at the Gran Porto Real in September 2009 and they gladly cooked the fish for us at their Mexican restaurant . We went to 5th Avenue 3 nights while we were there and had a great time. Good places to shop, eat, and drink. I highly recommend La Capricho on 2nd story at intersection of 5th and Calle Corazon. Macario is a great cook and cooks your meal at your table! Second time that we ate there and better than the first. And the Haagen Daz was visited on more than one occasion also. Overall, this hotel would have been a great place to stay if the lobby services were overhauled. The reception never had enough people on staff and you could never talk to the same person twice. You always had to call or stop by the lobby more than once to get anything you needed. The hotel is not very accomodating once you get there. It seems as if you always have to be on their schedule instead of enjoying a spontaneous relaxing vacation. I think this would be a great place to stay if the management was changed out and they made efforts to be more accomodating to their guests. I personally will never stay at this hotel again.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Overland Park, Kansas", "Title": "\u201cWatch out for the food\"\u201d", "Author": "Mary38969", "ReviewID": "UR70563278", "Content": "We researched this hotel for a few months before going.

This is our 6th trip to Playa and we still love it as much as the first time we went, if not even more. We have stayed in all-inclusive hotels in Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, as well as traveled to Hawaii, Antigua, Belize, Malaysia, and Indonesia with our kids. We love to travel, especially internationally, providing our kids with experiences rather than just stuff. We usually chose a 3.5 star, saving money and traveling more often. If you are looking for a perspective of \"luxury travel,\" sorry that is not us. Enjoy the journey, even the delays at the airport. The only way to avoid the headaches of travel is to stay home and who wants to do that? Oh yeah, don't drop the kids off with the grandparents, take them with you. The beach work done in February has all the resorts up and down the main hotel zone in good shape and wider than we have ever seen it since the damaging hurricane of 2005. That being said, the sand is not as soft and the water not as clear, I guess due to the work, but still absolutely beautiful. Expect some coral in the water, but it makes for great shell hunting. The resort is a little larger than we normally prefer (when you combine the Iberostar Tucan side). There are separate lobbies, but the pool, beach, entertainment, and most restaurants are shared by both sides really creating one resort. Although larger, it is a very well laid out resort. There is a large pool with multiple depths and plenty of room. The adults only pool is tucked away for those who would rather look at the bottom of the bottle rather than the incredible surroundings. There is a kids pool and playground for the really young and another activities pool for water polo, basketball, etc. In other words, a place for everyone. The jungle like setting is nice, but if you have elderly people going with you the walkways are cemented rocks and slanted, creating a little bit of an uneven surface. For most, not a big deal at all and somewhat authentic with the wildlife. The biggest complaint I have seen in reviews is with regards to the food. We had no complaints about the food at all. If you take the price of the trip, back out the airfare and room, the price paid for unlimited food (including some of the freshest fruit and vegetables around), not having to buy it, cook it, and clean it up, we feel it is a great value. Not just a great value, but really good for a 3.5-4 star, which is what you are paying for. The rooms are adequate size, clean, and well air conditioned. For some down time, the channels include a variety of Spanish and English stations. The beds are \"firm.\" We learned a little trick a couple of years ago. A full-sized foam mattress topper costs around $10 and two fit into a full sized suitcase. As long as the extra luggage doesn't cost more, this is money well spent for a good night's rest and can be reused on future trips. If you don't want to do that, Wal-Mart in Playa probably carries a similar product (but who wants to go to WM while on vacation?). This room was the least \"musty smelling\" of any resort in this area that we have been to, although the \"must smell\" means \"we are at the beach\" which is a great thing (so we actually like it). Another travel tip is to use the \"space bags\" that don't require a vacuum. Excellent for travel, going and dirty close on the way back that never seem to pack as easily as they did when the trip began. The people of the resort. First the staff. Excellent customer service in the Riviera Maya has always been standard at every resort we have stayed. What a great culture. People who work extremely hard, appreciate the beauty of their land, and luckily for us enjoy sharing it. The other travelers were made up of a diverse group. We always enjoy being surrounded by others from around the world. Canadian, British, French, Dutch, US, Mexican, Spanish, and many others vacationing together is a great perk, especially during the World Cup. To my fellow Americans, please leave the \"bubba keggs\" at home. They are not improving our international image any. Lastly, would we return to the Quetzal? Absolutely, but we are still a little partial towards the Riu Playacar and Yucatan. Just a personal preference. The Quetzal and the Riu's consistently rank very well on Tripadvisor so you can't go wrong with either. On another note it seems that reviews are becoming less frequent on Tripadvisor. Please give a review after your trip. Obviously if you are reading this, it helps you decide.

The sand has coral in it and does not get hot! Pretty amazing if you ask me. The water also was the most gorgeous shade of blue you could imagine- like it shouldn't even be found in nature. Simply stunning and calm waves so if you float for a awhile you'll notice you barely even move. Though we always found a palapa to sit under, didn't seem like enough umbrellas were available and it was always a competition to get a seat with some shade at the beach. Always plenty of space at the pools, but it was way too hot to sit there with no breeze and the pool water was like bath water. This resort is in a jungle- yes with howling monkeys who sound like screaming babies and peacocks who sound like really loud cats in heat. Every morning at 5am both of these otherwise fascinating animals start yelling their heads off. However perfect the rest of this resort is, this is reason enough that I would not go back. Sad to say, we were anxious to get back home for a full night's sleep. Food: the specialty restaurants were all very delicious and exceeded my expectations. One of my friends traveling with us was vegetarian and although none of the specialty restaurants have a single vegetarian entree listed on them, each was able to accommodate. The buffets served the same exact food every day we were there (8 days) which was pretty boring and the food was definitely not as good. Keep in mind that during your stay you can only eat at the specialty restaurants 3x. Oh, and by the way, not a single one of the places to eat is air conditioned. It was June when we went and already very hot which we expected, but it would be nice to eat in an air conditioned restaurant for dinner. Unfortunately on our trip, my boyfriend lost his wallet. We were told to talk to Guest Services (this is the concierge basically: lost & found, where to make dinner reservations, order extras, spa appts, etc.) but they are closed from 12-4 everyday which is especially nuts since the towel guy wasn't even able to leave his towel hut from 8am-7pm everyday. Seems like something at important as Guest Services should be open for the majority of the day. No one at the desk seemed to really want to do anything about it until the 3rd day, day before we left. I don't blame them for him losing his wallet, just doesn't make sense why a resort was filed 3 days later and not when it happened or why they weren't able to call and talk to staff at different locations about it- we tried but had problems with the language. The night entertainment pleasantly surprised us. I have been to all-inclusives before with really cheesy shows. Iberostar Star Friends really do a good job though!

Just a married couple in our late 40's (ok I'm a bit older) who are spending our kids money. From 6/16 - 6/20 we stayed in the Quetzal side of the hotel. From check in to check out one of the finest experiences my wife and I have ever had in Mexico. Room: Nothing special, but with that, it was comfortable, roomy, and well air conditioned. in room safe, no extra charge. Mini fridge, stocked with water, sodas, and a few beers. We spent enough time in the room to sleep, shower and cool off. We were in 2230, second floor facing jungle. That is the best way to go at this resort. Plenty of activity in the trees around your room with the monkeys howling at each other. Restaurants: What we discovered, very quickly , is that they are hot, no air conditioning in the buffets, but seem to be in the two inside specialty restaurants. With that, we started to eat later 8 - 830 or so. By that time it was fine. Buffets had more options than I could ever sample, and I like my food. It was well prepared, clean and plenty of it. And very diverse. We only ate ate two speciality restaurants. the steak house and the Caribbean. Both were excellent. For breakfast the buffets offered everything you would expect, and omlettes prepared fresh. Lunch at the buffetts were excellent as well with choices that you would not expect. So as the breakfast buffets wind down the lunch buffets start up. and at the same time the outside grill begins and it stays open until dinner around the resort starts. Plenty of food and well prepared. Now if you;re looking for chicken fingers, chicken nuggets and chicken wings like at Hooters, forget it. You are in MEXICO, it is food cooked by mexicans, in mexico to cater to as many cultures as possible. We heard whines from kids, prepare them for something different. The pools: I could write for hours on this. Main pool, very clean, and spacious. No swim up bar here, which is a plus in my opinion and i will elaborate on that in a bit. Adult pool had swim up bar and was just big enough to make it a great place to meet people and cool off a bit. There was also a kids only pool that was used quite a bit as well. The main pool had two different sides to it, one where the water gradually deepened and the other where it was 4' to 5' immediately. This allowed for the groups without children to be on one side and the families with mid age kids on the other. The pool area was always maintained and no trash/glasses were ever out longer than a few minutes. Chair could be hard to find if you got down there after 8 but other wise we never had a problem finding a place to sit The Beach; Without a doubt the best in mexico. Plenty of chairs, palapas and best of all, for us, beach umbrellas. The umbrellas allowed us to get right up on the waters edge and position the umbrella to keep us out of the nuclear mid day sun when needed. Cleanest beach, patrolled with security, and.....best of all.....waitresses. Which when tipped. seem to come back to fill your glasses quite often. Once again I could not say enough about the beach and pool area. Bars. One in main lobby one in the center of resort (which had the top shelf stuff) one inbetween the pool and beach one in the adult pool, And also in each restaurant. BRING A \"BUBBA KEG\". best 4.00 we ever spent. staff will fill them up and are happy to do it. Staff: Always was smilling, saying hello, and asking if they could do something for you. I was really surprised at the level of service here. Maid service, room service, wait staff, bell boys, All were very happy to be there and to help, and here is why I think that is: No screaming teenagers learing how to drink at this resort. Unlike cancun and other resort areas that have many locations to drink at and seem to encourage that atmosphere, the other guests at this resort ranged from young familes with small children, families with teenagers, (very well manered). small groups of college age kids. Couples just wanting to be by themselves, seniors that wanted to be like the college kids. In all I was about as impressed with the diversity of the guests and their friendliness as I was the staff at their hospitality. People would smile and say hello as you walked by and it made for a very relaxing and enjoyable week. Met a great couple from Holland and really enjoyed learning about them and their culture. The resort: A you read through the rest of the reviews you can believe it all about the tropical setting, animals, and general feel of the resort. it is mostly covered by trees and vegitation. which, in our opinion, gave this resort everything. Finally; My wife and I have been to 10 resorts abroad and this is without a doubt the best experience we have had. I have only taken the time to write two reviews, this and one other that was the worse experience we ever had. This resort caters to families, couples and wedding parties. You will not be happy if you arrive looking for the binge week in mexico. By the way, Playa Del Carmen is very different from the Cancun experience, They do have a few of the popluar night clubs, but the downtown area is very \"Artsy\" as my wife describes it which gives way to the many outside cafes and restaurants. Hope your experience will be as great as ours.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Grange Texas", "Title": "\u201cWe spent June 13th to June 17th 2010 at Iberostar Quetzal, Playa Del Carmen.\u201d", "Author": "somethinggr8", "ReviewID": "UR67991075", "Content": "We spent June 13th to June 17th 2010 at Iberostar Quetzal, Playa Del Carmen. We are still crying because we were not ready to come home. My husband & I are in our late 40s and went without our kids and our travel mates are in their 50s. We arrived in Cancun at 9:00 am Lomas travel scooped us up and put us on a van with a few other travelers. We did have to wait for a prolonged period for some travelers that did not get with the program they were playing around in the airport instead of coming to the desk to meet Lomas. Fate or Karma quickly paid them back for making us wait by having her luggage slowly unzip the girls thong panties & neon green bra fell out on the sidewalk she had to walk behind the porter and pick up her underwear before getting on the bus\u2026 Her companion yelled to all of us \u201cwe were the biggest bunch of unhappy people he had ever seen on vacation\u201d\u2026 enough about that !! The Lomas guy (I do not remember his name) was a very comical & entertaining tour guide on the way to the resort. We arrived at the Iberostar around 11:30 am. We travel with another couple their room 2745 was ready our room 2746 was, not someone was still in it. We had our luggage taken to 2745 and went to the pool & to check things out. We passed Peacocks, Parrots, Koi fish, Swans, Flamingos, Turtles, & waterfalls from lobby to pool. Beautiful!!.. One of the reasons we picked this resort was for the animals, jungle like landscape it advertised. It did not disappoint us. Our room was not ready to after 3:00 pm. Our Room 2746 is on the third floor of building 27. Our balcony overlooked the jungle area with the monkeys & flamingoes.. The peacocks go everywhere they would \u201cvisit\u201d our balcony in the morning & evenings. Room: Our room 2746 was a little bigger than our travel mates 2745. We had 2 couch / daybeds in our room their room had one. (I have posted pictures of our room) Their room did have an extra enclosed storage area. These couch/daybeds are big enough for a child or preteen to sleep on so room 2746 has 2 of them if you need the extra sleeping room. Yes the beds are hard but we all slept well every night. Both of our rooms had a clothes drying holder on each balcony. The bathrooms were the same; with walk in showers a large counter top for bathroom items. We do always bring a clear shoe organizer for the back of the bathroom door, we probably could have done without it. The bathroom counter had enough room for everything\u2026 But it is more organized using the shoe holder. On the first morning I saw 3 monkeys in the trees outside our balcony one was a baby that would fit in the palm of your hand. CUTE !!! Pool: The pool is big and there are many pools. (pictures of the main pool is also posted). The gift shop in the lobby does sell float for $ 12.00 USD. You can bring one cheaper from home if purchased ffrom Wal-Mart or Target. The dive shop will blow them up for $1.00. We planned to leave ours for others to use after us but ended up needing them to separate wet from dry clothes in the luggage. There are a lot of regular lounge chairs & a few cabanas maybe 5 or 6 around the big pool. You have to get out early to get one; they are first come first served. The cabanas go quick & people keep them all day. I went out at 6:30am one morning to walk the beach & all the cabanas already had someone reserving them. Someone did steal one of our towels while we were in the pool. There is a $9.00 USD plus tax charge for missing beach towels. Entertainment: In the time we were there we did not go to any of the shows. I heard mixed reviews on them and honestly we did so many things during the day we were ready to go to bed early every night.. I wish now we would have tried at least one of them out. Food: The food was for the most part good. We are not picky & found something every night that each of us liked. The buffet by the lobby was the best buffet. We ate by the pool for lunch every day. The ice cream is rich and sweet and served by the beach bar. I had some almost every day it was YUMMY !!! At every restaurant the wait staff was very good. Those people are hard workers. They were always eager to attend to your every wish. Some other travelers were rude & bossy but they were always eager to make your visit with them pleasant. Excursion: We did go on a SCUBA/Snorkeling dive with Dressel Divers. We all did the free educational dive in the swimming pool. The 2 men latched on to SCUBA the 2 women were more comfortable with staying with snorkeling. We took a trip to the Cozumel Iberostar. The Dressel divers took us to the barrier reefs for 2 dives. Very beautiful, lots of fish, we all had a great time. Drinks: We all like Dos Equis beer so we were glad it was on tap. The fridge in the room just barely kept anything cooler than room temperature. The drinks were a little bland. The juices used in the drinks seemed watered down and of course the ice cubes melt quickly. The bartenders were always cheerful and hard-working and a pleasure to visit with. We did discover some drinks called \u201delectric\u201d lemonade, blue, or strawberry. They had some taste and I liked them\u2026 The welcome drink is non-alcoholic but you can request one with alcohol and they were also very good. Be prepared to sweat A LOT\u2026 We took showers in the morning, at lunch, to get ready for dinner, after eating dinner. I would do it again.. Over all this is the first all-inclusive resort we would come back to and look forward to it. I plan to call our travel agent on Monday to ask her to start shopping for pricing for next year for this resort or one rated better. We plan to take the whole family or at least invite them on a trip back next year.", "Date": "June 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cWonderful place if you know what to do\u201d", "Author": "skiracerchick113", "ReviewID": "UR67843845", "Content": "I am writing from the perspective of 18 year old female. Overall the Iberostar Quetzal is a great place to relax, and enjoy the Mexican culture. I went with my parents, my 20 year old brother, and my 18 year old friend. Now I will get into some specifics. Beach: Since your coming to the resort for the beach the beach is great! The beach is made of white sand that is soft, yet hot during the day. There are some sharp rocks on the beach from people digging up the sand that you need to be careful of, and a few hard pebbles when you enter the water, but other than that its nice on your feet. There are workers who will come pick up your finished drinks and even bring you drinks to the beach. There are covered \"tiki\" like huts where you can sit in the shade, but you have to get up relatively early about 7:30-8:00 to get a seat under these huts. Ocean: Ocean was spectacular!!! The water is turquoise and you can always see the bottom and what is around you. When we were there the waves were very strong, but you could still go out farther where you would be in calm waters. One day there was no waves and it was really nice. Pool: There is one large pool that is used and the water in the pool is almost like a hot tub. I did not like this pool because it was so hot. It can be nice if you like hot pools because it is relatively deep. There is an adults only pool with a swim up bar where you can sit on bar stools or in small cornered areas. This area never got to rowdy, but the water was colder. There is also a kids pool, and a game pool. Food: The food is pretty good for all inclusive. Of course you can get tired of the selection, but I enjoyed some items that I liked and kept eating them. I recommend the rice and pico de gallo because it is very fresh. The large buffet's breakfast is larger and better than the snack place, but is only open til 10am which we often missed. The snack place breakfast is still perfectly fine and you can have specialty omelets made for you. There is also coffee and cappuccinos available. I only ate lunch at the snack bar and it is similar to dinner at the buffet. The chips and guacamole is great! Also they have a soft serve ice cream machine and a ice cream stand. THe ice cream stand is much better and I recommend the coconut ice cream. The dinner at the buffet has a large selection where you can try new things. You get a few coupons for specialty restaurants and we went to the Japanese and Steak. The Japanese is really fun because the cook the food right in front of you. If it's your birthday tell them because they prepare a small show, and will make you a tequila drink and shove it down your throat ;) The steak house was good, but make sure you meat is fully cooked. A plus to the buffet is that it is open until 4 am so after the discos you can refuel! There is also free room service until 11pm at night which is great, the tacos are wonderful, but don't bother ordering the deserts they are only about an inch wide and look like they were pre packaged. Bars: I will start with the lobby bar. The lobby bar is a nice place to hangout and get a drink before or after the evening show. You can get top-shelf drinks here unlike the other bars. It can get hot because there are only overheard fans, but it is a calming place that doesn't get to crowed, but attracts enough. There is a bar at the Theater where you can get drinks, and it usually doesn't get too busy because people are too lazy to get up. Although wait-staff will bring you drinks from the bar to your seat, but it takes a while. The bar at the snack shop is good also because many don't think to go in there, but you have to ask for top-shelf if you want it. The main bar at the beach gets crowded and you have to wait in line. Sometimes they don't want to make specialty shots for you, but usually they will make you whatever you want. Also at the bars they have cocktail menus in case you get stuck and want ideas, also if you ask the bartenders they will make you great drinks. I recommend the Margaritas on the rocks or frozen, Long Island Iced Teas, Crazy Frog shot, Kamikaza Shot, Blue Lagoon Shot, and the Tequila Boom Boom Shot. Disco: The disco at the hotel is La Mascara. It opens at 10:30 pm, and by all means do not go at 10:30pm. We made this mistake the first night for my birthday and we were the first people in there, certainly we didn't care after we had a few drinks, but it does feel empty. The disco never really got crowded, the maximum people that were in there was about 40 which doesn't seem like much because only a few people will dance. I lose my camera in the disco and it was never found, so keep a close watch on your belongings! The disco is a nice place to go and pre-game before you go to Playa Del Carmen. Playa Del Carmen for Disco: I would strongly recommend going to Playa Del Carmen if you would like some quality night time fun. We only went there for one night and it was our last night on a Monday and it was still relatively busy. There are many little bars where you can sometimes get free drinks or free covers. I would recommend going to Coco Bongo because it is the biggest club in Playa. They have shows about every 30 minutes where we saw Lady Marmalade and a Acrobat type of thing. You can dance on the bars, and there is stadium standing, but you need to be careful. We got in for free, but typically you have to pay $50. If you walk around and bargain you can usually get free passes to clubs, especially if you are with girls. Playa Del Carmen during the day: You can walk to Playa from the hotel in about 45 minutes. It is nice because you pass a couple of other resorts as well as some houses. Playa can be very hot during the day when you are walking around shopping because there is no breeze. It's fun to walk around and look at the shops, but everyone will yell at you to look at their stuff and unless you really are going to buy something just keep walking. You can haggle and lower the prices usually starting at $30 and getting it to about $10-$15. There are popular restaurants like Carlos n Charlies or Senor Frogs, but also smaller places where you can get beers and chips for cheap. Cozumel: One day we took the fairy to Cozumel. It takes about 30-40 minutes and costs about $24 round trip. The fairy is fun, and I didn't even get sea sick. Cozumel is similar to Playa with the shops, and it also can be hot. We went snorkeling in a small boat to 3 reefs for $20 a person, the original price was $40. Make sure you are familiar with the fairy times because we arrived at 12 and couldn't leave til 5pm. Water Activities at Iberostar: For many days we couldn't participate in any water activities such as sailing, kayaking, or jet skiing because it was too windy. One day we got to go sailing on our own and that was wonderful! We had a Hobie Cat and we went far out and went swimming, even though you arnt' supposed to jump off. We had this boat for an hour and I recommend sailing if you know how. They can also teach you to sail for $40. The do snorkeling trips, but we never did it they are $40 a person. Star Friends: At the resort they have Star Friends which are the employes who run the shows, games, and interact with you. They are very nice and funny. They will drag you all the way across the beach to get you playing games, which is fun, but sometimes a nuisance. At night they perform great shows! Night time Shows: Every night the Star Friends perform shows such as Las Vegas, Magic Show, Movie Night, and Folk. These shows are usually pretty good, but don't start until 9:30 or 10pm. Before the shows they will have games on stage such as beer chugging contests, or musical chairs that are fun to watch. I think I pretty much covered everything!

My husband, kids ages 20 and 16. The beach was excellent! The waves were big and rough the first couple of days due to an unusual weather pattern, but kids loved it! We could always find chairs but if you want a hut you need to go down before 8:00am and claim the one your want! The food was good. I am a vegetarian and could always find something to eat. The one thing we found lacking was the desserts. They were just not that good with the exception of the ice cream at the buffet. YUM! We really liked the Japanese restaurant and the steakhouse was okay (not much different than buffet). Husband said they need swamp coolers in lobby to keep the air circulated. Don't plan on arriving early and expect your room to be ready. Check in is at 3:00pm and they seem to stick to that time. We stayed in building 22, top floor opposite jungle side and really liked it. Not as loud as jungle side if you like to sleep in. The peacocks are really loud in the mornings. We were really close to beach and pools which was really handy if you forget something. One warning if you get top floor...no elevator! We spent the majority of our day either on the beach or in the pool. The main pool was really hot so we spent most of our time at the beach. The bar pool is much cooler. The ocean water was perfect temp. We had fun at the evening shows. They were all good with the exception of Las Vegas night we didn't much care for that one.

The hotel is very nice-beautiful grounds, very clean, nice common areas. I especially liked that when we sat on our balcony, the only thing we could see was greenery-no views of other rooms. We also had a nesting pea hen and her babies in the planter box on our balcony. My only complaint (ironically) was the LOUD bird noise at 6:00 am every morning. Other than that, the hotel was pretty quiet. We did hear the music from the nightly shows, but it shut down early enough that it did not disturb us. We spent most of our time on the beautiful, and very clean, beach. We never had any trouble finding lounge chairs. My husband used the catamaran one day and had to wait two days to be able to book it-if you know your schedule well enough in advance, book that early. We also did an excursion (booked at the palapa by the beach) to a snorkeling lagoon and to Dos Ojos cenote. Highly recommend that-the cenote was incredible. Three of us used wet suits, one did not and he was fine. We also took the bus to Tulum one day. Much cheaper than a taxi or an excursion, but you are at the \"mercy\" of the bus' erratic time schedule. We hired a guide at Tulum but you do not need one. We also did not understand ahead of time that there are stairs at the ruins that lead to the beach-it was terribly hot and a swim would've been great. Took a taxi ($5 US) into Playa one night for dinner. Fun and interesting town, but aggressive sales people. One openly offered to sell us drugs. We ate breakfast and lunch at the main buffet each day and found the breakfast better than the lunch. Lunch was okay, nothing spectacular (except for the mango ice cream) but certainly not bad. We ate dinner at the buffet some nights; other nights we tried the Japanese, the Mexican and the Caribbean specialty restaurants. Again, if you know your schedule in advance book those as soon as you check in-they do fill up. We found the dinner to be good to very good. Our family does not vacation for the food, however. We are not picky eaters, but do appreciate a good meal. The service in all restaurants was excellent and all were spotless. We usually spent an hour or so in the bar each evening. Here is one area that was not great-the drinks were not very good. Ice chunks in the frozen drinks and very little alcohol. We never went to an evening show, nor did we spend time by the pools-that beach was just too appealing. If you are looking for a relaxing, beach-oriented resort, this is the place.

Prior to booking I read over 100 reviews on this website about the hotel. So we arrived with minimal expectations. Please read the other reviews. I will provide my comments that are in addition or contradiction to what I read. I\u2019ll give you the Good, Bad, and some Tips. Prior to arrival I emailed the hotel and requested a room in building 23, on the third floor. I did this based on other reviews complaining about their building location and the looong walk to the beach. The hotel gave me EXACTLY what I asked for!! Unless you have an oceanfront suite, the other closest buildings are 22, 23, 24, 25. TIP #1. Any building above #25 is closer to the lobby, and large eating buffet. Yes, I did get noise from the nightly shows at the adjacent hotel, but it usually ended by 11pm. Email ahead of time and request building #22, 23, 24. We also requested a foam cover for the mattress. Yes, the beds are on concrete slats like platform beds so the mattress hard. Housekeeping brought the foam (egg carton) to our room within minutes. TIP #2. Request the foam cover when you check-in if you need a little extra cushion on your mattress. We also made our restaurant reservations for the Mexican restaurant when we checked-in. The restaurant reservation desk is right across from the reception desk so it was easy to do . We ate at the Mexican restaurant for all our reservations. We figured, \u201cits Mexico, this has to be the best restaurant on the resort\u201d. TIP #3. Make your restaurant reservation early to ensure you get the restaurant and time you want. TIP #4. The liquor is very cheap. The mojitos are the best thing there. If you like beer, you\u2019ll love it here. However, if you tip the servers and beach attendants they will give you a better brand of liquor and make sure your cup is always full. We brought $2 insulated cups from home and they gladly filled our 32oz cups with mojitos and daiquiris without request. They came over and asked us every 30 minutes if we needed more drinks. AWESOME staff!! TIP #5. Bring lots of $1 bills with you. In our $6 we used about $30 of single bills. Use them to tip the beach servers, housekeeping, restaurant staff. A couple dollars g along way here with the staff! The GOOD: Great staff! Everyone was polite, helpful, always said \u201cHola\u201d in passing. They are some very hard workers! The rooms were clean. VERY clean. I never saw a bug, hair, or a pieces of trash in my room. The food is just okay. However, we did not get sick! We found a couple dishes we liked and stayed with those for every meal. Primarily the chicken (baked, grilled, fried) . The beach Paella and Sangria is WONDERFUL!! But they only do it one or two days a week. This is a great location in Playacar. We felt very safe and loved to walk to the neighborhood Starbucks! The BAD: There is NO Air Conditioning in the hotel except in your room. That includes the lobby, the public restrooms, the buffets. They say the hotel major restaurants are air conditioned, but they are NOT. I was in there sweating like was outside. The wall unit air conditioner doesn\u2019t work wel. The pool water is hot! You just can\u2019t cool off at this place. The pool water was as warm as the hot tub water. It was all like bathwater. The ocean is the only cool water. People reserves beach and pool seats early in the morning. Despite what the hotel says, they do it anyway. The \u201cjungle friends\u201d (animals) are very loud and noisy. The peacocks start about 4am and you will hear them all day. The monkeys sounds like lions and scared us the first night. They are very loud and the noise echoes. Poor resort layout. The entertainment pavilion is in the middle of the resort. At night if you want to see a show, you must go there. And there is NO breeze in the middle of the resort. The entertainment should be on the beach (like the other hotels). The major buffets that you need to eat in are located in the middle of the resort. They should be on the beach where the breeze is. You will sweat the entire time you are eating breakfast, lunch and dinner. Remember\u2026 no air conditioning. Don\u2019t shop at the resort shop. You cant return anything. We bought swim trunks, tried them on in the public restroom. They were too small. Took them right back and they said No Returns. But didn\u2019t tell us that when we bought them. The adult swim-up bar (located away from the maiin pool) was like a fraternity club full of older men reliving their college or biker days. It was loud and wild there. We used the Fitness Center almost everyday. It is small and crowded. It has all the necessary equiptment. But...the equiptment is very old, rusted from the humidity and never cleaned. There isnt cleaning materials to clean your equiptment when finished... and they dont wipe it down either. We got a really good deal on a package so I wont complain about the overall trip. I doubt we will return to this resort, and only recommend it to certain friends that are looking for a deal.

Stayed May 28th thru June 4th. I will give you the honest pros and cons. A true five star is Broadmoor or a Ritz Carlton. Pros - great location, very close to town and activities. Staff is great, very helpful and go out of their way to help even with babies. Rooms are clean but not what I would say fancy. Pool is great, but no swim up bar (you have to get out of pool and walk up to beach bar to get a drink). Shows are fun and the kids like them. Very clean property. Lots of activities to keep whole family busy. Food was good and plentiful. Japanese was fun and mexican good. Great beach. Ice cream all the time. Older kids, we took a 9 year old can do what ever they want and make friends and run around without being watched. Plenty of polapas and chairs available. Cons - No swim up bar in main pool. Adult pool was gross and cloudy everyday. Baby pool water was hot, did not see any babies in that pool. Drinks are terrible, cheap liquor, only Dos Equis beer (which got old in about a day, went to town and bought Bud Light). Due to the volume of people that is probably why the drinks are so inconsistant and cheaper liquor is used. Some people stay up very late (3 or 4 in the morning) talking outside your room in the hall ways, when families are trying to sleep. This is not a party resort but some people are rude. It is true that you better get up early to reserve a good spot by the pool, but if you have kids you probably are up. To sum it up if you are looking for a fun family resort (which we were) then this is a great place. Great service from employees. Close to town. Close to airport. Not for quiet time or couples. Bad drinks. No pool bar. Very busy. I would recommend this resort to others, not a 5 star 3 1/2 at best. We like Iberostar properties and will visit them again (Playa Paraiso is much nicer and bigger, but costs more). You can't beat the cost it is very resonable for what you get. What makes this resort great is the staff. We had a great time but will not book this resort again.

You CANNOT be dissapointed with this hotel its impossible...and I'm very confused by the review that said the food and drink is just ok and that not much choice unless you like beer - did they have the wrong hotel???!!!!! There was SUCH a selection I couldn't believe it. Drinks galore, ANYTHING you want. Buffet was great, so some of the dishes are the same some days but there is so much of it there, I think you are completely spoilt for choice! The staff can't do enough for you, the rooms are very nice, beds are hard yes but, I've never slept so well! We were in block 25-pretty perfect with location between the reception and the beach. The peacocks MIGHT wake you up, if you are a light sleeper you might want to take ear plugs. The gardens are lovely, lots of peacocks and some other small animals I'm not sure of their name and, while not an abundance of monkeys they could be seen. I think its perfect location - 5 mins from Playa del Carmen by taxi which is definately worth a visit. Its lovely. You can also walk from the hotel to the Plaza down the road for bits and pieces and a few stalls. Worth tryig the A La Cartes at the hotel-Italian, Mexican and Steakhouse were gorgeous. Pool is massive, then its right on the beach. I really don't think you could ask for anymore. Entertainment is worth a watch-some nights better than others. I'm sure there is stuff I've forgotten to say but overall, we LOVED this place and we loved our holiday.

Overall, this hotel did not disappoint and we would stay again, and again... at least until my son is grown. Check-in: We arrived around 8:00PM after traveling all day and were greeted by a very nervous clerk who invited us to transfer to another IB property as an \"upgrade\". When we confirmed that we were not being bumped, we told him we wanted to stay and he tried to convince us to go to the other hotel for a few more minutes before giving up and giving us keys to our room. I'm not sure what that was about but I heard from another guest that they'd oversold for the next night and were looking for volunteers to change hotels. Other than that, everything was fine and the welcome drink was a nice touch. The Room: We stayed in room 2251: third floor overlooking the \"jungle\" and not far from the beach. We had asked to be placed in building 21 but 22 was pretty close. The rooms were fine - nothing fancy - but perfect for a beach vacation in which you don't really plan to spend much time in the room. The beds are on cement slabs but were perfectly comfortable. We like firm beds and these were perfect for us; we did not ask for a mattress pad. The bathroom has nice tiles and the shower stall was large. Again, nothing fancy, but just fine. We liked that they left a very large bottle of water (3 liters, I think) which we used for brushing teeth, etc. They also left two small bottles of water which we kept refilling so we could take with us to the beach. We never tried the TV and the fridge was a little on the warm side, by US standards, but worked just fine. The room was clean enough. There were no bugs whatsoever except for a few random fast-moving ants in the bathroom... I found some greasy something or another and some hair on the phone so I cleaned myself (mainly b/c my son likes to play with hotel phones). We only got housekeeping twice and they did a great job. When we didn't want housekeeping, the maid would offer us water anyway. The Food: I found the food at the buffets to be perfectly suitable and much better than I expected. There was a very large variety at the main buffet and we liked trying different things. We ate most of our meals at the beach palapa on the Tucan side as it was on the beach (where we spent most of our time) and got a nice breeze. Although the selection there is not a good as a the main buffet, we enjoyed it and there was nothing to complain about. Now, if any of these restaurants were stand alone restaurants in San Francisco, I would not recommend them on their food. But I would on atmosphere. Where else can you eat near the beach in your beachwear and watch people from all over the world interact? Sure the food is not the best, but as I said, much better than I expected in an AI. I would not recommend the specialty restaurants, however. The Mexican and Japanese were mediocre... especially when you compare them to the quality of the buffets. The tropical was decent but not worth the hassle of getting dressed and sticking to a schedule when on a beach vacation. Next time, we're only eating at the buffets. Oh, and the paella on the beach is pretty awesome. The restaurant service was, for the most part, great. Yes, we do tip and we like to make small talk with our wait staff but I'm not sure the good service was just due to that (with a few exceptions). I cannot recommend tipping enough. These people are sweating in their uniforms and work really hard for the tourists. The Bars: The bartenders were super nice and the alcohol was fine. We pretty much drank beer, caipirinhas, and mojitos and were pleased with the flavor. No complaints here... of course this is not an exclusive lounge. If you want fine wine, you should stay elsewhere. This is not that type of hotel. Service Overall: As I stated earlier, the service was great. No complaints. The staff seemed to be trained to say yes no-matter-what. The main buffet did not keep its posted hours and that annoyed me on three occasions. I'm not sure why they couldn't just put a sticky note saying that the restaurant would open two hours later than advertised or close one hour early, but oh well. The Beach: We had some red flag waves and high winds. The lifeguards were iffy so I wouldn't count on them. We thought the palapas were too far from the actual water so we got an umbrella from the towel hut and kept it all week. We could move loungers to the shore and plop our umbrella and we were happy. There is no beach service that far away from the hotel but you're just a 40-foot walk to the beach bar. The doctor: I had the opportunity to require the services of the in-house doctor and was ... not impressed. Nor was I impressed by the Hospiten (urgent care clinic just outside of Playacar)... but I'll leave that for another review. All in all, this is a good hotel. Don't expect The Four Seasons (or even maybe the Marriott). But you get what you need... and more. I strongly recommend leaving the complex... it's tempting just to stay on the hotel grounds as you don't really \"need\" anything outside... but just go. Hop on a cab or the ADO bus and explore a little... go to Coba, it is awesome! PM me if you have any questions.

We have been to all inclusives in the carribean before but this topped them all. No idea how people can complain about the food - it was amazing! Location - fantastic, beach is long, sandy beautiful and rugged with miles of soft sand to walk on and that turquoise water to stare at. The hotel itself is in a great location, many are very far out the way from anything so its impossible to walk out the grounds but this was perfectly placed in walking distance to a local shopping plaza through lovely streets and also a longer walk to playa carmen for shopping and nightlife The Hotel - Grounds were amazing like being in a jungle, fantastically landscaped and walking through them there were iguanas, peacocks and wild monkeys - beautiful! Even a flock of flamingoes on site - and parrots! The rooms - basic but nice! If you can afford it get a room with a beach view. The food - again the best food for an all-inclusive. Buffet restaurant huge choice and will the all-inclusive option you get I think 4/5 bookings for the restaurants; steakhouse, tropical, mexican, japanese and italian. Steak was the best I ever had - even in the UK and the tropical, seafood, was fantastic. Service is phenomenal too. Huge range of cocktails, good menu and they make anything you want. You really are spolit for choice. Facilities - We made use of some of the beach activities - yoga and beach volleyball which was fun and also used the tennis courts- but book early as they only have 2! Poll is lovely and landscaped very relaxing and not busy even at peak easter time. Could always find a sunlounger on the beach but get there early by the pool. Dive centre on site as well which was very good. Mexico itself is a beautiful place, so much culture to see and the people are so friendly and food wonderful. It really is a rich place to visit, with great wildlife onland and in the sea. Would highly recommend it and I would recommend this excellent hotel.

Met up with another family, also with 2 similar aged kids. Overall, great trip. The pool was very nice with zero entry. The designated kids pool was really for very young kids and more for splashing around in (only about 1 foot deep) so we spent most of the time in the larger pool. The water was very warm. The beach was beautiful and kept up incredibly well (seaweed all raked up in the mornings). The girls did the kids club (Lucy's) 2 of the days and enjoyed it. They started off the morning at 10:30 doing crafts, then went to the pool and lunch. We picked them up before they showed a movie at 2 pm. Kids seemed well supervised but we did put the kids in swim vests to have extra security in the water. The food was OK, about what I expected from an all inclusive. The buffets had a wide selection of meats, seafood, veggies, fruit. None of it was stellar but quite adequate. The Mexican specialties were the best - tacos, fajitas, guacamole, etc. One day, they made Paella on the beach which was terrific. They always had a outside grill with burgers, etc. The restaurant on the beach was a much smaller buffet and not very good. We tried 4 of the a la carte restaurants. The Mexican one we enjoyed the most. All of the restaurants have an appetizer buffet and then you order the entre and dessert. The Carribean restaurant was also pretty good and the service was excellent. The Japanese restaurant was a lot of fun for the kiddos who had never been to a Hibachi style place before. The Steak place was awful. The appetizers were mostly cold salads that weren't very good, the meats were only fair and they ran out of dessert. The waiter was so bad that we were pouring our own wine and water (we were sitting next to where the bottles were). The drinks were great. Decent amount of bars and bartenders very friendly. Did have poolside service. The weather was very humid and many of the restaurants are not air conditioned. The rooms are and we were nice and cool at night. The mosquitos were out in full force and I highly recommend bringing and wearing bug spray, especially after dusk. We did see them spraying every day around the resort. The rooms were nice, 2 queen beds and a chaise lounge. Small refrigerator that is stocked every 2 days with beer (4 of them) and water (can ask for more water). I found the beds comfortable but my husband and friend thought they were too firm. We did not participate in many of the activities due to being occupied by our kids. The gym was nice - 2 ellipticals, some stair steppers and a few treadmills and weights. Never very crowded but a bit of a schlep from the rooms. I tried one step class by the pool which was good. We took out kayaks one day for a little bit which was fun. You can take out the kayaks or Hobie Cats for an hour at a time free of charge. The shows did not start until 9:30 which was too late for us. However, went to the Magic show one night which was terrific. The other great thing about the resort was the jungle like feel. Kids really enjoyed seeing the peacocks, sereques (these large rodents), monkeys, and lizards, tortoises, and tropical birds. Monkeys were hard to find but we did find a few.

We have only ever been to Beaches Resorts before, which are much more expensive than Iberostar. It was myself, my husband & our 5 year old daughter. The grounds of this resort are just beautiful. There are peacocks, cereques (small rodent type thing), tejons (like a raccoon) & the occasional monkey roaming around. After reading many complaints about the front desk staff, I can say that we did not experience any problems with them at all. Always very friendly & helpful. Check in was fine, we were a little early, so we ate, & then the room was ready. Our room was cleaned everyday & the fridge is refilled every other day, but if you ask (and leave a $ or two), they will refill it for you. My daughter loved the different towel art each day! We were in building 25, which is about right in the middle, & it was a perfect location for us (even though we requested 21, it was full). The resort is not super big, so it\u2019s nice to not have to walk too far to get anywhere. The beds are really hard, but you can request for some extra padding, but they are still hard! We were there during Spring Break, so I am assuming it was pretty full, but we never had to wait for a table when eating meals. We got to eat at 3 restaurants (Mexican, Japanese & Steak) all which were pretty good. The buffet food does get old, but we are not too picky, & I was glad not to have to plan it, cook it & clean it up! If you want something gourmet, then you will have to pay way more than this resort charges! I would suggest that they get a better salad bar for lunch though, but the salsa & guacamole are delicious!! There is also an ice cream cart, by the pool/beach, the coconut ice cream is the best! I liked that waitresses come to the pool & beach area serving drinks. Never had that at a Beaches resort. The new beach is huge! Almost too big really, if you have young kids, you\u2019ll have to drag chairs down closer to the water, & I believe that you can get umbrellas to put in the sand, since all the pallapas are up close to the resort. You also need to get a spot at the pool early (so go before breakfast) & reserve your chairs. Like I said, I\u2019m sure the resort was at max. capacity, so I\u2019m not sure how it is the rest of the year. The towel shack doesn\u2019t open until 8am, so you can exchange your towels the night before, for dry ones. You have a towel card for each person, so you are only given 1 towel a day, but you exchange it for a dry one if you want. We just got our card back at the end of the week. There is a nice area of the pool that\u2019s walk-in, & perfect for little kids. Though I\u2019m not really sure why adults, that are there with no children, choose to sit in that area, when the rest of the pool is 5 feet deep & people with young kids to be in that area. The resort could stand to get rid of some of the plants around that area, to allow for more chairs. We just moved chairs around, to wherever we needed them to be, since my daughter was in the pool the whole time!! The Star friends did a really good job at entertainment. There were crazy pool games in the late morning & afternoon & they did games on the beach too. The kids club came out at those times too, my daughter never attended the kid\u2019s camp, but it was the same woman all week with them & she looked very happy to be with the children. Ages 4-12 can attend. It was also nice at night, around 8:15, they would do a kids show, or games, or some form of entertainment for the kids, for about 45 min. It was nice to sit around, have a few cocktails, & let the children be entertained. The adult shows were after that, but we only made it to one, since my daughter was so tired every night, from being in the pool all day. It was entertaining & the kids had fun at that one too. We went to Xcaret one day & did the dolphin swim \u2013 booked through Best Day ( I believe their booth is on the Tucan side). This is also who are travel agent booked our transfer to & from the airport through. We paid $70 round trip for 3 of us. I met a family that paid $90 for one way. We also took a cab one day to Playa del Carmen for $5. It\u2019s about a 5 minute cab ride. My daughter got her hair braided there for $40, at the resort they wanted $60. I felt very safe in Playa del Carmen (much safer than my previous trips to Jamaica).

If you come on a package and are given 3 meals at the restaurants, you can try to have more meals that won't count against your total if you check in with the conceriage the same evening to see if there were cancellations, if so, you can eat there and won't count against your total (3). I didn't care for the buffet much as there was a lot of fried foods and not very many healthy options but did think the homemade omelettes were good. Beds are hard but you can request an egg crate to soften. Also, stay away from building 28/29 as its loud and kind of stinky as its near the garbage. Refridgerator in room is nice to have and is stocked well with soda, beer and water. Note: if you leave a tip for housekeeping they take extra care of you...10-20 pesos ( $1-2)/day. Pool and Beach is nice. You may want to consider putting your towel out earlier if you want a specific spot. Entertainment at night was fun and worth going to. Liquour in the restaurant bars are top shelf however the pool side bar does not serve top shelf. Would recommend bringing an insulated cup to keep your beverage cold as they warm fast with the warm temps. Be sure to bring smaller bills so you can tip your wait staff ( even though its all inclusive). If you tip, they are more responsive for sure. Icecream and sherbet are great and available by the pool/beach for free. There are many fun activities on site to take part in, salsa dancing lessons, archery, yoga, bike tours daily etc. Workout room is nice with 3 treadmills, 2 stair steppers, 2 elipticals and a bunch of free weights. We did one excursion to Coba with zip lining, repelling into a cenote, visiting and eating in an authentic Mayan Villiage and canoeing and hiking. Our guide was HUGO and he was the best ! Be prepared if you go into town to shop that you will be minorly harassed to come to their store. Be sure to barter barter barter. Don't buy anything at the first few stores without walking through the whole area..things are more expensive at the first few stores in Playa on 5th Street. Hotel does have showergel in shower and shampoo ( but didn't like), hair dryer as well. Last tip..if you get invited into to a 'presentation' at Tres Rios..stay away ( its beautiful and they feed you a great breakfast) but the 90 minute committment you sign up for took us 4 hours so burned a good part of our day. We got a discount on our stay to go to this but was not happy about the actual length of time it took us to get through the presentation and it was definitely high pressure/high sales and some schmarmy sales people that try to convince you to buy in to the Private Residence Club.

No DVD player in the room; TV programming in English is very limited, and the picture quality is not that good. Although they have a policy prohibiting reserving hammocks, no one actually enforces it, so it can be real pain in the neck, especially around the pool.

As for the food, the selection was good; however, the quality was somewhat disappointing, although not bad. There are a few buffet-style restaurants and a number of 'a la carte' type ones, which I personally did not like. It was basically the same buffet, accompanied by a very limited choice of main courses cooked to order. Aside from the Japanese restaurant that offers a decent seafood dish and great desserts, there's no point to go a la carte. On the beach, they serve delicious ice-cream, a variety of spirits and soft drinks, and fast-food-type snacks. The entertainment is so-so.

This was our fifth visit to MX, second to PDC but first at this resort. We arrived at the Tucan side after an efficient airport customs and immigration entry into Mexico, about an hour after touchdown. We had booked non-stop transfers with Apple Tours and that worked very well. Check in was a breeze with a welcome drink in our hands in an instant. We had booked the Tucan through Apple Tours and were surprised when we were assigned a room on the Quetzal side. At first I was a bit bothered by this but as it turned out it was fine. For the most part the rooms are equal on either side. We were in building #24 and had a short walk to the beach/pool. The grounds are very well kept and quite tropical. Lots of animals running around. We saw many peacocks, ducks, flamingos etc. There are little rodent-like animals that are very docile. We only saw one of the howler monkeys in the trees but they made their presence known by, well, howling. We had a jungle-view room and would have been happier with a beach view but this resort doesn\u2019t have many that front the beach (mostly suites I think). As it turned out we spent so little time in the room or balcony that it didn\u2019t matter. The room is fine, clean and pretty much standard hotel room with a king bed, sitting area, balcony, mini-bar (filled every other day) fairly good size bathroom with shower only, television with movies only, small safe (not big enough for a laptop), iron and ironing board etc. The beach at the IB is beautiful. Very wide and very long. Lots of palapas on the beach and we never had a problem getting one in the morning. The pool is large and chairs there seemed to be at more of a premium. We did not hang out at the pool so it didn\u2019t matter. There is a separate kids pool and the swim up bar is also separate from the main pool. There is also a separate small pool for water polo, basketball etc. It seemed like there was lots of activity daily around the pool with the Star Friends (IB employees) engaging kids and adults in pool games. Hobie cats and sea kayaks are available at the beach. Hobies need to be reserved and if interested do that early in the morning for a later sail in the afternoon when the wind picks up. Food: The buffets were good, though a bit repetitive. Overall the buffets rate a C+ to B. Never had a problem getting a table or long service lines at either the breakfast, lunch or dinner buffets. We only ate at one ala carte (Tropical) and I can\u2019t say I was impressed. It was OK, but just that. Perhaps others were better but we usually did the buffets or were in Playa at dinner time and ate there. (On a side note, Playa is a $5 cab ride away and you are missing the fun of Playa by not leaving the resort and traveling into town. Lots of shops, bars and restaurants on 5th Ave.) Entertainment: We took in several of the shows and they were a good diversion after dinner. They have a different theme each nite and some of the shows were better than others but we seemed to like the several we saw. Drinks: Abundant and available pretty much everywhere. We particularly enjoyed the lobby bar on the Quetzal side and evening bartender Catalino who was efficient, friendly and humorous. Beer on tap is Dos Equis, and it appeared they had a good selection of liquors and also could make any of the tropical drinks you wished. Beer in the room mini bar was Superior though an occasional Dos Equis made it to the fridge I will say the service here was a bit lacking. There are four beers when you arrive and some days only one or none were replaced. I would imagine calling might get some service but I found it odd that they would replace the soft drinks but not the beer. All that said we never went thirsty. Staff: Very hard working and friendly. All the wait staff, bus boys, bartenders, housekeeping, everyone were super. Don\u2019t forget to tip. Overall we liked the resort a lot. It is quite large and really Tucan and Quetzal mirror each other so I don\u2019t think it makes a lot of difference what side you are on.

Even Better Than The Reviews\u201d", "Author": "RyanandCarolina", "ReviewID": "UR60865553", "Content": "My wife and I had our honeymoon at the El Dorado Royale in Puerto Morelos. We absolutely loved it. We decided to go back to the Riveria Maya for our 6 month anniversary, but wanted to do it on a smaller budget. Iberostar Quetzal Playacar got just as high of reviews for less money so we decided to check it out. On to the resort: Rooms: The rooms were nice. The A/C worked well but it seemed to be on a motion sensor so when we left for long periods of time it would shut off and turn back on when we re-entered the room. We didn\u2019t mind because the room cooled down quickly. The mini bar was restocked every other day and worked well. The room was always cleaned daily and we had great towel art!! The beds were hard and set on a concrete slab instead of a box spring. We didn\u2019t mind this one bit, but if you don\u2019t like a hard bed you may be in trouble. Resort Grounds: The grounds were awesome. Simply awesome. They have a forest separating the two resorts that share the same grounds. The forest has paths through it and there are plenty of wild animals including monkeys, peacocks, chickens, tortoises, toucans, and a ton of animals that I don\u2019t know what they were. It was really a great experience especially at night when the paths are lit up. All of the buildings were great and the performance area was covered which was nice the night that it rained. Food: We were there a week so we were able to go to a sit down restaurant three nights. We choose the Mexican place, the steak house and the Italian restaurant. They were all good, the sit down dinners were not quite as good as El Dorado, but they were adequate. The Mexican restaurant had a Mariachi band that came around and sang. The other night and for breakfast and lunch we went to the buffets. There was always plenty of fresh hot food and a ton of variety. You can eat at one of the pool site restaurants or the burger station outside and most days they also had a specialty station outside like seafood. Beach: The beach was very nice. There were a few sandbags but it didn\u2019t matter to us. If you walk along the beach south for a few resorts you get to some pristine gorgeous beach without sandbags and without a ton of people. Day Entertainment: They had classes that you could attend, dance lesson, and pottery painting. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more, it seemed like there was always something going on. Night Entertainment: The night shows were fantastic. They really put a lot of time and effort into the different performances. We skipped the first night because we were tired from our flights and it was a mistake. I would love to see any of the shows again and again. The people in the shows were great and come out and hang out with the crowd before the shows and work around the pools during the day. They had some cute interactive things for kids too. Bars: There were bars everywhere and they were always happy to make you a custom drink or something off of their menus. They were always smiling and polite and fast to get you a drink. We hung out in the adult pool quite a bit and we received over the top service down there. Recommendations: We took a walk around Playacar and checked out the houses and shops. It is a very nice place. It's nice to get off the resort and experience the area. Also if you have a choice, choose Lomas Travel for your airport transfers, they were WONDERFUL. Just walk past the other transfers and look for the guys in the teal shirts in the back. They don't hound you about going on trips or spending more money like the others. As you can tell we were had a great time and are thinking of going back. It would really be hard to top this resort within a close price range.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cOverall good trip...\u201d", "Author": "can'twaittoleave", "ReviewID": "UR60771366", "Content": "While this was not our first visit to the Mayan Riviera, nor to an Iberostar resort, it was our first visit to the Quetzal. For the last two years, we have stayed at the Grand Sirenis much further down the coast, but our fond memories of the gated community of Playacar and other stay at an Iberostar resort prompted us to book here. Our traveling group was myself, husband, 3 kids (ages 14, 12, &10), and my in-laws who we took along to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. If you read my other reviews, we are easy to please and although I only write reviews on whole family vacations, our traveling experiences range from five star (i.e.: Le Tousserok in Mauritius) down to 3 star. We had a rough start to our stay here. Upon arriving, we found that my request to have our rooms in the middle of the resort had been completely ignored; they had wanted to place us in the 27 room block. I was irritated because I had requested this since it is hard for my father -in-law to get around and wanted to be in a central location. In all of our years traveling to the Mexican Riviera, I have always had my requests honored and they are always to have a unit close to the ocean (which I think would be a more difficult request to honor). The fact that we were return Iberostar customers was even more disheartening. They did, in the end, put us in the 24 room block, which worked great for us. So, here\u2019s the scoop\u2026 Rooms: Very small, no dressers (this is typical for the area), large closet, nice little balcony, bathroom with shower, beds are hard and pillows not the greatest (also typical for area/hotels of similar caliber). Bring your own hairdryer if you have long hair-their hairdryer is not so great. Super small safe, it will not fit a laptop, think twice before bringing one with you). The second part of our rough start was our first full day there. In the time it took us to go to breakfast and get situated on the beach, our room was cleaned and my son\u2019s IPod Touch was stolen from his zipped backpack. Now, he knows better, but it really blew our first day there as Iberostar staff will come to your room and go through your belongings for an hour and half to file a report, but did absolutely nothing in the end. Make for sure everything is locked up! The rooms are not maintained as well as the grounds and other buildings. We had a clogged drain when we arrived. It was fixed within 15 minutes. Other little things show age like brown spots on mirror edges, mold along some of the cracks in the bathroom, remnants of where the hairdryer used to hang on the wall, etc. Housekeeping did a pretty good job each day, but our sheets were only changed once in the 8 days we were there and often the big jug of water you use to brush teeth (water is not potable in the bathroom), was left unfilled/not replaced. Grounds: The grounds here are some of the most gorgeous we have seen during all of our travels. They are meticulously maintained and feature a wide variety of plants and animals. You walk through the jungle to get everywhere on the resort. There are waterfalls, fountains, peacocks, koi, turtles, monkeys (including a cute little baby), and colorful beautiful buildings. We especially enjoyed eating in the buffet area for breakfast each day as they are open air, but netted so you are not bothered by birds. Pools/Beach: Adult looked nice, but we didn\u2019t use it. There is also a playground with a kiddie pool if you have little ones that is very nice. The main pool is beautiful. There is also a sport pool for basketball/soccer that is nice. The beach is absolutely beautiful-believe the colors in pictures you see, the water is spectacular. There are pieces of coral on the beach, so watch your feet (this is the whole beach for all of the resorts in the area, not just the Quetzal-they are still working on restoring the entire beach since the hurrucane). There are lots of chairs and palapas available in both areas. We were there during spring break, so we had to reserve early, or you won\u2019t get one. Don\u2019t believe the little note Iberostar gives you when you get there. While they will not be responsible for your towels/belongings being removed from chairs, if you don\u2019t reserve them, you won\u2019t get them. Food: Consistent with our other Iberostar stay, the food is truly as good as it gets in an all-inclusive. We ate both at the main buffet and the beach buffet. It is what you make of it. Excellent Mexican pico de gallo, red sauce, green sauce, & guacamole! My husband loved the burgers by the beach. Look for the carnitas at lunch and in the mornings for the fresh chirros (to die for). Lots of selection given the amount of people they serve. We ate 2x at the Mexican restaurant-delicious, and once at the Japanese (much to our surprise, one of our favorite meals there). No problems getting any reservations, even with a group of 7-I was pleasantly surprised. Be sure to try out the lobby bar, their best alcohol is there (also some of the best cappuccinos you will ever have) and the atmosphere is extremely relaxing, just lovely. We were there every evening. Service: Almost all of the staff here is extremely pleasant and will go out of their way to make your stay as wonderful as possible. Although the service is the same whether you tip, or not, please be sure to tip generously as they work extremely hard for so little and a couple dollar tip goes a long way! Other: There is a little shopping plaza up the road (5 minute walk), worth a look. Shopping in Playa del Carmen is a $5 cab ride away. Be sure to check out our favorite restaurant, Yaxche, we love it so much we ate there twice this visit, gourmet Mayan cusine, absolutely outstanding service, and a wonderful atmosphere. We also rented a car (there is a car rental right inside the resort with pick up and drop off right there) and spent time driving to different places including Chichen Itza/the colonial city of Valledolid-totally worth the time it took to get to both places. There is a lot of concern about safety. We never felt unsafe, even at night in Playa del Carmen. Don\u2019t be afraid to be adventurous, just be smart about it as you would be anywhere else in the world! Wi-Fi/Internet available at $13/day. Didn't use fitness center, or kids club.

Walking the streets was a little creepy because you are haggled, but we went to a place called Fusion, and it was awesome (chicken quesadillas not on the menu). Easily found a cab back to the hotel. I agree with others that the beds are hard, but I have a bad back, so it was fine for me. There are some peacocks around the hotel that are extremely loud early in the morning, so getting a room closer to the beach is recommended. The drinks were plentiful, but there were alot of young people there who were first time drinkers. There are also a ton of kids. I stayed mostly on the beach, and it was much quieter. The pool seemed crowded, and warm. The beach was easy to get a chair and hut for some shade. They also had activities for people who wanted to do them. The staff was friendly outside the main lobby who did not really understand courtesy and going the extra mile. You will have confusion and maybe some anger with the front desk at some point.

We will always stay here!!! This place was amazing!!! Our stay was from Saturday February 27th through Friday, March 5th. Here\u2019s the breakdown\u2026 Check In The employees were extremely pleasant. We received a welcome drink upon arrival which was really nice. We took a red eye and got in before check in so we had to wait three hours which we will not do again. My husband and I went to the lobby bar and played card games. It was nice because we were the only people at the lobby bar and every time we took our last sip the bartender/cocktail waitress was right there asking us if we wanted another one. Rooms: Our room was 2650 (third floor) which faced the Riu Yucatan. We could not see the Riu but had a view of the trees and cave below. I liked our room. The beds are hard and next time I will request the small foam pad but it wasn\u2019t horrible. I\u2019m guessing they do not have dressers and soft beds because of the humidity. The bathroom shower was really nice. Next time I won\u2019t pack shampoo or bath gel. They had dispensers in the shower which was really nice. The bath gel smelled really good. I will back a hair dryer and a mirror. I didn\u2019t like the dryer they had and the mirror had small scratches on it which made it difficult for me to put on my makeup and my husband to shave. Maids/Room Service: Wow, the maids are amazing!!! We left them $2/day with a note requesting more water, beer, and cola and each time they gave it to us. Two of the days they gave us a huge jug of water. Each day we would also have towel art on our bed. We had room service two nights. It came quickly and the pizza and tacos were the best!!! Food: The breakfast is the best! Please try the chaya juice. It\u2019s really good. The buffet does get a little old after awhile. It\u2019s still worth the price but next time we\u2019ll probably go out to dinner. (See my other reviews for places to eat in the area) We went to the Japanese restaurant and had what we thought was a brand new chef preparing our meal. He didn\u2019t do as much show stuff as the others and he way over salted the food which made it inedible. We also went to the Seafood restaurant , which I also believe was the Caribbean restaurant, it was good. Drink Service: Hands down the best drink service I have ever had!!! I don\u2019t even get that type of drink service in a restaurant in the states. Whether it was the beach, pool, our lounge they are very attentive! Resort: This resort is so beautiful. The jungle feel and the animals are so amazing!!! The pool is cold when you feel it but after you get in it\u2019s really refreshing and not cold at all. Just jump in. The pool is absolutely huge and never crowded. I had to play the towel game at other resorts but not this one. There were always chairs available. The palpas are really nice and they are all over the pool and beach. The resort is also located in Playacar which is a gated community inside Playa Del Carmen. My husband and I walked around town at night and felt safe. The shops are close by and they even have a Starbucks there (thank God!) The lounge was really nice and they play jazz music overhead. At night they have music performers come into the lounge and play. Very relaxing feel! Overall the best vacation ever! Next time we\u2019re staying for ten days! For excursions we went to Rio Secreto and Puerto Morelos Snorkeling Reef Adventure. I have reviewed them as well.

We ate, walked around, took the kids (4 & 6 at the time) to the beach. Food was pretty standard. The kids loved the Japanese. Buffets were good. Pretty standard drinks, Dos Equies beer on draught, rum drinks. Nothing really high end, but not rot gut either. Pool was nice, big. But like many other resorts, you're forced to go out and put a towel on a chair before breakfast if you want a place to sit. The kids loved the ice cream cart that came around. The beach was nice, really big surf when we were there. I liked it, but had to watch the kids like a hawk, it was a bit too rough for them. Adult pool is in a hole, off to itself. It is mostly shaded and therefore cold. It was usually pretty wild by late in the afternoon, but no kids, so that's ok. Entertainment at night was preety cool, they usually had something for the kids before hand. Kids club was outstanding, my kids wanted to go everyday. They fed them, watched movies, swam, had a beach olympics, they loved it. The jungle in the middle of the resort was really cool. Monkeys, peacocks and other assorted creatures roam freely.

There were always plenty of chairs at both the pool and beach. The food was average. We tried the japanese, seafood, and italian. We liked the Japanese the best and the Italian the least. I will say all the wine selections were poor. We tried several types of wine and never found one that we enjoyed. The buffetts were good with lots of choices. Okay, the beds- they were horrible! I mean the worst mattress I have ever slept on. Service was good in all parts of the resort. We had no complaints. We did not have kids with us, but there looked to be lots of kids to do. We took a cab to Playa del Carmen, which was a 5 minute taxi ride. 5th Avenue had shopping and restaurants. You do need to ask if they accept credit cards because some do not.

Then we stepped out on to the balcony and were face to face with a loading dock, garbage area of the building next door. We immediately asked (politely) for a new room. They claimed they were fully booked, but would look into it. That night, and every night, it was too noisy to sleep (we even had to keep the sliding doors closed because of the smell). The slamming metal doors, breaking glass and loud trucks kept us awake every night. we had to keep the TV on just to drown out the noise. We asked to be moved every day. We even spoke to the on-site Apple representative. No one ever accommodated us. Almost everything else about the resort was wonderful. The only other disappointment was that we weren't able to book any reservations in the specialty restaurants with the exception of an 8pm seating one night (out of 6 nights). They advertise the restaurants, but you aren't able to get a seating, so this is about the only false adverstisement they have.

We wanted to try a resort closer to the airport so we booked at Iberostar Quetzal. Easy check-in - Omar at the reception desk was so charming - loved him. We were thrilled to find out that they upgraded us to an oceanfront room in Building 20. It was great to have that view of the ocean and we were close to the pool too. The room was clean and the safe was easy to use. Walls were paper thin - so if you get stuck next to loud people that don't keep the same hours as you - you have a tough time getting to sleep. I played the towel game every morning - had our stuff on chairs under a palapa by 7 am to make sure we got the exact spot we wanted every day. The beach is huge now and there are plenty of chairs/palapas. I like to get a run in early before it gets too hot so it is not a big deal for me to play the game. It was nice to have the sidewalks to run right outside the resort in the little Playacar village - easier than running loops around the resort like other places. Their workout room is okay - weights, 3 treadmills, 2 bikes, 2 stair steppers and 2 ellipticals - all of which were in working condition and relatively up to date. Just kind of a small room. Food was not the best - I am picky though but was pretty disappointed anyway - I thought it would be better for some unknown reason. My husband is not picky and he didn't even like it. We know that you don't get the best food at an AI - but just disappointed in the lack of variety and choices. They did have good french fries at the lunch beach buffet and good ice cream by the pool. I gained a few pounds on the trip so I didn't go hungry - probably all those fries and ice cream! The jungle animals are very cool - make sure you walk around both sides (Quetzal and Tucan) so you see all of them. Wireless internet is available for $13/day. We never did that. My husband would buy 15 minutes of time on one of the lobby computers for $2.00 every night before dinner to catch up on email, b-ball scores, etc. We also walked 5 minutes down the street to a Starbucks one day with our iPod touches - could use their wireless for the cost of a cup of coffee. We found that the Riu next door had free wireless when we went to pick up people on the last day for the airport - if I had known that I probably would have walked over there instead of the Starbucks and used their wireless out on their big front veranda. The service here is great - best I've seen in a long time. Cool towel art every day in the room, refill of the room refridgerator every day, quick on the drinks in the buffet.

We stopped at one resort to drop off other guests and we were at the Iberostar within 1 hour of getting on the bus. Check in was relatively simple, we were notifed upon checking in that the beach was under construction, so we had the choice of staying at this resort, moving to another resort or taking a bus daily to the beach 40 miles away.

We took a day trip to Couzmel on the tour set up by Omar. it was OK - not sure if it was worth the $60.00 per person. Like all all-inclusive resorts the buffets can get a little tiring, but as long as I didn't have to cook who cares. We dined at the Steakhouse twice and the Japanesse restaurant - both were very good. No complaints with us. Yes, just like all the other reviews of this resort, the beds are very hard, but you really didn't notice it so much after 1 night. The Star Friends are quite talented. We attended 4 shows all were very entertaining. It is possible to get \"lost\" at night following the trails around the resort, but you just listen for people talking and you can find your way back. No big deal. All paths lead to a bar, you just grab a drink and continue on. The weather was great 80-85 all week, one night of rain, but with all the foliage, you didn't even notice it.

I have stayed at an Iberostar in the Dominican Republic and found the service to be the best. I very much expected this when booking this trip and I was not dissappointed. I looked at so many resorts and I am extremely picky when it comes to access of facilities and great service. This facilitiy has the best staff service I have ever experienced. Cecilia\\Analley Front Lobby Bar\\Waiters Breakfast Buffet/Beach Bar Guys Are Hilarious/Front Desk Check In (sorry if they are spelled wrong) all were awesome in providing a fun friendly atmosphere. I cannot comment on the house keeping staff, as on vacation I always hang the no disturb on. I am rarely in the room and generally not too concerned if is it cleaned each day. I did notice the resort was not overly crowded and wondered if this was because of the economy or the beach renovations but whatever it was made it easy to get a chair at the beach or the pool with ease. It was the closest Beach Bar/Beverages I have ever experienced complete with sand walking friendly waitresses. The service at the beach was great and the drinks were cold. The only complaint I have is I found the beds very uncomfortable and too hard. I like a soft mattress so I improvised with the couch cushions and made it more comfortable. I enjoyed the Jungle atmosphere and it gave an impression that you were deep the true Mexican Jungle complete with exotic animals like the tzereque (spelling may be off but they are damn cute little guys) peacocks, birds, lizards, turtles, the elusive monkeys, and fish. There are well lit lush vegitation stoned paths with an ancient mayan feel with hidden stone statue secrets. The best part is its plants and trees seemed so mature and grown that it beats any of these new resorts with sparse hand plunked palm trees and miles of concrete. The beach was spectacular and from what I was told has been made much wider. It was extremely wide with the white sand and aqua water you want to see on a vacation. I travel 95% to see a beautiful beach and nice water so this is very important and I was worried about all the beach renovations postings on here. I must have went at the best time as the beach was totally accessible and the best I have ever seen on vacation including all the way down it walking to Playa Del Carmen. The food choices were endless on the buffett and of course there were some repetitions however there are so many choices you will find something and it will be fresh and hot. I was not too keen on the Italien Restaurant's little buffett but the meal was very good. I really enjoyed the Mexican Restaurant buffett and my meal was excellent. I wish I had used the Pool Restaurants more as on the last day I ate lunch there and found new choices and enjoyed them too. The pool area was large with the lush vegatation and many little secluded seating areas set up in inmitate sets of two. The pool bar is very cool complete with moveable under water stools and lots of bar space including a separate bar room like seating for a larger group. Easy access aisles and not an overly cramped feeling. I use the ocean so I never did swim in the pools but water was warm and it looked great. We walked down the beach to Playa Del Carmen and it was the best part of the trip. Great spot set right on the beach with the memorable 5th Avenue. Complete with cool shops, bars, street fire shows and the Cozumel Ferry. Check out \"Pepe\" at La Gloria Mexicana Restaurant Bar near Ado Bus Station as he made it a great little stop in bar to get the feel of the area. We went on a one day tour of Xel-Ha and Tulum. It was incredible at Xel-Ha with the most beautiful scenery and wildlife. A must see and do for whoever likes to snorkel and enjoy natural surroundings. Tulum was very cool and I learned a few things I was unaware about the Mayans and exactly what took place in that era of history. Took some cool black and white pictures of the ruins. I am coming back in October and I would consider staying here again, but with the Iberostar Chain I really want to try all of them. The Quetzal was an excellent choice if you are looking for great service, jungle atmosphere with wildlife, wide white beach and a large pool area. The problem it that Iberstar resorts always have that so I am going to start a bucket list of all of the different Iberostars I want to see in the world. This is not a plug, but it seems these guys have what a vacation is supposed to be and I only get two a year and I like them to be very memorable and enjoyable.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat New Beach\u201d", "Author": "kentandlinda", "ReviewID": "UR55952015", "Content": "Just returned from Quentzel and the new beach is GREAT!

While advertised as separate properties, they are in fact one (a mirror image of the other in physical build - but the Quetzal is more \"fun\" with its more jungle-like atmosphere). We had a private transfer from the airport which is worth every single penny. We are not bus people and on a previous occasion were stuck on a transfer for 3 hours dropping off other bus riders along our way to another property (2008). My husband and I are admittedly food snobs and enjoy staying in fine hotels so read this review with that in mind. The pros: This property is a \"fun\" property. With an eco-friendly design that has done well to incorporate a jungle atmosphere among its walkways and buildings, the \"feel\" of the property is enough to send us back to this property alone. On our last trip to the Playacar/Playa del Carmen area, we walked the resort area and stopped into many of the other area resorts. We love the more authentic Mayan/Mexican/Caribbean feel (palm frond roofing, open air lobbies, cultural icons) of the Quetzal/Tucan in comparison to the formal, Spanish Colonial feel (formal, imposing) of the other resorts in this area. The in/outdoor seating for the buffets makes eating breakfast more enjoyable (and really, you\u2019re in the Caribbean and SHOULD be able to eat outdoors \u2013 who needs windows!). The lobby bar is well-stocked, the servers are friendly and most attentive, the occasional guitarist was good (live music is a must on any Mexican vacation), and the drinks were well made. During the day, the pool area is a nice place to relax and the beach is absolutely one of the best. While some reviewers complain of the \"whales\" - we loved them and found ourselves jumping on/off them with kids a third our age. The white sand beach stays surprisingly cool to walk onto, there is a nice bar nearby, ice cream is served just off the beach in the afternoon (try the coconut ice cream!), and the outdoor showers are perfect to rinse your feet as you return to the pool area or room from the beach. Yes, the towel game is played at this resort but we did not mind this as there was always room for new visitors to the pool and beach - it is simply a matter of location. Those who arrive early get better seating (in terms of sunning, bar accessibility, etc.). The palapas are AWESOME and maybe my favorite part of this resort. The beach is also conveniently located near the resort rooms (versus some of these resorts that require a \"hike\" to even see sand) and is kept immaculately cleaned during the day. In the early morning, cleaning crews can be heard preparing the property for the day but you can't complain about that if you are equally interested in keeping the resort property kept and free of debris (including palms which are whisked away with guest garbage). In other words, the property is extremely well maintained. The staff is very friendly - maybe too much so as the Star staff is occasionally pushy when trying to entice guests to participate in group activities (think \"Dirty Dancing\" without the \"dirty\" or \"dancing\" - more like the wig scene). The freshly prepared omelets (and other freshly prepared foods at the buffet) are quite good and I recommend them to keep you feeling satisfied for the day. The cons: In general, the food is not fantastic (mediocre for dinner while fine for breakfast, lunch, and snacking). Again, we are foodies - but really, who thinks they are going to get top-of-the-line food at an all inclusive (I should know better by experience and others' reviews). There are limits to what can be expected! However, Playa del Carmen is a short cab ride away and exceptional dinner can be had here (especially Yaxche on 8th and Madre Tierra Restaurant overlooking 5th \u2013 both a MUST!). The beds are (as others have said) pretty darn hard. Surprisingly so. We requested several extra blankets which were delivered (a few days later) to pad the bed. I have never slept on a comfortable bed in a Mexican all inclusive resort (as with food, non-all inclusives are an exception). Odd! Two of our party did get food poisoning at the Italian restaurant (I'd avoid this one as the food was nothing special to begin with). The steak restaurant was serviceable and the staff was more accommodating here. As for on-property entertainment, first, I must say that the property itself is somewhat its own entertainment with a variety of vegetation and animals to keep one entertained walking between destinations or just wandering during the day. The evening entertainment is hit-or-miss with some evenings being okay and others, well... think \u201cDirty Dancing\u201d (again) but not the behind the scenes entertainment (now that would be a different story altogether and probably not postable). But to give credit where it is due, the Star Entertainers are amazingly energetic \u2013 hosting activities all day and then getting gussied-up to put on a show which (all things considered) is not too bad. In all, the beach, pool, location, atmosphere, and staff make up for the shortcomings in the food and bed comfort categories. In all honesty, I would likely not stay at any other all inclusive besides the Quetzal/Tucan if I were to return to the Playacar/Playa del Carmen area (which we will). Its uniqueness is just that... unique. It makes any vacation that much more enjoyable and for the price, maybe I'll mail a bed pad down to the resort ahead of time next time and just plan on dinner in Playa del Carmen!

Guests used to be greeted with a welcoming drink, but that has not happened to us for a few years. The women at the desk was in-training and her supervisor never put in an appearance to assist her. She had to make frequent trips to the back room for information. I had confirmed our reservation and requested some specifics for a room and if possible a particular room we had stayed in before. These seemed to be new information to the desk clerk. Happened the last 3 years also. The women at the desk was pleasant and none of the problems were her fault. Eventually we got to a room that was near where we wanted to be. We like the hotel because of the people who make it go - dining room staff(Diega, Marcos, Daniel, Leonardo), bartenders, drink waitresses(Yadira at the pool area in particular), maids(Mary Magdelena), etc. They are always friendly and pleasant(whether you tip them or not). The food is varied and well prepared. There are many choices at any given meal. The dining areas are neat and clean. I was disappointed that the hotel has chosen to save money by only offering their best liquor in the lobby bar and not at the pool area. This is a change from our last visit. The change was noticeable not only to us but to the other people we spoke with. This cheapened their view of the hotel. It made them feel that the drinks were also watered down. I don't think they were, as the bartender would put more liquor in if asked, but more cheap liquor in a drink, is just more cheap liquor in a drink. The rooms are clean and maintained so by the maid staff. Our maid Mary Magdelana was outstanding. The chairs at the pool have improved somewhat. For the past few years, many of the backs kept collapsing when you tried to lean back to read. At times it sounded like a gun range. The problem still exists, but they have either replaced some of the offending chairs or there were fewer guests. I would like to see the chairs with arms to assist in getting out of them. (Not a problem when you are young, but as you get older your knees don't work as well.) The exercise room is poor. They do have ellipticals, bikes and treadmills that are relatively new, but the weights and universal and benches are something most home gyms would have junked long ago. It was a chore to get the key lock to work in the universal and it needed to be lubricated. Some of the people I spoke with went to the gym spent 5 minutes and left. They were very disappointed in it. The gift shops at the hotel are notoriously overpriced. Also they do not use the established exchange rate. They will take US money but only give you Mexican money for change, even when US dollars are clearly visible in the drawer. THe hotel is near a shopping area - Playacar. It has some very nice shops and although they are not as prone to bargain as some of the shops in Playa del Carmen, they are close and have a good selection. We are not nightlife people, but the hotel has a disco and in house entertainment each evening at the Star Show. Some of the shows are quite good and entertaining. We prefer the Quetzal side of the hotel complex as it has birds wandering about(peacocks, etc) a pond with flamingos, ducks, swans. The Tucan side is a little more formal. There a 2 buffets, plus 2 at the pool for lunch and continental breakfast; a grill area for hot dogs, hamburgers, etc. 4 specialty restaurants- Steakhouse, Mexican, Italian, Japanese. All things considered, I prefer the buffets, although many feel that the Japanese and Italian are exceptional. I think it would be a good idea for the hotel to have a scale at the lobby area where you are picked up and dropped off to check baggage weight prior to getting to the airport. With the way the airlines are now about baggage charges it pays to know if you are under the weight or over on the bags and get that adjusted prior to arriving at the check in. We have met people and made friends at this hotel and see them every year. There are things that the hotel could do to make it better, but just the same we will be back.

The hotel itself is just lovely, very Mexican-influenced and jungl-y, complete with all the fun wildlife already noted on this blog, monkeys, peacocks, flamingos, and some kind of crazy large guinea pig from what I could gather, very cute and friendly. The staff were super: helpful and not pushy at all. However, don't forget, this is MEXICO, the indigenous people here are NOT on our time frame! If you go there in a big hurry to do anything, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED! The food was way better than I expected, and I am a foodie! Don't get me wrong, its not gourmet and its not for food snobs, if you are really such a food snob, spend the extra dough and go to a gourmet all-inclusive or eat out, there are tons of restaurants around. However, there is always something fresh, like fruit or salads, made to order omelettes, fresh salsa and guacamole, all with no chemicals! They make breads and pastries at each meal, and there was always food available any time we wanted to eat. The ala carte restaurants were just okay, but again, on the good side of okay. I found the steak restaurant to be better than the japanese, but we only dined at those two aside from the buffet. In every restaurant, the service was great! No problems getting served, having refills, having dishes cleared etc. Even at the beach, which was WAY less crowded than every other neighboring resort, our drink service was awesome....Let me mention here that although this is an all-inclusive, a dollar or two goes a long long way. Be a sport. Everyone everywhere likes money! The property had a beautiful little spa, I took advantage of the lovely outdoor jacuzzi and plunge pool, and the tiny, though steamy, steamroom, all for free! We borrowed a hobie cat and went for a lovely sail along the beach, again, for free. Never did I feel like I was a pest to any employee at this property, the staff was gracious at all times. I ran each morning in the neighborhood, usually pretty early, say 6-ish. The streets were clean and I felt safe as could be, a woman alone in a foreign country...While running each day, I passed ruins from centuries ago (incredible!), beautiful beaches, sacred places, and more friendly faces than I can shake a stick at. I've run in worse neighborhoods at home. We rented a car from Thrifty, which happened to have an office onsite, and did a little exploring, to Tulum and to Playa del Carmen for some shopping. It was a great idea for us ladies, but definetly not necessary, there are plenty of cabs and tour companies as well as local buses to get around. We booked our car in advance from home and paid only $21 a day, which was a steal! The cabs and tours add up, also, you'll be stuck with lots of other people all day. This place is a little gem compared to a lot of the gigantic neighboring resorts. No concrete high rise, no screaming disco music til 3am.

All of the A La Carte restaurants were great too! We would highly recommend the Japanese themed restaurant. Really entertaining and lovely food! The pools were fantastic and cleaned several times a day. The beach was spotless and had a lifeguard. One of my fav things was the ice cream cart by the beach. Served all day every day, with a choice of 3 different flavours each day. Totally free!!! Entertainment was samey as with all big AI hotels, but the Star Friends go out of their way to make you enjoy the day time and evening entertainments. The wildlife was out of thid world! Monkeys roaming freely around the whole complex, and Tucans and Parrots being brought round each day for photos and cuddles. The location is great. 5 minute walk to local market and 25 minute walk (or \u00a33 taxi) into the main town and night life. Dont forget to visit Coco Bongo!!!!

Each evening, a great show with a theme. Very professional and beautiful to watch and listen to. One night - a hilarious one with four couples competing for a prize. We chose to tip extra and received excellent service. Each day we discovered a different creature made out of towels, left on our bed by the chambermaid along with flower petals and chocolate. The beds were confortable enough. The architecture of the buildings was very tasteful and the colors warm and inviting. Excursions are available but very costly.

The resort is still as beautiful as ever and very well kept and the animals are still in abundance (howler monkeys, flamingos, peacocks, tortoises, iguanas, cats, roosters, etc.). Our main reasons for returning to this resort are first off that it is built within a jungle and ecological area with hacienda style buildings (no highrises) and is so beautiful, secondly is the locations. The resort is in Playacar, a secured community with resorts, beach homes, shops (Starbucks), a golf course, tree-lined cobblestone roads, sidewalks, ruins and only two miles from Playa del Carmen which is a great walk or run, or a $5 cab ride. Being a repeat customer, we emailed the resort ahead of time to make our a la carte reservations for the week and they honored the request. This was so nice to get the days and times we desired ahead of time. We also were able to be in the building we requested (although we did not get the floor or side due to the resort being overbooked) and we received Iberostar T'shirts in our room the day we arrived. Just a few little perks. We did feel that the food was not as good as it used to be, but we feel that they may also be affected by the economy and have had to make some cutbacks, but we got such an amazing deal that we couldn't begin to complain. Our best meal was our last night at the steak restuarant. The tendorloin and the salmon were amazing. It is our tradition to spend our last night at the steak restuarant and we are never dissappointed. Helpful hint we discovered this year. Our bed was harder than I have ever remembered so I contacted guest services and asked if the had a pad for the bed. They did and while we were out the remade the bed with the pad and we slept perfectly the remaining nights. In the past and due to so many stays with the Iberostar, we did feel the entertainment in the evening is ver repetative, but this year we were pleasantly surprised with a few new shows and a few new acts. What we did love was the Iberostar band that played many evenings and included live music and singing for many of the shows rather than the awful lip-sincing. The band and signers were very enjoyable and quite talented. Although we do not have a child that could attend the daycare, we did pay attention to them as we saw them around the resort and were amazed at how well they were taken care of and how great the two girls were with the children. They seemed to take great care of them (we have used them in the past, but they seemed better than ever this year) and enjoyed what they were doing. The cutest thing we saw that just has to be mentioned is that they actually worked with the kids one day to prepare and put on a production of \"Cats\" for the early entertainment in the evening. They called it \"Mini Cats\". All of the 20+ children were in full costume and preformed on stage to some of the songs for \"Cats\". They even had some props. After the preformance, the children were giving certificates for their performances and then were off to the disco, children only, for an hour. It was so adorable. A couple other things, the free kayaking and use of the snorkel gear is always great. Not great snorkeling in the area, but if you walk about a mile south of the resort you will see a variety of fish. We were a little taken back by the large sandbags that line the ocean along many of the resorts in Playacar, but we realized it has been done to protect the beaches which are wonderful in the area and worth protecting. They did not at all take a way from our vacation and left plenty of space for enjoying the beaches and the ocean.

OK for adults/relaxation.\u201d", "Author": "Amy26", "ReviewID": "UR50360522", "Content": "On the whole I agree with most of the positive consensus in these reviews, but I think it is important to note that this resort is really designed for families, and as such, families were 60-75% of the clientele while I was there (Nov 25-29). While the majority of the other guests including kids were fine, if you\u2019re looking for a relaxing adult setting, and also don\u2019t really go for the show/entertainment aspect I recommend trying somewhere else. That aside, here are the things I liked or was underwhelmed by. Nothing about the resort really deserves a total thumbs down: Great/Good: -Beautiful, well maintained grounds. The main paths of the resort crisscross through a jungle-like area with all sorts of exotic animals roaming freely. -Staff, especially wait staff and bartenders are great, a pleasure to be around. Nearly all speak English but you\u2019ll have the best experience if you try to speak/learn Spanish with them as much as possible. Tipping is certainly not required but I can\u2019t imagine you wouldn\u2019t feel obliged given the staff and service. -Drinks were generally good. The lobby bars have higher end liquors such as Absolut, Bacardi. They only have the cheaper varieties at the other bars, but mix it up into a tasty beach drink, and who really cares. Not sure what type of beer they were serving, it was decent but not Dos Equis as some other reviews said. It looks like they used to serve it, but now the taps are blank. The cups they serve drinks in are small for beer, maybe 8 oz. -Rooms are nice for what you\u2019re paying. The beds were hard but no problems sleeping on them. They have egg crates available on request. -Beach: Nice, plenty of shade if you want it. The area right in front of the pool gets pretty crowded but if you walk in either direction it thins out. No problems finding a chair. OK/Underwhelming: -Food. You get what you pay for, so I can\u2019t really say this is a true complaint because the resort is not expensive. But, the buffet food was mostly mediocre and seemed to be the same, although often presented differently, every day. With that said, the breakfast buffet was consistently good. The only reservation restaurant we tried was the Japanese restaurant, and comparatively, it was good and we enjoyed it. The burgers, hot dogs, and fries by the beach were pretty standard, but enjoyable. Side note \u2013 if you get tired of the food and are looking for some authentic local fare, try El Fogon in town, a few blocks from the tourist district. EXCELLENT and reasonable. -In room min-bar: On the plus side, there is plenty of bottled water available. On the negative side, they only re-stock every other day, when we only got either 3 or 4 beers (some Dos Equis, mostly Superior). - The toiletries in the room weren\u2019t exactly fresh. For example, the bottle of \u201cShower Gel\u201d was about 25% used when we arrived. -Beach service: not really existent. While there was 1 waitress serving the beach, you pretty much had to flag her down and the wait wasn\u2019t worth it. She was working hard, but there were way too many people for one person to serve. They also had a tough time keeping up with all the cups/trash people left on the beach (why people do this is beyond me). Quite a few cigarette butts in the sand. -Check-in/Check-out: For both, we had to wait about 15 minutes because there was only one person staffing the desk.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cHad a Great Time but.......\u201d", "Author": "Gunner1dallas", "ReviewID": "UR49228678", "Content": "This was our fifth time going to Iberostar Quetzal, and first with our 5 and 8 year old girls.

We actually booked an ocean front suite at the Tucan. Our first experiences at the IB Tucan were off to a poor start with a rude front desk clerk at check in, no bell boy to help with our bags, and the air-conditioning in our room did not work. A maintenance man came twice within 2 hours to fix it. But worse than any of these other things, my husband and I woke up in the middle of the night feeling very itchy; I flicked on the light and realized we were covered with bugs and sleeping in an infested bed. After a shower, we ran to the front desk and wanted to check out and get a refund. But the hotel would not refund our money and did not apologise. It was one example of poor customer service. After demanding to speak with a manager, (the same guy who checked us in the night before actually laughed at us - I am not joking) we were given a room on the Quetzal side of the property. Our new and improved room had a much nicer view. If you are reserving an ocean front junior suite definitely stay on the Quetzal side. The view is so much better. The rooms aren't super luxurious, but they are comfortable - and we loved our new room's location. The rest of the trip was great. We enjoyed ourselves so much, in fact, that we would even stay there again! Even after the bad start! Before going, I read many reviews, and most of them were spot on. So here are our two cents regarding the Iberostar Quetzal: 1) The food is ok, it's not horrible - it's not great. Their Mexican food is actually pretty good. 2) The mixed drinks (especially pina colladas and straw. daquiris) are awful, not even consumable. 3) The grounds are beautiful, lush and mature. The resort is clean, well-designed, comfortable and well taken care of. 4) The beach is very nice. Beautiful sand, clear water, etc. Yes there are sandbags - who cares. After a while, they begin to look like jettys. 5) Stay on the Quetzal side. Our Quetzal room appeared to be newer and better maintained. That's it!

I'll avoid repeating what you'll find in most of the positive reviews here - the info provided here is quite accurate. Read about 15-20 reviews and you'll get the idea. A few people will find problems, but I suspect they are quite hard to please folks. We traveled with a group of our closest friends; 10 couples, all 30- to 40-somethings for a no-kids getaway for 4 nights. The thing that stands out the most for me is the service - the people at the Iberostar do their best to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. A few examples: 1) For our group, we were allotted 1 \"reservation\" for a 4 night stay. Not only were we able to get all 20 into a seating at the Japanese restaurant (even though they couldn't get us at the same table), we also managed to dine with big groups in the restaurants every single night. We just had to check with the concierge later in the day, and they did what they could to accommodate us. Steak house and Mexican were nice alternatives to the buffet (which was just fine as well.) Japanese is always fun - our group had both the top chef (most experienced), and the \"new guy\" who was shaking as it was his 4th time! no worries, food and fun was good. The \"sake\" was questionable, but fun to share anyway. 2) We are football fans, and our hometown team was playing on Sunday on TV. There isn't really a TV/sports bar anywhere on resort, but after asking the front desk, the StarFriends were engaged to help us out. They managed to open up the Disco (which has flat-screen TVs) and tune the game in for us. We were the only ones in the empty place, but they left us to enjoy. They even sent the bartender from the main bar over to check on us for drinks every so often - incredible service! Hats off - this is what I've come to expect from Iberostar. 3) The pool \"closes\" at dusk, but one night we were a bit rowdy and having a good time as a group. Security came by to check on us, but just to see that all was well and left us to enjoy the evening. They could have hassled us, but once they saw we were just having a good time, they gave us some smiles and moved on. (Well, maybe they were just checking out our wives, but that's cool too :) 4) Service staff will help in any way they can. Waiters kept an eye on us in the restaurants to bring special shots; bartenders would mix anything we wanted, and even put it in our insulated cups we brought. If you think the drinks aren't strong enough, just ask for an extra shot - they're happy to oblige! Whether you tip or not, they provide the same great service. However, as others have pointed out - these people work HARD so you can forget your troubles. Definitely bring some $$, turn 'em into pesos, and spread the wealth - even though they don't let on, you know they appreciate it. All in all another great Mexican trip. It's not a 5-star experience like you'd have in Vegas (food, accommodations) but it gets a 5-star rating for me for the experience that it is. In Vegas, you'd pay for 1 meal what it costs here for a whole day of food, drinks, and your room!

While this was my 1st time staying at this resort it is not my 1st time to the area. While it was a very short trip, it was very relaxing and we had a great time. I booked this trip with Funjet and no problems at all with them. I have used them before. We used the transportation that was included with the trip, but I will not do that again. It took forever to get to the resort, as we were the last ones dropped off. I will pay extra from now on and have a direct/private transfer to/from the resort. Trust me it is worth the extra $$. Once arrived at the resort we checked in and was given our room key and we told here you go, someone will bring your bags to the room soon. I asked if someone was going to take us to the room and they said they were all busy but if we wanted to wait awhile maybe some could take us. The girls and I were very hot and just wanted to get to our room to change for the beach, so we walked. This did not give me a very good start with the resort. Once we finally found our room we were thrilled with our room. It was just steps away from the beach and we actually had a partial view of the ocean from the room, so all was forgiven for us having to walk to our room. Since we only had 2 full days they were mostly just spent at the beach. They have a beautiful beach. I know some people do not like the big sand bags that are in the ocean but they really did not bother me at all. We enjoyed just sitting on them and watching everything all around us. The water is just BEAUTIFUL!!!!! We did not get into the pool much because we are beach people. We can get into pools at home.. The pools were very nice and clean and it looked like everyone was enjoying themselves. We did get to see the monkeys that was cool!! Loved the ice cream..... The drinks and food at the resort were good. I do think the mix drinks were watered down some but that was OK for me but if hubby would have been with us not sure he would have liked that. We only ate at the buffets and while the food was really good I thought, I did not like that fact that the buffet did not have AIR. Breakfast was ok eating but we were hot while eating dinner. I really wish that 1 of the buffets could have air. I loved the fact that this resort was only about a 5 minute cab ride to 5th ave in Playa. I love going into Playa... We did walk one day to the little plaza that is right down the street. It was a nice plaza but the shopping is much better in Playa. We did have a great girls getaway. I got a really great deal on this resort and if I were ever to get that good of a deal again I would stay again, but otherwise I would probably always pick the Grand Palladium resort over this one. Don't be afraid to give this resort a try.

Safe to travel to Mexico, if you are scared to travel there-don't be. No safety issues at all in Cancun/Playa Del Carmen/Isla Del Mujeres. Actually I've been traveling for over 20+ years to Cancun along with other destinations in Mexico. I was there in March-Tucan and Oct 10-17th @ the Quetzal. This last time reminded me of when I first discovered Playa, not over crowded and a lot of Europeans. Americans as well. I'd guesstimate about 45% full - the entire town. On 5th Avenue there are tourists but it isn't like it use to be. Upon arriving I felt as if it were a ghost town at the hotel. We arrived approximately early 3:00ish and hit the beach. I was amazed to see so many empty loungers. Everyday I woke up to watch the sunrise @ 6:30 am I along with only about less than a handful of people were down there. I had my pick of loungers. Through-out the day you could find chairs everywhere. We're beach bums. The pool also had many loungers available too. The Quetzal only had three buildings open, close to the beach-which worked for us. The Tucan was full. I read the reviews about Mosquito's and never had problems with them ever. I'm fluent in Spanish and found out that due to the economy that like everywhere else management has cut down on spraying the \"jungle\" like areas, the whole hotel. My beau noticed immediately that the lawn wasn't cut (not bad at all) he just cuts our grass and knows when grass is tall. So this is why there all Mosquito's.(not bad - but I had about 2 bites) We went to Isla Del Mujeres as we always have and again empty. Not so many tourists. Could be many factors, economy and the other word I don't want to write that the world is experiencing. Trust me beyond a reasonable doubt we saw nothing of the sort and it's truly safe to go there. For the beach at Iberostar the waters are the most beautiful I've ever seen. This is why we will always go there for as long as we can. The morning we left, Saturday we took a dip early around 7ish. The water was the clearest I've ever seen it to be. Our beach by far is the best on the main hotel zone. RIU Yucatan next door , I stayed there as well has a nice beach too, but no palapas shade cover. Again literally your pick of loungers to sit on. Occidental , I stayed there too has no beach at all! The water is literally hitting the wall of the hotel. It has a small portion off to the side with a few loungers, but horrible beach. I believe it's the Royal Hide Away next to it with the same situation. I didn't go to Cozumel this time but our friends did. And were told the Cruise Ships don't dock where they always use to. Due to cost in price?? We use to see about 6-10 ships in the past from our beach of Playa not this time, maybe a handful if that during our 7 night stay. The weather was simply gorgeous high 90's! It rained one day for a tiny while, one night late and when we left on Saturday at the airport it was monsooning! For the Iberostar it's our hotel for ever, compared to all the other hotels we stayed at. The rooms are basic, stocked fridge big balcony and clean. Tip all the employees please they work hard. If you need a lift from one place to another call and ask and they'll pick you up, but tip them. We took $200 dollars in singles and were so happy to give them to the employees. It shouldn't be a question if you should tip, all inclusive means you paid the hotel owner, not them, they aren't our servants-they need to live just like you and I do ;-). The food is all good, I'll never complain about food, when the world has people starving with no food. So pack your bags and let's get the economy going and enjoy your trip to this wonderful resort. You will need a lot of sun screen, and a lot of topless women. Who cares, if you can't beat them join them! You'll never see these people again, ok what are the chances. We actually enjoyed not having big crowds of people, it was actually very comfy and fun, fun, fun! There are a lot of people in Cancun, but not like before. All the natives are very healthy and much fun. Make your reservations yesterday. If you have a massage, know you can have it on the beach but also know it's more relaxing in the spa. Air conditioned and music and candles with a sauna and or both whirlpool, cool and hot. I had two when we got there and the Friday before I left. In town they have Coco Bongo for young folks, and a lot of new clubs and shopping is wonderful. Internet was there for a small cost. You can use anything you want at both sides of Quetzal and Tucan, two different sides and two lobby bars that are quite inviting. A lot of families with beautiful babies/children. No drunks nothing bad.

We are beach people and loved the beach, even the sand whales that kept the kids amused all week...frankly, they had a better time because of them and we got some great pictures of them jumping and diving off of them. If you walk about 15 minutes up the beach to the right you come to a cove that is absolutely beautiful and uncommercialized. At check-in we got a 2nd floor room although we requested 3rd floor via email. They moved us the 3rd day, as promised, while we were gone to Chemuyil visiting the monkey sanctuary, which is a must see. They were so accomodating that they told us to pack up everything ready to move and they would move us while we were gone. When we returned, we simply turned in the keys to our old room and got the keys to the new one. Our new room had a great view and we were very happy. The rooms at the Quetzal are the same as the Iberostar Punta Cana and Dominicana. The jungle was fantastic and really a godsend when walking from the lobby to the beach or the room because it is really hot there in August.The jungle was shady and great fun with animals roaming all around. The first time we heard the howler monkeys we nearly jumped out of our skins because they sounded like King Kong. The kids went running out of the jungle they were so scared! I can't say enough about the service at the Quetzal. We have been 5 times to all-inclusives in Punta Cana - Iberostar Punta Cana, Dominicana & Bavaro and the Majestic Colonial twice - and let me tell you, the service at the Quetzal blew them away. No one ever said \"no\" to us and everyone had a smile and a \"Hola\". The service is great in Punta Cana but the Quetzal is amazing. Every thing we asked for was done right away - pillowtops were put on the beds, a cot was brought in, more towels - the people working there were the best. The food was ok. We ate in the Japanese restaurant twice and the steakhouse once. The steakhouse was good, the Japanese was better one time than the other. I may have been overwhelmed by the heat of the stove after being in the heat all day. The air conditioning in the Japanese left a lot to be desired. The buffets were quite good and we enjoyed the hamburgers at the buffet by the beach each day at lunch. It took me a few days to realize that the alcohol at the beach bar was so watered down that it was like drinking soda. So, I finally took my humongous thermal mug and trotted through the jungle to the lobby bar a couple times during the day where they made the most wonderful frozen lime daquiris. I guess the crummy drinks at the beach bar would be my biggest disappointment there. All in all, we had a terrific time at the Quetzal. The kids enjoyed it more than Punta Cana. We will probably go back again next summer and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a family.", "Date": "October 14, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NJ", "Title": "\u201cMexico in August, hot and humid, I should have known better\u201d", "Author": "elmo31w", "ReviewID": "UR46329313", "Content": "The average temperature when researched said 80-85 degrees.

The water clear and sparkling turquoise blue. Our room had all of the normal amenities that you would expect. I was neither disappointed nor blown away. The hotel maintained the jungle ambiance. The paths connecting to the pool, restaurants, and bars wind through trees that give the feeling of a time before resorts saturated the coast line. There were peacocks and large rodents (size of an armadillo with legs the length of a pig) crossing the path as you walk. There were also monkeys that would sometimes congregate on top of hotel buildings. The thing that was not so quaint was the dining facilities. After the first few meals in an open air environment, I looked forward to going back to my room to take a shower and cool off. It is not an enjoyable experience to have to endure the Yucatan heat and humidity while eating food that had spent too long under heat lamps, or not chilled enough to be palatable. The two or three restraunts that were enclosed did not have proper ventilation to be worthy option to the open air restaurants. I have stayed at a competitors Palace hotel at another location and now no that you get what you paid for. I will gladly pay up for the Palace atmosphere and service. Though I enjoyed everything else about our stay, I was sorely disappointed with the lack of comfort while dining. One more thing, the open air restaurant needed some sort of deterrent to keep the local grackles from flying in and snagging pastries off the serving table.

We were given a drink as we were checking in and they didn't stop flowing until we enjoyed the final beer in the car ride to the airport. The waitresses around the pool and beaches were excellent. They weren't around every day to take a drink order, but when they were they didn't forget you. The \"star friends\" were great! We enjoyed beach volleyball everyday, tennis in the AM, and the evening shows. When our remote needed replaced and our mini-fridge fixed they arrived right away and everything was fixed quickly. We started with a regular king-size bed room in the middle of the resort, but decided to upgrade to oceanfront for $50 extra per night. There wasn't much difference between the two rooms except oceanfront had the amazing view, a flatscreen TV, bathrobes, and a flower arrangement. The bathrooms are great, the shower is very big, although the bathroom door doesn't open all the way inside the bathroom, so that makes it hard to get ready in the bathroom unless the door is totally closed. We didn't have any problems hearing neighbors, although in our first room we heard very strange noises from the wild animals (probably the monkeys) in the middle of the night. The location is great, within walking distance of a small shopping center, which is where we were picked up for all of our excursions. This resort definitely has the biggest beach of all of its neighbors. There were plenty of chairs and umbrellas on the beach when we were there. It was a bit tougher to find them at the pool, but we never went without. All of the restaurants were great, but we enjoyed the Hibatchi restaurant the best. The breakfast buffet was ok, the view is definitely better then the food. The bars were excellent, they made any drink we wanted, and we got a bit crazy with our drink orders. It was neat to have our resort connected to the Iberostar Tucan. We actually spent more time at the Tucan bar in the evening then the Quetzal because it was a bit more livelier. The best part of the resort was that there was always something to do for all ages. We came without our kids, but definitely want to bring them in the future because all the kids we saw were having such a great time. We went on a few excursions, but we decided it wasn't necessary to do that because there was an activity scheduled every 30 minutes to an hour from 8 AM to 6 PM. I also thought the beach was beautiful and the pool was absolutely humongous! The thing we liked least about the resort was not being able to eat at one of the restaurants every night.

I decided to have my wedding here and Gabriella, our wedding coordinator, was superb!!! She was very responsive to all my questions and concerns prior to being in Mexico and was so attentive to all the details of my wedding day once I was there! She made me feel special and I never felt pressured to do anything I didn't want, and she never made me feel bad about wanting to do things differently than she did. I highly recommend this resort to anyone who wants to get married on the beach! Regarding the wedding, dinners and rehearsal; I had 20 guests and the hotel did a very good job in putting almost all of us into the same building (21-it was excellent, close to the beach and pool) which made it easy for us to meet up and get ready for the wedding, dinners, pools and such. (*Note: the Quetzal lobby/shops/buffet were all closed because of low occupancy so the walk to the Tucan lobby, shops etc. was a little far from our building, but we ate most of our lunches at the snack bar by the pool..they had quite a bit of a selection, just smaller than the main buffet.) They set us all up for dinner at the Japanese Restaurant the night of the rehearsal, the food there was fantastic! It was so fun! Our wedding dinner was set up at the Mariamba Steakhouse (the food was decent, I recommend the Tenderloin) which was perfect because it was close to our rooms for those who wanted to change, close to the beach bar where our private cocktail party was set up and close to where our wedding pictures were being taken. One thing that was a little confusing, that I didn't realize until we were down there is that the rehearsal dinner reservation counted as one of the a la carte reservations for my guests...so be aware of that. The Guest Services also got us another reservation in for our entire group at the Italian Restaurant for our last night all together, however, I had to be put on the waiting list and I had to put up quite a fight for it. The taste and quality of the food overall was decent, I'm not very picky and I found something different I could eat every day. My husband is Extremely picky and couldn't stand the food, he also hadn't ever been to Mexico either so I think his expectations were a little too high. It isn't like our food back home! The staff are all very friendly and seemed to always have a postitive attitude, I'm not sure how they do it! We had a good time with the bartenders, the Star Friends and the servers. The maids did a good job keeping the rooms tidy (the flower petals they put all over the beds get a little annoying after a couple of days though) and they kept the fridge well stocked, a couple dollars tip throughout the week never hurt. I had fun with my family and friends participating in water aerobics, the pool games, the scuba trial in the pool, beach volleyball and snorkeling. It adds so much more fun to the trip if you get involved in the activities and volunteer at the shows when you can! Speaking of the shows, no, they aren't Las Vegas material, but it's something to look forward to each night and out of all the resort shows I've seen, the Tucan/Quetzal put on the best ones. I participated in Miss Iberostar and had a great time, we had participants from our group in dancing and other contests so it really made it fun! Like in so many of the other reviews, there is a plaza shopping area about 10 min. walk from the hotel. One thing that I wasn't expecting was how safe this walk was. It's in the hotel district of Playa del Carmen, so the street is kept up really nice and most everyone walking around is either staying or working at a nearby resort. We also went in to Playa del Carmen (50 pesos+ tip or $5.00 U.S-which includes tip) one night. For anyone wanting to purchase souveniers, Playa is the place to do it, I got ripped off on my T-shirts, shot glasses etc, when I bought most of my things at the plaza. Overall, we had an outstanding trip and all of my guests complimented me on my choice of hotel. I chose it for the price (not too high, nor too low) and for the location. There weren't many college kids wanting to party hard and there weren't many children roaming everywhere either.The beach was beautiful despite the sand whales and the color of the water is like nowhere in the States!

Rooms, very roomy and immaculately clean. the beds are hard as the matteress rests on a concrete plinth but I didnt mind this as I like a firm bed. Air-con and ceiling fan was a massive hit. Grounds - all I can say is amazing, beautiful stome paths that wind from the beach to the reception area past all the apartment blocks and it took us ages to walk anywhere because we stopped every few steps to look at all the wild life. we saw everything from peacocks to the local guinea pig type animals and even had a monkey sat on our balcony one afternoon. the reception area of both the quetzal and tucan sides are beautiful with loads and loads of seating areas to relax. food - lovely, we tried every speciality restaurant and the buffets both in the reception area on a morning and evening and the buffet around the pool area. plenty of choice from burgers and chips to traditional mexican fare. The mexican coffee with rum or tequilla was a lovely treat at the end of a meal. the staff in all the food places are wonderful and very helpful.

Beach, acres and acres of brilliant white sands, loads of sunshelters and if these are all taken then you can get umbrellas from the towel booth near the pool. The sea is wonderfully cool and so blue. the beach has huge sandwhales to stop the erosion and we took breadbuns from the buffet and snorkelled around these, the fish come and take the bread out of your hands. loads of free water sports to do on the beach. there is a lovely cool breeze blowing most of the time on the beach and I found it more comfortable than the heat around the pool. staff - everyone from the reception staff to the groundsmen are wonderfully helpful and always greet you with a happy Hola when every you meet them.

The mozzies made a bee-line for me and I did bet quite badly bitten. but others in our party didnt so I must just taste nice to them. we went on 2 trips - a half day to Tulum, which was beautiful but very very hot, take your beach stuff as you have an hour or so on the beach after visiting the ruins.

The staff were great, and the restaurants were great as well. Whenever you want something they will get it for you immediately, or the staff will before you even think of it. The only things I didn't like was that during the day there was plenty to due with pool, beach, and booked excursions which I was able to do straight through the hotel in the main lobby at a reasonable price (swim with dolphins, horseback riding, visit to Chitzhen Itza, and snorkeling), however at night there is really not much to do. What I mean is that each day they have one show that lasts for hours on varying things, and they are NOT VERY GOOD partly because there are too many kids around to conduct audiences for the mature audiences. Kids under 18 will probably be very very bored at night, there were probably six children in our party who fell into this category who were complaining every night because there was nothing to do, this includes a 17 year old who was not able to hang out at the clubs at night with his brothers and sister, and cousins who are over 18. This group was not able to go into either category and I wish the hotel would provide something for them, Lucy's kid's club did events that were for very young audiences (under 7). Also there is an actual jungle inside the hotel, where howler monkeys, peacocks, cuccobarrows, turtles, flamingoes and lot of animals roamed free which was amazing to be in. Overall I really enjoyed this vacation, and really was an all inclusive, I never needed to have money on me during my stay since everything was included. The only thing I ask is that you tip the staff, who are always hardworking, most are Mexican and speak little English, but they try their best to please.

Two adults and 13- and 17-year old boys. Towards the front of the property, marble walkways meander through lovely jungle gardens with koi ponds and fountains. Towards the back are stone paths through thick jungle. Lots of animals and wildlife that are right there but somehow keep separate from the human population. We saw monkeys in the trees, Mexican agouti (like a large guinea pig), parrots, flamingo, peacocks, lizards, iguana. A toucan in a large cage, two large box turtles in a pen. The pool is huge. Lots of lounge chairs on the beach. We never had a problem finding a place to hang out. Food was very good, even though it was a buffet. Wait staff was friendly and quick to bring coffee or drinks and clear used plates. One thing, if you go there bring one set of casual dress-up clothes (khaki pants for men, pants or a sun dress for women) so that you can go to the specialty restaurants that are included in the all-inclusive price -- Japanese, Caribbean, Mexican. We had only shorts so we didn't meet the dress code. A nice touch: they keep the mini bar stocked and you don't pay extra for it. Beer, colas, bottled water, bottled fizzy water. There is little difference between the Tucan and Quetzal sides. Tastefully decorated throughout. Rooms were cheerful and clean. We were in adjoining rooms, second floor in building 14, Tucan side. Our room faced inward, towards thick jungle; we did not even need to close the drapes for privacy. We could hear the entertainment from our room at night but it was not a problem.

I traveled solo with my 14 and 11 year old kids. There are activities going on all day, but also quiet spots if you prefer, as we did. The good stuff: The rooms were immaculate; the resort is beautifully laid out with a landscaped \"jungle\" with animals (monkeys, peacocks, flamingos, tortoises, fowl) and winding paths and the pool separating the two sides (Quetzal an Tucan). The staff is warm, friendly and accommodating; the beach and pool are beautiful; there are many activities to take advantage of. You can drink the water, frozen drinks and eat all fruits and vegetables at the resort without fear of illness - they really do use purified water. Do not, however, drink from the taps in your room; this water is not purified but they provide you with free bottled water in the room. Use the bottled water for brushing your teeth as well. Criticisms: The beds really are hard as rocks (the mattresses seem find but they are on platform beds that are made of concrete) and the food was just OK. Also, there are no lifeguards. Accommodations: We had a standard room. I was dissatisfied with our original room (located in building 25) - It was dark, on the first floor, with a shabby bathroom and right next to the jungle with no view of anything other than trees. I requested a room change and within a few hours was moved to a much nicer building (Building 21) at no extra cost. This building was much brighter and very close to the pool and beach. We had a nice balcony with a really beautiful view of the beach. What a difference between the 2 buildings. The room was very clean and definitely big enough for the 3 of us. It had a king bed and a little couch that they made up as a bed for one of my kids. I think, however, that it would have have felt much smaller if my husband had been along and would probably suggest a junior suite for a family with 2 adults. The maid service was excellent. We had a refrigerator that was stocked daily with soda, bottled water and beer and everyday we came back to these animals made from towels on our bed and flower petals strewn on the bed or as part of the towel-animals. It was really cute. Beach: We are beach people and the beach is really beautiful. The white sand and turquoise water you are dreaming of. There is erosion and there are giant \"sand whales\" (giant burlap bags filled with sand to prevent further erosion). However, this really did not detract from the beauty or interfere with our enjoyment of the beach. You do have to be a bit careful though when the \"whales\" are covered by water, I did catch my foot under one. My understanding is that the water is generally rough but we did not find this. On most days it was very calm and on 2 days there were nice gentle waves to ride. We never had a problem finding chairs. There seemed to be many palapas for shade and you could get umbrellas from the towel guy. We preferred to stay in the sun and protect ourselves with lotion as the breezed kept it quite comfortable even in August. A word of warning - While there is a lifeguard chair, I never saw anyone in it, so you really do need to keep an eye on your kids. Pool: The pool is huge and really nicely set up. It is shared by the Quetzal and Tucan, both really 2 sides of the same resort - and separates the two sides. It sort of winds around so there are many sections of this one gigantic bath-water warm pool. together. You can find quiet private sections or if you prefer more action, the main pool has one of those gradual entrances - this is where all of the activities take place. It was a bit too loud and rah-rah for our taste, lots of microphones with \"Star Friends\" leading activities, but lots of fun if that's what you like. There are activities in this area throughout the day - giant pool volleyball, water stretching, water aerobics, water polo... Again though, if this is not your thing, we never had difficulty finding chairs in a more secluded spot. There is also a separate adults only pool with a swim up bar and another 5.5 foot deep pool with basketball that the teenage boys seemed to really enjoy. Again... no lifeguards, so I was never really comfortable snoozing. Activities: There are free activities throughout the day - at least 2 every 30 minutes. In addition to the pool activities noted above there are ping pong contests, Spanish lessons, dance classes, air soft gun tournaments, soccer tournaments, bike tours, yoga, stretching, archery, catamarans, wind surfing, 2 pool tables, diving demo in pool, to name a few. For extra money, you can paint pottery by the pool, get a henna tatoo, massage, have your hair braided, go parasailing, go on a snorkeling or diving trip or jetski. There are shows every night put on by the staff. We only saw the beginning of 2 shows - they seemed kind of hockey and required audience participation. Not our thing, but lots of folks seemed to really enjoy them and the theater was very nice. We were so tired by 9:30 that we usually just went up to our room to sleep after dinner! Food: The food is OK but definitely not gourmet. The buffets are the same everyday and this gets pretty boring. I think most people find what they like and stick with it. We stayed for 7 nights and they guaranteed 3 restaurant reservations and this was all we were able to get. Then ambiance in the restaurants was very nice and the service attentive. The food may have been slightly better and at least there were some different things on the menu but not much better. Our best meal was at a Mexican Restaurant in Playa del Carmen. Delicious! Overall, I think the value was excellent. We had a great time and I would definitely recommend this resort.

So what did we enjoy? - Infectious happy/welcoming atmosphere about the whole place. - Good quality accommodation. Relatively spacious, reasonable furnishings and very clean. Mini bar restocked regularly at no cost. Very nice. Yes beds a little hard but we had no problem sleeping. - Resort well maintained and very clean. 'Jungle feel' goes down well with kids. - Meals were good to very good. Plenty choice throughout day (hot, cold, etc.) for adults and children (Mexican, US or European) and available round the clock (via room service if you wish). Speciality restaurants (we had five reservations for 14 nights) were good - did Mexican, Italian (best in our view and one of restaurants that was air conditioned) and steak house - all were all worth a visit. Service first class. We tipped regularly because staff deserved recognition for their efforts. - Drinks / cocktails (local brands pleasant but international brands freely available too)throughout resort. Bar staff also work very hard to please. - Arguably best aspect of hotel was the great entertainment team who work incredibly hard day and night. Ton of games, challenges, audience participation events if you wish to get involved. Some of the evening shows were better than others but most were watchable or better. - OK beach with fair choice of watersports. - Range of people from Mexico, US, South America and Europe.

Very small gripes - mosquitoes can be bit of a problem for some people (take an insect repellent), birds flying in and out couple of buffet restaurants needs addressed, and organised trips or extras (massage, watersports, etc.) little pricer than elsewhere we've been to so allow for this in your budget.

Sounded like a loud car engine along with a loud hum. Called for service, they came, fixed problem, we all went back to bed. We woke up again at 4am to the same noise but now added a low muffled horn blowing sound to the commotion. Finally after working on the problem for about 15 minutes we asked the to move us to another Ocean view Jr Suite. They gave us the okay and the room selected was on same floor, just on the corner. At 5am, we repacked all our stuff and re-located. All was good until we moved wet clothes back to the balcony and the sliding glass door handle fell off. We screwed it back on and went to bed. The next morning I was cleaning up morning coffee and went to pour it down the sink in the bathroom and the coffee came out the bottom all over the floor. There was no pipe fitting under the sink in the bathroom. Called front desk to have them fix the sink and the sliding door and the sink was fixed. Had to call on the sliding door again later since no one ever came to fix it. Didn't get much sleep the first night but the rest were good. The pool is unusually hot - swimming in hot water on a hot day is not what I enjoy but others did seem to enjoy the warm water temp - felt like a hot tub.

We can't say enough about the hospitality...you feel like you get to know the staff on a first name basis by the end of the week. They remember you and go out of their way to make you feel special. We ate all of our breakfasts and 3 dinners at the buffet; it's not high quality, but there's plenty of selection and we always went away satisfied. We tried 3 of the specialty restaurants...Italian, Japanese and Mexican. Our favorite was the Japanese restaurant, but at all 3 the food was fantastic. We enjoyed the more formal atmosphere at these restaurants as a break from the bathing suits and shorts attire at the buffet and beach-side restaurant. We also enjoyed the evening show each night...lots of energy, music, and dancing. Our excursions included a half-day trip to Tulum (take bugspray!!!), a taxi ride into Playa for shopping, and a visit to the new XPLOR park which is owned by XCARET. The XPLOR park was billed as \"high adventure\" in that they have zip lines, cenotes that you can paddle and swim through, and an amphip 4x4 ride. Our teens loved it, but the zip lines will wear you out...lots of climbing stairs to get to the top of each station where you launch. Don't go if you're afraid of heights or claustrophobic..the two main attractions (zip lines and cenotes) will have you atop 3-4 story towers, or you'll be swimming in an underground river for 30-45 minutes.

The Room - We arrived late and were put into a room in Tucan. Very clean, and accomodating. After walking around the property we decided to upgrade 6 nights to Ocean front suite. (50% off deal =$200). We loved our new room. It was directly off the ocean and had beautiful views. The rooms are very spacious and clean. Bathroom has a big shower with double shower heads, fun to shower with your other after swimming all day. We left a small tip for housekeeping everyday, and our room was always taken care of. mini bar filled. towels/etc stocked. No complaints! The pool - was huge, and warm. we are beach people, so we never understand the \"pool\". But it was always crowded more then the beach. We would swim in the ocean till 6. then relax for an hour in pool, shower and head off to dinner. The Beach - is amazing. we loved the beach here. At first we thought the big sandbags in the pictures would be awful, but they ended up being some of our funniest moments. They are there to protect the beach from rough currents and beach erosion...well they have a algea covering which makes the big bag like a slip and slide, we loved playing on this in the waves. We are big beach people. There were always chairs and palapas available. There is a lovely girl that comes around to serve you drinks. Give her a small tip and she will take care of you all day. The water is warm. We walked down the entire hotel coast line, and in our opinion Iberostar had one of the nicest and fun beaches. There is beach volleyball. We tried to kayak everyday, but they kept putting a red flag up, due to clouds....this was annoying but i guess one drunk in the ocean can mess it up for everyone. We rented jetskis and had a blast. The grounds - Iberostar has done an amazing job with the design of this resort. It is encompassed by natural jungle surroundings. You walk down little paths surrounded with nature to get everywhere. This also keeps your journeys a lil more private. The resort has a gang of howler monkey's, which are so much fun to watch.., iguanas, these wierd rodent things, tucans, peacocks, etc...just stunning. There are beautiful lush trees, a waterfall. Both sides of the resort are different, make sure you venture all around. You never know where the animals are hanging out. Decorations were very nice. very asian teak, meets caribbean modern.. As a designer i loved it! They are always cleaning everywhere. Iberostar has doe=ne a great job with the staff they hired and maintaining their lovely resort. The food- ok the buffets were average. We were not thrilled at all. But my boyfriend and i didnt really care. We ate enough to be healthy and thats it. There is a snack buffet by the beach, that we would snack off of all day. fresh veggies and fruits..etc. The room service has GREAT nuggets de pollo:) i ordered chicken nuggets for breakfast a couple time. As for dinner, this is where we put all of our excitement into...The reservations. You only get 2 with a 6 night stay, but just keep asking for more they will work with you. I actually made 2 reservations in the Quetzal reception, and 2 in the Tucan reception. Dont know where the disconnect for them was, but we got 4 reservations this way:) The Italian was our favorite! and not the noodles....order LOCAL fare, this is the best way to eat great. The red snapper, the grouper, the shrimp, all amazing. Everything about the restaraunt, the appitizers the desserts, the service, was top notch. we ate here twice!. The japanese was great. We tried octopus and the teppinyaki tables are really fun with other people. The mexican was great too. very gourmet style. We didnt eat at the steakhouse. You will be pleased. The drinks - the alcohol varies from bar to bar. The top shelf brands are in the two lobby bars. we would go here for a drink b4 dinner. The wines in the restaraunts are very nice, and im a wine snob. The beach bar is not great. but they are funny and quick. but their tequila sucks. We drank a lot of beer from them tho. If you are at the beach, walk into the Buffet palapa, which is very close to beach too, and have them make you margaritas. Jesus makes the best on the whole resort. And this bar has top shelf also. We like to drink all day, so you need the better alcohols for that! ahhah The entertainment - they do a great job putting stuff together. the shows were lame for me, but i live in LA. ive seen this all b4. but the beach activities are where its at. They actually made paella on the beach, and it was so good. i helped them cook it too. very fun to watch! The club was a bit young, im 28...but i still danced all night and the drinks are good in here too. The staff - the are there to cater and please and they do. they are just so happy to have you there esp. after the swine flu scare.... anything and everything i asked for was taken care of and promptly, no matter what it was. Overall we had a great trip! My boyfriend broke his foot on the first day there, so we really had to take it slow...whch in turn was spending a lot of time on the resort. We were very happy with our experience. And honestly I still cant believe how cheap it was. Some advice: tip! a dollar here and there, goes a long way in service. Use the safe in your room...we locked up everything valuable everyday. no excuses for anything happening then. Buy a cheap raft to use at the beach, we did this and were so happy. otherwise they sell them there for $15. Quetzal and Tucan are the same resort. there are two sides of rooms/buildings, with 2 seperate lobby's, but the middle is cut through by all the restaurants, nature, entertainment, and meets together again at the beach. Book whichever is cheaper. Upgrade to ocean view. We chose this instead of an excursion and we were so happy to have a suite. The quetzal ocean suits were better becaus ethere was nothing obstructing our view. Tucan has a lot of palm trees on their ocean suits view. I say this because we had 2 days of rain and storms, and it was so nice, oredreing room service and sitting on the balcony watching the storm move over the ocean from cozumel in. We had a great experience. If you are not looking \"hoity toity\" luxury, youll love this place.

We have previously traveled to the Excellence in the Domenican twice and once to Cozumel on Carnival Cruise. The hotel was nice and clean. We had requested a non-smoking room on the first floor close to the beach. All were met, but the non-smoking, however like some reviews we could not tell that it was a smoking room, the bedding did not smell like smoke but also had to wait 2 hrs before getting the keys. A positive, was that the people on the beach actually walked away when you told them \"no thanks\" (tour people & hotel spa). We tipped the maid, and tried to give some to the bar tenders just $1, which they seemed way over excited about, apparently the whole 'all inclusive' takes effect because we noticed no one else tipping. We have been to other all inclusive but always tipped because we realized that an extra $1 or two really helps their low salary. One of the negatives would have to be the dinning arrangements (besides the taste of the cheap drinks and no bottled water available at bars to take to the beach). Depending on your stay is how many reservations you get. Well since we were 4 nights so we got 1 reservation. We tried to go back the other days at 4pm when they had openings open to everyone, but they would never have a table for 3 and the lady would not sit us at a table of 4. I guess as long as you are a party of 2 or 4 you should be ok, but we were really burned out on the buffet food, its pretty much the same for lunch and dinner, and after a day, its just too much. It would not have bothered us as much if our other trips had required the same, but the other all inclusive we have been to did not make you have a reservation, but this hotel feeds the Tucan and Quatel so I think they do not have enough room to do so. Highlights we liked outside of hotel: the $5 cab ride downtown to 5th ave where all the rest. (senor frogs) shops (cheap ones and also retail like diesel). The dolphin encounter was worth the $150 for my husband and 5yr old, and we also went to Xel-ha which was like a snorkel park. Both were worth the price and it was nice to leave to see the town. All of the staff in guest contact positions seemed to speak English well. Didn't use the kid club, never really saw any kids in it. Overall, we can't complain because of the deal we got on it, but next time we would rather spend more and not have to deal with reservations to eat and the atmosphere of the employee that hates their job but its a paycheck attitude. Although Cancun had a/c and concrete roads, we love Punta Cana way more. The hotel staff seemed to be a better/friendly mood, and they were able to bargain more out in town because they needed what ever money they could get. We felt that some stuff in Playa Del Carmen was over priced and they didn't seem to care if you left they were not that desperate to try to make a deal with you. So would I recommend it, sure if you get a good price. Ours was cheaper than Sea World or Disney and it included food & drinks. I can't imagine being there more than 5 days, we were bored. Getting a tan is great but it was hard for my son to play in the water. The waves were rough, and the rocks don't really stop the 'break' but that is a mother nature problem. Just take some extra $ to do some stuff, even the guy at the tour counter at the hotel said to make sure not to use your Credit Card unless you can see them swipe it. So we just pulled $ out of the atm, the front desk will break/exchange your $ for free.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgia", "Title": "\u201cSecond visit, already planning third!\u201d", "Author": "katerbugGA", "ReviewID": "UR33765210", "Content": "This was my second time at the Quetzal, first time was 5 years ago with family & friends.

Our main interest was the nature preserve on the property. A paradise of flamencos, peacocks, monkeys and tropical flora and fauna gave us superb photo opportunities. It is an attractive resort with a wonderful beach and the opportunity to observe the creatures in their natural state. We took hundreds of photos and were happy for the opportunity to be close to nature. Otherwise, this was just another all-inclusive on the Riviera Maya, uninspired rooms, an extremely rude bellman who did not speak other than to say \"Any questions?\" as he dumped our luggage inside the room and held out his hand for a tip. The room in question reeked of smoke, had an ironing board set up next to the bed and only sporadic air conditioning. After a long conversation with the front desk, who were telling us that there were NO non-smoking rooms with king beds (they found one quickly enough when we were ready to find another hotel), we were moved to a more acceptable room. The view was wonderful--jungle birds, monkeys, peacocks, beautiful trees and flowers...it was lovely and restful--until the families with children and the party people returned from their afternoon at the beach. It was sad to see drunken adults throwing food and beer cans at the tame animals, shouting at them and trying to frighten these poor creatures. The children were only slightly better behaved, playing 'catch' with their shoes in the restaurant and running around unsupervised. It is unfortunate that some parents assume that their responsibilities to watch their children end when a 'family vacation' begins. The hotel staff works hard enough without having to herd your children back to the table or (as we saw on several occasions), take non-swimming children out of a deep pool and back to a napping mother. Front desk: Cordial, but inefficient. We arrived an hour before scheduled check-in. The hotel was only about 30% full, yet we had to wait in the stifling hot lobby for TWO hours before our room was ready--although it was NOT ready, with an ironing board in the center of the room and a non-working air conditioner. Food service: Standard all-inclusive fare, not as much variety as some other resorts, but well-prepared, bland food. Food temperature was inconsistent. There was always a good selection of pastas from which to choose and the desserts were slightly better than average--a lovely lemon/ginger pudding and a chocolate mousse pyramid were quite good. There is a snack bar at the beach for those who don't want to walk back to the buffets. It is configured so that the smokers are seated at the edge and the non-smokers are placed in the center of the room, directly downwind of the outdoor hamburger grill. It is often so smoky that it is difficult to see. The selections are sparse, leftovers from last night's dinner buffet. There is a self-service refrigerator with desserts (last night's buffet remains), but the refrigerator handles are so filthy that one does not want to open it. The waiters try their very best. They remember your name, your preferred table and your favorite drinks. These hard-working people were laid off for a month during the flu scare with no notice. They deserve tips and are very greatful. The gift shop is extremely overpriced and the staff treats the customers like intruders upon their conversations or telephone calls. Conclusion: A wonderful opportunity to be close to nature; some really excellent photo opportunities for the serious nature photographer. However, one visit was enough. We will not be returning to the Quetzal (or any other Iberostar property). We have visited several other resorts in the area which are considerably more comfortable and hospitable.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Omaha, NE", "Title": "\u201cWe had a spectacular time, planning on going back every year.\u201d", "Author": "Omaha_NEAnneMarie", "ReviewID": "UR32883648", "Content": "We went to the Iberostar Quetzal in early March of 2009.

The 2 hotels are joined and surrounded by a forest full of exotic animals. Peacocks roam happily around, monkeys jump around the trees plus the waterfall next to the restaurants houses numerous birds to enjoy while you eat. The A La Cartes are fine, we tried them all. The Japanese is a great experience if you are not a regular to this cuisine, good food cooked by the Chef in front of your eyes, with a few tricks thrown in too. Sadly the locals are battling to maintain the beach and large sand bags now sit on the shoreline. Don't be put off by this as the beach here is great, and the sea warm and clear.

The jungle at the resort is fascinating. I never tired of the peacocks, although they are loud. They like to clamber up into room balconies and perch on the wall--if you want to avoid a heart attack, check your balcony before going out with your morning coffee. The beach was very nice. The water was surprisingly rough, and if it weren't for the sandbags breaking up the waves, I'd have been leery about going in. The red flag was out 3 of the 4 days I was there. The pool was lovely-bathtub temperature and clean. It's tough to find a chair after 8 a.m., but I usually just went to the beach instead. By afternoon, the pickings get easier. It was amusing to jog through the pool area at 7:15 and see 3/4s of the chairs reserved. Drinks were OK. The cerveza is Superior, which probably is equivalent to Busch Light in the US. Most liquor was bottom-shelf, but the theater and hotel bars had some brand-name bottles. I enjoyed the restaurant food. The steakhouse was booked the entire week I was there, but I did the Japanese, Mexican and Italian restaurants. I ordered a pizza for lunch from room service one day and was pleasantly surprised. The beach side grill was the best--a couple of burgers and chips with guacamole are just the ticket around 3 p.m., when the sun and drinks are starting to take their toll. The buffet was dissapointing, even for an all-inclusive--and I've stayed at quite a few of them. Grease, more grease, and lots of fatty, salty meat. Room-temperature milk (gross) near the cereal bar. Watered-down orange juice. I'm not too picky, but I've had better (and worse) at other places. By Thursday, I couldn't take anymore cholesterol, and found myself picking at some tough french toast and burned waffles. Service was fine. At check-in, the desk clerk tried to talk us into taking a junior suite at another Iberostar on Riviera Maya because the Quetzal was overbooked. After a 50 minute drive from the airport, there was no chance I was going anywhere else, but the clerk wouldn't back down easily. I firmly told him that I wanted my room here and that was the end of that. The room safe lacked instructions, which led to an amusing series of events whereby I called three different clerks and got three different versions of how to set the combination (the third time was the charm). Otherwise, staff were generally friendly and attentive. I am learning Spanish and bartenders and waiters obliged whenever I tried it out. Rooms were much as described by other reviews here.

The grounds were amazing, truly like being in a jungle! Like most people, I read a lot of reviews about the hotel and was concerned about a few things. There are only a few negative things I can say about the hotel. YES, the beds are hard as a rock, definitely ask for the egg crates when you arrive they will help but only a little. Do ask for a room AWAY from the Flamingos, they do make noise early in the morning. Our room was not near them so we were o.k. but definetly a concern if you are a light sleeper. We actually brought our alarm clock/sound machine and used it to drown out any \"jungle\" noises we heard during the night or in the mornings.

My review will be accepted by those who want to hear open and honest feedback or will be rejected by those who want to believe what they want to believe. The intent here is not to bash anyone or any hotel. My review will be broken up into several categories, rated accordingly on a 1 \u2013 5 scale (1 = poor and 5 = outstanding) and a tip if I have one. It is your right to agree or disagree however, please keep in mind that my opinion is there to help you decide on a destination. My 25 years of travel experience are mostly in the Caribbean and other warm tropical places. If you are in a hurry, you can skip down to the Summary for my review. AIRPORT (Rating = 3) The arrival into Cancun International airport was typical of any foreign destination. Our flight was uneventful and on time. Customs at the airport was quick. Once you have your luggage, you will be asked to press a button on a \u201cstop light\u201d mechanism. If you get the green light, you can proceed. If you get a red light, you have your luggage searched. (TIP: I think the trick is to get behind someone who just got a red light. The theory is that they will not have 2 reds in a row which would cause a traffic jam at the inspection table. Supposedly, this is random.) Once you have cleared customs, you will be greeted by your newly found friends that try and usher you towards time share opportunities. Keep walking until you see you shuttle rep, unless you are interested in buying a time share. CHECK IN (Rating = 4) Check in at the hotel was smooth. While you are checking in, you are greeted with a punch drink which was very refreshing after a 45 minute ride from the airport. The bell men do a great job explaining the grounds and use a golf cart to bring your luggage to your room. Warning: there are no elevators in these three story accommodations. This will count as your daily exercise if you have a second or third floor room. ROOM (Rating = 3) Our party consisted of 2 adults and 2 children. Our room had 2 double beds (there is an option with one king bed). Our building was in the 2100 block which had a partial view of the beach and faced the adjacent resort. It was very convenient to the pool, dive shop and beach. (TIP: The 2000 block are true ocean front views) The rooms were very clean and service was great. The beds on the other hand were rock hard and extremely uncomfortable. This was a common complaint with other guests. The room did have a safe, stocked fridge and small sofa. (TIP: If you need a softer bed, try the sofa seat. We switched off every night as to who would sleep on it). GROUNDS (Rating = 5) The grounds of the resort makes this property very unique. As soon as you walk past the reception area, you enter a jungle-like atmosphere with wildlife all around. The restaurants are lined with waterfalls and streams which are filled with turtles and koi fish. The grounds are kept pristine and you will be welcomed by a variety of animals such as peacocks, turtles, roosters, flamingos, lizards, monkeys and an animal we could not identify. The stone paths to the rooms wind through the jungle and are shared with the wandering peacocks, monkeys (in the trees above) and the unidentified creatures mentioned above. Entrances to a couple of restaurants were by bridges over waterfalls inhabited by swans and other ducks. Bottom line\u2026 atmosphere is tropical and you feel you are in a jungle. FOOD & DRINKS (Rating = 2) This is where the resort falls short and does not live up to the Iberostar quality I have experienced. The food was bland and not fresh. There are several specialty restaurants \u2013 Japanese, steak house, Italian, Mexican and the buffet. Out of all the restaurants, the Japanese restaurant was good based on food quality and service compared to the others. The buffet was predictable and after the 3rd day I was disappointed with the food and quality. Literally, there was no taste to the food no matter what it was (fish, steak, chicken, etc.) Please understand that I am not a food critic and did not expect a 5 star food selection, however, the resort should try to make an effort to change the menu every once in awhile. (In reading the reviews for the food for this resort, I am amazed at how people think this was great. I am glad they enjoyed it and I will leave it at that.) The drinks are not top shelf and are brands that are weak in spirit. Our popular drink was a \u201cdirty monkey\u201d and several kids liked the \u201cfantasy\u201d Stick with the beer, it\u2019s consistent. BEACH & POOL AREAS (Rating = 4) The beach was beautiful and the sand was soft. The interesting part is that the sand always felt cool even during the peak sun hours. The beach is also lined with these big sand bags to help with the shore from not being washed away. During our stay, the waves were larger than normal and the lifeguards had raised the red flag meaning \u201cstay out of the water\u201d. It was interesting to see how several people did not follow the warnings and proceeded to swim in these conditions. The pools were kept in great condition and plenty of lounge chairs to go around. From the zero depth pool entrances to the water polo square pool, the workers were constantly making sure \u201cthings\u201d were picked up. \u2026\u2026WARNING\u2026The towel game is played at this resort. From what I saw when getting my morning coffee, there were towels out by 5:30am. There are some spots by the pool that have hut styles for lounge chairs. These are elevated double wide chairs covered by a thatch roof. They look comfortable and were \u201ctowel-reserved\u201d very early. I saw one family use the life preservers from the pool to reserve one of these huts. After he arrived to claim his spot, he put the life preserver on the ground next to the bushes and never put it back to where it was hanging. Some spots along the pool had easy access to the bars and restaurants. Other spots required a short walk to the venue of your choice. The adult pool was secluded and was never busy. I think that it may be due to the fact that it was not near the popular sections of the pool. ACTIVITIES (Rating = 2) There was plenty to do if you looked for it. Typical excursions were offered (scuba, snorkeling, etc) and a wide variety of resort activities such as archery, bocce ball, volleyball, etc. were offered everyday. The STAR players made a good effort to get everyone involved in the resort activities. They work very hard to provide these activities for the guests and I was amazed at how they were not tired by the end of the night. ENTERTAINMENT (Rating = 3) The nightly shows consisted of an 8PM kids show and a 9:30PM show. The kids show was directed by the STAR players who manage the kids club called Lucy\u2019s club. The two STAR players from Lucy\u2019s club were Michelle and Mariscella who provided the daily activities for the kids in the club. They were awesome and did an outstanding job with the kids. The 9:30PM shows were a hit or miss. There were some talented dancers and singers but don\u2019t expect a professional show. You have to understand that these STAR players are there all day and then have to put on a show for the guests on top of their other daily tasks. I give them tons of credit for working long hours. There are some bits of info which must be mentioned so I will add this to the STAR players section below. My expectation was low and I was neither surprised nor disappointed except for several instances which I will mention below in the STAR PLAYERS review. STAR PLAYERS (Rating = 2) Almost every all-inclusive resort has a group assigned to get the guests involved. Iberostar has the STAR players. As I mentioned above, there are some talented players and hard working STAR players that watch over the young ones. It\u2019s unfortunate that the one negative that was mentioned by everyone I spoke with at pool side or at dinner is that the attitudes of the main STAR Players were egotistical and pompous. I will not mention any names, however, the feeling that everyone got was that they would ignore you if you did not fit their \u201cclick\u201d. This was very disappointing and disgusted several patrons. The evening shows consisted of these STAR players selecting the same people for their audience participation versus going out into the crowd and engaging others besides the \u201cbeer-drinking buddies\u201d or \u201cafter hours buddies\u201d. The other event that was inappropriate was the fact the 9:30PM shows would surprise you with acts that were not suited for a younger crowd. There were no warnings about the show having sexual or adult themes and the show started right after the kids show. SO of course the kids are going to stick around. There are a number of people that were going to complain to Iberostar about the stripper on stage who decided to do his routine and show his butt and make sexual gestures with his genitalia to the audience. When several parents told the emcee, he just smiled and continued on showing know respect for the families with kids. At least warn the parents in someway so that they can decide whether to stay or not. Basically, these specific STAR players require you to adore them or you will be ignored. TOWN. (Rating = 2) The town of Playa Del Carmen is located about a 5 minute ride. The town is full of tourist shops where the vendors are trying to persuade you to buy from them. Although it looked like there were some infrastructure improvements going on, it looked like a hurricane just swept through it leaving the stores patched up with any kind of material they can find. The pharmacy on 5th avenue is a must. It has all your souvenirs and all the regulated drugs you can buy over the counter without a prescription. SUMMARY In traveling to other Iberostar resorts, we were disappointed in the Quetzal. It did have a nice layout and you did feel you were in a tropical environment with a great selection of pools and beaches. The Tucan is a mirror image of the Quetzal. We could not tell the difference. The food is below average for an Iberostar family of resorts. If you haven\u2019t been to other all inclusives and this is your first one, then I can guarantee that you can experience better food at other resorts. The STAR players made this trip a little uncomfortable and frustrating as mentioned above and I feel sorry for the few STAR players that really worked hard (Salvatore, Marisella, Michelle, Gaella and towel guy ) The other STAR players who thought it was all about them and their egos should consider an alternative job.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "lilcandi11", "Title": "\u201cFriendly Staff and Beautiful Resort!\u201d", "Author": "lilcandi11", "ReviewID": "UR27411017", "Content": "My 5 girlfriends and I were transferred to the Iberostar because our hotel was overbooked.

Check in time is normally 4:00pm, but our room was ready when we arrived, so we were able to head to our room right away! We stayed in building 27, in room 2726. It was a very nice room. Plenty big for the 2 of us and immaculately clean! Our balcony looked over the jungle...trees everywhere. The only downfall was that the birds were very loud in the morning. If you are a light sleeper, you should definately bring earplugs! Other than that, we have no complaints at all about the room. We headed to lunch at the buffet. The atmosphere is beautiful! Who wouldn't want to look at a beautiful waterfall while eating? The food was very good. We had no complaints at all about any of the food. I don't understand the complaints posted by others on this site. If you can't find enough good things to eat here, you definately have a problem! The ala carte restaurants were also very good. We ate at the Tropical, Japanese, and Mexican. They were all excellent! My finace' had Kabob Flambe' at the Mexican restaurant, and that was really a show!! Plus it tasted great! The beaches here are phenomenal!!! Beautiful sand and water! We literally spent almost the entire week laying on the beach! It was great! They have a dive shop on the left end of the beach at the resort. You can go on a local snorkeling trip right from there. It was $40/person U.S. and was totally worth it! You take a 10 minute boat ride right from the resort and snorkel at a coral reef. The fish, coral, water was all beautiful and the colors were amazing! I even got nose to nose with a sea turtle! It was awesome! We also went into Playa del Carmen shopping for an afternoon. If you walk out the front gate and turn right, you can walk right into the shopping district without having to cross a street or anything. It is a nice sidewalk and an easy 1/2 hour walk. If you prefer to take a cab, just ask the bellboy to call, and it's $5 U.S. The Star Friends provide all the entertainment and activities. They are amazing young people who work very hard to make sure everyone has a good time. We got a chance to sit and talk with a few of them and it was interesting to find out about their life at the resort. Overall, we have absolutely no complaints about anything at this resort.

There are plenty of other activities that the Star Friends organize for all ages (those guys and gals work hard all day and night and do an incredible job). We took a cab to the Mayan ruins in Tulum about 40 miles south of the resort which took a solid half-day.

We saw the reports about hard beds but we actually preferred them. If you're looking for plush soft bedding you may be disappointed. The beach was clean, the sand was white and soft, the water beautiful. Yes they have the 'sand whales' in place to prevent further erosion but they didn't detract from the overall beauty. We loved watching the pelicans dive-bomb into the surf coming out with fish. I recommend taking a walk south to the untouched beach as many others do; it's great. The buffets had so many choices that I spent the entire week without having the same item more than once.

As you do, watch you step, the paths throught the jungle are not real level. - Staff is very freindly and the specialty resturants were great (Bonsai - Japanese, Italian - Gondola & LaMarimba - Steakhouse). - Main Pool was very nice with refreshing water. Ongoing activities during the day - polo, water v-ball, arobics, etc. - Main Pool Bar was staffed by great bartenders - they worked very hard to meet everyones request. - Lobby bar was a place we all gathered every night before dinner.

Check in: We did not arrive until about 8:00 in the evening so we were the only one's checking in at the time so it was very smooth and fast. Rooms: We ended up having two rooms, the first room we were in was in block 26, Jungle view, it was an average room nothing special but everything worked good. I am the type of person who gets up very early (4:00am) sits on the belcony and has coffee, but with all the trees in front of our room it was very dark, so really not enjoyable. The nice thing about that room was it was nice and quiet. We looked around at different rooms from the outside, found the perfect location and asked when that room would be available and when it was we were able to switch. That room was 2146. It had a view of the ocean and partial pool. The grounds: They were gorgeous, yes the paths going through the resort were very uneven but they also had a smooth path running behind the rooms going from one end to the other so this really should not be a problem for anyone. Restaurants: It is true about the cold food in the buffet, I assume it is because it is so open, you put hot food on your plate but by the time you take it to your table it was cold. The Japenese was great tasting food, I don't eat sushi so I can not comment on that but my husband said he really liked it. Both my husband and I enjoyed the Steak House, very tender and had a nice taste to them. The Italian was also very good. Service: For the most part it was excellent, The only advice I have is do learn a few phrases you think you might need in spanish because I found the language barrier at this resort is huge. (My husband asked housekeeping if she was incharge of the beer, she replyed Si, so he gave her a tip of $20 and asked if she could bring up some more beer. She came up 10 minutes later with 2 packs of coffee. Well I had a great laugh. Also when you ask the front dest for anything you might have to ask 3 or 4 times but you will eventually get it. Also the housekeeping we had in the first room was wonderful, our room was spotless, the second room, not so much.

We booked the trip through our travel agent - we opted for the Iberostar Fun for Less package - which meant we waited until a few days before our trip to learn which hotel we received. We did a great deal of research before booking the Fun for Less package and realized that we really couldn't go wrong with any of the Iberostars in Playa. In this case the Quetzal is certainly the oldest of the Iberostars - but also one of the more popular. We met many families who were repeat visitors because of the family friendliness. Yes, the rooms were a little bit small (more of a conventional hotel room) but we spent very little time in the rooms. We stayed in building 21 which was ideal - right near the pool and the beach. The pool is very nicely maintained and the beach is endless sand. We had read somewhere that we were a short walk to downtown Playa del Carmen - so we ventured our one day via the beach route only to find that it was a long haul with two kids on a hot day - in addition, there are many hotels and homes that have no beach and it makes for a difficult walk - so I would suggest spending $5 for the cab ride. The food was ok, nothing spectacular - but good. We were able to get 4 reservations at the ala carte restaurants. We ate at Italian(our least favorite), Mexican (our favorite), Japanese, and Steak house - they were all good. The buffets were also good, something for everyone to eat. Although the buffets were not top of the line, there were some nice things that kept our family happy (like freshly baked pastries and breakfast). Our vacation revolved around food and drinks. The kids club was phenomenal - Michelle is fantastic. Our son begged us to play at the Kids club everyday. We ventured out on two snorkeling tours - both arranged through the dive shop at our hotel. The first was just a local one - about 10 mins by boat from the hotel - a great way to get the kids familiar with snorkeling. The second was a full day snorkeling in Cozumel - which was phenomenal - our kids were so excited to see Sea Turtles, Sting Rays and countless fish.

We saw a few monkeys, lots and lots of the little bunny rats (sorry, have forgotten the name) that were everywhere annoying the peacocks by getting in between the males and the females. The poor males were very busy chasing the little things away. The peacocks roosted on the balconies every day and, while they are not \"tame\", they don't run away when they see a person so there are numerous opportunities for photos. The flamingos were simply stunning, and we loved the swans. All in all, the wildlife is wonderful. It was a little noisy sometimes but the experience of having peacocks in your \"front yard\" certainly outweighs the inconvenience of a few yowls from the jungle! The room was nothing special, but it was certainly clean. It is true that there is no conditioner provided and if you want conditioner, bring your own. The hair dryer did work, but not like the one from home, so if you have really thick hair that takes a long time to dry at home, you might want to bring your own hair dryer. We went into Playa a few times ($5 for a cab). It's really \"touristy\" and if you like bargaining with all the vendors this is your place. We did find that it was as cheap or cheaper to buy silver, clothes, etc from the gift shop in the hotel as to bargain for half an hour in Playa. The selection is much less but the prices are fine. It just depends on what you like. The buffet was very good and there was a LOT of variety. I can't figure out why people are saying that there is no fresh fruit or vegetables. The pastries are to die for! If you can't find something to eat there, you must be pretty darn picky! The service was great - the waiters are very observant, dirty dishes are removed immediately, and a glass or cup is filled right away. The Japanese restaurant was great, the Mexican restaurant was great too. The steakhouse gave us so much steak we couldn't finish it. The tropical restaurant was sort of un-memorable. In fact, I can't remember what we had there. Some other visitors told us that the Italian restaurant was not so good. We didn't go there so I can't say for sure. There were always lounge chairs available, all day long. So I don't know what the complaints are about. Not every one had shade, (but most did), so maybe that is the complaint. We did not personally see anyone \"holding\" a lounge chair by putting a towel on it. The hotel made it pretty clear that if you went off and left your towels on the lounges and it was evident that no one was really there, your towels would disappear and you would be paying a fee to get new ones. The ice cream served by the pool was a fun thing! There seems to be food and drink everywhere, all day and night! The beach was white sand, and very clean. There is a little bit of topless sunbathing so if that bothers you, you might want to scope out your location before settling in for the day! The shows at night were good. I don't know how the Star Friends do it! Don't they ever sleep? These are not Las Vegas shows, but they are entertaining, fun and the price is right (FREE!). We liked the Quetzal a lot and if we were coming back to Playa, would certainly stay here again.", "Date": "February 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cFriends got married at the Iberostar\u201d", "Author": "i2smile", "ReviewID": "UR24418893", "Content": "We had a group of 12 people stay at the Iberostar Quetzal in the beginning of December.

Other visitors told us that it had been cool and rainy the week before, but we lucked out. Unlike neighboring hotels, the Iberostar feels like Mexico--it is built in a patch of jungle complete with wild monkeys and other wildlife. Hotels nearby are gleaming white and full of crystal chandeliers while the Iberostar is colorful Mexican stucco with big porches on each room and a spectacular beach. The rooms are immaculately clean and the staff friendly and fun. Cobble-stone paths link the various buildings, paving the way through the jungle. It is an all-inclusive resort. The food is good, fresh, and presented well. There are four reservations-only restaurants that you have the ability to go to depending on how long your stay is. We ate one night at the Japanese restaurant and thoroughly enjoyed it. A couple of wishes--a heated hot tub and heated swim-up bar. The \"hot\" tub and swim-up bar are beautiful, but too cold to enjoy. The pool is huge and beautiful, but only refreshingly cool. The nightly \"entertainment\" is campy, but you don't go to a place like this for Las Vegas-style shows. Go sit on the beach at night and enjoy the stars. The location is near Xcaret and not far from Xel-Ha. We visited Xcaret and had a wonderful time. One word of advice: The brochures say it is open until 10 p.m., but in fact it mostly closes at 5:30 p.m. so all of the staff can participate in the two-hour cultural show that starts at 6 p.m. So after 5:30 p.m. you can't do much else in the park, so plan your day accordingly.

This is the third Riviera Maya resort in which we've stayed, and Iberostar Quetzal is the one we're most likely to return to (even though we had a couple concerns.) It is a quiet, beautiful resort that is excellent for families or couples. The main draw is the grounds, which feel like a jungle, The natural area may actually be no bigger than a football field, but it feels larger due to winding (and purposely uneven) paths and very dense foliage. While strolling through the interior of the resort, you may see monkeys, peacocks, and other wildlife. The common areas are also beautiful and fit the more natural theme of the resort. The lobby is not enclosed and combines luxury (marble, dramatic lighting, fine decor) with nature (soaring thatched roof, pools, and foliage). The fine restaurants are beautifully designed, and the buffet areas are clean and comfortable. Walking to one of the buffets, you pass by a bird sanctuary with flamingos and walk over a bridge with a view of a waterfall tumbling into a glen with ducks and swans. The setting really is terrific. The quibbles: The room was clean but small (by the standards of other resorts in which I've stayed). It also had some delayed maintenance--a knob on a door pulled off in my hand and the closet doors swung wildly since guides were missing on the floor. During our stay, two of the three light bulbs in our bathroom expired, but they were never replaced. Another quibble was with the food. The dining in the nicer, reservations restaurants is excellent (especially the Japanese restaurant, although the Mexican restaurant and steakehouse were also very tasty). The buffets were good but not terrific--some items were excellent, but a lot was only okay. Back to praise: The service was excellent! The front desk staff was cheerful and helpful, the bar staff was attentive, the waitstaff was responsive and friendly, and you couldn't pass an employee on the path without hearing a \"Hola!\" The location of the Quetzal is nice for those wanting to visit 5th Avenue in Playa del Carmen. It is part of the Playacar zone, which is adjacent to downtown Playa. The Quetzal is one of the furthest resorts in Playacar, but it's only a two-mile walk or a $5 taxi ride into town. Because of it's location, you may wish to consider a private transfer from the airport to the hotel--Playa del Carmen is almost an hour away from the Cancun airport, and if you take a public transfer (bus) to the Quetzal you can expect to make a few stops before getting to your resort. If you want a contemporary hotel or a party resort, look elsewhere.

Not true, both have equal beach front. TRANSPORTATION from airport took FOREVER...made at least four stops. The airport is only 45 miles away, but it took TWO hours to arrive at the Iberostar (not so fun with a five month old). Our Arrival: Ground floor, small hotel room-nothing exciting, definitely does not compare to US five star standards. Our patio door would not lock and the room had an unpleasant smell, so we asked to be moved. The front desk said no, and that they had nothing else. We asked for a manager and of course, after we insisted that we be moved the manager \"found\" a room for us. DISAPPOINTED with front desk service upon check in. No one to greet us, had to wait for bell boy. The hotel is situated in a \"plush\" jungle setting. We loved that...will need bug spray. We were harassed by mosquitos a bit. FOOD: Ha, it was just like the reviews. NOTHING exciting. The Japanese was nice, but all the others were pretty uninspiring! Sorry to see the buffet had very little fresh fruit/veggies and the fish/seafood was not fresh at all. TENNIS COURTS were not very well maintained, however the pro was great! FITNESS CENTER had a nice variety of aerobic machines and weights, but the water dispenser was pretty dirty looking. BEACH was the best one in the \"hotel\" zone of Playa, thank goodness, otherwise we would have felt we wasted our time and money!

It can be confusing coming back from the pool and finding the reception on the wrong side. The Tucan has marble floors from the entertainment area to reception while the Quetzal has wood flooring. Everything has been said about the Hotel and I agree with almost all of them. We stayed from 28th December until 11th Jan 2009 and we really enjoyed our stay. My wife and I and and 2 children 11, and 14. Tips. Be careful on the big sand bags as they are slippery and there has been several injuries. I was told a elderly Lady fell and hit her head and she will now be disabled. This happened while we were there. All the hotels have these beach whales so just be careful. The alcohol seems weaker but you can have Jack Daniels, Smirnoff, Torres brandy and Gordons Gin all at no extra charge. We even got free champagne. You have just got to ask for it, it helps if you tip a couple of US dollars too. For UK visitors change your money in Mexico as you get a better rate the Hotel is not too bad. I got 20.4 pesos to the pound then 19.4 and in the end 18.4 in the space of 10 days. So rates change quickly. The airport charge also went from 53 US dollars to 56 US dollars during our stay this has to be paid in cash. We travelled with Thomas Coke and they are strict with the weight limit. We paid \u00a320 each for an extra 5kgs to total 20kgs on booking but we were 5 kgs over limit at Cancum and we had to pay 20 US dollars per kg. So in 5 minutes checking in it cost 324 US dollars or over \u00a3200. Us dollars are accepted most places but the rate differs. An $ with one line through is Pesos and with 2 lines through is US dollars. Cancun airport is very expensive, you can get Domino's pizza, burgers, japanese and Mexican food in the departure area, but it 's expensive. 28 US dollars for a 12 \" pizza and 2 drinks. A bottle of water $44 or over 2 pounds. A 500g bag of jelly beans was $550 or just under \u00a330, a bag of crisps were over 1 pound.

The beach was beautiful, the food was good, the service was excellent. My complaints probably aren't specific to the IB Quetzal- I suspect that most all-inclusives just aren't what I'm looking for in a vacation experience. Room- the room was clean and comfortable, and the air-conditioning worked well. The room had 2 double beds and a daybed, which was perfect for my family of 4 since the kids don't like sharing a bed. The room was cleaned well, and the mini-bar was well stocked with beer, pop, and water. Beach- the beach was beautiful with soft sand, blue-green water. I'm used to the Pacific, so even with red flag days and the sandbag whales, I thought the water was wonderfully warm and calm, and the sandbags were fun to play on and created sheltered spots to play in the water when the waves were rough. Grounds- the jungle surroundings were well kept and nicely landscaped. Pretty lights and trellises everywhere. Seeing so much wildlife was very cool. Food- we never bothered to book in the restaurants, but the buffets were very good. The food was good quality and freshly made. It didn't have the feeling of typical steam table food sitting under heat lamps all night. There was good variety in our 4 night stay. Drinks- were fine everywhere, but were best at the lobby bar and the bar where the shows are held. We noticed that our first drinks were usually made from the rum on the counter, but after we tipped, all our drinks after (if it was the same bartender) were Bacardi even though we never asked for it. We didn't really care all that much, but it was interesting to see it happen several different times. In the bars that had it available, they were happy to pour me Bombay gin if I asked for it by name, even before they saw I was tipping. Service- was uniformly excellent. People were very friendly and helpful, and seemed genuinely pleased -and patient!- when we used our poor Spanish skills. Shows- the main evening shows were very good- live band, dancing and singing. The 'kids show' at the earlier time slot is only worth it if you have young children who want to go onto the stage and participate in the games and dances. We mistakenly thought it would be a toned down version of the main show later, when it was instead an hour of watching a dozen kids playing musical chairs or quiz shows. Fine if that's what you're looking for, but our kids weren't into it. Why I probably wouldn't go back- it was all simply too big and too crowded for it to be really relaxing for me. Again, this isn't necessarily the fault of the IB Quetzal- I realise that to make an all-inclusive work you have to pack a lot of people in. On the plus side- we never had to wait in line-ups for food or drink, but on the negative, the chair saving thing was a big drawback. In any other beach hotel we've stayed at (including one other all-inclusive in Puerto Vallarta) you could wander back and forth all day between the beach, the pool, your room, and while you might not get your first pick of spots, you could always find somewhere to sit. There were several times at the Quetzal where we literally could not find anywhere to sit down except inside the restaurants or in our rooms. We weren't being picky about sun or shade or proximity to water- we just wanted any place for 4 people to sit down and kick back and we couldn't find a spot anywhere. And this was the first week of December, usually very slow season in the area. No, it didn't ruin my vacation - we still had a great time- but I probably wouldn't do another mid-range all inclusive again because of it. I'd rather stay in a cheaper place and be able to wake up when I want and come and go to the beach as I please and then spend the price differential on food and drink of my choosing. Or do fewer days and splurge on a more expensive place with a better amenities to population ratio.

Generally, it was a very good vacation. Things we loved: 1) The Beach: They have done a great job restoring the beach at the IB Quetzal. The Tucan side still needs a bit of work - even with the \"whales,\" there was visible erosion while we were there during high tide, but I have to applaud the efforts. The \"whales\" (e.g., the sand bags used to help stop the erosion) are not a problem at all and it was delightful fun to watch the kids playing on them. They also create nice little \"pools\" in front of them for smaller kids and parents to use. 2) The Water Sports: We took out at catamaran everyday (and it was free!). Hubby and I really enjoyed the ability to sail on our own each day and it was a highlight to the vacation. (You can also snorkel and take out kayaks for free). This was one of the best parts of our room location being on the Quetzal side -- we were right by the catamarans and we might not have known about them if we'd been further down the beach. 3) The Bars: All-in-all, not too bad. The wine sucked (but I'm a foodie and an oenophile, so I'm very picky). I drank a lot of Kir Royals and mojitos and that seemed to work well enough for me. The bartenders at the Quetzal lobby bar and the waitstaff there were fantastic -- we spent a lot of evenings there, hanging out with people we met, or playing cards/backgammon. 4) The Room: Very typical AI room, but a smidge bigger than what I recall from other resorts. We had a king-sized bed and the girls room had two doubles -- and they weren't terribly hard. I did see staff hauling around \"eggcrate\" pads, so you can get them if you need. Shower was great, balcony was great. Nothing to complain about here... and really, who is in the room that often? 5) The Grounds: Very nice! I loved looking for the wildlife - especially the monkeys. The inner passages to the restaurants, theatre, etc are indeed very difficult to navigate even in flats (very bumpy and with some natural holes in the the rocks). But they are fine for daytime passage and even okay if you have someone to hang onto at night! We went out at night to the beach as well -- champagne at the stroke of midnight on New Year's eve was more our style than the loud disco. 6) Food: Incredibly, INCREDIBLY disappointing. I've stayed at other AIs so I know what other food is like and frankly, Iberostar just missed the mark. Food was lukewarm, not a lot of variety and even the specialty restaurants were disappointing. We did go into town a few times for dinners -- a much better choice (with Alux being our favorite place, even though the food there was a bit over-cooked and over-salted too). And really, I knew that the food wouldn't be gourmet, but really, it was barely passable. Overall, a lovely resort with a lovely, friendly staff. We met very nice people here and our daughters (18 and 20) really enjoyed the disco and meeting other young adults. (One word of caution: for some ridiculous reason, they turn off the phones after midnight. We, fortunately, brought a set of walkie-talkies with us and we could communicate that way when the phones were shut off.) Would we go back? Probably not... there are many more resorts to explore and I think we are growing past the 'cruise ship\" mentality of the AIs.

One plus is that there is a coffee maker in the room. The mini fridge is also a plus which contains sodas, water a few beers. There is only a shower, no tub. They do provide shampoo and a body wash.

These are to put your cups in. As long as people notice them it helps to keep the place clean. Buffets are the norm. They have a wide variety and a pretty good selection. They are also large enough to not feel too crowded. There are two main ones split by the theater. If you've ever stayed at a large resort with a small buffet diner, you'll be pleasantly pleased with the Ibero. It is sufficient. For breakfast and lunch you have the option to eat out near the pool or the buffet. For dinner it's the buffet or the ala cartes. I stayed only 4 nites this visit. I was able to eat at two ala cartes, plus they offered me to make more reservations. I had other plans so two was all I could do. I again ate at the Mexican. It was delicous! I had the arrechera, tortilla soup and some appetizers. Can't go wrong with this. It was great. I also had the Japenese the other night. As usual it was very entertaining. The chicken and shrimp were delicous. This time I stayed for dessert. What a wise decision that was. Tempura fried bananas with a scoop of ice cream drizzled with chocolate syrup. Oh, My, Gosh.. That was good. I didn't do any pool time this visit. Yet it was there and oh, so inviting. Happened upon the pool bar again. That place is so fun. Good bartenders, monkeys up in the trees, no kids in the pool (mind you, this pool is a bit on the cool side). The beach is great. Not as big as it was, but still great. Yes, they have the sand whales. People make use of them. Get to the beach early. It fills up quick, especially if you would like a palapa. If you don't get a palapa, make sure you get your lounger, then go up to the towel hut to rent your sun-umbrella. I had an ocean front room, so the one day I was able to beach it, I got out there and plopped my butt down under a palapa. Mind you I was kind enough to share it with another couple who needed some shade too. (It's not mine and everyone has equal privilages, without sitting on one another. haha). The service is fantastic. The frront desk employees always had a smile. Everyone always said Hola/Hello. Almost forgot. Besides the evening shows in the very nice theater. There's also the disco which opens some time about 10 or after. Don't know how long it stays open. That's towards the front of the resort on the Quetzal side. With it all the way up there it's not heard. Then sometime after midnight or so, the main buffet on the Quetal side is open (not fully) and has some late night snacks. For those of you that stay out a bit late and still want something (???), stop in here. Nothing gourmet, that's for sure. There is room service that has limited menu and times. There is also beach service which is fantastic. I'm just getting spoiled by these extra little plus'. Sitting on a lounger just day-dreaming on the quiet side. Listening to the surf and gazing at the beautiful blue -- along comes a nice person and asks if I'd like something. Hey?? What wold befit this picture?? How about a pina colada?? Great. Ok ~ enough day dreaming. Yes. I would go back to the Iberstar Quetzal/Tucan. I'm looking forward to visiting the Ibero Paraiso complex sometime soon.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "windsor, ontario, canada", "Title": "\u201cwonderful vacation\u201d", "Author": "michael c", "ReviewID": "UR23061727", "Content": "We stayed at the Quetzal from Dec. 14-21 with our 11 year old son. We had a great time. The hotel rooms were nicely appointed with a large shower and excellent water pressure. You should email the resort a few days before leaving and request a room as close to the beach as possible and on the third level. This will provide you with a partial view of the beach and allows you to see the monkeys from a birds eye view. Regarding the monkeys, they are elusive and you need to seek them out. Don't arrive at the resort thinking that the monkeys are running rampant . They are there, but you need to find them. One tip.....you will hear a sound that you would swear is a wild boar howling. That is the sound that the monkeys make! Don't be alarmed. Follow that sound and it will take you right to the action. Feed them at your own risk. They are really cool. The rest of the wild life is abundant (most of the time the peacocks are blocking your way on the paths). None of the animals will bother with you unless you offer food. Just remember what you are getting yourself into. The food is way above average. As buffets go, excellent spread. Don't worry about prior reviews that rated the food poorly. Its really good. Fresh, plentiful, and great selection. If you choose the a la carte route, remember to book as soon as you arrive. We did the Caribbean (get the red snapper.....very nice), and the steak house (forget the fillet, go for the ribeye as it was so tender and splendidly spiced, it was truly in my top 5 best steaks ever....no joke, it's that good). Have a great time and remember these few tips........1/ play the game and get up early to claim your sun lounger (before 6:30 am for pool side and 8 am for the beach unless you want shade, than before 6:30 am as well). You can get a folding shade umbrella from the beach towel hut for free prior to 9am. Trade in your towels for fresh ones every evening instead of waiting till morning. 2/ bring inflatable beach tubes from home or pay quadruple for them at the resort. 3/ Upon arriving in Cancun, try to avoid the large bus in favour of a small one to deliver you to your resort.....it will save you an hour minimum. 4/ This resort is not a friendly one for women wearing heels.....very uneven paths. Enjoy the resort, we had a blast! We met great people and everyone was friendly.

We booked this vacation 6 months ahead, so I had plenty of time to read the good and the bad. We booked this vacation with our grown children. We are in our 60's, they are in their 40's. We booked with FunJet, and I'd like to say we were pleased with that service. Reasonable, informative, with no problems from start to finish. My daughter and I own our own business and never had the opportunity to vacation together, so this was our first trip together and we could not have been happier. Our flight was fine for a 6 hour flight. We were excited to start our vacation. We arrived at the resort about 6:00 pm. We were thirsty and tired. We were greeted with a cold drink, and very nice people to check us in. That took about 15 minutes. We were surprised to find out our room was 2229. Right by the pool and steps away from the beach. Too good to be true! It was my daughters birthday on Friday the 12th, so we booked our dinner right away in the Japanese Resturant @ 7:00 pm. No problem. Tuesday night we picked \"The Tropical\", and Thursday \"The Steak House.\" Our bags were taken to our room, and we stayed in the lobby to have a drink and rest for a few. Drinks were wonderful, and very refreshing. So much for the complaints on the drinks. I never had a bad drink. Miami Vice, wonderful. Crazy Frog, wonderful. Bloody Mary, wonderful. Champagne, wonderful. You name it we had it, all wonderful. ROOM: Wow!!! We only booked one room to save money. I would not do that again, but we managed. The room was beautiful. Beds a bit firm, but not all that bad as mentioned in other reviews. Air conditioning worked fine, in fact too good at times. Shower was wonderful and large. Door to the bathroom hit the toilet and that was kind of irritating, but give me a break. Deal with it. Terrace was wonderful, and the only noise was in the am when all the criters woke up. I loved it. I'm an early bird anyway. If your really tired it won't bother you one way or the other. The only reason I would book my own room is that with two women, and 6 suitcases, there just isn't enough room. We managed but would do it different next time. Bottom line, how many hours would you spend in your room anyway? Not much! Beach & Pools: Swim up pool was fabulous. Good drinks, nice people, great bartenders. Main pool was fine also. My son-in-law always got up early to save lounges. Yep, even though the rules say not to save, we were told you have to save if you want a place to sit by the pool or on the beach. He just laughed when I said their rules say \"not to save.\" He said \"save!\" We did. No problem if you get up prior to 5 am. It's just the way it is, so you go with it. We only had a couple of days of sunshine. Mostly it was cloudy, but still warm. The ocean felt warmer than the pools to me, but both were fine. It was never crowded in the pools or on the beach. We saved chairs on the beach once. We left those as there are little sand fleas that bite, and after awhile, they drove me nuts. So back to the pools. The sand was wonderful to walk in, and it was nice to be able to rinse off your feet at the showers on the beach. Also, beach bar was great. Again, good drinks. If you want more booze in your drink, just ask. We tipped them regularly, because they deserved it, not to get a better drink. Very nice, and always ready to please. Guess I also have to mention the topless women, and big bellied men who wear thongs. I love to people watch, so it didn't bother me. However, some of you need to know that almost anything goes. Some people, I won't mention who, seem very rude. However, I've been told by a good friend (from that part of the world) that they have no clue about lines, and waiting their turn. Guess I need to sit down with her and have a long chat. I just learned how to bully my way when needed. Again, no big deal. I wasn't going to let anyone spoil the good times. I thought it was an experience to see how other cultures act. I did a lot of people watching. One more thing, the kids were fine. Only a couple of brats, and there is plenty of room to get away. One time when we were sitting pool side a couple with 1/2 grown brats decided to let them dive right in front of us. Dirty looks, and complaining didn't help, so we moved. There were all kinds of places to dive, but these parents could give a rat. Some people and their brats. Still, I didn't let it get to me. I just moved, and let it go. For the most part the children were fun to watch. Food: You know all the resturants if you have read reviews. Here is my take on the food: You will find something you like where ever you choose to eat. Also, you can eat at the specialty resturants every night if you don't care how late you eat. The buffet was wonderful too. If you don't like something then all you have to do it set it aside and find something you do like. If you can't find something you like, I suggest you stay home, and never venture out. I loved the Tropical. Acutally, I loved all of them. As I look back at the other reviews, I just shake my head. I agree with others who say that some people just like to complain. Entertainment: Night life is not at the resort. If you want to dance, and party, then go to 5th. The shows are late in the evening but fun to watch. Some are excellent, others are so, so. I didn't go on vacation to stay up until 3:00 am so no big deal to me. So if you are going to this resort to party, dance, and see shows, you may not be satisfied. It's about the only thing I have to say that is negative. I was fine with what they offered, but after going on a cruise ship last May, there is no comparison. The cruise ship had all kinds of night life, and it started early. Karoke, and many different dance clubs. Country, Jazz, modern, you name it the cruise offered it. 5th offers anything, and everything from the Blue Parrot, to Sr Frogs. However, it costs. We had lunch at Sr Frogs, and it was $75 for 4 people. Food was good, but I thought that was a lot for lunch. Shopping: Lots of nice shops right at the resort. Sometimes they were cheaper than downtown. Also, they have a nice shopping center just down the road from the resort, or you can pay $5 and go to 5th. I was surprised at how large an area 5th covers. I thought it was one street. NOT!!! It's an entire town. We went three times, and we never saw the whole thing. Wear tennis shoes, as your feet will kill you. Walkways are very uneven and it's hard to walk without tennis shoes. It's a \"gotta do it\" kind of thing. Don't miss 5th. Grounds and Lay Out: It took us awhile to figure out where to find stuff, but it was a great adventure. The grounds are so beautiful, and the jungle walks are also something to do everyday, as you never know what your going to see. I loved the resort for that reason. You can stay at a brand new resort anywhere, anytime. This resort really gives you the feeling of Mexico. A few bad smells once in awhile, but there wasn't anywhere we went that we didn't smell sewage here and there. Oh yeah, don't go barefoot. My husband and I took a big fall right after we started into our building going to our room. We were both barefoot and we hit the tile, and down we went. Be careful of the wet stones. It's best to wear flip flops or shoes no matter where you go. Also, the walkways are very uneven. Be sure to pick up your feet. It's so easy to trip on the stones. Just the way it is. Pick your feet up and you will not have a problem. Also pay attention to the lighted steps. I didn't and took another good fall as I didn't see the step. Tri-focals you know!!! LOL Dress: One of the things I wondered about was dress code. No one was real clear on that so here it is: My husband wore Dockers and a Hawian shirt, dress shoes. I wore summer dresses, slip on shoes, or heels. Most of the days I wore my bathing suit. Shorts, or short skirt and tennis shoes when we went to 5th. Even when the sun is not out it's warm. A sweater maybe. I only needed a light sweater once in the evening when at the show. The wind came up and it was chilly. I am from North ID, so it felt really warm to me most of the time. Everywhere else, wear what you want. Shorts, flip flops, etc. Overall Opinion: Two complaints. Not enough sun, and would not share a room. Everything else was just wonderful. Beautiful people, plenty to do, plenty to eat, and plenty to drink. I'm already planning another trip with family. This resort is not new, but very homey, with lots of character. I can't imagine anyone not having a wonderful time. I will go again, and I will tell others to go. Can't wait to plan the next trip!!!!! Next time I will probably plan some out of resort trips. This time I just relaxed at the resort and the beach. You will have a blast!!!!! I will try to post pictures at a later date.

I want to make something very clear \u2013 Tucan and Quetzal are EXACTLEY the same resort. This threw me off when I was looking at people\u2019s reviews, since Tucan\u2019s are better. They are the same property and have identical rooms, amenities and grounds. This is a really great value for the money. We booked a month in a half in advance, and got a great deal. Check around on pricing because we ended up going through an agent and got a better deal with direct flights. Make an attempt to speak Spanish, they really do appreciate it! Bring a large insulated mug for drinks, bug spray, plenty of sunscreen lotion and something warmer, since one night it was VERY cold and people wore jackets. By 7am, almost all the spots on the beach were taken! We got up at 6:30am to put down our towels (which you should exchange before you leave the beach/pool every day and keep overnight to save your spot the next morning). If we did not get a spot with a palapa, they had umbrellas you could sign out at the towel hut with the towels, which opened every day at 8am. We downloaded a bunch of movies on our laptop, and watched them in the evenings, and this was a great idea. They have internet service available in the lobby and I believe its about $10 per day. I have T-mobile and my phone had no service. My boyfriend has US Cellular, and his phone worked the whole time. You do not need to exchange money! Every place you go takes dollars or Euro. If you do want to exchange, the best rate we saw was 1 dollar = 13 pesos at the airport. Off course this changes depending on the economy. We tipped maid service every day and the servers as well. They were very grateful and it was a small addition for the great service we received. Prices at the airport for food are very high ($13 dollars for a burger, fries and medium drink, $9 dollars for a slice of pizza). When you are leaving from the resort, they bring you to the airport about 2 hours before your flight, so I suggest you take some food from the resort with you to avoid the high prices. *********************************************************************** My boyfriend and I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Quetzal and we both had a good time. I have been in Mexico before as well as the Dominican and have stayed at all inclusives. I am one of those people that does thorough research before going/staying somewhere and based on on a good deal of research (which my boyfriend was sick of) and reading people\u2019s reviews, Tucan rated very high within the price range we wanted to spend on this trip. Even though we don\u2019t have kids, we didn\u2019t mind going to a family resort. At this time (right before the holidays) there were not that many kids, so we were not annoyed by screaming babies\u2026more so by loud rowdy adults if anything! ARRIVAL AT AIRPORT: Make sure you know which company you booked with since there are a lot of people selling trips and timeshares that will bombard you and tell you they are there to just help you and provide you with information. They are lying and just want you to sign up. Walk straight through to the outside and just tell them all no thank you. Outside the drivers and hotel/agency representatives hold up signs, like Apple Vacations, Lomas travel/Fun Jet, etc. so just look for your contact and they will have your name based on your resort. The ride there, depending on where you are staying, ranges from 30 minutes up to 2 hours. Since people in the van are staying at different resorts, you are dropped off from closest to furthest. We were second to last, so it took us a while. The weather was nice and we just looked out the window. You can buy cold corona in the van, 2 for $5.00. Fyi - the trip back to the airport only took 45 minutes because we were the only ones in the van. CHECK-IN AT QUETZAL The foyer/entrance area is beautiful. Marble floors, thatched roof, water fountains, it was very nice and peaceful. As mentioned in other reviews our room was not ready, but we didn\u2019t care, since we were hungry and ready for some sunshine. We received a drink upon arrival and than went to find some place to eat. THE ROOM Our room was ready in one hour and we were in building 26, which we really liked. Our balcony faced the back, and at first I was disappointed that I didn\u2019t have a jungle view, but we were only in our rooms to sleep, so it never bothered us at all. I read in other reviews that if you e-mailed the resort in advance they would try and comply with your request for certain rooms/buildings. We thought the location was very convenient and didn\u2019t mind the few minutes walk to the beach and pool. FYI - there are not many rooms with an ocean view, and most are given to honeymooners. The inside of the room was as expected and just like the pictures. It was clean and d\u00e9cor was very 90\u2019s. It was completely fine and had everything we needed. The outlets were American, so we didn\u2019t need converters, the TV had channels in both English and Spanish, and the mini bar was stocked with beer, Sprite, Coke, Fanta and water. I\u2019m sure you can make special requests, but we were fine with what we had. The fridge is restocked every 2 days. THE GROUNDS The resort grounds are really great! They have a jungle setting with monkeys, turtles, peacocks, ducks, flamingos, swans, and other birds, turtles and little fuzzy animals that kind of look like beavers/rats/squirrels (without the tails). We are both huge animal lovers and didn\u2019t feel that any of the animals were abused or unhappy in any way. The setting there is ideal for them and there is plenty of cover, water and food. Employees are always cleaning and trimming, so the grounds are very well maintained. THE BEACH It was surprisingly nice! I had read reviews about the \u201cwhales\u201d in the water which are there to help protect and allow for rebuilding of the beaches. People mentioned not having space to swim, however after walking along the beach, the resort has the best beach space! The sand was clean, and there were not many whales/sand bags blocking the swimming area. We were lucky that we only had chopy water one day and it wasn\u2019t too bad, and the rest of the days the water was calm, warm and a pleasure to swim in. FOOD Tucan and Quetzal are mirror images of each other. With one main buffet area on each side and a smaller eating areas on each side by the beach \u2013 all serve the same food. They also have four specialty restaurants, and based on the reviews we read, we ate at the Japanese and steak house at 8:30, which was a great time since the shows didn\u2019t start until 9pm, they did have a pre show every night that started around 8:30pm. They also had Italian and Mexican. Being from Chicago and living in the city, we have a ton of AMAZING restaurants, so we were not impressed by the food served at the 2 that we chose. They were both fine, but the steakhouse was definitely better\u2026The service in all the places was very good. We tipped every day. The breakfast buffet at the main restaurants was really great with tons of options. I had guacamole and salsa every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! The bartenders are accommodating and can take direction well if you want them to make something special that they have never made. We really liked the mojitos and always asked for the better alcohol. If you don\u2019t ask, you\u2019ll get the cheap stuff. I suggest bringing an insulated mug for a large morning coffee and a bigger drink. Their serving cups for beverages are fairly small. Having ice cream in the pool are right near the beach was great, and they had a variety of options every day. The coconut was really yummy! SERVICE As I mentioned everyone there is very nice and helpful, and they do appreciate efforts to speak Spanish. Mine is fairly good and they were really impressed, and seemed to try even harder to please us once I spoke with them in their native tongue. ENTERTAINMENT I think this is based on people\u2019s taste and experiences. One thing for sure is that they work hard and try to entertain. The evening shows were amateur, and we ended up leaving most of the time before they were finished. Some of the singers were good, others\u2026.well, should have kept to dancing/performing. I liked boogie nights, and my boyfriend liked the folk dancing, and we both liked karaoke. ACTIVITIES We just kayaked and snorkeled, which did not cost extra. They have windsurfing and scuba diving available for an extra charge. EXCURSIONS Based on reviews we did the Tulum Extreme/Mayan Extreme Adventure which lasted from 7:30 to 3:30. We went to the Mayan ruins at Tulun which were beautiful, and then into the jungle to repel, and zip line (almost 2,000 ft) and snorkel in a cave. Lunch was included, and we had a very good time. Bring your camera, because you can take pictures. The do have someone there taking pictures of you, and will offer you a CD with the pics for $25. We went through our travel rep and I know we could have received a better deal if we went directly through the company. We paid $96 per person plus tips. If you have a bigger group, you should get a good deal based on numbers. Again, check prices with other sales reps and even on 5th avenue. The rep makes commission, so they won\u2019t always be the most honest. Isla Mujeres is supposed to be wonderful, but we ran out of time. This is a great beach destination and has received great reviews from my friends that have been there. We walked to 5th avenue, and it was about 30-40 minutes from the resort (walk) or $5 via taxi. Very touristy and tons of souvenirs and restaurants, including Starbucks and Burger King. Prices went up a lot on food and souvenirs both, and the stores won\u2019t budge on the prices of souvenirs. NEVER pay what is asked at the smaller individually owned stands, and quantity always allows for better deals.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, Scotland", "Title": "\u201cWedding dreams came true!\u201d", "Author": "jmcummings8", "ReviewID": "UR22670017", "Content": "After my husband and I decided to get married in the Caribbean, there were hundreds of places to choose from. My sister-n-law recommended the Tucan/Quetzal as she had been before and after reading so many great reviews, we took the plunge and booked our wedding date for the 13th November 2008. And I am so happy we did! We liked it right at check-in. Such a beautiful place in a beautiful jungle, with a beach to die for. The reception pavilion looks a bit lower key then some of the the majestic places you pass on the way but I liked it better. It looked much more authentic and lush. Our check in experience was quick. We received our welcome drinks and then we were driven by golf cart to our room with our luggage which was handy. We went for 8 nights and were joined throughout the week by 32 friends and family. My husband and I travelled from the U.K. but since he is Irish and I am American, all of our guests came from either the U.S., Ireland or the U.K. Everybody loved the place and many of them complimented the choice of resort. I had requested that all of our 32 guests be placed within the first 3 blocks on either side of the resort closest to the beach. Well I was amazed when they told me that everyone from our party was going to be in block 22. Wow! My mom had a partial ocean view (she was on the top floor facing outward) and other people had monkeys and iguanas come to their balconies (rooms facing inward). I was disappointed though that they wouldn't upgrade me and my husband to the ocean suites for free. Mayra said our travel agent would have needed to do this as all rooms are pre-booked to agents. But my agent (Thomas Cooke) didn't have an option for the ocean suites. I think the hotel could have added this as a courtesy since we were bringing 32 people to the resort and having a wedding there which is a substantial amount of money for them to make plus they did have availability. We could have paid an extra $500 for this but thought this was too steep. It turned out nice though as I loved being across the hall from my matron of honour and downstairs from another briedsmaid. Plus we both don't see our families too much so it was convenient to have everyone right there. Getting up and going to breakfast was always nice, especially since we would always see someone from our party at the buffet, not to mention the monkeys, birds, rat-like things and lizards on the way. The Quetzal and Tucan are both open for breakfast, lunch and dinner and they are the exact same. For dinner, we ate at the Mexican, Italian, Japanese and Steak House for the wedding. All of it was good but the Japanese was so entertaining. I think the food there was my favorite. I was in a whirlwind for my wedding so I hardly remember eating the food in the steak house. Other people said it was really good though. The buffets were also very good for all meals and I can\u2019t fault it at all. So much variety and all of it tasted good. I ate lunch everyday at the bar at the beach. It was pretty much tortilla chips (homemade ones!) with salsa and guac for me the whole time although you have a pretty big selection there as well. I did have chicken cordon bleu there once which was delicious. The salsa is the BEST I\u2019ve ever had. Mmmm! Every night after dinner, everyone would meet at the Quetzel lobby for drinks which was great. The Tucan lobby seemed to be quite crowded every night which had a good atmosphere. But since there were so many people in my party, it was convenient to go to the Quetzal where we could all pull enough seats in a big oblong circle. I apologize to anyone else there that week that maybe thought we took over the bar but it never seemed to be a problem. At the beginning of the week, I was convinced the drinks in the lobby seemed really weak but I think after my husband gave them a couple hefty tips for the night, they recognized our party and poured it on. The Margaritas taste exactly how you think they should. So good and so refreshing! We also went to the nightclub the night of my wedding. We had the option to rent it out privately from the 8-10 time slot but we were happy to take our time at the meal and then have drinks in the lobby bar after the meal. At midnight, we all went to the disco and we practically had the place to ourselves anyway. The DJ played the few songs I requested and we all had a great time. For a resort disco, I think it\u2019s fine. The music speakers seem pretty good quality anyway. Everyday a bunch of us gathered on the beach and although it was sometimes hard to find chairs with umbrellas, there were always plenty of chairs. It worked out because most people wanted to be in the sun anyway. The pool was more difficult to actually find chairs in the sun as most of those were taken first. I'm a beach person though and with the sea being so beautiful, I didn't mind. The sand there is heavenly as well. I had decided to go barefoot for my wedding before I even got to the resort so I was so happy to find that the sand is that big, soft, plush, squidjy sand that runs through your toes. Just what I had dreamed of. The big lumps in the water did get in the way a bit for our wedding pictures but overall I don't think it mattered much. Erosion is a fact everyone needs to deal with now and the beach and water are still gorgeous. The wedding: I was immediately re-assured by the fact that everytime I emailed Mayra, the wedding coordinator, I received a response usually within a day. She was always re-assuring me that everything would be fine and her coordination of the event, especially since they do like 3 weddings/week, is flawless. As for the other receptionist staff, it was really hit and miss whether you got someone that knew their job very well or not. I had done up goody bags for everyone in my party to receive. At the beginning of the week, they were really good at handing out the bags to everyone as they checked in. But as the week went on, I had to keep calling reception and reminding them. Not that any of them were rude, but you could definitely tell that some were better trained than others. Anything about the wedding itself though, Mayra could do and I always had confidence in her. For instance, the day after arriving, I had to reprint out all of my leaflets because I had made an error and she let me come into her office and use her computer and printer. Especially as she has so many weddings to coordinate, I thought this was so nice of her. We had the civil ceremony at 4:00 and earlier in the week I became aware that the area of beach is already cloudy at 4. I was initially disappointed and wished I had made my wedding earlier but I got over it on the day and it didn\u2019t matter. It was all still beautiful. Resort staff came and collected me and the bridesmaids from my room and drove us via golf buggy to the beach. I was so excited to get married that I ran and galloped down the aisle and waved to all the people standing by to watch. I loved it and was so happy! The setting was gorgeous! Mayra had asked us to fill out a sheet earlier in the week with songs for each part of the ceremony i.e. walking down the aisle, signing the certificates, sand ceremony, walking out etc. and the music man did all this perfectly. After the ceremony, we had drinks on the beach and then the Mariachi band arrived! They were so awesome! By this time it was dark but we had a couple candle sticks in the sand and it was great. A huge bright full moon helped the lighting as well! Beautiful! From there we walked across the beach to the Steak House at 6:30pm. I remember getting a bit worried at this point because I was still barefoot and I didn\u2019t know who had the flip-flops I had brought to wear after we walked off the beach. I talked to the bridesmaids and a few others, and then I looked in the distance. There was Mayra, standing there with my flip-flops! Haha! Spot-on Sista! We were all seated at dinner and did the speeches. Plus we cut the cake before the meal so the photographer could get photos. We chose the cheesecake and it was so delicious. I totally regretted the next day that I hadn\u2019t asked for a slice to take back to the room. Mmmmm! And I think I\u2019ve went through the rest of the wedding (lobby bar and disco). I\u2019ve attached a couple pics of the wedding. By the way, we did buy the small photo package from the resort. They really do a good job and the colour in their photos came out brilliant! I don\u2019t have them yet because my in-laws took them back to Ireland with them as my hubby and I went on to Costa Rica for the honeymoon. The pics attached are from my brother\u2019s camera. We also bought the resort dvd which we hadn\u2019t planned. It is pretty cheesy with constantly having us kissing and stuff but it looks nice and the cheesiness will give us a good laugh someday. All in all, the place is great. There are a few hiccups like our minibar not being re-stocked. Even when we called reception about it, they still didn\u2019t re-stock it and we had to call again the next day. I might mention that this was my second wedding so I think I was a lot more laid back then another bride may be if it was her first. I did the big traditional castle wedding before and although those weddings are beautiful in their own way, I learned that you can lose yourself in the details of a big wedding when you need everything to be perfect, \u2026 and that\u2019s not what really matters. Like, I think in another situation, I would have been more disappointed with the flowers as they are not really what I had totally chosen or envisioned. But flowers are flowers and they are all pretty. Now that I have organised 2 weddings, I would pick the beach wedding at the Quetzal everytime hands down! The beauty, the colours in the background, Mayra\u2019s organisation, the fun, the feeling of it all cannot be outdone! Especially if you factor in the cost. Why spend a load of money for one day of your life when you can have the wedding day of your dreams along with a whole week of friend-and-family-packed fun! It's a great feeling to be laying at the beach on the day of your wedding sipping a margarita! If anyone is thinking about it especially for a wedding, I really don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed. I have grown up around beaches (Lake Erie beaches, all the beautiful Florida beaches, Myrtle Beach, Malaysia beaches, French Riviera beaches, South of Spain beaches, Majorca beaches, Costa Rica beaches, and this one was probably the top dog! And Mayra is awesone! You won\u2019t need to worry about anything! I definitely hope me and my new shiny husband will return for an anniversary one day!", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cGreat Place to stay\u201d", "Author": "RetiredPD", "ReviewID": "UR22502381", "Content": "We stayed at Iberostar Quetzal from November 28th thru December 4th.

What a difference a few months can make! Maybe they have new management. The property is still superb and the staff great however the management doesn't seem to care about the rights of the individual guests versus large groups. The dining room seemed like an out-of-control Kindercare with little kids as young as 2 yrs running around, , taking bites of food and putting it back, slamming into people, breaking dishes, etc. One boy was actually permitted to roller-skate during the lunch and dinner rush all around the tables and the buffet! Some of the women from these groups made a habit of standing at the buffet eating with their hands while socializing. One guy took all the little chocolates off the pastries at every meal and we can't even count how many people coughed & sneezed all over the food. Nothing was done by management or staff to change out the tainted food as was the case when the birds regularly ate off the buffet. This was the most unsanitary buffet experience we've ever had. We had a hard time enjoying the shows as all tables were taken over by these large families with their kids running all over the place even after 11PM in shorts, bathing suits, underwear, diapers, etc. Back in Feb kids were entertained at 8PM while elegantly dressed adults enjoyed the after 9:30 PM shows. Why bother dressing up. When we finally got a table in the back, we waited 45 min for a waiter to come after we flagged him down. At 7:30 pm middle aged and a few old men were skinny dipping in the ocean with their wives and daughters cheering them on -- not too nice when you have a 12 year-old daughter. The staff just looked on in disbelief and embarrassment. We were tired the entire vacation as every night we were awakened at least twice by people loudly talking in the halls and right outside the rooms -- and we stayed at 21 closer to the beach where it's supposed to be quiet if everyone shows a modicum of consideration. But we did have a wonderful time off the property doing tours and just visiting places on our own where we fortunately met up with courteous tourists who know how to have a good time. We suspect some of the Thanksgiving crowd might have been trailer trash whose trips were paid for by wealthy elders. What irked us was that management was totally about accommodating the large groups, leaving single families and couples to feel like second class citizens overall. We were denied entrance to the night club as that was taken over by a private party and yet another restaurant was taken over as well. We pay full price for partial amenities while groups pay discounted prices for full amenities. Doesn't make sense. On the other hand, the staff did the best they could to be kind and even protective of those of us with manners who were traveling independently. Maybe it's because we're respectful and tend to be heavy tippers. A couple of staff members reluctantly admitted that bad behavior is always expected at Thanksgiving. How embarrassing for us as Americans to hear that although they did assure us it's still better than when the Germans come in droves. We've decided that due to the unsanitary conditions of birds and people being allowed to eat right off the buffet as well as management's complacent attitudes about the safety and comfort of all the guests for fear of offending large groups, we will not return to this property as we had planned to do every year. We will however miss its majestic beauty and so many of the staff whose patience and kindness was beyond what anyone could expect.

Firstly, let me just give you a quick background on my previous travels to give you an idea on comparisons. I've been to Barbados, Dom Rep twice (Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus & Iberostar Dominicana), Egypt, Dubai, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, lots of places in Europe and will shortly be off to Maldives, Cuba and then Jamaica.. I have also been a travel agent for both Going Places & First Choice. This was the first time we'd been to Mexico and we were both absolutely blown away by this hotel. The IB Quezal & Tucan are the same hotel by the way and it does not make any difference which one you stay in. Although I did find that the IB Quetzal was generally cheaper (if you're booking from the UK). We flew with Thomas Cook which without a doubt the worst flight I have ever been on! After we booked it, we were then sent a letter to say that they would be going via Manchester on the way out to pick up people there which made the journey a lot longer plus we had a delay! The seats are absolutely awful and if comfort is important to you I would recommend going with somelike First Choice or Thomson. It's not the legroom that's the problem but the base of the seats that haven't got enough support and cut off the circulation in your legs! Saying that, I believe they have improved their seats recently (not sure if just legroom or not) and will check it out when I go to Cuba in April (Thomas Cook were unfortunately the cheapest!). Anyway, nightmare flight over, on to the hotel! I won't go over all the small details that have already been mentioned in other reviews but here are the highlights: - Beautiful gardens, well maintained and an absolute joy to walk through to and from the beach. You see so much wildlife along the way including my fiance's favourite - the monkeys! They roam freely around the grounds and we must have taken at least 100 photos of them! It used to take us ages to get to our destination! The palm trees have little fairy lights around them which light up the gardens at night and are gorgeous! I loved walking through the gardens on the little windy pathways in the evening listening to the wildlife! - The pools are lovely and a nice size with plenty of sun loungers. - The beach is absolutely gorgeous. The sea is a lovely colour of turquoise and there was always a nice breeze. I am very fussy with beaches as I spend most of my time on them. The only thing I would say is that when we went it was too rough on many days to swim but it still blew me away everytime I saw the beach. Personally I prefer calmer water but it is a lot of fun too in the waves. - The food was amazing! The buffets offer a HUGE selection of every type of food you could imagine, anyone that says differently in my opinion can't be on this planet! The a la cartes were all fab. My favourite being the Steak house - the steaks were perfectly cooked and my least favourite the Italian. The Japanese is a must for the entertainment factor as well as the food. They vary the buffet and lunches every day and one day they had a giant plate piled high with massive king prawns which were to die for! Also look out for the Paella on the beach, yum! - The drinks! Lots of cocktails to choose from along with the normal beers, spirits & wine! The wine is pretty good. The cocktails are best in the main lobby bar where they make the most lovely Pina Coladas - ask for extra coconut cream!!! - The staff were lovely, very helpful and friendly. The rooms were always spotless, air conditioning was fab, nice decor and we had a lovely quiet garden view room. Just a few tiny negatives: - I love the sun but still need some shade now and again. We used to have to get up quite early to find a sunbed with a palapa, particularly on the beach! It used to annoy me immensly seeing people playing towel games and not coming back to their sunbeds until the afternoon! What selfish people they are! The worst was after dinner when we used to walk around the pool where we would find towels, lilo's, hats, books all piled on the big undercover double sunbeds (not sure what they're called). Put it this way, they weren't there for long after I saw them - more like floating on the lilo in the Pool! Sorry if some people find this wrong but what they're doing is completely inconsiderate and out of order! Anyway, I do hope that Management find a way round this soon as it seems to be a problem with the majority of Iberostars! - LOUD guests from a particular place - you will know who I mean!!!! Why do some people (I'm not saying all) have to sit in the adult only bar which would actually be a lovely place to have a drink if it weren't for all the \"Woohoo, yeah baby!!!\" and \"yeah let's drink ourselves stupid and make a nuisance of ourselves!!\". I just don't get it sorry and this is not the hotels fault. In fact, there was quite a few occasion where they were extremely rude to the staff when they refused to serve them more alcohol because they had had a enough! - Again not the hotel's fault but the amount of people who pile on ridiculous amounts of food on their plate and don't eat it! What a shameful waste! - I am in my late twenties and although I like fun on holiday like everyone else, I also like some peace and quiet too! The star friends are great, they are brilliant with children, work very hard and are extremely friendly. However, I did find the Iberostar song that was played very frequently, very loud and very annoying! Along with the other music that they played for the activities such as water aerobics... It's just too loud and you cannot get away from it! Anyway, enough of that, I may sound like I'm moaning but they really are very small insignificant things that did not in any way ruin our holiday. We had an amazing time and will go back one day - when I have exhausted everywhere else! I'm not one to go back to the same place but this is definitely an exception! We also liked Playa Del Carmen, it's a really nice resort to visit in the evening for a change of scenery. We did a few excursions as well: Swimming with dolphins - ok but quite a few people to each dolphin and quite pricey although very enjoyable. Horse riding - excellent , with the chance to go in the sea with them up to their necks - unreal!, Tulum - Excellent, great guide, very knowledgable, beautiful beach, great photo opportunities. We did want to do Chichen Itza but it is a very long day on the coach and couldn't bear to tear ourselves away from the hotel for that long - maybe next time..........!!!

My husband, myself, our 2 children (ages 8 & 4) and my in-laws vacationed at the Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan from October 28th through November 5th. We booked with our travel agent and used Funjet as our tour company. Everything went smoothly and when we arrived in Cancun airport, our private (shared) transfer was waiting. It was just the 6 of us in the van because there were no other travelers from our flight going to Iberostar. The drive took about 45 minutes and we were greeted at the resort with warm smiles and a cool cocktail. Before I continue, I should note that this was our 4th time to Mexico, but the previous 3 times were all at the same resort in the Cancun hotel zone. Therefore, it is only natural that I compare the two resorts. CHECK-IN Check-in was fast, friendly and informative. Karina explained, in detail the layout of the resort and said that if we had questions at any time to let her know. ROOMS We were escorted to our rooms by golf cart and were very pleased with what we found. We were given the building and floor that we had requested by email, 2343. It was spotless and had a delightful view of the jungle. We were immediately greeted by a male Black Howler Monkey on our balcony; which we all found fascinating. Our building was about in the middle of the resort, but a tad closer to the pool and beach. Each room is equipped with a dispenser of shower gel (equivalent to Dove), and shampoo (no conditioner) a bar of soap, lotion, shower cap, iron, wood hangers (we brought more and was glad we did), coffee maker, with coffee prepacked in the filter, a huge container of water, powdered creamer, sugar, atrificial sweetener, tea bags and 2 coffee mugs. There is also a mini frig stocked with bottled water, cans of Coca Cola, Diet, Fanta Orange, Sprite, Mineral water and bottled Superior beer. We had 2 double beds and a nice sized sofa, but does not pull out to a bed. However, it was big enough for myself or my husband to sleep on, when we were tired of the kids trying to kick us out of the bed. There is also an extra pillow in the closet, a safe, clock, telephone, and info pertaining to the resort along with a room service and a la carte restaurant menus. On the second morning I wrote a note to our housekeeper in Spanish, requesting a certain amount of water and coffee and he honored our request each morning without having to ask a second time. Our room was always cleaned by 10:00 am and he did a fantastic job each time...very sweet man. FOOD There are 2 main buffets that serve all three meals, one by the Tucan lobby and one by the Quetzal lobby, but both are exactly the same. There is a buffet by the beach that serves only lunch and a smaller buffet a little further back by the pool that serves breakfast and lunch. For dinner, we ate at the Mexican, Japanese, and Italian (all twice). We couldn't get a reservation at the Steakhouse until 9:00 pm, so we skipped it. The other 3 were a toss up, but I would have to say that our favorite was the Italian. The first time I had the Lasagna and the second the Veal, which was amazing and I don't typically like veal. Service was impecable at all of the restaurants, including the buffets. Now comes the negative part. While the a la carte restaurants were fabulous, the buffets, were not all that great. Don't get me wrong, I could always find something good to eat, but because of the previous resort that we visited, it paled in comparison. The meat, especially the cuts of beef were always very tough and the fish was usually partially raw in the center. Breakfast was always very good, but the selection for each meal was the same everyday, except for an occasional switch in meat or pasta selection. The positive part is that the buffets were always so clean, which is a huge thing for me and given that they are open air, there weren't any noticeable problems with flies. Someone had mentioned several reviews back that there are problems with the black birds invading the restaurants and while they are there and noticeable, they're not bothersome. I think the resort has gotten creative about keeping this problem at bay because when we first got there, we noticed that the birds would swipe ONLY the yellow packets of Splenda (LOL) and then towards the end, the staff started covering the sugar bowls with a small plate. On Wednesdays they have a cookout on the beach for lunch; which was ok. And our favorite had to be the ice cream cart, just steps away from the sand....yummo!! DRINKS This was the biggest disappointment of all. Honestly, we all thought they were pretty bad. I can't quite put my finger on the problem, but I think it's the 'mixes' that they use. They didn't skimp on the alcohol, but for example, pina coladas, blue hawaiians, etc. had this wierd kind of taste, kind of a cross between a sour and metallic flavor. I finally found the Bahama Mama or Dirty Monkey (made with a bit of fresh banana), which was decent. I brought my bubba keg, but only used it the first day because it seemed that the quantity threw off the quality even more. It also seemed that the drinks in the a la carte restaurants were made a bit better, but unfortunately for me, I didn't find a pina colada that I liked. My husband usually orders margaritas while on vacation and he switched to the beer on tap. I would have been even more disappointed if it were really hot, because that is when you want to drink more. I think the biggest problem here, is that they were never consitent. One time you might get a decent drink, next might be terrible, next might be way too much alcohol, next really good and so on. Bottom line is that I don't care much about how much alcohol is used or what brand, I just want it to taste really good so if I were paying for the drinks individually, I may have ordered a second, but certainly not a third. BEACH Beautiful water, white sand, plenty of palapas and very relaxing. There are sandbags and the beach changes almost daily but I still loved it. Most of our stay we had red flag days with HUGE waves; which made for dangerous conditions. I am not joking when I say that we saw many people everyday getting help from the house doctor for broken shoulders, legs, arms and even a broken jaw. If you're going to goof around on the sandbags, sit and slide off....don't stand! Picture each sandbag as a HUGE SLIPPERY BRICK!! This beach is very clean and the staff is always walking around taking your empty glasses. If you see Margarita, say hi for us...she is the sweetest thing. We gave her a $10 tip everyday and she was always coming over and asking us if we needed anything. Even though the drinks were poor, it was worth it to get to know her. POOLS The pool is very nice, a little cold for me this time of year, but my kids loved it. There are activities in the shallow end by the massage huts that start around 11:30 am....\"Hey, hey babe..I wanna knooow, if you'll be my girl...say whoo, say haaa.\" We're still singing it and you will be too. My kids also loved the 'hot tub.' The temp was actually a little colder than the pool water itself. They have a decent sized childrens pool by the playground and kid's club. There is a sports pool where they play water basketball, but we never participated. And last but not least, there is an adults-only pool with bar service and tables with stools built in the water, but we did not try it since we had our kids with us. GROUNDS/ANIMALS This has to be the highlight of the resort. It is simply gorgeous and the staff is always trying to further maintain it's beauty by pruning plants, sweeping and mopping the walkways and cleaning up trash. For those of you who smoke (like me), there are ashtrays EVERYWHERE, yet I still saw many people discard their cigarette butts on the ground. I would hate to see a fire destroy this tropical jungle because of the carelessness of some humans...please be respectful. There were a few days where I would just walk along the meandering paths to take pictures and enjoy the sights and SOUNDS of the jungle. It is truly paradise. Always bring your camera because you will see monkeys, snakes, peacocks, aqoutis, chickens, flamingos, swans, ducks, cats and iquanas. I think when we were there, it was mating season for the peacocks because they were a little assertive. In fact, one day we were walking along and this man and his children each had a handful of bread and began to feed this ONE peacock. Of course my kids were intrigued and the man gave a bit of bread to each of my kids. The next thing you know about 25 additional peacocks swooped in, all making this awful screech sound, while charging toward us. The man shouted \"just throw it down and RUN.\" And we did, but afterwards, it was quite funny!! Also, one evening on the way back to our room, we were cutting through building 24 and saw this huge spider on the tile floor. I have included a picture of it and it was at that moment that I was grateful to have a room on the 3rd floor. When you see the picture, pay close attention to the size of the squared tile (6 inches) and compare it to the size of the spider.....eek! ENTERTAINMENT The Star Friends really work hard all day. As mentioned before, they start at about 11:30 am with pool games and water areobics, and they continue all day with various activities. I participated in the salsa and meringue lessons, spanish lessons and my husband played sand volleyball and olympic games everyday. They then move on to the shows in the theatre every evening. They begin with a kids show at about 8:00, followed by the more adult versions. We only attended the kids show once, because my 4 year old son was usually nodding off at the dinner table. We could hear the shows from our balcony and they sounded very good. One other activity that we thoroughly enjoyed was the pottery painting by the pool. The man who runs it is named Victor and he is wonderfully talented. My daughter painted a frog, my son Lightening McQueen and I painted a plate. They turned out awesome, especially after Victor added his final special touches. The pieces range from $15-$40USD and worth every penny. Make sure you bring extra money for these personalized souvenirs (you don't have to be artistic) and also some bubble wrap. SHOPPING/EXCURSIONS While researching this vacation, I thought I would want to go into Playa del Carmen to shop and have an authentic lunch, but once we got there, we really just wanted to stick around the beach. On our last full day there, we did walk down the Playacar strip to the little plaza and enjoyed ourselves. However we didn't purchase anything because they weren't really willing to make a deal. We did not go on any excursions this time, mainly because of my 4 year old, but my in-laws booked a Tulum/Coba tour with one of the tour desks in the Playacar Plaza strip. I think it was $57 per person which included transportation, lunch and tour guide for Tulum and Coba. Back to shopping...I ended up purchasing some things from the hotel gift shops. At the Quetzal shop I bought a T-Shirt from the 50% off rack that came to around $6 and then from the Tucan (which is larger) a Mexican blanket for $7.50, marracas, magnets, beaded ring, flip flops, and a Playa del Carmen note pad, all totaled around $30, plus $75 for our pottery. SERVICE Impecable!!! There are so many staff members in this resort and they all greet you with a friendly \"Hola.\" These people need roller skates, as they all work so hard and never slow down. One morning when we woke, we noticed that our frig didn't work. I notified the front desk and they graciously send a repairman to our room right away. Another incident that sticks out in my mind was one morning at the beach, we found a palapa but without chairs. A couple of minutes later, an employee came over and asked if we needed loungers and how many? We told him we would like 6 and a few minutes later, he and another employee returned with 6 loungers. I was very impressed. KIDS CLUB/ACTIVITIES Before coming to this resort, I emailed the head of the kids club to ask if my son could participate with his sister since he would be turning 4 during our stay and she graciously obliged. However, when we arrived Karina asked his age and I told her he would be 4 in a few days and she said that he could not go to the kids club. Since we were hungry and tired from the days travel, I decided to bring up the issue at a later time. The next day we went to the front desk, explained the situation to the man and he said, \"No problemo senorita.\" We walked the kids to the club, filled out the information and then my daughter didn't want to stay; consequently, neither did my son. Later on that day, my daughter decided to join them when they were at the pool, then off to lunch, movie, and then beach games. They had a great time, but she didn't want to go back because she said that she doesn't get to spend much time with us when she's in school, so she wanted to now. No biggie, there was plenty for them to do otherwise. I will say that the ladies in the kids club are wonderful. There are always 3 supervising the kids and you can tell that they really love their job. I thought it was amazing that they remembered not only my kids names, but also mine and my husbands. So don't feel nervous leaving your kids with them, they are in very good hands!! What we loved about this resort with children is that we always sat in the loungers on the opposite side of the massage hut. It was the best of both worlds, we could watch our kids swim in the shallow end of the pool, while we had our toes in the sand. Even though we were only about 50 feet away, I still made them wear arm floaties because there is not a lifegaurd on duty at the pool. HELPFUL TIPS Bring extra hangers, plenty of sunscreen, bug repellant, bubble wrap for breakable souvenirs, comfy shoes for the uneven paths, coffee creamer if you don't like milk in your coffee, and most importantly, lots of swimwear because it takes a long time for clothes to dry. A few extra outfits for your kiddos would be a good idea because they seem to get everything wet. I brought extra boxer briefs for my husband to wear under his swim trunks and he was glad I did because chaffing occurs easily. I also brought diaper rash cream and needed it frequently for my son because he was wet and sandy most of each day. Learn a little Spanish before you go....it helps a lot, especially when communicating to the housekeepers. SUMMARY This resort is simply breathtaking. The service is phenominal and there is plenty of activities to keep you busy if you're an on-the-go kind of person. Below, I have listed my own rating system comparing the Iberostar to the previous resort in Cancun that we have visited the last 3 years. I'm not listing the name of the other resort because I don't want to give the impression that I'm trying to deter anyone from visiting Iberostar. If you would like to know the name, you can send me a personal message and I will give you that information.

(We purchased a standard room and our travel agent got us a free upgrade to the ocean-view room.) Note that the hotel is situated where most of the rooms are not on the beach; only a few are near the ocean and have ocean views. However, the rest of the rooms, like the entire hotel, are situated in the middle of a tropical forest, complete with fabulous bird and animal life. The hotel\u2019s restaurants are set in this tropical paradise as well. It is quite wonderful to stroll through the walkways and check out the local wild life. Cameras are a must. The beach & the sea were kept sparkling clean, and swimming in it was pure heaven. The pool was large, looked great and even had a separate section for swimming and drinking. I say \u201clooked\u201d because we never used the pool. The sea was so fabulous; we never found a reason to swim in the pool. The food was not the greatest (we are New York City food snobs), but it was certainly plentiful and varied and did the trick. Again, the restaurant staff was superb. The dive shop folks were equally superb, very helpful, friendly and professional. If you don\u2019t leave the hotel, you pretty much never need money since everything is all inclusive. All in all, a terrific place to stay for all categories of folk \u2013 honeymooners, second honeymooners & families (singles, maybe not.)

Beach was clean and breathtaking, but not for snorkerling. The Diving was good, and the staff was excellent. They really keep a good schedule for keeping people were things are going on. The buffets close before lunch so they make you eat on the beach, pool closed at 7 inorder to have everyone inside to eat and see the Big Show. Very smart, good way to get the guest involved and meeting new people. Our girls had a great time, playing volleyball, dancing, wind surfing, diving they loved it all. We also went to swim with the dolphins. The best one is delphinus, you get 15 minutes training and 45 minutes in the water plus it only is in groups of six. Get the most for your money $149 US and transportation is only $5 if you want to watch but not swim. Beware photos and DVD is around 140-260 US. I think 6 photos are around 60US. Awsome thing to do. We also did the Tulum Extreme tour, wow this is a have to do. You see the Ruins, repael into a cave, Zip line and snorkel in a Cenote and the lunch was wonderful. This is an all day trip for around 100 US. Great day outing. Although we hated to leave the resort, the staff asked where we were all day. It was nice to have the staff notice we were gone.

Upon arriving early (1:00 - check in is not until 3:00), they not only had our room ready, but Karina at the front desk had upgraded us to the presidential suite at the Quetzal. OMG it was fantastic. It was a 2 bedroom, 3 bathroom penthouse with 2 private balconies and a deck complete with table & chairs, lounge chairs and a hot tub. I don't know what we did to deserve it, but I could not have asked for anything better! As it turns out, I liked the Quetzal oceanfront side better, it was 10 steps from the pool and beach - which was great, especially for the kids. The only downside was the loud music coming from the hotel next door, but we were so tired by the end of the day it didn't matter :) We had a wonderful time at the pool & beach. We never had any problem finding shady spots at the pool (it helps that kids get up so early :) ), and we just got umbrellas from the towel hut to use on the beach. (Hint: bring pool and sand toys from home) It was also nice that the restaurant by the pool/beach was open during the day - we ate there several times. It didn't have the same selection as the regular buffets, but it was easier as it was so close. We were very happy with the buffets. If you're on vacation to eat, I can see how people can get bored with the food, but it was perfectly fine for us and there were always selections to keep the kids happy ( a big plus). My only kid related food suggestion is if you order milk, order a glass of ice to go along with it. The milk there is like room temperature cream (not bad over ice though). We also ate at the Japanese restaurant and the steakhouse and both were nice. The Japanese was really entertaining and the food was great! All of the staff we encountered at the hotel was friendly and accommodating. We made a point to tip everyone, and it was clear that they appreciate it but don't expect it (hint: tip the bartender @ the pool right away - you should have seen my husband's drinks!!!). We also rented a car through the hotel and did a day at Xcaret (w/ the dolphin swim), and a day at Tulum. Well worth the price of the car, because I couldn't imagine going on a tour with small children. There is also a nice shopping \"mall\" just down the road from the hotel if you want to souvenier shop without going into town. All in all it was a wonderful trip and I would absolutely go back.

We had a fabulous experience. The hotel is nestled around a lush tropical forest and the view from any room is amazing. There are beautiful exotic animals everywhere too. Our room was immaculately cleaned daily and the double headed shower was quite enjoyable (we're thinking of installing one at home now.) We liked having our own private balcony, but the beds were pretty firm. We spent most of our days poolside, though the beach was very clean with plenty of beach chairs and shade. There was also a wide variety of nonmotorized water sports, but I will warn you there were a few topless women here and there (which I was surprised by since it is a family resort.) The pool is HUGE and its really nice because it slopes down from like 3 ft to almost 6ft. There are a ton of fun pool activities available all day long, that everyone is invited to join in, but if you choose to just relax, the pool is big enough that you won't be bothered by loud games. We loved the adults only pool, which was a bit cooler than the other pool and had a swim up bar. All of the pools close at 8 for cleaning, but by that time we were ready to do eat anyways. I would recommend going to as many specialty restaurants as possible for supper. The Japanese restaurant was AMAZING! The food at the buffets for breakfast and lunch is not gourmet, but it is good, and there is plenty of selection. We also went down to 5th avenue which is only $5 cab ride or you can rent a scooter for $40/day. There is a lot of really nice clean market area there and its also a lot of fun to go there at night for a cultural night out on the town. We enjoyed celebrating the Mexican Independence Day there. I also treated myself to a fabulous massage at Iberostar Spa. They offer a variety of reasonable services and also offer free sauna and hot or cold jacuzzi. We booked several adventures through Lomas travel at the hotel too. There is a van that picks you up and takes you to a marina about 30-45 min away where you can go deep sea fishing, spinning, snorkel, parasail, ride 4 wheelers, ride horses, jet ski, etc. Our last night there we went on a romantic dinner cruise where we got to see the sunset on the ocean then we came back ashore to a scrumptious 5 course candle-lit dinner on the beach with live saxophone music and dancing. It was FABULOUS! I would highly recommend it! If this sounds amazing and your considering a trip to PDC I would suggest that you bring a couple things that we forgot: mosquito repelent and a floatie for the pool.

The swimming pool is huge and beautifully surrounde by palms, grasses and cacti. The beach area, which was being re-constructed, was great fun. Warm water, lush coral sand and baking sunshine.

We arrived at the Iberostar Quetzal on Monday July 21, 2008 for my son's wedding that would take place there on July the 26th. There were 15 of us that arrived that day with 21 more coming in on Thursday. I had emailed the resort ahead of time requesting specific buildings and most importantly that some rooms be on the first floor. They did a great job honoring our requests except that my son and his fiance would be in the next building so they would not be in the same one as everyone else. The resort felt they would like this but my son would have rather been in the same building with us. That all worked out fine when more guests arrived on Thursday and were placed in the other building too, we were all in buildings 21 & 22 facing the pool. My elderly parents had a great ground floor room on a corner where they could sit on the patio or even in the room and see all of the group coming and going all the time. Golf cart transportation was provided any time they needed it. I had also emailed ahead for dinner reservations for the 15 of us so that we could dine together before our other guests arrived. They also fulfilled this request and we enjoyed the steak house on Tuesday evening and the Japanese on Wednesday. That was really nice because we usually travel with a large group and never get to book a meal together. I stressed over the wedding the whole week and when Saturday got there I wondered why I had stressed at all. The wedding coordinator, Mayra, and her assistant, Veronica, know exactly what they are doing. The wedding was much more wonderful than I ever expected, these ladies made it so easy on us. They handle everything and make you feel like the only family they are planning a wedding for. The wedding, dinner in the Mexican restaurant and the private reception in the disco were all perfect. We could not have been more satisfied! Then to top it off when my son and his new bride got to their room it was decorated all over with rose petals and that was so unexpected and made them so happy.

We were given our key cards and general directions. This was NOT a welcoming greeting, lugging our luggage with us, trying to find our room! Overall 4 out of 10. ROOM: The rooms are somewhat dated, but we who spends a lot of time in it? They were comfortable enough -- nice marble bathroom, large room area. The bed is definitely hard!!! We have a firm mattress at home, and even with the topper on it, it was very firm, as most beds are in Mexico and the Caribbean. We could occasionally hear neighbors, but this hotel was not nearly as noisy as some we've stayed at. Overall 7 out of 10. FOOD/DRINKS: The food was very good. This is where my husband and I disagree, however. If I like something, I can eat it every day; he, however, requires more variety. The main buffet was somewhat limited in their selections. We are not gourmet people by any means (at home we eat at Chili's, Applebee's, Olive Garden, etc.) I enjoyed the food the entire week, but my husband tired of it before we left. Just FYI for those that need lots of variety. We did book 2 restaurants -- the Steak House and the Japanese. Both were excellent!!! The men must wera pants in only some of the restaurants, not all--so ask before making your reservations if that's important to you. We ate lunch every day by the beach/pool and that was sufficient. Not great, but good enough. Specialty Restaurants: 9 of 10 (desserts were the exact same as on the buffet or it would be 10 of 10) Buffets: 7 of 10. BEACH: This is the make or break item for us. The water was beautiful, as others have said--not quite as clear as in Cancun, but gorgeous shades of turquoise and blue. The beach dropped off very quickly, however, and the swimmable area extended only 15 - 20 feet (just to the sandbags). Also, during the weekend the beach seemed extremely crowded. But we walked past the Sandos next door to an area that is not developed and had the beach almost to ourselves. I was very worried about the sandbags before our trip, and almost didn'[t book this hotel because of them. I shouldn't have worried, because we ended up playing on them and having a blast on days when it wasn't so crowded. One note about the umbrellas: yes, they are free and are quite nice to set up wherever you want them by your chairs. BUT, they ran out of them early in the day. We tried to get one after 9:30 a.m. one day, and they were already out. We watched for others' returning theirs and when we finally did get one, we had a 2-hour time limit on it. I mention this because I haven't seen it in any other reviews. There was often a breeze that helped, but the sun is HOT, so you will need some shade. 6 of 10. SHOWS: These are just extra for us, but we enjoyed them. They involve kids first (around 7, I think), then they play and sing live music and have dancing for those who want it. Next, the Star Friends have the audience participation shows, which can be really funny, depending on the participants. Finally, at 9:40 each night, they have the main show. Considering that the Star Friends have worked all day on the pool and beach activities, they do a great job. No, it's not vegas, but it was enjoyable enough. 8 of 10. TOURS/EXCURSIONS: We did the \"Mayan Adventure\", which was snorkeling and swimming in cenotes. This was definitely worth the money. As this was our 5th beach vacation, we wanted something different from anything else we had done, and this was it!! 10 of 10. OVERALL IMPRESSION: The people were all very nice and quick to offer an \"Hola.\" We took lots of $1 for tips, but didn't feel pressured to always give one. There were fewer Americans there than any other nationality -- something again my husband and I disagree on. I enjoy the other cultures. Yes, the Europeans were often rude -- cutting in line and they do not move over or yield when walking on the paths. I just learned to either let it go (I'm on vacation, right?!!) or cut right back. Am I glad we went? YES. Would I go again? No, because we prefer to see other places rather than return to the same places. Would I recommend to a friend? Probably, but with the understanding of the few negative things mentioned. I would definitely NOT pay full price, however. For my money, I have gotten much better at other resorts.

The white sand was soft and smooth, the water was a clear blue like nothing I have seen before. However, the beach and ocean where the only redeeming factors about my vacation there. I had been to two other all-inclusive resorts before my stary at the Iberostar Quetzal and loved my experiece at both of them. After arriving at the hotel, our rooms were not ready. We were told we could go eat and come back later to check on our rooms. At about 4:30 pm they were ready. At that time we read about the several rules about the food \"No food by the pool or beach, no food to be taken out of the buffet restaraunts, no food taken to your room from the restaraunts, and we were given \"towel cards\" for each person and were told that we could take the towel cards to the \"towel place\" to get clean towels for the beach. If you needed a clean towel you could exchange it. At the end of your stay you were to take your beach towel to the towel place and get your towel cards back or you would be charged 10 dollars for each towel card. On the second to last day at the resort our towels were taken from us while we were swimming. When it came time to check out the front desk clerk said we owed 30 dollars for the towels. I told him that I was not going to pay the fee because the towels were stolen from me. He had no sympathy and no manners in the matter. I argued that an all-inclusive resort should provide limitless towels for each guest and not require the guests to police there towels. It was a huge hassel we went around and around about it. He then suggested I \"find \"some towels or towel cards or I would not be able to check out. So that is what I did. I found some towels that were wadded up and lying around and gave them to him. Also, 20 minutes before check-out we called for a bellman and kept getting no response so we had to carry our luggage over rocks and wooden planks to the front desk. Overall, the food tasted the same at every restaraunt. We were only allowed two reservations at specialty restaraunts. They were stingy with drinks and not very friendly. The resort seemed to be under-staffed. I think that is why you had to be responsible for your towels and umbrellas and return them each day. I would not recommend this resort because I know how friendly and wonderful other places are. There were several other resorts along the same beautiful beach-stay at one of those places.", "Date": "August 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indian Trail, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWent for the Beach\u201d", "Author": "Miss-Bahama", "ReviewID": "UR18443997", "Content": "We just got back from the Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan resort and I was really looking forward to staying at this resort. We booked an Iberostar Fun for Less trip through Funjet because I have heard nothing but rave reviews about this hotel and the Iberostar chain. This was a relaxing vacation to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and to unwind after a successful school year. Our Background: We are both teachers in our 20's. This was my 4th trip to the Riviera Maya. I have stayed at the: Catalonia in Puerta Aventuras (June 2005) Club Tulum (Dec. 2006) Excellence Riviera Cancun (June 2007) Flight: We took USA 3000 from Detroit and was very impressed with their services. Especially in this difficult time for the airline industry, we were stunned to have an in-flight movie, and beverages offered to us TWICE during the short 3 1/2 hr. flight. Transfer: We took Lomas for the transfer. They did not have our hotel accurate on their check-in sheet. They had us going to Paraiso Beach instead of the Quetzal. We checked at the airport in the morning to confirm the hotel was the Quetzal. They had to make a few calls, but they did indeed take us to the Quetzal after several explanations. I am not sure if this was a mistake on Lomas or Funjet in the booking- it was a Fun for Less package, but we did confirm for the Quetzal twice. Check-In: We arrived at noon and our room was not ready. They told us to check back in an hour. We took that time to eat lunch at the beach buffet and explore the grounds. We had to wait a few additional minutes, but we were given a room before the stated 3pm check-in time so we were very grateful. The Room: Our room is almost exactly as requested by email a few days prior. I requested building 21 (to be close to the beach), 3rd floor, pool view. We did receive building 21, 3rd floor, but with a partial ocean view. It was a wonderful change. We did find the rooms to be a bit tired. We had broken tiles on our floor, and there have been obvious repairs to the tiles in the bathroom (a slight discoloration). The bedding and curtains are slightly worn, and the room is showing signs of aging. This isn't a new resort, and the room isn't the most important thing. But, it is noticeable. One thing I did like is that each room has a repairs form to fill out. Our lights didn't work, and they were immediately replaced the next day. One negative about our room's location is the noise. The Quetzal side sits right against the RIU Yucatan next door and every night we could hear the music from their theater until 11:30pm. We are early to bed types, so that did bother us a bit, but it didn't cause us to change rooms which we could have requested. Just FYI. The Food: This is the disappointment of the resort. It is definitely 3 star food. Yes, I did read reviews before I left so I was prepared. No, we never went hungry. This was very basic buffet food. Breakfast was my favorite- all sorts of yummy treats: doughnuts, breads, eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, coffee, juices, cereal, fruit, etc. We really stocked up at breakfast, very enjoyable! Lunch, we ate at the beach buffet and at the main buffet. We didn't especially like the main buffet so we ate at the beach most days. Guacamole, pasta, nachos, burgers, fries, pizza, etc. We could always find something, but it wasn't spectacular. Dinner buffet was the most disappointing so we tried to eat at the specialty restaurants as much as we could. Again, there is a lot of choices- we just didn't find any of them to be great. We LOVED the Japanese restaurant, we tried to go twice but couldn't get in after our original reservation. This is the BEST restaurant on the premises. The steakhouse was surprisingly good as well- my steak was juicy, cooked well, and flavorful. The Italian was enjoyable and the Tropical was okay- not much flavor here. At all the specialty restaurants (except the Japanese) there is an appetizer buffet and then you order your meal. The food was good, and we were always able to order a dish to share on top of the our \"real\" order. We usually ordered a plate of shrimp to go with our main courses. We did see LOTS of shrimp on the buffets and in the specialty restaurants, but no lobster (unless you count lobster bisque soup). Both buffets (the Tucan and Quetzal side) are exactly EXACTLY the same. Even if they have different theme nights (International is the the EXACT same choices as Carribean). The seafood night is hardly seafood night at all- just a few extra fish dishes. We did order room service. As another reviewed stated this looked way more amazing than it tasted. However, we did enjoy the salads, chicken fingers, and tacos. The Pool: The pool itself never feels crowded, but the loungers by the pool have a LOT of foot traffic going by- not really a place to find a quiet niche. We swam or rather soaked in the pool a bit each day. It's pretty much a big circle with a few islands and fountains in it to keep it aesthetically appealing. They do have an activity pool which is nice, so the kids aren't playing ball when you are trying to relax. We did soak in the pool water temp. jacuzzi, but if you want a REAL hot tub, go to the spa (it's FREE). The Beach: I wanted a beach vacation with turquoise water and this hotel delivers. The beach is wonderful (there is hardly a sign of beach erosion troubles by this resort) and the water is clear and gorgeous. We had Red, Yellow, and Green flag days during our stay and we liked the Red and splashing in the waves the best. Be careful on the sandbags, they are slippery and we did see some pretty nasty falls. The sandbags are really not that big of an issue, but Sandos next door hardly has them at all, and they do have a wonderful stretch of beach, but Iberostar's is just fine. We LOVED relaxing under our Palapa every day. We wanted to get one in the front row and by 8:15am they filled up, but there were plenty of other spots available (and always chairs that you could use with an umbrella available at the towel hut). Yes, there are MANY Europeans, and there were LOTS of topless sunbathers. It didn't bother me, but it was more prominent here than at other resorts. Topless sunbathing is not allowed at the pool, if you want to stay away. The chairs filled up at the pool later in the day. If you are searching, go to the kiddie pool- we always found chairs to relax in around 3:30pm when we were done with the beach. Service: The service was good. I was surprised that most of the employees spoke English rather than Spanish. I missed the \"Hola\" and \"Buenas Dias\" that I have gotten at the other resorts in the past. I did greet the employees in Spanish, some acknowledged, some did not. Some employees did not want to be bothered with my minimal Spanish and continued to speak to me in English after I initiated a Spanish conversation. This is one hotel where I did not get to practice as much Spanish as I would have liked. A few employees did oblige me, and I really appreciated it! Overall, service was efficient and done with a smile. The grounds: The grounds is what makes this hotel unique. The jungle paths are fun (but most likely difficult for handicapped guests) and we enjoyed the daily animal sightings (and hearing the monkey grunts). It is a very tropical feel and it was very nice. The buffets are open air surrounded by water which is very beautiful, the Tucan lobby is tastefully done with marble, and the Quetzal side has shiny wood planks and wonderful waterfall views. Overall: It is a good resort. I am not sure it is worth all the hype and awards. It is definitely a resort that caters to fun and groups rather than a quiet ,relaxing vacation- but that is to be expected at this price point and being a family resort. Next time we want to try Sandos (it is newer and has better food from what I hear). We went for the beach this resort had to offer and I was not let down, but I do think the resort as a whole could use a facelift.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "lubbock", "Title": "\u201cgreat resort\u201d", "Author": "bstb", "ReviewID": "UR18282726", "Content": "WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

We contacted a travel agent saying we'd like to take a vacation somewhere around the caribbean or mexico for under $1,500. She came up with five places for us to select and this was the resort we choose, Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan in Playa del Carmen. It had tons of things to do other than going to the pool or the beach. We left May 17,2008 and we had a really rocky start with our plane being delayed 2 hours. Let's just say it was a very long day and we were tired and cranky. Playa del Carmen is roughly 60 miles south of cancun or an hour drive from the airport. We finally arrived at the resort and my jaw just dropped. The place was picture perfect. The staff was friendly, eager to meet you, and helped you with whatever you needed. Upon check-in, it's tradition that you have a drink. After that, we went exploring to check out the rest of the resort. So let me tell you a little bit about the resort...The whole resort is outside, except for the restaurants and the rooms. The pathways were lined with water and flowers. Also mayan statues and ruins. Everything had a tropical feel to it, even to colors of the buildings. Between the two sides, Tucan and Quetzal, they have a rain forest. You'll see peacocks, Large rodents, and Iguanas. On the Tucan side, they have tucans and on the Quetzal side they have Monkeys. Also separating the two sides is a huge pool. They have many pools; volleyball/sports pool, adult pool with swim up bar, kids pool, aerobics pool. You can even learn to scuba dive in the pool, they have that available. They also have beach volleyball, and beach botchy. What I loved most about This resort was the star friends. The Star Friends are the people (staff) that do the activities and shows on the resort. They know everything that's going on. They instructed different activities or sports everyday so you know that there will always be a game of volleyball or water polo going on. Anyway, about my trip, I loved the fact that it's conviently located close to shops, other bars, etc... One night we walked down to the shops. It was only a ten minute walk. The next night we took a cab down to the strip of bars and shops. Since we booked our trip through GoGo travel, we had the opportunity to book some excursions. Although we didn't book any you could do an adventure tour where they take you zip-lining through a forest and they also have a natural lazy river. You could also go scuba diving in a lagoon or parasailing. They have shows every night and dancing with a live band after each show. We saw a lip sync show (Justin Timberlake, Jennifer Lopez, Michael Jackson, The blues Brothers), a traditional Spanish dance, The famous Newly Weds Game, Mr. Iberostar 2008, and others. And after the shows, all the star friends go to the dance club inside the resort (The Mascara Club). They also have, every friday night, a group of people who go to cancun to go dancing. A bunch of star friends go and get other people to go...a bus shows up after the show on friday and they take you to cancun and bring you back. Unfortunately My friends and I were unable to go since we were leaving early Saturday morning. Also what I loved was they had either a live guitarist or saxophone player at the bars at night. THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW: - bring plenty of sunscreen, sunscreen is really expensive down there. - Make your reservations as soon as you wake up in the morning. I think you can only make two-three reservations at one time. The steak house fills up the quickest. - The beds are kind of hard but you can ask for an egg top or something to put on the bed to make it more comfortable. - After a few days of being outside all day and getting used to the humidity (since the resort is completely outside), I got dehydrated and got very sick. They do stock your fridge every other day in the rooms so you'll never go thirsty.

We have been to Cancun several times, but this was our first time in Playa. We were not disappointed. We were a group of 6- myself, my husband, my son (17), my daughter (20), and my parents. There was a wide variety of ages- from small children to seniors- and something to do for everyone. We live in the Dallas area and met people from all over the world- Germany, England, New Zealand. Not to mention people from all over the U.S. Everybody we met was so friendly, as was the staff. Most of what you need to know has been posted. Do be prepared for an hour's drive from Cancun- with stops at other resorts to drop off people. Our rooms were in the 27 block- a pretty far walk to the pool/beach- but close to the lobby and restaurants. The lobby, lobby bar and buffet restaurants are all open-air, but we never got too hot. The area surrounding the lobby is really pretty- a lush, jungle, tropical feel. You will see monkeys, parrots, flamingos, peacocks, iguanas, etc... As stated before- the pool area is awesome. It's a lagoon type pool and it is huge. There is the \"aqua pool bar\" at one end- you get out of the main pool and go down some steps to the aqua pool. It was very quiet when my mother and I went there- we sat at a table and bar stools that are in the pool. Very relaxing. Though the next day- there was a rowdy group there so I guess it varies. My husband and son played water basketball in the activity pool and they really enjoyed that. The beach was gorgeous- as everyone has said- clean and well-kept. We didn't have any trouble finding chairs out there. We did see some topless women so if that offends you just be aware. Also, there are people trying to sell you things on the beach. Just tell them \"no thanks\" and they will move on. You can rent towels and umbrellas at the towel hut. I highly recommend the umbrellas! I am a sun lover but that sun is intense. You will want shade at some point during the day. There is a pool bar between the beach and pool with pretty good drinks. Try a \"Dirty Monkey\" :) The rooms were nice and always clean. Showers were large. Beds were \"firm\", but we were so tired after a long day on the beach that we didn't mind. FYI- when your balcony door is open- the AC goes off. We found that out the hard way! Just shut that door and it will come back on. There are no elevators- this hotel is a bungalow style and all room doors open to the outside. The food was good- we were pleasantly surprised. We ate at the buffet and there was a HUGE variety of food. Breakfast was probably the best. We tried to get into one of the restaurants the first morning we were there- but they were booked up. That was the one negative. I agree with the previous reviewer about the wine- not the best. But all of the other drinks I had were great. I would suggest you go into Playa Del Carmen- it's worth it. We took a cab- it's a 5 minute drive and costs $5. The shuttle bus driver from the airport told us we could walk- but it's pretty far from the hotel. There are some neat shops there and you can get good bargains. The view of the beach from Senor Frogs is amazing- worth a picture or two! A note about leaving- our plane left at 9:30am and the Lomas bus (the shuttle people who take you to and from the airport) picked us up at 5:30am! We didn't really understand why we needed to leave so early. We sat at the airport for 2 hours just waiting for our plane. I'm not sure if that is standard departure time- but be aware of that. Also, know that you can not take alcohol purchased in Playa in your carry on bag. It has to be in checked luggage. I would go back to the Quetzal in a heartbeat- I just can't say enough good things about it. If you want an easy, relaxing, wonderful vacation with beautiful scenery- this is the place for you.", "Date": "June 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "minnesota", "Title": "\u201camazing experience at the iberostar quetzal\u201d", "Author": "mgoblue1990", "ReviewID": "UR16974011", "Content": "We stayed at iberostar quetzal for eight nights, and had a wonderful time! The staff was funny and friendly, and very helpful. The service was quick and efficient. (one highlight of the maid services was that the maids would come in and sprinkle rose pettles and chocolate on the bed!) The food was delicious, and the hotel was full of wild life and nature. We really enjoyed our stay. We booked this vacation through fun jet. A fun jet represenitive was always in the lobby and would help you set up day long trips to xel-ha, tulum, snorkeling excursions, etc. Those trips were all very fun and easy to get to. They just give you a time and where to catch the bus, and you're led the rest of the way. Our family has two adults and two children, and there was something at this resort to fit each of our personal likings. The \"star friends\" were setting up fun, family friendly games. There is a humongous pool there. It took for ever just to swim across it. It has a beautiful lay out and a fountain in the middle. The beach is just a few paces away. It is clean and the water is blue. We ate at all of the restaurants in the resort, there was a breakfast buffe that we ate at every morning, it had great food and beautiful surroundings. Our only complaint is food related, though: the lunch. It was a buffe right by the pool, and the food wasn't very well done. But that is the only negative thing we have to say! Our favorite restaurant was bonsai, the japanese restaurant. We set up many fun activities through the hotel. We did an hour long snorkeling excursion, the guide was excellent and we saw many beautiful fish. We parasailed, banana boated, and kayaked. It was all great. We had a great time watching all the evening shows, that was a big highlight. The dancers were fenominal and there were always activities the audience could participate in.

The kids miss them already. Jose Gabriel has promised our son Simon a necklace just like his own with a star. We never thought he would remember... but on the last night of our stay he came to Simon and gave him the necklace. Simon was stunned... and so were we!

Thanks to all the great people that work at the Iberostar Quetzal to make the guests vacation a vacation they do not forget. We can not wait to go back! The only thing that we have noticed that was negative compared to our previous stay is, that the quality of alcoholic beverages is not as good as it used to be. We are wine drinkers and the red wine in all the locations of the resort except the restaurants (Mexican, Italian, Steakhouse etc.)is of worse quality than before.

I e-mailed the hotel 2 weeks prior to leaving to ask for a room in block 21 or 22 on the 3rd floor which I had read on previous reviews was near the pool and in a fairly quiet setting. We were given room 2251 which was on the 3rd floor and had a slight view of the pool and very peaceful. On arriving at the airport you will find no reps are allowed in the airport, they all have to wait outside now but they do have their own reps in there who will try and get you to start talking to them finding out about your resort but only to find after a lengthy conversation that they are selling timeshare! So just ignore them and go straight outside where your reps will be waiting. On arrival at the hotel, which I wont bore you with all the details, as it is exactly what people say it is - Fabulous - have ready two dollars for the porter who will bring your cases to your room. Book your reservations for all the restaurants as soon as possible, then if you like a particular one and want to go again, just put your name down again, they will let you know if you are able to eat there again or put you on the cancellation list. We were lucky to eat in the Italian and Steakhouse twice. Ladies , if you like a nice cup of English tea with your HUGE slice of gateau about 3.30 / 4pm when they bring them out, please take your own brand as their tea just isnt the same!! We only did the one tour, the Jungle Tour which actually isnt through any jungle but is driving your own speedboat for 45 mins each way, stopping off to go snorkelling where you will see loads of exotic fish. You will have your photo taken as you go speeding along and they try to sell you this with a dvd when the tour has finished. Believe me the dvd is not worth the money, it is only still photos of the fish you will have seen and your picture in the speedboat, think it was 27 dollars, bit of a rip off. You are best to take a waterproof camera and do your own! Dont forget your mosquito repellant, being in a jungle setting, there are plenty to nibble at you. Have your camera with you at all times as you never know when you are going to see the monkeys, peacocks, etc every day we found something different to take a photo of. A cab into Playa Carmen is 5 dollars and well worth a visit, plenty to see and bars to sit in and people watch. Please, please, please use the free safe in your room right up to the last minute you leave. I made a silly mistake of taking out 100 dollars ready for the departure tax the day before we were leaving and tucked it into my mobile phone pocket in my handbag that I would be using for going home with and put it in the cupboard in the room at the back. When I went to get it out to pay the departure tax, it had gone. So please look after all your valuables. Apart from that, yes it was a brilliant holiday, as I've said everything already mentioned in other reviews are as it is, the pool is like a lake, it is HUGE, the food is great and the star friends work really hard.

The resort's beach was under construction, but no one seemed to notice. The massive sand bags that extended out into the water looked like rocks at first and people actually used them to their advantage, jumping off and sunning themselves on them. We didn't really have an issue getting chairs for the 70+ guests when we moved poolside. The food was good for an all-inclusive resort and the service at every restaurant/buffet was great. We had heard complaints regarding the hard beds, but didn't notice ourselves. Overall, I would recommend this resort for a vacation, especially if you come with a group of friends or family.

We were not disappointed a 2nd time. In fact, the food was even better than the first. We liked the buffet just fine and booked four a la cartes. The Carribbean one was closed but we went to Mexican La Hacienda, Italian, Japanese and Steak house. All were good. The staff outdid themselves because the 2nd week we were there, the resort was only 70% filled. The beach was not a disappointment because I knew before going about the erosion and sandbags. So we walked south past Sandos Playacar and loved the virgin beach there. Every day we saw people working on the grounds to keep them beautiful. We saw monkeys, peacocks, those little groundhog guys, flamingos, turtles, swans, waterfalls, and all kinds of palm trees and semi jungle trees, etc. It's the garden of Eden. The resort's a blast of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch. Room service was great, constant replenishing of drinks/beer, room service, cleanliness, pillow chocolates, rose petals, curtain and towel art. If we ran out of something in the fridge, a call to Guest Services and they'd be right up with whatever we needed. I love the showers in this resort. Big and ceramic tiled, with two types of shower options, the tall one at the top, or a handheld shower. The resort is located 40 minutes walk to Playa del Carmen or 10 minute cab ride. It's 5 minutes walk to a shopping plaza where you can get jewellry, clothes, any kind of gift. We also took a tour Tulum and Beyond, and they picked us up from the IB Quetzal and dropped us back. Tulum is very close also. Then we cabbed for 120 pesos (12 bucks) to Xcaret which is also close. We went into PDC a couple times and once ferried over to Cozumel to rent a car, snorkel at Dzul Ha, and drive around the east coast of the island. There's so much to do, but we loved the lazy days on beach, pool and swim up bar. IB Quetzal's night entertainment is very good. There's always a huge audience and people participate, dance and have a great time. My mom actually won Miss Iberostar 2008 and she's 75! The Star Friends had established great relationships with children and were very helpful to my mom while she was on stage. The Star Friends are second to none - all from different parts of the world; Canada, USA, Australia, Belgium and even Thailand! Of course there are many from different parts of Mexico. Mexican staff, waiters, etc. are incredibly friendly at this resort. We tipped $2/day for the chambermaid, $5 for the bellboys and $2 for cabbies and waiters. Bars we usually tipped $1 per waiter/bartender it all depends - some are so good and you want to give more. But you would not have to tip one cent and you would still get very good service. The lobby bar is a great place to relax, every night they had a beautiful musician, either guitar, keyboard or some such thing and the waitresses and drinks were plentiful. There were constant activities going on in the day, archery, pool and beach volleyball, aerobics, yoga, tennis, cyclying, aquasize, and more. There was lots of room around the pool and on the beach. One thing you would have to do before choosing this resort is fully understand the condition of the beach so you don't have any disappointment.

Oh but joy we were given free headsets for a film we couldnt see. Never mind we landed at Cancun airport in brilliant sunshine that only left us briefly one day the whole fortnight. We arrived at the TOUCAN QUETZAL HOTEL to find smiling faces and a lovely cooling fruit cocktail.Check-in was quick and soon we were in our colouful air-conditioned room changing into our shorts. The rooms are spacious with a massive king size or two doubles. The mini bar is always restocked as was the tea and coffee. The shower is also on the big side. Every day we had new towel art done by our very hard working maid. THIS HOTEL IS PARADISE. There are more birds.flamingoes.peacocks.ect in this hotel than in the aviary down the road that charge \u00a310 per person and is a waste of money to anyone staying in the Toucan or Quetzal. These two hotels are side by side and mirror each other. Residents can use the facillities in both. We stayed in the Toucan side. One tip is to book the speciality resturants on arrival as they soon get booked up. The Japanese is an experience not to be missed. The Mexican, where our daughter had her reception, and the Italian were very lively with fabulous food and the steaks in the steak house were spot on. The buffet resturants are lovely. Lots of choice with roasts most nights ,masses of salads veg ect. My daughters three yr old more than we hav e ever seen her. She had a great time on this holiday. Lunch is served at the buffet or beach resturant . There is always a barbie going at the beach. Then there are the cakes. they are to die for Especialy the ones served for afternoon tea. Dont go to this hotel if you want to loose weight, The bars have every branded drink you could want. The best one ,we thought ,was the one in reception which had a guitarist , saxofonist or mariachi band playing in the evening. The star friends were the entertainment team and put games on around the pool through the day and first class broadway shows on in the large theatre at night. There is an early show for children . They work so hard day and night to make sure you enjoy yourselves but never hassle you if you just want to relax. Which i must say we did more of here than we ever do. My husband likes to explore . We did but he was content to stay by the pool or on the beach some days. The family couldnt believe their eyes. Unfortunatly the beach is eroding but they have placed large sandbags to slow this down. These just look like rocks so they dont spoil anything. There are plenty of excursions available. My new son-in-law went swimming with dolphins and said it was the experiance of a lifetime.We all went to Cancun but not by taxi or tour as this would of been expensive. We got a taxi to Playa del Carmen bus depot then got a coach to Cancun costing $3.6 each then the number R1 or R2 bus which costs 40pesos any where you go on it to the sea front .It was no hassle honestly. the coaches have reclining seats and tv screens, although its all in spanish. we saved a fortune. We went to Chichen Itza on an organised tour. It was good but we wished we'd done that on the bus as we didnt have much time there. Now for the wedding. It was fantastic. The best wedding iv ever been to.It was so well organised. Everything is done for you. There are no worries. Our daughter was lying by the pool on the morning of her wedding and said \"i cant believe im getting married today im so relaxed\". The setting in the garden was beutiful and so private. Te flowers were breathtaking as was our stunning daughter. The registrar was realy nice and the ceremony very moving. We had photos on the beach and a video of the whole thing. I know they have a wedding most days but they still made our daughter and her husband feel special. We cannot praise this hotel highly enough We had a brilliant time and Playa del Carmen is a great place and so close by. We hope to return.

The Japanese steakhouse restaurant was great, with an incredibly good Tepan chef. The atmostphere is very nice, based around natural jungle settings, with many different types of animals, etc... The beach is adequate, yet somewhat crowded. However, there are some bad points, which must be mentioned. The beds are very hard, but I was extremely tired every night, so I got sleep anyways. The buffet gets old; the same foods over and over again just isn't very satisfying. They allow only one restaurant reservation for every 3 nights stay, so they limit your \"all-inclusive\" experience. The drinks were weak, and they didn't even have the correct ingredients for a Mai-Tai; I love tropical drinks, but resorted to simple beer, when I couldn't find a tropical drink that was made correctly. There are a ton of mosquitos; not sure if it was the time of the year, or if it was because of the jungle atmosphere, but anybody that stays here better lather up good with the bug spray. The hotel should really think about spraying. Finally, this is supposed to be a family oriented hotel, so we weren't exactly prepared for topless sunbathing, but there were a few people. It is supposed to be illegal in Mexico, but they weren't enforcing it. Overall, it was a pretty good stay. I just think with a little work, this could be a first class place.

Another disappointment was they didn't welcome us back since we stayed at the Iberostar Del Mar in 2006. And I was sort of expecting a big to do since I had seen that there were big welcomes to returning customers when we were there before. Other than that everything was fine, food wasn't as good as I remember it to be in 2006 at the Del Mar. Star Friends were awesome. A group of people that entertain you. They are the best thing about the Iberostar's. They organize beach and pool games. And also do the entertainment at night. Rooms are small and beds are hard. But the place is absolutely beautiful. Okay, so day 2 we asked to be moved to the Del Mar because of the beach. They didn't have any rooms there but they did at the Maya. Which is an upgrade from both the Del Mar and the Quetzal.

Having researched many reviews by others, we selected the Iberostar Quetzal and booked through Funjet. Once you deplane, all guests are sent to speak with informational agents in the airport and ours explained how to find the Lomas driver in \"smurf\" colors. We were 4 people smushed into the last row seat of a van for a 45 min drive south to the Playa del Carmen area. Our other choice was to wait 30 more min for the next group and have more seating room, but we were too anxious. All prior reviews of the Iberostar are very accurate - the beds are not too hard, the beach sand bags can be turned into play slides, the buffet is okay but does get old, all 4 a la carte restaurants are very delicious and attainable by asking after 4:00 pm, the waitresses in the lounge areas work very hard, and a tip to your room maid in the very beginning can bring dramatic towel sculptures. Our girls were disappointed with the Star Kids program as the other participants tended to be too young, however, \"Andy\" informed them of a teen-age disco located outside the lobby and to the right where they dance from 11:00 pm to 2:00 in the morning. They were delighted as many other teen-agers from Toucan joined in. We found, as did another reviewer, that one gets too relaxed in between dinner and the 9:45 show so we began booking the a la carte at 9:00 seating and then just meandered over to the show. All shows we caught were very good. We also found, as did another reviewer, that the bbq lunch down near the beach was delicious and beat going up to the buffet. Several in our party burn easy and we often rented 2 umbrellas for down at the beach. Never a problem. We were surprised to see so many topless women, and to see that they sought lounges right at the main entrance/exit to Quetzal's beach. Please warn your kids that picking up the phone begins a min of about $10 as our daughter's guest racked up $70 in 3 calls home to check-in with her parents. We went on several tours pre-booked from the internet. This is absolutely not necessary as the Quetzal has representatives tucked away in the lobby - one fellow was the apparent owner of the Tulum/Xel-Ha trip as we later saw him on tv. He explained that I overpaid by $30 for 4 tickets on cancun.com although I thought I was saving 10%. Tulum was beautiful, hot, and very crowded with zillions of tourists. Our tour guide was one of the few women guides and was fantastic. Please note that when you do the combined tour, you only spend about 4 hours at Xel-ha and this is truly not enough time to see the whole park. The girls did the dolphin program here and the 30 min program for $90 was just fine. One can stand opposite the group in the pool and take great pictures without having to spend $19 later or $70 for the dvd. We also did the atv tour through Yucatan ATV which is about 15 min away and the taxi was very cheap from Quetzal. The girls absolutely loved it. They provide masks for the cenote which was a great respite from the dirt of the atv jungle roads. They also sell bandanas there for $5 which are necessary. Our greatest trip was to X'caret which we also booked through a tour. Nothing is included - bring towel,masks, and money for their delicious lunches. Do not go to the restaurant at the end of the park as it is a $35 pp buffet! Quetzal is one of the first hotels to begin the route on the main hotel road so we stopped at several hotels and compared notes. It would seem Quetzal is one of the few that have the \"jungle\" in between. Our atv guide explained that the rodents are a delicacy like rabbit. The hotel employs people to clean up the poop round-the-clock. The peacocks were loud and nest through out the hotel facility so it is luck of the draw to get away from them. Building 22 faces the kitchen of the steakhouse and is loud until the dishes are done, about 10 pm. Building 21 can probably hear the new construction the best. Building 27 and 26 are nearest the lobby, jungle. We were on the first floor of building 22 and were thinking about moving, but the noise fades away, you get used to the peacocks, and any where seemed the same pros/cons. The place is fabulous.

This trip was better than the first. Of course you will read reviews complaining about their beachfront that was altered by bad weather but the grounds are so beautiful it did not detract from our experience. Iberostar is a great destination for groups large or small because there is something for everyone. You can have a relaxing time on the beach (Private so no vendors trying to sell you anything) or action packed vacation full of activites, sports, and lots of dancing. Our group had 4 generations and everyone was equally satisfied. The staff is what really makes you feel pampered. Begining at the front desk everyone was friendly, wait staff, excellent chefs, bartenders, and even the housekeeping staff add extra details to the rooms. By far the friendliest staff are the Star friends; they go out of their way to make sure the guests are having fun and they put on nice shows with some intricate choreography thanks to the choreragrpher, Beto. Some of the other Star friends that were so approachable were Lara , Sara, Adrian, Roberto, Ricardo, Miguel, and their leader Gael just to name a few. So anyone that makes it to Iberostar, remember the Star friends are great resources to get advice about day trips and nightlife (which in Playa is excellent) You have to hit the Blue Parrot and Coco Maya. Iberostar Quetzal and Playa Del Carmen are worth every penny spent!", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Grand Rapids, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Tropical Retreat\u201d", "Author": "AdventureKim", "ReviewID": "UR15004856", "Content": "After reading up on a lot of reviews, we decided on the Iberostar Quetzal and were extremely satisfied with our choice. The atmosphere was very tropical with a jungle style to it. We enjoyed walking the stone paths through the jungle and sitting on our balcony listening to the birds and watching for the monkeys. There were a few main things that were important to us on this trip, so I've categorized them with our comments below: Beds: we read many review that said the beds were horribly hard and uncomfortable and we were a bit worried because sleep was important to us this trip. We read somewhere that you could ask for the styrofoam egg carton style pads to go on top and when inquiring at the front desk, they assured us they would have one sent up to our room. It was never delivered. We decided to try out the bed for one night and then follow up in the morning if needed. To our surprise, we slept like a rock. Even though we are extremely picky and the beds did appear hard at first, we slept like babies and never needed the egg carton pad. Food: The food was great at the buffet, but by the 4th or 5th night, we did get a little tired of it. There was always something good, but they didn't switch it out much from night to night. I would definitely recommend making as many reservations at the a la carte restaurants as allowed. We tried the steakhouse and the mexican restaurant and both were fantastic and gave us some variety. Kids/atmosphere: being a younger couple with no kids, but older than the college crowd, we wanted to make sure that we had a good medium between party palace and kid city. This was the perfect place for that. It was very laid back and had a good combination of people with a lot of programs to keep the kids busy and out of the way. Plus, the pool was big enough to make plenty of room for everyone. You could also enjoy the adults only bar/pool. Entertainment: There were shows every night at 9:45, but there was nothing to do between dinner and the show, which usually found us back at our room getting too lazy to go back out to the show at 9:45. It would've been nice if they had some more entertainment, like a beach band or something to have a margarita and kick back to. Lounge chair availability: We were concerned with having to get up at the crack of dawn to reserve a seat, but found that there as always a good seat to come by, no matter the time of day. If you wanted something very specific, you may want to get out there by 7:00am to get it, but if you are not too picky, there were plenty of good seats. The rooms were about 80% full at the resort at the time. We found ourselves heading to the beach at 7:30am each day anyways because of our early retirements each evening, but it was great to be on that schedule to get the full benefit of the sunshine all day. Who wants to sleep away the day when the sun goes down at 6pm (and then there is nothing to do). There was also plenty of shade with all of the palapas (grass hut style umbrellas). There were also easy to come by. If you couldn't find shade, there were portable umbrellas that you could check out at the towel building to bring down to your chair. Excursions: we only spent one day out of the resort and went to Xel-ha. It is a great natural amusement park dedicated to water activities. It is all inclusive and you can just spend the day snorkeling a beautiful blue lagoon and relaxing at the bars and restaurants. It was a bit pricy, but you'll never see another place like it. Beach errosion: there were a lot of comments about how the beach had erroded so much and that there were unsighlty sand bags and \"beached whales\" (big break wall style sand bags in the water). It is true that they are there, but if you know anything about beaches and water, you understand their purpose and appreciate the effort that the resorts are making to rebuild their beaches after the hurricanes. The \"beached whales\" served as great play places for kids and great layout spots for adults. They absolutely did not distract from our beach experience and made for some great people watching as the waves swept them off their feet while out on the whales. There was still PLENTY of beach to relax upon and dig your feet into. A couple other tips/comments: - our mini bar was supposed to be restocked with cervecas every other day, but we had to call down twice to request that they restock it. The first day we arrived to no beer at all in our minifridge and had to call 4 times before they brought it up. - tipping: we had read that a $3 - $8 tip to your room maid at the beginning of your stay could make all the difference, but it did not do us any good. Friends that we met along the way didn't tip at all and got all sorts of extras that we did not (like chocolates on their pillows). I guess it is luck of the draw. - bring a raft or some sort of blow up floatation device. The pool was absolutely great for leisure floating around. I was so thankful that we came across this tip from another traveller. -The other great tip that i grabbed was to bring a big thermos type mug. It was great for filling with coffee in the morning to take on a walk down the beach and then it kept water and cocktails cold throughout the day. Plus, you could fit more in it than their standard glasses. I hope our review is helpful.

We are a family of 5 with kids ages 12, 15, 18. We were traveling with another family with kids ages 15 and 18. We booked our trip through Funjet. We arrived into Cancun on a Saturday around noon. It was quick deplaning and getting to our arranged transportation company. Funjet uses Lomas travel and they were easy to spot in their teal and white shirts. We only waited about 5 minutes for our van. We did ride with 2 other families and made 2 stops before our hotel. This was quick and easy though and did not add more than 5 minutes to our trip. Check in was relaxed and took about 15 minutes. They held our bags while we went to lunch, then brought them to the room when it was ready. We had 2 rooms, right next door to each other. 3rd floor, building 26. We were the closest bldg to the entertainment area. This would be a problem for anyone wanting to go to sleep before 11:30pm. Our room had a jungle view, which we loved. There is so much wildlife at this hotel- it is incredible. They did an amazing job of preserving the jungle around the buildings. The only negative is that the animals are extremely vocal and scream and squawk at all hours . The monkeys and peacocks in particular woke me every night! If this is a problem for you, request a building closer to the beach. The Food: we were hesitant to try an all inclusive resort because I had read so many bad reviews on the food and alcohol. We were completely satisfied with the food and drinks at this resort. We got to make reservations for 2 sit down restaurants. We did Japanese and Mexican. Both were good. Do note that men are required to wear long pants at the sit down restaurants!!!! The other 2 nights we ate at the large buffet restaurant. I wasn't expecting much from the buffets, but was very much surprised by the huge selection and great tasting food! We had breakfast and lunch at the same buffet. There were always tons of choices and they had a great selection for picky kids. Always chicken nuggets, pasta, pizza, chips and queso, quacamole, etc... I really enjoyed all of the grilled fish and their delicious salsas. Anyone who has trouble finding something good at this buffet is just way too picky! The staff in the restaurants could not have been more pleasant and helpful. The Rooms: Our rooms were spacious, clean and pretty. The bathrooms have marble everywhere and a nice sized shower stall with plenty of hot water. Our balcony was large enough for a table and 2 chairs with room to spare. We had read about how hard the mattresses were. I was worried about this, but needn't have been. They were firm, but comfortable. Our minibar stayed well stocked with complimentary water, beer and soft drinks. We liked being on the 3rd floor- seemed a bit more private. The Pool: this is one of the largest pools we have ever seen. As busy as the resort was, we never felt crowded or had a problem finding chairs. The pool area was kept immaculately clean. There are 2 cafes and a bar right by the pool, so food and drink were easy to come by. They also have an adult only small pool with a swim up bar. The beach is right off the pool area. A large amount of their beach was damaged by a past storm, but it is still very nice. Now it is 2 tiered and there are huge sandbags out in the ocean to keep the sand from further eroding. The ocean is incredibly beautiful here. As turquoise as turquoise can get. No problems getting beach chairs either- at any time of the day! The Star Friends- this was a highlight of our stay at this property. All Iberostar resorts have a staff of \"Star Friends\". These entertainers provide the nightly show in the lounge, entertain by day at the pool, come sit at your table at lunch, etc... They are a great group of young people who get the guests involved in activities. Take time to get to know them- they are a great bunch of people, and from lots of different countries. We miss our Star Friends already!! Remember- you get out of a vacation what you put into it- if they ask you to dance- by all means, dance! If you are asked to be in the evening show- do it, it's fun!!! The Grounds- This hotel could not have been more beautiful. Very jungle like grounds with wildlife everywhere you turned. We saw many mature male peacocks showing off for their girlfriends, dozens of monkeys, huge iguanas, swans, ducks, etc....Lots of great photo opportunities!! If you want to see the monkeys- around 5:45-6pm walk behind building 24. There is a sidewalk between those buildings and the Riu property next door. Every evening the monkeys can be found in the treeline between these two properties. The Town- the hotel is located in Playacar, which is a planned community of homes, rental properties, and hotels. It is a small area. You can walk from one end to the other in 15 minutes. The town of Playa del Carmen is a 20 min walk from the hotel. Playa has a nice shopping village with regular stores, flea market type vendors (bargain hard!), restaurants, and the ferry dock to Cozumel. In summary, we were completely satisfied with every aspect of our Funjet vacation at Iberostar Quetzal and would highly recommend it to others.

The hotel was full however our tour company was able to get us a standard room that was great for our family (2 adults & 12 year old). We were in the 2700 block that backed on to the nature reserve. Right outside on our patio, we had monkeys swinging, flamingos, peacocks etc. The only problem was how loud the peacocks are, however, we got use to it.

A lot of nature - walkways thru the \"jungle\", peacocks, swans, flamingoes, monkeys, bats, birds, capybaras (that's what the \"rodents\" are!), 2 huge tortoises. We loved the atmosphere! As for the food - just OK. The buffets had quite a variety to choose from, but after a few days it got to be a little old. Tip: The number of reservations you are allowed at the restaurants depends on how many nights you stay. We were allowed 2 reservations for our 6 night stay. However we got to eat at all 5 restaurants. Here's how: check at the reservation kiosk after 4 pm to see if they have any openings for that evening or see if you can get on the waiting list. As for the beach - it's still there and it sure beats sitting at home in front of the TV! It's a 2-tier beach, with an upper and a lower part. Yes there is a problem with erosion and the bus-sized sand bags are unsightly, but we had a blast in the water! Go to the ocean side of the sand bags, bob in the water and wait for the waves. The really big ones will wash you up onto, and sometimes completely over, the sand bags. After 2 days of watching kids (big and little) do this we gave it a try - what fun! Tip: If you want a \"real\" beach, a 5 minute walk south will get you one. Walk past the resort next door (called Sandos[?] I think) and there is no erosion problem there, and no crowds either, as there are no resorts past there. A couple of other suggestions: For $125 usd we got a private van to and from the airport for the 4 of us, pick up and drop off door to door, roundtrip. Check out CancunVans.com. Also, check out Diversity Diving if you're going to do any scuba diving. I know there's a diving outfit right on the hotel premises, but Diversity Diving is great!!

We stayed on the Quetzal side last July (2007) and next July (2008) we will stay on the Tucan side. We went with 14 other family members as a family reunion and had a wonderful time. July is one of the hottest months but we spent most of our time by the HUGE pool and ocean. There is an adult only swim-up bar off the main pool that is cool and sucluded. Our kids wanted to go in there so bad. The kids LOVED the \"Jungle\" that runs down the center of the property between the hotels. Every morning we could hear (and see) the Howler monkeys calling out to each other. It was fun for the kids (ages 6,5,& 3) to search for them... you can usually see them near the buffet restaurant in the early morning eating leaves and hanging from the trees. Other wild life includes flamingos, peacocks, tortouses, iguanas, Koi pond, mole-like animals (forget what they call them), and a cat or too. The only drawback we found during the summer months is that the restaurants were difficult to cool since they were in the jungle areas and lacked a breeze. There are a couple restaurants that were on the waters edge to visit. There are plenty of water sports to keep you busy at the resort or you can plan trips for off-site recreation. I recommend swimming with the dolphins. Wonderful. The older kids and my husband and I (37 & 40 yrs old) went on one of the bar hopping buses. We went to celebrate my neices 21st birthday. We thought we were too old but ended up having a great time. One of the bars was a foam bar. The dance floor is drowned by foam - it was fun to act like the young kids again. The buses/vans picked you up at the hotel and were very well taken care of by the chaperones. We felt very safe in downtown Playa at night. More so than Cancun. We are coming back to the resort this July (2008) because we had such a great time. I would recommend this hotel for families. July is a hot month to go but our kids only wanted to swim anyway.

We stayed at the hotel several days, But also did a day at Xcaret (very fun, including the dolphin w/ foot push experience), and a Jungle ATV/ZIP-Line/Cenote all in one trip though Discovery Jungle Park. All fun activities. As for this hotel, the grounds are lanscaped in a jungly manner, with stone trails to get you from place to place. There are many unusual animals that particularly interested our son. The staff in generally conversant in english, at least sufficient to bring you what you need, or answer simple questions, but not necessarily able to engage in a conversation. Everyone was very friendly and pleasant. Some of the activities and activity schedule could have been a bit more clear, but a quick call to the front desk or question to a \"star friend' always cleared it up. Room was normal size, bed hard as a rock as others noted. My son's \"bed\" consisted of a long cushion on a bench, but he didnt' care and slept fine. Food is buffet style and given that as a caveat, it was fine. If you are a particularly picky eater, or expect fine dining (even in the reserved restaurants) you will be disappointed. But there was always a variety of reasonably good choices that were kid friendly. There are a couple of times of day when most of the restaurants are closed --- so note that when you arrive so you aren't left temporarily hungry. Drinks are pretty watered down during the day, but you don't want to be a stumbling drunk during the day anyway. At night the shows were entertaining, got us out of our room and we laughed. This isn't broadway, just relaxing fun. Finally, when we were there, Jan 2008, the beach was getting a terrible pounding from surf which was eroding it away, several feet each day. They clearly have some repair work to do, and if you are counting on the beach in the photograph rather than sitting pool side, you will be disappointed as the beach was mostly gone.

Our room was comfortable and the buffets had a decent variety of food. Hard to get dinner reservations but three are guaranteed so keep trying. What was really dissappointing was the Kids Club. They only have one person on any given day handling however many kids of various ages that show up. Definitely do not recommend families leave young children - 4 or 5 years old - to be left here as there is limited supervision. As the children line up to go to an activity, the youngest can easily get lost - as did my child apparently since he was placed at the end of the line even though he's four. They take the kids to the adult pool for swimming - which goes from 0 to 4-5 feet pretty quickly - so make sure your children are good swimmers. My 4 year old son, and this is no exaggeration, would have easily drowned had we not stuck around to watch and jumped in when he needed help. Apparently the kiddie pool in front of the Kids Club is not really used by the Club since there is no separation of the big kids from the little kids (again, only one counselor) and the big kids don't want to be in a kiddie pool. To top it off, the Kids Club pops in a video for two hours of the 10:15am-4:15pm day, whether it's sunny or not. And the current counselor - Marisela - told me she hates her job, and never wants to have children. When we brought all of this up to the hotel, they said sorry, but did nothing about it.

The food and drinks as well as the layout of the hotel is about the same as all of the others. If anything, the food isn't quite up to par with the others I have stayed at, but it still is good. About 3/4 of the beach is gone, however the beach is still quite usable. As a matter of fact, we stayed at the beach most of the time. There are sand bags in place and the hotel has started doing construction on the beach to help with further erosion. The sandbags are a little unsightly, but a lot of people seemed to have fun swimming out to them (see pictures). The pool is nice and big, but if you want a decent chair, you'll need to put your towel out pretty early (7ish). You can get good chairs on the beach at any time. As a matter of fact, the yellow mesh chairs on the beach were much more comfortable than the hard plastic chairs with a thin cushion at the pool. There is a separate adults only pool with a swim up pool bar. The pool bar is built in to the jungle, which is kind of neat. However it does mean that there are a lot of leaves floating in the pool. Also since it is in the jungle it doesn't get much sunlight which makes it much colder than the main pool or the ocean. We ate at the Japanese, Mexican and steak restaurants. They were all pretty good... even the steak restaurant was good. At other resorts the steaks have been pretty bad, but the food we had was on par with your average steakhouse chains in the US. Not awesome, but better than expected. The Japanese was also good. The chicken and shrimp were the best. The Mexican was ok. Actually the Mexican restaurant at the Iberostar in the Dominican was better than this one. The buffet was pretty good, although they seemed to have a smaller selection than other places we stayed. Pretty much the same food you get at any Mexican resort. They did a good job of always having a place for you to find food or drinks. They had a late night buffet. The snack bar was open pretty much all day. The pool bar opened early enough and the disco stayed open late enough. You also got 4 beers in the mini-bar in the room. However, the beers were never refilled until we left a note asking for some more. Water was refilled daily. We had ocean view room (or should I say construction view). (See pictures). The view actually was pretty nice, but will be much nicer after the construction is completed. The construction workers started late in the morning and finished by 5 at night so noise was never an issue. The bed in our room was extremely hard. We have stayed at many resorts in Mexico and they all have hard beds. This one took the award though. It took a couple of nights to get used to it. The air conditioning worked fine, but it does work on a sensor so your room will get warm after you leave. This wasn't a problem except for a couple of times at night that I woke up because I was too warm. I had to wave my arms a little to get the air to come back on. I was thinking about putting something on the ceiling fan to keep the motion detector active, but we never tried that. There were plenty of animals to see. They had peacocks, flamingos, ducks, turtles, some strange rodent looking creatures and of course the monkeys. If you want to see the monkeys the best time seems to be early morning or late afternoon. They hang around the entrance to the buffet. They are either in the trees around there, or on the roof of the pathway between the buffet and the theater or on the roof of the theater. The theater is pretty nice, and well used. The shows are the same as all of the other Iberostars. Don't expect much. One last tip, if you like good Tequila, they do have Don Julio. You can occasionally get it at the theater bar... but they always had it at the Disco. You have to ask specifically for it. Overall, I cannot really recommend or not recommend this resort.

Even though we had dinners at the restaurants, we came back to the buffet for ice cream for dessert. We stayed in building 26 , which is near the entertainment center. We could hear the music until 11:30 each night. In the morning, the monkey's noise woke us up at 5:45 - 6:00 AM. The buildings closer to the ocean were quieter. The entertainment was very good for 5 nights, okay for 3 nights, and poor for 2 nights. The tours offered by Iberostar travel were much cheaper, and vans were used rather than buses. The buses made several stops before the final destination, especially Tulum. The experience with Lomas Travel was a disaster. The beach was destroyed by Hurricane Dean, but we spent most of the time at the very large pool. Drinks were included and servers were always available at the pool. Gloria at the reception desk was very helpful with information on many issues. Plus, her English was excellent, unlike some of the staff. Most of the guests seemed to be from Europe (England and Ireland) and South America, very few Americans. We are a retired couple: the pace was just right for our lifestyle. There were many families with small children. There was hotel staff to entertain the kids during the day.

It was a unique resort, and we had a very good time. Neither of us had ever been to an all-inclusive so I spent a lot of time on TripAdvisor gathering information. I was looking for a place that seemed spacious, good value for the money, an opportunity to participate in activities or not, and a place that wasn't full of drunk people that felt like a meat market. We booked hotel only through FunJet. We paid a little under $600 each and it included transportation to and from the Cancun airport. The transportation was a van filled with others going to resorts in the same area and took about 20-30 minutes. When we got to the resort we checked in, the desk clerks were very polite, and we were welcomed with a tropical punch by a waitress carrying a tray. The lobby was beautiful. It is open air with birds and a bird pool in the center. In addition to the check-in desk there is an information desk, a bar, and a few shops. As we were waiting with another party to get our keys, the clerk called me over and said they had an upgrade for us which was a room on the first floor right off of the beach. Right there we were psyched!! While we waited for our room to be ready, they held our bags for us and we enjoyed a drink at the bar. After a short time, they told us our room was ready, gave us directions, and told us our luggage would be brought to us. I am very glad about that because our room was as far as you could get from the lobby. When we arrived to our room, I immediately jumped on the bed because quite a few people had complained on here that the beds are too hard to even sleep on. From what I had read, I assumed they would feel like concrete slabs, but we both slept just fine. The airconditioning wasn't great and doesn't stay on when you leave the room. It seemed to be on sensors so it got hot through the night, too. We just kept the ceiling fan on high. It helped, but I like it very cool when I sleep so this was a bit of a bummer but not really a big deal. The shower was big, there was a weird blowdryer in there that I couldn't figure out, there was also a sitting area in front of the patio door to the balcony with two couches on either side and a coffee table. There was also a mini-fridge with water, sparkling water, pop, and beer. It was refilled each day. I even left a note for housekeeping for more water and she left us two big jugs full. The first day we walked around the interior of the resort which is jungle like with stone paths. We saw turtles, flamingos, birds, peacocks, and little furry creatures. I was on the look-out for monkeys but didn't see any. We also got a lay-out of the resort- the pool is huge- and went to the snack bar for a snack. We also made reservations for the specialty restaurants. We were able to make two, and the lady offered to try to get us a third, but we just stuck with the two so we wouldn't feel locked in to something. One night we ate at the tropical restaurant which was open air and what I found funny was it was in the snack shop. They just kind of converted it by putting up bead curtains and having waiters. The food was fine- but not super. The other restaurant we ate at was the mexican one. It was indoors with airconditioning. It was kind of half buffet, but you order your entree and they bring it to you. At the resort, we took a bike tour of PlayaCar and Playa del Carmen. It lasted a little over an hour. We also played in a Bocci tournament and played Bingo. My friend took a stretch class which she enjoyed. There were always activities but sometimes they were listed wrong which was a hassle. For example, we were going to take a dance class one afternoon but there was no one there. We asked someone and they said it alternates weeks but on our info sheet it said on Tuesdays. They also have afternoon beach parties with lots of things going on and pool games, too. We didn't participate in them though. The beach, when we were there, was gorgeous. It was hard to find chairs and there were topless women walking around. The resort seemed to cater more toward Europeans. We met some Canadians, but no other Americans. The pool is really nice, but again a hassle to find chairs. We ate breakfast every day at the buffet. It was okay. I never dreaded eating there, but it wasn't anything to brag about. I did enjoy the freshly blended pineapple juice though. We ate a snack for our lunches. They had pizza and nachos, and leftovers. Again, not super, but okay. My friend did say the guacamole was delicious and almost OD'ed from eating so much. She was in heaven. For evening entertainment we went to the lobby bar where they had a man singer with a keyboard one night and a soft music band another. It was nice because you could visit, play cards, and listen to music. They also had StarFriends performances each night. We went to one. It was music and dancing from Latin America. They really try, but it wasn't that great. Like the food, it wasn't horrible, but nothing to praise. The StarFriends are the activity and entertainment people. They are mostly young people from all over the world who work really hard to provide guests with a good time. We checked out the disco one night, but found it kind of dumpy and too loud. Guess we are too old. One day we rented a car to go to Coba and to Tulum. It was nice to get out into the real Mexico in addition to having the beautiful resort. The best of both worlds. I would return to the Quetzal again based on the price, the safety, and the beauty of the resort. I guess the only negatives may be the food, the crowds at the beach and pool, and the air conditioning in the room. Oh, I finally saw monkeys so that was super!!! I hope this helps!

What really isn't clarified to travellers is that the Iberostar Tucan & Quetzel are the same Hotel. It doesn't matter where you book...as they can switch you from one side to the other no questions asked. No worries, they are both beautiful, but it is confusing upon check-in, especially when your travel agent doesn't tell you this (Flight Centre). Unfortunatly our initial rooms were horrible (overlooking the loading docks, very loud throughout the night etc..). It took two nights to get that straightened out, and we were finally moved down by the pool. I had emailed Mario (Public Relations @ hotel) prior to departure to book our a la cartes and ask for room by the pool. The restaurantes were all reserved for us but no luck with the room. I think a lot of people ran into the same problems (and yes, the beds are hard, but you learn to live with it). The Signature Rep. at the hotel was a great help resolving our issues. The grounds of the hotel are beautiful and truly jungle like. The location is fantastic as you can walk to the Playacar for some shopping or take a $5.00 cab ride to town. The beach...well, the previous reviews tell it like it is so you won't be surprised. The pool is great, and the Star Friends work hard trying to get everyone participating. We really enjoyed spending time with them and they in turn played a big part in the overall satisfaction of our holiday. If you enjoy the games and want to participate, let them know, they will seriously hunt you down, know your name, and make sure your involved. Yes, you should reserve your pool chair as they go fast, especially if you're with a larger group of people. A note, the Steakhouse, does serve breakfast by the pool, very quiet and convenient. The food was good. We ate at the Tropical, Steak House and Japanese. The Beef was tender and just as good or better then here. The Japanese restaurant was by far the most entertaining. Day trips - We did a combination of Xel-ha/Tulum. Take my word..and do the full day at Xel-ha, we purchased the all-inclusive. Great food, drinks, and amazing snorkeling etc..None of us were ready to get back on the bus and do Tulum. Our Guide wasn't the greatest at Tulum. We should have just booked seperatly. They do have some good shopping there as well. We also did a half day trip speed boating/ATV'ing (Miramar Beach). Again, beautiful beach, but they sure do get you with the extra fees. Upon arriving we each had to pay another $8.00 for a \"reef tax\". Be prepared for the pictures afterwords too. The most classic was after Tulum, and our guide came on the bus with our group picture on a Tequila bottle (how could we not buy that?). We booked our trips through the Signature rep at the hotel and had No Problems. Our husbands booked a fishing trip through a gentleman downtown and they were a little disapointed when there were no cervesas on board.

No matter what the management say, people are still reserving sun beds. Perhaps the management could go round before 10am and any beds not occupied could leave a marker advising that unless the beds are occupied within say an hour, the belongings will be collected and taken to the towel hut for collection, that may help with people putting stuff out then not going to the pool area for hours.", "Date": "February 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cGreat time at the Quetzal, from Sheboygan, WI\u201d", "Author": "kevjods20", "ReviewID": "UR13388096", "Content": "We arrived on Jan. 25 2008 for a weeks stay.

I truly couldn't ask for more from a resort. There is a lot to appreciate here, but for me, the grounds take the cake. It was literally like living in paradise for a week! The birds/animals were so used to people that you could sit a couple feet from these exotic creatures and just enjoy them. We even got to see a mommy monkey carrying her little baby while hanging upside down in a tree! I left the hotel to go into town one evening, and I actually couldn't wait to get back because it felt so good to be there. I have to say that the staff was absolutely wonderful! Everyone was super-friendly to us, and seemed to go out of their way to make us feel welcome. Some reviewers mentioned that if you didn't tip they were rude- not true! There were times that I simply didn't have any cash on me in order to tip, and there was no difference in service. In fact, I noticed that most people did not tip, and they were nice to everyone! Also, the star friends are just adorable, and I very much enjoyed having lunch with them at the restaurant by the pool. Before I arrived, I was very concerned about the beach (based on others' reviews). Honestly, the erosion was a non issue. Sure, it's a little steep walking from the hotel to the beach level (there are stairs), but as of right now, there is plenty of beach area to enjoy, as it seems that the water has receded some. It's true there are big sandbags out there, but you know what? It's what you make of it. There were plenty of people laying on them, kids jumping off of them, having fun with them... It was actually kind of cool to sit up there in the middle of the ocean. And mind you, quetzal/tucan still has a better beach than most other hotels on that strip. Next concern was the reserving of the lounge chairs- yet another non-issue! I always found a couple chairs for us, both on the beach and pool side, at all times of day. In fact, chairs were plentiful. As for the restaurants, I ate at the steakhouse, japanese, and italian. The tenderloin at the steakhouse was great, and the japanese was yummy and fun (I skipped the sushi appetizer). I am picky with italian food, and while it was definitely edible, it wasn't very italian :) Never a problem getting a reservation, and you always have the option of stopping by the reservation counter at 4pm or later, to see if you can get in for that night. So while we were allowed 3 for our 6 night stay, we actually went 4 times. It is a definite plus if you don't mind eating at 8:30 or 9:00, because then you are pretty much guaranteed to have your pick of restaurants. As for the buffet, I don't know how people found fault with it. There is such a wide variety that you will eventually find something you like :) And the guacamole is out of this world! Yes, I know it's mexico, but we had dinner in town one night and the guacamole wasn't even half as good. I actually looked forward to being in the buffet dining room because you could sit right next to the man-made pond and watch the turtles, fish and birds while you ate. To compare Quetzal and Tucan- The front bar at Tucan was definitely more upbeat than the one at Quetzal, so we hung out more at Tucan. Oh, and they have quality alcohol, just ask by name. The drink mixes (margarita, pina colada, daiquiri, etc.) tasted odd to me, but there were plenty of other options. Quetzal seemed quieter overall, but since you can go anywhere that you please, just stay wherever you get the better rate :) I was in building 24 at Quetzal and it was lovely. We were facing a waterfall and lots of greenery. There were no birds in the area we were facing- if birds/animals are what you want, go for building 27, but beware, the flamingoes are LOUD! I would go back here in a heartbeat! If you are a nature/animal lover then this is the hotel for you. I took out my camera while on the plane home, and I actually started crying looking at the animals- I missed them already!

A nice place to hang out and have drinks before the shows. The beds are hard, nothing you can do about it.

I apologize in advance for my long winded review. My husband and I went with another couple and we are in our late twenties to mid-thirties. Everything went great and I would say that the only disappointment would be the beach but other than we don\u2019t have any complaints. The entire resort is just gorgeous and the service is fantastic! The Quetzal side where we stayed had more of a lush tropical feel to it where as the Tucan side had a Mayan ruin theme. We enjoyed the Quetzal side because of the wildlife. There were monkeys, flamingos, turtles, iguanas, parrots, birds, fish and swans. It was just amazing to look at! The waterfall outside of the Quetzal buffet was just beautiful! Check In: Went smoothly and were greeted with a nice glass of cool punch. We arrived probably about 4-5 hours before check-in time at 3:00 but it was no problem. The front desk checked us in and we were able to change into our suits and hit the food and the beach until our rooms were ready. We were starving by the time we got there so we were able to catch the tail end of breakfast and ate something light there and then ate again at lunch time. Our friends\u2019 room was ready by about 2:30 but ours was not ready until about 3:30 because they people checking out before us left late. No big deal though. We were enjoying the swim up bar by that point. Room: Our room was nice and spacious, always cleaned by early afternoon with a towel arrangement on the bed and chocolates on some days. The shower was huge, I loved that and would stand in there for a lot longer than I normally do. Our mini-bar was always stocked with extra water every day. We didn\u2019t drink anything else in room as we usually went to the lobby if we wanted a drink. The only thing that was kind of irksome about our room was that it was in building 26, which is close to the theater, and faced the inside of the resort so if we went to bed early we could hear the shows going on until usually about 11 or so. Most times it didn\u2019t matter though because we were wiped out from the sun and alcohol from the day so we would crash. Also I had a hard time sleeping in because of loud people in the hallways in the morning and because of the birds chirping. No big deal. I would rather wake up early and enjoy more time by the pool and beach. Pool/Beach: The main pool is huge! Very nicely set up in a way that there seemed to be little areas everywhere. In the center there was a hot tub but it was more of a tub with jets because it wasn\u2019t warmer than the pool. The pool was pretty deep though in some areas, I couldn\u2019t touch in most of the spots but it was fun to swim around. We never had problems finding a seat out by the pool or overlooking the ocean. Granted we were up and out by the pool every day by 9am but even on the day we arrived we didn\u2019t have a problem finding an area with four spots. If you want a spot on the beach then you might have to get there at an early time as that space is at a premium. There was also a separate activity pool for water sports, a separate pool with a swim up bar that was adults only and a small, shallow pool for kids. Like I said before the beach was a disappointment. The erosion was pretty bad on both the Quetzal side and Tucan side of the beach. The resort was working to restore it the whole week we were there and were setting up big bladders and pumping sand back onto the beach. The beaches to the North of the resort were even worse though. The beaches to the South were even starting to see some problems as well but were still in tact for the most part. You are still able to walk up and down the beach though and swim in the ocean as well so it didn\u2019t affect our trip. We usually hang by the pool but it was still really sad to see. The colors of the ocean are just amazing there though, just beautiful! Food: We thought the food was great. No complaints there. I thought that the food got better throughout the day. We ate breakfast mostly out by the beach at the restaurant on the Quetzal side. It has an abbreviated breakfast buffet that sufficed for me. Then we would eat lunch on the buffet by the Tucan side because that is where they had the grill. The hamburgers were awesome but I swear I could have survived the whole week on chips and guacamole. :) Our favorite restaurants were the reservation required restaurants. We were able to get reservations for all of them and the Italian twice. Once you are done with the reservations that you are guaranteed then you can be put on a waiting list, which we chose to do. We ate at the buffet for dinner one night and enjoyed that as well but not as much as the others. Excursions: We went on a snorkeling excursion, which was great! The reefs were just amazing to look at. The colors were just unreal. We saw a lot of fish, of course, but also got to see a lobster and a sea turtle. The boys went on a separate fishing excursion and they had an ok time with that. They caught a couple of fish but it was a really rough day out on the ocean and another passenger that went with them kept getting sick. We also went into Playa del Carmen to 5th Avenue. It was ok. I don\u2019t think I would go back there. If you want to buy souvenirs then that is the place to go but we really aren\u2019t into any of that so it didn\u2019t appeal to us. We usually don\u2019t buy much when we go on vacation. I got a massage at the resort and that was just heaven! Misc: The resort does have Wi-Fi, I think it was about $12 for a consecutive 24 hour period. Vendors come in to the resort and set up tables selling jewelry and souvenirs on the walk way between the resorts and the theaters at night during the week. Also, they sell cigars on the Tucan side in the lobby at a little table every couple of days and in a shop all the time but they were cheaper to buy on 5th Avenue in town. There was entertainment throughout the day provided by Star Friends and at night they put on a show. We saw one of the shows and it was ok but some of the stuff during the day was fun. I went to stretching one day and had a salsa lesson another day. They also had temporary henna tattoos available by the pool and a place to paint your own pottery by the pool. The walkways on the inside of the buildings were pretty rough but the walkways on the outer perimeters of the resort were smooth so we choose to take those most of the time. The walkways on the Quetzal side to the lobby, buffet and Italian restaurant were teak boards set up like a normal deck might so there were openings between each board so I didn\u2019t put my heels on during the trip at all. I didn\u2019t want them to get stuck in-between the boards and knowing me they would of! I am sure that I am leaving a bunch out but I didn\u2019t want to bore anyone too much with my already lengthy review. :) All in all we had a great time and the worst part of the trip was having to come back home! It was a really nice and relaxing week and I enjoyed every minute of it. The resort is set up in a way that you can do as little as you want or as much as you want, it is up to you to make your vacation what you want. We wouldn\u2019t go back to the resort just because we like to go to new places every time but I would recommend it to anyone else. If you are beach people though I would suggest going some place else because otherwise you might be disappointed. I gave the resort 5 out of 5 because the trip was fantastic despite the disappointment of the beach! It was a wonderful resort and a great value for the money! Also the service is just fantastic. I can\u2019t say enough great things about everyone that works there.

The Quetzal is more of a jungle setting than the Iberostar Parieso Beach we stayed at on our honeymoon. We were at the Quetzal for 7 nights. So we had the option for 3 reservations. We ate at the Japanese, the Mexican and the Italian restaurants. I would rate them in that order too. We also enjoyed the buffet. The breakfast is very, very good. Every possible breakfast item is there everyday. We mainly ate lunch by the pool. It was just so close to the pool, why walk way back to the main buffet? The dinner buffet was good, but I do agree they sometimes put alot of the same things out everynight. We went on a snorkling trip at the Iberostar Cozumel, I had a great time. My wife got tired and went back to the dock with some other travelers, but I stayed and did both reefs. On our way back, we did our shopping in Playa del Carmen before taking the taxi back to the hotel. That was our only excursion on this trip. We wanted to go to Tulum, but did not have enough time. The shows at the hotel are good, if you are not too judgmental. They are not 1st rate, but are entertaining after a day at the beach. The pool was clean and warm. The beach was clear and cooler than the pool. Which felt good because it was very hot. The ocean is amazing in this area of Mexico. It is like a rainbow of blues!

Yes, the matresses were firm, but nothing to complain about. My husband and I had a king bed and our 7 year old slept on the built in \"sofa\" and had plenty of room. Housekeeping was great with towel \"creatures\" every day. The grounds were absolutely great! We saw monkeys, peacocks, lizards etc. every day. Beautifully kept, neat as could be. We thought the whole atmosphere was beautiful! The waterfalls and pond by the main buffet had swans and ducks in it and they were so peaceful to watch. Ponds between the buffet and the lobby had large goldfish swimming and turtles sunning themselves on the rocks; they were neat to watch too. I could go on, but just know this is a really neat way that they built the resort and left the natural jungle. Food was pretty good. Definitely a lot of variety, but much was the same things day after day. I really ate too many chips with fresh guacamole and pico de gallo!!! All wait staff was excellent. We ate at three reservation only restaurants when we were there. The Mexican, OK, the Italian; fine and the Japanese; excellent. The Japanese was the highlight of the dining. The Christmas Eve buffet was excellent too with lobster, champagne, etc. The kids club, called Lucy's, was good. It was open from 10:15 a.m.-5 p.m. My daughter wanted to go every day. It was not overly busy. I was surprised that there were only maybe a dozen kids there at any time. The kids got to have their own performance like \"Cats\" in cat costumes one night in the main theatre. My daughter loved that! They also did facepainting, games in the pool and much more. On Christmas Eve afternoon, there was a beach party. They were counting down until Santa would arrive. They said he would parachute and land on the beach. Here comes the small plane and I couldn't believe it! Santa really did parachute and land on the beach!!! We will always remember that! Then every child got a gift from santa. The got \"Star Friends\" t-shirts and a bad of candy. I thought that was great. They only negative that I will mention is the whole \"save the lounge chair\" game. Every day you had to be down before 7 a.m. to get a chair poolside. Everyone else does it, so you have to too in order to get chairs. There are notices that says you can't do this, but no one in enforcing this. As others have already written, yes, the beach is eroding, but that is not Iberostar's fault. Hopefully this can be remedied. All the entertainment staff, called \"star friends,\" were so nice.

We arrived to a very friendly staff and a great guy at the check-in desk (he had everyone laughing). We had to wait an hour or so for our room which was no problem, we had lunch at the buffet and we were also greeted with a welcome drink. The resort is very lush and we loved seeing the monkeys and peacocks every day. Our room was clean and we had plenty of beverages in the in-room fridge. I am a beach person and the only downside was that you have to hit the beach by 8AM to reserve a chair (this is not a lie). We would put our towels down, go to breakfast and then hit the beach. By 10 AM you were hard pressed to find a lounge chair anywhere, even by the pools. Also, you did not have a lot of breathing room between people, which may be due to erosion and some loss of beach (I am guessing). Just get up frequently and walk along the beach till you lose the crowds of people (the beach walks were fabulous). Also, lots of kids which I did not mind. What bothered me was the parents yelling at their kids. If you a looking for a \"quiet\" resort, I would not suggest this place. The only other downside to me was the food. The buffet had the same food choices everyday...they could add a few different things now & then like other resorts we have stayed at. Also, the food was never hot, it was always barely warm. The sit-down restaurants served the same food as the buffet (at least it tasted the same). Iberostar needs to work on the food and then they will be top-notch. Last complaint would be the pools--not as clean perhaps because of the jungle setting. Leaves floating in the pools and the swim up pool bar looked kind of gross.

The property: the resort is not very large, and consists of Quetzal and Tucan parts, which share the pool, the theater but have different buffet places. The property is very well maintained, both the landscaping and the buildings are in very good shape. The rooms are nice, well above average for this type of resort. The beds are firm, but we didn't spend a minute thinking about it. Overall, I would give an excellent grade to the property for this type of resort. The beach: about 1/3 of the shoreline of the resort's beach is eroded, quite severely at places (some sand bags below the sand are fully exposed and there are large rocks exposed underwater where erosion is). Most people stay on the eroded side of the beach since it is closer to the food courts and other amenities. I recommend going a bit to the right (as you look at the sea), that area has many more available spaces to lay down and the beach is good there. The sea water was below our expectations (may be due to the season), as it was NOT transparent at all and stormy (1-3 feet ways practically every day). Overall, the beach would get a \"below average\" ranking from us, as it looks quite different from the best pictures. The food: unless you are in your swimming costume, try the main buffet place which is located next to the lobby. The food there is decent, though NOT very tasty or diverse - the choice there practically never changes. Do NOT even think about drinking water the waiters pour into your glass - I got very sick for about 2 days after sipping a tiny bit of water there. My family ate practically the same things that time and nobody else got sick, so it must be the water. Try eating well cooked food to be on the safe side! I would give the food there an average grade, nothing to be excited about. The beach food courts have limited selection and the desserts there are pathetic. The best food in those courts was plain old burger (cooked just outside of the court) - it is quite tasty and safe to eat - I had it almost every time I ate there, though I generally don't eat burgers. The restaurants (with reservations): In my opinion, one can safely skip those and not loose any good experience (unless you have no access to Japanese restaurants at your home location). We live near Boston and have a good idea about Japanese and other types of foods and how they should taste and look. The Japanese place at the resort was, well, pathetic. Again, there were some people there who seem like they've never been to a Japanese place and they liked the \"show\"; while the show (eggs making a snowman, etc.) is fine, the sushi and the food cooked there is NOT Japanese but something else. Buy prepared sushi in ANY grocery store in the US and you will have a far, far better experience with taste compared to what you'll get at the resort. The steak house: nothing to write about. Overall, we decided to stick with the main buffet place and think it was the right place to eat at this resort. The drinks: say \"no\" to their Margaritas. We are regulars at a good \"a-la Mexican\" place in Boston and know quite well how a Margarita should taste. The \"welcome drink\" I got (Margarita) tasted and looked like antifreeze (not that I ever tried it :) and I had to pretty much spit it out. My wife got some other sweet drink, it was pretty bad as well. As time at the resort went on, we discovered that you have to use trial and error (and good advise) to find good drinks and stick to them. My wife and I liked \"dirty monkey\" made with banana, Baileys-like mix and something else. A good rule of thumb: KNOW what ingredients you like in a drink (tequila, amaretto, whatever) and keep it simple - ask the bartenders to give you those on ice, that way you are guaranteed to get what you expect. If you have a preference to a specific brand (I like Bombay Sapphire gin vs. Beefeater, for example), even better. Remember, the FURTHER you are from the beach bars, the BETTER your drinks will be! The entertainment: it was above average, I highly recommend attending nightly shows at the theater, they usually start at around 9pm. Very funny at times :) The karaoke could be a nightmare if you have good ears, as some people like to advertise their \"bad ears\" too much. There were some Mexican tourists in the resort that decided to show there national pride by singing at the karaoke. 80% of the audience left, as their bad singing was unbearable. Overall, we had a pretty good experience with the resort. I would probably NOT come back there again because the beach was below my expectations and because there are a lot of other places to see and enjoy, however most people like the place.

Yes, there was some poor food at the buffet but there was some great food too. We went to the Japanese restaurant and it was excellent. We didn't move quick enough to make other reservations.

Yes, many, many inconsiderate people plopping their towels on the loungers first thing in the morning. Many times the towels were there but the people never showed up and we were there for hours. Felt bad for the elderly who couldn't find loungers. We just planted ourselves on the sand and still enjoyed it. Star friends were a bit goofy but entertaining. Santos at the bar was the best! After that bar he went to the disco. We never had to ask him for a drink all night...they would just show up. Disco was pretty good. We went snorkeling with, if I remember right, Mayan Adventures. Mario and Isidro were a lot of fun! Went snorkeling in Akumal, then to a cenote, then to a cave. Another day went to Coba, a Mayan Village, and a cenote. It was interesting. Took 3 extra hours picking and dropping people off at different hotels. The only down part of the trip was the evening we went into PDC. I've been to a couple of islands so I know the shop people can be pushy, but these people were way too much! Along with one of our excursions we received a coupon for a free meal at Charlie & Carlos.

I have followed the reviews on here for a long time and I still was not prepared for the beauty of this place. The wildlife we saw through the trip was amazing. The monkeys put on a great show for our group one day, the highlight for most of the kids and some of the adults I'm sure!

The pool is huge and kept very clean. We didn't ever have too much trouble finding loungers. The waitresses did a great job keeping drinks full. The kids really loved the ice cream by the beach. The food was very good. Not quite sure how there could possibly be complaints about it. There were so many choices no matter if you ate at the buffet or the specialty restaurants. The red snapper at the Italian restaurant was amazing, the coconut shrimp at the Mexican restaurant was another favorite. We also ate at the Tropical and the Steak house, both were excellent. Not one person in our group got sick or had any complaints about the food. About the bites some people get while on vacation, some people get them and some don't. My family has been to Mexico a few times and our daughter always gets them while we don't. Out of the 40 of us about 10 were affected by this. These 10 people were in rooms with people who were NOT getting them. We think maybe they are sand fleas, not sure. But it is not because of the resort or the cleanliness of the place.

They ended up going to the emergency room when they got home Sunday night. The man was in the hospital til Tuesday night getting IV antibiotics, the lady was treated, given antibiotics and released.

The rooms were again up to the usual standard clean, bright, petals, chocolates and animals made out of towels are a nice feature by the maids, probably could be done with the rooms updating, but still spotlessly clean. We went to most of the shows on a night time in the show bar, most of them were very entertaining but there was the odd one that was very interesting, the star friends done their best everyday to entertain everyone at the two hotels, whether it was playing games around the poolside to dancing on the stage at 10 o'clock at night and everyone of them you will never see without a smile on their faces. At the buffet restaurant the food was faultless everything tasted beautiful, the steak house was as usual spot on but my favourite speciality restaurant this year by far had to be the Japanese, food cooked right in front of you, the entertainment from the your very own chef was class, and the taste of the food was out of this world.

Never having stayed at an all-inclusive hotel before, I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food; the friendly, professional staff; and the overall quality of the facility. I have to add a couple of negatives, however. First, there is no swim-up bar at this hotel. Not the kind one would expect, anyway. There is a separate \"grotto\" pool that you enter by walking down steps separate from the swimming pool. In this grotto there are seats submerged at the bar and in separate areas around the \"pool\". Second, when an all-inclusive hotel advertises that they offer free domestic beer, it means the one single beer they have a contract with - in this case Dos Equis. If you want anything else, you have to buy it off the premises and store it in your room. I dined in three of the \"ala-carte\" restaurants that are available by reservation. Two were excellent - the Japanese Restaurant (Bonsai) and the Italian Restaurant (LaGondola). I have mixed feelings about the third (La Marimba). For some reason, unless it is an upscale chain restaurant such as Ruth's Chris, very few restaurants I have eaten at in Mexico know how to prepare a steak (Cambalache in Cancun being the shining exception). The meal I had at the steak restaurant was on a par with Sizzler in the U.S. The buffet that comes with the all-inclusive package was varied, interesting, and for the most part very good, and the desserts were outstanding. And I must praise the wait staff in the buffet - they are very attentive and friendly. The only negative person I encountered on the whole trip was one grumpy cook who was hesitant to give up much of her pork roast - which was excellent. There are two buffets at the pool which serve a variety of pretty good food - and have burgers, dogs and fries if you tire of pasta and mexican food. The hotel had a fish barbecue one day and a chicken barbecue on another that were a huge hit. The entertainment staff is very friendly and gets everyone who is interested involved in games in and out of the pool all day long. The hotel offers water sports and you can parasail, rent jet skis, go fishing, diving, or sailing for additional fees. There are several very good places in Playa Del Carmen if you tire of the hotel. La Casa de Agua at the corner of 5th Avenue and 2nd Street is outstanding; La Cueva Del Chango is interesting and the food is pretty good; Ipanema is overall pretty good as well. The coolest place I visited was a restaurant and lounge called Alux. It is located on Juarez across the highway from the main part of town. The restaurant is located in a natural cavern, has a great ambiance, good food, and is a nice experience. The night life in Playa is what you make of it, and most of the action starts around 11-12 PM. Fifth Avenue is the center of Playa Del Carmen, with several places along 12th street between 5th and 10th that are worth a look. I took in a few ball games at The End Zone on 5th avenue and it was pretty cool. They have satellite TV and the back wall of the bar is a huge screen. Pretty decent food, good beer prices, and you can sit out on the street and watch the people stroll by as you enjoy the game. The Tequilla Barrel is very popular, has buffalo wings that are pretty decent, and also has seating on the street. Having been to Cancun many, many times I found Playa to be more laid back, a little more of a European feel. It is a $5.00 cab ride from one of the hotels in Playacar to 5th Avenue, and if you are up to it you can walk it in about 15 minutes. Overall, I would recommend giving Playa a try if you are interested in a vacation on the Mexican Caribbean. The ferry dock to Cozumel is in Playa, Tulum is very close, and there are several beaches in the area that you can have to yourself if you like. If you scuba dive or snorkel there are many good dive shops in Playa who can accommodate you. The Iberostar has an excellent scuba center, offers free daily scuba in the pool, and is a PADI dive center. Max is a great guy and will tell you all you need to know to have some great dives. The last thing to add about the hotel is that you will enjoy all the wildlife that lives around it. There are several species of birds, monkeys, and little rat things that run around everywhere, which are very entertaining. I definitely found the Iberostar to be unique, interesting, and enjoyable. Oh, yes. If you are used to a pillow top bed, forget it.

I have to admit, we had a couple of reservations about Mexico (not least being the 9.5 hr flight time from England!!) When we were dropping off fellow holiday makers at their hotels actually in the resort of Playa Del Carmen, we were looking at each other and thinking 'Oh my god, where have we come?' Both Playa Del Carmen and Cancun are very obviously totally geared for tourists and the nearest I can equate them to is an extremely hot Blackpool. When we got to the Quetzal and got out, we kinda span around in the lobby thinking we must have the wrong hotel, it certainly has the 'wow' factor with the massive marble floored interior and the jungle trees everywhere, we were instantly impressed!! This continued as we went to our room, the hotel has been built incorporating the jungle rather than just demolishing it, there are monkeys, peacocks, iguanas etc wandering around (I was so impressed by the baby peacockcs on my balcony). I agree with some of what has been said about the beds, they are firm to say the least, although we didn't find this a problem in any way, the rooms were lovely and the maids did a fantastic job (we came away with loads of photos of the little towel creatures which they made every day!) The staff were amazing, they took time to come and talk to us, find out where we were from and remembered things like what we liked to drink and where we liked to sit in the restaurants. I have to mention the entertainment staff who really go out of their way to make you feel at home, there are activities every day and they come and try to get you involved without pushing too hard. They work so hard and the quality of the shows are amazing (special thanks to Adrian, Ines, Claudia, Roberto and Gabriel, you really helped make the holiday special!) The food... there is always plenty of choice (although I am a vegetarian, which as one of the entertainers said 'no meat, no fish is not normal in Mexico!'). There are a la carte restaurants (Mexican, Steak House, Japanese, Italian) as well as the Buffet restaurants and we enjoyed both the food itself and the service we received in them. The pool and beach were both impeccably clean, plenty of activities if you felt so inclined but also plenty of sun loungers if all you wanted to do was soak in the sun. We spent a lot of our holiday bobbing around in the pool and this was a great place to meet other people and make new friends. If you do go anywhere on the Yukutan peninsula, book a trip to Chichen Itza. It's a long day (3.5 hrs each way from our hotel) but the coach has full air con and cold drinks on board. You get to see the real Mexico as you go through all the little villages. It is quite sobering to see that only a few miles from there is so much luxury, people are living in wooden huts smaller than my garage! Chichen Itza itself is amazing, the guides really know their stuff and talk you through all the symbolism of the buildings themselves as well as the rituals of the ancient Maya civilisation. We also went on one of the dolphin swims for my birthday, it was expensive but wow!! This was on my list of things to do before I die and I am so glad I did. The dolphins were so gentle full of personality. The centre also had Manitees and sea lions and the day was amazing. The weather..... we went in October and it can be a little hit and miss, it's consistently warm, but when it does rain boy does it rain!! Best advice, stick with it, we had mebbe 3 days rain out of 14 but only on one of those did it rain all day, the other 2, there would be a torrential downpour for mebbe an hour and then the sun came back just as bright as it had been. Even when it does rain, the rain is warm so jump in the pool and wait for the sun to come back!! We have come away determined to go back and even if we didn't go back to Mexico, we will definitely be looking at Iberostar hotels for our future holidays.

The people that gave this hotel low marks were probably comparing it to a 4 or 5 star hotel which doesn't make a lot of sense. I'll just touch the highlights of what we liked and didn't like. We stayed at the Quetzal from 10/7 to 10/12 and overall we had a great time. My wife and I brought our three year old with us and met another couple there with there three year old. Ok so here are main points: * Restaurants and food were great. Don't know what some people were talking about about the food being bad. The two pool restaurants did have lower quality food and a smaller selection than the bigger buffet and sit down restaurants though and we did get tired of eating there. The hours were kind of weird though. They are kind of set up more like cruise line with regards to having set hours for meals. Got to the restaurants other than the pool ones and you can't go wrong. * Drinks--This one was a biggie for me. One of the reasons you pay for all-inclusive is to get your drinks and not have to worry about getting nickled and dimed to death. Three things I did not like about the drinks: 1) They were VERY watered down. You could ask for more liquor but it was a pain and hit and miss. Very annoying and obvious. 2) The drinks were poorly mixed and inconsistent. Depending upon which bar you went to and which bartender you got could mean the difference between a lemon icee and a mediocre Margarita. 3) You usually had to get your own drinks. Other resorts I have stayed at (4 or 5 star) constantly had people walking around asking you if you wanted another drink--you never even had to get up. Here you spent a good deal of time waiting in line for poorly mixed drinks. * Service was impeccable. These people really go out of there way to help wherever they can. If you throw them a few extra bucks for tips (especially you chambermaid) it goes a long way towards added service. * Grounds were awesome with all the animals and they were neatly manicured. Great pool and beach. The hotels next to us which were a higher class had their beaches destroyed by the last hurricane and hadn't taken time to rebuild them. The Quetzal beach was well kept to say the least. * Clientele was largely European. Many of them are heavy smokers and in my opinion, rude and inconsiderate. We were hanging out at the childrens' show and all these Europeans were puffing away with all these little kids around. Not to mention the topless women on the beach (many of whom should not have been, in my opinion). It really made pictures with my daughter challenging to make sure some of these people were not in the background. Thankfully they were not allowed to go topless at the pool. * The beds--This deserves its own section. These things were more than just firm. Basically a super firm mattress on a block of concrete and really small uncomfortable pillows. If you stay here I would suggest you bring your own pillow. We requested an egg crate but they were out and gave us another blanket which did not help enough. I know I stated a lot of negatives here, but for a three star hotel we were pretty happy. Mostly just the drink thing irked me. Overall I would recommend this place for families and couples.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "youngstown, ohio", "Title": "\u201cWonderful 7 days at the Quetzal 9/27-10/4\u201d", "Author": "Vintagewhine", "ReviewID": "UR10055558", "Content": "This was a \"girlfriend's\" vacation. We found a great deal out of Cleveland and decided to go for it...plus, it just happened to be on my birthday! I got in touch with Tami from Spirit of the West Travel and she got the ball rolling! DEPARTURE: We left Cleveland on USA3000 at 7:00 a.m. We had a nice flight...non stop. Got to watch a free movie on the way. We landed a little early in the new terminal. I have been to Cancun mucho times and have never seen Immigration so \"dead\"! We zipped through immigration, got our luggage, and through the Red light/Green light (I had to chuckle that they still play that game with all the upgrades in the terminal). My girlfriend had pre arranged with Tami a private transfer through Funjet as part of a birthday surprise! So, needless to say, we were on our way and at the Iberostar Quetzal by 11:00. GROUNDS: What can you say to describe this Paradise? As you walk through the beautiful open air lobby toward the buffet, there is a gorge with a lovely waterfall. There is all natural setting through the jungle with roaming peacocks, iguanas, flamingos and other birds. The monkeys are the stars of the jungle show here. Their howls sounded like a seal! Never saw one low in the trees...always swinging high in the branches. Every walk you take through the jungle holds new surprises...whether you see a different little creature or a new interesting looking tree or plant. Definitely a huge asset to this resort. POOL: Beautiful! It may be a bit crowded around the pool; the chaises are pretty much arm in arm. Being low season, I didn't really notice the towel game being played...with the exception of those nice covered sun beds around the pool. The landscaping is lush and tropical all around the pool area. The adult pool bar is separated from the main pool and looks like a tropical grotto...complete with its own waterfall. The pool area is always an active and busy place during the d ay with music and other activities going on. BEACH: Well, I am a \"beach\" person. I spend 9-5 beaching it while on vacation, so it is important to me. It is always kept clean...glasses and rubbish being collected all through the day. And the view....breathless! The color of the water in the Playacar and PDC area is the prettiest in the whole Riviera Maya area...IMHO. Turquoise blues in different shades...well, God's palette is outstanding here. The beaches in Playacar, as have been reported, have taken a beating with the hurricanes. Here at the IB*, erosion is also a problem, although not nearly as bad as the resorts North. Royal Hideaway, Allegro....really sad. My only issue is the beach is really crowded. Can't imagine how it looks in high season. Palapas are pretty close together. It is hard to move around during the day to catch the shade without trespassing on someone else's piece of real estate! If you cannot find a palapa, you can get beach umbrellas to plant in the sand closer to the water. This is a smaller resort than the others I have been to (IB* Paraiso, Palladium, Bahia). So, on this beach you are only steps away from the lunch palapa, beach bar, restrooms, pool...and our room was not far away either! It was nice knowing you did not have a long trek to wherever you needed to go to. Beautiful beach to walk too! Going South, the beach is all natural. As mentioned, there are some large rocks South that makes for great photos! FOOD: We really enjoyed the food. I know this topic is subjective...so, here is my opinion. We never did breakfast except for the Continental breakfast by the beach. Lunch time always offered pizza, pasta, chicken, salads, grilled hamburgers and hot dogs, fries and desserts. The beach bar always served several flavors of ice cream (chocolate, vanilla, oreo chocolate, mango, coconut). The pina coladas and coco locos were my drinks of choice....yummy. Dinner buffets served an array of salads, carved pork, beef, beef/chicken fajitas, vegetables, fish....pizza, pasta. I felt there was plenty variety for our 7 day stay. We ate at the Japanese, Mexican and Steak Restaurants. My favorite was the Japanese....the chef is so entertaining and the food very good. WE had a delicious rib eye at the steak restaurant, with baked potato, corn and great french fried onions. ROOMS Very nice first floor room, as we requested. We had a coffee pot and I usually had morning coffee on the patio. There was a peacock that perched on a palapa outside our room..must have been his night time spot as he was always there when I had my coffee. Room was always kept clean and gorgeous towel art every day. We had one small problem with our shower ceiling leaking...we called twice and they did come but the problem still persisted....our last night there, though, it was pretty bad....maintenance came and actually fixed the problem this time! We asked for a keyboard in the room but never got it...I suppose I could have asked again, but we just used the resort computers. Really just minor stuff. The internet in the room is just for email and instant messenger...costs $20.00 for the week. The computers in the lobby are 20 pesos for 15 minutes. We always had our water bottles stocked. Being a 4th time returnee to the IB*, we were greeted with a fruit basket and T-shirts. I sent a thank you note and found bottle of wine in the room the next night. Very nice way to treat returning guests! Little touches speak volumes! STAR FRIENDS What an amazing group of young people. So much energy...every day! I participated in the pool aerobics...30 min. of water fun. I'm sure some days they may wake up not \"feeling like it\"...but you could never tell if they are having a bad day. We saw the Vegas show, Mr. Iberostar and Hollywood. The highlight of Vegas was the Michael Jackson dancer and the River Dance number...how DO they do that?? \" Hollywood\" has so much energy and talent and special effects..all after a long day of entertaining guests in the hot humid sun. Every once in a while a Star Friend would stop and talk to us on the beach...Gabriel, Roberto, Ali and Lara...all very nice young people and great ambassadors of the IB* Quetzal. We also enjoyed the Mr. Iberostar show. A gentleman from Scotland won the title. We had the opportunity to speak with him and his wife a couple of days before they left. We are all from different countries and cultures. But here, in this place, we are all the same..just people on vacation wanting some R and R! None of us are really that much different. Also, on Wednesdays, after a late night, the Star Friends and Star Band set up on the beach for a beach party...with the same amount of energy! This is a really nice change of pace listening to live music, dancing and singing on the beach. The restaurant staff do an outstanding job setting up and serving paella and stir fry. Sure looked like a lot of work! MISC There is a paint table by the pool...I love to paint the little ceramic pieces. Here is another opportunity to become an ambassador to your country...several other ladies painting were from the UK...so nice exchanging conversation. We didn't do any off resort activities..unless you count shopping at the Playacar Plaza down the road! We had a wonderful trip!

The rooms are large enough and kept very clean, the grounds are spotless and the pool area and beach are lovely, the beach is large and at the better end of playacar as the other end of the beach has been eroded by the last hurricans. The Entertainment staff keep everyone on their toes, there are plenty of games and sports to join in with if you want to and they leave you alone if you tell them you just want to lay on the beach and read your book. The evening entertainment wasn't to everyones taste but there are other bars to go to if you dont want to watch it, and it all goes quiet by 12oclock so no trouble sleeping. This is the 3rd time we have been to Mexico and I would rate this hotel as the best yet, previously we have stayed at the Gala which is next door to the Quetzal and the Moon Palace which is closer to Cancun.

TIP: The TUCAN & the Quetzal are the SAME hotel. The difference is where you check in and what side of the property you stay on (right side Tucan , Left side Quetzal) The following is a BREAKDOWN of stay: C- : CHECK IN, we had to wait over an hour for our room, then wait again, then they gave our room away so we waited again\u2026.. they seem a little DISORGANIZED at the FRONT desk! TIP: ask for a INSIDE facing room. The outside rooms face the other hotels loading docks/dumpsters A+ : GROUNDS, the hotel was built in and around the jungle and they minimized destroying nature. There are animals all over! (Monkeys, Peacocks, Birds etc\u2026) The sidewalks are rocky and built around trees so watch where you are walking!! TIP: watch where you are walking or you will walk into a tree!!!! LOL!! A : ROOM , not the fanciest I have stayed in , but a nice Mexican theme, VERY CLEAN. The beds/pillows not that good. There is a slight musty smell, but my air purifier took care of that. The Maid makes the room FUN with towel decorations. NO BUGS. There is a Stocked refrigerator. NOTE: The bathroom sink water is NON- POTABLE (do not drink it!) .The hotel puts a gallon bottle of water in the bathroom, for you to use for brushing. We NEVER got sick! TIP: the 3rd floor (top floor) rooms are nice because they are at TREE TOP level and you can sit on balcony and watch the MONKEYS/birds! A: POOLS, clean and nice. There is a main pool, kid\u2019s pool, activities pool, and a pool for the pool bar. A: BEACH, clean BLUE water, some waves. NOTE: There are MANY Europeaners at this hotel. Topless is a common sight. TIP: If YOU are over 200LBS. (90 kilos) or over 70 years of age PLEASE do not go topless or wear a Speedo!!! A: Fitness center.

The after 11 p.m. buffet is food just left on the table, but I guess they figure if you are eating after 11 p.m. you will not care or you are probably drunk.

We didn't think we could better our previous hotel. I read most of the reviews on here before I visited, and althought the reviews were generally great, it didn't prepare me for how amazing this hotel would be. Check in: We were greeted at the hotel with non alcoholic cocktails. The reception staff were very friendly and organized. The check in was quick and informative. The lobby is breath taking, there is a fountain in the middle and parrots in the trees. Polished marble floors and ceiling fans. The bell boys took care of our bags and didn't expect a tip. they seemed very gracious to recieve one. Our room: Was very clean, with towel animals and flowers left on the bed every day. The bathroom had no bath, but I wouldn't use one anyway. There was a great walk-in shower with an abundance of clean towels. We had a great balcony with views of the sea and jungle. Food: Amazing, I don't understand how anyone could say that there wasn't enough food?! Although at the buffets the same food (practically), was there every day, there is such a wide range of food that it's impossible to try everything on one day.. therefore you could stay for 2 weeks and eat differently every day. You can make your reservations in the lobby for the restraunts in advance. TIP: If you are a vegetarian then tell them when you make the reservation, they will make a note of this and when you get to the restraunt then (like me) you will be very well catered for and the food is delicious (especially the Japense). Pools: Just brilliant, the main pool is huge with a jaccuzi in the middle. There is a seperate baby pool and seperate sports pool. There is also a seperate pool with a swim up bar. This pool was great, there were tables and stools in the water (great for hot afternoons). The beach was great although people do reserve loungers (though they're not supposed to!) The waitresses will serve you drinks and take your orders while you are on the beach... which is heaven! If you want to get away from the crowds. Then a short walk along the beach to the right of the hotel will bring you to a stunning quiet beach with rocks and quiet bays. Next time we go, we're going to go to this beach for the day and take a picnic. The staff at this hotel are second to none, so friendly and they will go out of their way to help you. Generally this hotel is just beautiful, the grounds are superb. We saw monkeys, peacocks, parrots, iguanas, turtles and flamingos. At night, the pathways are lit with lanterns and fairy lights. The walkways around the lobby on the quetzal side are wooden and built up above waterfalls and streams with swans! On the Tucan side there are lots of fountains around the marble walkways. The only problem we had was on check out, and I did want to point this out just incase anyone from the hotel reads this: We were told on check ou that we had run up over $100 of charges from chapagne, tequila, and spa tratments. We never used any of these and it would seem that someone else had been charging item to our room. When we said this wasn't us, we were made to wait for 20 mins while others were checked out first (we almost missed our airport transfer). This problem really wasn't dealt with correctly and we are still wondering if we are going to get a bill for these items! The hotel should have a better way of charging items to rooms (like swiping room cards) so that this doesn't happen. Apart from that we couldn't fault our whole holiday. And I would also like to say that the resident band in the theatre were just fantastic. My husband and I are both professional musicians and we really enjoyed listening to the band every night. The two female singers were fantastic the trumpet player was amazing. The drummer not only a great drummer... what a voice! People tended not to listen to the band that much which is a shame. And it did annoy me the way people would walk across the dancefloor right infront of them while they were playing :-( We are planning to go back to the Quetzal/ Tucan in a couple of years and will be taking our family too.

True, some experiences are so bad, most anyone would say they had a negative experience. On the other hand, I always read reviews before I book a trip, and having been to the Iberostar Tucan two years ago, I knew ahead of time what to expect, and how much validity the negative reviews held. When I judge a hotel by reviews I look at the volume of good ones versus the number of bad ones. Things that may spoil the trip for one person, may have little or no effect for another. Having said that, here's our most recent experience. In Playa Del Carmen, Iberostar has two twin hotels, the Tucan, and the Quetzal. 2 years ago we stayed at the Tucan and had a wonderful time, in fact, the best vacation we'd ever had. Why? Because the staff was friendly and always responsive, the scenery exceptional, and we enjoyed the food and local attractions such as Xacaret, an incredible huge ecological park where you can swim in a cave, snorkel in safe clear water coves, see dozens of exhibits, including a chance to swim with dolphins, and a great show at night. The two hotels, the Tucan and Quetzal share restaurants, and a really cool jungle that has monkeys, peacocks, small furry (harmless) rodents called Zereques, swans, flamingoes, iguanas, toucans, turtles, wild chickens, and other wild birds. If you stay at one hotel you have full run of the amenities in the other hotel including the buffets and gourment ala carte restaurants. The buffets have waterfalls on each side of the entries, and pretty coi fish swimming in moats around the restaurants. Our biggest worry was that this trip would not live up to our memory of the first trip - IT SURPASSED IT! I said at the beginning your vacation is what you make of it. Here are some of the complaints I have read in the negative reviews which are true, but here was our response. 1) Beds are hard - they are, but all you have to do is ask for a mattress pad. We did, and the bed was extremely comforable. I bought the same kind of pad for a bed in my house back home. 2) Pillows are like bricks - they are, but we brought some pillows of our own from home. Feather pillows will compress to 1/2 inch or less and once you take them out of your suitcases you can fluff them back to normal. 3) Some rooms are near noise, like the music from the shows at night, or the shows in the hotel next door, or some people have hear the ice machine used at night. True, but we always sleep with a \"sound machine\" back home for \"white noise\" and it fits in one of our carry on bags so we take it on all of our trips. Between the mattress pad, our own pillows, and the sound machine, the environment at night was very close to our normal sleep situation back home. No problem with the bedding or sleeping at night due to noise. 4) Non-smokers put in a smoking room - It's definitely a possibility there. We were, and they said there were no other rooms available - but they also told us if we smelled anything they'd come spray the room. We are both very sensitive to the smell of smoke and you know what? - We couldn't smell any trace of smokers inhabiting this room before us. 5) Small ant like insects in the room. I made the mistake of pouring the rest of a can of orange soda into the sink and did not properly rinse out the sink or the can. A few hours later we discovered a bunch of insects in the sink. All it took to get rid of them was to rinse them down the sink, then I poured some mouthwash into the sink and round it, and they did not return - problem solved! No biggie. 6) I've read complaints about the food in the buffet being boring, and various complaints about the Ala Carte restaurants. Here's how I feel about that. First of all, I booked this trip directly through the Funjet website and when it was offered 4 weeks ago, the price for each us of flying from St. Louis, MO, USA was about $500 each for air/hotel, all meals, and drinks for 4 nights. In my opinion that is a pretty good deal - I sure couldn't match that in the United States anywhere. Personally, we enjoyed all of the food. I only expected to be able to book 1 of their gourmet restaurants since we were just there for 4 nights. However, perhaps due to the recent hurricane (which did not hurt this area at all), and the fact that we were there during what is considered the \"rainy season\", the hotels were not crowded. When I went to make my reservations for Bonsai, the Japanese restaurant, they invited me to make more reservations. I made two more reservations at the Steak House, and the Mexican Restaurant. We had eaten at the Italian restaurant the last time we were there. Actually, if I had wanted I could have booked reservations at another ala cart restaurant for our last night there, but we decided to go to the buffet instead on our last night. The food - I'm an early riser, so I was happy to see the Marimba grill (which they turn into the Steak House at night) had some basic goodies available at 6:30 am. They had bacon, eggs, sausages, some wonderful fresh baked sweet rolls, coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice, just to name a few things. The regular buffet which had a very comprehensive offering, opened at 7:00 am and we thought the food there was very good. I had one of the chefs make me a \"made to order\" omlette. Our last night we ate at the buffet and they had a live Mariachi band, a huge ice sculputre, and special coffee with liquor available, and a roving magician. How cool is that? The first night there we ate at Bonsai, which is the Japanese restaurant where you sit at the table/grill and watch the chef prepare your food. You are offered a plate of sushi if you like, and initially chopsticks. If you need a fork, they'll bring that to you. You can choose chicken, steak, shrimp, octopus, grilled veggies, and either white or fried rice. You can have any or all of the above and as much of it as you like. We sat with a couple from NY that we had met at the pool (Cindy and Ron), and had a wonderful meal with great new friends. The next night we ate at the Steak House - it was open air, and the only \"adjustment\" we had to make was to move from the edge of the room where rain was hitting us, to a table closer to the inside - they were happy to move us, and no problem with the new table. My wife ordered steak, I ordered grilled shrimp, we both thought they were excellent. The best steak I had while on our trip was at the Mexican restaurant. I ordered beef tenderloins which were prepared with onions, greens peppers and bacon. The waiter, Salomon, had two gravy boats filled with tequilla, which he lit, and then poured a 2 foot stream of flaming tequila back and forth, (nice little show), before pouring it over my steak. It was INCREDIBLE! The presentation of the appetizers and desserts was spectacular, and one of the appetizers was coconut fried shrimp - yum!! During the meal Salamon was kind enough to take a picture of us, and then later brought out two somberors to put on us for another picture - no charge! We are not rich, but I felt he went above and beyond the call of duty and left him a $10 tip. Speaking of which, like others, we left $2 a day for Gloria, our maid and she kept us well supplied in towels and water. Another complaint we've heard about is that the mini-bar refrigerator doesn't cool the contents very well. This is true - if it's a problem you can always put your bottles/cans in the ice bucket with ice. Again, this didn't take away from our experience. Gloria left a different towel sculpture and chocolates on our bed each day. One day when she was running late we had decided to take a short afternoon nap. She called and asked if we wanted her to come back later to clean the room, and when we said, no, she asked if we needed any more towels or water? I said yes, and 5 minutes later she was there with a huge stack of towels and 4 bottles of water. I gave her $2, and left her a $10 tip the last day were were there. I also periodically tipped the bar tenders and waitresses a buck here and there. We only ended up going to one evening show, the theme of which were Broadway Shows. The female lead singer was exceptional, one of the male singers, not so much, but hey, we still enjoyed the singing, dancing, and costumes. Tip: Don't sit on the upper level near the bar - you'll hear loud talking and the blender throughout the show. I was really worried when two days after I booked this trip Hurricane Wilma headed for the Yuccatan area, but like I said, it didn't cause any visible damage. I think it did deter others from booking now, and there's always the possibility of rain. Our first day was completely sunny, the next day a little rain - on that day we took our umbrellas and walked to the small shopping plaza that is just 5 minutes away. It rained a little another day, and twice in the evenings, but there was still sunshine throughout the day. Usually on vacations I plan every minute of it with places to see, things to do. This time I promised my wife I would relax and just \"decompress\" - that's exactly what I did. I woke up before my wife, so each day I would grab my camera and walk through the jungle taking photo's of all of the animals and birds. Then I'd head for the grill to get some coffee and a sweet roll. After the wife woke we had breakfast together at the buffet. Then we loafed around the pool and sipped margaritas and had an ice cream cone. We lucked out on the room location. The first trip we were in Tucan and near the buffet. This time we were right next to the sports pool, which is near the big pool, the beach, and the open air grills. People have complained about early risers staking out chaise lounges and the covered cushioned platforms and that can be true - however, due to the smaller population, you could get to the pool as late at 10:00 am and still find plenty of available chaise lounges. We enjoyed the activity people who work during the day staging various activities and contests, and then at night they perform in the shows. Two days we borrowed some \"noodles\" after they did the morning water aerobics class, and used them to effortlessly float in the pool. The only other thing we did on this trip was take a $5 cab over to 5th Avenue to shop. We bought some t-shirts really cheap, and a few souvenirs (we collect refrigerator magnets where ever we go). Some of the shop owners are semi-aggressive, imploring you to view their shops, but they don't follow you like some have done in Cancun. They try one pitch as you pass by - my favorite was, \"Come on, give me a chance to rip you off\". In summary, we had a fantastic time on our trip to Playa Del Carmen, staying at the Iberstar Quetzal. We consider it our little \"paradise\" and will definitely come back to it again. Were things perfect? No, they never will be. But there is so much we love about this resort, their staff, and the sheer beauty of the grounds, that we roll with it. A few final observations: For familys - the beach is topless. I went down one morning and laid on a chaise lounge under a thatch umbrella and at first I was all by myself. An hour later, there were at least 5 women near me who were topless. I'm 59, and as my 49 year old wife says, \"you're never too old to look\" - so I enjoyed the view! If you have small kids and are going to the beach, just be prepared. You're best chance to see monkeys is to walk down the roadway/path on the farthest left side of Quetzal. Going from the lobby of the hotel, about halfway to the beach you'll see a group of trees on your right and left. One morning I stood underneath and took pictures of at least 8 monkeys jumping from one tree across the road to another. Money - we didn't need pesos the entire trip. What you do want to bring are single bills for tipping. Also, make sure when you shop and you're from the US, that if you only have a large bill, you will get your change in US currency. If you don't you may end up with Pesos and some of the stores do not offer a very favorable exchange rate and you'll lose money on the transaction. You'll find better prices in the 5th Avenue area, then the little shopping plaza near the hotel. T-shirts are 25% cheaper for one example. Age of guests: On this trip, the majority of people at the hotels seem to be in the 20 to 30 age range. There were just a few in the 60 and older age range from what we could tell. We were in the 40 to 60 age range, and didn't see as many folks our ages as we did the younger ones. Again, I'm not complaining - the '\"eye candy\" for this middle-aged healthy American male (you can look but don't touch) was at times spectacular. Finally, we've done all inclusive and non-inclusive. If you're find the right place, you simply cannot beat an all inclusive plan. Meals, drinks, and even room service at no extra charge? To us it makes the trip extremely affordable. The only other money we spent while we were there was on a few t-shirts, magnets, and tips.

The IB* quetzal turned out to be an excellent choice. We reserved 2 rooms and were placed in a building near the water. The rooms were good sized and were cleaned promptly every day. we saw an occaisional ant in our rooms, but we're in the jungle. I did not see any other insects the whole time we were there. The people at the front desk were very helpful and courtious except once and that was by a supervisor who obviously was out of his element and it barely leaves a blip on how the rest of the staff excelled at their jobs. The rooms as I mentioned were clean, bright and tastefully decorated. The air conditioner was almost too good. The beds as mentioned in other reviews are unnaturally hard but we lived with it. I found out later we could have pre ordered mattress liners to soften them, maybe next time. The food is fine, plenty of it, all the time. We ate at the buffet since we didn't want to be tied to a scheduled dinner reservation. My daughters ordered custom made omeletts every morning. We did eat at the mexican restaurant the first night and it was as good as any other place you may have visited, but a little more choice than the buffet. We were there to have fun and relax so the food was not a priority. The pools are fabulous. There is entertainment every nite and all the entertainers work very hard. There are scuba lessons in the pool, sailing lessons and rentals all the cool things one would expect to find at such a resort. We found it to be very family friendly and I did not for a minute worry about my girls walking alone from the lobby to our room or out to the pools. The beach is very large and quite lovely. You have to nab a spot early in the morning, but it's not a big deal, we would leave or towels and stuff on the chairs and go have lunch come back and it was as if we never left. I never worried about the security of the room we kept all valuables in the room safe. As it happens we were at the Quetzal when hurricane Dean struck. The hotel made every effort to keep the guests notified and aware of the options. We chose to ride it out in our rooms with mattresses against the windows. An interesting experience. The next day the hotel was up and running with an army of people cleaning, sweeping, rehanging things etc. The resort by the way is only a 5 minute cab ride to Playa del Carmen. Very handy.

The beach was beautiful. Make sure to take a walk down the beach about 2 miles to a more deserted area, it's breath taking. In past vacations we usually stay by the pool but on this trip I just wanted to be on the beach. The pool was big, clean and beautiful. The only draw back for me was anywhere in the pool is 5 ft deep and I am only 5 ft tall. The pool closes at 8 PM, kind of early if you ask me. We actually thought that since it was the end of August that maybe there wouldn't be AS many kids. WRONG. I am a mother and I don't mind kids, the only problem we had was that we were in a building with 3, THREE babies. Lots of crying...all hours of the night. We asked to change rooms but there wasn't anything available. We liked our building (21) because it was so close to the beach but we were on the 1st floor and had NO view. Well we did have a view of the back of what was clearly a big cleaning station. We could see trucks backing in and could hear dishes clanking all the time. Because of the above things we could not sleep much no matter what time of day it was. The jungle trails between lobby and beach were really nice. We seen alot of peacocks, rat looking things and iguanas. We seen 2 monkeys far away on the Tucan side. We asked about the monkeys and they only have them for the people to be around on Sunday and Thursday. The food was great, we had reservations every night we were there except one and that was our choice. The Japenese restaurant is just like Shoguns. We preferred the steakhouse. The buffett had so many options all the time. The rooms were just ok. The drains didn't drain properly. The sliding door to the balcony was broke in one place. We had two light bulbs go out while we were there. TV is hard to figure out and there is only a couple channels in english anyway. I had read bad things about the beds but I didn't think they were that bad. Firm, but not any worse than any other resort or hotel. I really like to have a jacuzzi tub when I'm on vacation. They don't have tubs at all. Only a few people working there were friendly. Anytime they did anything for you they stood with an expected look (I assume for a tip). I don't mind tipping but I don't want to be made to feel as if I need to everytime I turn around. Drinks were bad. No matter what I tried it was really weak. I ended up just drinking coke most the time. All in all, it was just ok. I wouldn't go back but I wouldn't say it was a bad experience either. It just wasn't for me.

Mario emailed back and stated that everything would be taken care of at check in. To my suprise when we checked in they told us that no rooms were available at the Quetzal so we were asked to go around to the Tucan side and check in there. Of course we did not get the building that we wanted, the floor that we wanted on, or any oscilating fans that we asked for. I informed the person that was checking us in of our request. She left and after about ten minutes returned with copies of the email that I had sent for the request. She then began to argue with me as she misread the email. I am not sure what her name was or I would list it. I went back to the receptionist desk several times during our stay as they were accomodating us for Hurrican Dean (which they did a fine job). There was a person named Enrique at the desk on a few occassions and everytime that I had any dealings with him he was rude and sarcastic. I have stayed at other resorts in Playa including other Iberostars. I have never felt like I wanted to jump across the counter at the reception desk and choke someone at any of the other places.

The buffet choices were diverse enough to satisfy everyone's taste. I found the food to be of good quality and taste. In fact, I was very pleasently surprised by the Italian restaurant, La Gondola. My expectations at all inclusives are never really high but I have to say that the meal at this restaurant was pretty damm good. The presentation, taste and quality of the food was more than I could have expected. I found the Japenese to be your typical \"hibachi\" style restaurant, but it was good as well as the \"steak\" restaurant. All in all, the quality of the food was a little better than average and this was unexpected. The service was very good. A single phone call to guest services was met with a pormpt reply and visit in a very timely fashion. Rooms were cleaned early every day. AC was never a problem. People complained about the \"hard\" beds. I had no problems falling asleep. Pool and beach were spotless. I suggest getting a room somewhere near the pool as this is where you'll be spending most of your time. Food and drink from the pool / beach areas was so accessible. Please tip these wonderful employees!!! I've never seen poeple work so hard and continue to maintain a smile and a good nature always. Cons: The pool has two zero deptth entry points ... one near the beach and one on the opposite side near the adult pool. The beach side entry is larger but this is where the music is playing, pool games, etc. We opted to stay on the other side. The problem is that as you enter the pool and it gradually gets deeper, it goes down to a depth of 5 feet, hardly a comfortble depth to wade in unless you're 6'5\". they could have made the pool deeper in the middle and slight less deep in areas adjacent to the various points of entries. ants!!! there were literally hundreds of these teeny ants in the room, specifically above the \"sofa\". I asked them to spray a few times and then asked for them to just leave me a can of spray whcih they did. Nuisannce? yes .. but it really wasn't a big deal. One night at around 12:45AM, I heard someone getting ice outside of our room (2231). After about 10 mins of hearing the ice continuing to drop , I looked out the peephole. I saw someone filling up bag after bag of ice. This went on for about another 5 mins when I opened the door and strongly suggested that it cease. It was a resort employee. It stopped, but happend again afew nights later. I thougt this was rather odd as I have to believe there are ICE machines at each resturant / bar etc. We did complain but we never found out what this was all about. Lastly .... there is a great deal of wild life at the resort and according to signs, all the animals are fed .. well .. all except two very skinny cats that call the Qutzel their home. We feed these poor animals and perhaps we shouldn't have but when trying to inquire with the hotel desk if they feed the cats as well, we couldn't get a straight answer. I would definately go back to Mexico, but I think my \"resort\" visits are over.

Negatives: 1) FOOD, the buffets (breakfast, lunch and dinner) are the worst I have had. I think they need to reduce variety and improve quality drastically. 2) Topless women all over the place, if topless is the way to go in your home country please keep in mind that in Mexico is not culturally acceptable. Hotels don't seem to care becuase what they want is you business but Mexican and other more traditional families may feel ofended specially when young children are around. 3) Checking-in, I took me like an hour to get a room and a bracelet. 4) Shows, don't waste your time 5) Beach and pool chairs, you need to wake up at 7am to reserve a chair, the hotel must have more available for all the guests 6) Drinks, the beer and other alcoholic beverages are of the worst quality I have had, they have slightly better brands available upon request, but if you don't ask for them they will give you the regular crap.

I booked the Quetzal because of the reviews on Trip Advisor, and also because of it's proximity to downtown Playa del Carmen. The rooms were clean and made when we requested, mini-fridge always stocked with beer, soda, and water. Breakfast and lunch buffets were very good. The dinner buffet left something to be desired, especially to my two kids, but there were plenty of choices. Keep in mind that a vast majority of the guests are European, so the choices at the buffets were quite diverse, but gave you the option to try different things. The hotel was almost at capacity, but we never had to wait in line for our meals. We had two dinner reservations, Japanese and Tropical. Both were very good. The Japanese restaurant gives you the opportunity to meet other guests. The grounds were beautifully kept as were the pool and beach. We had no problem getting chairs and umbrellas for the beach everyday. The night club, Mascara, was a lot of fun. Star Friends and all of the staff were more than accommodating, friendly, and hard working. Tipping is not required, and it appeared that most did not, but we found that after a day, they all knew us and were a little heavier on the alcohol in the drinks! Two nights, we took a $5 cab ride to town and had a blast at Senor Frogs with our kids. It's a lot of fun for older teens and young adults. Overall, I would definitely return.

The beds were hard and we were a litlle worried, but honestly, I've never slept better! I felt the food was fabulous! You did need to make reservations for certain restaraunts, but even the nights we ate in the \"open\" areas, we enjoyed it. The entertainment was unbelievable. The \"Star Friends\" are an important part of the stay. They are very friendly and work hard to get you to participate. Our party won several t-shirts from winning certain contests! The shows each evening were very entertaining and once again the \"Star Friends\" worked hard to keep us entertained. We also enjoyed seeing all the animals at the resort. It was hard to find a place by the beach or pool, but we always managed to find spots to enjoy the water. I personally loved the feel of the water in the pool because I hate cold pool water and this water was very relaxing. We found the SPA and enjoyed a sauna, as well as hot and cold tubs! We ended our stay with a much need massage at the SPA....FABULOUS! While there we snorkled (can't remember the company) and we went to see the Mayan ruins at Tulum. Of course our trip to 5th Avenue was exciting. We even got a free meal at Carlos and Charlies with our package trips to Tulum and snorkling! The entire staff was very friendly and helpful.

And, I have to say, unfortunately, the first time we have been to a resort in Playa which we were unhappy with. After much research, we decided to stay at the IB Quetzal, mainly because it has the reputation of being such a family friendly resort. Travelling with such a young child, we wanted to be sure they had areas and pools just for small children. We were not impressed. The pools are hot and almost unbearable at times (this was especially true for the kiddie pool), and unless you get up early and reserve a lounge chair by the pool or beach (which it technically not allowed) you will probably spend most of your day with no where to sit. I have never had this problem at a 4 or 5 star resort in Playa or anywhere else for that matter. Next is the food. Now, I am a picky eater. However, on our previous trips to Mexico (9 total) I have never had this much trouble finding something that seemed edible. My husband is not a picky eater at all, and he found a few things he liked, and ate the same things all week. Their breakfast and lunch buffets are the same daily, so don't expect a change. There were a couple of evenings when dinner was good. Other than that, we spent our time on 5th avenue for dinner. The rooms are large and spacious, however the beds are the hardest I have ever felt. We called and requested an egg crate pad, and truly don't think we could've made it through the week without it! It was like sleeping on a concrete bench! One more note...our power went out in our room 3 times!!!! Twice early in the morning, and once when we were getting ready for dinner. Luckily we had friends a few doors down, and we finished getting ready in their room. There is just no excuse for this at this type of resort. The only explanation I received was \"sorry\". While the property is beautiful and well maintained, it leaves much to be desired. In our experience it just isn't up to Iberostar standards, and with so many choices in the Playa/Playacar area we won't be going back here again.

Everything goes seamless and I got bumped up to First Class at no charge since I hit Elite status on Continental last week. What a sweet way to start a trip. The wife loved it. The just under 2hr flight was extremely pleasant. Cancun Customs: WOW! What a mad house. Atleast 400 people in lines. Thank god it had A/C. It took about an hour to clear customs.. Transport: We booked with funjet and transportation was included. However we could not find the Lomas travel vans. I decided the effort to search for Lomas was not worth the time and I booked a private van to IB Quetzal. I forget the name of the company but there was a desk near all the time share people. The cost was $113.00(u.s.). It was worth it. We had no stops and the driver was making great time. (about 45 minutes) Quetzal Checkin: We arrived about 4:00pm and the room was ready. It took about 30mins to check as the clerk wanted to go every little detail. I was not going to remember anything he said as we were looking to join up with the wedding party somewhere on the resort. I asked for resort bracelet, key cards, towel cards and bellhop service to my room but he insisted on giving the presentation.. Rooms: The room was clean but the resort was full and I got a smoking room. I smoke but never in a confined area. It smelled like a bar... The wife had some what of a problem with it but I explained we are on vacation. Plus we were only in the room to sleep and get clean.. The A/C did not have any adjustments on it and I think there was a motion sensor on it that turned itself on when you entered the room. Did not really cool you off and was just enough so you did not sweat. I got a wonderful wake up call every morning at 5:45am. LOL! One of the male peacocks that roam the resort roosted on the patio of the room just across the way (poor souls). He would start calling out from 5:35am to about 7:00am each morning. The bathroom shower was huge and was able to get hot water at non-peak times of the day and night. King-size bed with hard mattress. It was wonderful for my back but you will be tossing and turning if you not use to it. Beach: Nice beach as far as sand but it was extremely full. I would guess the resort beach area was and 300-400yrds wide and 100 yrds deep. Great sand lots of chairs. If you were there before noon you could get a chair. Many kids and families. Many topless women. Resort: I loved the landscape. Many creatures of all sorts. The pool was huge and you could always find an area to hang out if you have a group. You could always find something to eat or drink. This place is huge and be sure to bring comfortable shoes as you will be walking ALOT. We tried the Italian restaurant and it was fair at best. The Japanese restaurant was better and compared to the other cuisine we tried while on the resort it was the best. It reminded me of the Allegro in Cozumel with more jungle. The resorts seem to be very similar as far as layout of the buildings and feel of the place. Other: Went to 5th street the first night and found a nice restaurant called \"AGUI\" . Very nice atmosphere but not worth the money. We also found another restaurant called \"Las Parilla\" which was great on the 3rd night. It was the best meal and margarita I had while in PDC. Everyone in the group loved it. Took a day trip to one of the beach clubs called Playa Tukan, just next to Mamitas. This was a very laid back place and nice beach as well. Overall: I did not do as much activities as I normally would like due to the wedding, but I'm glad I got a chance to visit the mainland.

We LOVED it! Our room was clean and very nice, in building 2600 facing the jungle. It was a little close to the nightly entertainment ... but it was always finished by midnight and we were so tired we didn't care. From our balcony we watched monkeys, capybaras and iguanas. There was a white peacock-looking thing that slept on a gazebo by our room. He usually woke us up around 5:30 a.m. ... but we would go back to sleep and certainly added to the experience. The animal life in the jungle portion really sets this hotel apart. I will say that the stone path through the jungle to the beach is a little uneven ... so it's not a good idea to get trashed and walk it in the middle of the night (we didn't). Make sure you bring bug spray. The bed was firm ... but not rock-hard as we thought it would be. I have back problems and so I liked it, actually. The beach is one of the nicer ones of those that we saw ... but still riddled with ciggie butts. People are SO rude to leave them there. Saw a few topless women ... but hey ... this was Mexico! You will be bombarded byhe hotel photographers during the midday hours to have your pic taken with the animal of the day .... a parrot, tucan, monkey or iguana. I got one with amonkey and it turned out so cute! You don't have to buy the pic ... but do get one taken just for fun. I would highly recommend getting a poolside massage. $55 for a half-hour .... $85 for an hour. It was GREAT. Be sure to rinse off ththoroughly, though ... or you will fry yourself with the oil in your skin! The main pool is lovely. There is a hot tub in the middle. In the lobby lounge there is entertainment .... usually a classical guitarist. He is great. And the bartender makes good drinks that aren't watered down ... unlike the beach bar ... those drinks are weak. Service .... everyone is SO nice. Now for the food. It wasn't BAD .... but it wasn't GREAT. You can make do with it. Our only specialty restaurant we could get in was the Mexican one. Decent .... but nothing to write home about. The better meals are off site. We could only get reservations in one restaurant. You really have to book these before you get there.

We both absolutely loved it! We would go back in a heart beat. The beach was beautiful. From what I have heard some of the other resorts have not reconstructed their beaches but Iberostar has. One complaint I have regarding the beach was people leaving their towels on the chairs early early in the morning. We got to the beach around 10:30 everyday and were able to find chairs each day except for the last day. At 10:30 in the morning every single chair had been reserved so we had to lay out by the pool. It's really cool to be able to walk around the resort and see so many different animals and birds. There was a monkey family that we saw almost every day. The babies were adorable. The specialty restaurants were very good. We were only able to make reservations for the Mexican and Japanese (which was so yummy!). If you are put on the waiting list check back with the front desk later on in the day to make sure there werent any cancellations. If there were we found they will put you ahead of anyone else on the list. The lunch buffets were nothing special. Most people liked the food but I am a very very picky eater so I ate french fries and pizza everyday for lunch. We found that the drinks were pretty weak, but if you ask the bartender to add another shot they will do it right away and probably make your next drink stronger. The rooms were very clean. The maid does a very good job everyday. We could hear the disco from out room but it wasnt a big deal at all. It ends early and we were out almost everynight so it didnt bother us.

We paid $20 a person for round trip ferry tickets and once we arrived in Cozumel there were snorkeling \"vendors\" everywhere. We found one that was $27/person for around 3 hours.

Otherwise plenty of beach loungers for everyone! Waves were a bit strong a couple of days but water was clear and refreshing. Food: The breakfast buffet was fine. There is a large selection of foods to choose from. There's an omlette station, plenty of fresh fruits including sliced mangoes, papayas, guavas as well as pineapples plums oranges, etc. cereals, plenty of bacon, sausages hash browns as well as other non traditional american breakfast items. We had lunch by the pool (there are two restaurants on either side of the pool) This was ok. Plenty of salsa, guac, chips. Also burgers, chicken, fish, pizza, fries. Dinner buffet had a different selection every night. There were some items that were repeated throughout our stay, but overall plenty to choose from. Rooms: The rooms were fine. They were kept clean by the staff. There was cable TV, the balcony had a small table and a couple of chairs. The bathroom was spacious (large shower). Hard beds, but we didn't mind it so much. Fridge was stocked daily with water, soda and beer. We left a tip for our housekeeper every day on top of the tv with a note thanking her (Muchas gracias por su servicio) and our name.

We are used to really soft pillow top beds and these were exceptionally firm. We asked for eggcrate mattresses after the first night, which helped a little. My daughter slept on the little couch and was very comfortable. Fridge stocked daily with sodas, beer and water.

The food didn't taste bad, we just got tired of it towards the end of our stay. Room service tacos were terrific. Room service menu was a tad limited.

My husband and I traveled with our 18 year old son and 15 year old daughter. Rooms: I'd emailed ahead of time and asked for building 22 or 23 on an upper floor, preferably with an inside view. We ended up facing outside and did hear the disco but it was done every night by midnight so it really wasn't a huge deal to us and not worth changing rooms for. I'd also requested foam eggshell mattress pads for the beds, as well as a rollaway bed and all was provided as requested when we walked into our room. The beds were firm but not as hard as I was led to believe on this board. This resort, both public areas and our room, was CLEAN. Not just immaculate, but clean. I even saw our room attendent wipe down the tops and sides of the doors on one occasion. My husband came back to pick something up while she was cleaning another day and saw her scrubbing down the large tiled shower. Rooms weren't fancy but suited our needs. We tipped at the beginning and our fridge was filled daily. At times I felt like the air conditioner struggled to keep up but then again, we're not used to humidity and it was humid! Resort: The jungle area makes this resort--it has to be seen to be believed. Walking along the lit winding paths at night is a treat. We did see the monkeys--they love to congregate in trees near the buffet, especially in the morning. If you're hot and need a shot of air-conditioning, head to the computer/Internet room right off of the open-air lobby. It has a couple of couches and is the coolest place in the resort. At $2 US for 15 minutes of time, it's pretty inexpensive to check email, as well. The computers only accept pesos, which the front desk is happy to provide. The beach is perfect and only had one day with noticable erosion, when the waves were particularly high. Loved the soft white sand. We played the towel game at the beach a few times but other days were easily able to get chairs under a palapa at 8:30-9 a.m. Even if the palapas were all taken, umbrellas were available for check out at the towel shack. Chairs were always available at the beach. Don't know about the pool, as we spent very little time there. I would suggest bringing along inflatable rafts and rings from home--they're super pricey at the resort. The guys in the dive shack will inflate them for you. Food: We were not overly impressed with the Italian restaurant. It was good but nothing exciting. Loved the Japanese, though, and would have gone back. The buffets were very good but did get a little monotonous by the end of our stay. The public relations person told me that they have 'discontinued' seafood night on Thursdays, whatever that means. Maybe they just do that during the busy summer season? We ventured into Playa for dinner two nights--had fabulous meals at La Adela and La Casa del Agua. La Adela is less expensive--our bill for four people with two appetizers, main courses and drinks was $100. Friendly wait staff and a fun atmosphere--we ate at a table near the sidewalk. La Casa del Agua has some of the best food and service that we've encountered anywhere...there had to have been at least 5 people taking care of our table. The food was exquisite and their wine selection was very impressive. We all loved this restaurant, even with the $250 bill. Oh well, it's vacation! Drinks: As the last poster said, they do water the drinks down but asking for a double shot did the trick. We enjoyed the lobby bar in the Quetzal but spent most of our time at the beach bar area. No complaints about the drinks. Entertainment: The Star Friends were darling, friendly and enthusiastic. We all looked forward to the shows at night (even the kids) just because it was cheesy fun. With the entertainers' enthusiam, how could you not smile? My son went to the disco one night and found a group of young adults (a little older than he is) from Britain. They had a great time but he only wanted to go the one night. This may be the one place that Iberostar could work on--providing specific activities for the 15-18 year old set. We're from the U.S. but absolutely didn't get an anti-US vibe like the previous poster. I was surprised at how many Europeans were at the resort--even a fairly large group of guests from Russia. It was fun hearing all of the languages spoken. We found everyone to be friendly and ready to share tips and experiences if we could break the language barrier. Spa: The kids and I had massages one day--we agreed they were some of the best we've had. I included refloxology with mine and actually fell asleep, it was so relaxing. Prices were less expensive than those at US resorts. Shopping: Be ready to fend off vendors in Playa. They're very bold but funny (\"Come over and let me rip you off!\" from one guy). Prices were good but not great. My daughter bought a top from the store Bershka--evidently a trendy teen store throughout Europe. Don't miss this store if you have a teenage girl--cute clothes that are dirt cheap. The marketplace was a five minute walk from our resort and their prices were comparable to those in Playa. My favorite purchase, though? A $20 US pair of pewter salad tongs found in the resort's gift shop! Transportation: I would suggest hiring a private vehicle to get from the airport to the resort. Well worth the $80 it cost us. Otherwise you run the risk of spending a couple hours driving and dropping off folks at other resorts. We did use the free shuttle to get back to the airport and it worked fine. All told, this was a great trip and we'd absolutely go back, although probably not in the summer months when it's just too humid for these westerners. The thing I loved most about this resort?

We have stayed all over mexico and really do not think it really was 5-star. Food: the food was pretty good but they had really strict clothing rules for just the men. Even at the buffet at night men have to wear a collared shirt. My husband only brought two, as we thought he would need them for the speality rest. but he ended up needing them each night even in the buffet. so he would wear it to dinner, and then have to change as to not get it too dirty so he could use it again. The women on the other hand could wear shorts and a tank top. also men can not wear sandles at any dinners, but women can?? We felt this was a beach resort and should be alittle more casual at the buffets. Rooms: as someone else mentioned if you get a room facing the other resorts the disco's run all night and are really loud. and when you say something they tell you it is a wedding. It is not. we were lucky and got moved and the room facing the gardens was very nice. The monkeys would go by each night and we enjoyed watching them. the rooms are nothing special but clean. Drinks: they water everything down. My hubby would ask for an extra shot and they pour it right into the straw. once or twice he forgot to \"mix it in\" and drank the straight shot and he said it mostly was water. It was a shame because you are paying for these extra's of being at a 5 star . Just as mentioned my someone else, you could drink all day and not feel a thing, then go to dinner and get a galss of wine and really feel it. so you knew all the drinks but wine or beer were watered down. Pool: the pools were gorgous but you have to play the towel game everyday. We would pick which one of us would go down at 7am to put our stuff out and by 7 am most all of the lounges would be taken. we are very considerate and we only save if we know we are going right to the beach after breakfast and we are not late sleepers. We would save spot , go to breakfast and get down there and then watch for hours as taken chairs sat empty until afternoon sometimes. This got old fast as the last thing you want to do is get up early get dressed just to run to the pool. The staff does nothing about it either. Guests: The hotel really seems to cater to non-americans. We thought this makes it more fun because there is a nice mix of people. but we started noticing that they would treat them better and were sometimes rude to americans/english speaking guests. This happened alot. The food /entertainment everything seemed to cater to them and i heard staff saying what great tippers the germans were. what a shame not to give everyone a faid chance. Do not get me wrong we had a great time but we had to make it that way. It never felt comfortable we always had to really try to make it a fun vacation. this was a shame because we have been to playa several times and never felt this way before.", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cBest trip ever!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Texasgirl_Houston", "ReviewID": "UR7936348", "Content": "Oh my God!

Everyone had a great time and loved the Quetzal. The beach was great, plenty of chairs and palapas, and if you could not get a palapa, you could easily get an umbrella from the towel hut with no problem. We LOVED the jungle part of the hotel! It was nice to walk by it every day and see all the animals - monkeys, peacocks, Swans, Peking ducks, flamingoes, etc - in fact, that is why I booked this hotel because it was so different. The people that work here are such hard-working people - you never saw any of the help just sitting around, and it showed, because the hotel was very clean. The rooms were comfortable, the beds were very hard, but I'm used to it at home, so it wasn't a problem. We always came back from the beach with a very clean room and with towel art on the bed and flower petals etc. It was a nice touch. My husband and I went to the Riviera Maya for the first time in February and stayed at another hotel. The Iberostar is a MUCH better choice all around. The food was much better too. We ate at the Japanese restaurant and the Steakhouse. Both were good choices. Our kids, who are not adventurous eaters, had to be convinced that there would be more than just Sushi at the Japanese restaurant. They were pleasantly surprised. In fact, it was their favorite restaurant. Breakfast was the best at Cozumel, we thought, so we ate there every day. The buffets by the pool were OK, still better than the other hotel we stayed at, and some of the selections changed every day, which was nice. We went outside the hotel on a few 1/2 day excursions. We did the jet ski/snorkeling trip one day (my favorite), and the speedboat/ATV another day (my teenagers' favorite). My husband and daughter played beach volleyball, and we took a Catamaran out one day with a guide. (Renting a Catamaran is free unless you have a guide come with you, which we did and were glad we did.) The Star Friends are an amazing group of kids - they were always doing something or trying to get a volleyball or horseshoes game going, or exercise, yoga or dance. If you're bored at this place, it's your own fault! One more thing I liked about staying in the Riviera Maya is that there are so many Europeans that visit this area and we enjoyed meeting so many of them! They were from the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, England etc. It's nice to meet other people from other countries.

We met a lot of fun people, the beach was great, the pools and rooms were appropriate for a 3 star hotel (kind of clean but not polished), and the drinks were very good \u2013 love the bartender in the adult pool bar. I read trip advisor just about every day for two month prior to departure, and I was warned about everything I am going to say negative about the hotel. You will have a good time, however you need to email or call the hotel ahead of time to get a room facing inside the garden in buildings 2300 \u2013 2600. If you get a room facing outside of the hotel and not within this bldg range, you will hear the disco from either the Quetzal or the neighboring hotel. We stayed in bldg 2200 facing the next hotel and had to deal with the noise and music from the disco of the neighboring hotel. We could not change rooms because they were at full capacity. That was tough. Couple more notes on the room, they appeared clean at a glance. But, we had stains on our blankets, mold on the base boards in the bathroom, and cigarette holes in the curtains. We also had to spend about 20 minutes when we got back to our room killing mosquitoes. When you send an email to the hotel reserving your room facing the inside garden \u2013 ask for a non-smoking room (if you don\u2019t smoke). Also, bring you own blow dryer if you want a good blow dry. The blow dryer in the hotel is some version of a flowbee (or something) and the heat starts burning your hand after a couple of minutes. We were not in our room hardly at all, but I do need a good nights rest occasionally. So bring ear plugs. The food will keep you alive. I am not a picky eater, but it was the same thing every day. I think the entr\u00e9e was different\u2026.I hooked myself up with the fajita bar when we ate at the buffet.

This is the first time staying at this resort. We have stayed at the Gran Portal Real in the past. I have to say that this resort was great. We have two children, 11 and 15 that went. The 15 year old stayed busy the whole time. There was so much for him to do with the activities and meeting other teenagers. He spent a lot of time at the ocean boogie boarding and body surfing. The waves were great. The 11 year old spent her time between the pool and the ocean and ice cream. She kept busy with the activities and meeting other girls from other countries. We were in building 23 facing inside. It was a little slowin getting checked in, but the day we arrived it was raining. So we checked out the grounds. We saw the monkeys, peacocks, flamingos and what I call a mexican rabbit. The jungle atmosphere is so nice. The hotel is just blended into the tropical feel. The room was nice and clean the beds hard but we expected that. The air worked great and plenty of room for 4. The beach is eroded a little bit, not too bad compared to up the beach from us. Plenty of lounge chairs at the beach and pool. We played the towel game only one day. The rest of the days no problem. The hotel was filled but it didn't feel like it. The pool is huge. They did cooking on the beach, grouper and ribs while we were there. The food was wonderful. I had read that it was always the same at the buffet. Not true. You had your basics but the main course was always different. More food than you can imagine. We ate at the Mexican, Steakhouse and Italian Restaurants. I had the best lamb chops at the Italian Restaurant and Beef Tenderloin at the steakhouse. Made our reservations through e-mail before we left. The star Friends were a lot of fun kept us entertained. Went to some of the shows. Some were long and boring others very entertaining. Especially the pre-shows at around 9pm. They were fun. Went one only one excursion to xel-ha. Went on a sunday not busy did the all inclusive tour. We are planning our next trip back in two years. The tucan side is just as nice, more water than jungle. They keep the grounds really clean, always someone sweeping, mopping or painting. The resort is about 12 years old. Close to Playa del Carmen, $5 taxi ride and a 10min. walk to Playacar.

This is the single most awesome website for travel. We just returned May 10. Overall it was a great resort especially for children. We traveled with our 6yr. old daughter. This hotel is definately a must for children. But don't get me wrong there were many adults without children there as well. Plenty for the children to do. There is a kids club from 10-5 and daily activities. The hotel staff definately gets everyone involved in their daily activities Food and drinks: I know alot of people have different views of the food and drinks at this resort. My only complaint was that the buffet was really blah after the first couple of days. The drinks were really weak as well. I noticed many times that the bartenders would barley pour any liquor in the drinks we ordered especially down by the beach. I noticed this after a full day of drinking from 9 am - 6 pm. I was barley buzzed. I must of had 20 drinks. The solution is to find the right bartenders and tip them. I had to ask for Jose Cuervo tequila. They had it hidden out of sight. They mainly use only bottom shelf liquors. The beer is not Dos Eques down by the pool. The bartender told me it was another mexican beer that almost tasted the same. It wasn't bad at all. This hotel definately doesn't put their money into the drinks and food. But you are not paying Ritz Carlton prices either. Other than those little complaints the hotel was wonderful Service: The service is by far the best I have seen. When I checked into my room I put the fan on and it was shaking really bad. I called the front desk and it was fixed in minutes. Room service takes about 20-30 minutes. Service at the hotel restaurants was great as well. Beach and pool: The beach is by far better than any around. We walked north of our hotel and really appreciated the hotel and beach we were at. I noticed others from different resorts walking by and smiling at our resort as they passed. It seemed to be the nicest resort around. There were waves for the first couple of days. Bring tubes, rafts, and sunscreen. The pool closes at 7:30 pm Transportation: I didn't see alot of info on here about transport from the airport. We decided to risk it and get a cab from airport to the resort. I remembered someone writing to exit the airport and get a cab for cheaper prices. That was difficult since they lie to you inside the airport. Before we could get to the exit doors many so called cab companies would stop you and tell you their prices 85.00 USD apprx. for a cab or a van with other stops apprx. 25.00 per person USD (one way only) I told them no way and that I was going outside for a better price. One cab company told that there was no cab drivers at all outside. They all seemed dissappointed when we rejected them. We finally made it outside the airport and were swarmed by cab drivers. They were all over just like paparazzi. We finally found some cab driver for $62 USD. It was about 50 min. cab ride. When we got to our hotel they told me it was $40 USD from there to the airport. That 's what I paid to return to the airport our last day. You can also book transportation online. You can't go wrong at this hotel and I apologize for such a long review, but sure hope this helps someone. Also bring lots of $1 bills as everyone else writes on this website and plenty of snacks for your room especially if you have children.

Location: IB Quetzal is a 45 minute drive north of Xel-Ha (highly recommend), a 5 min. and $5 taxi ride to 5th Ave. downtown Playa and ferry to Cozumel. Approx. 50 min. from Cancun airport. Hotel grounds: Set back from the main road in acres of lush habitat filled with natural plants and animals. The iguana are as common as tree squirrels, several families of monkies thrive in the tall trees, peacocks are abundant, and much more wild life. I won't give it all away and ruin the surprises. Food: Abundant, delicious, and fresh. I may starve now that I'm back home because i quickly grew accustomed to the wonderful food, Don't pay attention to those that report about less desirable food- it's just not true. I speak with authority because I love to eat and I don't mean pizza and burgers- I'm no snob except when it comes to food.

Hotel and grounds - The rooms were clean and tidy and the staff did a great job. We had a different towel art everyday. The grounds where fantastic. We saw monkeys, peacocks, iguanas etc everyday. The swimming pools were all great and there were loads of activities to do for all ages. If you didnt fancy them the adults only pool bar was great fun. The food was fantastic too. We where only entitled to 5 al a carte meals but ate there for 10 nights out of 14 as the staff always tried to accomodate if there where vacancies. Make sure you do down to the booking desk or ring up on the day as we got a few cancellations that way. Trips - We did the dolphin discovery, xcaret and scuba diving trips. Both where brilliant and highly recommendable. We also travelled into nearby playa car which is great for nights out particularly the blue parrot beach bar and senior frogs. If you get tired of hotel food there are some lovely restaurants as well and really resonably priced. We ventured out to Cancun to Coco Bongos night club which is a must aswell! Entertainment - The star friends at the hotel where all fantastic especially with the younger members of our group. Most of the shows where good especially Michael Jackson! Our Wedding - The wedding itself was like a fairytale. It truly was beautiful and the staff made it particularly special. Mariela was our wedding co-ordinator. We met with her the day after we arrived and talked through everything we wanted. You can choose between a mexican or traditional white theme. We choose the white theme as this looked beautiful from other weddings we saw. We picked white roses as the flowers for myself and the bridesmaid. This was quite expensive as we had to pay to upgrade but it was well worth it. We had the wedding on the beach and had the mariachi band playing as we walked down the aisle. The service lasted about 15 mins. We had all our photos on the beach and we then had a cocktail reception in the jungle with a solo guitarist playing. We had our wedding meal in the Italian restaurant. We were so pleased we picked this as it was so beautifully decorated by Mariela and her staff. We took our own table decorations over and the staff decorated all the venues which looked gorgeous. The food was fantastic too. After this we hired the club house which is like an outside terrace. We did the cake cutting and had our first dance here. We chose the vanilla and strawberry sponge cake which was 2 tier and had fresh roses on top. It was delicious. Overall the wedding was beautiful.

They also left a fruit basket with a happy birthday card. The room was very clean and our mini-bar was always fully stocked. We did use the safe, but a few times left the camera and some pesos out in the open. Nothing was ever touched except the $1 or so I'd leave on the bed. Beach: Awesome! We never had any problems finding chairs, no matter what time of day we went. The water is absolutely gorgeous! Just a short walk south is a stretch of \"deserted\" beach, great for a little seclusion. Walk a little further, and you'll find a nude beach, or so my mom told me (I didn't ask :)). Pool: Huge! Very nice, but the water gets a little warm later in the day.

We were more impressed with the breakfast buffet and omelette bar. I will say they seem to do a good job trying to accomadate the many different cultures/tastes that visit the hotel. We got dinner reservations 6 of the 7 nights, so I can't really comment on the dinner buffet. The specialty restaurants were okay, but I always felt very rushed to get in, and get out. The Italian appetizer bar was incredible, no need for an entree... Not impressed at all with Uxmal, the carribean place. Activities: Great if you are into group things and kind of hooky/cheesy stuff. We aren't and I got the feeling my boyfriend got bored a lot. He's not one to lounge on the beach all day, unlike me. We did a couple excursions on our own, they seem very over-priced through the agents there. Highly recommend a trip to Cozumel.

The beach is still great even though some of the resorts north of the Quetzal have lost their beaches. The jungle has grown back after hurricane Wilma and is even more lush than last year. The rooms even have irons and ironing boards in them. I don't iron on holidays, but it's nice that they are there if you need them. We had requested ahead of time to stay in building 24 facing the jungle and to have rooms side by side and they did that for us no problem. The only complaint that I have is that they need more umbrellas. Everyone saves chairs by the pool and on the beach. Last year this wasn't problem for us because if all the palapas were gone by the time we arrived we just got an umbrella from the towel hut. This year they ran out of the umbrellas as well. You really need some kind of shade as the sun is very strong for our winter white Canadian skin. So if you want some kind of shade you have to get up early, or take your umbrella back to your room with you. But other than that small problem it was great vacation.", "Date": "April 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "minneapolis", "Title": "\u201cQuetzal was beautiful!\u201d", "Author": "troythetraveler", "ReviewID": "UR7428430", "Content": "A group of 17 stayed at the Quetzal March 31-April 7, 9 adults, 7 teenagers and a 12 yr old. A GREAT time was had by all! It was a 45 minute shuttle ride (with beer!) from the Cancun airport. I emailed the hotel 2 weeks before our arrival and requested a map of the property, so we could see which building we wanted, and to get familiar with the property. There is only 1 building that is beach front, and the rest of the buildings go straight back. The Quetzal is on one side and the Tucan is on the other, and the pools and restaurants are in between. There are 10 buildings that are 3 levels high, with 10 rooms on each floor. We requested and got building #24, close to everything. Very nice rooms and all have patios. Bright colors, tile floor,stocked fridge, bed were a little hard. Great bathroom. We were on 3rd floor with a thatched roof, and every day the monkeys would swing from the trees onto our roof and onto our patio. Lots of wildlife to watch. One morning, a monkey was very loud screeching in the trees. The beach was fabulous, you can go south for a long walk, but not north. The hotel to the north had a decent beach, but beyond them, the hurricane has taken its toll and you cannot walk the beach. we were very fortunate for a great beach. Tons of chairs at beach, chairs fill up early at the pool. Food was okay, buffet does tend to be the same, you MUST go to the restaurants in the evening for the GOOD food! I emailed ahead and made our reservations before we went. The Japanese restaurant, El Bonsai was the BEST! Our whole group loved it! All 17 of us around the chop-chop table! We also went to La Marimba, the steak place, The Uxmal, the seafood place, and La Hacienda, the mexican place. All were good. Every evening at 9:30 the staff puts on a show. Good entertainment and getting the crowd involved. During the day they have pool aerobics, volleyball, a bikini contest, yoga, lots of activities you can choose to participate or not! It is 2 miles to downtown Playa Del Carmen, a $5 cab ride. 4 people to a taxi. One day we took the ferry over to Cozumel, $22 per person, and a 35 min. ride. We went to the Iberostar there, snorkeled and hung out there for a day, renting a van. We drove the island and the kids enjoyed some new scenery. Enjoyed every minute of the trip, only problem we had was on the last day we checked out and our Visa was frozen, didn't find out anything till we got home with a message on our machine to call Visa, someone had gone online with our VIsa #, trying to make purchases. Luckily they had stopped it, we think it may have been when we used it for the rental car in Coz, but we can't be sure. We have gone to Mexico 6 times and had 2 problems with our Visa, so from now on its cash all the way, and bring 2 different credit cards with when you travel in case something happens to one of them!

Let me say that we made a very good choice based on the group we were travelling with. We stayed at the resort from April 9-16 we a group of 6 people (2 grandparents, myself and my husband and our 2 year old and my brother and sister-in-law (who is seven months pregnant). The check in was good and the resort is really nice for families and especially younger children. My son loved the peacocks that roamed the resort and the different variety of other birds. We also saw several monkeys hanging from the trees on many occasions. The rooms were not as luxurious as some other resorts we have stayed at when it was just me and my husband, but overall were very clean and large enough for everyone. We lucked out having actually received a true king size bed in our room that comfortably slept the 2 of us and our son. We did ask for a mattres pad however, since we did find the bed quite hard. This helped a little bit. I wouldn't recommend using their cribs if you have little ones, only because the mattress they use in them is literally paper thin with just a wood bottom. I imagine this would be very uncomfortable for a young child. Pools: the large pool that was for everyone was very nice. My son played at the entry to the pool and had a great time. There is a kiddie wading pool, but it didn't seem that clean and they have used these very slippery tiles to build it, which is pretty to look at but very slippery for small feet. There was never usually an issue to find shaded areas and loungers around the pool side, but we always had a spot picked by early morning. Also, the resort did not appear to be full this week. Beach: was absolutely great. I have been to seven mile beach in Negril in 2002 and this was the closest I have seen any other beach compare to it. It was white sand, quite large and went down to clear turquoise waters. Shaded loungers and palapas were hard to find in the afternoon, but go in the morning and no problem. The waves were quite strong on a few of the days that we were there, but were great fun for the adults to play in. My son also enjoyed the water on a couple of calmer days. This was the reason we picked this resort and were not disappointed. The beaches to all of the other resorts to our left, RIU Palace Mexico, RIU Palace Playacar, and all of the rest have literally no beaches left. It appears that when they built these resorts they made man-made beaches but ocean has taken back the land. Food: Buffet was just so-so, about what I had expected from everyone else's reviews. They had a large selection, but none of it was very impressive or tasty. We dined in all of the a la carte restaurants though and found that this food did taste better. I would definitely recommend the steak house. It's not as good as a typical steak house such as the Keg, but all in all there are many choices and it tasted pretty good. One thing that bothered us about the reservation system though was that they would only seat half of the restaurant. We were able to book all of our spots on the first day that we arrived, but on the second evening we were told that there were no reservations. We asked if we could go to one of them and wait the 15 min to see if another group did not show up (they tell you your spot will only be held for 15mins when you make a reservation) but the guest services told us \"Well you can try but I dobut they will seat you anyways.\" It seems like they don't want to staff these restaurants and force you to eat in buffet. I realize they have different seatings 6:30 or 7:00 and then 8:30 or 9:00 but I am saying that even when these seatings had passed you could walk in to any a la carte place and they would be less than 1/2 full. The night that we were at the steak house the maitre'd told us we could come any night and basically as long as we tipped him, we could have a seat at any time of the night. Word of caution, they charge high rates to use the phones in your room and even at the pay phone they want to charge you $5.00 US to make a call with a calling card that you purchase locally. Internet access is the same way. I would definitely recommend walking down the street 5 minutes to the little shopping plaza and buying a phone card there. It will work on any of the public phones there. Also, there are stores with internet access which charge about $1.50 for 15 minutes of internet use. Also, this resort is in a gated community which is very safe. We would take walks down to the shopping centre at night after dinner with my little one and felt completely secure. You can actually walk into Playa del Carmen if you want to, it would take about 20 mins at a leisurely pace. The shows were OK and the drinks were good too. You could always have your daiquiris made with back shelf rums. The ice cream parlour at the beach was good too. I used room service a couple of times when my son was napping and the food is basic, (hamburgers, pizza, chicken nuggets) but arrived quickly and hot. Would I stay here again? With my family probably, as a couple no.

I stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal October 18-23 2006 for a diving trip with my cousin, who I met at the hotel. We each travelled alone without our wives or children. I booked through Funjet, and he just showed up at the hotel and got a room on the day of arrival. The hotel is very beautiful, and the grounds are larger than it appears in the photos. The jungle in the center of the facility is amazing. After a quick check in, the front desk had a porter give my luggage and I a ride to the room. As I had requested through an email with the resort, I was given a room facing the pool (the activities pool.) Room was spacious with a sitting area, balcony with towel rack, fridge, and safe. Bed is hard, but I slept fine without extra padding. Maid service was great, and I tipped $2-$4 a day. After requesting extra water for fridge, it was filled the remainder of the stay. I used the in roof safe for cash and electronics, but on several occasions forgot and left items laying out without any problems. Dressel Diving is located on the property, and they were great. They handle all the watersports for the resort. Bought a package of dives, and the Cozumel trip which I highly recommend. Master diver's were knowledgeable and fun. In addition, a cameraperson goes on most dives, and produces a quality DVD of the dive(s) which was great (my kids love watching it.) Since I was without the kids, don't know too much about kid's program, but it didn't look too great. Small \"pool\" in front of a small building off from the main pool. Families seemed to hang out mostly in the shallow areas of the main pool, and looked to be having fun. One drawback was the food. I am not a picky person and have stayed at AIs before, and know that food is never mind blowing on buffets. That said, the food was below average, and there really aren't any desserts to speak of. Late night there is essentially no food, maybe chips and cheese. However, I didn't eat at any of the reservation eateries, which I heard were much better. I was always able to find something even if just a hamburger. After first or second night, we ate dinners in Playa. There are several great places to eat on Fifth. Overall, I would recommend this hotel because of the great beach, beautiful grounds and on site dive shop. I would return to this property again, but in May my wife and I are staying at the Riu Palace Riveira Palace to give it a try.

In fact, my husband made good friends with \"Raoul\" at the beach bar who helped us frequently! My children and parents, who had distinctly different needs, all had a wonderful time. The kids enjoyed the kids shows, the Star Friends, the pools, the beach and of course the incredibly array of wildlife. I've lived in Hawaii, and seen great hotels there, but this was almost unsurpassed in beauty and upkeep. As for any specifics, given our kids, we ate mostly at the buffet which had great options for us all. I did tire of some of the evening choices, but we did get to two of the specialty restaurants (Mexican and Steahhouse) which I would definitely recommend. We also had a great babysitter one night from the hotel which was a nice option to have. The beds were as hard as promised and the pillows weren't great. But, the rooms overall are beautiful and we had no problem sleeping. We were in the 2500 building rooms, basically in-between the lobby and the beach. (There is a lot of walking between the beach and restaurants) All of our requests were taken care of (crib, restaurant reservations, adjoining rooms in area not close to the disco, and babysitter) so we had a relaxing time. We went into town once, and without kids, would definitely suggest.

I'd e-mailed the resort two weeks before our stay and requested three adjacent rooms on the Quetzal side, centrally located and overlooking the jungle. We got exactly what we wanted - building 24 on the 3rd floor overlooking a small waterfall. There are signs posted telling you not to feed the monkeys. Obey these signs! We did feed the monkeys with fruit from our welcome fruit basket (the kids couldn't resist the temptation!). It was cute to see the monkeys up close, but for the next two days we couldn't set foot on our balcony without being pestered by the big male, who would then sit on the railing staring into our room - a bit intimidating! They also left \"surprises\" on the balcony floor! The rooms were nice and clean - we tipped the maid $1each day and she usually left a towel sculpture. The mini-bar was re-stocked every day. Always plenty of hot water. I did go down to the pool around 6:45 am to get a spot around the pool, because the kids liked the big huts. There were, however, still plenty of seats left at 10:00 am. I think the beach palapas were all taken by 8:00 am. We usually had breakfast at the pool restaurant on the Quetzal side, which really had everything we'd choose at the main buffet, including probably the best cappuccino. We ate at the Japanese, Steak, Italian and Caribbean - all were good. The buffet, we thought, was really good. The wine was also OK, compared to other resorts. The waitresses came around the pool all day offering drinks, which was nice. The staff really do make the resort - they all went out of their way to make you feel welcome. The boy who cleaned up around the pool was great - he never stopped working. The Star Friends also did a great job of trying to involve everyone. We were determined to do some sightseeing this time (our 4th trip to the Mayan Riviera) but the resort was so nice, we didn't want to leave it! We did rent jet-skis and went parasailing - great fun.

We chose this place due to the huge amount of positive reviews on Trip Advisor. I thought I'd add my own. The place itself is beautiful! Surrounded by lush forests and on an amazing beach with powdery white sands and turquoise seas! The journey from the airport was mildly amusing. We had various drop off's at other hotels, and upon driving up to the entrance of the Moon Palace my wife was bordering on tears at how stunning the Moon Palace was, wishing we were booked in there! I assured her that our hotel would be just as nice, and hoped I was right. When we arrived at the Quetzal, my fears disappeared! The first thing we did was walk the grounds and my wife really was welling up now at how beautiful it was! Our hotel choice seemed to be perfect. The Hotel itself is great, really well maintained and there are staff members cleaning, gardening and kepping the place spot on. The staff went to amazing lengths to make the stay perfect. The Hotel is divided into two halves ,the Quetzal and the Toucan. My biggest bit of advice would be to book into the Quetzal, here is why! They are only divided to give two lobby areas, to provide each half with their own lobby to improve service. For some bizarre reason the Toucan is rated slightly higher than the Quetzal. While we were there we met another couple and spent a lot of time together. We were Quetal and they were Toucan. The two halves are identical, the rooms are identical, the service is identical and the set up is identical. In a nutshell, there is no difference other than this.......the Quetzal is cheaper, great! Weather- Getting back to the holiday, we went Aug 21st-Sept 5th and the weather ok. The first few days were relly cloudy and mostly rainy, we were gutted. I think we were just unlucky though because as of the 3rd day onwards the weather was great! Patchy cloud occasionally and one or two quick showers but plenty of sun and super hot! A few months earlier and the weather would have been perfect! Rooms- The rooms were good enough, not hugely romantic but they were large, well maintained with sky, mini fridge and a good bathroom! And yes the beds were hard, but nothing worth worrying over! Pools and Grounds- Huge pools, beautiful grounds and well designed. Best part.....POOL BAR! Oh how enjoyed sitting in there sipping beers and cocktails from 3pm onwards! Food- Good! We love our food and enjoy good food, but we're no snobs all the same. The a la cartes served really good food, it was just a shame you were restricted to so many visits. Although if you had used up your reservations but they had spare places then you could book in again and again! The buffets offered a MASSIVE variety, don't believe anyone that says otherwise. Sure, it wasn't 5 star gourmet cuisine, but there was some terrific food to go with the ok food. You'll certainly find something you like and never go hungry! Also during the day there is an outdoor BBQ that does meat and fish, it's great! As for drinks. Decent beer, top cocktails and they certainly aren't shy wtih measures! Activities- Plenty to do. Watersports, games, shows, sports all sorts. There is an actual night club on site that is really good. Just like any proper night club you'd find back home. And if you fancy it there is 5th avenue just down the road. 3 minutes tops in a cab and costs 50 pesos (next to nothing). There are loads of shops there and things to see. There are also loads of bars and restuarants if you want to spare a bit extra cash, we did and it was a nice change! Suitable for- Anyone really. We are in our mid-twenties and it had everything we needed. But there were all sorts of poeple there. Families, coulples, honeymooners, groups and others! Personally I think it was suitable for everyone. This place isn't perfect, but for any minor fualts you can pick at there are an abundance of positives. Book it!

We booked with signature vacations...got a price at ---.com and then took the price to our travel agent and she honored it! We flew with canjet, which is sooo much friendlier than air canada and cheaper too. Our fav is west-jet, but this company does not go into this area. Our flight took off at 6:30 am Halifax time. It was supposed to take 4.5 hours, but ended up taking 9 hours as we did not take off in time and then had to go into florida to re-fuel becasue of strong head winds. We landed at Cancun airport at 2:30pm (which is 2 hours behind our time). We found our luggage and looked for signature reps....You look for them....they don't look for you, so if you hang about looking for someone with a sign in the luggage area, you won't find them...just walk through security and the mass of people trying to sell you time-shares and find the sign:) We were taken to a spot to wait for 6 more people to fill the van. This took about 30 minutes....time for a cold cervasa! We then were shuttled to our hotel...stopping at other resorts to drop other couples off...Took about an hour and 15 min. in total...40 min. drive without wait....if you are wondering. the resort was beautiful upon arrival....soooo clean and tropical. We were ushered to the tucan side. We did not know which side we were staying on, did not matter, one lobby books for both sides. I had asked ahead for a specific room ....king bed....in blocks 21, 22 or 23, facing inside resort as we read here...so not to hear noise from Riu beside us. the resort wrote back....no problem with king bed and inside property...they would try, but getting a room in these blocks may prove difficult ...but they would \"try\"...we did this 6 months in advance and then every month wrote again...getting to \"know\" them :) We were told \"no king beds, no inside rooms and in block 27! I stayed at the front desk and told them we needed the king bed, did not care where, just needed a king....we were on vacation \"without\" the 4 kids! they were not very friendly about it all. Oh well, brought my letters and insisted. We got a king in block 22 facing outside. fine with us! could not hear much from Riu beside us...we were too tired to pay much attention to it at night:) We could not get into our room for about 45 min. as the key did not work. Hubby went back to the front desk and got another and it too did not work....we got a bellman to go to the front desk and this key did not work...finally they called someone from security and a locksmith had to change something in the lock. No ones fault really ....just one of these things. Once we got inside, we had a towel swan and chocolates. Pretty room on the quetzal side...the only difference between this and tucan are the colours of the bedspreads and drapes. It was a nice size, not huge but nice. Every room has a balcony or terrace....we were on the second floor. Has two plastic chairs and table outside and drying rack. the bathroom was all marble and had shower only. very clean though, which is important to us. shampoo and hairdryers and lotions were provided. There were all kinds of room to hang clothing and shelving inside of cupboards. Also safe to put valuables. there are three areas to store luggage and a cubby hole to put more clothing. the sofa area also had table and chair. T.v. was internet friendly...have to pay fee and had pay movies as well as other movies etc. The bed was hard. Was so tired at end of day, did not matter. Was so clean. I have a hip problem (broke it 5 years ago) and back issue, I was not sore except for one morning. Beds were fine. Mini-fridge was stocked with large bottle of water and 4 other bottles of water, soda water, orange soda and cola and beer. We were very close to the pool and ocean, could partially see ocean on balcony ...room 2226. We were not far from lobby area and buffet area for breakfast...two minute walk on outside of property or 5 minute walk through jungle....gorgeous....saw flamingos, some groundhog crature, parrots, monkeys (yes saw them a few times...made our day:)) , peacocks, iguanas, and other creatures...so beautiful, never ever tired of it. They work so hard at this resort to keep it beautiful here. Plant life is amazing here. Buffets were wonderful and everyone was very friendly. Breakfast ran from 7am to 10 am (and slightly before this and after this). You have omlette and egg station...including hard boiled eggs and fresh omlettes are made on the spot for you. There is always tons of bacon and sausages...yummy. there is another grill doing pancakes and the like. A sanwich area...ham and cheese etc.and there are Mexican dishes as well. There is a sweet station...yogert station, cereal area, bread area, salad area, and on and on. If you can't find something here....well, I won't go into that:). for lunch ....at the grill on the beach....two buffet restaruants here. they start officially at 1pm, but we always found at 12:00...things were up and running...guacamole and chips and fresh salsa...yummm, hamburgers and fries and onion rings, hot-dogs and then the mexican dishes and salads and pastas, salads, seafood and different dishes every day at the inside grill...one day was chicken swiss another was veal parmasan another was roast beef, another was turkey and so on...again....if you can't find something here......the food was wonderful. One day is paella on the beach...Wednesday I think...another was BBQ chicken on the beach...sooooo good....tuesday I think... dinners.....we loved the buffets! Carvery every night...lobster night....lots of seafood, mexican dishes and everything else you could imagine at a buffet...make sure you ask for mexican coffee....dark cofree with coffee liquor and tequilla...really nice...the wine we drank was red and we liked it...mostly merlot's and other light wines...not sweet, just nice. We ate at the tropical one night which was not my favourite as it is mostly seafood and I am not a seafood person. the Mexican restaurant was wonderful. We cancelled our reservations at the Japaneese restaurant, as we wanted to dine our last night at the buffet as we loved it so much and we had a waiter we loved.....tip them please...even just a few dollars....they work so hard. You can get room service from 11 to 11...we did not do this as we were never really in our room! the pool was wonderful. Big and clean and meandering. We brought our own floaties for the pool and beach....well used. We had to play the towel game when we were by the pool. After 7am, you will find nothing at pool side...if that is your thing, under a palapa. Go down at 6:30am and throw a towel on...hate this...but had to cave by thrid day! the drinks wer really nice. got them at both buffets and at beach bar...mojitos, banana daquiris, zombies, margueritas, beer and so on. Tipped every second drink one dollar...was much appreciated. We had poool service and beach service on some days too...very nice. Beach was very pretty. Not as big as pictures posted in January, but still nice. Was room for 5 to 6 rows of beach chairs. We could not find a palapa after 9am, but always found a chair...even at noon one day...no worries. Just sign out an umbrella if you need one at towel station. Most umbrellas are gone by 12 noon though. there is a \"shelf\" that you have to step down on...about a foot...to gain entry into water. small shells and rocks first 5 feet or so, then wonderful sand. When we were there we had unseasonable cool temps first two days 18-22 celcius...then wonderful warm weather after that. Perfect for us though,as we opted to do a tulum tour. would not have made it an hour in extreme heat in tulum....hardly any decent beach at tulum...dissapointed, but hey, we had wonderful beach at iberostar tucan/quetzal. Don't hire a private guide here...paid 35$ and only had him 30 minutes...rushed through with 8 other people ...and ...he was an \"official\" guide and would not answer many questions...just follow behind bus tour every now and then to get info. Go early as it heats up here like you would not beleive!!! We took cab into town and then colectivo for 5$ for both of us....took maybe 40 minutes to travel total time. Took colectivo back ...same again. Walked the beach and could go south past sandos for a mile or so....then other way and saw hotels with no beaches north towards town in playacar. when you reach the riu playacar...hardly any beach...then royal hideaway has none and retaining wall cracking ...very sad. the star-friends really make this place by the way. During the day, they get people into contests and exercise at pool etc. always coming by and saying hola...all the workers here do! They ask if your vacation is going well and so on. they are very genuine. One girl ate lunch with us....so hard working and friendly. You would think they were professional dancers when you see their shows at night, but they are not ...audition all over the world for these positions. One from Canada, two from Brazil, two from Holland, some from Mexico and so on.... The shows at night are amazing in the open auditorium, but covered.at top....there is a large bar and there is service at tables...seats about 1000 people, but never felt over-croweded. they start with kiddie show about 8:30pm and then onto audience participation show, then the \"big show\"...don't miss the broadway show....wowo is all we can say. not cheesy at all Took a trip to other iberostar...paradiso beach...not allowed at lindo...took cab into town as there is no shuttle and then colectivo to this resort...lets you off on side of highway by resort for 2$ ...you walk into resort. Lindo not overly friendly...no one says hello there. clean and beautiful, but huge and too big for us. Pool was nice, but beach very rocky. next door is pariso beach etc and we loved the pool and swim up bar, but again did not like the beach. also not as friendly here as tucan/quetzal...seems like the resort was older too...not sure when it was built. would go back to tucan/quetzal in a heart beat...all staff, grounds-people work tirelessly, friendly and accomodating. the only negative expericence was front desk....changing money...also not so friendly...oh well...nothing is perfect. go into playa del carmen...pretty...kind of singles bar attitute at night though...loved it during day. Playacar is a gated community where this hotel is and is very very safe. Very clean...a few shops, but better pricing in playa del carmen...tulum ruins vendors very expensive by the way. Have a wonderful trip, and tip the workers a dollar here and there, I know it is an all-inclusive, but they so deserve a few dollars. the food, rooms, beach, pool, gardens, Monkeys...yes monkeys (there are a few families...saw them near the buffets...babies 6 months old...saw about 12 all together one day), wildlife, all get an A plus from us! thanks to the star-friends in particular!", "Date": "February 26, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Panama City Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cAwful Food..we starved\u201d", "Author": "carleyrohan", "ReviewID": "UR6812403", "Content": "Accomodations were great, very attentive staff, sometimes the entertaining was a little much, but all very nice people.

The grounds are beautiful, we never knew what kind of wildlife we would see, the pool is HUGE, the service superb and the beach is something that cannot be described in words!! We loved having a different towel animal on our beds each day and the staff were always very friendly and helpful. The room service was nice and very prompt. The buiffet restaurants had a never-ending selection so if someone could not find something to eat I think there was something wrong with them. The ala carte restaurants were very good as well. We did the Japanese and the Steakhouse. The japanese was very good although it was a long meal due to the table side cooking. The steakhouse was very good as well, my steak was very tender and I could cut it with a fork. The beach...what can I say about it. It is absolutely gorgeous, crystal clear blue water, white sand, lots of sun. We never had any problem getting a palapa but if they are taken, you can get a large umbrelly from the stand where you get your towels. There is always something to do, if you want, but there is plent y of room to just lay around and enjoy the weather. The landscaping is breathtaking as well. We did the lobser sunset cruise as an excursion and it is definitely worth the $80.00 per person price. Very romantic and lots of fun!! Final assessment, would definitely go back. We have been to AIs in the Dominican as well as Acapulco and this was the best.

What a beautiful hotel. The lobby is stunning. At check in all of us were updated with Junior Suites. We had rooms 2006, 2009 and 2012. We had an ocean view room with the beach/ocean only steps away. BEACH: No issues with getting chairs at all. Wished the beach was a little cleaner - cigarette butts, rocks, etc. But not bad. FOOD: We had dinner at the Steak and Mexican Restaurants. The food at both places was great. The breakfast/lunch buffets are fine. ENTERTAINMENT: We went to the Disco one night. It did not get busy until after 10:00 or so. Does smell a little musky. Bring comfortable SHOES - it is no fun coming home with blisters. Happened to me! ALWAYS try to take your camera with you. We saw a parade of Monkeys navigate from trees to having to jump to the top of the hotel room Great site. Also, lots of other animals roaming about. EXCURSIONS: I participated in the Dolphin Swim. I booked on line from Dolphin Discovery at Puerto Adventuras. I was the only one in the group who wanted to do this. However, when you book let them know that someone would like to come and watch. My husband went along and there is a transfer fee of $10.00. Have someone bring a camera there also. Bought the video and pictures - my kids love it! Wonderful company - smooth transport. Bring extra money as there is shopping available. We booked through the hotel the \"Bar Hopping Tour\". This took you to three locale hot spots in Playa Del Carmen. Very well run - always had a tour guide around. There is a one time free of around $60.00 or so. Includes transfers, admission and drinks for the night. Bring camera also. Don't be afraid to let the hotel staff take pictures of you at dinner/at the beach. You don't have to purchase them but can view them in the lobby. I think a 5 X 7 of all of us at dinner was $5.00 usd. Wish we would of had more taken. Take alot of pictures - wish we would have. Went shopping in Playa Del Carmen - $5.00 cab ride one way from hotel. Worth going into town - do some bargaining. Check a few shops before you buy silver. Some shops just throw out a price while others weigh the silver. Most will give a discount for cash. Just a note - there are some topless women and nude children on the beach. Had a great time!

We chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and our previous experience at an Iberostar in the Domincan Republic. WEATHER: The weather was fantastic! Sunny for the most part but not too too hot. It rained one morning and the forecast was for two more days of showers but they never materialized. One of the Starfriends told us never to believe the weather forecast on the TV. RESORT: The resort is very pretty. Nice natural trail to the suites and plenty of wildlife. Loved the giant gerbils! And, of course, the monkeys! We stayed in the 2700 block of rooms which overlook a manmade lagoon chock-a-block with flamingos and other birds. Would definitely recommend staying in this section. There doesn't seem to be any real difference between the Tucan side of the resort and the Quetzal side and you share the same benefits. If you're looking, go with whichever is cheapest. The rooms are standard. There were no drawers in our room, but this was a minor consideration. The air conditioning worked, the maid service was good and despite having kids in the next room we never heard them... and hopefully, they never heard us! POOL: The beach and pool are very nice. I don't think the resort was at capacity, because we never seemed to have trouble getting a sun bed. There is a separate kiddy pool, a separate swim-up bar pool and a separate pool for water sports, so it's always relaxing to swim in the main pool. FOOD: The food was average for an all-inclusive. Breakfast was the best. Definitely better at the main restaurant than at the beachside. We had 3 a la carte meals - The Steakhouse (so, so) The Japanese (way too salty. It's Teppanyaki so watching them prepare the food is the best thing about it. We might be spoiled because there are lots of fantastic Japanese restaurants where we live but this restaurant was a disappointment) The Italian (Best meal we had at the resort. Lots of selection and amazing desserts!) THE TOWN: The hotel is a 30 minute walk to Playa del Carmen. Definitely worth the visit. The GF was happy to see all the shops and the folks at VISA will be happy for all the business. The food was definitely better in town. From Playa del Carmen you can catch the ferry to Cozumel. DAY TRIPS: We went across to Cozumel one day on the snorkeling tour through the hotel's dive centre. We had been told the reef was amongst the best in the world but still consider ourselves lucky to have seen a turtle, a shark, some stingrays and a giant lobster. Oh, and we swam with dolphins! Guess they were curious about our group and came swimming right up to us. Unexpected and awesome! On this day trip you also get to spend some time at the Iberostar resort at Cozumel to have lunch. It's very quaint and peaceful. Would also recommend the trip to Chichen-Itza. It's a 3 hour bus trip but the one we were on also stopped at a ceynote (natural sinkhole with deep water) where we went swimming. Our guide was very knowledgeable and the ruins were fantastic, although you should note that you can't climb up the temples here (apparently you can in Coba). We booked this one through Signature.

Quetzal from Jan 12-19, 2007. This was our 7th stay at an AI resort on the Riviera Maya and I have to admit this one has to be at the top of our list of places to return to. Our flight from STL on Funjet was uneventful and when we arrived in Canc\u00fan, ours' was the only plane there at that time so we made it through immigration in record time. Got the green light again in customs and had very little trouble moving through the Timeshare people to our Lomas Rep. Our large bus was occupied with 15 couples all going to this resort so off we went, while getting the low-down from our guide Carlos. Carlos not only explained everything we needed to know but served us some fine ice cold cervezas on the 35 min trip to our hotel. The lobby is as spectacular as most in the area and reception and check in when smoothly. We had arrived around 11:30am and about half of those on our bus had their rooms ready. Ours was not and as usual I would expect to have it ready to go after 3pm but after a quick self guided tour of the grounds, pools and beach with a very nice buffet (peal and eat shrimp) we checked back at reception and our room was ready at 2. We had gotten our request of a quiet 3rd floor room and was pleased that the A/C had cooled the room to a very delightful 21c. Down to the beach, and beach bar of course, for about an hour, then it was time to clean up and relax before dinner. OUR STANDARD ROUTINE FOR THE WEEK: Breakfast buffet at 8. Kay to the gym for a work out at 9 and I to the lobby bar at the same time for my work out with several Bloodymarys. To the beach for sun and fun and lots of really pretty women. Drinks from the beach bar and at 1pm lunch at the main buffet. Back to the beach till 4 and a quick shower back at the room and a 1 hour siesta prior to dinner. Lobby bar at 5:15 to meet up with new friends we met. Mr. Charles and his partner Mary were quite the fun couple. Lots of others to talk to but their names escape me now. Dinner at 7 either in the buffet ( really good and lots of variety ) or at the 3 speciality resturants (Mexican, Tropical, and Steakhouse) that we were able to chose. After dinner down to the theatre to watch the little kids do their show and to have a couple of dances before the \"BIg Show\", by the Star Friends. The bartenders in the theatre are very good as on our second day there, they already knew me and upon my arrival at the bar they asked \u00bf\"Senior, your usual\"? That being a double Ballentines on the rocks. Good tips to all the bartenders especially Catalino, there in the theatre. Midnight, bed time, door open, sound of ocean and that lovely tropical breeze. ROOMS: Standard but very comfortable. Clean. Great view of tropical fauna and we actually had a nice partial view of the ocean (nice little extra). Our maid had our room cleaned and stocked before 9:45 each day. We are early risers, so that may have something to do with that. The beds are firm as all I have experienced in all Mexican resorts and this Kay and I don't mind a bit. We have some of the best nights' sleep on those beds. FOOD: Fantastic...anyone who complains about the food needs to either have their head examined or just don't go to these places. The buffet was varied and delicious with lots of salads and veggie offerings. Usually 6 or more choices of meats and lots of mexican dishes. We had lobster on Thursday night and I will NOT tell you how many I had. I think the lobster is now on the endangered species list. Following is a partial list of meats served: lobster, shrimp, mussels, several different fish species, chicken cooked many ways, lamb, veal, beef roast, roast suckling pig and I'm sure I missed something else. Lots of non smoking areas in the resturants and never once was I bothered with tobacco smoke while eating. BARS: NO watered down drinks here. Lots of premium labels and all you have to do is ask. Need a double, no problema. The bartenders are a great group and all speak english very well. Several who I got to know well, daily we practiced engish and spanish together. They don't even seem to mind when asked to make the labor intensive MOJITO, one of my absolute favorite mixed drinks. POOL AND BEACH: This place has a very nice large and clean pool with lots of shade palapas. As in most resorts it is difficult to find a chair at the pool after 8am. Not much of a problem for us since we enjoy the beach much better. The beach is one of the best in the area. Very clean and white sand. We had lots of surf the first 3 days and lots of wind but that didn't keep me from body surfing which was very good on those rough sea days. Yes, prudes, there are women who sunbathe topless. Good for them. I really didn't see or hear anyone offended by that and as a matter of fact, it seemed most men enjoyed the mild \"titillation\". There are four bars serving the beach/pool area so there is no more than a minutes wait for a drink. THE GROUNDS: I can't even guess how much the tropical fauna cost to put in and maintain. This is a jungle lovers paradise. Every where you look the area is just packed with beautiful colorful plants. Lots of exotic birds, lizzards, large turtles and the ever present agoutis,(search Wikipedia for this strange looking animal). STAR FRIENDS: The animation staff is just great. All of them are very friendly and outgoing and ready to make your vacation enjoyable. The lovely KERRI, from Canada, stole our hearts. She is so beautiful and talented. She even got me to dance with her, my pleasure of course. When she dances during the show you can really see she enjoys her job by the genuine smile on her face and the lights in her eyes. Kay and I wanted to bring her home with us, but I would hate for future visitors to miss out on meeting this lovely young woman. In addition to the Star Friends, a troup of Mayan dancers put on a very entertaining show about their past heritage. I've seen several of these over the years along the RM but this one was the BEST. It was a super high energy, non stop aboriginal music and dance performance one should not miss for anything. The costumes were spectacular with all of the animal pelts and feathers. The music was all drum, shell trumpets, shell rattles and pipes, making for an almost other worldly experience. SO NOT MISS THIS SHOW! TIPS: Many guests I saw did not leave tips, I on the other hand tried to make up for that. Maids $20 pesos per day, Bartenders $20 pesos per encounter with another $1-$2 usd for exceptional service or for spanish lessons rendered, Servers in the buffet resturant $20 pesos per encounter, Servers in the specialty resturants $50 - $100 pesos depending on service, Bellboy $50 pesos for 4 bags. Please, if you are so inclined, tip these workers as the average daily wage is about $60 pesos (less than $6 usd). WEATHER: The first 3 days we had 30-40 min showers in the morning around 9am. Very windy, heavy surf and after the rain solid sun the rest of the day. The next 3 days, no rain what so ever. Wind back down to a nice, less heavy breeze, the surf mellowed out a bit but still had nice crashing breakers. Very much sun all day. The last 2 days a little shower in the morning for 20 min then sun out the rest of the time. All good things must come to an end and so it was with this vacation. A quick \"adios\" to everyone and a final tip as thanks and we were off to the airport in Can\u00fan. Very quick luggage inspection done by testing for what I guess is explosives residue since all they did was wipe certain areas of our luggage without the usual internal inspection. I bought a few bottles of scotch in the duty free shop and it was delivered to the gate with no problems. The flight back to St. Louis was quick and once again uneventful. Then the hassels begin....Immigration-no problem, luggage pick- OK. We then had to put our duty free liquids and gels into our checked baggage and have that rechecked. We ourselves had to once again go through the whole security screening insult as our luggage was transfered to a carousel at the far end of the airport. It took over 1 hour 45 min from exiting the plane to exiting the airport. The usual terminal (EAST) is being remodeled so that charters now have to enter / exit / re-enter the Main terminal before allowing you to actually take final custody of your checked luggage. I sure hope by the next time I'm going back to M\u00e9xico (June 07) the charters are doing business out of the East terminal as usual. BTW, I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO REVISIT THIS RESORT.

This is a review about how things went accessibility-wise. I e-mailed several transfer companies and found one, Cancun Transfers, that claimed to have a wheelchair accessible van w/ ramp. They actually contracted w/ Balam Transportaciones who just remove the front bench seat from the full-size van. The roof is not raised so I couldn't quite sit up straight and the ramp is not too long so it is quite steep but is much better than most alternatives. While down there I noticed some raised-roof Toyota vans from El Nopal. Apparently they have ramps too & can be contacted at nopal@prodigy.net.mx or through Iberostar services. Continental Airlines treated me well & did not quibble about my huge \"medical equipment\" box (shower wheelchair). I wasn't able to get bulkhead seats going down & regretted it but was more insistent on the way back & was successful. I asked Continental for assistance after we landed & they provided a fellow who whisked us all thru baggage & customs. The Quetzal was mostly accessible & I could get anywhere I wanted to, just not by the most direct route. The Tucan side had almost no steps but apparently the rooms were the same. Each side has 2 accessible rooms which are in the buildings closest to the lobby & farthest from the beach. The Quetzal side has a disco immediately next door w/ accessible room 2911 being the closest of all. People in there frequently demand a different room. The accessible rooms had roll-in shower stalls that were slightly bigger and had smooth entrances. The regular rooms had 4\" high & wide lips to get over to get into the shower, more than I would want to try. Also I doubt my chair would make it into the smaller reg shower, judging by the limited extra room in the accessible stall. BTW, compared to normal the showers were big, I'm comparing to huge roll-ins. Customer Service was very helpful, getting me a rollaway bed ( I couldn't use the king-size bed), built a ramp up one step (which I could have avoided by going around a bit), turned off the motion detector (which had let the a/c turn off when I didn't move enough), & tightened some loose screws on my wheelchair. Ilse (tall & Dutch) in Customer Service knew of Samuel Reyes, a paramedic, who had reliably assisted someone the year before. He was experienced (to what degree I never could tell), strong, willing and prompt, the last 2 being v important. His English was only passable & I intend to learn more Spanish b4 I go back. He charged $100/day which I thought high considering I needed him only a couple hours in the morning & 1 hr at night. He was still able to work his full shifts on the ambulance. That still was a lot cheaper than bringing an attendant. As far as accessible outside activities go, I only went to Tulum & 'downtown' Playa Del Carmen. The Tulum trip was arranged at 8AM for a 9:30 trip on Balam & the ramp was up in Cancun so some bellboys or taxi drivers were enlisted to lift me in my chair into the van. Most of Tulum has flat pathways but there were steps leading up to the 'high points'. Very cool place, but sliightly disappointing since I couldn't get to the grand vistas. Took the sidewalk to town & glad I did. Playacar (the hotel zone) is great but not real Mexico. Of course PDC probably isn't either but it's real enough for me. Anyway the sidewalk is better than in my neighborhood & it took us 35 minutes at marching speed, strolling could add 15 mnutes. Most of the shops had big steps going in so my actual shopping was limited but that matched my money so no problem.

All I can say is wonderful!!!! The front lobby was stunning all decorated for Christmas. Check in was a breeze. We were greeted with a tropical drink, and a friendly \"hola\" Our room wasn't ready yet, so we checked out the beach, ate at the buffet and shortly after were in our room. At first I was slightly disappointed in our room. We were in building 25. I had booked our reservations in July and I had wanted to be close to the ocean, however, we loved our location, midway between the lobby and the ocean, We spent alot of time going back and forth so it was actually a great location. The room itself is large and well-appointed. Two double beds, and little sleeper couch, mini fridge and a great bathroom. The shower was huge!!!! Large enough for 2 with great water pressure. The shower had shampoo and a soap dispenser . The maid service was great!!! The staff works so hard to keep everything clean. Everyday we had towel art and chocolates or flower petal creatures, simply lovely. We did however, tip everyday and left Holiday gifts for our maid. If we needed more pop or water we just left a note and it was filled up daily. Our son, 18 years old, brought 2 friends, they were in the room next to ours and everyday, the maid would fold their clothes if they left them on the floor. The work so hard, please tip them!!!! Room service is also great!!! Our son and his buddies sometimes had room service twice a day. It came quickly and was always delicicous. The buffets were also delicious. Great assortment of foods and so beautifully displayed. No one got sick and we always found plenty of variety. We did do 3 specialty restaurants. The Japanese, the Italian and the Steak house, all very good. Again, the staff make it sooooo very enjoyable. Everyone bends over backwards to help and to make your stay a great one!!!! The Star friends were also wonderful. The head Star Friend, I forget his name was simply amazing. Speaking fluently in 4 different langauges, he ran the entertainment portion with great passion for his work. Again the star friends work such long hours. 6 days, 14 hours a day, and they were amazing. The beach party, dance contests, pool games, evening shows, the living nativity, santa parasailing in, the Christmas show by the beach all spectacular. We loved every minute of our stay. The grounds were spotless and the jungle full of amazing creatures. Monkeys, peacocks, cute little rodent type creatures, birds and iguanas. And now for the beach. Large, powder soft and beautiful!!! The Quetzal's beach has no problem with erosion. The closer you get to town, the beach disappears. We stayed at the Allegro 3 years ago, and they have no beach, very sad. There is an ice cream bar and bar service by the beach, along with the beach buffet. We usually ate lunch at the beach buffet. Hamburgers, hotdogs, guacamole, pasta, fruits and an assortment of yogurts. Pop, water and juice is self serve, there is also a bar in the beach buffet. Our boys loved the activities pool. Everyday they played water basketball and water volleyball. We also loved the swim up bar. Adults only, set off from the main pool. It was nice to get away from the younger children. This truely is a family resort. Lots of generations of families. Young and old. You will truely enjoy your experience at the Quetzal :) I could go on and on, truthfully it was amazing. I had done lots and lots of research from Trip Advisor before booking this resort in July. Thanks Trip Advisor. The forums and the reviews helped me pick the Quetzal.

It was our first time in Mexico and we chose Playa del Carmen as it seemed to be a less tacky resort compared to Cancun, and having visited Cancun for the day we were pleased that we had made this choice. The resort itself is out of this world, the walk down to the pool each day was great, especially looking for different animals in the 'jungle'. We were lucky and saw the monkeys quite a few times, even when they were raiding the balconies of the rooms on the top floor near the activity pool! The a la carte restaurants were mostly fine, but by far the best was the Japanese and we ate there a number of times. Although to be fair the buffet has a good enough selection. The staff were extrememly helpful and never seemed to go home. Our room was in the block near the reception and we were woken up quite a few times by the maids (whose cupboard was outside our room) and people leaving the club at night. Apart from that the rooms were basic but fine and like some others have mentioned keep the patio doors closed for the air con to work. The only problems we found with the hotel was that after a week of seeing the star friends show each night we were a little bored with the entertainment. Although to be fair the effort put in by the star friends has to be admired. Some nights were better than others, the audience participation nights were by far the best - v funny. We also went to the nightclub a few times, however after two tries we gave up as it was more like being in youth club than a night club. We did suggest on feedback cards to the hotel that an age restriction be placed on the club, as it appeared to us to be an out of hours creche. After that we went into Playa del Carmen a couple of times and that was great. I'd suggest not to go on one of the organised tours as they take you to the same bars and charge you over the odds for doing so. We wished we'd just made our own way there in the first place as they tend to take you to the Senor Frogs end and there are so many better bars further down such as the Blue Parrot. The only other issues we had were people getting hold of the sunbeds as soon as they were put out at a ridiculous hour in the morning. Unfortunatley as we go on holiday to relax we didn't want to get up at the crack of dawn to get a sunbed, so had to make do on the beach most days. which for someone who burns easily didn't prove to be a suitable option when all the umbrellas were taken. Also we did encounter on most days large groups of people who would effectively take charge of an area of the pool or pool bar, stopping others from using it. It became increasingly annoying as the day wore on and they got drunk, fortunaltey the pools are big even to try and escape from the morrons, although the sound of them whooping and hollering when one of them downs a thimble full of beer still filters through occasionally. If you want a fantastic pool/beach resort with really helpful staff and somewhere to just relax and not do much then this resort is for you. I'd recommend it but would probably go back with a few others next time as we found that at times we were at a loss for things to do and people to talk to.", "Date": "January 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stockholm, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cClose to Paradise\u201d", "Author": "MagnusW", "ReviewID": "UR6526867", "Content": "We spent one week's vacation in Playa del Carmen - Nov 6-13. We're a family of two adults and two sons (10 & 12). We purchased flight tickets from Apollo/Novair and accommodation directly from the hotel. Iberostar Quetzal was VERY luxurious and elegant, but also (as a consequence?) a bit \"chilly\" and \"unfamiliar\". Nevertheless, I perceive the resort as very safe and family friendly. The entire property, including the hotel room, was very well decorated, comfortable, and with a distinct \"high-end\" touch. There is even a small park with various animals (monkeys, flamingos, etc) in the centre of the property. The staff were were friendly, especially the non-mexican staff (from Denmark, Spain, Canada, Netherlands, etc). I believe most guests came from North America (USA), very few were from Europe or other continents. We ate all meals in the hotel's buffet restaurants, i.e. the main restaurant for breakfast and dinner and the pool restaurants for lunch. The food was good but not overwhelming. Generally the choice, as well as the tastefulness were less then at Riu Tequila (note: we stayed at two different hotels). On reason for this might be Iberostar's higher focus on the a la carte restaurants, a service we didn't utilize due to the fact that buffet restaurants have a wider variety of food and are thus more suitable for families with kids. The hotel arranged various sport activities, like air gun competition, introduction to diving, water aerobic, diving, bicycle tours, from approx 10 in the morning to 16 in the afternoon, 7 days a week. We enjoyed air gun shooting, diving, and water aerobics. I really recommend these activities as they are nice \"breaks\" in the sunny and otherwise carefree existence. We didn't go on any excursions outside of the resort due to the fact that we only had one week's vacation. Next time I'd rent a car as the roads seemed to be fairly drivable. After the introduction to diving (free) we signed-up for an beginners course (charge) in diving at Dressel Divers, [----]. All activities and equipment related to water sports are managed by Dressel Divers. Diving and activities driven by an engine are at a charge, non-motor equipment, like catamarans, windsurfing, are free. We got approx. 1 1/2 h theory, 1 1/2 h practice in the pool and two 1 1/2 h dives in the ocean. A great - but challenging - activity! One thing we learned the \"hard way\" is that it's very important to disinfect the ears before and after a dive - or for that matter a day in the pool - in order to prevent so called swimmer's ear (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otitis_externa). Warm water hosts large quantities of bacteria! Iberostar Quetzal is perfectly situated along the Playacar beach; palms, lovely soft white sand and the magnificent blueish warm ocean - quite a paradise (although exploited). You may discuss if it's important or not to be close to the beach, but is undoubtedly worth a lot if you like to stay reasonable close to your kids - if they as ours - prefer the pool area. The pool area was large, very swimmable, and offered plenty of sun-beds both in both sunny and shady areas. As mentioned earlier we booked two hotels, both good-raters on TripAdvisor; Riu Tequila and Iberostar Quetzal. Iberostar Quetzal is in my opinion a slightly better option then Riu Tequila... so if you can afford the extra cost, it's a given... and if you can't, I can assure you'll be very satisfied with Riu Tequila. If you stroll along the beach you'll se that the hotels/resorts at the south-end have utilized the beach better then those in the north end. Thus my general hint to you is to at least narrow down your selection to the hotels south of, and including, Riu Playacar. See [----]. Take care.

I know that alot has been made about getting out of the pool to go to the swim up bar, but it was rather nice to have a secluded \"no kid\" zone available. Our rooms were on the Quetzal side, in the middle between the beach and the lobby. Rooms were spacious and clean. Yes, the beds were hard, but not so hard we all didn't sleep. The \"day bed\" mattresses are moveable, so if you want to have a \"grandkid\" sleep over, they each can have a place to crash. We all thought the food was good, even at the buffets even tho it did repeat some of the foods often. We tried the Mexican (ok) and the Japanese (great food). As other have stated, the ressies were easy to make, but make them early as they fill up fast. We were there at a very busy time and the earliest time they had was 8:30 at both places. For those of you that are Catholic, it is a short ride into town (about 5 minutes) to Our Lady of Carmen. The times we were told were 8am, 10am, 6pm and 8pm. We took the 8am time. Be aware that the church is open with no airconditioning and it does get hot. The church does provide the readings and responses written in different languages so you can read along. The shows were pretty amaturish (sp?), but better than at some of the resorts we have seen. They do a special kids show at first and get all the kids involved. Our grandkids asked to go every nite after the first nite. The bar service is outstanding, and you can get just about anything you want by asking. They even have some \"special\" bottles underneath the bar if you ask. We went into town on 2 occasions and had a good time.

The food was not bad at all and the specialty restaurants really did break up the monotony of the buffets. The hotel grounds, pool, and beach are gorgeous- we were very pleased. The bed was HARD but easily fixed by requesting an egg shell mattress to be placed on top- it really helped. I would really like to commend the staff for an excellent job. The grounds were spotless, the rooms clean, the all-day activities fun and well organized. I am shocked by the negative reviews but I guess some people are hard to please but then we all know people like that. Anyway, additional cudos go out to the dive shop. I recieved my PADI Open Water certification while I was there and did a couple of post-certification dives at Cozumel. They were always professional, safe, and accomodating- I highly recommend them. Special thanks to Andy and Debora for their patience and assistance. I think I'm spoiled now because all my reading has made it clear that Cozumel is some of the best diving in the world, oh well. I guess we will have to go back soon.

Many of us were all from the same family (the brides side); others were Grooms family & some of friends of both families. For the majority it was a 1st time experience at an all Inclusive Resort and as near as I could tell they truly enjoyed themselves. The Resort is beautiful with Jungle and pathways between the two resorts (Quetzal & Tucan). Wildlife abounds and will walk right up to you if you stand still. There were plenty of places to eat (buffets & restaurants) and numerous bars; a theater, disco, spa, and many other activities located on resort property. The food was as I expected from an all inclusive; meaning the buffets became redundant after a few days but the dinner buffets tried to vary the main courses. Don't expect too much and you'll be completely satisfied.. meaning food isn't the same at home even though they make a good effort(steak is thin an tough, etc.) The rooms are very nice; all having a patio or balcony. I would take a junior suite if I return, which I expect we will; they are facing the ocean and larger in size. We only had a couple of complaints: 1) there are insufficient restrooms (number of stall sper restroom, and number of restrooms overall) in the vicinity of the pools and beach; 2) the pool(s) water was quite Chilly ! It isn't heated and since it gets dark early this time of year I assume it looses quite a bit of its warmth at night. 3) I was dis-satisfied with the swim-up bar area. It was in a separate pool so if you wanted a drink while in the big pool you had to get out and go to the other pool or go to a bar nearby; the Water in the bar pool was FREEZING. The Beach is beautiful and there were plenty of loungers at the beach and by the pools if you got out early enough. The really nice part about the beach is that there were not a lot of people trying to sell things and those that were did not pester you. The Resort did an excellent job with the wedding; it was beautiful. The personnel at the resort was wonderful, friendly and very helpful. I recomemnd that everyone take dollar bills for tips. A couple of dollars goes a long way to getting better than average service. I was quite disappointed to see that many people feel that because it's all inclusive they don't have to tip. These people worked very hard and deserved a little extra for their service. Another nice thing, unlike some resorts we have been to, you could walk around outside of the resort and shop in local shops; it is somewhat of a gated community with many resorts in a very beautiful area. And the younger ones of the group went to town a few times for shopping and night life. We will surely go back to this area again. Earlier reviews talked about the \"Loud Americans\" and I'm sure there will be some more soon. As we were 32 Very Loud Americans and we had other Americans Join in. But, we sure had fun.

We were a party of seven and for the most part agreed on the stay. First I think it is important to note the location of the resort for those driving themselves from the airport. We missed it the first time but found it with little effort. There is no sign on the street you turn into the Playacar Community and follow the signs for Hotel Zone. Upon arrival we were told we would be on the Quetzal side even thou we had booked the Tucan side. Not a big deal since they were very accommodating on the location of our rooms and placed us side by side in three rooms (Anna accomplished this task and I might add with a smile and great customer service). We walked back to our building, number 23, rooms 2344, 2345, 2346, excellent choice with view of jungle, pool and a mini view of the ocean in two areas of room 2346, third floor. Our luggage arrived within minutes of us arriving at the room. We began to explore the resort and what a treat, it is truly one of the most beautiful places I have seen. Well maintained and stunning to wonder through. We took a quick walk through the jungle after lunch. The resort is full of non-threatening wildlife, furry ones, birds, monkeys and lizards. The pools are wonderful with plenty of seating, but you will have to play the towel game to get a good seat. We went down daily around 5-6am to save seats and there were already loads of people there doing the same (we were told the resort was only half full when we were there so I can only imagine what it is like at capacity). The swim up bar is fun and we spent the afternoon of day two there, the bartenders were great and very fun to spend the day with. While I am on the subject of staff let me say that we had outstanding service the entire week. Everyone speaks as you make your way through the resort. I cannot express how wonderful the service was. Friendly, helpful and ready to meet your needs. My only concern with service involved a lock box in one of the rooms that needed repair and after the third request in two days we gave up as we had lock boxes in other rooms they used. It never got repaired during our stay. The rooms as many have said before are nice but the beds are hard. The rooms were very clean. The beach is magnificent and is as wonderful as described in other reviews. Many of the beaches in the Riviera Maya are rocky in the water and not very easy to navigate. That is not the case here it was sandy in the water and very enjoyable. The food oh the food where to begin. The food was just okay and realistically at times less than just okay. I have been to other all inclusives and frankly the food was better at the others. In my humble opinion (and the group agreed) the buffets were the best bet at least you had variety. The ala carte restaurants really were below average in my opinion. I am not a picky eater and was a bit disappointed as was my group (but with this said we did not go hungry). We ate at the Japanese, Steak and Mexican Restaurants and actually cancelled a reservation at the Caribbean because we were so disappointed. The monkeys played outside our room in the trees all week sometimes very difficult to see trees. On our last day I was pleasantly surprised to find four yes four monkeys on our balcony. They were fun to watch and seemed quite use to people being there. At times they would hang off the light fixture on the balcony and look into the room. They are great fun to watch. The Star Friends\u2026.they are the activity people in the resort by day and do the shows at night. The shows are just ok but a couple were very entertaining. This group works very hard to make your stay fun and they are very peppy and upbeat. Went to the disco one night\u2026..very fun but they are stuck in the 80\u2019s (great for this forty something). We had a great time. In closing I would recommend this resort highly (except the food). It is a family resort so expect some kids. We had a great time and I look forward to going back soon for a visit.", "Date": "November 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Louis", "Title": "\u201cCharming and exceeding expectations\u201d", "Author": "quetzal_guy", "ReviewID": "UR6078632", "Content": "My wife and I just returned from the Iberostar Quetzal on November 3rd after a week of relaxing and thoroughly enjoying heaven on earth. This place is wonderful. The staff was friendly and helpful. The accomodations in general were very clean and well-cared for. The room was not extraordinary but we didn't plan on spending any time there any way! The mattress is extremely firm - ok, hard as a rock. The food in the specialty restaurants was very good. Again, considering all of the advantages and costs associated with an All-Inclusive, it exceeded our expectations. If we were paying $75-$125 for a fine meal, we would have been disappointed - it is all in the expectations. Breakfast was perhaps the best - as they will make omelets (and over-easy, and sunny-side up eggs) to order and are constantly making pancakes and waffels and french toast in front of you. The buffets during the day were fine. The drinks were very adequate - especially for \"free\". Please tip the hard-working, good-natured staff - $5 per day for the room and a buck or two for a drink goes a long way for them. Going into Playa Del Carma is very safe and a fun excursion into tourism-land. You can walk (about 25 minutes) or it is a $5 taxi - very easy to do. Lots of things you don't need - and lots of people asking you inside their \"store\". As far as the water in the hotel, what the hotel serves for drinking is fine. They label the sink water as not for drinking - just bathing. The beach is beautiful - the sand soft and plentiful. As far as the topless bathers - well, it takes getting used to but eventually you can overlook them, kind of. The nightly entertainment is a collection of good people trying really hard - give them some credit and applause - and don't expect Broadway. All in all?

The setting in the \"jungle\" is excellent - i have never seen so many animals, we heard the monkeys but have yet to see them!! The path ways were all lit up at night round the trees etc. the rooms were excellent, i say rooms as we were upgraded from 2322 - which was superb, to 2032 due to a flood in our room. but 2032 was a junior suite with sea and beach view - absolute magic. the food was good but glad we took the opportunity of booking the restuarants as the food may get a bit repetative at the buffett- mind you there was always plenty to find, . the only one we did not go to was the tropical but the japanese was by far the best with the show cooking.

We were truly happy with the whole experience, and the hotel accomodations were above par. Would definitely return, and I'm already looking into Iberostar hotels at different locations. Room was very comfortable, and as mentioned by others, the mini fridge was not very cold. This was easily corrected by propping open the cabinet door. Beverages were kept nice and cold then. The towel sculptures were a nice touch. I spent all my time on the beautiful beach, strangely enough, there were two days of rough surf, with the red flags for swimmers. None of the water sport equipment was allowed out, and the undertow was very strong. Never had a problem getting a palapa on the beach; most of the time I was down there early while the hubby slept in, but even on the days we planned morning activities, we always found a spot in the afternoon. This could just be because we were there \"off-season, I don't know. I would definitely plan on coming here around the same time next year(when school is in session). Many activities are offered during the day, from dance lessons to spanish lessons, and my husband was thrilled to know there was soccer! I knew where he was everyday at 4pm, and he had a great time meeting players from other countries who love the game. The Star friends who organized the teams and played along where full of energy and enthusiasm. Great job! The suggestion to bring comfortable walking shoes was right on. I ended up purchasing bandaids for the blisters popping up everyday. Also had a problem with some of the sandals I did bring when I was on the wooden walkways outside the evening buffets. Some of the heels were skinny, and the distance between boards made it difficult to walk. Heels kept getting stuck in the gap until I had to take them off and walk barefoot. We were lucky enough to be in the 2200 building which is very close to the beach, pool area and pool restaurants. Every evening before dinner we went to the lobby bar for a drink and to listen to the talented guitar player. We enjoyed his playing so much that we would follow him to the other lobby bar the next night because he alternated where he was nightly. The food was good; I stayed away from the beef items because they tasted \"gamey\" to me, but my husband had a grilled hamburger every day at lunch (in addition to the other daily specials). I stuck mostly to the chicken and rice and experimented with different chiles and sauces. The Italian restaurant was very, very ,very good. The lambchops were great, and the veal melted in my mouth! The Mexican restaurant was also very good, the tacos were different and delicious. We were not impressed with the Steak house restaurant. The evening shows were entertaining, the emcee is very good, as are the dancers. We reserved this hotel based on an offer from an airlines, and for the price we paid, we got heaven!

It is not quite a 5-star resort, but it comes very close, especially for the cost. Lets begin with the most important part, the beach (since this is where you spend the most time). The Quetzal/Tucan has arguably the nicest beach of all the Playacar resorts. It is deep and wide, especially compared to the resorts at the north end of Playacar. There are plenty of palapas (for really white folks like me) and palm trees on the south end. There are also beach umbrellas available if all the palapas are taken. The roped off swiming area is huge, with the boat alley only taking up a little space at the far north end. There was beach drink service while we were there, though I think only because they were not very full. The funky Mayan beach showers were cool too. And you didn't have to walk far for lunch, with 2 shady lunch restaurants just off the beach. The food and drink: I'd say this is the only area the Quetzal is shy of 5-stars. Nothing is bad (evidenced by the 5 pounds I gained while there) but its not what I'd call spectacular either. The Japanese restaurant has good food, only the presentation is not as good as other hibachi places seen (no flying shrimp, onion volcanoes, or comedy routine). Being from Kansas City, I'm always going to be dissapointed with the steak place, though it wasn't bad. The other Americans we ate with thought it was good. The Mexican restaurant was by far the best. I recommend the tacos al pastor. The Italian place was just OK, but the lasagna was really good. Finally, the buffet - I don't know how anyone can complain about the buffet here. There was plenty of variety, theme nights, and some of the food was quite good. We even had lobster one night. The breakfast buffet was excellent, especially the omlettes made to your specifications. The rooms are excellent. The only flaw in ours was a little stain on the ceiling where the AC must drip a little. No biggie, given the extreme humidity. Everything was clean and well maintained. The beds are a bit firm, but welcome to Mexico, they're firm at every resort. Neat tile shower too, and no problems with water pressure or temperature. The grounds are amazing. I've been to other places with nice gardens and landscaping, but they weren't as impressive as the tropical forest here. Things have recovered nicely since the hurricanes last year, though you can tell where some trees are missing and others were thinned. The monkeys and other wildlife complete the tropical forest feel, even if its not all completely natural. They keep the restaurants, bars, and lobby spotless too. The evening entertainment was fun. We loved the mini disco, where the kids put on a show for everyone, even though it made us miss our kids (just a little). Its certainly not Vegas, but the performers and star friends work very hard and put on a good show. A little cheesy, yes, but just have a drink, pull up a chair, and enjoy. We love the Playacar area. This was our second stay there, and we can highly recommend the area over the Cancun high-rises and shopping center atmosphere. Being a gated community, the area is very safe and secure. Walking the beach and comparing resorts, I'd say that the Quetzal is one of the nicest. The Riu Yucatan next door looked nice, but huge and very constructed, lacking the charm of the tropical forest theme at the Quetzal. I would highly recommed the Quetzal as a quiet relaxing resort.", "Date": "October 22, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Austin, TX", "Title": "\u201cVery Enjoyable!\u201d", "Author": "A_and_B_vacation", "ReviewID": "UR5978876", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at this resort for 4 nights, and really enjoyed the experience.

They bend over backwards to make every experience a memorable one. Even when they are faced with guest who are rude and demanding they are patient, courteous and do everything within their power to grant the guest request and make them happy. It is amazing how they can manage so many people with so many request and still keep virtually all of their guest happy. The entertainment team (Marcos, Luis and the gang) do an incredible job, work long hours, and also manage to keep an eye on the kids and teenagers. They are a talented and lively group and you will love them. The housekeeping staff do a beautiful job with your room. They always leave towel \"sculptures\" on your beds and the room stays spotless. Be sure to leave them a few dollars every day for their hard work. The bartenders are great. they entertain you and will make you whatever you want as strong as you want. Make sure you carrry a few $$ to tip them as well...they don't care if the $$ is wet! The groundskeepers work before sun-up and past sundown to keep the place beautiful. The young man who cleans the pool area is the hardest working man I have ever seen. Make sure you show your appreciation to them because you won't find a more spotless resort. The facilities are great. If you can get a Junior Suite you should go for it..it is worth the $$. If you have a group of 5 or 6 try reserving the Presidential Suite. The Tucan and Quetzal each have 2. Let me tell you..they are fabulous!!! Bottom line: This resort is great for those with kids and a blast for young and older adults as well. You can chill or stay busy all day. Certainly some folks will complain ...but then again if you gave some people a bag of money they would gripe about the bag.

We have stayed at multiple all-inclusive resorts all over the Caribbean ranging from 4 to 5 stars & found the Quetzal to be outstanding. I think too many people get caught up in the star rankings. They see 41/2 or 5 star resorts & expect the Ritz. I think people should focus more on the price they are paying & the value they are receiving for their money. There are 5 star resorts all over the Maya Riviera area that range in price from $2400 to $6000 for a weeks stay. Do you really expect the quality & amenities to be the same at these resorts? From the moment we arrived to the resort, the entire staff could not do enough for us. As usual for an Iberostar, the service was outstanding! I had sent an email 2 weeks prior to leaving with a room request stating we were repeat Iberostar guests. When we arrived to our room, there was a giant fresh fruit basket, Iberostar t-shirts & a letter from the Management thanking us for being repeat guests stating to let them know if there was anything they could do for us. We never needed to ask for anything before it was already offered. Even on the beach, the service was so outstanding that many times more drinks were being offered before the current ones were empty. If you did actually need to get up & go to the bar for another fruity tropical cocktail, big deal. It was a short walk to the beach bar on an absolutely beautiful beach. We are \u201cbeach people\u201d & this was an absolutely fantastic beach. The water was crystal clear with beautiful shades of turquoise & blue. The beach was great for swimming as well as taking nice walks in both directions. No matter what time we got to the beach, we never had trouble finding a nice shade palapa to sit under. If you could not find a palapa, the towel hut provided umbrellas that could be set up anywhere on the beach you wanted. The pool on the other hand did seem to have all the seats reserved very early. Since we traveled in the low season, I can only assume it would be all out war during the high season if you wanted a \u201cgood\u201d seat by the pool. We really enjoyed taking the jungle paths everywhere we went throughout the resort. You saw something different each time (including the infamous wild monkeys) & it was absolutely beautiful lit up at night. Yes, the resort is fairly basic but kept spotless. Everyone working there was so friendly & you never passed a staff member without a Hola! & a smile thrown your way. The rooms were simple, adequate & very clean. The rooms with king size beds have huge walk in marble showers with two spray heads. Everywhere you went the marble floors would shine like mirrors. As for the food, we put on plenty of weight! Yes, the choices can be limited at the lunch buffet but it was all very good, fresh & kept warm. How can you go wrong eating at an open air restaurant while looking at a beautiful beach & ocean just feet away while being serenaded by a mariachi band? The breakfast buffet was basically the same everyday but the choices were endless. I am at a loss for words how anyone could complain about all the choices?? Everything offered was also fresh, warm & made on the spot if so requested. The ala carte restaurants were all good as well. Food is a very subjective topic so all I can say is book them all & try them for yourself. Please DO NOT listen to the negative reviews. I think a major portion of them are from people that did not do their homework prior to traveling or that would not be happy anywhere. If there was anything you were not happy with or needed, all you needed to do was ask & it would be resolved in minutes. If you are looking for outstanding service, fantastic beach, very clean basic room, tropical/jungle atmosphere, good price & most of all TOTAL relaxation then this is your resort!

So I thought I would write a review since this is how I came to choose this hotel. First who are we? We normally do city holidays, actually it was our first real beach holiday... It is also the first time we travel with our kids. We love nice hotels, and try to get them at great rates, usually manage it, my favorites are intercontinentals and kempinski, of course that was before children, now my priorities have changed. We were travelling me, my husband and 2 kids (ca 3Y and 9 m), and my inlaws (3 of them). Service OK nothing special, i am mexican and live in mexico now, so i am actually used to much better service than what was offered here. For example when checking in, i asked for a crib and was told if one was available i would get one, but in such a tone that it almost meant they are all taken and you wont. I did get one, but they were really unfriendly. Food Everything i expected. Simple all you can eat buffet, nothing more nothing less. I mean you have to be realistic for the price you are paying, an all you can eat, all day long? It was simple and enough... always salad, cheese and pizza on the menu, that was enough for us to survive. Nobody got sick, and i should mention my inlaws just came to visit from austria so they dont have a \"tamed\" stomach. We never tried the a la carte restaurants, did not want any sort of schedule... so preferred to dine in the \"proper\" restaurant which had a decent variety of salads, lunch was always in our swimsuits, so we stayed by the pool. We had no alcohol so cant comment on the quality. The diet coke never tasted right though. The ice cream was GOOD. Beach Gorgeous! I dont like the ocean and loved it! Also my babies! There were always umbrellas available, and you could get one on loan from the towel stand if the \"fix\" ones were all taken or to stay closer to the ocean, but we would get there at 11 and still find one. Too crowded? Not really but it is not peak season. Loads of topless, if this bothers you dont go here... But i saw a lot of topless walking around, from other hotels so I guess it is in playa everywhere the same. Entertainment I went to see only one and really liked it. My little one loved it, she danced and clapped and really enjoyed it. The humour of the entertainer is not my type, a bit \"dirty\" without being gross (always talking about the \"melons\"). But i guess to cater to a larger crowd it has to be like that... It did make me laugh. The dancers were really good. My inlaws went every night and they loved them all. The dance the star frineds do at the pool twice every day, was the hit with my 2 year old, she would scream \"time to daance\" and run there, so just for that i loved it! Pool Liked it, it has a shallow, ocean like part that is great to be with kids, thay have a large space to walk around, no danger, and i sat with the baby who also enjoyed it. But I was there tops 2 hours all together, we stayed mainly on the sand and the ocean. Buildings Stayed bulding 27, great view of the jungle, really liked that. faaaar away from the ocean, but that was ok, a bit of walking didnt hurt us, we had the strollers for the kids, however that was the big problem for me, no LIFT! And they wouldnt give us a ground floor room, as I said very unaccomodating. Rooms were ok, clean simple. They do say minibar will be restocked every other day. It was however not swept everyday either... I could feel the sand from the day before. Never left a tip there though, not used to, only in restaurants. So maybe that was why ;) We had ants, which to be honest i dont mind. Towels were never an issue. All in all after my long review, I liked it. I didnt really need the extra nice service since the hotel was so complete and well presented with the gorgeous beach. We stayed 90% of our time there. Would I recommend it? Deffinetely, but keep your expectations realistic. Dont expect 5 star, it is not. For it to be I would add a lift, better service (probably some waiters at the beach) and a bit more comfort in the rooms, yes the pillows were FLAT. The beds were ok though. Would I stay here again?

We booked our vacation from our local travel agent after reading many of the reviews from this board felt very comfortable with our choice. The reviews were very helpful and most of them were right on! This was our first trip to an all inclusive, we typically take cruise vacations, but wanted to try something different. We were greeted by at the front desk by a wonderful student who was on an internship from Holland. She was very friendly and always had a smile on her face. We were booked in building 26, but requested an upgrade to a jr suite in building 20. We weren't able to move into that building until the next day, but it was well worth the extra money to upgrade. We were on the first floor with a wonderful view of the ocean from our balcony. I would highly recommend building 20. Every room has a wonderful view of the ocean and you are very close to the pool and ocean. One of the main criteria I told my travel agent was that the hotel had to be clean. The Quetzal fit this bill perfectly!! It was very clean, there were always people cleaning everywhere. My only complaint was the food wasn't that great. The buffet by the pool got really old by the end of the week. We were allowed three of the ala cart restaurants. We chose the steakhouse, italian and the japensese. Our favorite was the italian. We put our name on the list for the tropical and the mexican. We were able to get into the tropical. It was ok. Service everywhere was wonderful, everyone was very friendly. I did have a massage and facial at the spa and it was well worth the money. The prices are very similar to those in the US.

The Iberostar resort is unique in that it is in the middle of a jungle. The foliage and wildlife is beautiful and amazing. Although the beach was beautiful, it was a little crowded for my taste. It's a shame the tourists that visited were so inconsiderate and would leave their garbage in the sand instead of using the waste receptacles. The staff there work really hard. There was a wide selection and variety of food and it all looked and tasted great. Unfortunately, three of us got sick by the third day. My brother got so sick, he was dehydrated from all the regurgitating and we had to take him to the hospital to be hydrated intravenously. The next day at the beach, we met a lady who also got ill from eating at the Mexican restaurant. Most of the restaurants are outdoors so you were always hot and uncomfortable while eating. It made it hard to enjoy the meal. Only three of the reservations only restaurants are air conditioned; Japanese, Mexican and Italian. The beds are rock hard; a mattress on a concrete slab.

It may not be top of the line, but it is pretty close! One week is not long enough! My husband broke his leg a month before we went and had a plate & 9 screws put in. So it was a little rough on him, but everyone from the airport and back were absolutely wonderful. The staff were very pleasant and as helpful as anyone could be. We can compare to RIU Playacar and the Quetzal is much better......staff, food, atmosphere, just everything in general. The Quetzal/Tucan is a great family resort. We didn't travel with children but being 31 and 34 and on our honeymoon, it was a great get-a-way!! The children that were there didn't annoy us at all. They have plenty of childrens activities and the pool is big enough that they don't get in your way or you in their way. The pool lounges did go fast, so we learned after the first day to get up at 6am and \"reserve\" your lounges with your towels. Also, take your own rafts with you and the dive center with inflate them for $1. The pool area does not allow topless (which I was perfectly fine with). The adult pool with bar is separate, which was nice. Everyone seemed to have a good time, but looked like it could get annoying. That isn't our cup of tea, so we didn't hang out in there. The beach is beautiful, no reef just crystal clear blue water!!! I can honestly say it is probably one of the nicest beaches there if not the best! The rooms were very good, spacious and clean. There will be occasional tiny lizards, which is fine....they won't bother you! You are in Mexico...in a tropical setting!! The food was good. The buffets were nice and the ala carte restaurants were wonderful. With a week stay you are guaranteed 3 reservations, but can get on a wait list for more and we got 2 more. The Italian \"La Gondola\" and Caribbean \"Tropical\" were our favorites!! The ala carte restaurants do REQUIRE men to wear nice pants, although the Caribbean and the steakhouse \"La Miramba\" do not, because they are in an outdoor setting. So dress shorts are appropriate. We also utilized the room service a couple of times and that was GREAT!!! All of the little animals everywhere are so neat!!! Monkeys, peacocks, iguanas, flamingos, swans, turtles.....on and on!!

We had beach front rooms, which I thought were well worth the extra money. I thought the service was very good, the rooms were very clean, and the staff was very pleasant and hard working. The staff seemed to appreciate small tips so much. We tipped the maid every day, and she kept our refrigerator stocked and left great towel sculptures. We were very happy with the food, and enjoyed the buffet and the regular restaurants. I do have a tip for those who have complained about the lunch buffet. The ones near the pool were not the best, but they had a very nice buffet every day at the regular restaurant closer to the lobby area. You just had to have a coverup for your swimsuit to eat there. I thought the drinks were great. Some people have said they were not very strong, but the bartenders would add more liquor if you asked them to. We loved the mojitos and the dirty monkeys. You could get champaign too. I don't know what brand it was, but I thought it was good The shows were kind of lame, but funny. They grew on us as the week went by. The star friends are nice and all worked so hard. We went to the disco a couple of times and it was really fun. All ages were dancing, from kids on up. We used the fitness center which was fine, and my daughters used the spa which was very nice and reasonably priced. We went on the snorkelling trip arranged by the dive shop which was fantastic. They offer all kinds of activities like exercise classes which my daughters enjoyed. The pool was huge and great to float around in, and the beach was beautiful with a nice swimming area. We rented wave runners on the beach - be sure to bring cash if you want to do that. The animals and birds abound the hotel were very entertaining.

First off, we are a married couple from CT that choose the Riveria Maya for our 2 year anniversary. I'm 31 and my wife is 27. Here's the scoop plain and simple regarding our expierence at the Iberostar quetzal. First off, we're beach people. If you like blue / green awesome water of the carribean sea with a nice beach, this is the place for you. Although the beach does get a bit crowded, you can always pull the chairs up to about 5-6 ft near the water and chill with a drink and a good book. I've heard folks complain about shade and getting up early, for us this was not an issue. We spent the majority of time in the sun at the beach and when we needed some shade at around 4pm, we just went to the pool area and by then the shady palapas were again available. The Staff and entertainment. First off, the staff is great. These people worked their butts off and always had a smile on their faces . .enough said. The entertainment was so cheezy that it was actually funny. It was good enough, however not nearly as good as the entertainment on some of the RC cruises we've been on. However, the way the theater is set up, you can come in half way through and still catch some of the show and not feel like you missed much . . this is beacuse it is mostly skits. We liked this because we ate later and never really felt rushed to get somewhere like I have on those cruises. Nice touch . . . The Food: Here we go . . .the food was, well, ok. If you enjoy gourmet, true 5 star american food, you may be disappointed. The breakfast buffet was the best. The lunch buffets after the 2nd or 3rd day bordered on not beieg edible and were kinda gross . . just becuase it was so hot and the food just sits . . sits and sits. It does get better at night. The food at the dinner buffets is average, while the \"specialty\" restaurants are fairly good to great. Of the three we ate at here is the ranking. 1. Jap 2. Italian 3. Steak House. We expected this from the info we received on the forum so we were not too disappointed, however in the future I think we would opt for a sit down meal every night as opposed to just three in a week. Also, the drinks are not very good at all, I don't drink booze so I can't comment on the content but the frosty drinks I was looking forward to never happened. The Strawberry Daquries and Pina Colada's were gross. It looked to be the same mix they have at a Seven Eleven. I drank mostly lemonade . . . I guess you get what you pay for or better yet what you already payed for . .ie, AI. The god send in all of this is that Playa is 5 min away and absolutely worth a visit or two . . .we ate there once and the food was awesome. Be prepared however, it is not cheap. The Resort: It's very, very nice. The jungle that runs through the middle is amazing and as far as we could tell was very unique to the resort. The rooms were average at best, clean, stocked fridge, safe, etc. Be sure and try to get one near the beach facing the INSIDE of the resort. We were in building 21 in room 2126 and loved it. The people seemed to be either from Texas, California, or Europe. It was actually kinda cool to hear the accents of our friends accross the pond . . .for the most part there are couples or families. Some advice . . we were there the first week of August so there maybe more kids than other times of the year. Although the kids did not bother us, there were alot of children at this resort and it seems to be very, very popular with families. If you're looking for a quiet, romantic vacation . . like a honeymoon you may want to consider an adults only resort . . . for us, just being in paradise set the tone for a romantic holiday but I wouldn't have choosen it for our honeymoon. (For our honeymoon we went to Nevis . . it was the best place ever!!) In conclusion. . .this is a very nice resort for the money . .the value is great. Would we go back . . . I would say yes, some day when we return to this part of Mexico I would stay at this resort again. We really did love the Riveria Maya region of Mexico. In the meantime, there are so many places we want to visit that I will keep using trip advisor in helping plan our next holiday . . . .Italy . . greece . . . turks, who knows, I can tell you that I'm counting the days though.

We did have a problem one day when the bar staff were ignoring serving the females. I had a quiet word with reception later on in the day and they sorted it!! No more problems. We ate in 4 of the five a la carte restaurants which were air conditioned and the food was very good there too. The attentive staff even came onto the beach to see if we required drinks. Yes, they might have seemed like they were watered down but if you ask for say Smirnoff instead of just vodka that is what you got.

The Tucan appeared to fit the bill. The flight from Glasgow, Scotland took ten hours and was quite comfortable, we travelled with Mytravel. We then endured Airport hell at Cancun on arrival. We were there for almost two hours in a packed airport trying to get through immigration and then trying to find our luggage! I nearly broke down as I thought our luggage was lost, however because immigration took so long it meant that our luugage carasoul had finished and was unloading another flights. Our luggage had been moved aside to another part of the hall. Phew!!! Got outside and it was very well signposted to our airconditioned people carrier. Arrived at the Tucan around 45 minuted later. Very impressed with check in. We had booked for the Tucan but were moved to the Quetzal side. As advertised in Britain, the Quetzal side is actually cheaper to stay in than the Tucan for some reason, however both sides were identical so it did not matter to us. As a honeymoon couple we were promised a basket of fruit and wine in our room on arrival, we didn't get that, again we were not that bothered. I had emailed a few weeks before requesting a sea view room on the third floor. We were in room 2246, they had fulfilled this requirement, we had partial sea view. Our room was so close to the pool area and beach, we loved this position. We also had excellent views of the monkeys most days. The pool and beach area was gorgeous, however you have to get up at 6am - 8am in order to get a sunbed with a palapa. It was sooo annoying all those people who felt it okay to reserve a palapa for a whole day and only use it for a few hours in the afternoon. The worst case scenario we saw was a couple who reserved sunbeds at the beach and pool, some in the shade and in the sun!!!!!!! All Nationalities did this, and all Nationalities go topless on the beach. This did not matter to us, however I have read other posts with a negative response to topless sunbathing. The food is average in our opinion. Our favourite restaurant was the Bonsai. The breakfasts were excellent with a really good choice. Infact there was a good choice in the buffets at lunch and dinner times, however after two weeks we discovered that all inclusives are not really for us. The entertainment was hilarious, actually that was just because we found it soooo bad. They worked hard and we do not want to take that away from them but it was not 4 or 5 star entertainment. The staff on the complex, with the exception of a couple at the beachside bar, were absolutely fantastic. I have never seen such hardworking people. We tipped those who we found worked really hard without much recognition as they did not offer a direct service to us. The appreciation was remarkable. We also tipped staff at meal times, at the bar and our room maid, but not every day. We found that our room maid only did towel art on the days that we tipped 20 pesos or more. Somedays we forgot or only had 10-15 pesos on us before we left for the day,so no towel art or flower or anything. In conclusion, we feel that this place is ideal for families, not honeymooners. There were big groups of people and families, and it just seemed more geared towards these people. It wasn't the romantic setting we thought it would be. We still had a wonderful time and loved relaxing by the pool and beach and going on a couple of tours.

The rest of the time we sweated through dinner in the open air buffet that was the same every night. We were hot and sweaty and the food was cold and dry. Yuck bad combo.

The food quality was very good, lots of variety and plenty to choose from each day. The carribean seaside a la carte restaurant was very good, as was the steakhouse, and mexican restaurant.

However, many people left the beach/pool by early afternoon, so if you are a late riser then you should be able to get shade in the afternoon. This hotel has a clientele from many countries (a lot of people from Europe, other Latin American countries, and the US). We are Americans, but consider ourselves to be cosmopolitan world travelers. Once the clash of cultures was an issue for us with a German couple complaining about kids making noise and playing in the water/on the beach. He said that he and his wife were trying \"to sleep\". My wife reminded them that this is a public beach and is a kids resort as well and that they might want to move to a couples-only resort if that's what they were looking for or go sleep in their rooms. Contrary to the other recent review, we didn't find the Americans to be outspoken or rude. In fact the loudest group were the Dutch, but they were just having fun. Which is what having a vacation is all about.

I spent so much time researching resorts on trip advisor I felt compelled to write a review when I returned. There were four couples in our group and we left the kids home for this trip. I was extremely impressed with this hotel and would recommend it to families and couples. Overall resort - Beautiful. So much better then I expected. Very, very clean. The jungle was fantastic. The animal life included flamingos, iguanas, birds, peacocks, monkeys and more. The monkeys were in various places and seemed to mostly come out to play between 5-8 pm. For some reason I got the impression that this hotel was old but it never looked that way to us. There were marble floors and walls everywhere. It was gorgeous from the lobby to the ocean. Beach - Perfect. The beach is one of the best I have every seen, and we have been to many beaches in the US and the Caribbean. Pool - Excellent. Very large and never seemed crowded even though the hotel was full. It was the end of July so the water was very warm, almost too warm. Adult only pool - This pool is next to the mail pool and is for adults only and it has the only swim up bar. This pools is very small and only for drinking (not swimming). I think it was a great idea having this pool isolated from children. It was a lot of fun but would get a little wild sometimes. The water was just a little cooler then the main pool and it felt very refreshing. Rooms - Like everyone else said the rooms are very clean but nothing special. Lots of people on trip advisor raved about the showers but we lived South Florida for 12 year and all the homes had showers like this or better, so while they were nice they were not that special to me. Restaurants - We were able to eat at the Mexican, Japanese and Italian. We liked the Mexican the best, then the Italian and the Japanese the least. Everyone at the hotel said to have the lamp chops at the Italian and they were correct. We could not get into the Steak or Tropical while we were there. The buffets were great for lunch and breakfast. Entertainment - This was probably the only thing we were disappointed with. I think most of the shows seemed geared to children and when we saw what they called the adult show at 9:30 it was mediocre at best, but still seemed good for kids. The Star Friends try hard but most of the shows seemed to be dancing with lip syncing. There were some good activities during the day but we didn\u2019t participate in most of them. Hotel Staff - Everyone seemed great. The bartenders were fantastic. If you tip them 1-2 dollars occasionally you will get all the attention in the world.

YES PEOPLE DO \u201cRESERVE\u201d (EARLY IN THE MORNING) THEIR SPOTS ALONG THE POOL AS WELL AS THE BEACH\u2026GIVE ME A BREAK PEOPLE and shame on the resort for not reinforcing their own policy. The beach: In 3 words OH MY GOD! One of the best beaches I have ever seen in my life. This is what makes this resort high on my list!!!!!! The food: You are only able to reserve 3 nights in the specialty restaurants out of a 7-day stay, which leaves you on stand by for the remainder or eating in the buffet. If you stay at the Maya for an example you can have a reservation every night of your stay. Okay enough of that\u2026the food quality is pretty good for all meals and regardless of where you eat. The service: WONDERFUL THROUGHT THE RESORT! DON\u201dT FORGET TO TIP! The nightly entertainment: Boring at best. I\u2019ve seen better high school plays and acts! They really need to do something in this area. My 2 children ages 8 & 10 didn\u2019t like it! Go into Playa and have a ball instead. The resort: This is a place that is pretty laid back. You can walk into the buffet with no shoes or shirt and sit down and eat. If you stay at the Maya that would be unacceptable. Again, the beach is incredible! The entire place is very well maintained and the animals are everywhere including the monkeys. Drinks are good (they will make them as strong as you want\u2026all you have to do is ask and of course like anywhere else on earth a small tip and smile never hurts) and top shelf available in the lobby areas.

I had originally planned to book the Ibeorstar Lindo, but our travel agent recommended the Quetzel. She thought we would like the smaller resort setting and felt the beach at the Quetzel was one of the nicest in Mexico, and as it turns out, she was right on both counts. Our kids got a kick out of all the animals walking around the resort and we felt very comfortable letting them go off to do activities on their own (although we did bring walkie-talkies to keep track of them). The food and service were excellent -make your a la carte restaurant reservations as soon as you arrive especially if you want an early sitting, and the resort was spotless. If you want a non-smoking room, you should request it at the time you make your reservation as we were advised that non-smoking rooms are limited to two bulidings. I would also suggest following an earlier Trip Advisor review and bring along tubes or floats. The guys at the scuba shack are more than happy to blow them up. I would also bring along some cash if you plan to parasail or ride jet skis as they don't take charge. Be sure to negoitate on the parasailing....we paid $100 for three and the folks next to us on the beach paid $125. Jet skis were $35 half-hour. They also give a 10% discount on the scuba diving and snorkel trips if you pay in cash. I would highly recommend taking a day trip to Xel Ha. We booked our trip through Iberoservice located in the hotel lobby. The advantage of using Iberoservice is that they picked up/dropped off at the hotel. If you booked through one of the other travel agencies, the meeting point was a shopping plaza about a 10 minute walk away. Xel Ha had great snorkeling (felt like we were snorking in a big aquarium) and we paid the extra $125 pp to swim with the dolphins (need to make reservations in advance), a truly awesome experience.

They are the closest to the beach and pool. The maids will stock extra water if you give them tips. The Japanese restaraunt was excellent, followed by the steak house. We were there for 5 nights and allowed two reservations with a stand by for the third. I would definitely recommend the Japanese first, steak house second. The Italian restaraunt was terrible. I would rather have eaten at the buffet. The beach at this hotel is incredible, they state you cannot go reserve chairs in the morning but everyone does it. If you want a hut just lay out your towels in the morning, go get breakfast and a cup of coffee and you are ready to go. Beware, there are many topless bathers (not hot bodies, but overweight people). My son was disturbed he is 11 and found it gross. He hung out at the pool after a couple of sightings on the beach.

The wildlife is incredible, they will take pics daily with your children and different animals. Also, the jet skiis are negotiable, they took 40$ for three of us to ride. Do not let them charge you $60.00. Also, the water is filtered at the hotel so it is perfectly safe to brush your teeth with the water. The staff works very hard to please everyone.

Only the items on the top shelf near the back get remotely cool. Our room stayed cool and we only had a few bugs. Bring insect repellant, you will need it outside in the evenings and early mornings. There are no elevators so if you have a lot of gear to haul around or have trouble with stairs, ask for a ground floor room. FOOD: The food was not very good. If you're from the U.S., it was a lot like eating at Hometown Buffet every day. I had a really hard time trying to find something decent that wasn't fried for lunch and the buffet line at the pool is very inefficient. The food was very Americanized. Go out to eat in Playa del Carmen if you want to eat some decent authenic food. DRINKS: Drink beer if you actually want to get a buzz. The frozen mixed drinks have barely any alcohol. Ask them to add more. BEACH: Gorgeous clean beach. Hard to get a spot in the shade unless you get up at 6am and stake out your spot. If you manage to get up that early, you can't get any food or coffee until after 7am. POOL: The pool was VERY warm. It was not refreshing b/c it was so warm. Again, hard to get a spot by the pool unless you wake up EARLY and stake out a chair. We witnessed a few loud arguments between guests who had apparently \"saved\" the same sets of chairs. Also, the pool closes before 7pm, so if you're interested in taking a dip in the evening when its still light outside and has cooled down a bit, you're out of luck. Not sure why they have a hot tub - you can't use it at night and its way too hot to even think of using it during the day. TOWELS: Turn in your wet towels for clean towels at the end of the day.

I literally spent hundreds of hours deciding where to spend my vacation with my husband and 2 children (11 and 14), and booked the Tucan for 8 nights. Ultimately, we stayed at Quetzal, but the two resorts are on in the same. Apparently, Tucan overbooks and sends people to Quetzal, but there is virtually no difference. Here is my take: ROOMS: The Tucan side buildings from beach to lobby are numbered 10-19. The Quetzal bulidings are 20-29, beach to lobby. All of the rooms in 10 and 20 are suites and are ocean front. We requested building 11, second off the beach, and were put in 21. Basically the same thing, but at first we were facing away from the resort toward the adjacent resort... After 4 days we switched to face interiorally towards the pool... and both rooms had views of the ocean, but it was better on the inside. Also, facing the adjacent hotel, their nightly entertainment was VERY loud and rocked our room. So, if you are a night owl, any inside facing building is fine or outside facing on the Tucan side, but if you go to bed before 11:30 or have children, try being in bulidings 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 21, 22, 23 on the inside. Buildings 14-19 and 24-29 will be noisy from Iberostar entertainment... and 26-29 on the outside faces the other hotel's dumpster. It may be worth the extra $55 per night to be ocean facing, but even building 20 could here music. The rooms were very clean and just great. The frig could have been cooler, but otherwise great. If you want to have someone sleep on the sofa, you need to request sheets and a pillow. As long as the balcony door is closed, the room stays nice and cool too. FOOD: I though the food was great... yes the buffet is repeatative, but it was tasty and no one got sick. We went to the Japanese, Italien and Mexican but probably could have gone to more, but chose to eat at the buffet the rest of the nights. Luch is at the two outdoor restaurants close to the beach and breakfast is at the buffet restaurant. If you're an early riser and want a cup of coffe at 6:30, go to the Quetzal side... the Tucam side doesn't seem to open until 7am or later. And the snack bar is open most of the day too, but not until about 10am. DRINKS: We're not big drinkers... I know some people complain about the strength of the drinks, but it depends what you order... The frozen drinks were pretty weak, but that was fine with me. BEACH: Just Beautiful! The palapas do fill up, so I made it a habit to get up at 6:30 amd lay out my towels on my chairs... if you wait til 10am, after breakfast, seats at the pool or in the shade on the beach are hard to come by. There are always lounge chairs and you can get umbrellas from the towel man, but I really liked having the palapa. Some days the water was crystal clear and other days we had some sea weed... that's just mother nature, and the resort raked up the beach. POOL: I'm not much of a pool person in the Caribbean, but the kids enjoyed it. The shallow end was popular... but there were nooks and crannies that were much less crowded. I brough floats from home, and was glad I did, but I could have gotten away with just 1 for my family of 4... and didn't even blow up 2 of the 4 I brought. Never went in the pool with the swim up bar or the activity pool. TOWELS: You get towel cards when you get there, and then you turn them in for your towels at the towels shack... At the end of the day, I'd turn in my wet towels for clean towels so I didn't need to wait for the towel man to arrive, and I'd have towels to lay out at 6:30 in the morning. It was never a problem. WEATHER: We had great weather, but it was hot (June 26-July 4)... the pavement and sand gets hot, so make sure you have flip flops of some footwear for the beach area. EXCURSIONS: We went on 3 excusions: - Swimming with the Dolphins Royal Swim at Dolphin Discovery - Catamaya Catamaran and snorkling - Mayan Adventure Snorkling Tour Plus my husband did 5 scuba trips DOLPHINS: I chose to go to DD because I didn't want to lock myself into a day at Xel-Ha or Xcaret, and I heard the program was slightly better. The price online was $278 for 2 plus we got a $28 coupon for photos, which we bought (the DVD and 2 photos). The kids had a lot of fun. CATAMAYA: A 65' catamaran and we had about 40 people on board... it can accomodate about 100 people, but they only take up to 50. It was a beuatiful boat and a great staff, but the day we went, it was windy and the boat rocked a lot... and the water was stirred up so we saw nothing snorkling, including the reef... In the end, more than half the people felt ill, and I could have passed on this trip. I would only go if I could guarantee good weather. MAYAN ADVENTURE: This is our alternative to the eco parks... Much smaller scale, less people and great snorkling. We went to Akumal lagoon called YaKul and also to a cavern and cenote for snorkling... and cliff jumping. It was super! DIVING: My husband did 3 1-tank dives with Dressel Divers from the hotel and really enjoyed the convenience, and the dive masters... wished that they offered 2-tank dives. Som he also went out with Tank-Ha dive shop in Playa Del Carmen.. This required more effort, needing to take a cab etc. He spent one day diving a cenote dive with Tank-Ha and thought it was great! Tank Ha charged $100 for that dive and Dressel was charging $170... we later found out that Dressel would have matched the price. Oh well.

We were not in the pool very often. It was very nice, but it was very hot just like many other reviewers have said. Our theory was that it was like that because the bottom of the pool is a dark blue and it attracts the sun pretty well. We did go to the adult pool bar a few times, but were completely grossed out when we noticed that we were the only ones who were getting out to use the restroom. We just couldn't get ourselves to go back in there after that! One thing I will tell you to be careful of is the marble floors. There are marble floors in all of the buildings and in your rooms. The first day I slipped and fell right onto my right knee and it is still swollen. The floors tend to get very wet from people walking back from the pool/ocean and it is VERY easy to slip if you do not pay close attention. Warn your children because I am 26 and I bust out crying right there on the floor--IT HURT SO BAD! The food was what you would expect from a buffet. You just have to use common sense when eating. The sour cream was liquified like water from being out in the heat, and butter etc. I never tried to seafood, because it had a very strong aroma I think from the heat. We did eat at the Bonsai (japanese) a la carte and that was very good. It was alot of food. We could not finish it all. We also used room service a few times when we just did not want to go out in the heat, and it was good. Go into the town while you are there if you enjoy shopping. We had a lot of fun looking in all the shops and were able to get some good things at great prices. Also, if you get a chance - get a massage. It was very relaxing.

We were literally drained and in bed every night by 10 because the heat just wiped us out. Even though I had a good time, I don't think I would ever go back during the summer.

My wife and I went to the Iberostar hoping to relax, but with the rowdy behavior of not only the Americans, but the Europeans, this was impossibe. To make matters worse, these ignorant people work the staff to death and never think about rewarding them. So in conclusion, the hotel is nice and the beach is even better, but be prepared for some rowdy drunks and unsupervised kids roaming throughout the resort.", "Date": "June 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cWOW!!!\u201d", "Author": "Misty929", "ReviewID": "UR5377019", "Content": "Wow, where to start!! Let me start by saying that we traveled with our 9 year old daughter to the resort for our family vacation and her birthday. We arrived on 6/18/06 at about 10 am at the hotel. When we drove up you could tell from the moment you stepped out that it was a GREAT hotel. Obviously at that time of the morning our room was not ready just yet, so we changed and headed out to the beach and pool. Originally we were suppose to be in building 26, but Francisco at the front desk was able to put us in Bldg 22 instead. That building is by the pool and only 1 or 2 bldgs from the ocean. In retrospect, we should have taken bldg 26. If you are in a bldg by the pool or ocean you must walk to the front for everything. Not a big deal, but with a 9 year old it became bothersome for her to walk it....lol. They allowed us to check in at 1 pm and then our fun started. The food was good. Breakfast was awesome. You just went down to the buffet for breakfast and everything you could possibly imagine was there to eat. We were there for 4 nights 5 days and only guaranteed 1 reservation at one of the 5 restaurants. We chose the Japanese restaurant called Bonsai. The food was excellent. We chose that one because our daughter was celebrating her birthday that day. We ate at the buffet the rest of the time. They had something different there each night. It was not too boring, and it was good. The pool and beach: The pool is huge. Better get out there early if you want to be in the shade, otherwise lather up with the sunscreen!!! Actually if you can not find a hut on the beach, you can go to the towel hut and get an umbrella you can just pop up in the sand and have shade!! The beach and water were great. The water was not as clear as it was for us in Cancun last year. It appears from all of the photos to be really clear, but it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty darn clear just not as clear as Cancun. Still it was VERY nice. No big waves. It was very relaxing to just float on the water. The rooms are nice, the maids are wonderful. We left like $4 a day for tips and everyday she left some sort of surprise for our daughter. The mini bar is stocked every other day, but if you need any water or anything it is readily available at any of the bars. The beds are like any other in Mexico, hard. But its not that bad, only if you get sunburned!! Entertainment: Oh my goodness what can I say about that? It was great. If you go to this hotel do not miss the main show everynight. They have a different show every night. They start off with kids games and then have a live band and then an adults game show and at about 9:30 the main show starts. Starfriends: Let me say that the starfriends work REALLY hard to make sure that EVERYONE has a great time while staying at this resort. They are amazing how hard they work. We saw Marcos there at 10 am one morning and he was there until midnight that same day. They really have fun doing their job. We even did the limbo til midnight one night......I will save that story for another time. If you get a chance to do the limbo with the starfriends, do it, it is fun. They will make you see how far \"down\" you can go!!! Details are very important to Iberostar. They make sure that they have every little detail covered. It is simply amazing. Oh I almost forgot, the animals. Be prepared to encounter all kinds of animals. They just \"walk\" around the resort. We saw everything from peacocks, iguanas, flamingos, tucans, huge turtles, roosters.......we never saw the monkeys, but we heard them!!! We had a great time at this hotel.

We had a great experience and having stayed at numerous all-inclusives over the years, feel this is one of the better ones. The food was really good for an all-inclusive, even if you do get a little tired of it at the end. The steak house was fabulous and we wished we had made more than one reservation there. The Italian restaurant was a little disappointing. The beach was gorgeous and some of our group really enjoyed the pool and various activities that were offered during the day. We loved all of the wild animals and the jungle atmosphere inside the resort. The drinks were pretty typical of an all-inclusive, in that the liquor seems to be watered down, so we requested doubles quite often. The rooms were nice & our maid did an excellent job of taking care of us during our stay (we did leave a few $ each day). All of the waitstaff and bartenders were extremely friendly and gracious.

Maybe our expectations are not quite so high but we never had any problems or issues at all. Having previously stayed at an IB in the dominican we decided to stick with the chain for our mexico trip and were not disappointed. My experience of the front of house staff was positive. The choice of food is unbelievable in my opinion- the only negative side of our holiday was that there were some rowdy groups of people - who also seemd to be a bit arrogant and inconsiderate for others. As we had booked a junior suite at the Dominican we decided to go for a standard room as we felt that the difference between the 2 was not that great - I didnt go inside the juniors at the Quetzal but our standard room was more than sufficient for 3 of us and was cleaned beautifully every day. We asked the reception to arrange for the room to be cleaned before 1pm each day as sometimes we would take our young daughter back for a nap in the afternoons - and this request was met daily. We also utilised the room service quite a lot for our litlte girl - who loved the chicken nuggets delivered to her - she couldnt believe it. The entertainment team did work really hard and a couple of the shows were above average - but they are - I presume on a low budget - and I found out that they only get paid 13 dollars per day !!!! - most days working 16 hours - I think we should take our hats off to them for trying and working so hard. The pool area was - in my opinion kept immacualte - the pool attendant - worked harder than any one else I have ever seen !!! The speciality restaurants are a welcome change from the buffet - just for a change of scenery if nothing else. The japanese was our favourite. I am sure that there are other hotels in Mexico that are more luxurious but in my opinion we had a terrific holiday and never experienced anything that would put us off going there again", "Date": "June 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Georgetown, Texas", "Title": "\u201cThe Best Iberostar Yet!\u201d", "Author": "UncleTerry", "ReviewID": "UR5349704", "Content": "We stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal from June 1 - 4 ,2006. I must say that it was everything we expected plus a bag of chips! I'm a pretty picky eater but allways found something to good to eat. My favorite was mexican night. We had late dinner reservations at the Japanese steakhouse so I needed a predinner dinner to keep me going. The Pibil was outstanding (kill the cook outstanding for those of you familiar with the \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" movie), the quesdilla's excellent, rice, beans, you name it. Wonderful. Alas, I only got one plate because of fancy dinner reservations later that evening. This brings me to my only complaint. I had to wear long pants to this particular restraunt. I would have been much cooler in short's because there was no airconditioning and you sit right by the teppenyaki grill. The food was really good, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have for being so hot and uncomfortable. We decided to spend the extra money and upgrade our room to beach front. I would definitely do that again. Nothing like having your own patio on the beach.The room was very clean and they repacked our mini bar everyday. The bed was somewhat hard but we've become used to that from several other trips to Mexico. I don't know what it is but regardless of where we stay the beds are hard. Much better showers than those at Iberostar in Cozumel. We used the Hobie Cats and snorkeling gear but there isn't much to see since there isnt a reef in front of the hotel. The beach was nice and wide like those in Cancun with plenty of shade for those who seek it. Playa is a very nice town and has done quite a bit of work to get its shopping district built. I would have liked to been in Playa 15 years ago before all that started. The Funjet folks set us up with a Bar Crawl on friday night. It was definitly a highlight of the trip. We first went to Carlos n' Charlies (Big deal, there's one here in Austin), next was Senior Frogs (been there done that), but the last stop made it worthwhile. The Mambo Cafe was the place to be. An 11 piece Cuban Band hit the stage around midnight and really got the party started. All in all, it was a great vacation.

We are both from England and are in our mid-twenties. The good descriptions of the resort in other reviews are spot on, so I won't repeat them here, but rest assured, I was equally impressed. I spent the first few days at the resort, walking around with a huge smile on my face. You could not fail to be impressed by the beautiful grounds, stunning white sand beech, the tireless effort from the friendly hotel staff and the impressive range of food and mexican beer. After a long flight from England I was up for chilling out on the beach and reading a book for a while and the attentive staff were very accomodating in helping me do just that, regularly bringing me cold beer and coctails. I tried to go easy on the evening buffet at first, but I knew that i was fighting a losing battle. The food was too good and there was an excellent and varied choice that kept me piling up my plate night after night. The bar in the reception area of the hotel was our destination of choice for the evenings and it was quite a cool place to hang out with live music of some description each night. Again, the staff really looked after you and the beer, coctails and wine were going down nicely. It was fortunate that we liked the ambience of this bar as it was the only real place to kick back and enjoy a drink in the evening unless you wanted to endure the live entertainment, which too be honest, was a bit too family orientated and Butlinesque for my tastes. Even so, after a few coctails it was quite comical, in a cringe-worthy kind of way. This lack of places to relax in the evening was in my opinion the only thing that let the resort down. The pool bar and swim-up bar closed early evening so apart from the reception bar and live entertainment, there was nowhere else to go. With such an amazing beach plus the winding pathways through the jungle I felt there was definately some scope for an intimate bar or two that played more easy listening music in relaxed surroundings. The lack of variety at the resort wasn't too much of a problem as the cool little town of Playa Del Carmen was only a $5 taxi ride away and there were a number of excellent bars and restaurants there to suit every taste and we found that the town had a wicked vibe about it despite being a bit of a tourist trap. The obvious downside was that the blue Iberostar wrist bands that worked their magic at the resort were sadly ineffective as payment for food and drinks here. After a number of easy days at the resort we decided to venture out on a few excursions. We opted for the taxi mode of transportation and although it proved to be quite costly getting to destinations, it was very effective and worth every penny as we didn't waste any more time than was needed getting to places. The first place we went too was Porta Adventuras as the rep billed it as the \"Mayan St Tropez\". We stayed all of about twenty minutes as it was the most souless place i have ever been so i won't waste any more time on that place. Snorkelling in Cozumel was also a big let down, but X-Hal was amazing with a wide variety of tropical fish to see and numerous activities set amongst a beautful eco-park. Tulum was worth a visit although it was not a patch on Chitchen Itza. Despite the seven hours in total that you spend on a bus, it would be a sin to come so close and not to visit the ruins of this ancient Myan Community. Back at the resort, the Mexican cuisine countinued to suprise and delight us. If the daytime menu lacked a bit in quality and variation the evening meals in the buffets continued to surpass our expectations. The mexican dishes were outstanding and there was a wide variety of more conventional dishes for those that didn't fancy the local delicacies, although I found myself indulging in both in the same sitting. There were plenty of nice touches, such as the Irish Coffees that were served on an inviting stall at the entrance and the caramalised fruits for desserts. For anyone who likes desserts there was an extensive range in which a great deal of will power was required to refrain from opting for all of them at once. A word of warning though. Now that I am back in England I am constantly hungry and each day is spent waiting for my next fix, which sadly doesn't live up to the food on offer at the resort. The Mayan people working at the resort were genuine, friendly and extremely hardworking and they couldn't have done any more to make our holiday any better. The cleaning staff leave delightful 'towel sculptures' and rose petals on the beds each day and the entertainment staff are engaging and seem to work twenty four hours a day. The staff responsible for the grounds in the resort have done a wonderful job and the place is spottless, even on the beach where empty glasses are retrieved by the staff almost instantly. The reps will tell you that the Mayan people are laid back, but from my experience this can only be taken in a postive context as they bend over backwards to make your stay here as enjoyable as possible. However, I never had any cause to complain so It might have been a different story then. We would definately return to Iberostar Quetzal at some point in the future although I was dissapointed with the lack of places to go for a drink in the evening on the resort. The live entertainment was always well supported , but i suspect that this was down to the lack of credible alternatives and not for the outstanding quality of the shows. Having said that though, if that is your idea of a quality evening of entertainment then you couldn't have gone far wrong.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing quite nights\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5286442", "Content": "I spent 7 days at the Quetzal with 3 friends from college we are ranging 25-27 in age all men. The weather was the worst part because it rained everyday most of the time only for a short period. I will say that the resort itself was nice and very clean. There where some young kids there but they did not have and affect on our experience. The food was decent nothing was very impressive, I definatly recommend eating at the specialty places as much as possible just to change up what you eat. Going off the resort is the only real nightlife you can expierence 5th ave is close by and there you can go to bars, restaurants, shops. Senior Frogs and Carlos and Charlies are located there. More local type bars are also located there and in many cases are a better time. We went into town 3 of the nights we where there not very expensive to either get there or drink there. The beach was very nice and clean also being from Boston, MA we do not have to many nice beaches so it was a nice change. Meeting people our age was not easy but we did manange to meet a some and became friends and hung out together for most of the week (both male and female). Tipping was definalty appreciated but I did not see a difference in service either way so it really is a personal decision. We played 18 holes at the Pariaiso golf course which was very nice but in the heat 18 holes can be very draining (cost about $170 after 2:00pm plus Iberostar pays for the cab ride to and from). In all I would say it was a good do nothing vacation and if you want to do a lot that is also available but you will end up spending mucho dinero!

We have been there with our two daughters, 9 year old. We have never been at all-inclusive resort before as we usually try to do lots of sightseeing, activities, etc when we go on vacation. So we have carefully picked the resort using tips mostly from this website and it did pay off. Few of our comments: Resort grounds: Simply beautiful. Gorgeous tropical landscaping, fountains, waterfalls, tastefully decorated lobby, cafeteria, etc. Winding stone paths from lobby/restaurant areas to the beach and pool areas. Well maintained, clean. The damage from hurricane while still noticeable \u2013 few fallen trees, sparse treetops but \u2013 does not spoil the overall experience in any way. Lots of birds and animals: peacocks, monkeys, lizards \u2013 kids loved it. In the evenings the walkways are lit very nicely, very pleasant to walk around (may need a bug spray though). Rooms: Bit aging but clean and nicely decorated. Average size, double bed room has a couch in addition to bed. Nice (all marble) bathroom with an excellent shower. Ventilation in the bathroom is not great, small fan does not do much. We stayed on a second floor of building 25, on the Quetzal side, facing another resort (Riu Yucatan, was my second choice actually) and we liked the location. The area our room was facing was nicely decorated and it was quiet if you wanted to sit down and relax at the balcony. Small TV, but who cares, used it only to check weather forecasts a couple of times. Air conditioner works well and is not too noisy. Beds are very hard but you can ask to add padding and it helps considerably. We tipped the maid $2 a day and got a different towel creature made every day \u2013 lots of fun for kids. One important detail: on the last day the power went out in the whole area, but seconds later generators kicked in and all lights and a/c powered back up in our resort. No so in Riu Yucatan: they only had pathways lit, but buildings remained dark for hours (I assume no a/c either!). Beach: All you could wish for, clean, wide, sand not very hot, water temperature was just right, very refreshing after you warmed up under the sun (we had around 88-90 degrees with some passing clouds throughout a week). Plenty of empty chairs and while the palapas were all taken by the time we were on a beach (around 10) you can get an umbrella and set it up right next to the water or anywhere you like. There was a constant breeze but waves were not too great so you could always enjoy going into the water. They kept a yellow flag up in the beginning and green one the last couple of days. We walked along the beach either way, it is the widest at this resort a maybe 2 or 3 neighboring ones but gets narrower further north. To the south you have one more resort and then a wild beach and a jungle. Nice walk you want some exercise. Pool: Large, nicely laid out, but quite busy in the morning. If you want a place under palapa you should be out by 9 am (or earlier). This was not a big deal for us as we went to the beach in the morning and only went to the pool for a couple of hours in the afternoon. One warning for families with kids: The pool is deep! Most of it is 5 or 5.5 feet, there is one inlet near the towel station which is 4.5 feet deep. There is also a 1 foot deep kiddy pool for a toddlers. So if you have younger kids who are not good swimmers - beware. I also did not notice any dedicated lifeguards around the pool. This was not a problem for us as my kids smim well and preffered the beach anyway. Food: I can\u2019t really compare it to other resorts as this was our first all-inclusive but we thought it was pretty good, there is enough variety for a weeklong vacation. Certain foods were not as good as others but I think most people would find something to their taste. We usually had our breakfast at the main dining buffet on either side of resort (large variety of foods) and lunch at one of the big palapa restaurants near the beach. We had 3 guaranteed dinner reservations to a la carte restaurants with our package and got one more from the waiting list. We liked Italian restaurant the best, steakhouse was pretty good too. Staff/ Service. Very good. Our reservation was lost but resort administration handled it very good. They contacted cheapcarebbean.com and confirmed that is was paid, gave us the room and took care of the rest. Service people are very friendly and helpful. Drink service on a beach is slow but a bar is just a short walk away and you can get your drink (or ice-cream!) faster this way. Drink service around the pool is better but still slow. In the restaurants the service was mostly good. Can\u2019t comment about their entertainment as we did not stay long for their shows. We were usually tired by the end of the day that we went to bed early. Did a few trips: whole day to Xcaret, half a day to Tulum. I thought Xcaret was overpriced for what it had to offer, but kids enjoyed dolphin swim ($115 dollars per person) and had fun snorkeling in the lagoon. Their evening show was nice, a bit loud at the end, but good, especially the first part with the Mayan ball games. For water activities Xel-Ha may be a better deal. Tulum trip is ok if you interested in archeology, but you could see the ruins in 1 hour and it takes an hour each way to get there from Play del Carmen. You can take some really nice pictures there though as the coastline is very picturesque. As a change from the daily routine it is ok. Not expensive either if you take a bus from Playa del Carmen, only about $3 per adult one way, half price for kids. And taxi ride to Playa is only 50 pesos or $5 from the resort. You could also walk from resort through Playacar to downtown Playa, it is about 30 min walk, mostly nice near resorts and expensive condos and houses. I took a bike tour from the resort to 5th ave in Playa, nice but hot, don\u2019t forget water if you go. Overall we had a very good experience at Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal.

It is a beautiful place, with a kick-butt beach and lovely grounds. The staff are really nice and attentive. The down sides: the resort can be noisy. The pool closes early. Don't you dare get hungry between 5 and 6:30pm. FOOD: The food at the buffet is quite good. We got a litlte bored of the selections, but after a week, anyone would get bored of the selections, no matter how good. The mexican restaurant was fabulous. The japanese was so-so. However, if you get hungry between 5pm and 6:30pm - no food for you. All the restaurants are shut down. A source of great frustration to a hungry girl like me, on several occassions. You can order from the limited room service menu, if in dire straits. THE BEACH: awesome! We never had a problem finding a palapa, no matter what time we dragged our lazy butts down to the beach. Granted, it was cloudy and threatening to rain the ENTIRE time we were there (boo-hoo for us!) so our experience may have been different if it had been sunny and warm. ROOMS: We stayed in building 22. The rooms are spacious and very comfortable. The all marble bathroom was a delight. The photos on the website do not do them justice. We got super-cute little towel animals along with flower petals on our bed every day. It's a small thing, but I loved it. However, the cheesy entertainment booms across the front half of the resort. We purposely booked our rooms far away to avoid the noise, but we were caught in the equally loud noise from the resort right next door! We were getting up at 7am to go diving and such, and couldn't sleep until after 11pm when the entertainment next door finally wound down. I know I sound like a cry-baby for complaining about it, but it really did affect our vacation. ENTERTAINMENT: As you can guess from my comment above, I found the entertainment to be unbearable. I guess that makes me a snob though, because the room where it was held was commonly full of people. None of them seemed too excited about it (no dancing, etc.) but there were all there. It could have been because there was no where else to go. More on that below... POOL: The pool is lovely and a great temperature. However, it closes down around 6pm (or so we were told). No swimming after dark. The pool bar is separate from the rest of the pool. It has it's own lovely little grotto, complete with waterfall. However, it closes early too. And being separate, and adults only, made it feel like you were walking into some kind of dirty little area for bad boys and girls (and not in a good way). It made me want to get out of there, pronto. One of my favourite parts of all-inclusive resorts is floating in the pool with a margarita in hand. It is not really possible here. Which is why I think that everyone was in the entertainment area (bored senseless). BARS: the lounge in the reception area is the best - and the only place to go at night, apart from the entertainment area which we avoided like the plague. Ask for it, and they will get you dark beer (cerveza negra, per favor!). We never made it to Mascara (the on-site nightclub) so I can't comment. ATTRACTIONS: Playa is a pretty little town. Definitely go to Alux - a restaurant/bar built into some local caves. It's just too cool. You have to walk down Avenida 5, but don't expect too much: it's a giant tourist trap. Sometimes that can be fun, though - lots of bars, places to eat, entertainment, etc. We went diving in Cozumel. It was lovely and worth the ferry trip over. The town is nothing much. We went diving in the cenotes - a unique experience that I highly recommend (you can snorkel too). We went to Tulum - lovely but very touristy. We also made the trip out to Coba (couldn't make it all the way to Chichen Itza) and it was fantastic. You can rent bikes to cover the large grounds and see the amazing ruins. We climbed an eight storey tall pyramid (yikes!). We rented a car to do all these things, and despite the stress of driving on the Mexican highways, I think it was worthwhile because we were able to make our own schedule. All in all, we had a great vacation. This area of Mexico has a lot to offer. The resort was lovely, as far as these kinds of resorts go. I personally did not find it relaxing, and won't be going back but I think that's partly because I'm just not a resort kind of person. I much preferred getting off the beaten track (even just a little bit) and I had lots of opportunities to do that - which made it a fabulous trip.", "Date": "May 29, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brighton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cHeaven\u201d", "Author": "panda02", "ReviewID": "UR5231536", "Content": "We returned from a 2 week stay at The Iberostar Quetzal/ Tucan in Feb this year. I couldn't fault the hotel, and all the fantastic things previous posts have said are absolutely true, it was jaw droppingly amazingly fantastic!!!! We wandered about for our entire saying 'Oh my God, look at that!' The hotel is a perfect size, not too big and easy to get about, but with plenty of space so it never felt crowded. The beach was the most relaxing place ever, we were happy to lay there for hours at a time, unheard of for us. I wont repeat what everyone else has said, but I want to warn people not to take the 'upgrade' they may be offered to another Iberostar hotel. They do this when they're overbooked, it's cheaper to send existing guests to an 'upgrade' for a few days than to send new guests to an upgrade for their entire stay. We were tempted and went for it, and completely spoilt the last few days of our holiday. We left at 9 am as we were assured our room would be ready, went in the complimentary taxi to the Lindo/Maya, only to be told our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm, and we had to wait around reception with our cases all day. A whole day wasted. When we finally got it, the room certainly was top class, but we then realised the enormity of this hotel. It took forever to get anywhere, 20 minutes for us to walk to the buffet from our room (don't leave without your map, you WILL get lost!) Suffice to say, the Quetzal/Tucan, although a slightly lesser star rating, is by far the better hotel, we would actually pay more to stay there than at the Maya/Lindo. And everyone else we spoke to that took the upgrade felt exactly the same. You have been warned!! We got married in Cancun while we were there (if you're thinking of doing the same, contact Sharon Van Bramer at (--)....she is amazing and gave us the most beautiful, romantic, perfect wedding that we could ever have hoped for), we went to Xcaret, a fab day out (if you go you MUST stay for the evening show, not our thing but we took others advice and were so glad we did, it was magical), quad biking at ATVexplorer just down the road - WOW!!!!!!!! (cheaper and better than the one we bought through Iberostar in the lobby) you can book before you go at (--), it's just a few dollars by taxi (taxi rank just inside hotel gates) and they'll pick you up too. We booked some trips before we left through (--), highly recommended and great personal service. I could go on all day!! Happy to answer any questions. My last piece of advice.....STOP DITHERING AND BOOK IT!!

We were a party of 3 women in our mid 30s. General: The hotel itself was very nice; the grounds were beautiful and very clean. We walked through some other properties down the beach and none were as attractive as ours. Our trip started off on a negative note, since the airline (US Air) lost our luggage, but we did not let that get us down. We filled out a form at the airport and were told our luggage would be delivered by 1:00 the next day, so we proceeded on to the hotel. Upon arrival they tried to put us in building 29, which is right across from the lobby. After a little negotiation, and the fact my cousin had a cast on her foot, we were able to score a room in building 21 right near the pool. Room: The room was nice. The AC and the fridge didn't work all that well, but we managed. The maid was very nice. We left tips daily and received more water and beer than we could drink! (not complaining about that!) The beds were hard, but I liked them and slept very well. We could hear the noise from the RUI hotel next store until about 11:30, but it never kept us up. We could see the ocean from our balcony, which was a nice perk. Pool/Beach: The pool was very large but like others have said, you did need to be out there early to get a chair. I was up most mornings b/f 7:30 to reserve our chairs w/a hut. We brought floats from home, which I would recommend, and had the scuba guys blow them up for us. It was so relaxing to just float around all day. Be careful of the sun though, both my companions got badly burnt on the 1st day due to not reapplying sun block after swimming. The beach was beautiful, but the red flag was us the whole time we were there, so we tended to stay at the pool, which was easier for swimming. I did however take morning walks down the beach and noticed that our beach was one of the nicest on the strip. Some others had large sand bags from where they were eroded from the hurricane. Activities: The activities during the day were great. There was always something going on if you wanted to participate. However, they were lacking in the evening activities. There were the nightly shows, but they got old quick. It would have been nice to have some decent entertainment in the lounge. They had a guitar player one night, but he was really BAD! The Disco opened at 10:30-11, but that never really got to crowded. Needless to say, we were in bed most nights b/t 10-11:00, but after spending all day in the sun, we were wiped out anyway! Food: The food was decent. We ate at the buffet most of the time which was OK. You could always find something to eat, but it was usually the same thing, pizza, french fries, chips, hamburger, salad, etc. We tried the Japanese and the Italian restaurants. The Japanese was very good, but the Italian was bad. I know this is against most others on this site, but all three of our dinners were terrible. The pasta was better at the buffet than at the Italian restaurant. Overall we had an excellent vacation, very relaxing. I would recommend this hotel to others. Just be warned that if you are a night person, you may find it a little boring, otherwise you will love it!

I enjoy the information this service provides so here are some details for individuals to know about the Oberostar Quetzal Resort on the Riviera Maya in Mexico. First the good news. The service at this resort is great. The people are very friendly and the resort itself is beautiful. All the wildlife is just great. The rooms are modest but they have large walk in showers and are clean. The bed was hard but not that bad. I did enjoy the large pool and could always find a sun chair. Thera are quit a few people at this resort. I did hear that they are about 85% full year round. American, Mexican, and European crowd here. Now the bad new. The food and drinks at this place were not very good. They made alot of drinks with cheap mexican booze and did not offer any top shelf liquor. I was really forced to only drink beer. To me a tropical drink made with cheap booze is not worth drinking. The main bar near the lobby did have Bacardi Rum but you had to request it. The bars by the pool only had rock gut cheap drinks. The food was a 4 on the 10 scale. They did not offer any green leaf lettuce and fresh vegetables and the menu did not change much. In general the food seemed like it had been frozen before you ate it. This was the same for the resturants as well. Now I have been to other all-inclusive resorts before (Club Med, Sandals) and this place in the area of food does not hold a candle to them. Another thing to know is that there is really no happy hour place to gather at this place. They had a bar in a small pool but not a place on the ocean where you could gather to enjoy a drink and listen to live music. That is a change that would be nice. The price of this resort is nice but looking back now I wish I would have spent more because some things like drinks and food do make a difference.

I am 18 years old, and there were 11 of us total in our group. For the past 4 years we have been the the Iberostar Bavaro in the Dominican Republic which is awesome, but we decided to try someplace new this year...sticking with an iberostar.To start out, our vacation was totally awesome. Thank you Catalina for your help before we even got to the hotel. Grounds: The grounds were stunning. There was every kind of animal you could think of roaming freely. Peacocks, flamingos,monkeys,iguanas, etc. Everything was spotless and the staff were always cleaning and trimming the grounds. The jungle was very fun to walk through as well. Staff: The staff was very helpful and friendly. They always had a smile on their face, and many of them remember you through the week. The servers and bartenders were always happy to serve you--, Jose Nacional(?), Aroldo, Marcos,Jeremias,Henry, and many more. They are always happy and work incredibley hard for us...we would always tip at the restaurants and give the bartenders a dollar here and there as they very much deserve that. Now for the Starfriends, they were awesome!...They were up eating breakfast with us at the buffet at 9 in the morning and were doing activities all day by the pool and beach, and then they put on like 2 shows each night, and then we would be in the disco and the starfriends were there as well....I cannot believe how hard they work and they are really what makes the vacation so nice. Special thanks to Luis, Ruben, Angelo, Fabio, Jesus(?) and Catalina. Also the guys who run the watersports(snorkeling and sailboats,etc.) near the dressel diver area were great!! I miss everyone so much, I should have tried to get some of their email addresses. Beach: The beach was gorgeous. The water was so blue and clear. Little to no seaweed at all...no rocks and it was very clean. The beach was a bit wavy at times but we enjoyed it....also perfect temperature. The sand was white and clean. There are servers who walk around the beach during the day who will get you drinks...they work hard and we would tip them a few dollars every day. We had 2 beach parties while we were there and they were a lot of fun!! There was dancing with the starfriends and the starband and they had paella at the one and the second one they had these kabob things... i highly suggest you dont miss out!! Pool: The pool here is very big....its very nice. I would only say that the pool water was a bit too warm for my liking as i like it to be cooler and more refreshing. My friend and i took the scuba lessons in the pool which were very fun! they also have dancing near the pool and water aerobics evey day. They also have an adult pool (18+) with a swim up bar and waterfall...very nice. Food: For breakfast there was the main buffet that we had every morning. It ended at 10am and you could get waffles, omlettes,eggs,pancakes, etc. For lunch we ate around the pool area they had different stuff..hot dogs, hamburgers, nachos, chicken, pasta, salads and so on. There was ice cream at the beach bar and also softserve ice cream at the bar where you could get lunch. For dinnerwe tried 3 specialty restaurants and also we at at the buffet for the rest fo the time. The buffet seemed to have a theme every night and had some of the food based on that...they also had regular food like baked chicken which was very good and pastas, etc. I am a picky eater while im on vacation just because i dont want to try new foods im not used to and wind up getting sick, and there was still enough variety for me to get filled up. We tried the italian restaurant (La G\u00f3ndola) and it was pretty good. They had pastas with red tomato sauce, fetuccine alfredo, veal and other stuff. Our 2nd dinner reservation was at the steakhouse(La Marimba) We had a fun time here. The steak was excellent and you could also get ribs which were delicious. They brought out a blooming onion for an appetizer. After dinner we all did a round of shots (POPPERS!!) with Marcos (Awesome) Our last reservation was for the Japanese (Bonsai). This was quite the experience. You get to sit around the chef and watch him prepare your meal. It was very tasty and the dessert was excellent!! We really enjoyed dinner here. Nightlife: We went to the shows every night which started at 9-930. There were some shows that were done with the help of the audience and some that the starfriends did. The shows here were VERY good. I would say way better then the ones we saw in the Dominican. The performers and dancers work so hard and they really do a great job. After the shows they do the 2 dances every night \"Dale Pa'lla\" and Hey Baby\" its very fun if you participate and go up and learn the dances!!...The disco starts at 11 and goes until 3am. It wasnt very packed...a few nights there were more people than other nights...we still had a lot of fun...the bartenders were great at the disco!! Shopping: We went into Playa Del Carmen by the taxi and paid $5 US. its about a 5 minute ride and the shops were a lot of fun. You must bargain with them and the stuff is not very expensive. I suggest you go here for the shopping. We went twice during the week...its safe so dont get discouraged leaving your hotel grounds. My friend and i walked around alone here while my parents went a different direction and we are only 18 and never had a problem. All in all, we all had an excellent time. Our room was in building 21 and was perfect. I dont understand how people can complain about this hotel, i guess some people are hard to please. We travel a lot and have been to several all-inclusives and this is one of the top ones.

The resort was just beautiful. The transfer from the airport was seamless. In no time we were on the beach enjoying a cold beverage. The staff was fantastic! I never seen so many smiling faces and a willingness to please. The food was very good / the Italian was our favorite - although we did not go to the Japanese which everyone raves about. The room was nice sized and I kinda miss the beds there! I haven't slept well since returning home! The beach was amazing. although I should warn you that there are many topless women there - it's allowed at the beach but not in the pool area. I really enjoyed all the wildlife roaming about. The MONKEYS were hilarious to watch and the flamingos, parrots,turtles, iguanas, peacocks & Tucan were great! The only bad thing to report was a side trip that was recommended by our Funjet on-site rep. It was a scuba \"discovery\" trip off-site at a local marina. I had never scuba-ed - so I thought a one-day learning excursion would be perfect. I ended up spending almost 8 hours off the hotel site alone (my husband was golfing that day.) I waited almost 2 hours for someone to show up and after only a few brief minutes of \"instruction\" I had to wait a couple more hours for another actual dive - everyone was certified but me - and to make a long story short - I couldn't keep up with the ceritified divers - so they made me return to the boat! I spent over $100 US in this day trip and all I got was about 10 minutes in the water and a broken blood vessel in my eye (someone said it was because I didn't pressurize properly)- Scuba should not be learned in this manner - I found out the hard way! If you want to scuba - ceritify first under controlled conditions. The Loomas company said I would get a refund - but I'm not holding my breath - no pun intended!

The grounds at this hotel were like no other hotel i've stayed at before. They were beautiful, very clean, spacious, and well manicured. It took us a few days to get used to all the wildlife we encountered (peacocks, monkeys, rodentlike things, lizards, ect...) walking to and from our rooms, but it was quite entertaining by mid week. The beach seemed to be the best on the strip, there was always plenty of chairs and alot of room. The food was not the greatest, but I never really have high expectations on food at an all inclusive if i had to pick a favorite it would have to be the Italian Resturant. We did speak to some people who had stayed at the Quetzal before and they all told us that the food was not what it used to be. Our room was fine we didn't mind the beds (probably because we did not sleep too much) & the shower was great. Most of the staff was freindly especially the activities personel. We did take a taxi into town every night around 12:00am that was a blast! We tried out a few bars but we found the Blue Parrot to be our favorite, it seemed to be the most busy and stayed open until 4am........which means we would stroll in around 7am, shower and hit the beach for the day.

After reading so many great reviews, I think my expectations might have been a little too high because overall we were a little disappointed with the hotel. I really can't complain too much b/c, let's face it, vacation in itself is a beautiful thing, right? Not having to work, R&R, the beach, the sun...it was all wonderful! But, I know that I relied very heavily on Tripadvisor when I planned this vacation so I hope I can return the favor to anyone thinking of going to this resort. To start from the beginning, upon arrival at the Cancun airport, make sure that you stop for no one. Go straight until you reach the parking lot. There you can find your travel coordinator or look for a taxi. Stop for no one while inside the airport. There are so many people screaming at you to take your bags or trying to scam you in to seeing time sharing. Check-in for us was bad. We arrived late in the afternoon and although I followed another reviewers advice and sent an e-mail ahead to the resort to reserve a king bed in a certain building...it didn't help b/c I was told there was only one king room left up near the lobby. We had no choice but to take it. Luckily noise was never an issue even though we were somewhat close to the disco. Needless to say, we had no view. I did get the mattress pad though and we slept fine. Yes, the frig is supposed to be restocked every other day. That was not the case for us. By the third day when it hadn't been restocked we had to call to ask for more water and Sprite. Also, our toilet had problems flushing off and on during the week. Oh, and our safe was locked shut when we went to use it for the first time and they had to send security to open it for us. The water pressure in the shower was excellent. The food was medicore at best. There is no variety. It is the same thing day after day. We ate at the Steakhouse, Japanese and Mexican restaurants on property. They were good and much better than the buffet. You won't gain weight eating the desserts b/c they were terrible. We went out to eat twice in PDC. We ate at La Parilla and that was good. We spoke to other people that had been back to this hotel and they said that the food quality had definitely gone down and that the level of service wasn't the same. We were relieved to hear that because we thought we were just turning in to snobs. The beach is great. Had no problem getting chairs. The beach is the best along the strip of hotels in Playacar. The pool was nice, but very hard to find a chair there. Need to be out by the pool by about 8:30 am if you want chaird. Even though they tell you you can't reserve chairs EVERYONE does it especially by the pool. We are beach people so we didn't care. For activities we went to Dolphin Discovery and did the Royal Swim and it was fabulous. I better stop here. I could go on and on, but I am really getting too long winded. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. All-in-all we had a great vacation, but I would not go back to this resort unless I heard that the food quality greatly improved.

I had read more reviews about the Tucan side of the hotel so was disappointed that first night to be put on the Quetzal side. However after the first day of walking around I realized I really liked where we were. We stayed on the ground floor of building 25, facing the jungle. It was central to both the beach area and the lobby & restaurants. The hotel is really one big resort with two receptions & lobbies. We had a daily show of peacocks, peahens, those cute little rodent critters & monkeys in front of our balcony. Buffets were just fine...there was something there for everyone. Not being a connoisseur of fine food like some of the reviewers obviously must be, I was quite happy with the food and happy to be able to get something when I was hungry. The speciality restaurants were a nice change as you get waited on. I think my favorite was the Italian..very romantica! We had a drink before dinner every night in the lobby bar. The lobby bar on the Tucan side seemed to be the party bar, but we preferred the Quetzal bar. I thoroughly enjoyed my daily adhoc spanish lessons with the young man at the towel booth. I was up every morning & on the beach by 0800. There were palapas available as well as tons of beach chairs. We spent most of our time on the beach with an umbrella obtained from the towel booth. Unless you are a dedicated sun worshipper you need some shade, because when the breeze/wind off the ocean stops, it is hot!! We brought our own air mattresses but didn't use them that much as the waves many of the days were quite big. Next time I will bring an inner tube which you can hang onto better. There are ladies that will serve you drinks on the beach and pick up the empty cups. They discourage bringing plates of food down to the beach and I can see why, as people left them lying around for some one else to clean up after. I don't mean to lecture: there are garbage cans scattered about, so clean up after yourself & your kids, as there is no magic machine that comes along at night to clean up the mess of us tourists. If you are a smoker, (which I am) please get a styrofoam cup from the buffet, fill with sand & use as your ashtray. Then throw it away at the end of your day. I am not normally affected by bugs however in the lobby bar I found I was getting bitten by something?? yet my husband wasn't. I didn't see any mosquitoes?? So I bought some bug spray and I was fine when I used it, so you might want to pack some. There is a small plaza a 5 minute walk down the street that has a drug store of sorts so you can pick up stuff there. If you are really adventurous you can go into Playa and go to Wal-Mart..the prices there are less expensive of course. My husband scuba dives and did 6 days/12 dives from a shop in Playa on Quattro Norte off of 5th, called Scuba Libre. Great package deals and an experienced dive team. This was our 2nd stay in an Iberostar and we are very impressed with this hotel chain. Tucan/Quetzal we really loved due to it's closeness to Playa. One last thing..you don't need to do this every interaction, but don't forget to tip..10-20 pesos($1-2) or more here & there is a pittance for the smiling, friendly & hard working service you get from all the staff.

The resorts appearance was impressive with a tropical feel. The service and accomodations were excellent. The thached roofs of the common areas with the polished marble floors give an impressive appearance. As mentioned before in the reviews the beds are hard and pillows flat. I'd recommend asking for the mattress pads and extra pillows. Cruise food I believe was better. They try hard and at the buffet one night the head chef stopped at our table to ask for suggestions. They aim to please. We tried the Mexican, Italian & Japanese ala carte restaurants and all were very good. Everyone should be able to find something at the buffets. Entertainment was just fair but the Star friends try extremely hard. I enjoy the cruise entertainment especially the comedians. Fabio is still at the resort. You'll know what I'm talking about if you've been to the Quetzal/Tucan. I preferred the Quetzal's feel over the Tucan's. An example is the resort background at the buffet restaurants.

Plan to enjoy lunch every day down by the pool and the beach. There is no finer view in Playa! 5. Bring a stack of $1 bills...you will want to tip the wonderful staff, bartenders, bellhop, etc. Travelers desire different things in a vacation, but you will love the wide, clean beach, the tasty food, the comfortable rooms, and the pleasant, attentive staff.

At first, we were bummed about this - but it turned out to be a very quiet part of the resort. The room was nice - VERY hard beds and pillows. I think this is a common complaint in Mexico. It did not bother us too much, but my wife was happy she brought her own pillow. The room was clean and the refrigerator kept well stocked. I tipped the maid and bartenders - and got excellent service. The bars were nice - top shelf liquor etc. Bartenders mixed whatever you wanted - and did not skimp on the booze!! They also had some fun new drinks to try each day. My wife discovered the Electric Lemonade - very good. Our only complaint was the food. The buffets were good, but the food was essentially the same for all meals. The breakfasts were good with made to order omelets, omelets etc - but many of the dishes carried over from there to lunch. Lunch and dinner buffets were pretty much the same. We did not realize that you were only given 1 reservation to a non-buffet restaraunt with a 4 night stay. So - the last night, we went to Playa and had dinner there. We found a great place - with the help of our Lomas Travel Rep - food was excellent. Playa is beautiful - we will go back there for sure.

There was the usual annoying sunbed hogging but we are resigned to this in Europe - It ends up being a case of if you can't beat 'em join 'em sadly and against our better nature. I did have a little fantasy about taking all the towels etc off the beds and chucking them in the pool on the last day but managed to restrain myself!

Also, during the day, the kiddy section of the Rui Resort was right outside our door, so we got to hear every game they were playing, whisltes blowing, kids screaming constantly..... not a huge deal, but when you want an hour before dinner to just sit on your balcony, have a beer in relative peace...forget it.

I proposed to my girlfriend on the beach the very first night of our trip (she did say yes). we are now planning our wedding there. There really isnt anything bad i can say about this place. The only thing that people may get sick of is the food. The food is a little bland and repetitive, but thats what you get in a all inclusive. The grounds are emaculatly clean. The staff works very hard to keep it this way. the jungle definaltly thined out with Emily coming through. i noticed a huge differnce from the 04 visit to the 05 visit.

They are by far the best showers i have ever been in. i'm not sure if its because, its so hot down there in August or if i just really enjoy showers. The beds. Well, if you have problems sleeping, because, \"the beds are hard\" then your not doing anything during the day. Trust me you will sleep. The beach is the best at night. Its so peaceful and romantic. Its the reason you go on vacation. close your eyes and picture yourself on the beach at night, the only noise you can hear is the ocean crashing on the shore and the brisk breeze, whistling by your ears. you look up and you can see every star you never thought exsisted. you look out into the ocean and there in the distance is the glow of the island of Cozumel. its great!!!! during the day is just as nice.

We stayed the week or 1/6-1/13/06. When we checked in we were told the resort was at capacity. We were concerned upon hearing this but I can assure you we NEVER felt crowded in any way - we often commented on where all the people were. Check-in: We`arrived a bit early for check-in so they told us to have a drink at the bar and walk around a bit. While sitting at the bar, the person working the reception desk came over and said our room was ready - we waited a total of 15 minutes. We gave him our travel papers from Funjet and we were on our way to our room in a matter of moments. We were driven to our building in a cart and the bags also taken into our room. Room: We stayed in the lower level of building #26. It is very close to the buffet & bars...just a small walk to the pool & beach. The room was nothing special but i didn't have any plans on doing anything other than sleeping in there. It was very clean and the person who kept it tidy did an excellent job - we tipped a few $ every day and were left with towel art every evening. The air worked well, some lights were not working (I could care less), the shower was very large, plenty of towels. If you plan on going to bed early, this building is near the entertainment in the evening...shows usually last till around 11:30ish - again no problem for us. The mini-refridge was stocked daily. Gym: Small with a few free weights, bikes & treadmills. SPA: We had a couples massage - excellent. I think it was $40US per person for 50 minutes. Internet: $2US for 15 minutes. I emailed the family & checked the weather forecast - that's about it. Pool: We ventured into the pool bar & it was VERY cold! Watch out and don't go any further than the blue dots in the bottom of the pool! The dropoff comes as a quick & cold surprise. There was a group of people sitting by the bar that had a good laugh at everyone who took too many steps - fun was had by all. The pool was a bit cold for us so we just sat by the ocean all day. Here's a tip, the bubbling area in the middle of the main pool is not a hot tub. From the looks of it, there were always open lounge chairs available if we wanted to sit by the pool. Beach: Excellent & very large. We never had a problem finding a lounge at any time. There were a few toppless women there every day - no problem for us. If you think your kids are gonna freak, keep them by the pool. We walked the beach as far north as we could and south for a while. From the looks, the beach here was a lot less crowded than any other resort! If you want a very quiet area, take a walk south past the rocks on the beach. Food: The buffet was very good an we always found something to eat every time we ate there. We ate at the Italian, Japanese & Tropical restaurants and found them to be very good as well. Bars: I think the strength of our drinks varied from bar to bar & the time of day. After day one, I stuck to the \"dirty monkey\" and shots of tequila (ask for something that is 100% agave)...my wife drank the rum punch. The bartenders have no problem adding a bit more booze to your drink. Say hello to Miguel at the bar near the entertainment area...every night when he saw us walking up he had our drinks ready. Resort Atmosphere: If you don't like being around various animals you should probably stay somewhere else. There are gekos, iguanas, large rodent type animals, peacocks, monkeys, ducks, cats & birds all over the place. Our first morning we were awoken at 5AM by the monkeys and shortly after the peacocks kicked in. I could care less about these things and figured they were all a part of my Mexico experience. The walkways are all cobblestone so we suggest some shoes for the walks to the beach. Kids: I was surprised to see kids of all ages during this time of year. We didn't find any to be overly obnoxious in any way. Entertainment: The Star Friends do a performance every evening. The shows all revolve around singing, dancing and involve audience participation on some evenings. The disco doesn't get going till late in the evening. Downtown Playa: The cab into Playa is $5US and well worth the trip in. If you don't want to be hassled by the shop keepers, go in the evening. We walked all of 5th Ave. and ventured down the sidestreets off the beaten path. We found when we traveled up the streets and further off the main, the deals were better. We purchased some beautful leather artwork from a small shop on 15th - we found nothing similar during our travels in Mexico. As far as tequila selection, I was looking for bottles I could not find in WI. A bartender at the Tequila Barrel suggested I go to \"Covi\" to make my purchases, being buzzed from several drinks I jumped in a cab and set off. Nobody at Covi spoke English but after a few moments struggling to help each other out I made a purchase of a few bottles & found them to be much cheaper than on 5th Ave. Weather: Mid-80's every day. Some rain but we were in downtown Playa so I sat and had some drinks and food - who cares? Hurricane damage: There are resorts down the block that had there beach areas wiped out but the looked rebuilt. Some building north of the Quetzal are damaged and are in the process of also being rebuilt. We talked with someone who stayed at the Quetzal a few times and he noted that the trees were stripped and there was usually more of a canopy. this being our first time, I wouldn't have noticed any damage had I not seen the beach & buildings up the beach.

We never had a problem getting a reservation for the specialty restaurants and could have eaten at one for dinner each night (we stayed for 7 nights). The buffet for breakfast and lunch always had lots of variety but is catered towards European pallettes, mainly German. They had the most delicious ice cream I have ever tasted! The staff at the buffet was slightly less reliable but still great. I am a pastry chef and I would say that the food was great, not 4 or 5 star, but great. It is not gourmet cuisine but it is good food. 4. The pool was really, really big. My husband and I noticed that some chairs were reserved early in the day but we could always find a set of chairs, although we preferred beach lounging to the laying by the pool. 5. The rooms were kept perfectly clean. The floors are stone and there was never sand or anything after the maid was through. Our mini-fridge was kept stocked with whatever we needed. Lowlights: 1. The beds are REALLY hard. I read this before we left but honestly, by the end of the vacation, we would get up early just to get out of bed because we would be so sore. The only other lower point we had was a trip to Chichenitza. If you go, just be prepared to take a 3 1/2 hour busride there, be there for 2 hours and drive 3 1/2 hours home. It is a really long day. We also went to Xel Ha and it is AMAZING!! GO GO GO!! It is totally worth it. As far as Montezuma's Revenge goes, my husband and I both would take Pepto Bismol tablets before each meal and we never got sick from eating at the resort. The only time we felt queezy was after eating at Xel Ha, they probably just aren't as careful as the Iberostar.

My cousin was married on the beach and it was beautiful. The staff was helpful and polite and the grounds were perfectly maintained. I will not reiterate all the other comments about the cleanliness, scenic grounds, the jungle, staff-they were all excellent but will add a few comments in these catagories: Weddings: If you attend a wedding make sure you wear a cool dress and don't bother bringing high heels. The ceremonies are on the beach and in Oct at 4:00 it was 95. Sweat stained silk dresses did not look attractive in the wedding album. Also the walkways from the rooms through the jungle and in hotel were slick, uneven and the wood planking had gaps which were not conductive to walking in high heels-bring comfortable shoes. Meals: If you stay 4 nights they guarantee only 1 reservation at one of the five restaurants and if you stay 7 nights they only guarantee 3 reservations. Make your reservation the first day you arrive and they put yourself on the waitlist for the other nights. Most of the time you will get in on a waitlist. (Although tipping is not expected it is appreciated and it may help you get into the restaurant of your choice.) The buffet is fine but the restaurants were better and it is nice to do both. The breakfast buffet at pool is cooler (ocean breeze) and closer if your rooms are 2500-2000 but the breakfast buffet near the lobby has more variety(pancakes and waffles in addition to eggs etc). Rooms: We booked a standard room through funjet but upgraded to an oceanfront junior suite ($50 extra/night/room). We were 3 in the room so it was well worth it. The room is only slightly larger and has 2 couches/daybeds instead of one but the oceanfront view was certainly worth it. Activities: We went snorkeling ($26 cash, $29 cc) which was great. Plenty of tropical fish, 10 minute boat ride-45 min snorkel, 2 guides, near xcarat. You could walk down the beach (about a 2 mile walk) to the same reef and use the free snorkel equipment but in the heat the ride was worth it. Non motorized activities-wind surfing, hobie cat, kayak, snorkel are free. We had a great time on the hobie cats (if you don't know how to sail or windsurf they suggest a lesson $39 and if don't take a lesson and need to be rescued they charge you $39). We have a sailboat at home so it wasn't a problem but there were definetly some people that could have used some help. Beach/Pool: The ocean is beautiful but there was a decent rip current so don't think you can let small children or non swimmers go in alone. The pools close by 7:00 pm which I thought was pretty early. Entertainment: The Starfriends (the group of 20-30 year olds who ran the day activities-aerobics, salsa, bike tours, kids programs as well as the night time entertainment) were friendly and fun. The shows were alittle hokey but they did them very tongue in cheek. There was a different show every night. 8:30-9:45 was a kids oriented show and 9:45-10:45 a musical review. After that they would all go over to the disco and get everyone dancing. I was especially impressed with how kind they were to two of the guests attending my cousins wedding. Both were in their 30's and had developmental delays -downs syndrome. The Starfriends went out of their way to include them in all activities/shows and took them back stage and danced with them at the discos etc. They were all very good looking and certainly had their pick of young good looking guests who wanted to dance with them but every night went out of their way to include them and talk to them. Overall we had a great time, great wedding and I would highly recommend staying here.

We have traveled many times to mexico, and have been to playa del carmen 5 years ago. First of all Playa del carmen has changed alot. No longer is it the great unknown vacation spot, with its small little town. It was alittle sad for us to see, though progress is good. We arrived in Cancun airport around 3pm, and we were taken to our resort by a lomas travel van. We were greeted by the reception staff in thier beautiful lobby and were told our room was all ready. We were assigned a room in building 21, which i knew was by the beach area. The bell boy took us in a golf cart as this is a big resort. we got to our building, and our keys would not work. the bellboy checked with the housekeeping staff and they told him someone was already in our room?? After some checking around on the bellboys part they took us to a different room (they got us in with the house keeping key) , then he went and got the correct keys for our room. My husband commented that if this was our only problem then great! We had a beautiful ocean view! Later that night we came back to our room about 9pm, as we were very tired from a day of travel and as we got closer to our building we could hear load music, it ended up being the hotel next door was had a disco set up. We called down to the front desk and basically was told three different answers as too what was going on ( and we soon realized lies!) They would not change out room till the morning at 9 am. So in the morning while getting our new room (which ended not being ready until 1pm) , we were told that they have complaints all the time from people in that building but do nothing unless people complain!!! We were moved to building 26 and loved it. it is right in the middle, and so not too far from everything. Plus the monkeys hang out right in front of your room each evening! The resort is large, but also there are alot of people staying there. In the restraunts they seem to dispurse people so it is not so crowded by the specialty restraunts, so eatting is not too crowded. We really always could find someting we liked, and ended up liking the buffet the best. Sometimes we noticed that the service was hit or miss. one night depending on the staff it would be great and the next day you could hardly get your coffee refilled. We found the same at the pool bar service. It seemed to me that the pool waiters were more concerned about collecting empty cups that they would take your drink before you were even done, and if you ordered another, it would take as long as half an hour to get your new drink. Another thing we had never encountered before in mexico (we have done both all inclusives and non-inclusives before) was the fact that they really water down thier drinks or hide that fact that they do not put booze in them at all. A few times i was asked if i wanted alcohol in my drink !! The bartenders are pretty creative about how they hide it and count on that you do not really watch. I think due to the fact that this is a higher end resort with a higher end price, this was unacceptable. Other ways they cut corners are the cheap bathroom towels, and really bad beach towels. The lounges at both the pool and the beach are the worst i have seen. Beware you have to get up by no later then 7 am to get a pool lounge! it is awful. they were adding more shade coveres as we were there but people reserve both all the shade on the beach and around the pool. you can get umbrella's at the towel hut for the beach. Also we were woken up repeatly by the star friends staff as were were napping by the pool, this was dumb. I go on vacation to relax, if others want to do the activities then great. The hotel itself is beautiful , i had read all the reviews before going and was not diappointed in the grounds at all. for the most part all the staff are great.

Myself, Wife and child 4years old have been to cancun 12 times in the past 7 years. Iberostar Quetzal Mosquitos at dusk through the night were voracious, silent and imposible to detect in the darkness. Remember you are staying at a jungle type resort with wild animals and the hotel doesn't seem to attend to keeping the mosquito population down and out. They relaly need to daily! Around the building, the vegetation is their natural habit and the natives have very thick skin! Its not a problem for them but for visitors and small children its downright dangerous. Our first night and a trip to the resturant resulted in 11 bites on the legs of our 4 years old which caused him severe agony for 4 days. Everything is outdoors so spray well and bring mosquito killer spray for your room. When cleaning the room tell the cleaning lady to spray killer in the room before she leaves and returning to your room at night watch out by the door before entering as they linger and come in with you for feasting at night. Also roll up a towel and place it along the bottom of the door as apparently they walk under the door looking for victims. Also, the nightly entertainment (show) was in the only well airconditioned confererance hall but again the mostquitos were everyone biting on any flesh exposed and not covered in repellent. Daytime there is no problem with mosquitos. Food - was the best we have every had with quality and choices. Agains we have have stayed in many cancun hotels over the 7 years so we can only assume they have improved the food considerably. Kids club, better for 7 years and up. Unless you have a younger and compliant child below the age of 7 forget it! Well worth the trip and staff were super friendly and attentive again the best we have experienced.

We had an absolutely awesome time. To avoid repetitiveness, I won't write what everyone else has written about the hard beds, towel animals, weak drinks, warm pool, monkeys, peacocks, topless women, et cetera. There are many other reviews that describe those things in almost the same words. I'll just sum it up to say that we had the best of times there! We never encountered a staff member who wasn't willing to help us. What i would like to mention is that our vacation was a little over a month after Hurricane Emily, and it was obvious how hard everyone was working to repair the resort. The hurricane did not have any sort of negative effect on our vacation. Furthermore, the renovation efforts (which supposedly will contunue into October) never hindered or negatively affected our vacation. The work taking place in the jungle and in the theatre only occured from about 9:00am or so until 6:00 or so. One morning I walked northward on the beach and realized how lucky we were to even be there. Some resorts had sustained greater damage and were still closed. A few other quick notes: Please do tip the waiters and waitresses. They do appreciate it and some will remember you if you do. And they do think US $2 bills are lucky. We never had a problem finding chairs at the pool or the beach. If you do any day excursions, book them through the Funjet Desk (or Apple Vacations if you stay on the Tucan side). We found they had equal prices to the street vendors but without the hassle. We went on the Couples' Sunset Dinner Cruise and the Tulum Express, both of which were wonderful. There are many other ones to choose from for a wide range of prices. There is a Tequileria in the Tucan side of the resort. Do not buy tequila here as you can get it for half the price in Playa Del Carmen. That is really the case for most of the souvenirs. To sum it all up, this was one of the best vacations we've ever been on. We are already trying to figure out when we will go back next year--maybe to celebrate our first anniversary.", "Date": "September 3, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sayreville, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cAmazing time at the Quetzal!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3815415", "Content": "My parents and I stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal, although we had reservations for the Tucan. However, they are both equally beautiful and directly next to each other. We arrived on Tuesday, August 23rd and stayed until Saturday, August 27th. I celebrated my birthday at the resort, which was definately a nice way to top off my birthday. My parents stayed at the Iberostar Parasio Del Mar in May and they loved it. They enjoyed their stay so much that they came back with me, except to the Quetzal. Overall, the Iberostar chain has beautiful resorts, all with their own personality. However, the Quetzal is much smaller than the Parasio Del Mar which made it more convenient and comfortable for walking. Everything is conveniently placed on the Quetzal. The pool is right next to the beach, which is a major plus. The ocean was perfect. There were no waves, only slight ripples. The water was crystal clear without a hint of seaweed or rocks. Althougth these conditions are not the best for snorkeling, there still were a few fish swimming around. The temperature of the ocean had to have been at least 85 degrees, which is awesome in my book. The pool temperature was probably at least 90 or 95 degrees but I loved it. The rooms are not a far walking distance from the pool and beach area. And all of the restaurants are within walking distance, as well. You do not need any motor vehicle transporation to get from point A to point B, unlike the Parasio Del Mar. The food was great, especially within the restaurants. We ate at the Japenese and the Italian restaurants, both were equally delicious. The buffet food was also good. I do not have any complaints in that department. All of the waitors and waitresses are very nice which makes the atmopshere more enjoyable. The weather was perfect and we were very fortunate. And yes it was very hot there but what else do you expect when you are in the tropics. I did not mind the heat at all since both the ocean and the pool served as escapes. It rained one day during our stay but it only rained for a short period time but it did not affect our day or evening plans whatsoever. I do suggest to future travelers to bring an umbrella, whether you are staying at this resort or any resort within the area since rain is a common occurence in Mexico due to the hot and humid conditions. The resort is in the midst of the jungle, which gives it such a wonderful touch. There were a lot of species of animals within the resort, including monkies, parrots, swans, iguanas, turtles, ducks, flamingos, and a lot of other bird species. The \"howling monkies\" are definately my favorite, due to their distinct sounds. The name is not given to them for nothing. I believe it is the dominant male who makes a very loud howling noise. It sounds like a lion's roar and I laughed everytime I heard it. Speaking of monkies, we had an awesome experience with them. We were fortunate to have a balcony that overlooked the jungle, which gave us a lot of privacy. One morning, we woke up to see about six or seven monkies eating and relaxing within the trees right in front of us. It was amazing! There were no mosquitos, although other reviews stated otherwise. I am surprised that I did not encounter any since all of the beautiful waterfalls and water beds are breeding grounds for mosquitos but I am not complaining whatsoever. There was one area in particular that caught my eye. There was a fairly deep trench that consisted of a pond and two running waterfalls. It was beautiful and it was directly below the buffet area. Thus, as you walk to and from it, you can look down and observe all of the wildlife. Here are some suggestions for future travellers. Bring a blow up raft for both the pool and the beach. You can buy them at the hotel gift shop but you'll spend about $18.00 for one. I bought one for a $1.00 before I left. Also, the chairs and the cabanas by the pool and the beach are quick to go. So I suggest getting to the pool/beach area early enough to get a good spot of your choice. Although there are still plenty of chairs for everyone, the cabanas are quick to go. This was my first time in Mexico and I could not have asked for a more enjoyable experience. The grounds were beautiful and nicely kept. I definately recommend this resort to anyone.

They were still working on the Theater, does not look like it will be open until mid September at the pace they are working, but I'm sure it will be better than ever!! The shows in the Convention center were just fine, the a/c made it nice. We had not one rude person I could think of in the way of staff, even in the heat everyone was ready to please!!The only rude people were, the (I will not mention names) people who felt it necessary to cut me off at the buffet with my 2 year old son!! But if they are that hungry it's best to stay out of their way!!! The room was on third floor in Building 2100 block, nice view, only way to get full oceanview is to book a junior suite, in my opinion, not worth the price, we were hardly in our room and junior suite just means larger room, nothing extra fancy. We were travelling with our 2 year old , and may I give due credit to anyone else with children this young, we called it our \"Workation\", but we will definately remember the family vacation and glad we did it, just want to wait a few more years before we bring him back. I would suggest bringing floaties, or even a swim vest, our son was doing a good job with learning to swim with the vest and entertube. The childrens pool/ area was great for kid's club, ages 4 and up , although if your child was mature enough and toilet trained I am sure they would make an exception. The only swim up bar was in the adults pool, nice little retreat away from the hectic main pools, otherwise plenty of bars/beach bars to go to. The restaurants we ate in were; Mexican, Italian and Japanese, all were great, nice variety on menus, great tasting as well. We had room service a few times, limited menu but nice if say your 2 year old does not want to sit still for dinner!! And it is included. Also we usually had breakfast and lunch by the pool, 2 restaurants and poolside grill to order, that way no need to get out of our suits and walk up to lobby. Premium liquor is available upon request, the wine was pretty good, although I'm no wine snob so some may beg to differ. The beach was great, no seaweed or jellyfish to be found, although was quite rough for Playacar, only had the green flag one day! That was ok, we loved riding the waves. I can say there were not so many palapas, however ask to rent an umbrella at the towel stand, that way you will have shade. As usual there were pool and beach chair hogs, but that is everywhere!! They claimed to be overbooked during our stay, although you would never know it!! Bring lots of $1's and $5's for small purchases and tipping (if want to tip) We did not do Xcaret, although Natasha our funjet rep recommended it for smaller children, activities throughout the day wished we would have. We rented a jeep on Cozumel and that was fun and interesting, half the Island was closed to visitors due to hurrincane Emily, however the main drag by the Cruise ships/shopping and restaurants was open, and of course Chankaab was nice for snorkeling, I am not a diver but saw some pictures taken there. We rented from Hertz, because it was our first time, but next time I would not hesitate to rent from one of the cheapy places, half the price!! We also did the San Gervosio ruins, open when we were there, but wow the devistation from Emily was awful especially to the Occidental and Iberostar Cozumel resorts. Think twice about some of the pricey trips, alot you can do on your own, but if you are new to the area, you might want to go escorted. All in all it was another fabulous trip to Mexico, for those that complain about the resort just being \"Ok\", they have to bring together many different nations and apeal to everyone's tastes and ideas of fun might not be the same, but I think you have to agree, you get what you pay for, and Iberostar is worth every penny, now if you were dissapointed with something like the Ritz Carlton or other very pricey chain then that would be expected, no where in the discription does the Iberostar claim to be \"Fine dining, or most exquiste in world\" if you are not open to new things than just stay home, more room for the rest of us easy going people!!", "Date": "August 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "west allis, wisconsin", "Title": "\u201ciberostar quetzal\u201d", "Author": "mattmolly", "ReviewID": "UR3741462", "Content": "I just returned from 7 days at the iberostar quetzal.

I read every review prior to our trip to Iberostar and all the information was right on! We had an absolutely wonderful time. We split a week with 4 nights at the Iberostar and 3 nights at the Hilton in Cancun. Our major complaint was our transfers that were arranged by Lomas travel were canceled without our knowledge and the Lomas agents were extremely rude and refused to refund or re book transfers! I do not recommend using them at all! Our vacation was booked through UsAir Vacations and I am still waiting for a response on that matter. I booked our day trip to Xcaret park and swim with the dolphins several months before our trip directly at their web site and saved several hundred dollars. Xcaret is wonderful. I recommend bringing your own floats from home. They are great for the pool and ocean. They have someone at the water sports hut to blow them up for you. We paid 15.00 US dollars per float( a $2 float!). Make your reservations for dinner as soon as you arrive because they are very difficult to get. If you go to the buffet, the one near the front (at the wood walkway) is the best for breakfast and dinner. The buffet was really good with so many things to choose from. The beds and pillows are hard as lots of reviews have stated. The service is wonderful and they are constantly cleaning and maintaining the property. We never had a problem getting a chair (actually 5 together). We loved the pools and only my husband complained of the water being to warm as others have stated. My kids and I liked the water that temp. The beaches and water are beautiful. As we walked down the beach we noticed the beaches were not near as nice further down some with no beach at all. We walked up to the shops at Playa. Not much there but I got a beautiful hammock for 40.00. Never got a chance to go into Play del Carmen. While we have been on many cruises this is only our 3rd all inclusive and we were all very satisfied with our vacation.

The only complaint we had was that early in the day tourists reserved chairs by the pool and they often are not there for long periods of time. That leaves the rest of us looking for a place to sit. But even when the pool chairs were filled, you could usually get chairs on the beach and it is a beautiful beach. Lots of clean sand, lots of ocean, no rocks, and there is a small bar right at the beach. Everything was great. The Mexican people in the resort and in Playa del Carmen were friendly and helpful. They treated you like family and more. The food at the resort was good tasting and there was enough variety for everyone. My daughter is a vegetarian and she found plenty to eat. The specialty restaurants were very good, particularly the steak restaurant and the Italian restaurant. At the steak restaurant the steak was tender and excellent tasting. The alcoholic beverages were mixed perfectly. They were not too strong, but certainly not watered down either. The bracelets they give you at the beginning of your stay help them to know who is of age and who is underage for drinking. In Mexico the drinking age is 18 so parents be aware. There is a dance club right within the resort for those who love to dance. The security is excellent, both in the resort and in town. We saw no problems and even when a young guest had a bit too much to drink the staff was courteous and helpful to get him back to the room safely. One thing we enjoyed about this resort was the \"jungle\" environment. The Quetzal shares the same pool and central area with the Tucan resort. The center area between the two resorts is a large jungle like area with walking paths. There are many animals walking around and monkeys in the trees. Lot's of birds. There were even iguanas and tucans. It just made the resort that much more special. I would not hesitate to recommend this resort to someone looking for a good place to stay at a reasonable price.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cPura Vida!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "raider20", "ReviewID": "UR3573173", "Content": "I have to admit I read almost every review on the Quetzal/Tucan before we went on vacation. It seemed like I knew everything to expect before we got to Playa. I know there are a lot of you out there that do the same thing. You\u2019ve booked your trip 4 months in advance and then you read every single review that comes through:) Like I said, I did the same thing so don\u2019t feel bad. We booked our trip through FunJet (June1-6). Everything went absolutely great. If you\u2019re booking through FunJet make sure you pay the extra money for a direct transfer to and from the airport. I\u2019m so glad we did this. I\u2019ve read and heard horror stories about people sitting on a bus with 40 other people. If you are on the bus you have to stop at every resort in Playacar and wait for people to get off. Long story short, it\u2019s well worth your extra $30 or so to get a direct transfer. My only complaint with Funjet is the travel agents that work at the resort. I really think they get some sort of commission on the excursions they provide. My brother in-law and I walked around to the Tucan side and checked out the prices that Apple Vacations were offering. We literally had one of the FunJet reps follow us over there and tell us that we shouldn\u2019t be booking with another agency (which you can). Do your research and find the better price between all the agencies at the resort or in town. Whatever you do, do not feel like you have to book with the FunJet rep at the resort. The resort itself was absolutely amazing. You can\u2019t even imagine what it looks like until you\u2019re actually there. I have never seen a more beautiful place in my life. I had a hard time choosing between the Gala and the Iberostar Quetzal when booking our trip. Our group walked over to the Gala (next door) one afternoon to check everything out. It was not half as nice as the Quetzal/Tucan. I\u2019m sure the Gala is a great place to stay, but if you\u2019re comparing the layout of the resorts and the atmosphere\u2026the Quetzal is a no brainer. The jungle atmosphere at the resort is what makes the Quetzal so amazing. Monkeys, parrots, swans, etc. are everywhere you go. I could go on trying to explain it, but you can\u2019t imagine it until you actually go. I would have to say the best thing about the resort is the service you get. I\u2019ve never been at a place where the people are so happy and are willing to do everything they can to make you happy. I\u2019ve heard these people make a couple of dollars a day\u2026...As for myself, it was a huge reality check. It\u2019s amazing how you can tip someone $2 in Mexico and they act so appreciative\u2026.whereas you tip someone $2 in the US and they look at you like you\u2019re cheap. One afternoon it rained for 20 minutes\u2026..after it rained there were probably 10 guys sweeping the leaves off the sidewalks in the jungle. It really did become a joke with our group. Everywhere you look there were people working there tails off. Not only were the people working so hard, but they were so happy at the same time. The service was by far what makes this resort the best!!!!!!!! Food The food was great\u2026.especially the breakfast buffet. There is such a variety of food at the buffets. We ate at 3 of the ala carte restaurants\u2026.Japanese and Steakhouse were awesome. I do have to say I\u2019m from Texas and I know what a great steak tastes like. It wasn\u2019t the best steak I ate but it came very close. The Tropical was ok. Nothing special. I would definitely make sure you go to the Japanese and Steakhouse. Activities and Beach Before the big hassle with the FunJet reps, we booked a snorkeling excursion through FunJet. It was horrible!!!!! The FunJet rep said it was going to be a 4 hr. roundtrip\u2026.it ended up being a 7 hr. roundtrip. We went to a place called Paroma???Paloma????\u2026some place in Playa that offers snorkeling, fishing, etc. Our FunJet rep told us all we needed was our bathing suites and $2 for some tax fee. We were to leave at 8 and be back at the resort at 12. We were done snorkeling at 11:30 and we stayed at this place until 2. They keep you around so you\u2019ll buy their food, drinks, shirts etc. My advice\u2026..do not book anything with the FunJet rep. We did go parasailing, which was really fun. I had never done it before\u2026it was well worth the $40 per person. A lot of the time we laid out at the beach and drank Miami Vices. I don\u2019t like sweet drinks, but these were really good. The beach itself was gorgeous\u2026.blue water, white sand, palm trees, all the alcohol you want to drink. It was great!!!!! It was a lot of fun meeting people from all over the world and getting to know their cultures. A lot of Europeans\u2026..which was great\u2026.everyone I met was extremely nice. There are tons of activities around the beach and the resort during the day so you\u2019ll never get bored. We did go to the pool bar everyday which was nice and relaxing. Nothing like sitting on a stool in the pool by a waterfall having a cold beer. There are not a lot of things that can beat that. :) My brother in-law and I went catamaraning a couple of days which was a lot of fun. It takes a little work but it\u2019s great to get out in the middle of the ocean on you own personal sail boat and hang out. It was definitely nice and relaxing. Bottom line, the beach is awesome. Rooms The rooms were very nice. A/C worked great, refrigerator was always full with what we asked our maid to fill it with, fun towel art everyday. I\u2019m sure everyone has heard about the hard beds. They are hard but it was never a problem going to sleep as we were always worn out. We always tipped the maid $2 everyday\u2026\u2026.she was extremely nice\u2026.never could understand her because she didn\u2019t speak English\u2026..but she sounded happy and appreciative:) 5th St. 5th st. was a lot of fun. Lots of shops where you can go in and bargain. My girlfriend bought a $105 ring for $45. How awesome is that? It\u2019s a lot of fun. You just have to learn to ignore the hagglers trying to make you come in their shop to buy something. YAXCHE is a restaurant we ate at one night, which is off 5th and 8th. It was by far the best meal we ate the entire trip. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone\u2026..about $10-$20 per plate. Not too expensive\u2026\u2026great food and service. If you go, make sure you ask for Louis\u2026.by far the best waiter I\u2019ve ever had. We also went to the Blue Parrot\u2026..lot\u2019s of fun and once again cold beer on the beach. Alux is another bar that we went to. It\u2019s a natural cave in which it has a restaurant/bar. Very beautiful and romantic. Watch out for the frozen drinks. My sister had one. I\u2019m not sure if they purify their water\u2026..a little case of Montezuma the next couple of days. Just be careful of what you eat and drink. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. I would definitely go back in a heartbeat. I can\u2019t stop talking about this place to friends and family. If you already have your trip booked, I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed.

Well the pool at this resort was like jumping into a jacuzzi in the heat of the day. The pool was not cold the entire time i stayed there. The adult pool did offer some relief from the heat because it was in the shade but it still was not as cold as i was expecting. The beach was absolutely gorgeous and it seemed that the beaches farther down had some erosion but the quetzal had a great beach. The food at the resort was not what i was expecting either. I had read reviews from tripadvisor before i left and many people said the food was very good. There were some things that were OK but nothing to brag about. I know that this is an all inclusive but i have stayed at all inclusives before with much better food than this place. The drinks at the resort were also just OK i expected more from a 4 1/2 star hotel. The did not even use fresh fruit in any of the drinks!

One of the monkeys makes a sound that sounds like a 400 lb. gorilla.we saw the Monkeys every single day. 10 of them. We went jet skiing parasailing swam with the dolphins and I went diving.everything was just perfect. Like others that wrote before I was very uncofortable sleeping in the beds but I am tall and like a soft bed these beds are alittle small for me and hard.everyone saves chairs so take turns getting up by 7:30 to get your favorite spot.To get a massage is $36 plus tip. parasailing was $40 a piece I did a single tank dive and I was allready certifide that only cost $58 with my own regulator.The dive was my fav. thing swimming with moray eels and sea turtes was great and even on a rough day the visibility was at least 100 feet. We made reservations to each restaurant but only went to 2 of them. we like to have our freedom and do't like to have to be somewhere at a certain time especially if we are having so much fun. besides the kids liked the buffet the best anyway.One thing I was dissapointed about was The disco at night it would have been better if they had somewhere else for the kids to go .they only have one disco and the adults and children share it . and i felt kind of strange invading on my kids while they were trying to meet new friends and dance.at the same time I did not feel comfortable leaving them in there to late with the adults drinking in there.but we worked around it.The hotel staff work so hard and they keep this place as clean as Disney even the jungle.Our room was always clean. I wish they had Coronas there . But there are plenty of other drinks. The shows were good especially when they do the audience participation. We went to wet and wild and swam with the dolphins it cost 125 a piece that included the transportation passes to wet and wild and swimming with dolphins we booked this at the funjet table inside the hotel lobby.

In our opinion the good definitely outweighed the bad. The beach is spectacular. Be prepared for the topless women though. It was a bit shocking for my kids (ages 8 and 9) on the first day, but then they just got used to it! The water is so beautiful it's almost unbelievable. We were able to snorkel right there and saw a giant school of fish- don't know what kind though. We watched the people parasailing and kayaking and riding the banana boats. Finding lounge chairs was never a problem. If we were out there by about 10 we could get the front row, after that you still had plenty to choose from on the other rows. As for the room itself, we were in building 22, third from the beach overlooking the small pool used for playing volleyball and basketball. The room was nice, not fancy in anyway. The beds were hard- you could jump on them and they would never move! The pillows were okay except that they tuck the pillowcases inside so it made it lumpy. The bathroom was small and the door opened into the toilet, so that was odd. The showere is nice and big. My biggest suggestion concerning the bathroom is if you are used to drying your hair, bring your own blowdryer. I have shoulder length hair, and it took me about 30 minutes to dry it using the one in the bathroom! It barely blows and is not very warm at all. Take advantage of the free use of the safe in the closet. You make up your own code and it is worth it to store money and passports. Onto the resort itself. Saw monkeys, flamingos, peacocks, iguanas, turtles and roosters. Great fun to walk through everytime. Beware- the monkeys will pee on you if you stand underneath them too long. I dodged it fortunately! The atmosphere is great and we all enjoyed the jungle. The food- we dined at the Carribean restaurant, the Mexican and the Japanese. By far the Japanese was the best. I'm not a seafood lover, so I did not enjoy the Carribean (the mashed potatoes were just wierd), but the rest of our group liked it. I used the advice of another reviewer and went to the buffet closest to the lobby and was happy I did so. What we lovingly nicknamed the \"snack shack\" closest to the pool just didn't have as good of a selection as the one near the lobby. The food was okay- they had some different things everyday, like they had a chicken cordon bleu that was yummy, and they had ham one night. There is always hamurgers and hotdogs and fries. We thought a lot of the food lacked some flavor, but we ate plenty! The staff were all very nice. Everyone one you pass says Hola! The Star Friends were okay- my kids enjoyed it more than the adults. We went into town a few times. It takes about 30 minutes to walk or you can take a taxi for about $4. Lots of fun in town. We did an excursion to Xel-Ha to snorkel. The water was very cold! Some of us had our own snorkel gear and just used the free life jackets. Others rented their gear and I think it was around $7 to rent the fins and masks and they give you a snorkel for free that you keep, you also had to put down a refundable deposit of $20. That was nice. Saw a lot of fish, but unfortunately for us it started raining so we were only in the water for about an hour and half. This was our first time to snorkel and we loved it!

We just returned from 7 day stay with our 6 year old granddaughter and we were very very pleased all around. 1st, a little travel history; I have extensively traveled the caribbean, especially Mexico for the last nine years. This is the 1st resort that I would give a score any higher than a 3* (thinking in American Standards) and this resort gets 5*'s. The resort is very clean and well maintained, all of the maintenance staff were wonderful. We experienced a little A/C trouble on our 1st night and they came right away to fix it. For our trouble they delivered a giant basket of beautifully arranged fresh fruit. Our room was 2030 (beachfront on the Quetzal side) and the room steward was Dariella. Darilella was very meticulous and always made animal shapes in our towels, used fresh flowers and was very creative in her endeavors. Our mini bar was always stocked and gallons of bottled water provided. We even had fresh flower arrangements in our room. I have read questionable reiews of the buffet food service but we found it to be the best quality and variety we have ever encountered at any other all-inclusive resort. Abigail, the food service manager, was always in the dining rooms to assure the quality and flavor of her menus. She would walk around and talk with the patrons to make sure all were happy and well taken care of. The food could not have been much better. We tried 3 of the \"reservations only\" restaurants and the best were the steak house and the tropical. All in all though we preferred to dine in the buffet because we had many more choices and did not have to be there at any particular time. The staff that work with the children could not have been any better. They really give you the feeling that they love children and would not rather be anywhere else than with them. In fact, all of the staff, including the entertainers, seemed to really love and cater to the children. They have activities all day and most of the night and the staff were always there to help the children participate. The hotel grounds are beautiful with a jungle that has peacocks, monkeys, a large tortoise, ducks, and other animals that I cannot identify. The lobby and, large buffets, and the theater are surrounded by Koi ponds and fountains. The beach, even with the erosion problems further to the north is large and kept very clean. There are lots of palm trees for shade or open spaces to the sun. There is a beach bar, showers, and dive shop right on the beach. The 2 pool buffets are located right next to the beach and are open for breakfast and lunch. There are plenty of activities at the resort and for a change we seldom left the property except to shop one day, take a trip to Xcaret, and a trip to Akumal. We, as stir crazy travelers, were perfectly content to hang around the resort. You can be lazy or participate in any of the many activites; the schedule had something going on about every half hour. All in all this was a great resort and we feel that we got our moneys worth and more.

The buffet had a tremendous number of choices and even the pickiest eater in our family had no trouble. The room was nice but certainly not luxury accommodations.

We overlooked the jungle and actually saw the monkeys in the trees just beyond our patio. The Quetzal side was much more jungly than the Tucan side, I thought. Anyway, for $2 a day, Veronica gave us towel art, a spotless room, and extra bottled water. Again, the room was perfectly fine, just don't expect the Ritz. The grounds were beautiful. The pool was a bit cool in the morning but like bath water by the afternoon. The water was too rough to swim in the Gulf most days. We had no problem finding 4 lounge chairs together at 10am. We did a bunch of excursions. Xcaret was our favorite. The underground river was truly amazing (the water was absolutely freezing). No real snorkeling there, though. Xel-Ha had pretty good snorkeling, but that was about it. Yal Ku had the best snorkeling and was the least crowded. We also went to Tulum for about an hour. Everyone said to hire an English speaking guide when you get there, but we found it to be a total rip-off. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling on a family vacation.

My only complaint about the rooms is that there is construction going on at the hotel next door and I really didn't want to hear that kind of noise on my vacation.

The Japanese is a Benihana style restaurant, which was fun and delicious. The Mexican was okay-it was nice to be served dinner instead of going to the buffet, but the kids decided they'd prefer the buffet over the menu choices. Food was so-so. The Steak House restaurant was very good. The buffet was always excellent for breakfast and dinner. The poolside restaurant is great for a very casual lunch (wear your swimsuit). The \"Star Friends\" are the on-site group of performers who put on a different show every night. They even have a children's performance every night, and our little friends we were vacationing with (aged 4, 6 & 7) were in a couple of the performances. The Star Friends come around the pool and beach during the day and encourage the children to come rehearse for an hour and then are in a cute show that night. After this portion of the show, there is an audience participation segment and then a different themed show performed by the Star Friends. It gets long but is fun. My husband & I went to Tuluum for an excursion. (No one else in our party was interested). It was about a 40 minute ride each way, and well worth it to see Mayan ruins. We booked this trip in the hotel lobby, and had to walk about 5 minutes up the street to Playacar to catch our Tour bus. It was very organized and worth the trip.

Our family went on a snorkelling excursion, also booked through the hotel lobby. We went to two places for 45 minutes each to snorkel - a shallow spot where we barely saw any fish, and to deep water, where we felt like we were in \"Finding Nemo\".

There was cycling which we did into the town, and it was quite safe to walk around outside which was unusual in most of the places we have stayed before. There was a spa where you could have a sauna, and massage which was great, this could be done on the beach as well. The staff were all very friendly and you couldn't fault the service. We went on trips to which were well co-ordinated and organised. The hotel itself was a nice place to walk and look around due to all the animals and the decor.

We read several of the reviews before arriving, and as the majority of the reviews state, we where very impressed with the hotel and the amenities. When you arrive and find your bus you will find the ride to the hotel entertaining. The tip on bringing plenty of \"ones\" ($$) was helpful. They will offer you Corona once you leave the airport. When we arrived at the hotel on Sunday around noon, the first thing that we loved was the open air lobby and how beautifully decorated and welcoming it was. We stayed in building 22 which was right next to the pools and beach. This was very nice because we could see \"parts\" of the ocean from our balcony, but could hear it clearly every morning and evening when we sat out to enjoy coffee or a beer. The rooms were very clean, and as mentioned, the AC worked very well. The beds are a little firm, however my wife and I found no problem getting a good night's rest. We did take our own pillows. We left $2 each day for the maid. One suggestion for coffee drinkers is to bring along a larger mug. One morning we walked the beach around 7:00 AM and it would have been nice to fill our mug at the pool side restaurant before we went walking. If you need extra coffee, just leave your maid a note, and they will fulfill your request. This includes extra water, cokes, and beer as well. We made our coffee and brushed our teeth with the bottled water each time and never had any stomach problems. The beach was wonderful! The water is warm and a beautiful aqua color. Lounges are more readily available there than at the pool. We spent 90% of our time at the beach, and found it to be cooler because of the breeze. The wait staff were very diligent in asking you what you needed and removing empty glasses. I will say that we found that a lot of people would just leave half to full drinks wherever they wanted. One day there were actually two drinks that someone had left on the steps that go into the pool. We thought this was very inconsiderate and lazy. However the staff runs around like crazy picking up after people. We wondered what they thought about how we lived at home! We ate dinner at the Japanese restaurant the 1st night. It was our favorite as far as food and entertainment. Highly recommend. The main buffet for breakfast and dinner was excellent. We recommend that you \"shop\", because there are a multitude of choices. The staff was very attentive and helpful! Wherever we were on the grounds they were always very friendly! The big disappointment for us was the Steak restaurant. We had read many reviews saying how excellent it was so our expectations were high. I guess it comes down to what you are used to. Being from Texas, we ranked it right there along with the Golden Corral at best. It was not from a lack of trying, just very disappointing from reading previous reviews. We did do the tandem Parasailing and it was a lot of fun!! It lasts about 10-12 minutes which seemed short, but we would do it again! We also did the Paradise Reef Snorkeling. The day we went was very windy, so the water was rough. They take you to two different sites. The first site was okay, but the 2nd was excellent despite the choppy water. We left at 12:45 PM and returned to the hotel at 6:30 PM. The pool is great for families with kids. As mentioned, we preferred the beach. The swim up bar pool area was disappointing because it was small, off by itself, and always seemed crowded. How long can people sit/stand there and drink without ever leaving the pool? :( We loved the hotel grounds. Very well kept, and the wildlife was cool. We did wish that the hotel had signs directing you to the lobbies, restuarants, pool area etc. Walking on the path through the \"jungle\" area was a lot of fun, especially at night because of the lighting. Watch out for those low trees after too many drinks. :) The entertainment at night was worth attending, but we wished that there had been a place for adults to go to afterwards for dancing. The Disco was dead, and attracted teens only when we stopped by once. We did go into PDC for shopping. Worth the trip. Take water from the room. We recommend doing this in the morning because it does get hot in the afternoon. It is $4 for the cab each way. We had an excellent time and would recommend this property, especially for families. Topless sun bathing is allowed on the beach. What should be banned are Speedo's :) We had fun!!!!

We chose this resort based on reviews at tripadvisor. We had previously visited Club Med several times and were interested to see how they compare. Some observations about the resort: 1) The look of grounds at this resort were great - the kids loved the \"jungle\" and the animals. There were monkeys playing in the trees right across from our room! There are flamingos and peacocks too. 2) The size of the grounds were not as large as the typical sprawling Club Med resort - other hotels were right next to ours (Club Med resorts ususally seem a bit more isolated from other hotels) 3) The buffet food was very good - the selection for the buffet was a little limited (less variety than the Club Med Buffet) 4) The specialty restaurants were also very good and we did not have any problem getting reservations at the time that we wanted (max 2 visits during a 1 week stay though) 5) The beach was very nice but the guests played the usual \"reserve chairs for the whole day even when they're not using it\" game so after the first day of a poor selection of chairs we played along 6) The kids club was a definite step down from Club Med - there were fewer children in the club and the activities were not as good as Club Med but the kids had a good time anyway - Club Med kids clubs have many different age bands so the activities can be quite targeted (all ages were together at the Quetzal and it didn't open until about 10:30 compared to 9:00 at Club Med.) 7) Some people in other reviews claimed that the drinks were watered down but we did not find that to be true - the bartenders would use whatever brand of alcohol that you wanted and would allow you to \"make it a double\" Observations on other parts of our trip: I STRONGLY recommend that you do not arrive in the Cancun airport on a Saturday at the start of a spring break. It took about 3 hours and 15 minutes from the time we got off the plane until the time we got to the resort (2 hours in immigration line alone!). We wanted to go to Chichen Itza by plane but several people in the resort warned us that there were some crashes in previous years so most people do not use planes any more. We booked a tour with Cancun Lines instead. Chichen Itza was interesting but extremely hot (98) and humid when we went. Our guide and the restaurant we used for lunch were great but I must say that the bus was extremely disappointing. It was BARELY air conditioned and the we arrived back at the hotel later than the (sales) representative promised. We spent about 1.5 hours picking up passengers at other resorts before we started going towards Chichen Itza and 1 hour dropping them off upon return. I recommend that you find another way to get to Chichen Itza if you go. You can rent a car for about $50.00. We were given a quote of about $300.00 for two people for our own guide and a car. In summary, Iberosat Quetzal is a very nice resort. We do like Club Med a little bit better. However, we've gone to the only resorts that have kids clubs within reasonable travel time (<14 hours door-to-door) twice each (Punta Cana and Ixtapa). Since we do not want to keep going to the same places over and over we will probably go to another Iberostar resort again for next year's spring break.

The meat had a salty taste to it, especially the steakhouse which we would not recommend as others that also dined there were disappointed. We ended up eating pizza and fries most of the time. The website we found this resort on said that they serve domestic and international beer, wine, and cocktails, which is false. The only beer they had was Dos Eques XXX which we were sick of after the second day. We had to go to downtown just to get a Corona or Heineken. Downtown was actually nicer than expected though and only a 5 dollar ride from the resort. You can finds tons of really nice restaurants and bars there. We ended up going into town almost every night because there isn't much nightlife on the resort. The resort has just two bars/lounges that close at 12 and a disco that was open till 3. Also if your not an animal lover we would not recommend this resort as there are all kinds of wild animals(nothing dangerous) wandering around and making weird noises in the morning and at night.

A faultless holiday without a single complaint- truly amazing!! Just returned from our vacation to the IB Quetzel. We travelled with a family group of 13 of all ages. If you have recently booked this hotel, you truly will not be disapointed. The pool was fabulous, but preferred the beach, all that sea n sand Hmmm! The pool tends to get really crowded and a big problem getting a lounger so we opted for the beach, also cooler but not too breezy. If you want the sun all day at the pool, I would suggest to pick a spot near the sports pool which is on the Quetzel side. Sun all day.Scuba dive centre is on the beach divide of the Quetzal and Riu Yucatan and costs around $400 to take a full course and qualify in PADI. All water sports were fantastic. Jet ski $55 for half hour, banana boat rides $8 per person for 20 mins. We stayed in building 25, which was ideal and central to all areas, especially the main buffet area. The food was plentiful and the service was impecable,thanks to Rafael our waiter, who took care of our every request. Nothing was ever any trouble. No runny tummies and we all ate salad every day. we did however stick to bottled water even to brush our teeth.No queing at the restaurants and booking al a carte was no trouble.The hotel was absolutely spotless with staff constantly cleaning.Beds were fine, air con was good, rooms were spotless. Tipped one dollar per day to housekeeping as a kind gesture. One warning, keep all valuables locked in the safes, a few items did go missing such as jewelry and soft toys and some cash, so be warned. We did report this the hotel mangement but, as always, it is hard to prove any form of theft.Plenty to do during the day thanks to the star friends. For all you ladies running out of time for any spa/ beauty treatments before you leave, the spa on the tucan side was excellent. I highly recommend the exfoiliating seaweed wrap and anti stress full body massage( a birthday treat for my daughter and I on arrival!) at the beginning of your hoilday to prep your skin and relax your mind after a long flight! All aspects of beauty treatment available at reasonable prices.The gymnasium had good facilities and is open from 7am for you folks wanting to start the day with a work out. Tennis tuition is free and is available for all levels. intermediate from 7am beginners at 10am. courts can be prebooked for games at reception, however make sure you book early to get a cool morning slot as the temps rise rapidly by 11am too hot to enjoy a game. Soccer/football is also an option and teams -5 a side- play at 5pm ,so boys don't forget your trainers/sneekers! If you get a chance, meet up with one of the star friends at either 10am or 3pm at the bike shed outside the Tucan and take a bike ride in PDC town and get a free guided tour of the town and the local area. It,s good to see the sights and get your bearings early on in your stay. The disco mascara is ok with all ages. They will serve drinks to the young teenagers with white bands, so if you are taking teens, be warned. We only let ours stay under the watchful eye of our pretty sensible 18 yr olds or ourselves. Safe to walk back to rooms but would recommend to stay in a group.Some pretty drunken people walking around late at night / early in the morning. Nightlife in PDC gets going around 11.30 pm and mambo cafe is a brilliant place to meet with locals and enjoy free salsa classes. Be warned there are some pretty good profesional dancers who may make you look pretty lame in the dancing dept! Don't panic if you are approached with a builders hard hat on arrival, it's only a fun way to take your teqilla slammer as they slam it down not on the bar, but on your hat! Drinks are pretty expensive $20 for three drinks! Taxis are safe and reliable, you can ask for one to be sent to meet you via reception, and cost around $4 -$5 into town. So enjoy!

My, husband and two children ( 6&9) and I arrived at the resort on a Sunday around noon and a room was ready for us.The rooms were fine. They were clean and we had plenty of room. The bathrooms were fine as well. Our housekeeper did an excellent job. We did tip her every day. We were on the Quetzal side in building 25. We enjoyed this location. The food was fine. I was VERY worried about getting sick. Nobody in my family did. I was very picky about what I ate (not salads or anything with mayo) My husband ate EVERYTHING and never got sick. My kids are picky eaters to begin with and usually found something. They sure did eat a lot of french fries and icecream this trip. I did take snacks for the kids and was glad I did. Comfort food from home was good for them once in a while. They both loved the soft icecream!!! We were able to make 3 dinner reservations: The Japanese restaurant, the Italian restaurant and the Mexican resaurant. All were very good. The dinner buffet was good (never ate here for lunch) The breakfast buffet was great. We ate lunch every day at one of the restaurants by the pool, which were good too. We did eat breakfast by the pool one day and it was fine. It did not have a huge selection like the main buffet. There were a ton of activities going on. My kids, especially my 6 year old daughter loved the kids club. She only went in when she wanted to and she loved it. The 2 girls and one guy who worked there were very nice and I felt comfortable leaving her. My son ( 9 years old) went a few times as well when some of the friends he met went. He loved playing ping pong by the pool. Take rafts or floats for the pool. We were lucky enough to have someone give us two when they left and we kept them for the trip then gave them away. The water in the pool and at the beach were very warm. The beach was nice. A few days there were waves (which my kids loved) and a few days it was pretty calm. One or two days there was a lot of seaweed. There were a few topless woman but my son didn't really notice. My daughter did and had some pretty funny comments! We did have to get up early (7:00 am ) to reserve chairs by the pool. The entertainment at night was fun. Every night around 8:15 there was a \"kid's disco\" with fun things for the kids to do. After the disco there was usually music and dancing for about a half hour than adult \"audience participation\" activites which were very enjoyable to watch. Then there was a show following. We stayed one night for the show. It was ok. It ended too late for us to do it everynight with our kids. We left the resort twice. We went to Playacar once for a little shopping. This is a 10 minute walk. Very safe. It had the typical things you would expect to find in Mexico. My daughter got half of her head braided for $25.00. At the resort it was $45 for half the head and $75 for the entire head. We also went to Xcaret for a day. We booked this on the internet before we left. IF I had to do it over again I would not do it. There was too much going on at our resort to ever have to leave. Xcaret was an expensive day for us because we did swim with the dolphins. It was a neat experince and I am glad we got a chance to do it but once is enough for us. We took a cab to Xcaret which cost $10 and took no more than 15 minutes. We met alot of nice people on this trip from all over the world. The staff was very hard working a nd friendly. The grounds of this resort were very pretty. The food and water were fine.

We had done a lot of research and followed word of mouth to end up here, and we were not disappointed. Pool and beach are great, and close to each other so you can hop back and forth. Took out catamarans twice, recommend the $2 insurance in case you break something...short money. Played beach volleyball every day at 10 and 3... a blast and Carolina (Starfriends VB coordinator) is not only great to look at, but a sweetheart too. Food at the buffet had decent variety and the waitstaff was very attentive. Ate at the Japanese (great) and the Caribbean restaurants (just OK). They rushed us out of the latter a bit because they were trying to turn it around for the next group. I withdrew $75 of US dollars before leaving, and I could have stood to bring more. Tipping is very much appreciated and it gets you better service at the bar and restaurants. Plus these kids all deserve it. Stayed in bldg 25, which was midpoint. From what I could tell, there really doesn't seem to be a bad building to be in. 21 is closest to the beach and 28 is near the lobby, but it is all easily walkable and the scenery is so nice, you don't mind. I am still puzzled by all of the fanfare around the \"uncomfortable beds and pillows\". They seemed fine (and my wife is sensitive to that kind of stuff), plus you were so exhausted at the end of the night, I could have slept on a bed of nails. Rooms were nice in terms of both space and level of luxury. Went to Xcaret for a day, which was a nice diversion. Recommend the restaurant out by the water (Peninsula) where you literally eat right on the water! The show at night was OK, but the kids were bored by the end. Dolphin swim is outrageous at $112/person. Were going to do it, but bailed when we saw the price. After seeing people do it, I thanked God we did. It wasn't all that special (you can watch others do it) and the kids seemed indifferent. The snorkeling in the cove wasn't that great as there is a layer of oil slick (suntan oil I think) in the first 2 feet of water so visibility is poor. The water was rough that day, but typically they let you out of the cove which I assume is a better experience. Spent a morning in Playa, nothing real special as it is you typical shopping experience. Lots of people trying to sell you day trips and golf excursions etc. which is quite annoying. Any place you go in be prepared to barter, especially if prices are not marked. We met lots of great people from all over (lots of Texans) which made it real nice. The kids met several sets of buddies which made our life much easier. The kid camp was good and my 5 year old seemed to enjoy it as long as there was someone she could talk to her own age there. I would say 5/6 is the limit for kid camp as it seemed that was the limit of the ages there for the kids. You can drop them off for anywhere from 30 minutes to 8 hours, no hassle. They will take them to lunch and everything. We would often drop off around 4 so we could hang next door in the Auqabar for a few. I thought there was supposed to be a seperate thing for the 6-10'ish set, but saw no sign of it. Our 8 year old was plenty occupied though with the pool and his buddies he met. All in all, a great vacation. We will either return there next year, or perhaps try Iberostart in the DR as an alternative. I can't say enough good about it.

I speak Spanish reasonably well, I travel worldwide extensively, and I enjoy vacationing on the Yucatan. So I went to the Iberostar Quetzal. We arrived via a Funjet vacation charter flight on the most cramped flight I have ever rode. But that's what I expected to experience. We arrive in Cancun International Airport only to find it in much better shape than I remember. Extensive renovations are ongoing (2003-2006) making the airport much better (and more air conditioned) into a true world-class airport. It's also important to note that when flying into this airport in the busy season, you may be walking down stairs onto the runway from your plane as they only have a few jet ways. But what an experience. A short, pre-arranged funjet bus ride to the Iberostar was made much more enjoyable by a cool cerveza (that's beer). We finally pull up to the resort just after nightfall. Its thatched, open-air lobby glows with beautiful yellow light in the evenings. It's truly unforgettable. We checked in and were issued wristbands. One color for those 18 and over and another for those under 18. Now, do not get me wrong on the following statement. My son is three weeks from being 18, the legal drinking age in Mexico. If you have ever been to Mexico, you know that the drinking age is not enforced. Believe me; it certainly is enforced in this resort. The wait staff refused to serve my son wine with dinner, with my consent. It certainly bordered on the insane. More on underage drinking to come... Check in was not a problem. Our bags were transported by golf cart to our room. The resort is on a narrow, long piece of land. Beachfront, there are the most expensive rooms and suites. Behind these rooms, the regular rooms are lined up all the way to the lobby. Our room was located in the closest regular building to the beach. In other words, there was one building between us and the beach. The rooms are great. The air-conditioning functions excellently without excess condensation that many resorts suffer from. The bathroom is lavish, the shower is great. I think I want one of them built into my house. It was essentially a walk-in without a door. A body wash, shampoo, and conditioner is attached to the shower wall. They all smelled great. The beds we found to be fine, nothing great, and nothing terrible. The minibar was always stocked (with beer- certainly funny that they put beer in my son's room yet won't let him have wine with dinner). Maid service was great. Make a habit of leaving gifts for your maid. Your gift will come back to you tenfold. Our two rooms were in separate buildings and we had competitions to see whose maid could make better sculptures out of the towels. Your room will be decorated like a honeymoon suite every night. There are several restaurants at the Iberostar. All except two are outside. I live in Texas and am accustomed to heat in the summer, but when I sat down to eat outside, I was dripping with sweat. Not a pleasant dining experience. Guests are limited to the number of days they can dine at the indoor, air conditioned restaurants. Fortunately, my wife sweet-talked the gentleman taking reservations, and we ate in air conditioned comfort for 5 of 7 nights. Honestly, I would have left the resort if I was not able to dine in air-conditioning. It was absolutely awful. Unless of course you like your food salted by your own sweat. Also, beware of the poolside restaurant serving seafood. Its sanitation was sub par with insects all over many of its dishes. I believe this is where 4 of 6 of my traveling companions came down with an extremely violent illness, all having eaten the same dish, a seafood salad. My son suffered the worst of our traveling companions. After three days, he was emaciated and was nearly unable to walk. I called the front desk and they refused to send a golf cart to drive him to the medical desk, a 8-10 minute walk away. I feel that was inappropriate. The doctor prescribed a cocktail of Rx drugs, including two injections. I was very unsure of the man's ability to correctly diagnose my son, as the language barrier was difficult to cross (even though I nearly speak fluent Spanish). Fortunately, he must deal with the sickness often and my son was better before leaving the resort. The front desk staff were jerks. It was like pulling teeth to get them to help you. Everything you requested was a hardship for the \"overworked\" front desk staff. I have never been ignored like I was here. With all of this said, the property is beautiful, the beach was wonderful, the food...not so great...but acceptable. To be honest, I will not return to any Iberostar property. Better properties exist with much more accommodating staff. Try any \"palace\" property such as the Xpu Ha Palace, the Riu Palace, the Moon Palace, etc. All excellent with great food and attentive staff. For a more luxurious time, visit the Royal Hideaway Playacar by Occidental. The town of Playa del Carmen I truly love. Its simply better than Cancun. Make sure you visit Xel Ha Ecopark.

We were pleasantly surprised as our taxi pulled up to the lobby - it is gorgeous! Our room was in building 23, the closest building to the pool. Every morning, there were peacocks on our balcony! The beach is absolutely beautiful, if you walk out of the Iberostar area to the other hotel beaches, they are very eroded and have very little sitting area. People really seem to be piled on top of each other. The water is crystal clear, with white sand. And there is always a place to sit on the beach, even if you get there around 11 every morning, like we did. The pool chairs were always taken early in the morning, but the pool area gets soo hot without the ocean breeze, that we never sat by the pool, we only went in for dips. We found that even though the resort was booked, we never felt like it was crowded. We always had places to lay, amd to sit at the buffet. For fun, we went into Playa del Carmen three nights to go shopping and to go out to dinner. We took a tour of Tulum/Xel-Ha, which I found very interesting. There were two couples who brought young children, I would not reccomend bringing young kids to look at Mayan ruins. Xel-Ha was beautiful, and we could have spent the whole day there snorkeling and just walking around. On the last day, we went parasailing. It cost us $80, and we were only in the air for 10 minutes!! I would not do it again, but it was something I have always wanted to do, so it was worth it to me!! All in all, we had a wonderful time. We tipped the maids $3 a day, and our room was cleaned beautifully, and when my boyfriend asked for mas cervesa, we found 10 in our fridge (there are usually 4). We would definately return, and we are already planning all the different things we want to do when we return!!", "Date": "February 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cMuch more than I expected!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3229178", "Content": "I organized a group for my employer November 2004. Only a short 5day trip, but we had a wonderful time. Picked it on the combined recommendations of our TA and some coworkers who had been before. We had 87 people, mostly couples in their 30's & 40's, but also a few singles, some older couples (up to 60's) and a bunch of kids from infant to 16. That nobody had any serious complaints says a lot! Here's the good & bad: Grounds - fantastic! It really does look just like the pictures, with trees everywhere, birds and funky animals, waterfalls & ponds. Didn't see any monkeys, but others of the group did. Yes, the paths are rocky, and the slatted walkways on the Quetzal side caught your shoes. (On the other hand, I had warned my sister not to wear her heels. :) ) Yes, there's a fair distance to walk. But it's all very well laid out, and after the first day you won't get lost. It's all relaxing, you do get used to it, and how else do you plan to work off the food? Rooms - average +. I hadn't expected better, and for the price they were good value. Smallish, with a funky sort of stucco finish to the interior walls. Bathroom nice, but the door opened awkwardly. Nice big shower. Not a whole lot of closet shelving, and no bureau or other drawers. Plenty of room to hang things up, and the in-room safe is free. The double rooms are advertised as having two queen beds - they're really doubles. Mattresses hard, but no trouble sleeping. Limited tv, but we didn't miss it. Mini-fridge is drinks only, no snacks. Bottled waters were replenished. I always tip maid service, don't know if it made a difference. We had towel animals, rose petals etc all the time. Decent-sized balconies, if not the most private. Left the door open sometimes, no bug problems. Warning - the rooms blocks are three floors, with no elevators. We regretted not calling for luggage assistance before check-out. Food - Very good. I'm not a gourmet diner, but I'm not adventurous either. Buffets: they did have a lot of the same things out at every meal, but really - are you going to eat four entrees and five desserts at every meal? So what does it matter if yesterday's chicken is cooked the same way as today's? I just moved on to the next station. Again, for the price it was fantastic, and there was enough variety to keep it interesting. The wait staff were very friendly, even when we inadvertently kept them well past closing time. Some reviewers have complained about the openness (no walls or ac), but that absolutely made the place for us! Breakfast over your own waterfall! (At our last meal, as a small turtle swam by, my sister remarked she was going to start drinking her morning juice surrounded by potted plants and with the kitchen faucet running!) Unfortunately, the specialty restaurants weren't so great. We only went to one - the Mexican. The appetizer & dessert bar was good, but the entrees were very bland, with uninspired sides and presentation. This restaurant was fully enclosed, BTW, and felt very sterile in comparison. Ran into some of our group on the way out & they had the same opinion of the food. All our group really enjoyed the buffets, including the kids. Only one person sick that I heard of. Pools & beach - Awesome! And our previous visitors said the water compared unfavorably to their other visits. (Chalk that up to time of year.) The beach was very clean, if somewhat crowded. The sand...oh, the sand! Wandered down after dinner the first night and just stood there scrunching soft sand in my toes. Mm. Moving on. Bar service didn't come down to the loungers - I didn't care, but you might. Had no problems finding a spot. Water was gorgeous! I'm from So Cal and would have liked more waves; got some fun swells on the last day, nothing big but enough to be interesting. Didn't use any of the beach equipment, so can't comment. Saw no problems with beach vendors. Yes, lots of topless women and speedo-clad men. I was expecting it so I wasn't shocked, but I didn't like it. And since it's actually illegal in Mexico, it'd be nice if the European visitors would respect that. Ok, that's my soapbox. Pools - lovely...A little on the cold side, but again, you get used to it. Actually, the pools were pretty empty, and I don't think it was the temperature. The main pool has a wide zero entry spot opposite the beach, then narrows and circles around before widening out to another large, regular pool. Didn't go to the swim-up bar pool, but a lot of the group enjoyed it. The kid's wading pool is a pretty decent size, and the activity pool is just big enough for volleyball. Again, no trouble getting a spot. Bonus - pool restrooms exceptionally clean! Only one jacuzzi that I saw, and you have to swim through the pool to get to it. Doesn't heat up, as far as we could tell. Massages etc available poolside. Entertainment - Ok. never went to the disco. Drifted past the main show area a couple times, but they really weren't our cup of tea. Seemed rather amateurish, but in a good-natured way. If I hadn't been so tired at the end of each day we might have stayed for them, but we just wanted to sit somewhere quiet. Usually ended up at the buffet for night snacks. Offsite - Excellent, excellent, superb! Our TA arranged three tours for us, using Iberoservice. Not sure exactly how they're connected to Iberostar - contractor, sister company - but I highly recommend them. Our guides were friendly, knowledgable, accomodating; our rep Brian very understanding of our million questions, changes, special requests etc. Only two problems: first bus parked a little out of the way at the airport on arrival - I had to call Brian to find them. And they were 1/2 hour late to pick us up on our last day, but we were nowhere near close to missing our flights. Tours: 1) Golf: I know nothing about golf, but the golfers had fun. :) We had some trouble with the booking, but I think that was our TA, not IBService, who fixed it. 2) Xcaret - Excellent! Yes, it's very commercial, but everyone loved it, even we childless adults. If you do bring kids I highly recommend it, as an intro to what's in the area. So much stuff crammed into the place! We missed a lot of it, got lost, found the butterfly pavillion way too late in the day to do it justice...Ah well, shall just have to go back. IBService ran buses for us all day, so we had people coming and going as they liked. Sis & I stayed through the night show with the last wave of our group. I wasn't looking forward to the show, having heard about it, but it won me over - I enjoyed it in spite of myself. The first half, the Mayan history bit, really was moving. The second half, the Mexican culture sampler, was good fun. I really have come away from this trip with a new respect for Mexico. 3) Chichen Itza - Wow!!!! Kudos to guide Jorge! A lot of our group backed out of this when they heard about the 3 hour bus ride (one way). Let me tell you, it was worth it! IB's bus was big & comfortable, stocked with plenty of snacks and drinks, and Jorge kept up running commentary the whole way there. Yes, three hours! But he was interesting, really! Enough comedy and heckling (him heckling us!) to keep even the SoCal slackers entertained and listening to the serious stuff. He obviously cared about the place and subject, and when we got there it was so much more than just a trek through the ruins. Although that alone would have been very impressive. Nobody but nobody regretted signing up for this one. Arranged a very nice lunch at the adjacent hotel. Drove through a couple villages on the way there, asked him to stop on the way back so we could shop. Yes, that's touristy, but we're tourists, and these people are poor. Fortunately, no more talks - after that he played a DVD. :) Again, IBService very good with accommodating changes to their usual routine. That wouldn't help you if you're on your own, but good to know if you're putting a group together. The strip mall is a short walk from the hotel. Maybe could do better in Playa del Carmen itself, but we were happy with our purchases. Our group found plenty of other things to do in the area - dolphin swims, Tulum, etc. This really is an excellent location. Miscellaneous other - we had a lot of organizational trouble beforehand - i.e. arranging a private welcome dinner, trying to block out junior suites, etc. However, I can't prove it but I think they were more to do with our TA (who I won't be using again) than the IB. Once we arrived, everyone was very accommodating. The only real problem was at the very start - we had been booked into the Tucan, but discovered on arrival we'd been switched to the Quetzal side. Discovered it after the first busload was dropped off at the Tucan side! They had to schlepp their luggage themselves over to the Quetzal, where there was a big banner for our group etc. Not the most auspicious beginning, but all good from there. Only minor glitches, all quickly fixed (things like couple given double room instead of king, etc). Yes, lots of Europeans there. Other than the topless beach thing, no complaints. If I wanted to be surrounded by Americans I'd stay home! We don't speak Spanish and we had no problems. Try a few phrases, though, and they really appreciate it. (They'll laugh at you, but they'll appreciate it!) Please tip! Yes, it's an AI, but come on. They deserve it for just being so cheerful and patient with us. Would I go back? Probably. (I'd rather support the local restaurant owner than stay within an AI the whole vacation, but I can see the appeal of AI's.) If you do prefer AI's, I'd recommend the Quetzal without a second thought.

The staff was very friendly and let me just tell you that a $1.00 tip goes along way! They really appreciated it and it showed in your drinks(very strong!!) and in the way your room was cleaned everyday! The only downside I would say is that the food was not great at the buffets. The ala carte restuarants were great, but I am a picky eater and I could not find many things to eat there except for the french fries! The Japanese restuarant was great! Also, this is not the place to go if you are looking for any type of nightlife. We are ages 24 and 26, and we found ourselves back to our rooms by 8:00 pm or so, but we were tired anyways.

We spent our Honeymoon at the IBQ Jan 1-8th of 2005. My wife has never been out of the USA, and was a little nervous about going to Mexico. She was floored at how awesome this place is. We ate at all of the restaurants and the steakhouse twice, becuse of how damn good the tenderloin is. I have heard that if you know where to go you can get a delicious steak in Mexico. Well, I found one of those places. I have eaten at the Ruth's Chris' and the Charley's in Orlando. I will tell you now that this isn't as good, but it was close. At the buffets we both ate our hearts out, and I think we had a plate of dessert along with every meal. By the end we were just going in for the quesodillas and guacamole! The food was great and I can't say enough about the friendly staff. We always left 2 or 3 dollars on the table after meals, and it pays off quickly. I know it's supposed to be included, but we just took $100 in ones and they lasted us the entire time. (P.S. try the room service... it was really good, probably since it's made fresh) I have read some reviews about the cleaning services there and they have said that the maids didn't do a good job or whatever... I speak Spanish, so I was chatty with everyone including the maid, so she loved us and always had our room cleaned. We made it a point to wave to her in the hall and always left $2 for her. I even left my wedding ring out one day and she came and cleaned and just put it up on top of the TV. (Not reccommended) If you have traveled in Mexico in the past, you will know that it doesn't matter what hotel you stay at, the beds are always the same. I don't know why no one has figured this out yet. Anyway, because of the reviews, we brought an extra bag with bedding. We brought our mattress topper and two pillows. We slept wonderfully. If you are a couple you are allowed 2 bags each. I put all of my stuff in one suitcase and stuffed our bedding into a duffel bag. It worked out really well. The beach is just okay, but the rest of the resort more than made up for it. Great white sand, but the beach is too steep, so the waves break right on the sand, but no big deal. There were quite a few topless women, but just wear those dark sunglasses and no one will know you are looking :) (Trust me most you don't want to see!). There are tonz of Europeans. They are nice enough, but we couldn't really make many friends because of the language barrier. There are also a lot of families there, which could bother. We got sick on the way home, but it was from the sunset lobster cruise... I don't reccommend it. It's too expensive, and we ate the lettuce and everything they served. Things just arent as clean as they are at the IBQ. The jungle pathways are so great, and if you are looking for a romantic getaway, this place is really nice. By 8 or 9 at night, all the kids are in bed, and you can just roam around the resort and do whatever. We werent' huge fans of the star friends shows... they were too cheezy.

Our room was in block 25--midway between beach and lobby, on outside first level. The boys had a great time, enjoying the \"ice cream\" (more like ice milk) cones and \"virgin\" daiquiris and pina coladas at the beach/poolside bar. The zero entry on the beach side of the pool was perfect for our non-swimmer. The boys did well with the buffets and the beach side dining on the IB Tucan side was great fun. The ocean was too rough, even on relatively calm days, for either boy to go in without a firm adult hand very nearby. They loved getting knocked over by the waves, but the waves were nothing to be cavalier about. The kids' club is simple and small, located right next to a very shallow baby pool. The kids' club staff, while pleasant, often seemed a bit bored. The staff did best with kids who knew what they wanted and asked for it! Be aware--the staff deviate a lot from the posted schedule, so activities like beachcombing or jungle walks may be cancelled if the children do not ask for it. While my boys were too shy to dictate the schedule, they loved the down time in the afternoons with the movie and crafts after a morning of swimming. The occasional kids' movie at 6:30 p.m. on the huge screen in the entertainment hall was fun, but would be better at 5 p.m. when the kids are winding down from a day of sun before dinner time. The \"mini-disco\"--a time for parents to watch their kids play musical chairs or a Simon-Says style game--is at 8:15 p.m. and is simple, but fun for the little ones. My surprise pleasure was the lovely walk around the outside perimeter of the resort during the 9-11 p.m. time when most are watching evening entertainment. The path is stamped concrete and has enough of a breeze from the ocean to be quite pleasant, even though you're walking by the outside porches of the rooms. In all the nights there, I rarely saw more than one or two people on their porches. The little water glasses in the rooms are perfect for holding a votive/tea light candle--bring your own. My husband and I would sit on the porch while the boys went to sleep in the room, with the candles burnings on the patio table, and reading our books. The patio lights turn on automatically and cannot be turned off, but insects were not a problem while we were there. I would have liked the jungle view, but it was very noisy on the jungle-view side during the night show, and we are early-to-bed folks. Only problems: 1. Yes, beds are hard. No extra linens/pillows provided. 2. We had trouble with housekeeping NOT coming by two days in a row, even with multiple phone calls. And on another day, somebody came by to pick up the $2 daily tip we left, but no one cleaned the room that day until about 4-5 hours later. We were told after the second day of problems that if you want your room cleaned before siesta time, call housekeeping after you check in and let them know your preference. 3. We also had to call the front desk twice to fix the air conditioner, which will not run continuously if the patio door is open and our patio latch was malfunctioning. 4. We had a towel stolen from the beach--and the charge is $10 per lost towel. However, we told the front desk it had been taken from our beach chair and they did not charge us at check-out. We were pretty well sold on the \"mudslides\" at the front lobby bar. And the grilled prawns on Thursday night at the buffet were buttery and delicious. No one got sick, except perhaps from too much sun. A few close calls on the marble floors though, as they were slick when wet. And the inner paths through the jungle are treacherous at night, even for the non-inebriated. Overall a nice trip--lovely, distinctive grounds and pool.

We sat with Mariela the day after we arrived for about 30 minutes arranging the cake, flowers, location etc. It was so informal and stress free. There was a huge choice of cakes traditional and modern, we were spoilt for choice with flower designs. We decided to have our ceremony in the privacy of the jungle instead of the beach front as we are both quite shy and didn't want lots of onlookers. We were pleased when we did this as the beach front was very windy and difficult to walk on the sand in heels! We did have some photos taken there. The jungle ceremony was hot but so romantic, we only had 6 guests with us and we chose our own music throughout the ceremony. It was wonderful strolling through the jungle with my father to then see my groom and guests through the trees, a red carpet was laid out through the jungle for me right up to the wedding location! It was perfect with champagne table and waiters to celebrate. We were both excited and nervous as you would expect but it wasn't stressful at all for anyone. If anyone is thinking of this hotel - GO FOR IT! We can't stop thinking about it. Take some music with you if you wish to have your own personal songs on the day, not sure about the beach wedding but the jungle wedding will provide music. We also noticed with the beach weddings that they were very close to the volleyball pitch and sun bathers which to us, took away the romantic privacy of the whole thing, but each to their own. The wedding photographer was fantastic, quality was excellent, the album you get included wasn't very nice, basic, but we just bought our own on return to UK. The photographer allowed guests to take the same photo shots as her and never rushed us or told us what we had to do, basically she asked us what we wanted. I've noticed in the UK the wedding photograph will arrange the people in the photo shot but then moved them quickly after his photo so none of the other relatives can get the same or similar picture. This wasn't the case at the Quetzal. The weddings are always at 4 pm. We had set our heart on a morning wedding but when we got there we realised it would be too hot morning/noon and 4 pm the sun was cooling down a little, so we were happy to marry at 4 pm. There was also a lovely surprise in our room after the wedding, I won't tell you what it was as it will spoil the surprise if you are getting married!!

The have quite the variety - mexican of course at most meals...some the same and some different each time. Always lots of bread, pastries to die for. I loved the fresh donuts with filling and the kids loved the powdered rolls. I became attached to the Chiquiles at breakfast (like a mexican lasagna only with corn tortilla instead of noodles) and the bananna milk! The hostess kindly told me how they are made so I can try it at home. Several kinds of eggs every morning and always french toast- that was great, pancakes and waffles. Omelets made special for you. The wait staff were friendly and excellent. We usually ate lunch by the pool. The paella party was great, they always had hot dogs and burgers as well as a whole line of other buffet items. There was always some place to eat or snack open. We ate at the steakhouse which was great. We also ate at the Bonsai Japanese, which was good too, it does take a while and they were somewhat disorganized but it was good. Our seafood night we had shirmp not lobster, but these shrimp were HUGE and the best I have had, sweet and I thought they were about as close to lobster as you could get. The rooms were nice, and the only time we spent there was to sleep. Which brings me to mention, the beds, they are firm but I thought they were comfortable. I was so tired each night I could have slept on the tile floor. Maids did a great job, cute towel art. I left 2.00/day plus a gift of make-up etc. I heard they liked that. The resort was spotless, there were friendly folks working constantly to keep it nice. We loved the jungle, the animals. One day we had 8 monkeys above us in the trees. Very neat to watch. The resort peole bring the Parrots and the Iguanas around to the pool and beach and take photos and sell them in the photo shop. Those are my favoriye photos even if they were 7.00/ea.

My kids are 8 and 12. The 8 yr old did go several times and participated in the play Grease. It was the cutest thing!!! He had a blast. They played tennis, never had a problem getting a court, basketball, air rifle contest, ping pong. They met kids from all over. Had a wonderful time / we were there from dec 13-19. It was not crowded until the last 2 days. Then the holiday crowd showed up. The weather was great, just right low 80s and a nice breeze. We had 2 red-flag days where there were no water sports. I would recommend if you want to do watersports, you do them the first chance you get because you never know if the next day will be a red flag day. We signed up for parasail/reef snorkel/bananna boat at the white kiosk on the far left side of the property. (red and white sign) We only paid 58.00 pp for a parasail/snorkel/bananna boat combo. Which was cheaper than other offers. Parasail was awesome. SNorkel would have been but it got rough while we were out there and visability wasnt good. They kindly let me trade bananna boat for paddle boat so I could let my youngest enjoy as well. If you want to catamaran on property, if you dont have experience you must take a lesson for 38.00 then you can do it for 1 hr per day each day. I recommend you take the class at the beginning of the week then you can take advantage of your time to use the boat. Pool water was cool, hot tub same temp as pool. Ocean water was warmer than pool. It rained a few times for a short while but nothing bothersome. We took a cab into Playa twice. 4USD each way. There are also shops 5 min walk away. We ate ice and drank on the property all week, NO PROBLEM with tummy aches!!! I definitely recommend this for families. Not really for honeymooners as much . I wouldnt recommend high heels as they may get stuck in the teakwood walkways. I dont wear them, just a bit of advice. I really enjoyed this. It was my first experience with all inclusive. Its the only way to go escpecially w kids!!! I would go back in a minute. I think as far as the resort property the next place I go will seem like the Super 8!!!

Entertainment is good but hokey (my kids loved it) 8. The facitilities are all open air (wonderful in the winter) maybe not in the summertime! 9. The location in playacar. Closer to Playa, not too far from Xel Ha, Tulum & Xcaret. The not so good: 1. The rooms are just OK. Extremely hard beds, a \"matress\" on a concrete base (my back still hurts). (Marble tile floors not kid safe) 2. There are no handrails and some high stairs (for those of you with children) 3. No restaurant has an Carribean sea view. 4. Various items like disposeable cameras and sunscreen are very expensive. 5. Internet access and phone calls (even local) are very expensive. The Bad: 1. My two children, my wife and I all got very very sick from the food or water. My kids were both throwing up all night for the last two nights. We all have nausea, vomiting & the other end too. We ate and drank ONLY at the resort. The plane ride back was a nightmare (you can imagine) because of this. 3 days later, and we're still not right. I am not sure if it was the water, fruit or what. They say it's safe to eat everything and drink the water. Well, not for us. 2. Our $500 digital camera was stolen towards the end of our stay. Along with all of the pictures of our kids the sights etc. We are very upset about this. Apparently I should not have set it down in the restroom while my 4 year old was getting sick. We can't imagine another guest paying good money to stay there would have stolen it (they all bring there own cameras). If you go, gaurd your belongings! Summery: After reading the reviews for a long time it is obvious that you just can't make some people happy. We are not like that at all. Until the whole family got sick and our camera was stolen we were having a great time. We loved the area and a lot of things about the resort.

I have been to this area 4 times and this was the first to Quetzal. Very nice place. Very jungular. (a phrase we coined wile there). Very crowded but what do you expect I guess. The beach was great however the farther away from the Quetzal end the better. Seemed like people were swarming that end more. We thought the food was very good but were sad that we missed the seafood night at the buffett. I still can't figure out how people complain about the food. They must really be used to eating at 5 star restaurants all the time. The people are so nice at all of the Iberostars. Always friendly and helpful. Loved the seperate pool bar. The entertainment needs a facelift. All four times down here at four seperate Iberostars had virtually the same exact shows. I could pretty much talk along with the acts because they were that familar. My wifes only complaint is about the walkways through the jungle. Very dark at night and quite uneven. No big deal for me but she didn't care for that. We loved the fact that you could walk to a shopping area and feel safe about it. I like the fact that this property is grouped together with some other very nice hotels and gated off. We did a dive excursion to Cozumel that was fabulous too. really no complaints about anything. Everyone at the hotel was offered a free 2 night upgrade to the brand new Iberostar Maya which is the other half of Lindo. They paid for our cab and transferred our lugguge. We were able to leave from there on our departure day instead of Quetzal so it was closer and bought us some more drinking time before leaving.

The grounds with tropical atmosphere and the monkeys and animals you see daily along the covered paths are reason enough to come visit. The rooms are adequate. Nice walk in showers, no bath tub which we did not care about. The beds are hard as mentioned on other reviews. What is not mentioned is the pillows. Very firm and flat. If this is not your idea of comfort, I suggest you bring your own. We requested and stayed in bldg 25 facing the interior. It is halfway between the pool and the main restaurant. The food was not as good as we remembered 2 years ago. It was pretty much the same buffet every night. Although there is a good variety, it gets old after 3 or 4 days. The reservation restaurants are average. My wife ordered veal marsala at the italian restaurant. The veal was really flank steak made to look like veal. The wine is all mexican and not very good. The wait staff makes up for a lot however with there politeness and effort. The pool drinks are great. Try a dirty monkey. Vodka, banana, creme de cocoa and who knows what but it tastes great. One thing we noticed this time is the amount of europeans that come to this place. Many russians and poles, who do not speak much english. It is not an upscale crowd, but we found most people friendly. Our kids had a great time and especially enjoyed the nightly shows by the staff (star friends). Adults will find these shows very dated, but the drinks are free. To sum up. You will have a great time at this place. It is beautiful, friendly, and a relaxing place to hang out for without fretting about where to go to eat and find things to do with your kids. One note, we stayed at the iberostar lindo last year. Much more upscale and better food. However, we felt is was not as intimate as the quetzal or tucan (its exactly the same place but opposite side). At the lindo be prepared to do much more walking and it is also a long cab ride to playacar or playa del carmen. Don't stay at the paraiso, its a dump compared to the quetzal.

The water is turquoise, the sand is white, and you can play in the waves all day without getting bored. One of the coolest things is that the resort is built right into a jungle-like atmosphere, so you see things like flamingos, large turtles, and toucans while you walk around the resort. We even saw some monkeys on our last day (they were small and very cute, but seemed afraid of us humans and kept their distance). Also, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly and everything is very clean. We tipped the staff very well, even though it's not required. The only things that were less-than-excellent were the hard mattresses in the rooms, and the paths that go through the resort weren't very well-lit at night so it was hard to see when you were walking around after dark. Be warned that there are quite a few topless women at the beach, and many of them are women you DON'T want to see topless (like 70 year old women or those who are significantly overweight). You also see a lot of thongs on people who should not be wearning them! I got used to it after a couple of days. Overall, the place is wonderful and I would definitely go back!

The room was fine with the exception of the beds being very hard. It is on concrete. The airconditioned work well in the room. My main complaint is with the food. It seemed that the food was \"recycled.\" For instance on the dessert buffet, there would be a filled roll that would have a peach on it one night, the next night it would have a strawberry, the next night a mandarin orange... There was not a lobster night like there was at the Iberostar Parasio. There were very few shrimp served. At the Parasio there were grilled shrimp at least a couple of nights - not at the Quetzal though. The Italian restaurant was okay, but not anything special. The desserts were basically the same as the main buffet restaurant. While I was there, I got a little sick from something. I was very careful to watch what I ate and drink, but I still ended up with stomach problems. On a positive side, the beach is one of the most beautiful that I have ever seen.

The hotel and the grounds were beautiful. we could not believe we were staying in such a tropical setting.Our rooms were spotless and comfortable and our maid made us some wonderful models using the towels. The whole place was kept very clean. The beach was amazing and we had no trouble in getting a bed and umbrella. The cigarette ends on the beach were not so good and people should be told if they do not use the bins provided.The pool area was fantastic. Plenty of room for swimming or just lazing around. The water was clean and clear if a little warm!! We in England prefer it a little cooler as it is more refreshing. The wedding was on 6th September and it was a joyous day.All the arrangements were great and the Ceremony was very emotional. The Wedding took place on the Beach at 5.00p.m. and it was still hot.We had a lovely time and the staff in the Mexican Restaurant were happy and helpful and looked after our every need,which included downing copious amounts of Tequila!! The bride and Groom received lovely flowers and a sweet Wedding Cake. Everything was superb. We loved spotting all the wildlife and were lucky enough to see the Monkeys quite often during our first week. We did not spot them at all the second week but we thought that they knew Hurricane Ivan was on its way and they went deeper into the jungle to shelter. The Hotel did warn us the Hurricane was on its way and took all the precautions necesssary to ensure we were all safe. In the end Ivan passed us by and we gained an extra day in the Hotel which pleased us immensely!! The buffet in both Hotels was very good but we tend to agree with other people that after the first week it was becoming boring. We ate out a couple of times and found that a nice change. The food all in all was good, just not enough variety, especially the second week. The star friends worked really hard to keep people entertained and we went to quite a lot of the evening shows but here again the entertainment was always the same. It was a shame some evenings as the showes were very amateurish at times even though they had spent a long time rehearsing. They do need to update their routines and perform something a little more modern.The same could be said for La Mascara Disco. The D J played the same songs all the time and did not do any requests. Even on the Wedding Day he could not find anything romantic for the Bride and Groom to dance to.He really needs to review his record collection and update it for next season!!

In Playacar are several all-inclusive resorts (Riu Palace, Riu Yucatan, Riu Tequilla, Wyndam resort, Rio, Iberostar Tucan/Quetzal, and a couple others) and a little strip mall you can walk to. Since it's a gated area, it's quite safe to be out at all hours. We stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal, which is really the Quetzal/Tucan, as they are two halves (literally) of the same resort. Pros: - very friendly staff, spoke English very well - grounds were wonderfully landscaped, with lots of vegetation and animals (flamingos, peacocks, monkeys, tucans, etc.) - pool was beautiful, huge, warm, and wonderful - beach was clean, sandy - ocean was seaweed-free, warm and beautiful - food was quite good, 7/10. 6pts for quality and +1 for consistency - short ride to downtown Playa del Carmen (<5 min) Cons: - bed was hard - mattress on concrete. no boxspring. - only 2 of the 6 restaurants (4 rest. + 2 buffets) were air conditioned. - drinks were very weak by default. - minibar in room was not stocked with alcohol - internet access was limited to a pay-per-minute machine in the lobby Personally, I did not mind the bed. I prefer firm sleeping quarters. Since we were almost never in the room, the lack of alcohol in the minibar was a non-issue for us. The lack of good, cheap internet access was unfortunate, but not a major issue. Weak drinks were simply fixed by asking to make the drinks strong (e.g. \"Pina Colada please, with 2 extra shots of rum.\"), or by ordering drinks that really can't be made weak (e.g., tequilla shot, Grateful Dead, Long Island Iced Tea, etc.). The lack of A/C was the only big issue for me, as the weather is consistently in the upper 80's-low 90's with high humidity. The other nice benefit is that you can visit all the other Iberostars. We took a day trip to Cozumel (which I would not recommend to anyone), and wound up spending the afternoon at the Iberostar Cozumel. I also looked at the Riu Palace Mexico, which is on the same street as the Iberostars. The Palace was gorgeous, but different than the Iberostar. They are analagous to Vegas' Bellagio and Mirage hotels, respectively. The Palace was, well, palacial: very grand, very formal looking, roomy and elegant (much like the Bellagio). The Iberostars were more tropical, outdoors-y and were better lanscaped. Overall, I'd give the experience 4/5. PS If you go to PDC, you *have* to go on the Alltournatives Coba ruins tour. You get to rapel down into a cenote, zipline over a cenote, swim in a clearwater cenote, visit the Mayan ruins in Coba, eat an authentic Mayan lunch, and take a quick kayak ride.", "Date": "October 5, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAmazingly Beautiful!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2597445", "Content": "This resort will exceed your expectations!

Everyone was always smiling and upbeat, trying to make your stay as enjoyable as they could. We stayed in 2203 which was perfectly located near the pools and the beach. The hotel on the other side was a little noisy at night but we were tired after long days of water and sun and had no problem falling asleep in the hard, but comfortable beds. The room was small, but we really did not use it for much more than sleep. We left the room each day by about 8-9 am and it was clean with towel art and chocolates to boot by the time we arrived back. The fridge was stocked with orange soda, sprite, coke and diet coke along with water, beer and seltzer water everyday. We left a tip, about $2 a day for Carlos. No bugs in the room. The hotel grounds were a little confusing the first day, but we found our way quickly. My son, 11, loved all the animals; parots, monkeys, cat-like animals with no tails??, peacocks, flamingos, ducks and their babies, turtles and lizards. He made us stop every five feet and look at some critter. My daughter favored the pool, which is huge, and my son loved the bright blue ocean and the waves. Water was perfect to play in. Pool water was bath-water warm and very clean. We ate in the Italian and the Steakhouse both were very good. The buffet was good, and had a slightly different theme each night. The wait staff couldn't have been nicer, we also tipped them each night. Our trip was through Fun Jet and someone was at the desk each day to help us or answer questions. We booked two trips thru them, the Xel-ha day trip and a half-day trip with ATV's and speedboats. Xel-ha was fun and interesting, the ATV/speedboat was okay, wouldn't do it again, it cost $50 per person, including transportation and a soda afterward. Xel-ha was about $265 for the whole family, all-inclusive and transportation. Playacar mall was nice and within walking distance. Playa del carmen only a $4 taxi ride each way and easier to barter if that is what you would like to do. Hair braiding definatly cheeper. My daughter,12, has hair a little past her shoulders and the hotel spa said $90 for her whole head. A very nice lady downtown was $30 with no bargining and took about an hour. Nice job. The kids also got henna tatoos for $10 a piece at Playacar mall, we got these the day before we left, but he said we could of come back and had them touched up before we left otherwise. Vanilla was $6 for the largest bottle at the hotel giftshop and 5 for the next smaller size, cheapest I found. Ceramics to paint at the hotel cost 25-35 dollars depending on the piece. We really did not get time to do this but looked like fun. Go keep an open mind and try to get to a show or two.

I am very picky both about cleanliness and atmosphere, and I have to say it was the most spectacular vacation we have ever had. HIGHLIGHTS GROUNDS: The grounds are simply breathtaking...truly a tropical paradise and immaculately maintained. I loved the jungle atmosphere, and since my son is an animal lover, he got a huge kick out of seeing all the wildlife roaming the property. We spotted the monkeys twice in the trees near Building 23. BEACH: While other guests have complained in previous reviews that the \"towel game\" was in full force, we never had a problem locating chairs. I think the management has dealt with the problem, because there some info in our welcome packet specifically asking people not to reserve spots. The water was crystal clear and the beach was very clean. SERVICE: The staff was almost unanimously cheerful and polite and greeted every request with a smile. I had read previously that the employees make just $5 a day, and confirmed this with one of our waiters at the lunch buffet (actually he said he makes $4.89 a day), so I tipped generously throughout the week, although it is certainly not expected. The employees work so very hard and were so appreciative. My feeling is that a couple of hundred extra bucks to me doesn't make that much difference when I am already spending thousands on a vacation--but to the staff it really makes a difference. ACTIVITIES: I generally don't like group stuff, but the Iberostar has the formula just right: you can do as much or as little as you like with other guests. I would have liked to get in a merengue or salsa class, but it seemed every day was packed with other things to do. Also, the Star friends and the emcees of the show are so friendly and warm that they make everyone get into the spirit and let loose and have fun. My husband and I actually got talked into going up on stage one night and participating in a rock-and-roll dance contest...and we are NOT dancers! I can't even get him to slow dance with me as a rule! FOOD: Since I am not a big fan of buffets, I found the food to be ok. Some of it was simply prepared differently than I am used to. There is such an amazing spread for the breakfast and lunch buffets, though, that you can always find something to eat. LOWLIGHTS: Warning: if you rent a beach umbrella or towels, make sure you return them before the office closes! We spent our last afternoon on the beach, and my husband lugged them them all the way from the beach to the office around 7:00 p.m. but they were closed. He wanted to drop them off at the front desk, but was told no. Instead they told him to return them the next morning, which was a hassle because he had to carry them all the way back to the room that night, then get up early the next day and return them when we were trying to get to the airport. Smokers: I knew from reading website reviews that Iberostar is a European resort, so I expected to see smokers, but I still found it very annoying to watch so many of them simply flick their cigarettes on the ground. I wish the hotel would impose and enforce a \"No littering\" rule. It's rude no matter what language you speak! SUMMARY Because I like to experience new things, I have never wanted to go back to the same place twice. The Iberostar was the first place I would definitely go back to.

My family and I have been to many, many AI resorts of the sort, and this was the best yet. My dad says that even Sandals doesn't compare. I have no complaints whatsoever, and would go back to this resort in a heartbeat. The food is great. If you cannot find something to eat, you're too picky. I admit - I'm a finicky eater, but I never went hungry. They had wonderful breakfasts (my fav meal of the day) with hash browns, omelets, sausage, pancakes, donuts, etc. and the French fries at the buffets tasted like the ones from McDonalds. The resort was SPOTLESS and the grounds were breathtaking. Our favorite hangout was the pool bar and the disco at night. At both of these places, we met tons of people from all over the place. The wildlife around the resort was fun, too. As I'm sure you've heard, they have monkeys, which we saw every day (usually by buildings 23, 24, or 25 or behind the towel hut), and they're not hard to spot. You really don't even have to go looking for them. They also have flamingos, the cutest little ducks you could ever see, geese, peacocks, a tucan, parrots, iguanas, a tortoise, and these strange looking rodents called agoutis. The bar service was EXCELLENT. Our favorite bartenders were Gaspar in the lobby, Raul Alberto in the pool bar, and Eduardo at the disco bar and the nightly entertainment bar. We also thought the Star Friends were excellent. They really encouraged guests to participate, and we became such good friends with several of them (Mirsha and Alberto) that we exchanged email addresses. The pool was massive - it looked like the 8th sea! I would highly recommend this resort to anyone looking for a good time.

We were placed in BLd. 23- and it was perfect. I had also requested our dinner reservations by email, and that was done very graciously. The towel-chair saving was never an issue unless of course you don't get up until 11:oo. there always seemed to be chairs to grab- but if you are really ambitious you can get up at 7 and save one of the cabana's- well worth it for a day. We saw the monkeys everyday- heard them evry night- they and all the wild life were so fun to see and added so much to the resort. Meals were good- can't imagine you can't find something you like at any buffet. We had reservations at the Steak and the Italian- both were very good..

Our oldest daughter was married the week before so we decided to take the rest of our family, daughter, 23, and son, 16 for a much needed relaxing but fun vacation. We took a charter through GWV and had a great experience. They met us at the airport and transported us to the resort in a very comfy air conditioned bus and offered us Corona's,( $3.00 ). They were fantastic. We found them to be personable and very helpful and organized. The resort lobby is beautiful and large with a bar and a few shops to buy snacks, books, sundries etc., a jewelry store, and a clothes store with t-shirts, bathing suits and wraps etc. The people were very friendly at check in and gave us building 25, pretty much in the middle of the resort on the 1st floor. Unfortunately, we booked our trip last minute and got the last available room. We would have liked to book a second room but there were none left. We were a little disappointed in our room. It was smaller than expected with two double beds and a small couch. The bathroom door was awkward, opening in instead of out. We had a minibar stocked with bottled water, beer, and soda and a TV with a few english speaking channels. There was a nice little patio area with a small table and two chairs but it was too hot to take advantage of. There was not much in the way of storage space. There are no drawers to put clothes, only a closet with some shelves. The room was very clean, and maid service was exceptional. Everyday we were entertained by the towel animals and we loved the chocolates and turn down service. We called for an iron and they came quickly and left it for 3 days before it vanished after maid service. We ordered room service twice and we received it quickly and with a smile. The jungle was really unique and a lot of fun. I found myself getting up and out by 6:30 so I could see a lot of monkey action. It was a really peaceful time to walk through the jungle on the way to the dining room for a cup of coffee. Considering the size of the resort, I was surprised there were few people up at this time. It was a nice time to walk on the beach or sit with a book and take in the beauty of the ocean. By 9:00 the rest of my family was up and we made our way to the breakfast buffet. This was our favorite meal of the day. They have everything from omelets, french toast, pancakes to an unbelievable array of fresh fruits and juices and pastries. The waiters are so attentive and always remember you. It's fun to ask questions and learn a little more about them. One of our waiters was expecting a call any minute to find his wife in labor! We were so excited for him. He was beaming! We were told by our tour group to make our dinner reservations the first day we arrived because they book up quickly. We made reservations at the steak restaurant and the tropical restaurant by the beach. Both of these are not air conditioned but the only restaurants that men do not need to wear long pants. My son forgot to bring long pants and we did not want to go out and buy a pair just to go to the Italian or Mexican restaurants. We really looked forward to these reservations because as varied as the buffets are, they get tiresome after a while. We enjoyed the tropical restaurant. My husband enjoyed the grouper which was excellent, both my children ordered a chicken dish which they really liked and I had the striped bass which was just OK. The steak restaurant was good. We all had the tenderloin. I got a kick out of the country music they were playing during dinner. One tip about going to dinner. Don't bother getting there early because they won't let you in one second before your reservation. The beach was the most beautiful I have ever seen. Turquois water, white soft sand and gentle waves. Waitresses come around and take drink orders. There are a few topless people around but no one seemed to be bothered by it. The bartenders are really friendly and aim to please. They'll make anything you want and any strength you want it. You can borrow beach umbrellas from the towel stand or if you get there early enough you can snag a hut. The pool is also very nice but the water was very warm and not as refreshing as the ocean. Activities are varied and there is something for everyone. My husband and son enjoyed the rifle shooting , pool and ping pong, water polo. My daughter and I took salsa lessons and painted ceramic bowls by the pool. Most nights we went to the show which starts at about 9:30 but it is wise to get there by 9:00 if you want a good table. I can't say enough about the Star Friends who have boundless energy and a lot of talent. I would encourage everyone to participate in some of the pool, beach or nightly participation activities. They are a lot of fun and a good way to meet people from all over the US and overseas. The Star Friends do a great job encouraging participation. We took the Xel-ha/Tullum tour which was great but very hot! We loved the snorkeling at Xel-ha and our tour guide Victor was entertaining and informative. The Tullum tour was short which was good because of the extreme heat and not much shade. The ruins are beautiful to look at right on the ocean. We left the resort at 8:30 and returned about 6:00. We also took a cab into Playa del Carmen one evening and walked down to the water and had dinner at Senor Froggs. It was a lot of fun and the food was great and reasonable. We ate about 6:30 prior to the wild crowd coming in for a night of tequila shots! We had a wonderful vacation but we would probably go at a different time of year when it's not quite as hot. The lobby and the buffet pavilion are not air conditioned and they can be a little uncomfortable, even with overhead fans.

In short, this was the best vacation of our lives! This was our third time in the Riviera Maya, previously stayed at the RIU Yucatan and the Barcel\u00f3 Maya. Both trips had their downsides, but the third time was a charm- no problems whatsoever, either in the transportation or the accommodations! We booked through Funjet and flew out of O\u2019Hare on Transmeridian (exit row seating both ways!!). Our arrival at Cancun was a thing of wonder- no lines at Immigration- we went right through and got a green light through Customs (does anyone get a red light- I\u2019ve never seen it ?). Once outside, found the Lomas guy quickly and he directed us to our van. Transport to the resort was quick- only one other stop before the IB Q/T. Check in was quick, efficient and friendly, with a much-needed welcome drink. The bellman shuttled us and our luggage with a high-speed golf cart ride (NASCAR should give these guys a call) to bldg 2200. This was a great location, very close to the pool and beach. I had emailed in advance requesting a king bed and to my surprise we got it! I couldn\u2019t believe that everything was going so good. We got settled in and then explored the resort- FANTASTIC!! The grounds were designed to mimic a jungle setting and were very lush. We were very impressed with the animal population- flamingoes, spoonbills, peacocks, quetzals, iguanas and agoutis. We did see a monkey on our second day, but that was it. The room was very nice and the bed was not as hard as the Yucatan or the Barcel\u00f3. Housekeeping was fantastic, minibar refilled every day and towel sculptures as well. One thing that impressed me about this place over the Barcel\u00f3 was the simple fact that the tile throughout the resort was not slippery. When we are at the Barcel\u00f3 last year, I could not find any kind of footwear that would not slide on the tile! In order to keep this report to a manageable length, I will use subject headings for the remainder: Resort- The IBQ had absolutely the best staff of anyplace we\u2019ve been so far (Mexico, Caribbean or USA). Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. I cannot say enough in this regard. They are to be complemented on their efficiency and professionalism. Food- We found the food very good. The buffet was great, and the Mexican restaurant was OK. The steakhouse was very good. The beach grills were excellent for a lighter breakfast or lunch Bars- Very friendly bartenders and servers. No problems getting top-shelf liquor! We really enjoyed the lobby bars. Entertainment- We generally don\u2019t go to the shows on the resort, but we went to the show 5 nights out of 7 this time. They ranged from very entertaining to pretty hokey. The Mr. Iberostar show is not to be missed! Pool & Beach- The pool was the best we\u2019ve ever seen, very large with 2 zero-entry sections. No problem getting loungers by the pool at all! I thought the beach was fine, not as large as the Barcel\u00f3, but not having all that rock/coral more than made up for the smaller size. Our typical day was spent going from the beach to the pool to the bar and back again, repeat as necessary! We went to Yal-Ku lagoon by cab for snorkeling. It was OK, I guess I expected more. It seemed rather limited in the number and types of fish compared to Xel-Ha, but it was nice in the fact that we had the place to ourselves until a tour group came in as we were getting out. We went to Xcaret by cab two days later and found it a very enjoyable experience. The snorkeling was not bad, considering the limited size of the area and the other attractions were very interesting. I must admit I was impressed, from what I\u2019ve read, I was expecting a Mayan Disneyland; the park was very low-key and well done! We had dinner in PDC on our last night- it was good to get off the resort for a meal. This vacation was the best one we\u2019ve ever had! It was badly needed by both of us and was to be a low-stress trip; no pre-arranged agenda, just chilling out.

Both the Steak and Italian restaurants were booked by the time we tried to get reservations on day 2 of our trip. We ended up eating at the Tripical theme restaurant. Don't bother. The buffet was better. Henry, the bartender at the lobby bar, makes the best Mojito this side of Cuba. The pool and beach areas were beautiful but warn your children they may see topless ladies on the beach. Tops are required poolside. We spent one day under a palapa by the pool and another under a palapa by the beach. Very relaxing. The hotel has many excursions to offer in addition to the water sports and diving. We were even offered a free dive lesson.

June 26th. I read many reviews before I booked this resort and so I thought I should write my own. This was our third trip to Mexico. We have been to the Moon Palace, which is a very beautiful and new resort with a horrible beach area. If you want a good beach, I suggest you do NOT go to Moon Palace. It was too big for us! Last year my husband, daughter and I stayed in Cancun at the Beach Palace. It is small with about 250 rooms. We really like this family resort and the beach at this resort is fabulous! The rooms are a little outdated, but we had fun anyway. The Iberostar Quetzal Resort: We stayed on the Quetzal side and it was absolutely beautiful! The Tucan side of the resort seemed just as nice and more European. The resort has a nice mix of adults and children from the USA and all around the world. The resort is gorgeous (I think I mentioned this already...) the grounds are very well kept and the service was excellent. Typically I am not big on the animal thing...I prefer the beach and pool. But the tropical setting was so pretty and relaxing. The children like the animals - makes things more interesting. The walks are easy... a little uneven rocky steps, but it is such a neat experience. I tried to wear some heals with a dress one night and I had to take my shoes off to walk. I was concerned the resort might be bigger than what we like but it was just perfect in size. There is a smell - sometimes - this is the Mexican sewer system and I have smelled this at other resorts. We got over it, as we just wanted to have some fun in the sun. ROOMS: My family and I were in Playa del Carmen for 7 nights. My husband, daughter, mother and myself had room 2141 and my sister, husband and two boys were in room 2149. Both were great locations as this building is 2nd from the ocean. The first building is the Jr. Suites, but from my understanding they are the same room size with ocean front views. However, our room (2141) had a very nice ocean view and we were very close to the beach and pool! I liked being on the third floor so we walked off the mucho food and cerveza's. This is what we requested and we got it!!! I believe that we would have been a little disappointed to be back by the hotel entry. The beds are hard, but we managed to get sleep. After so much tequila and beer and sun - you should be so tired you will go to sleep. The beds have been hard at both other resorts in Cancun. I think this is just the way it is there. The room could have been a bit bigger but the couch could be another bed. The bathroom was pretty nice and the shower was large!!! The fridge will eventually get cold if you leave it shut for a day. We did leave tips and make-up samples for the maid each day and we always had plenty of water, cokes and beer. Sometimes we had to ask for extra wash clothes and towels. We were happy with the room and we had a great view and location! POOL: Excellent pool, the best! IT was clean, plenty of room and we never had a problem getting a chair. Bring FLOATS!! Everyone asked, \"Where did you get the float?\" I told them I brought with. Just inexpensive $2- $3 so you can leave them with someone who didn\u2019t' bring one. I felt very safe letting our children 9-12 run around the pool area, swimming getting snacks, cokes and ice creams. It is very safe and family oriented. But the adults can have fun too! DRINKS: The drinks were good. I heard some review say the drinks were watered down. NOT TRUE! Although you need to make friends with the bartenders and ask for the brand of liquor you prefer and just tell them to add a shot or whatever. They will do it in a heartbeat... not questions..no problems. I did get drunk one night - that was a fun walk from the disco. The staff is excellent. I did give a tip everyone once in a while. They do not expect it though. I just thought they deserved it. Entertainment: The Star Friends are so talented. I thought they did a good job. If you watched the show every night it may get old, but they work really hard and are so nice. The area where the stage is nice and has a great bar. There are pool tables and the kids can just \"hang out\". I let my girl run around the area and we all felt very safe. The disco is mostly younger. My 9 yr old loves to dance so we took her one night and the DJ plays good mix of dance, hip hop, a little 70's and 80's mixed in. I am 35 and I still like to dance. So we had fun. FOOD: I thought it was pretty good most of the time. One night they had lobster and it was very GOOD. We ate at the Mexican and the seafood. We did get to try the steakhouse but I heard it was very good. We ate in town one night for a change. La Parrilla - this was a very good place to eat and not too expensive. The last day when we were shopping we had a snack at Senior Frogs. Quesadillas were very good. IT is not expensive and on the very nice beach. Trip to Cozumel: The ferry was fun and very nice. We went snorkeling at Chankanaab Park and this was very good for snorkeling. My daughter and husband did the dolphin swim ($125 a person) but worth it as you don't do this every year. We purchased the video for $49, which was a bit much if you ask me. Well you might as well have the video too. The dolphins are so cool. I am glad they did it and I watched. We visited the Iberostar in Cozumel after and we did NOT like it at all. The beach at the Iberostar Cozumel is terrible and the mosquitoes were so bad! We were only there for 1 hour and then went back the ferry. The cabs are kind of $$ pricy in Cozumel. But it's a vacation!

I would recommend this resort to anyone. However great the resort was the charter flight with North American was completely disappointing. It began the day my girlfriend and I arrived in Cancun in May 2004. We planned this trip through GWV on a charter and we were supposed to get transportation from Cancun airport to the Iberostar resort when I realized that my luggage was not there. We searched for an hour or so and spoke with the baggage claim attendants, which was difficult to do with none available for a while. To make a long story short, I did not get my luggage, which was thought to have been swapped with someone else\u2019s and was located in the Dominican Republic and hoped to be delivered to me the next day. Unfortunately for me the luggage did not arrive until Thursday evening that week on my vacation, which was from Saturday to Saturday. Due to the airline's mistake, I had to purchase everything from clothing to personal items to survive the week. To make the story better I planned to propose to my girlfriend the evening we arrived in a romantic setting after dinner on the beach during sunset. This didn't happen because I had to go to town to shop for clothes. All week I was on a schedule to visit GWV to check on the status of my luggage, sometime even twice per day. As a result I could not relax or plan my vacation, as I would like to have. When I returned home I wrote a letter concerning my issue and contacted North American Airlines for re-imbursement of the items that I purchased and the compensation of my time wasted on a daily schedule while on vacation because of their mistake. The airline did not care much about my lost time, they nickel and dime me to not pay for their clear mistake. Needless to say I personally wrote a letter and spoke on the phone to the President of North American Airlines and not mentioning names he simply put it sorry for the inconvenience but I agreed to pay for the items purchased while on vacation but no other compensation was given.

We will be there July 13-17, 2004 after a 4 day stay at the Gran Porto Real north of the Ferry Dock. Some of my fondest memories of the resort were the lush gardens, clean beach, our favorite bartenders Luis and Clemente(look them up, they are still there) Luis is in the Quetzal lobby in the evening and Clemente is in the Theatre during the performances at night. For that matter, all of the staff at the Quetzal were fantastic. As far as the restaurants go, the buffet has more to do with your company than anything else. There is plenty of selection, certainly enough for you to try different things every day. The steakhouse was excellent. When we went, the swim-up bar was not in place yet, just a small adult pool with a waterfall. And boy was it cold. We'll see if it's warmed up now. I am also happy to see that they have some top shelf liquor now. We will certainly drink our share. I was not impressed with the Superior beer in the minibars in the rooms. People laugh when I tell them that Superior is inferior, but it was the truth. I work for a brewery, so maybe it's because I am more accustomed to tradional style ales, but that's just my taste. We did take a trip to Cozumel, and had a lot of fun at Carlos'n'Charlies. We were a little bugged by all of the people hassling you to come into their stores.

We were told that we were arriving befor peak season. We'll go back the same time. We had a great time! We have never been on an all-inclusive, 5 star resort. I travel alot and at times to 5 star hotels. I wondered what a 5 star all-inclusive resort resembled. This is a 5 star resort, but not on the same scale as a Westin, Ritz Carlton or Loews (which I was thinking). The rooms were beautiful...similar to a Holiday Inn or Hampton....nothing too fancy but everything you need and clean. We didn't have a schedule but needed to be aware of the facilities time schedule for meals. We ate at the italian restaurant and had reservations at 2 other restaurants but never made it (we were in the mist of an activity and didn't want to hurry back to shower and change for dinner). Buffet - it was great. There's something for everyone. The food was not bland. Alot of the fish and meat were grilled. There was always fish (cooked and raw), red meat, pasta, pizza and reliable hotdog and hamburgers, diet and vegetarian food. I didn't care for the squid or octopus, and some of the fish was fishy. Loved the grouper with garlic. Shirmp was great one evening and another evening was overcooked. Doesn't mean it was bad, its preference. Thursday nights buffet includes all the lobster tails you can eat! And it was great!! At time the food was not as warm, but you figure out what you like and wait for them to put a hot plate out. Some of the food was fine warm. The bufffet is outside but very little bugs, didn't bother us. A few birds (crows) but they were something to look at and didn't bother anyone. The waiters kept the tables clean and service was great with them. Room - As other writers have noted, we had requested a king size bed, and got 2 doubles. We requested a king size bed and stayed in the doubles for 1 night and moved into a king. This didn't bother us, it may for some. There are no elevators. Hence, if you are on the 2nd or 3rd floor, you may want to request a 1st floor. We carried our own luggage up to our room. Landscape/Pool The landscape is beautiful. Its a tropical rain forest. Plenty of animals to see. If you look up high into the trees, the monkeys are there. We had no problem and practically saw them every night around 6-7pm. We didn't spend much time at the pool. The water is extremely warm compared to the ocean. The swim up bar is separate from the regular pool, so you have to get out of one and into another one. Drinks - the bartenders had no problem when you requested a little more alcohol. The miami vices are good at the outside restaurant where it's already made. I had a few bad ones (when they made it indiviudally), but when you got a good one, you drank it like a milk shake. Don't forget the icecream. It's available at poolside the small shack bar and the larger one outdoor restaurant. They don't give you alot, because it melts very quickly, but you can always get more. The drinks did melt quickly, we didn't have any problem--we drank quickly. There is no service at the beach, you'll have to get up and go to the bar for a drink. I don't recall any waiters walking around the poolside to see if you wanted a drink. Tips- not expected. We were concerned the first day we were there, and realized there were more people not tipping then there were tipping. We tipped a little, but it was too difficult to carry the money with you if you didn't have waterproof container. We spent alot of time in the ocean and we were not going to worry about tipping. We tipped housekeeping everyday. Bring money, if you plan on doing outside activitites. NOTE NO REFUNDS regardless of weather. Xel-Ha we did this in the rain. If you have your own snorkel equipment and towel and don't plan on eating and drinking \"unlimited\". I would recommend that you get the \"basic\" ($58) plan instead of all-inclusive ($83). Again, its your preference. We didn't eat there and bought a soda/water for a few dollars. We had a big breakfast which normally tied us over until dinner. If you don't like missing a meal, get the all in-clusive. The buffet is $18 per person so it does pay for itself. Scuba - We scuba dived with the group on site because of convenience and we needed a \"refresher\" course. I had not dove in 9 years, so I needed a refresher. I would not dive with them again... because we never had enough air and always came up with less than 60psi. (Not sure if the conversion was different. I dove in Cozumel years ago and looking back at my log I had 2000 to 3000 PSI) We left shore with 190 to 200 PSI?!?!Nor did they check back to see how much air until you were panicking to catch up with them to let them know you were half or in the red. I don't like to dive and watch my gauge for air. One woman we met, she ran out of air and had to grab her buddy's. I would definitely go again to Quetzal. However, I would like to know if there is a price difference betwen Tucan and Quetzal since they are one in the same. Check it out before you make your reservations. Cozumel - it doesn't matter what boat you take into cozumel, they depart at the same time and get there about the same time. We went on the \"yellow\" boat (was told it was the fastest), the other boat docked and people got off quicker than we did. Save a few bucks and haggle with the other boat. We had them down to $15 per person verses $18. Hope this helps you on your planning. If you have any specific questions, please feel free to email me.

The beach was beautiful, although drinks are very hard to get out there. There were not as many activities as they said there would be, but some performers, no interaction.

The brochure said NO SPRING BREAKERS, but about 30 minutes after we arrived, in came 2 bus fulls of them! Now if they were college kids, who have drank before, we could still deal with it. The bus was filled with 245 girls ages 17-18 for a high school senior break. Although at first my husband loved it (HAHA!), it quickly got annoying. They were loud and rude at the pools (starting at 11:00), dinner was also loud because they were all yelling at each other from across the room, and the night club that they had was full of the kids (mostly under age, even in Mexico - 17 is too young, 18 is legal). By the end of the second night 2 more buses and my husband is literally picking up bodies off the floor of passed out girls by 10:00 at night.

I only wish we could have stayed longer. We stayed the week of May 1-8 2004. I was apprehensive about staying in Mexico as I had no experience in foreign countries other than Canada. The airport was a little hectic. In the customs line some experienced people told us it would be and to just keep going and look for the Lomas travel people. The trip was a little longer than I thought it would be but once arriving at the Quetzal I was totally impressed at the beauty of the resort. Had trouble with the check in. I had requested a King size non smoking room. They gave us a King smoking. Went to check it out and could not stay there a week. Only one non smoking building and had to have 2 double beds for the week. The king would have been nice but this was ok because we spent very little time in our room. Because the room wasn't ready we went to the bar and had a shot of Don Julio tequilla and a beer. Best tequilla I have ever had. Anyway finally arrived in the room, changed and went to the beach. Beautiful walkways, pool and lush tropical vegetation on the way. I will never forget my first view of the beach and the beautiful blue water of the Carribean. It was better than I thought it could ever be. The beach restaurant had a big selection of food----Best guacamole I have ever had and very fresh. The buffet for dinner was also impressive. I thought the presentation and selection were great. They varied the theme nightly and tried to add different items so it did not get monotonous. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the buffet. There were people constantly cleaning so there was not spilled food and messiness around the food. The service most days was very good. We did tip the waiters if they took care of us as they can probably use it. I also left a $2 tip daily for the maid and came back to the room with a different surprise made of towels, fresh flowers and chocolates. Usually a swan but one day a heart. Was fun to see what it would be. One tip I read was to bring and insulated cup for drinks. We did and it worked out great. Kept the drink nice and cool and didn't have to go for refills often. We bought the 20 oz at Walmart for under $2. The drinks were great and varied. We had bloody marys, bahama mamas, margaritas, mudslides and all kinds of other delicious drinks. Enjoyed the pool bar every day on the way back to our room for dinner. The atmosphere was fun and the bartenders friendly. Ate at the Carribean and the steak house restaurants. The steak house had a great filet. We left one day to go to town. I did not like it there and didn't much feel like leaving the resort after. I was feeling a little ill that day, though. Bring pepto with you just in case. I had a strong case of overindulgence for 3 days or might have ate something that didn't agree with me.

There was a wide selection to cater for everyone. We also managed to get into all of the restuarants twice, we liked the mexican the best.

I don't know if Lomas or Alltournative was trying to get an extra $40.00 from us. I was greatful I had read that information before we left for our trip.

The shows at night might be a little tacky, but the entertainment is talented and they're always fun! The service is always excellent and VERY friendly, and the grounds are kept spotless and luxurious.

We arrived there on 3/20/04 and stayed until the 26th. The bus ride to the hotel was a blast even though we had a slow driver.. I believe his nickname was \"Old Cow.\" Our bus hostess answered a lot of questions and sold us plenty of Corona beer.. the last you will see once on the resort. Check in went really well and we went directly to our rooms to see what they had to offer.. and they were okay. We did like being on the lower level. Rooms were cleaned daily and we tipped our housekeeper $2 a day plus gave a small gift, like samples of lipstick, perfume etc. Although friends who traveled with us tipped $1 most days and left nothing else had similar kept rooms. The fridge did end up being stocked daily and we had fun towel friends on the bed. Last thing about the room, only had a lizard in there once, and he was pretty small. The resort was very nice and clean. I did not feel the beach was dirty at all. But to get a good seat at the beach or pool you needed to put your towel on a chair by 6:15 a.m. And thank goodness my husband did for our entire group.. he usually saved 8 chairs. The weather was great for our entire trip. It was windy most days, but it would have been really hot without it. FOOD.. enjoyed most of it. The restaurants were average, but it was nice to sit and be served rather than doing the buffet. We thought the best restaurant was the steak house. The chicken was great. We didn't do alot of excursions as we were there to relax. We did snorkel one time $50 per person, with 3 stops. That was fun, but the water was pretty rough that day. KIDS at the resort didn't seem to be a problem. I just kept thinking I am glad mine are with grandma. ENTERTAINMENT was okay.. I hear the Las Vegas night on Fridays was really fun. They do have some pretty good singers and dancers working there though. I believe they were the star friends and they were there all day and evening to be your buddy and get you involved. BEVERAGES were good. Didn't seem to matter if you tipped the Bartender as you could ask for the better alcohol if you wanted it and if they had it. There was hardly ever a wait for a drink at the bar. At the pool when ordering from your chair it does take a bit longer. And the POOL BAR... I think they use less watered down alc there..or you just get them faster. JUNGLE.. was neat the monkeys screamed a bit a few mornings and yes we saw them our last morning. There are plenty of animals to see. One thing if you going from point A to point B, going through the jungle seemed kind of long. Anyway overall we had a great time. Would do it again.

I have stayed elsewhere and had better luck with the buffet-style food. If you are a hot dog fan ? try one at the Iberostar, they are surprisingly good. They did have well known brands of liquor, so that made up for the lack-luster meals.There are Howler Monkeys living at this resort. We apparently got a very good room (resort edge side bldg 26, 3rd floor) if you are interested in the monkeys because they used our roof as a path to the inner part of the resort. We got several pictures of them REALLY close to our balcony.This hotel is definitely nicer than the Occidental Allegro or Riu next door and we never had any trouble finding a place to sit on the beach (pool is another story). The beach is gorgeous at this hotel. There is a wait staff that will bring drinks to you on the beach - thought that was great. Tipping is greatly appreciated.I wasn?t a fan of their nightly shows. Many of the skits were bizarre and/or irritating. I did enjoy the ever-present hotel theme song and dance. Mascara (the night club) was a tad odd (they had the staff dress up in Halloween costumes), but played popular music and was open until 3am for the teenagers and night owls. Good that it is away from guest rooms because it is loud.The kids at this resort seemed really happy and the star friends seemed to keep them pretty busy throughout the day. I don?t think it is a great place for toddlers as there are quite a few accident-waiting-to-happen areas for someone so small ? especially around the pool and in the jungle. But I didn?t have any kids with me, so take that for what it?s worth. There is soft serve ice cream by the pool - a real crowd pleaser - kids were eating 4 or 5 cones a day!We didn't hang out in the pools too much during the day, besides the lack of available loungers (people do that ?saving chairs for later? thing here), the only ladies room that I could find near the pool only had 4 stalls and often had quite a pile up of women waiting. They kept it clean ? but I hope you don?t mind guys with mops in the bathroom while you are using it - happened more than once.One thing about this resort - when the sun started to go down, the pool and beach became deserted. I mean ghost town. This was a great time to go to the pool or beach and have it basically to yourself. Keep your beach towel close - they want $10 to replace it.If you have a late flight on your departure date, for $10 per hour, you can keep your room after the regular check out time of noon (based on availability). They also have a nice hospitality room that you can use after check out and will let you keep your towel cards and all-inclusive bracelets until you depart.I would stay at the Iberostar again, but I go to Playa 2 times a year and will probably check out another place next time.

There were a lot of families and couples in their 40's and 50's, etc. Some \"spring breakers\" arrived shortly after we did, but I think Cancun probably had a lot more. We seemed to be caught in the middle as far as age is concerned, but we didn't mind! I would suggest breaking in your sandals before going if you're not used to wearing them, I developed some blisters. I brushed my arm up against the extremely hot metal grill at the buffet by the pool and burned my arm. (It was my own fault and should have been more careful, but be cautious!) We took the ferry to Cozumel for the Jeep tour. My boyfriend vomitted on the way to Cozumel and I came very close to doing the same (we sat inside the ferry towards the front) We were okay for the trip back to Playa del Carmen b/c we bought Dramamine at a pharmacia, and sat outside in the very back part of the ferry. Get there early so you can get a good seat! I thought parts of the Jeep tour were okay. The snorkeling was fun, and we stopped at a beach to do some swimming and eat lunch. My boyfriend liked it a lot (once he recovered) but you do go on very rough, unpaved roads, so if you are older or have back problems, you should not do this. The rough driving was not for me!! I wore my hair parted down the middle and I burned my scalp. Wear a hat! The hotel itself was very nice and clean. The hotel and Funjet staff were very nice. Just about everyone spoke English! The animals were amazing. There were lots of monkeys, lizards and flamingos which were fun to watch. There are always buffets or restaurants open so you can eat any time of the day that you want to. The nightly shows were lots of fun. The host is amazing, because he speaks in so many different languages. (There were a lot of guests from Europe) We never made it to the discoteca, because we were always exhausted after our adventures during the day, or even from laying on the beach or by the pool. The pool was wonderful, very big and the temperature was perfect. The weather was in the 80's and 90's during our stay and always sunny! Coming home to Chicago (30 degrees) has been rough!!

In addition to that review let me just say that I have traveled quite a bit and stayed at very nice resorts, but the IBQ beat them all by far for the beauty, friendliness and value. I even loved the hard beds. We had big plans to go to Cozumel, Tulum, etc, but instead gave into the waves of inertia that swept over us the minute we arrived. Just walking from the beach chairs to the grill took a full blown effort on everyone's part. The jungle atmosphere has to be seen to be appreciated, especially at night. The fellow travelers that were there seemed like great people, and made for great people watching during the day. Children seemed to be catered to with many programs and activities and were all having a ball. As crowded as it was, it is a very quiet resort.

Last year we stayed at the Aventura Spa Palace, which is adults only, and we liked the Quetzal better even though none of us brought kids. Having kids at the resort was not a problem for anyone in our group and there were eight of us, all in our 50's. The food is better at the Quetzal than at the Spa Palace and the grounds are much more tropical. This is a jungle type environment which we just loved. You cannot see the beach from most of the rooms, but we didn't mind that at all. Speaking of the beach, there is plenty of shade avalable under the many palapa's scattered about, and the beach was beautiful. If you're looking for someplace to go to sit on the beach or by the pool, have a few drinks and relax, then without a doubt I would go here. If you're looking for an active nightlife, there isn't much at the hotel, but you can go into Playa Del Carmen at night (5 minutes away and very safe) which is a $4.00 taxi ride. For those people that have left comments about the lack of gourmet food, then they don't travel much. You don't go to Mexico for gourment food.

Many of the positive comments on this board are right on target so I won't re-hash everything and hopefully some of you will find this useful. NO. 1 - The Quetzal and the Tucan are the same hotel. Just different lobbies and (I found out by asking) they deal with different travel agencies. There is no difference in the rooms or facilities and no matter which side you stay, you get full run of the hotel. But there may be a difference in the price you pay! Shop for the best deal at either because you get the same hotel. NO. 2 - Yes there is a great deal of smoking but I - as an ex-smoker - can honestly say it did not bother us at all. As most of the hotel is open to the outside the ventilation is great. NO. 3 - The food ranges from good to very good and is plentiful. The beach bar area is awesome for lunch, the buffet is good with well-prepared food for all meals and has something for everyone. We ate at the Mexican restaurant and the Tropical restaurant, both were very good with quick service and specialty items not available elsewhere in the hotel. We were only there for four days and I expect you might need some variety if you are there longer than a week. You should have no trouble getting reservations as long as you are flexible about times. NO. 4 - the staff is incredibly friendly, professional and efficient. I recommend you tip them well.

The beach was beautiful and went on for a long way. Everything was included except for the diving. You could have what ever you wanted to drink. There was a mini-fridge in the room that was stocked with beer, soda, & water. There was a big swim up bar that was very popular. In the afternoon, you could hear people sitting around the swim up bar singing. It was funny. The diving was very good. We saw several turtles on one dive. A few moray eels and lots of fish. We also went diving in the Cenotes. These are underground caverns and caves. I really liked this it was different from any other diving that we have done. The water was so clear it seemed as if you weren't even in water. There were staligmites and staligtites. It was beautiful. The food was good, not quite as good as Celebrity cruises. There are 4 specialty restaurants on the property that you can make reservations. We ate in three of the restaurants. They guarantee that you can eat in 2 of the restaurants if you stay a week. The rest of the time you eat at the buffet. The food is good. but the buffets can get a little boring. I like a sit down dinner at night. The donut lady at breakfast is one of my favorites. She fries up fresh made cream filled donuts. Yum ! The beef is also excellent. They also served shrimp. Cons: All of the furniture in the room is concrete including the art work that is on the wall. The bed is concrete with a very dense foam mattress. The beds are too hard !!

Many of the reasons it was sucessful was the tips that I received from this board and others. I am posting this report in a couple of places so that people who frequent a particular board will hopefully benefit from it.My husband and 10 year old son and 7 year old daughter stayed there Jan 14 21st. It was just a fantastic week both at the hotel and on our excursions. We booked through Funjet, so we stayed on the Quetzal side. Everything went smoothly start to finish and it was a vacation to remember.We booked most of our excursions over the Internet in advance. We saved a fortune and it really worked out fine. We book Xel Ha directly through their internet site and we also booked an Alltournative Tour to Coba/Pac Chen through their site. My husband is a certified diver, so he communicated via e-mail to a number of dive shops including Dressel Divers at the resort. All of the dive shops were prompt with e-mails and really easy to deal with. My husband ended up booking his diving through Tank Ha dive shop in Playa Del Carmen. He chose that dive shop for 2 reasons. First was price, they were very reasonable, and the other reason was that he really wanted to do a Cozumel dive, but did not want it to be an all day event and abandon me and the kids. Tank Ha has a 2-tank \u00bd day Cozumel Dive so that sealed the deal. So he booked a \u00bd day Cozumel dive and a \u00bd Cenote dive, which he just loved.So the day before we left we sat the kids down for a family meeting to discuss how the travel day would go and what days we had things planned and what were free days. This method works well for my family; otherwise the kids are asking to go swimming the minute our plan arrives in Cancun.Travel was smooth with no delays, long lines, or anything unexpected. Even though we were completely warned by other posters on the boards and by Funjet, those timeshare people in the airport still almost caught us. They were really good. We got to the resort and received the building that we requested via e-mail so we were really excited. Especially since we watched others spend a lot of effort trying to get a better room. Our room was ready so we dumped our stuff, had a quick lunch, then off to the pool and beach.Resort Appearance: I just can t put into words how beautiful the resort is. The landscaping is meticulous and people seem to work all day keeping it that way. It is just breathtaking. The lobby was just beautiful and the kids couldn t get over how fancy it was. We loved the jungle and all of the animals. Everything was well maintained and the attention to detail was great. People commented on garbage on the beach and around the pool and we didn t think that there was any problem. People should try to keep things in perspective though. There were about 800 guests at the resort, and most of those guests left their glasses, straws, napkins, plates, and what ever else wherever they dropped it. I saw probably 4 6 people constantly cleaning the beach and pool area all day, but even 4 6 people cannot keep up with the litter of hundreds. On windy days straws and napkins blow all over. So if you are going to be picky about litter, then pick up yours. Otherwise understanding and patience it recommended. These people really work hard at trying to keep things clean.Room: It was beautiful. As recommended we tipped about $2.00 per day. We were rewarded with great towel art every day. They even went a step beyond that and incorporated the kid s stuffed animals into the towel art. One of the highlights each day was going back to the room after cleaning to see what was left for us. It was really cute. We usually headed out for the day about 9:30, so we just put out the room available sign and we had it cleaned by lunch each day. No problems with water or stocking of the fridge. Water pressure and we had hot water every day.Food/Dining: We at breakfast and dinner in the main dining buffet and it were fine. Our biggest disappointment was that we did not get lobster on the seafood night. That was a big let down since we all are lobster fans. The kids loved the buffet for all of their meals. Breakfast was huge since that is our favorite meal of the day. The kids loved all of the choices and we never tired of it. We ate healthy some mornings and the full out grease meal some mornings. There was a few mornings that had freshly made doughnuts and other fried pastries that were great. Lunch was eaten at the beachside grills. The kids loved the pizza and French fries and the nachos became our favorite afternoon snack. The burgers were great. We saved our sit down dinners for our last 2 nights. We did the Steak house and Mexican. The steaks were great, but I think that it was because we were hungry and did not have steak for a few nights. Yes the rib eyes were thin and slightly overcooked, but they tasted great and it was a nice meal. Same with the Mexican. We loved the steak and cheese tacos, but I think we could have made an entire meal off of the appetizers. My son s big disappointment came with the fact he couldn t get a burrito all week. On one night at the buffet a magician/balloon artist came around and the kids loved that. Another night was a mariachi band. Drinks were great and the kids loved the virgin versions and ice cream multiple times a day.Entertainment: The kid s mini-disco is held each night at 8:15 in the main theater and is done by the same people that run the kids club. It was fun to go to that. They played 1 game that resulted in 1 winner or a team winning, then the Iberostar dance is done. My daughter loves the dance, so if anyone has the moves let me know. We only stayed for the evening dancing 3 nights and it was nice. The rest of the time we crashed we were so tired.Kids Club: Starts at 10:15ish. In Mexican time that is probably 10:25am. They give you a schedule when you arrive at the resort, but they did not stick to it completely. My kids however still enjoyed it. The days that we were going to be at the resort all day I basically sat down with the kids and found out if there were any activities that they wanted to do that day and then they joined when they felt like it. There were a few times when there was something scheduled and they ended up doing something else. I told the kids the club had to be flexible depending on staff and kids. One of the staff was on vacation, so there was only 1 girl there. So I am sure that impacted what was done. Overall my kids enjoyed the kids club and participated in something most days. They made a lot of friends and they hung out together either in the club or on the beach. One nice thing was the Maricruz (the kids club staff) let us use some of the swim toys in the pool and on the beach and that was nice of her. My kids also loved the pottery. We let them each do a piece. What was nice was that after they were done, someone on staff cleaned up the lines for them and it looks great.Pool/Beach: Pool was cold in morning, but that never stopped us. We still swam all day and the ocean was great. We had 1 red flag day and since I brought our life jackets we buckled up the kids and took them in the waves, which they loved. Now it was dangerous with the tow so we made them stay in their life jackets and kept them close to shore and with us. The rest of the week it was like a bathtub. My husband wished the hot tub was hot, but he survived.Excursions: We went to Xel Ha one day and did the Alltournative Coba/Pac Chen tour another day. Both were excellent and we loved them. The Coba/Pac Chen tour was amazing and a great day. Xel Has was fun and great way to spend the day. We book Xel Ha over the Internet then rented a car from the resort for $55.00 for the day. That really worked out fine and we save a fortune over the resort tour. We went into Playa one afternoon. We found a place that did \u00bd head of cornrows for my daughter and a tattoo for my son for $10 each. They loved that. Then we went through all of the stores for souvenirs.Topless/Smoking: Yes there were both. We warned the kids that they would see topless women and that it wasn t a big deal, that is just how some women like to sunbathe, especially European women. For these people it is normal and natural. It is not what we do, but that it is OK for them. The expression on my 10 year olds face when he saw his first topless person was priceless. It wasn t like everyone was nude. As far as smoking, it was there, but not bothersome. We always sat in non-smoking and never saw anyone smoking in that section and we were not bothered elsewhere.I am sorry this is so long. I am trying to mention things that will help others. We learned so much on this vacation and had such a good time it is hard to stop. Someone posted something right before we left that pretty much stated that part of vacation was being flexible and easy going and then you will have fun and that was our motto all week. Is this place perfect, no, but there was nothing catastrophic that would ruin a vacation. We had wonderful and would go back again.

There were 20 of us in our family that travelled together and I have to say that our accomodations were great. I had requested ahead of time that we be assigned to the same bungalow and as close to the pool and beach as possible and my request was fulfilled. We stayed in building #22 which was a perfect location for us - we are big time beachers so being close to the lobby was not a priority. The reviews on Quetzal our mixed and mine are as well. The positives of the resort include the service, accomodations, activities for the kids, the Star Friends and all other staff members. The negatives include the beach - although it's a beautiful beach, it is not maintained well - it is littered with cigarette butts and there are vendors that walk up and down the beach all day trying to sell their goods. Depending on the trade winds, the fumes from the motor boats and jet skiis can become quite strong when you're on the beach. The ocean water, however, was warm and very refreshing. Pool water was colder than the ocean. Alcohol choices are limited - no top shelf alcohol available and the wine is low quality as well. The food in the buffet and the specialty restaurants is average and repetitive. My family has stayed at the Iberostar Bavaro in the Dominican Republic and we were expecting the Quetzal to be along the same quality which was a bit disappointing. Despite the negatives, we had an awesome vacation. We had a blast on New Year's Eve - plenty to do that night for young and old alike. Lots of day excursions to pick from - Tulum was awesome; an absolutely breathtaking view and it's worth going with a guide to hear the history of the Mayans and their culture. Xel-Ha was a beautiful place but horribly crowded. We were there in the early afternoon and had to wait hours to get snorkel equipment - they had no masks to give us. Bring your own equipment and save yourself the hassel - snorkeling in the caves in and the park itself was wonderful but don't expect to see a lot of tropical fish - we did see a school of yellow fin tuna that was it. There was also jet skiis, ATV riding with snorkeling in cenotes, horseback riding in Cancun on the beach and parasailing to fill our days. 5th Avenue is a stop you have to make but make sure you go to the mall - it's easy to loose your way and end up on the side streets where the quality of merchandise is less and the prices seem to be a bit higher. Suggestions if you're going to Playa del Carmen - go to the ruins - Tulum is only 40 minutes away and worth the trip. 5th Avenue is great for shopping and picking up those souvenirs you'll be searching for, get comfortable with your vacation representative and the staff at the reception desk - they are full of relative information. Xel-Ha and Xcaret are filled with activities but expect to spend a full day at either one in order to make it worth your money and time. Relax and enjoy yourself! All in all, we had a wonderful vacation and are already making plans for next year. We won't return to Quetzal because there are far too many other places to visit in the world.", "Date": "January 7, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, MN", "Title": "\u201cGreat family vacation\u201d", "Author": "ALG48", "ReviewID": "UR1531871", "Content": "Just returned from a week at the Quetzal, December 20-27. We are an \"older\" family with 3 young adult offspring -- all of whom loved the beach, the sun, and the atmosphere. The setting is quite spectacular, and they have integrated the natural jungle into the landscape of the hotel --- including all the wildlife. Saw monkeys, peacocks, and many other species. Gorgeous pool, and magnificent beach. We were always able to get beach chairs, but the place wasn't entirely full. On the day we left it seemed to be getting much more crowded, and it was harder to find a spot -- especially at the pool. Enjoyed the free sailing on catamarans and kayaks. Some of us also went snorkeling. Had one visit to the Mayan ruins in Tulum, but other than that we pretty much stayed at the resort -- aside from some strolls into the nearby town of Playa del Carmen , about 3 km away. The most positive attributes are the following: 1 - the staff are friendly, available, helpful, and always smiling. This included everyone from bartenders, to waiters, to maids, to front desk staff. Any request was dealt with promptly and effectively. 2. The place is kept immaculately clean. The grounds are continuously being cleaned, floors scrubbed, etc. 3. It's very nice not to have to carry a wallet around, and still be able to get a drink on the beach, an ice cream, a snack, etc. 4. The facilities and beach were lovely. The water in the ocean was actually warmer than the water in the pool, however. A lot of people were complaining that the pool was too cold. The rooms were very nice, although it would be nicer to have a clock radio. Beds are indeed very hard (as we were warned), but we didn't mind. Minibars are kept stocked with bottled water. On the negative side, my biggest complaint was the food. While there was lots of variety at the buffet restaurant, I found the quality to range from poor to mediocre (but I am personally very fussy about food quality and restaurants). Even the specialty restaurants were mediocre, in my opinion. I think this is one of the inherent hazards of \"all-inclusive\" resorts, where you have prepaid all of your food and they are feeding the masses. The shows in the evening were pretty amateur, but this was not a big deal for me as I had low expectations and even less interest. I was happy to return to my room and read a book. The rooms are quite nice, each with a balcony. There is no dresser, just a few shelves in the closet, so it would have been nicer to have a little more storage space. Also, there were very tiny ants on the counter top all the time --so we ended up unpacking our bags at home in the laundry room and washing absolutely everything. Also, the towels in the bathrooms are all fairly thin and could use replacing. The best advice I received (from this website) before leaving was to bring about fifty $1 bills to use for tips. While tipping isn't required, it's probably a good idea to leave 1 or 2 dollars for the maid each day, and to look after waiters or bartenders if they have been particularly attentive. These tips are much appreciated. My complaints are minor in the context of the overall vacation, which we found very relaxing. It was our intention to have a \"do-nothing\" vacation during which we could finish a few good books, get lots of sun, enjoy being together as a family, and not have to worry about what to do and where to eat. In that sense, our goals were met and we liked it a lot.", "Date": "December 28, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Claremont, NH", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely perfect!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1531101", "Content": "My sister and I spent a week last year at this resort.

We had a marvellous time and find it hard to pick at anything to fault. Well, maybe the level of noise coming from the entertainment lounge in the evening which carried on until quite late Our room was in building 22, which is the 3rd building nearest to the beach and so was one of the ones furthest away from the evening entertainment, but the noise was as clear and loud as if it were just coming from directly outside our room! Anyway, not a real complaint, it's just us being old! Should really be more active and enjoy all that's going on when on vacation! After the initial relaxing week we decided to venture out further than downtown Playa Del Carmen and the Playacar Plaza, so we did 2 excursions: a shopping tour in Cancun and a tour of Chichen Itza. Honestly, we could have done without the shopping trip but Chichen Itza was brilliant! Definitely not to be missed! We also crossed over to Cozumel which is a lot more touristy and upmarket than PDC. Just looking at all the big air conditioned, brightly lit jewelers along the seafront! Not what we expected to see in Mexico at all! One shop we would recommend is right at the end of the seafront (from the ferry port you turn left), I think it's called Los Cinco Soles, or something like that. They've got all the gifts you would need to buy, at very good prices and of much better quality as well! Back to the topic of the hotel! Indeed, the staff is so friendly and helpful it's unbelievable! The food was great and we even had the chefs teach us how to cook some of the dishes! Husband absolutely loves seafood, especially lobsters, so this was definitely the right place for him cos they served lobsters at most meals. It could be in the soup, in salads, grilled in abundance etc. Husband was in heaven!! Lobster night is on Thursdays. On the Thursdays when they don't serve lobsters, they serve giantic king prawns!! We're both very picky eaters and found the quality of the food exceptionally high, but near the end of the second week things became a bit 'samey' We recommend the steak restaurant and their rib eye steak is the best we've ever tasted!! The chocolate ice-cream served at the beach bar was to die for!! We were there at the end of the stormy season, it rained extremely heavily for 3 days and the red flag was up on the beach for quite a few days. And there really are monkeys there! Just follow the howling and watch out for people looking up at trees! All in all it was great and we really couldn't imagine there being a better resort to stay at for our honeymoon. Recommendation: Tropical Coconut has to be the best drink at Iberostar Q.

At one point they \"lost\" some kids in the pool, franticly looking for them before the parents show up again. No responsibility at all. Only busy with themselves, their looks, flirting to their fellow male staff members. We noticed that Iberostar is apparantly focusing only on their new properties at the Paraiso Beach. They transfered all their \"good\" people to the new places. In the room the bar gets refilled only every third day. Forget the times the hotel provided also a conditioner for your hair, or a body lotion. A lot of times we had to call because our room was not made at all. At the restaurants the food is also not as good as it used to be. As is the service. The highcairs for the babies are filthier than ever. And don't think you can eat at all their restaurants. Per week you are only entitled to dine twice at their nice restaurants. Otherwise it's buffet only. They used to have a very nice, quiet pool for adults only with a waterfall.

So I will attempt to return the favor here and offer the pros and cons, as I see them, since we returned from our ten-day visit to the Iberostar Quetzal last week (Nov. 1st). Overall, we were very well pleased with the resort and the service, which was second-to-none. It was awesome. We found the waiters to be so pleasant and tipped them every chance we got, even though we didn't have to, since it's all-inclusive. I recommend taking about 50 $1 dollar bills with you so you can tip for good service by the waiters, bellboys, housekeeping. They make next to nothing in wages and very much appreciate your sharing your blessings. In fact, I tipped our chambermaid $1 every day, and left a little toiletry item for her that they don't have there, which we take for granted here in the States. And I believe she went the extra mile taking care of our room because of it--special towel designs on the bed every day, extra candies on the pillows, spotlessly clean bathroom, floor swept daily, mini-fridge bulging with beer, water, sodas. The front desk people were so-so. Not very caring, really. When we reported that we mistakenly left a piece of luggage in Mexican customs at the airport, they just kind of shrugged and directed us to the Funjet counter, whom we had booked our flight with. Since we had no luggage, we also had no toothbrush or toiletries of our own, and asked at the front desk if they could give us complimentary things like a toothbrush and razor, but again they just looked at me like I was crazy and said they don't have that sort of thing. What?! I found this to be absolutely astounding because in the States, even the dumpiest motel has complimentary toiletries like that when a guest forgets to bring them. So, because we needed contact lens stuff too and the hotel store didn't have that, we walked to nearby Playacar's shopping district and paid $22 (US$) for the stuff we needed, which was a little dismaying. About the beach--the color of the ocean still amazes me when I think of it....truly turquoise, and the beach was beautifully white (but with no seashells at all!), but unfortunately absolutely MOBBED with people. I'm not kidding. There were so many people, I thought I was visiting Disney World in high season. That was really rottten because we had no way to escape, unless we wanted to walk two beaches over where all the trash is collected on the dunes. Unbelievable. Finally, we found some peace and quiet at the edges of the resort property where there were still plenty of people, but mostly quieter older folks who were just sleeping on lounges, and thankfully keeping their swimsuit tops on. Which brings me to another topic--if you don't want a topless beach, let me tell you--stay HOME. There were breasts staring at us everywhere. I just found that very disturbing since there were kids running around everywhere, and for some of us, we don't want to be sitting next to a perfect body with our husbands right there, so I wish I'd have known that in advance--I would have booked into a more family-oriented resort. In fact, it really ruined it for me. Anyway, the FunJet people were absolutely WONDERFUL. They booked all excursions for us, and took care of our luggage dilemma. We would definitely book FunJet again. Thank God for them. If we'd have been on our own dealing with Mexican customs, I doubt we could have recovered our luggage. They just wanted us to have a wonderful vacation and tried to do their best. About the excursions, don't bother with the excursion to see the Tulum ruins. After making 4 stops at other resorts along the way, what should have been a 30-minute ride took two hours. We made 6 stops on the way back, and all the time I'm wondering why they called it the \"Tulum Express.\" Probably because once our tour guide stopped talking to our group, which stood baking in the blazing hot sun with about a million people wandering around, we had only 45 minutes to wander the place by ourselves before we had to be back on the bus! A waste of money. I would definitely NOT do that again. Our friends spent the day at the Chichen-Itza ruin and said they enjoyed that excursion very much. It was a longer day, yes, and more expensive, but they had about 3 hours to explore those ruins, unlike our 45 minutes. On another day, we did the parasailing thing, using the hotel's services on the beach, which was a blast, but we spent $90 for the two of us to go, and should have had 12 minutes airtime, but ended up with only 9. Hey, when you're spending that kind of dough, you want those extra three minutes, right? We also did the snorkeling excursion on Paradise Reef, which was amazing. That was pretty good too, although the last hour of the excursion was spent waiting for the van in a little cafe off the beach where they gave you one round of free beer and chips, hoping you'll buy more in the time remaining. We would rather have spent that hour snorkeling longer. I guess it was just our preference. Maybe others might have enjoyed lounging in the cafe eating and drinking beer. About the hotel pool area--that was really nice. THe staff is constantly walking around with trays, offering you Bahama Mamas, Pina Coladas, beer, soft drinks.....very nice service. You'd think with all that booze, some guests might have gotten rowdy, but we didn't see any of that. It was spotless too, with lounge chairs surrounding the entire pool. We didn't use the swim-up bar because it is isolated from the main pool, sets in a shaded area, and the water was ice cold. It was beautiful though, with a waterfall, so if you don't mind the ice cold water, go for it. There was no topless around the pool area, so that was another plus. The hotel food and restaurants were slightly above average, but I must say, the buffet and presentation were astounding. So what if the food was just ordinary--the displays were amazing and the variety wonderful. So, in summary, all in all, I would recommend the Iberostar. The staff and service were stellar, absolutely excellent. Food not bad. Housekeeping, magnificent. Grounds, jungle, animals--splendid! One downside, the topless stuff and uncaring front-desk people.

I am a travel agent and this was our third visit to Mexico (my favorite!) The last time we were in Playacar we stayed at the Riu Palace. The Palace is a beautiful resort but it could be anywhere. The Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan feels like Mexico. The jungle area was wonderful but the walkways got hard to walk on after a week! They were very bumpy and rock-like. We saw Peacocks, a Toucan, Parrots, Flamingos, Phesants, and two large monkeys! The food was ok the beginning of the week but was wonderful the end of the week on tropical/seafood night (lobster-yumm), beach party day and the steakhouse. The Italian restaurant (La Gondola) was not good. My husbands pork chops could not even be cut and my red snapper had tons of bones in it. They also have no non-smoking sections in the indoor restaurants so smoke is all over-gross! Speaking of smoking, the beach looks like one big ash tray:( I am in love with the beaches in the Mayan Riviera and they have always been so spotless/clean. Well, I wanted to cry. People were putting their cigs out all over the beautiful white sand. If you are a smoker I urge you to have some class and get a plastic cup, put a bit of water in it, put your cigarettes out in that then take it up to the trash when you leave the beach. PLEASE! The jet skis also stink up the beach. I agree with a previous poster-do away with them. Turks and Caicos has stayed beautiful because they allow NO jet skis or water skiing. We never saw jet skis on the Playacar beaches before. The beach to the right of the Gala is deserted and beautiful, but all the trash from up the coast has washed up and is piled there. What is happening Mexico?! Please hire someone to clean this area. Once a week for 1/2 an hour is all it will take. The water is still beautiful and warm. The staff is great and there are many activities going on at the Quetzal. The pool is wonderful and very large. We went to the Iberostar Paraisio for a day and this resort is stunning. The beach is much better than in the pictures. This beach is also spotless-no straws and cigarettes in the sand. (Why a coke or water needs a straw I have no idea. Maybe a frozen drink, but for the sake of the sea life and natural setting they should do away with the straws they just wind up all over the ground.)

I was there from Sept 18-25th. I had never been there before but I had been to Cancun three times. I chose the Iberostar Quetzal based on the reviews I read on this website. Please forgive me if I jump from topic to topic, I do that. The hotel is very nice. I stayed in a basic room with a king sized bed and was pleased. The only thing about the room I would have changed was that there were these little tiny ants on the dresser and on the mirror. I had to be careful about laying stuff up there because the ants would end up on it. My boyfriend said he didn't think the ants were a big deal. The beach.... was beautiful. Basically I had told my boyfriend when this trip idea came up that I wanted to go to where they film the Corona Beer commercials. That beach is my idea of paradise and that is what I had my heart set on. Unfortunately we could not find out where the commercials are filmed but after seeing pictures and reading comments I felt pretty confident that this would be close. It was. The only thing is that I remember the sand in Cancun not ever getting hot. My boyfriend says I'm crazy. But I swear that was one of the things I loved about Cancun was the sand. In Playa the sand gets hot. We also found 3 pieces of glass on the ocean floor which surprised me a little. The breasts... I don't consider myself to be stuffy or a prude but I did not like the fact that everytime I turned my head on the beach there was a set of breasts in my face. On our second day there my boyfriend actually said that he had seen more breasts in 24 hours then he had seen in his whole life. It just seems odd to me to be walking down the beach with my friend and both of us our topless. The speedos, not a good look and they too are everywhere. The hotel was a lot more crowded then I expected. And there were way more kids then I cared for. The beach felt like Girls Gone Wild at Disneyworld. Since I was there a week, I did notice that around Monday-Wednesday it was a lot less crowded than it had been the weekend before. We ate all our meals but one at the hotel. We actually only left the hotel twice. Once to meet our bus to go snorkeling and once to go buy some souveniors at the market about 2 blocks away, the same place where our bus pickes us up for snorkeling. It wasn't like Cancun where you go down the street and there is Outback, TGI Fridays and Subway. There was nothing but other hotels. I strongly recommend making a reservation at the Steakhouse in the hotel. It was really good. We also ate at the Italian restaurant, I wasn't that impressed but it was still pretty good. We ordered room service one night when my boyfriend wasn't feeling well and the other nights we ate at the buffett dinner. I really liked the roastbeef but only found it twice. My new favorite drink is a Miami Vice, half Pina Colada half Strawberry Daquiri, yum. I got introduced to this at the Steakhouse when my waiter just brought me one on his own. The swim up bar is nice but could get crowded. The water was a little colder in here than the big swimming pool so it was nice when it was really hot out. It also has a really cool waterfall that everyone took pictures at. The bees....there were a ton of bees all around the bars outside. I seemed to be the only person the bees were coming after at the palapas on the beach. Sometimes I didn't even have a drink and they would swarm around me. That was not fun. I would be laying with my eyes closed and I could hear them buzzing by my head. The icecream is located at the outside bars...just walk up and tell the bartenders what flavor you want, vanilla, chocolate or both and they hand you an ice cream cone. We kayaked twice (it was included in the price). I recommend either kayaking or walking to the deserted beach that is to the left of the hotel if you are looking at the ocean. It's not very far. Next door to the Quetzal is another hotel then the deserted beach. We didn't go until our last day on the beach and I didn't take my camera but I really wish I had for some beautiful postcard type pictures of a deserted beach. We went parasailing $50 bucks a person or $90 for two. Parasailing was amazing, and I have a fear of heights but I regret waiting so long to do it. It wasn't scary at all. We rented a waverunner both guys charged $50 for 30 minutes. When I asked one if I could pay $25 and get 15 minutes he said no but he would give me 40 minutes for $50 and I could break it up in 2 20 minute sessions. This guy was the guy on the right if you were looking at the ocean. I asked the guy on the left for the same deal and he refused. One day all these merchants came and set up by the pool. That was really nice because it meant you didn't have to leave to go shop you could do it in your swimsuit. The only excursion we did was a trip to Xel-ha. It was a lot of fun and really pretty. That was like $150 for two and included transportaion, admission, snorkel gear, locker, towels and food/drinks. We were there like 6 hours so we had a lot of snorkel time. Back to the hotel, the monkeys...it took 4 days for me to see a monkey. I thought the hotel was lying about having them because I would see the don't feed the monkeys sign but never saw any. They are up in the trees by buildings 24 and 23 located by the fence that divides the property with the hotel next door. They have monkeys and they sound like gorillas but they are small. They also have a white peacock, I had never seen one before. Anything I would do differently, yeah.... I would have taken 2 water cameras with me instead of just 1. I paid less than $9 here for a water camera, there I paid $18 for 1. I would have taken Imodioum instead of having to wait for the gift shop to open to get it. I would have taken less clothes. Aside from the day I left I was in my swimsuit (I took 4) everyday all day long. I'd go back to the room shower and dress for dinner and come back and put on my pjs. I had kept reading about taking my own biodegradable sunblock since they don't allow you to wear any other kind when you snorkel at these places. I couldn't find any biodegradable sunblock at the store so I spent $8 at Xel-ha for a 2oz bottle of sunblock that I could wear in their water. I don't know if it's cheaper this way but here is the number to order it by mail 800-432-6723. The only negative thing I felt about the hotel was on the morning that my boyfriend woke up with montazuma's revenge he said he felt he needed a little food and asked me to go get him a piece of bread from the restaurant since roomservice didn't start til 11am and it was 9. I went down there and when I was asked how many for breakfast I told the girl I was just there to grab some food and take it to my room I guess I had gone beyond what she understood because a man walked up and told me no I could not do that. So the only way my boyfriend could get food was to leave the room that had the toliet he so needed or to wait til 11. My boyfriend had never been to an all-inclusive resort before after our trip I asked him what he thought. He told me he had thought it was going to be a hassel having to prove we had paid for the all inclusive deal, it wasn't they put a wristband on you and that's it. We booked through Funjet and he was amazed at how we were walked through every step and how organized everything was. My week at Iberostar Quetzal was amazing overall. We took 9 rolls of pictures and I bought all the pictures that the photographers at the hotel, parasailing and Xel-ha took of us. My thing is with just the two of us it's hard to get pictures with both of us in them. I asked quite a few people to take our picture and everyone happily agreed but I chickend out on a lot too and won't have those pictures of us together so my advice is just ask when you want your picture taken because you know that if someone asked you you would do it for them and not be bothered by the request. So I have to say that I recommend staying at this hotel and I hope I have helped someone with my long winded report of my trip to Playa.", "Date": "September 29, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201c\"Star\" staff an added bonus!!!

Regarding my comment on the beach, the water was beautiful and I was told that it was better in comparison to the Paraiso because it has no rocks. However, there is a sharp incline from the point where the waves crash onto the beach, so not a lot of area for the kids to run into the water or for people to walk or run on a flat surface. If we return, I will ask about the Kids daytime activites upon arrival. One night the kids get to be part of a show but they have to go to the camp in the morning to practice. I would not recommend taking children under the age of 4. Also, bring beach toys and life jackets for children. There are no toys there and none to buy close by. The hotel water sports provided do not have great children's life jackets. We brought one for our 4 yr old but not for our 8 yr old. He got stuck with some really worn out life jackets when we went Jet Skiing and snorkling.", "Date": "September 26, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barksdale AFB, LA", "Title": "\u201cYou could do alot better at the Barcelo Maya\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1354443", "Content": "You could do alot better at the Barcel\u00f3 Maya! My family and I do alot of traveling and have visited many places. I have been a Travel Agent for over 15 years and my family and I have very high standards so I think we are a good judge of things. We just got back from a stay at the Iberostar Quetzal/Tucan, we were very unhappy the food was Horrible, the same at every meal every day! unless you tried one of the specialty restaurants which your only allowed to eat at one or two times during your visit and their not that great! The rooms were dirty and the maids were not great, the beach was very dirty, garbage everywhere and all you could see was sun chair. The jungle on the property was very nice. But the Barcel\u00f3 Maya was by far a much better place to stay, the food their is suburb! and you felt you were the only people their because the property was so open and the beach so spread out and had so many mature palm trees. Save some money and go to the Barcel\u00f3 Maya and if you want some wild life go visit Xcaret.", "Date": "September 23, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Flower Mound, TX", "Title": "\u201cEntertainment was the best!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1269798", "Content": "I went there expecting one type of vacation and came away with a totally different experience! I can't say enough good about this place. I did tire of the buffet the last day, but we stayed 7 days. There was enough (food) variety to keep you going for each day. The entertainment kept me in stitches, a very humorous staff, I loved every minute of it, even the live singers were excellent! My kids enjoyed their time, they did tire of the Mini camp but we were relieved it was there for us to use so that we could spend some time with all of the activities around the resort. This resort was worth every penny no matter what, hands down! 7 days was perfect, enough time to do it all and we even got to see monkeys, birds, a wild cat and so many more things I don't have enough time to explain. Go, you won't regret it, that is unless you want a quiet vacation. You'll get quiet in your room but not on the grounds, so much fun and relaxing! ;-)", "Date": "August 30, 2003"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coral Gables, FL", "Title": "\u201cIberostar' s the best\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR1269591", "Content": "I went there with the fam and some friends a year ago and it was really great!

We wanted to try a new resort and we stayed at the Iberostar Quetzal. What a beautiful place, We stayed from the 10th of august until the 17th of august. The food I thought was a little bit better then down in punta cana, The room's were nice the housekeeping was fantastic, The service in the restaurant was very well mannered. We had a young fellow named Jose, he was very polite and kept us laughing. The weather was just beautiful. The guys went fishing for four hours, boy was this a treat, they treated us like kings did not touch the bait or anything for that matter, but we did catch some fish we caught four big barracuda's (31\" 35\" 38\" and a 45\"). If I have anything bad to say about this resort, it would be that they aloud children in the swim-up bar, not a good idea!!!, also they aloud children in the disco at nite which does not open until 10:30. But other than that the place was out of this world.

Not a honeymoon spot but teenagers love it . Not recommended for older people because of the pathways. Jungle setting which is nice but keeps the breeze from coming into the dining area, so it's stuffy in the main buffet area. The majority of your meals have to be buffett because you are only allowed two seatings per week in the nice reservation dining area which is air conditioned. Thefood was good but not excellent, the rooms were nice but the mattress's were rock hard. Seems tobe the norm in Mexico, the last resort was the sameway. Very nice beach area, but the main pool area was always warm water so not very refreshing. I liked the resort , but not as much as others.
