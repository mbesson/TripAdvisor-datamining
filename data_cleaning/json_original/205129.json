I booked a standard double room but upon our arrival was very disappointed when we were shown our room which was almost like a shoe box containing a double bed, a wardrobe,no dressing table and a tiny shower room. I am quite a petite person and even so had trouble negotiating the entrance to the bathroom as the only way in meant squeezing in between the door and the sink! Although very clean, the room looked 'tired' and in need of some re-decoration. There was also an adjoining door which led to another room whose occupants were a family with a baby who you could hear talking quite clearly, so obviously it didn't feel very private. Maybe we should have made our concerns known immediately but we decided to give it a try as we weren't planning on spending a lot of time in the room but after one night decided this was unacceptable. The hotel is classed as a four star but this room was definitely not four star accomodation. We expressed our concerns to the man on the desk the following morning, who said that we could change rooms and that the new room would be available later that day and there didn't seem to be a problem with this. The second room was much bigger and more comfortable and appeared to be something more like a four star and although very clean, still looked a bit shabby and the wallpaper was hanging off in one corner near the window. I'm not sure what the second room would be classed as and would be interested to see what a superior room was like.There was no extra charge for changing rooms.Breakfast was quite adequate with a selection of breads, pastries, fruit and juices. There also seemed to be other people who were not satisfied with their rooms as on two occasions we overheard people asking to be moved.The staff were friendly and helpful and we would return as the hotel is in an excellent location and as first time travellers to Rome we found it to be very convenient and would recommend it - a bit more attention to detail in the room decor would make a big difference.Hope other people will find this helpful", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wiesbaden, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, great hotel\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer D", "ReviewID": "UR128172364", "Content": "We just returned from a trip to Rome and stayed at the Hotel Rex, deciding on it based on it's good reviews. It did not disappoint! We had contacted the hotel via email about a week before our arrival to ask a few questions, confirm our reservation and make sure a crib was available for our 9 month old. They promptly replied and were very helpful in answering our questions. Upon arrival, the pack 'n' play was set up in our room and was was made- with a sheet, blanket and little pillow. So very nice since usually hotels deliver a pack 'n' play at the door, requiring you to set it up and most do not offer sheets/blankets/pillows to go with it. The room was a good size, a little tight, but that's European for you. It was a little dated, but clean and that's all that matters. We did get a little hot during the night- I'm not sure if the a/c didn't work or what, but we were so exhausted we slept well no matter what. The breakfast was AWESOME! A wonderful variety of hot dishes (egg soufle type dish, another hot dish I can't think of the name), meats, cheeses, yogurts, breads, cereals, pastries galore, fruit, OJ, cappuccino, latte, espresso, coffee Americano- a great way to fill up before you venture out into the city! And the kitchen staff were so friendly! The location is superb! We took the Leo Express from the airport, arrived at the Termini and was at our hotel within 5 minutes. We got there at about 1030 at night and felt safe (we walked from the Termini with our luggage and 9 month old son in a stroller). We walked to all of the locations in the city- the Colosseo/Forum/Palatine Hill, Vittorio Emmanule II monument, Spanish Steps, Trevi Fountain and numerous museums, piazzas and restaurants. We took the metro (from Termini) to the Vatican and the Aqueducts- 1 Euro each way and the bus to the Galleria Borghese- again, 1 Euro each way. Seriously easy to get to everything you need to from this hotel. The restaurant Strega is close by and we loved it so much we went twice (wood fired pizza!).

The room has a 'kettle pack' containing a few sachets of tea, coffee & a couple of milks. These have to last you the length of your stay or cost 1.50 Eu to get another.

There is a limit to how much time an 18yr old wants to spend with his Mum and whilst the Internet access in the library area was fine we wanted some time apart - leaving me offline in the room. After having to request a room move (it was not offered) we were transferred the following day - to a smaller, hotter and darker room looking out over the lift shaft. This seemed a little mean as the problem was not of our making. Also the patio area was closed due to renovations which meant standing in the street to smoke.

Franchesca was great help and always very pleasant to talk too, her English was very good. WiFi worked great, also they have a computer you can use with a printer that was free to use. Our room was 203 a little narrow but had a king bed and a twin for the three of us. The bathroom was a good size. Room was clean... no view from window. Breakfast was good a little different than in US but you left full and never got sick. Metro and termini a 10 minute walk. Some tips.... From airport Fromunico you can take Terrivision Bus 4 euros non stop to termini. Take a debit card to get euros at an ATM much cheaper than exchange places down there banks will not exchange US money there.... also buy some euros here at your bank. The Metro is cheap to use 1 euro 1 way or get an all day pass at front desk 4 euros. At restuarants ask for tap water, bread is not free, everything is extra... so just order what you want with no extras... say no if they put something on your table you do not want. You can bargain with some vendors.... example the ones on the street selling pocket books. If they want 40 euros offer them 10 to 15..... remember our exchange rate is not good there. Water is fine to drink there fountains etc..... The Metro is packed at some stops keep your wallet in front pocket or do not carry a pocket book. Most dress in jeans a black leather jacket and a scarp or gray top. Most younger women do not dye their and keep it long. Anyway everyone seems to dress the same.... take good walking shoes.... sneakers. Most streets are coble stone.

The location of the Hotel was good too, close to the Termini and within easy walking distance of all central tourist attractions, in fact the only time we used public transpiort was when we were short of time and got the 1 Euro ticket to Cipro to visit the Vatican City Museum saving us about 30 minutes.

I few of the places that we stayed did not provide this and it made our trip (while still wonderful) I little harder than it should have been.

Luckily, we thought ahead on this leg of our journey and booked the Hotel Rex via www.priceline.com. We actually happened upon it by chance as we used the \"name your own price\" feature on Priceline. This feature only allows you to select the star rating and general location of your hotel but not your actual hotel. Hotel Rex took our bid and we are so happy that they did. After many sleepless nights in a row the Hotel Rex provided several much needed nights of rest. The facility was very clean, the hotel staff was friendly and helpful and the rooms were QUIET!. No outside noise.... no noise from ajoining rooms. Just sweet quiet. :-) Another huge advantage to the Hotel Rex was that it was just a couple of blocks from Rome's main train station. This provided us quick and easy access to all international trains, the local metro and also the Rome bus system. There were also many shops and restaurants within a very short walk.

The neighbourhood seemed quite \"normal\" despite of Termini station being fairly close. We didn't see anything scary/suspicious, not even late at night.

Cappuccino / Caf\u00e9 Latte was fresh and delicious. Rooms: - We made our reservation through a website that didn't provide choice between double room and twin room. We were placed in a room with a double bed but didn't mind because it was more spacious than the twin rooms available at the moment. Our room was a bit lame but very clean and large enough. There was a sitting area as well as a writing desk, and enough space for our clothes (and shopping bags!). Bathroom was fairly large but a bit aged.

(I was one of 2 staff leading a group of 16 students.) Located near the Termini (main train/metro station), so very convenient to get around the city, but not necessarily in walking distance to main sites. It is only a couple of blocks from a piazza that offered convenience stores, counter and table service restaurants (local and McDonalds), and plenty of gelato shops! We all loved all the food we had for our entire stay! Most locals did not speak English, but we still did ok. Some restaurants even had English menus. A bank with an international ATM was right across the street. The Hotel Rex is NOT appropriate for someone with physical challenges, as there were stairs into the hotel, as well as to our room floor (located between two primary floors). The hotel is divided in two halves from the reception desk; you cannot get from one side to the other without going down to the reception, across, and back up. There are a few \"split\" floors that made it very confusing to find others in our group. While at least one elevator was working during our entire stay; they were working on one in the afternoon, which presented loud banging (hammer on steel) in a large portion of the hotel. The elevator also did not have the usual safety feature, so if you stuck your arm in to hold the door, it would smash your arm! This hotel would likely be rated a 2 Star in the states - just the basics, not even a vending machine. My single room was very much like a single room in a university residence hall. The bed was clean and comfy. The bathroom also clean and the newest part of the entire room. Like all of Europe, there are no outlets (other than one for razors) in the bathroom. The shower had clear glass, so plenty of light and an adjustable shower head. There was also a towel heater. Also like most European hotels, they do not have washcloths. The room offered a smallish (21\"?) flat screen TV and a PlayStation. The only English channel was BBC World. The front desk had free DVD rentals for use on the PlayStation, which I did use (Mission: Impossible and Minority Report). The room keys (yes, key - not card) are on a HUGE & HEAVY key chain, as they make you turn in your key every time you leave the hotel. There is NO air conditioning in the entire hotel, even though there was a locked panel on the wall. It was quite warm during our stay (high 70s/low 80s) and just opening the window was not enough for me. (I like to sleep at about 65F). Thankfully, I brought a Vornado travel fan and sleeping pills! The hotel does have a very small outdoor patio off the 2nd floor. Unfortunately my room was across from it and a noisy group kept me away/awoke me from a dead sleep at 2am. I had to call the front desk and they did deal with the noisy group. All of the furniture, carpet, & wallpaper looked very old, perhaps from the 70s and was in poor shape/coming apart. There was a safe in the closet, but I did not use it. The included breakfast was quite good (meats, breads, pastries, cereals, coffee, juices, and plenty of Nutella!), the single egg dish was consistently cold. Although the breakfast room was hidden in the basement, it's bright decor & white furniture brought a lovely kitchen feel. This is very much a \"group booking\" hotel for international travelers. Besides my American group, there was also a group of Asians. I never heard a single Italian person, other than the staff for our entire visit. The staff was quite helpful and was able to negotiate English pretty well (except for the tech who had to fix the PlayStation). The included wi-fi was spotty. Some afternoons it worked fine, while some evenings it was totally offline. One day I couldn't get the wi-fi to work, so I went down to use the one Apple computer in the \"waiting room\". Apparently their entire system, including the staff computers were offline. It took 4-5 hours for the service to be reinstated. While we loved Rome, if/when I return, I will not stay at Hotel Rex.

I think this may be true of the area directly around the train station but the area around the hotel is just fine and we walked from it to all of the main attractions. So why did we like it... - It has a personal feel to it, you know you are not stopping in a chain hotel - The bar area is lovely and the drink prices reasonable - Near the bar there is also lovely library area with games and a cinema room, on one of the nights they were doing tango lessons in the cinema room - The reasonable location as mentioned - The breakfast room is pleasant and the selection of food on offer was fine to get a bit of some thing inside you before you explore the streets of Rome - The room was spacious - There was adequate space to put your cases ( we often find in hotels you have to leave them in a walkway) - The mini fridge in the room actually kept the drinks cold - The wifi was free and code given with out having to request it - Free safe - And the best thing for us was the bed was massive and wonderfully comfy. We had the best nights sleep we have probably ever had in a hotel I think Trip Advisor can bring out the Hotel Inspector in you and in this respect there were a couple of things that could have been improved but on the whole we were really happy with the hotel. Just in case they help you decide whether to book or not the things that could be improved were... - The bathroom tiles around the shower and bath were a bit grimey and mouldy - There was a sewage smell in the bathroom. It did improve if we left the toilet seat lid down. But if we forgot the smell was pretty strong. (We didn't mention this to any of the staff) - There was no outside window in the room, there was a window but it opened on to what looked like the lift shaft. As we were there in Winter it wasn't such an issue for us but I would like to be in the room we stopped in if it was warmer.

During our second stay we arrived by train from Firenze so we simply walked to the hotel which is minutes away from the train station. Our reservation included breakfast which is served is a modest but clean basement area. It was a breaskfast buffet offering a variety of continental choices. The food was simple but tasty. We especially enjoyed the homemade cappuccino they served us in conveniently large bowls. During our first stay, we arrived late afternoon and did not have any plans for sightseeing.

The large outdoor terrace was really nice, although it seemed that all of the rooms with outdoor space shared the same terrace. The terrace areas specific to each room were blocked off with flower planters and such, so I'd suggest if you want a very private or intimate balcony go elsewhere, although for our group of friends celebrating a birthday it was perfect. There was plenty of terrace space that included a dining table, basketball hoop, lounge chairs and a broken foosball table. Inside the room was not spotless, but relatively clean and comfortable. The shower was large and sophisticated, though hard to get in and out of and difficult to use. The room seemed to have many high-tech features, but no info on how to use them so we didn't really take advantage of that. The closet in the room was AMAZING. It was a walk in closet, with unbelievable amounts of space for our things, but clearly it didn't get much use and was somewhat dusty. The bed left a lot to be desired, but didn't prevent me from getting a good night's sleep. Our mini fridge was restocked each day when the room was cleaned, but I don\u2019t think there was anything to drink besides water and maybe PowerAde or something like it. No biggie though- the hotel bar was small but nice, although it seemed like the person working the front desk at night was sometimes also the bartender. The staff was nice upon checking us in, but we encountered several issues which could have been avoided. Twice the front desk relayed a message left with them for us incorrectly, and they gave us a hard time about one member of our party joining us late. We were supposed to have an extra bed in our room on the last night for him, but they claimed to never have known this was the case. First the man at the front desk said he didn't know where the cots were kept, then it was that he was alone and couldn't leave to get it for us, then he tried to say it wouldn't fit in the room... there was a million excuses this guy came up with as to why there was no place for him to sleep. Our friend ended up paying for a single room at a discounted rate, but by the time this was settled it was too late for us to go out anywhere, which really put a damper on our last night in the eternal city. This place was in a very good location- right near a beautiful old church and within walking distance to Termini, but tucked on a quiet side street out of the way.

The Hotel Rex was around \u00a390 a night, cheap for Rome, ad seemed to be in a reasonable location. On our arrival we got a Terravision Coach from Ciampino Airport which dropped us off at the main Train Station in Rome. This was at most a 10 minute walk to the hotel. Perfect in my eyes for arriving and departing. Everything else was a nice walk away, and considering everything in Rome is more or less \"Historic\" you end up falling over lovely Churches and Piazzas enroute to the main attractions. Also around the Hotel were a couple of lovely restaurants, Cotto being our personal favourite. The staff at the hotel were lovely. As an ignorant English couple we struggled with the language, but the staff quite happily switched to English and appreciated our effort. All the staff we dealt with were extremely helpful and friendly and couldn't ask for much more. The room itself was large, and spacious. It had a lcd v with Sky TV, a PS2 and DVD player. Bathroom was okay. It was large and clean but could probably do with an upgrade really. Did the job for us though. We chose breakfast one morning which was 10 euros each.

It's our last trip as a couple, we are expecting our first child in June! We booked through Airmiles and stayed at The Rex as this was part of an offer they were running, rather than our choice. As it was billed as central and four star, we thought it was ideal. Our room was quite small, very dark, the bathroom was small, basic, and a little dated. There was a tv with basic sky news and bbc world news, plus a playstation 2 with game and dvd's available through reception. However, don't forget to ask for the controller. The main problem was the heating was unbearable. It was switched on to the maximum without any ability for us to control the temperature. We asked three time for this to be attended to and we were told it was unable to be fixed and we were suggested to sleep with the balcony doors open. This meant that at 5am every morning we awoke to the sound of the market in the opposit street being set up with reversing lorries making deliveries and scaffolding being erected for the stalls. Not ideal! The breakfast was included and this was served in a basement room. It was very bright and clean, the service was excellent. There was a selection of ham, cheeses, croissants, rolls and toast. Fresh juices were also available. The waitress offers coffee, or there was an automatic machine. The location is about a ten minute walk to the Termini (where the main Airport trains run to). This is useful when visiting any of the main tourist locations as both the A and B metro trains run from here. However, be aware of pickpockets & beggers in the termini building. There are a few restaurants nearby, however, there isn't a great selection, try nearer to the main attractions. Fir sport fans there is an Irish pub almost opposite the entrance to the Via Torino from the main road that is friendly and shows English football games, as well as Rugby.

The hotel is a 5 to 6 minute walk from the Termini Station and 20 to 30 minutes from the historic city centre and other attractions. The nearest Metro was just 3 to 4 minutes walk from the hotel. The exterior of the hotel doesn't do it justice, the interior is nice and worthy of its stars - though not 'grand' by any means. I think that the interior has been redecorated in part since the photos were published. Our room was nicely decorated, the bed was large (2 singles together) and extremely comfortable, the bathroom (comprising shower cubicle, wash basin, toilet and bidet) was large enough, and all immaculately clean except the bedroom carpet. Upon check-in, we asked for a room with ocean-view which we were given (it was pouring down with rain, massive thunderstorm, and the roads and pavement were like an ocean!!!). Our room wasn't massive but perfectly adequate. We had a widescreen LCD television with its own sky box and fairly good choice of channels. There was also a playstation box but we didn't make use of this as we were out for much of the day. The minibar was well stocked. The room safe was useful. The breakfast was great, two tables of choice from fresh fruit to fresh bread, cooked eggs, bacon and sausages, pastries, cereal, fruit juice etc. The two waitresses were very attentive. All members of staff were extremely polite and courteous, in fact, they pretty much bent over backwards to ensure that we were having a great time in Rome. We were awoken at 6am on the final day by the fire alarm, we duly got dressed and made our way down the stairs only to be told that the delivery of newspapers had set the alarm off - I was half asleep and still don't get the logic there. Whilst the weather was much milder, it was still in the mid 20's and very humid and warm at night. Air conditioning would have done the trick, however, it was turned off, presumably as this is their winter (I'm used to that temperature in mid summer!). We used the hotel internet facility once, just 2 Euros for an hour which I thought was very reasonable. Only downside was the slow connection, waiting and waiting. Probably only really got 20 minutes worth of use during that hour. There is, apparently, a roof top terrace but we couldn't find it. Perhaps it was closed for winter but we didn't ask about it. We ate out at a nearby restaurant recommended by the hotel (it was called something like Giglio Bianca). When we arrived, we observed 2 separate tables arguing with the waiters over the food and they both left without paying for certain parts of the meal. Perhaps this would have been a good time for us to have left, but we went ahead and ordered, and were deeply disappointed with our meals and the terrible service. We ate twice at one restaurant some 3 to 4 minutes away. I have the receipt but I'm not sure which part of it is the name of the restaurant! But it says \"S.I. Acquisto Unicum, P.Za Di S.M. Maggiore 164\" which looks like an address at least. Ask the hotel to guide you there and you won't be disappointed. The steak was juicy and cooked to absolute perfection. The waiters were chatty, funny and friendly. Given that this hotel was in the centre of the city, the noise (especially that of traffic) was as expected. The windows were double glazed but you wouldn't have guessed that with the level of noise first thing in the morning. Check out was as quick as \"thank you, have a nice day!\".

If you want a good location, professional and helpful staff and cleanliness without the expense then this is the place. Location-Hotel Rex is a few minutes walk from the Termini Station in the city. We caught the Leonardo Da Vinci Express from Fiumicino Aiport cost 11 euro's. It takes around 25 minutes to arrive at termini non stop. Once at Termini come out of the station and turn right pass the Mcdonalds(yes there is one here too ) take a left at the big set of traffic lights(onto Via Cavour) the hotel is approx fourth turn on your right (Via Torino) not worth getting a taxi as it is literally a few minutes walk. Almost Everything is within walking distance between 15- 20 minutes taxi's are available only use the white registered ones. They have meters.You have two attractions on your doorstep literally. Santa Maria Magiorre is one end of the road, the other end is the Opera House. Check In- Quick efficient and the reception staff were extremely helpful. Upon check in they provide a free map of the city and point out where you are and where the main attractions are. All hotel information and breakfast times provided. You are provided with a list of restuarants in the immediate area. The reception staff are accomodating nothing seems too much trouble so just ask. They are all helpful and multi lingual (a big mention to Laura thanks for everything you are a star). Check Out-swift no problems Rooms-We were on 1st floor (Lift available) and had a triple room en suite clean, spacious, tv, internet access, fridge,air conditioning which was fab given temperatures were 27-30 degrees everyday. The room was cleaned daily and fresh towels provided daily as required. The maid would come to the room wilst we were out and turn down your sheets and put the bedside lamp on leaving a goodnight card and a sweet(written in italian of course). These are the little touches that make this place special. The decor was a little dated in our room but that didnt matter. Its not going to be to everyone's liking. There is an outside terrace area on the 3rd floor with sun loungers and it is peaceful check it out. Food- We stayed bed and continental breakfast which was fine. Good selection of breads, fresh meats, chees, pastries, hot and cold drinks. Fruits, cereal. Even the fussiest eater would find something. The breakfast area is small but perfectly formed. (see pictures) Tip-Get to breakfast before 9am it tends to get busy later and the choice is limited. There is a lobby area and bar where you can access evening drinks off the menu the hot chocolate is yummy... Public Transport- The options are buses, underground metro, taxi's, tour buses. The metro is cheap, easy to navigate and air conditioned. Cost is 1 euro each way. Tickets can be bought at newstands, tobaccanists or ticket machines at the metro station. The machines operate mulit lingual also. If you take any buses including the trains you must use the yellow machines to validate your ticket before you get on train or bus. Metro is fine as the turnstile machines will stamp it for you. Your ticket has an expiry time of 75 minutes. It can ony be used on metro once but on buses multiple times within the 75 minute period. Tour Buses-There are many tour buses taking you to different attractions. We used the green \"tour rome bus\" 17 euro's for 24 hour ticket and takes you to all the main attractions. Its hop on hop off which is great you can get on and off as many times as you like within the 24 hours period. 24 hour period starts from the time you buy the ticket. The tickets/tour buses are available from termini station. I could go on forever but I wont. We will be returning to the Hotel Rex which I believe speaks volumes. It isworthy of its stars.

The worst beds I have ever slept on.", "Date": "September 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cAverage and Overpriced\u201d", "Author": "Mark23", "ReviewID": "UR5802124", "Content": "The best thing about this hotel is its location which is fairly central. Although 4 star, the level of luxury in the hotel falls well short of such standard. Both the exterior and internal furnishings of the hotel are unimpressive. The rooms nevertheless are very spacious. I found the staff not particularly friendly. When arriving down to breakfast on the dot of 10.30, when the breakfast was to finish, the staff created an unnecessary fuss. They spoke across in Italian and judging by their tone, it was giving out. This was quite embarrassing. The hotel also has the extremely old fashioned and intrusive policy of requiring guests to leave the key in at reception when going out. This was not an option -we were told we had too so. Overall I would expect more for the price and better treatment.", "Date": "September 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saratoga Springs, NY", "Title": "\u201cQuaint and clean place\u201d", "Author": "LisheVillage", "ReviewID": "UR4385379", "Content": "Wonderful time, nice staff, clean room and great breakfast.
