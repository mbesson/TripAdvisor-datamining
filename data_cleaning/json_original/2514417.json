There were nice amenities, shampoo, conditioner and lotion in the bathrooms, and the towels were plentiful and soft. The linens on the bed were clean and the beds themselves were comfortable. If you have ever stayed in this area, you already know there isn't much action around. We usually end up booking near Wall Street because we get cheaper rooms, more money for shopping and eating. Century 21 is nearby, as well as Ground Zero. There are plenty of subway stations close in order to get to Times Square, Chinatown and Soho, which is where we spent most of our time.

The hotel staff is friendly. I know using priceline.com sometimes your flight times will not correspond with hotel check in times but we were able to drop off luggage and continue with the day. I called the hotel later that day (before the 3 PM check in time) and requested a room on a higher floor if possible and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would try to get a room on a higher floor if available (we were able to see the top of the 1 World Trade tower from our room) because there are buildings on every side and it looked like views on the lower floors might be limited. As far as amenities it was everything we needed. Coffee maker and free coffee, iron and ironing board, TV (basic cable and I think HBO), very comfortable bed, Heat/A/C unit below the window with a thermostat on the wall which is not annoying or creaky but makes a nice sound at night which helped me sleep and drowns out any outside noise, there is a vending and ice machine on the 2nd floor and a restaurant on the 1st floor (I didn't eat there so I won't comment on it but I know it was open early in the morning but closed when we returned around 11 PM). There are a couple of computers that you can stand up and use right by the elevators but I wouldn't expect to surf the web or anything. I guess they might come in handy if you forgot to print some tickets, itinerary or needed to check your email real quick. The area is very quiet at night and on the weekends which was fine with me (no outside noise, slept great) because you are a 2 minute walk from the Fulton Street subway station that gets you anywhere in the city at anytime of the day or night. There is also a 24 hr CVS right up the street if you need to pick up anything that you might have forgotten or might be prohibited to take on a plane. I enjoyed the area overall though. You are a very quick walk from Wall Street, Trinity Church, Federal Hall, World Trade Center Site ect. The only thing I would suggest is that if you are in Midtown you probably should eat or get food to bring back up there because after 9-10 PM a lot of the restaurants in close walking distance to the hotel are closed. There are a few places open but your selection is very limited.

The hotel is tall and narrow (20 stories, 5 rooms per floor) and you could easily walk by it without noticing, particularly given the scaffolding that is still up around it. I'd been staying in another hotel the night before so arrived at the appointed 3pm check-in time only to be told that there weren't rooms available - there seemed to be a few people in this situation and, as others have noted, the lobby is pretty small so by the time you have a few travellers with their luggage it gets a bit cramped! They took my luggage and I came back later, but the room still had to be \"inspected\" so another few minutes of waiting around. Taking one of the two elevators (never seemed to have a long wait, which was great) to the 18th floor I found the room to be absolutely fine - a bit on the small side but comfortable bed. It was good to have an iron and coffee making facilities in the room, and the free wi-fi (that other hotels are charging $15 for) was a real bonus, but a shame that there wasn't an in-room safe for passports etc.. The room was quiet, but with no views. It was generally clean, but there did seem to be an issue with the toilet plumbing which meant it wouldn't empty - not very pleasant :-( The hotel itself if just moments from Century 21 / J&R (shoppers' paradise!) and there are a good number of drug stores / fast food places / coffee shops within very easy reach.

The other one was that housekeeping kept reducing the number of towels we got. We started off with 3 bath towels. The next day we were down to 2 and the bath mat was gone. Then we had 1. We called housekeeping to ask for more towels but they didn't answer. Front desk didn't seem to care much. They said they couldn't find the housekeeping person (maybe they were trapped in the broken elevator). I dried off after a shower with a face cloth I think.... Last service thing - when we were checking out, it was pouring. Front desk woman asked if we wanted her to get us a car. We said we just wanted a cab and she nodded and confirmed \"just a cab\". 10 min later the car service she called (not a cab) pulls up and tries to quote us $20 more than the usual cab fare to LGA. We told him to take a hike and got wet and just hailed one ourselves. It's not a bad place. Very close to major subway stations. Tribeca, Chinatown and the LES is walkable.

Now having worked in hospitality myself, in NYC as well, I know a thing or two about the \"little things\" to make sure the customers stay is happy and are accommodated. The Holiday Inn-Wall Street could've easily been a 5 star stay but they did their best to sabotage themselves. 1) - We arrived at 430pm to check into our room on a thursday to a crowded, surly group of customers ahead of us with their own problems, and seemingly uncaring staff of only 1 active worker at the desk engaging customers. Check-in begins at 3pm and yet there was still not one room available for us due to too many late check-outs. That is simply unacceptable and so easily remedied. 2) - We also had another group of 2 on our reservation who arrived on the red eye and was also denied a room for over 4 hours due to the over-selling of the hotel the previous night. They tried 3 different times to be moved to a room with a king size bed (as per the specs in our reservation) and each time were re-buffed and told to wait. On the third and final attempt the manager spoke to them and informed them they would be unable to be moved yet he could offer to sign them up for the holiday inn rewards program and give them a slew of points for a future stay. They declined as they have no plans to stay at another holiday inn any more. Based on my experience of working in a boutique NYC hotel, I can tell you without a doubt, that the reason my friends were not moved had nothing to do with the hotel's over booking, but their unwillingness to take that extra step. A self-inflicted wound that also, could've been so easily fixed if someone in upper management had seen this problem through. 3) - After our first night, we hung our large bath towels up on the rack planning to use them again. However they were inexplicably removed and NOT replaced. We got all our little teeny towels replenished, but not the ones that matter. I called down to the front office and informed them and the woman had replied she would have some sent up soon. After 2 hours, we got a knock on our door where a gentleman literally asked us if we were \"sure\" we still needed the large towels. Are you kidding me? We finally received our towels sometime during the evening when we were away. So much for having a shower before going out. 4) - On our last night, it was after 10pm and I wanted to know which, if any, pizza places nearby were still open. I called the front desk and the woman hurried me off the phone and told me she would call me back. She never did. This was the systemic customer service attitude that, once again, could have so easily been fixed. The good you ask?

Even if I was aware the rooms were small, I based my choice on a misleading commentary left by someone here, which lead me to think the beds were not in the same room and that it was rather a suite. English not being my mother tongue might have played in this mistake. Despite of comfortable and large beds, the room was indeed too small for our 1 week stay. Moving around was not very easy, and getting stuff in our luggages was a bit tricky! We decided to take an additional bedroom so we could really enjoy our stay. The second room was relatively bigger than the first one. The staff was nice (for most of them, except for a lady who didn't seem to like her job...), everything was working fine, towels were clean. The location is great if you are a first timer in NYC. You're not far from the WTC, Battery Park, Stock Exchange. However, you figure out quickly that the heart of the city is downtown, and to get there, you either have to walk an hour at least, try to figure out how to use the NYC subway (I've taken a lot of public transportation lines over various countries and the NY Subway is the most complicated I've seen) or a cab. So here is my list of pros and cons: PRO *Comfortable rooms *Nice staff overall (the gentleman especially) *very quiet, even on week days *you can easily find something for a breakfast or quick dinner in the neighborhood *super fast lifts *not far from *some* major landmarks *super easy to catch a cab, even in the the small streets nearby CONS *dark (but that's the whole city) *we noticed a bit of dust from time to time and it seems that the room was not hovered frequently *inconvenient showers: you have to get through cold to get warm water, and half of it ends up outside of the shower! You therefore have to drop towers on the ground. The hotel would save money by installing a glassed wall, since all the towels used to sponge the water have to be changed! *it might be a cultural difference between Europeans and Americans, but I found disturbing to always find my bedroom fully lit up when returning. It's unnecessary and not very environment friendly (and I'm no tree hugger) *lack of foreign speaking staff. It was OK for me, since I get me understood in English or Spanish. However other members of my family didn't speak any word of English. If they had had to deal with the staff, I wonder how they would have done. But I don't blame the hotel itself, it's a general problem to NYC. NYers are always willing to help, we ended up lost in Washington Heights and someone even offered us to drive us (that was not a gypsy taxi or a limo driver).", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cWarm and friendly stay\u201d", "Author": "rikkitex", "ReviewID": "UR88020493", "Content": "This place was definately worth the price.

Elevators aren't key card type so anyone could wander in from the street. - We were due to see a baseball game but it had been raining and we wondered if it was cancelled.

Both rooms were clean and well presented and the bathrooms were lovely with great showers. Beds were comfy and big.

My only complaint was that when we got to the airport, the driver told us that it was going to cost $75. I don't know if the hotel employee and the driver had a deal together, but I hate getting scammed and this felt like a scam to me. I called the hotel and spoke with a manager to explain to him what had happened. He told me he would call me back and let me know the results of his investigation, but I never heard back.

On arrival the hotel could not find our booking and we waited over a hour for them to sort out the problem. We were asked to leave a card as normal for any addtional billing at the desk. During our stay my credit card company called me to say a hotel bill had been charged from the hotel. I checked this with the front desk and they said nothing had been billed. Again on leaving we checked nothing had been billed and were assured it hadn't. On reciving my bill a month later there is the hotel bill in full! The hotel have refunded this but not without me calling them and having to deal with the card company too. This is not an excusable error as we had checked with them so many times. The hotel rooms are very small and far too cramped for a family to use, pay the extra and go elsewhere.

If you're vacationing for any other reason, forget it. It's clean and livable, but very small, and not very hip. The lobby is extremely tiny and the service is mediocre at best. On the second day of my stay my room hadn\u2019t been serviced by 4:30 PM. When I asked why, I was told if my \"do not disturb\" sign was on the door at 8:30 AM, I wouldn't be put on the list for maid service. I was on vacation and had no intention of getting up at 8:30 AM and did not want to be disturbed. I complained and got this long-winded story about the hotel being a business/corporate hotel, so most guests are up and out by 8:30 AM. Who cares! I wanted my room serviced and that was that. Also, I was a little peeved the business center is part of the restaurant that's connected to the hotel. Once the restaurant closes for the night, there was no access to the business center. Lastly, the walls are extremely thin and the mechanism used to prevent doors from slamming was absent. That being said, you will be awakened at all times of the day/night by slamming doors. The only pluses are the hotel uses H2O toiletries, it's located a block from good shopping and restaurants, and it's very close to the subway. Other than that, it's just an OK hotel.

We had never stayed in the Financial District, but we really enjoyed it. There are several subway stations within walking distance of the hotel, & more restaurants nearby than I was expecting. (Try Financier Patisserie, basically right around the corner, for fabulous pastries - including to-die-for macaroons - & coffee for breakfast.)

It is an excellent hotel and was great for our stay in Manhattan. Our room was spacious, clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was a reasonable size with a good shower and was kept very clean. The room came with tv, hairdryer, iron and ironing board and coffee-maker. Located just off Broadway and Wall Street and very close to the WTC site, it is very easy to get subway access to the whole of Manhattan as there are multiple stations within a five minute walk of the hotel. It is located in a quiet area of the financial district and we had no problems with noise. I'd definitely recommend checking out some of the cafes and delis located in the area for breakfast and brunch. We generally ate out in other areas of Manhattan, such as Greenwich (if you like Mexican food, check out Maraccas restaurant - great food and service!) and then travelled back by subway. Definitely check out Weekend closures and changes on the subway as this proved a problem for us on a Saturday when we were catching it to JFK airport. I would recommend the subway as a method to travel between JFK and Manhattan, very cheap and easy to use.

Things do tend to shut down on the weekend, but there are restaurants that stay open. On a Sunday however you need to go a bit further out to TriBeCa or somewhere to eat. We walked back from there to the hotel easily enough. Following on from other comments on this site, we were not charged to leave our luggage after checking out (not that USD 2 per item is a lot). Apparently, they only charge when they have limited storage space. Would definitely return - there are plenty of subway stations around to get about.

We arrived at the hotel around 10am on 9/4 \u2013 several hours prior to check-in. The desk clerk at first had an issue finding my reservation (which I made on Travelocity) but then it turned up on my computer. She told me the earliest we could check in was 3pm, but that we could certainly leave our bags at the hotel for no cost. We returned promptly at 3pm and attempted to check in with another desk clerk, who also had issues finding my reservation. It sounded like a miscommunication error on their part, and my friend and I had to wait about 15 minutes for them to sort things out. This was the only somewhat negative experience we had. Hotel Reserve is a typical boutique hotel \u2013 the lobby is quite small but has a chair and couch. Right down the hallway is a computer that is free for guests to use \u2013 a bonus! I never had to wait to use it. The desk clerks were all extremely friendly and waved hello and goodbye every time we came and left. There are about 20 floors with maybe five rooms per floor. Ours was a standard with just a double bed and an armchair. It was a little on the small side, but that didn\u2019t matter much since we literally only used the hotel room to sleep. There was a nice TV mounted on the wall, though I found the channel selection limited. The location was excellent. The 4 & 5 trains are just two blocks away, as are the New York Stock Exchange and Ground Zero. The one odd thing was the shower. It was not a tub, and I hesitate to even call it a shower stall. In the corner, there was just a little shower curtain that hung and that was it. The floor was raised a little bit and while I was a bit nervous that water would get all over the bathroom floor, we did not experience this problem. There\u2019s a restaurant attached to the hotel and the food is decent, if slightly overpriced (but what restaurant in NYC isn\u2019t?). We went for both breakfast and lunch, and of the two I recommend the breakfast. A few previous reviews mentioned that this area of town shut down after 5pm and on the weekends, but I didn\u2019t experience this. After a night out at the bars, my friends and I visited a Papa John\u2019s right around the corner and it was open until 2am. There were several restaurants and shops that seemed to keep normal business hours. The day of check-out, our flight didn\u2019t leave until 8:30pm and we had to pay a very small fee for the hotel to hold our bags (maybe $2-$4 each \u2013 I can\u2019t remember).
