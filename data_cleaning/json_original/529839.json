We took an ensuite room, but the shower and toilet were similar to a caravans facilities! We had noise from the upstairs neighbours every night, running what sounded like a washing machine through the night?!

We were the only people staying in the hotel at the time, in February 2012 and during a particularly cold snap. The shared bathroom was very clean and had a good shower. The room was basic but again clean white sheets and comfortable bed, with space to put our luggage. There is also a sink in the bedroom so that was good for brushing teeth etc. The location was good, 15 minute walk to Termini (more like 20 or so when it was pelting down snow!). There is a supermarket on the way to stock up on food and drinks away from the tourist areas. The couple who ran the hotel were friendly, did not speak much English, and as it was also their home they requested us to not slam the door and things like that- so if you're wanting somewhere big and anonymous and are planning to be loud, this is not the place for you. The lack of breakfast was not an issue as we ate at nearby bakeries, and at the 'pizza al taglio' around the corner- fantastic pizza. the only thing i was unhappy with was that it was a bit too cold- all of our clothes were sopping wet each day due to the snow, and with only one small radiator on very low, it was impossible to dry out clothes before the morning. still, i didnt ask, so maybe they would have been happy to turn it up. would happily stay here again and recommend it highly as a reliable, clean, comfortable budget option.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Utrecht, The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cGreat value\u201d", "Author": "WendelvB", "ReviewID": "UR122867792", "Content": "The hotel is about 1 km away from Termini station in a quiet street.

The price was right (E-65/night) and not all that far from the central Roma train station. The front of the building has a 12' high double door (large enough for a car to drive through, which did happen during our stay) that opens onto a courtyard. The hotel is actually on the third floor of the building. We needed 4 keys to enter through 4 doors to get into our room....not a problem. Our room was comfortable with a private bath (rooms with shared baths were a little cheaper but not by much). The night was quiet and peaceful until 7AM when a business in the building started a pounding noise. At 7:30 I heard a car start and looked out the window into the courtyard to see someone drive out through the front double doors. Overall we enjoyed the place, true Italians, very friendly and accomodating. We went into the owner's apartment to pay. A nice first night in Italy experience, close to a few restaurants and a great gelato place right across the street. Not a touristy location, where the locals live and hang out.

As others have said, it's not a hotel but an apartment, but that wasn't a problem for us - we just wanted a place to rest our heads for a couple of nights. The room was a good size, very clean and tidy, and the owner was friendly and welcoming. The bathroom is shared but was never a problem, although it wasn't in amazing condition and the shower is quite small! But that is probably the only \"negative\" thing I can say about this place, plus because the owner and her family live in a separate living area they are not always immediately on hand like in a hotel. It was very easy to find (with a map anyway, it's down a couple of side roads so I'd recommend printing off a Google directions map unless you get a taxi) and very close to the Termini rail/bus stations and a few attractions.

It is a pensione, and the distinction is important. The pensione occupies part of a multi-storey building. This means that the owner does not control what happens elsewhere in the building. On two of the three nights of my stay, builders were working very noisily elsewhere in the building until 11:30 pm. The pensione is also round the corner from a lively restaurant. From room 6, you can hear the kitchen staff washing dishes until about midnight. The pensione itself is very well run. It is clean, it is very good value for central Rome, and the owner is friendly. Other reviews have mentioned the absence of air-con. Although true, it would be unfair to hold that against the place, because electricity is just plain expensive in Italy. A/C is just not that common at this price (I paid \u20ac45/night for a single, shared bath, in late Sep). As with most other inexpensive accommodation, the doors are thin: I expected this. However, perhaps the owner could use a sander on the doors, because, in their current condition, they fit so tightly into their frames that it is impossible to close them without their squeaking. At least the owner has put signs up reminding people not to slam doors! Just to be clear, for me the noise issue was the external noise, not the inevitable noise from the one or two other guests at every hotel who still haven't figured out how to be quiet in shared accommodation.", "Date": "October 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNot quite what we expected.\u201d", "Author": "Hme1992", "ReviewID": "UR115765465", "Content": "We arrived quickly as the location is close to the train station and checked in many hours ahead of schedule but this was fine our room was ready which was very good service.

First, I don't think it was the safest area. It was near the train station (which, yes, I knew) but it was on a farily quiet street, where I would have felt slightly scared walking at night. Then, the room had no fan, no A/c, nothing but a window over an airless courtyard, where you could hear everything....I mean everything the neighbours were doing. The room was very dirty on the floor, althouh the sheets were clean. The bed was a single metal cot, with a mattress with a lump so big that you could only lie on 1/2 the bed at a time.

Hotel Kristi is basically an apartment where some rooms have been converted into \"hotel\" rooms, so don't expect to find a front desk, lobby, or large signs for Hotel Kristi on the outside of the building, there's only a small plaque by the door which you can only read if you are standing right outside the door. The hotel is run by a nice family who live on the premises. The father was a pretty nice guy. I stayed in a single bed room with a bathroom. The room and bathroom were small but clean. There is no TV in the room. The shower is a tight fit so if you are a tall or large person you may find it uncomfortable. I got a bit of a scolding from the lady there for making too much noise when it was late, it was a little before midnight. So if you are the type who parties all night or who makes a lot of noise in your room, you might want to look elsewhere. If you are really late checking in like after midnight, make sure to clear it with them before you book. As a place just to sleep and shower, Hotel Kristi is fine. With so many things to do in Rome, why spend much time in your hotel room anyways? It's about a 15 minute walk to the Termini station to the hotel. The closest Metro station is Repubblica and that's about a 10 minute walk. There's a bus stop right around the corner from the hotel on Piave where the 38, 88, 92, and 217 buses all stop. There's also some pasta restaurants and a gelato place a few steps away from the hotel, I didn't try any of them so I can't comment on their quality. Another reviewer mentioned they walked to Trevi Fountains from the hotel, that is quite a long walk, I'd say 30 minutes at least. None of the major tourists attractions are in short walking distance from the hotel.
