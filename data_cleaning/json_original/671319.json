{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Noisy and dirty Our room was very noisy. It overlooked a motorcycle parkade, a busy intersection with a bus route, and a cafe. There was no soundproofing. The motorcycles woke us up as early as 6 am and kept us awake past midnight. The floors of the bedrooms and the bathrooms were dirty. The service was poor. There is no one on duty in the evenings and no phones in the rooms, so when my husband became ill, we were on our own and not able to get help.", "Date": "Jul 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR871323308", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "AllyVancouver"}, {"Content": "ok hotel Our travel agent booked us into this hotel after our original hotel closed down halfway through our travels. it is on the 2nd floor of a secure apartment block .we arrived at 3pm and found we couldnt get in luckily someone else was coming out the door so we got in. when we got to the 2nd floor there was no reception just rooms and we found our name on a apartment door with the key in the door. very strange... we found out at breakfast the next morning (after we found out were it was on our own ) that the office closes at 12pm VERY CONVIENIENT!!!  the room was actually ok and quiet large with a decent size bathroom .the breakfast was ok but the size of the breakfast room was a joke .once you were seated you could barely get out to serve yourself without 5 other people moving for you.  the location is its best point it is a 15min walk from train station and about a 10 min walk to duomo .Buses stop right at the door which can take you pretty much anywhere you want to go. there are plenty of restaurants and takeaways around as well as convieniance stores.i think it was ok for the price we paid", "Date": "Sep 19, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR546745868", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "balmainboy"}, {"Content": "Il migliore bed n\u9225?breakfast di Firenze? \u9225\u6de9elais Dante e Beatrice\u9225?#x201d;   showReview(23222983, 'full');", "Date": "Jan 3, 2009", "ReviewID": "UR841756979", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "ContiUgolini"}, {"Content": "Ottimo B   showReview(22833200, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR420753272", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "cs80"}, {"Content": "A 10 minuti a piedi dal Duomo...   showReview(21417810, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR844126192", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "incantevole esperienza al relais Dante e beatrice di firenze   showReview(19937785, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 9, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR922354864", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kassiopea82"}, {"Content": "Ottimo Bed and breakfast consigliatissimo   showReview(19065723, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 18, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR468386545", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "84MarF88"}, {"Content": "A razon calidad precio esta muy...   showReview(17602017, 'full');", "Date": "Jun 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR535018206", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "Romanticissimo!!!   showReview(11978059, 'full');", "Date": "Dec 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR591371415", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "frascati_franco"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d671319-r17773244-Relais_Dante_e_Beatrice-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "671319", "Price": "$84"}}
