It was within walking distance of two subway stations - and a shopping area at the foot of the street. You can walk to two museums and the banks of the River Spree in 10 minutes. The staff were very kind and helpful to me, a non-German speaker and the breakfast in the dining room was delicious. The bedroom was charming and the bathroom facilities great, including complimentary toileteries.

The breakfasts had a large selection of food and fruit that was presented in pleasant surroundings.

The hotel itself is in a quiet street. Although my room faced the street, on the ground floor, I didn't have any noise problem at all. However, the sheets were more than just \"gently used.\" So all night long, I felt rather uncomfortable. The internet was also VERY slow, and in room DSL was an extra cost so don't plan to browse the web there, if you are not willing to spend 10Euro for in-room connection. Breakfast was around 15 Euro...you are better off getting food outside.

When I started looking for a hotel, I had trouble finding one for the whole week that seemed OK . Using the Berlin Tourist agency website, this hotel came up as available and I booked it. What a great find! It's exactly the kind of hotel I love. Small -about 50 rooms, individually owned and with character. I had a single room, and it was small but immaculately clean and comfortable. While the building itself is old, it's obviously been renovated recently. The room was so quiet! Even though it was cool outside, the room was comfortable all the time. I loved the location - very close to all the major attractions but in a residential neighborhood. The best part was it's proximity to three major mass transit stations. The nearest subway was about 100 meters from the front door. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only negative is that there are not too many restaurants close to the hotel. I enjoyed the two nearby though, but I think you might have to speak German.", "Date": "March 15, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "USA", "Title": "\u201ca lovely hotel\u201d", "Author": "Miolaran", "ReviewID": "UR5616643", "Content": "this is a lovely small hotel with very pretty rooms and a pleasant, helpful staff; we had two rooms, both a nice size, bathrooms very clean (the shower stalls were sort of small, but otherwise fine).

The location was 200 meters from the U-bahn and safe to walk any time of night, unlike other areas in old east Berlin like the Alexander Platz.
