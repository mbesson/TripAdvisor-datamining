{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not near centre but still more smog than air. Been here three times for total of ten days September/October. It is not very near subway (About 2.5 km) and bus and taxi service too slow to use (Tian. Square about 15 km away but took an hour during late morning). Very close to 3rd Ring Road so smog starts about 6 AM till 10.30 then 3.30 PM to 7.00. Rooms were clean, although Chinese idea of bath not the same as Western equiv. (unless you are about one metre tall). Had to change room during middle of night due to power failure but was thrown out of new room at 6.50 AM even though power had not been restored to original room.Food OK although not happy with having to pay 32 Yuan (About $4) for a litre of distilled water with meal (Beijing water comes from bore holes which are 98% poluted so tap water out of question for most people).Bit annoyed that could often not find staff who could speak any European language (ie when cash machine failed to pay out / power failure/ asking for luggage to be kept in storage for several nights) even though advertised as international hotel.Not end of world if you end up here (Most Chinese hotels we went to were far worse), and many staff were friendly.", "Date": "Oct 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR214023852", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Bis+Chris"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d584055-r5906590-Beijing_Yanshan_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "584055", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
