There is also a nice shopping mall directly opposite the hotel, which is right by the metro station with many cafes and International fast food chains. The location of the hotel was perfect for us, but the room we stayed in was very basic, with an old TV set and only 5 or 6 spanish channels. The beds were like Ambulance stretchers, or the types of beds you see in hospitals, very hard, small and uncomfortable. The hotel is clean and somewhat modern with the typical understated Madridian elegance. We had a triple room with no amenities at all and it wasn't big enough for 3 people. Bathroom was a bit small but not unbearabley so. There are modern elevators in the hotel and surprising enough, it was always working unlike other spanish hotels. The hotel staff were little bit friendly but seemed more geared towards SPANISH SPEAKING business travellers. They will be pleased to help you with your directions but try not to bother them at peak times i.e. early morning and early evening as I saw a couple of them get a bit snappy with over-demanding English speaking tourists who didn't know how to fend for themselves. If you are visiting Madrid, the Cable Car is well worth a visit as well as El Retiro Park and Sol. Traveling by the Metro underground is very cheap at 1 euro per trip and its very easy to navigate. Madrid is a very expensive city, dinners at Mcdonalds, KFC, Burger King etc would cost just under 10 pounds for a regular meal. Cost of soft drinks cost around \u00a31.20 and in tourist areas, the cost goes up by around 2 pounds (DAY LIGHT ROBBERY).

The weather at this time was dry all week but cold at nights. (still not as cold as scotland so was a nice surprise) Good location from the airport, on the metro take line 8 and get off at Nuevos Ministerios and then take line 10 and get off at Principe Pio. You can see the hotel from this stop and is across the road. (the metro is only 1 euro to get there but you can buy a \"10 journey ticket\" which is 9 euros and can be used by more than one person, as you can pass it back to your partner too). On arrival, hotel reception was huge and only took few minutes to checked in. The staff were pleasant enough however answered in spanish mainly. We were taken to our room which was just the normal standard room. Was clean , tidy and spacious. Room had bath and shower. After being in the room about 2 hours the noise from the room above was horendous. We complained to staff and they spoke with the people involved who turned out to be children on a school trip. This did not work and the noise continued, this was around midnight. We complained again and were told by a certain member of staff who was very unpleasant and unhelpful that there was nothing they could do unless we wanted to go speak to the teachers and children ourselves or move hotels as all the rooms were full. With persistance and speaking to another member of staff, they then decided to give us an upgrade and we ended up on the top floor, room with a balcony, which was perfect. The bed was comfortable however was 2 beds pushed together instead of a double. The room was made up every day even though some days we had long lies. We did not have the breakfast from the hotel as supermarket across the road was better value for money. The hotel also had a lounge, internet access (not free), hairdressers and a small shop for souveneirs which was nice. Across the road from the hotel is a large shopping centre Principe Pio which has all the usual eating places mcdonalds, kfc and burger king. There is also a 24 hr supermarket and a cinema within. The hotel is within walking distance to Gran Via (about 10min walk uphills) which is the main drag in Madrid however you can also get the metro. During our time there, we visited the Bernabeu stadium (can get there by metro or by tour bus - costs 16 euros for 1 adult - unguided tour), athletico madrid stadium - calderon, (had to reach by foot which was a very long walk), hard rock cafe (walk or metro), madrid vision bus tour which has 2 lines (can buy tickets from hotel or at any small kiosks -costs 17 euros for 1 adult for 1 day, or 21 euros for 1 adult for 2 days). There were places that we didnt visit due to time and some places were closed this time of year but looked excellent. Muy Cerca De ti - which is a zoo/aquarium. Parque de attracciones -theme park which is only open at weekends at this time of year. Parque Warner - warner brothers theme park. Loads of museums, food places, churches, real palace (across from hotel) and bull fighting (only from march - october). The only downside to this holiday was that most people only spoke to us in spanish but it wasnt really a problem as there was always a way to communicate.

Classed as a 4 star hotel but probably closer to a 3 star. On our arrival we found the check in was very quick and efficient considering that we had a group of 18 and of course it didn't take us long to make our way to the hotel bar. Drinks were reasonably priced considering Madrid is generally an expensive place - around 2 euros for a small glass of beer. There are several tapas bars within 200 metres of the hotel which we found very friendly and once again quite reasonable in price. We were all placed in rooms on the same floor which helped with keeping the group together and i found the rooms to be very comfortable and well air conditioned. The only downside was that the bathroom was a bit dated, but it was functional. The location of this hotel is good - only takes about 10 mins on foot to get to the royal palace from here. The 'Sol' area where many bars and restaurants are is within 20mins and directly across the road from the hotel is the 'Principe Pio' metro station which houses a shopping centre and has direct links by underground to many of the places of interest in Madrid. The line goes straight through to the 'Santiago bernabeau' which is a good value for money trip. It cost us 15 euros each to do the stadium tour and gives you access to the museum, trophy room, dug outs and even the changing rooms. An open top bus is also a good idea - we picked one up from outside the royal palace and it cost 17 euros for unlimited use on that day - You get a guide book and earphones for the audio system and it will take you past many of Madrids places of interest. We all had a great time and would recommend Madrid to anyone - The only downside was the breakfast at our hotel which was poor. Due to the nature of our trip not many of our group made it for breakfast on the first day as we had been up over 24 hours, but on the 2nd morning we realised hat we hadn't missed much. There didn't seem to be a great deal of choice other than scrambled eggs which were watery and some franfurters that were equally as watery. All in all it was a great trip and generally i would say that this hotel is good value for money and I think you would pay quite a bit more for a similar quality hotel on the 'Gran Via'", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGood Location but STINKY\u201d", "Author": "cruss12", "ReviewID": "UR83717978", "Content": "This hotel had a great location right across the street from a metro stop and walking distance to Campo Del Moro, Palacio Real and the Cathedral.

There are many groups that stay here so be prepared to be bothered by huge groups sitting in the lobby, halls, common areas, and such. We were playing chess in the lobby and a smoking hobo runs in screaming in Spanish and stole a wallet that was on the table.

When wee told the management they were mostly indifferent and only said that they would call the police but it wouldn't do much good. The doors to the rooms in this hotel do not close and lock automatically. This is a serious security issue. There was a drunk French guy that wandered in someone's room and tried to get in the bed with someone on our tour. They were both very freaked out and the man proceeded to run out of the room and urinate in the hall. This was an extremely scary event that could be easily avoided.

If one is looking for a botanical experience in their hotel.. the Florida Norte would be it. The receptionist Antonio Gilabert was rude, uncaring and intolerant and last but not least the breakfast was something to be experienced in the manner of runny and watery eggs, old stale meats, hard bread and cola cao( hot chocolate) had to be requested. However, when i did ask for them .. the guy was very nice and polite. Yes, It is almost ok location wise... as restaurants and a lovely mall is right opposite the hotel. It is 25 mins to the Royal Palace and Gran via is not too far. There are telephone booths in the lobby of the hotel for those who cannot use the telephones in their rooms and the shopping is not too bad.. also it is a quick ride to the airport.

On arrival we were given smoking rooms. When we pointed out the error, the non-too cheerful man behind reception told us that you get what you ask for so we should have specified non-smoking rooms. On checking the papers relating to our booking he could see clearly that we had asked for non-smoking rooms. No apology was offered. Instead we were told the hotel was full so we should ask again the following day if we wanted our rooms changed. In the event, this was not necessary as the rooms did not smell of smoke but it was not exactly a welcoming experience. The hotel is located a fair bit outside the centre of Madrid (on the wrong side of the Royal Palace) so it's a good walk to get to where you want to go. There is, however, a very efficient metro shuttle service between the station directly opposite the hotel and the Opera Metro station which is a good starting point in the old centre of Madrid. There is currently a lot of construction work taking place at the front and back of the hotel but these works did not extend into the evening or night and were not a problem. The hotel rooms were pleasant enough and reasonably sized, though a bit dated, but the bathroom fittings had certainly seen better days. We had, amongst us, at least two cracked and one leaking sink and, in my room, the pink toilet cistern had been broken more than once and had been cemented together again where it sat slumped forlornly against the wall. Each operation of the flush caused the lid to leap up alarmingly. Breakfast was OK but the orange juice tasted strange. The coffee, dispensed from a machine, was literally undrinkable so we all reverted to tea. The range of food available for breakfast was not what you would expect from a four star, for example, there was no fresh fruit and even the fruit salad was tinned. The bar area was located in the cafeteria and was fine. However, it closed at 11:45 promptly each night and was no longer available to anybody including residents. To be fair, it did say that these were the opening times but it did come as a bit of a shock, nonetheless, that the bar in a four star hotel closed so early.", "Date": "April 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "marbella", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing hotel but great location\u201d", "Author": "icekween", "ReviewID": "UR7189145", "Content": "We booked this hotel at the last minute and we got what seemed to be a great deal.

We had the breakfast buffet which was very average and whatever you do make sure you finish well before the 10.30am closing time because on the first day they took everything away whilst most people were still eating so if you think you can slope in a 10.25 am (like a poor unfortanate couple did) then think again! Very poor service in my opion - especially as this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel. Its one redeeming quality though was the location - opposite a main station/metro and a revamped shopping centre and cinema and a decent walk into Gran Via. So all in all - certainly does not merit its star rating but if you manage to get a cheap room and are not put off by the huge groups of students that seemed be checking in every day, mean staff, outdated decor and just want a good base to travel around town then maybe this is for you!
