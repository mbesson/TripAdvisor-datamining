The place was completely satisfactory. I stayed there with a high school student group (of 22 people) for five nights. The rooms were tidy (no blood stains in the bed sheets), the bathrooms, albeit being small, were in excellent condition (no hairs). And who cares if the bathroom doors look like wardrobe doors as long as there are bathrooms in the rooms! Service at the reception desk wasn't overly eagerly but polite and prompt nonetheless. The breakfast was definitely of good value (once again compared to the price we were paying). It is irreplaceable if you can eat as much as you want (toast with jam) and drink as much as you want (orange juice, coffee or tea) and pay nothing extra. Keeping in mind the excellent location (just a few minutes\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 walk from the Bayswater tube station, but anyway off the main road) and the excellent value for little money, I would definitely recommend the place for groups and friends.

This was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my travelling life. We were to arrive at the hotel very late at night (1am) so I emailed the hotel the day before informing them of this. When we arrived, the extremely unfriendly receptionist told us that they didn't have our booking and wasn't even aware of the email that I had sent. I stood at the counter, booking confirmation in hand, repeatedly asking the receptionist to check again while my wife started to cry. After about 15 minutes, I started to lose my cool (something I rarely do) and I actually leaned over the counter to look at the reservation list. My name and reservation detalis were written right there on the front page. Without any apology whatsoever, we were checked in and made our way to the lift to be greeted by a big \"Out of Order\" notice. When I asked the receptionist if there was another lift, he denyed that it was out of order, so we tried it anyway. Sure enough it didn't work. Following this, we were told that it WAS out of order and that there was no other lift, however, he assured us that it would be working in the morning. I then proceded to lug 65kg of luggage up 5 floors of the most steep and narrow stairs I have ever seen. Not once were we offered any assistance or an apology for the broken lift. And then, the room. What a major disappointment. I knew there wouldn't be any air conditioning but I wasn't expecting a slum. I live in Japan so I'm pretty used to cramped spaces but this room had NO room. The only place you can open a suitcase is on the bed. And it was old. I don't mean charmingly old. Just old. Worn down carpet, chipped toilet seat and tiny tiny shower. Just standing in this room made us feel dirty. My wife tried to call her mother but the phone didn't work. I went down to inform the receptionist of the problem and he told us that all guest room phones are currently out of service. However, I have a feeling he was lying about the \"currently\" part. Next, we found that the toilet didn't flush and both my wife and I were dreading the next four days in London. We decided to stay one night and find another hotel the next day. Despite being on a budget, hence the Wedgewood reservation, we knew that the rest of our stay would be absolutely miserable at this hotel. So we spent the next morning searching for hotels at an internet cafe and making calls (from a public phone!) and eventually found something. We went back to the hotel to tell them we were checking out and asked for a refund for the nights we hadn't stayed as the hotel was nothing like the website describes. At first they refused saying that the lift, telephone etc. were not their fault (I still don't know if that means they were OUR fault), but fortunately I timed my numerous complaints just as two new guests walked in. They agreed to refund two nights. We came back to the Wedgewood after we had checked in to the new hotel that evening to pick up our suitcases and noticed that the elevator was still out of order. We learned a very valuable lesson. Don't be too tight with your holiday accommodation budget.
