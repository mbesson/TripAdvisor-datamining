{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Unreliable I was planning my wedding last september in Toluca, Mexico, and I needed a few rooms to accomodate guests from outside mexico. I emailed the Sales manager of the hotel to request a group fare, and a possible discount, and different packages.... I guess my 5 to 10 rooms for 5 days, 2500 to 5000 dollars business was not enough becuase I never got an answer back... Too bad, Holiday Inn and Quinta del Rey hotels, 100 meters down the road got the business and were really happy about it. And we were happy with their service too....", "Date": "Sep 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR778524441", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bororin"}, {"Content": "A really nice hotel in Toluca I was in Toluca for a few days for business, visiting a supplier in the nearby Industrial Park. The Crowne Plaza was really nice - during check in they applied for a Priority Club card for me, the room was extremely spacious and had a large TV, minibar, work area and another table with chairs (to eat at?). I had breakfast, and it was fine and inexpensive. Considering its location on the highway, I was surprised that the room was not noisy at all. I would stay there again.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR130637410", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Arie90435"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g150800-d248806-r3913829-Crowne_Plaza_Toluca_Lancaster-Mexico_City_Central_Mexico_and_Gulf_Coast.html", "HotelID": "248806", "Price": "$169"}}
