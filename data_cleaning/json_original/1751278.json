Hotel Brexton is on the Nation Historic Registry and has been lovingly restored. The property is conveniently located in a lovely section of Mount Vernon and a FREE bus service to the Inner Harbor is right around the corner. You never have to use your car during your stay because you can walk to most museums and attractions or take free bus and water taxis! Our room was lovely, beds super comfy and everything was extremely clean. Free breakfast daily and coffee was available 24/7. Milton and Eboni are true gems in the industry. They recommended several places to try for dinner and each was spectacular. Milton even arranged car service to Supanos and the owner of the restaurant picked us up! We were so pleased that we decided to extend our stay!

He offered to try and I obliged and Paul parallel parked my car into that space pefectly. He carried my bag in assisted with my checkin and even carried my bag to my room. Now that is service!! I was impressed! The room was on the lobby floor and just lovely. It was in the corner so my bathroom was round with very high ceilings. Very comfortable room with lovely amenties. Continental Breakfast in lower lobby in the AM - very nice. The only downside is that they have few parking spaces and when they are gone - they are gone.

The breakfast was actually quite fantastic - lots of different kinds of cereal and oatmeal, as well as varieties of coffee/hot chocolate and really delicious croissants. As part of our deal, we had a spa deal and dinner deal and all went really fantastically. We were only there for one night but really enjoyed it and recommend it.

We arrived at the hotel on Saturday at 7 P.M. When we arrived at the hotel the girl at the desk said \"I may have good news for you, or I may have bad news for you.\" She then proceeded to tell me that our two rooms were unavailable, and we were being sent to a hotel approximately 20 city blocks away in another section of Baltimore. She stated that parking would be provided at this new hotel. NEVER ONCE did ANYONE from the Brexton Hotel call us and tell us that there was a problem with our room. They even stated that \"WE DIDN'T HAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER.\" This was a lie because I made the reservation via phone. When we arrived at our new hotel we were told that the parking was NOT free, and instead we would have to pay 24 dollars per car per night. I called the Brexton Hotel because the package I bought with the Brexton Hotel provided FREE PARKING. When I called the Brexton Hotel they told me the manager PAUL would call me back and take care of it. (IT HAS BEEN 5 days now and PAUL has never returned any of my 6 phone calls) As a result of the fact that NOBODY at the Brexton Hotel told us that our room was no longer available, and the fact that the hotel we were placed in was in another section of Baltimore, we missed out on our dinner reservations on Saturday Night. Furthermore, we booked the Brexton Hotel with guests, and now we incurred approximately 100 dollars worth of taxi fees so that we could reunite with our group and experience Baltimore with them. I have tried to register my complaint with Paul, the manager of the Hotel Brexton Hotel, six different times; however he has yet to return my phone call. We are very disappointed that the Brexton Hotel Hotel has never once called us to apologize for this inconvenience, called us back to discuss this, offered to pay for the FREE PARKING that I had purchased through the online package that was offered, or even had the professionalism to call us ahead of time to tell us that our room was no longer available.

It's my fault that we selected this hotel, but I'm shocked that this is #2 in Baltimore. I can do research all that I want. I don't blame anyone at the hotel, but this place is in a rather seedy area of Baltimore. The impression that is given is that it's accessible to the harbor via the free bus that goes north and south. Well, that's fine and dandy, but it's not that convenient, and I'm pretty sure that there are people that just ride the thing because they don't have anything else to do. I figured that it was in Mount Vernon, an area which we definitely enjoyed. We had a great time at the Walters, and the neat shops near the square. This hotel isn't in the heart of Mount Vernon, and even then, you're far removed from the Inner Harbor. Parking is a bear here as well. The place is a remodeled historical site in Baltimore, and the rooms are relatively new. I would have expected for there to be more character though. I wasn't overly impressed with the size, but I guess that's what you get with an old building. Breakfast wasn't anything spectacular, but it did the trick for us. Staff was alright, nothing special of note though. I don't want to cheapen anything else with this review, but these things weren't the worst of it. Don't stray too far from the hotel at night. I'm not saying that I feared for my life, but we saw some weird things, some of which I'd rather not even mention. Let's just say that I wouldn't walk with my children again. It made us a little weary to close our eyes at night. Do yourself a favor, and check out a hotel closer to the water. We stayed at the Hotel Monaco for the rest of our stay, and while not an ideal location either, it was night and day compared to the location of the Brexton.

The parking situation is not desirable. There are several free spots right out front if you are lucky enough to get one.

However, the \"block\" turned into many blocks, and soon I found myself completely turned around and unable to find my way back to the hotel. I called the hotel and spoke to Melody, the Assistant Manager, who was so incredibly patient and helpful. She stayed on the phone with me for at least 10 minutes, talking me through how to get back, and pausing with me while I waited in traffic, at stoplights, etc. Once she successfully guided me back to the hotel, the Manager came out to flag me down, move a parked car so I could take the spot, got my suitcase out of the trunk and carried it in, and held an umbrella for me, since it was pouring down rain. Wow! The next night, when I called Melody at the front desk asking for recommendations for seafood, she found an amazing restaurant for me that even offered a complimentary limo! I could have driven, obviously, but this way, I didn't have to navigate to the restaurant, find a parking space, for pay for a valet. What a treat!

It's very clean and modern inside, while quaint and charming on the outside.

I called to cancel my reservation to which they informed me that online reservations can not be cancelled. Why? It didn't make any sense to me. Making the reservation cost them nothing. They wouldn't budge. Clearly, they think they needed my $127.04 more than I do...and for no service whatsoever. I challeneged the amount with my credit card company.

Now, here we are two months later and I received a letter stating that I never contacted them (never do anything by phone I suppose) and they won't let the charge go. So, now they've collected my $127.04 for nothing. Free money to them and the consumer has to take it. With the level of evidence they need from me, I will conceed my $127.04 and look at it as a day of school, educating me to business practices such as this.

If this is #2 hotel in Baltimore, that's not very encouraging. We stayed in a king suite on the 6th floor; I was told when booking was one of the nicest rooms. Well, the room was just okay. It was clean, but pretty devoid of personality, with low ceilings and not much light. It felt like an attic. Everything (the linens, the microsuede couch) seemed relatively new, but still felt outdated, like it had been sitting the clearance bin at Marshall's for three years and finally found a home at this hotel. But, whatever. So it's not the coolest place in the world. I can live with that. What bothered me more was the service. When we arrived I walked into the bathroom and it smelled very strongly of cigarette smoke. I walked out and said nothing about it, but a few minutes later my husband commented on the same thing -- that the bathroom smelled like smoke. Upon check-in I had been given a form that was very explicit in saying that it was a smoke-free hotel and we would be charged $250 for any smoking in the room (which wasn't an issue -- we are nonsmokers and allergic to cigarette smoke), so it was mystifying that there would be any smoke in the hotel. I called down to the front desk and she said she would investigate to see if anyone was smoking in a nearby room. She offered to move us to a smaller room (I can't imagine what that would have looked like), which we declined as the smell seemed isolated to the bathroom. She also said she would \"give us\" some odor neutralizer for the problem. It seemed she was implying that I should spray down the bathroom myself, though this was never made explicit. I explained that we were leaving the hotel to grab some lunch but that she could feel free to access our room while we were gone to try to solve the problem. When we returned about an hour later, the room smelled strongly of scented fragrance spray, which is very different from \"neutralizing\" spray. Ugh. It smelled even worse than before. We quickly headed out to our next function, grateful to escape the room. Later that night we came back to our room with a bottle of wine in hand. My husband asked the front desk for a bottle opener and they said they didn't have one. At a hotel. No bottle opener. I mean, are you kidding? A wine opener would cost them less than $10. They suggested he walk over to the bar across the street and ask them to open it for us. She made it sound like this is something that they do all the time (ask guests to go across the street and have their wine bottles opened by the bar) which again begs the question: why don't they simply have bottle openers at the hotel? So, he walked over to the bar and they opened the bottle (though the bartender definitely made fun of him). It was just one the silliest, most mystifying moments of customer service idiocy we've ever experienced. As another reviewer said, the two women who worked the front desk were always pleasant and smiling but they seemed to have no problem-solving skills whatsoever. The lights are on but no one is home. So no, I do not recommend this hotel. I like boutique hotels as a rule and prefer them over chains, as they tend to have charm and a feeling of specialness, but in this instance there was none of the hoped-for charm (except for the exterior of the building, which is quite lovely), and a complete lack of any customer-service known-how.

My experience with this hotel and the fact that I see it on nearly a daily basis has prompted me to write this review. Additionally, I like to support locally owned business and I try to avoid chains whenever possible; however, I was appalled by the business practices of this hotel (particularly management). In short, we were told the price for our room for one night would be $79. When I looked at the receipt the following day at home, we had been charged $200 including tax; $79 for the room and $100 for our two dogs, $50 per dog, which was never disclosed to us when we were told that the total cost of our stay would be $79. As our apartment had flooded that night, we would not come to a hotel at 1AM planning to leave at 6:30AM to pay more for the dogs than the cost of the room itself. The full story follows: My girlfriend and I live a few blocks away from this hotel and our apartment had water leaking through the walls, so we had to get a hotel for the night until the apartment could be fixed. The Brexton was only a few blocks away, allowed pets, seemed to be reasonably priced, so we decided to give it a shot. The woman at the front desk was very nice and gave us a slightly discounted room because we were checking in after 1AM when our apartment got flooded. We had our two dogs with us (a chihuahua and a lab) and the hotel reassured us that the dogs were welcome and our nightly rate would be $79. That sounded fine, we handed over the credit card, and we took the room. The room was clean and looked fine, but even at 1AM on a weeknight, we could hear every single sound in the hotel and out on the street. That was irritating at the time, but not that important in the grand scheme of things. In the morning when we checked out at 6:30AM, we were handed an envelope with our receipt inside and quickly left to make it to work on time. It wasn't until later in the day that we realized that we had been charged $200. Each dog had been charged $50, so we had been charged $100 for the dogs. The cost of the dogs was more than the room itself. I clearly regret not looking at my receipt immediately upon checkout, but when we checked in at 1AM with the dogs and were told that the night would be $79 with no additional charges, I believed that. Again, at check-in I told that the dogs were welcome, and there was no mention of any additional charge... or the dogs being more expensive than the room itself. If we would have known that we would be charged an extra $100, we obviously wouldn't have stayed at a hotel for 5 hours when it cost more for the dogs than the room. The day of checkout, we figured we could call management and they would be reasonable and refund the $100. Initially, management understood that had we been made aware of the charges for the dogs, we would not have stayed there, and they agreed to immediately refund the $100. However, after a week, no refund had been made. We checked back with management to see when the refund was going to be made and we were informed that they had changed their mind about refunding the $100 and were only going to refund $50. This experience was extremely frustrating, since we had clearly been deceived, and we absolutely would have never stayed at the hotel if we had known about a $50/night/dog fee. On top of that, management even acknowledged that if we had we been made aware of the outrageous pet fees, we would have gone elsewhere. Then for management to agree to fully refund the extra charges, and then to have a change of heart and still charge nearly twice the cost of the room itself when we were only in the hotel for 5 hours? I'm thoroughly disgusted with the hotel management and even the notion of charging $50/night per dog. I think that policy in itself is designed as a scam, as that is such an outrageously unreasonable charge. I always considered writing a review about this experience and I just happened to walk by the hotel today while walking the dogs and for whatever reason, I just felt the need to write about this.

I am hoping that the two very young women who covered the front desk for most of our stay were there because management decided to take a weekend off. If not, I don't think this hotel will hold on to such high ratings. They simply seemed clueless as to how to help us with anything that came up. Friendly, courteous, and always with a smile, but absolutely no thinking going on. For instance, we saw on the website that we could request a fridge. We called ahead. We were told that availability was not a problem, but the charge was not known. Fine. Upon arrival, the charge was $20/night which seemed ridiculous, but we had already bought perishables, so we asked that one be brought to the room. Twenty minutes later, no fridge. We asked again at the front desk. They couldn't find it, but would look through the rooms. What they brought was dirty with someone's abandoned freezer pop and some fuzzy black mold. We cleaned it, and plugged it in. I realize now we should have just started complaining more vigorously, or just left. But we thought that a grown-up would certainly show up and straighten us out. Anyway, it is a new hotel and the bed was alright. By the second night we realized the fridge was not working (our milk spoiled). By then we also realized that we were located on the more noisy first floor--even though the hotel didn't seem very full; we had been shown the utility stairs to go down to the continental breakfast--even though that is where the smelly garbage is stored, housekeeping skipped our room--and no one even said \"sorry\" when we went to see why (just \"that should not have happened\"), and a few other things of this sort. Small things that didn't seem worth complaining about, but we were still thinking a grown-up or manager type person would show up. Everyone who worked the front desk was pleasant, but none of them seemed to be able to think for themselves. It was very strange. We listed our complaints at checkout, and they said the charge for the fridge would be taken off our bill. I am on the fence as to whether I would go back. I thought the neighborhood was great, the room was fine for the rate charged. And, as I mentioned, we never complained vigorously--it seemed like we were dealing with inexperienced people who had no authority to help us, anyway. It is possible we read the situation wrong, and if one of those people really did have the authority to: get us a better fridge, bring back housekeeping, understand why they should be sorry, etc.--well I am sorry.", "Date": "September 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington, DC", "Title": "\u201cGreat little hotel for visiting the Real Baltimore\u201d", "Author": "Skidrowe3", "ReviewID": "UR78634271", "Content": "The Brexton is a quirky little hotel, in Baltimore's quirky Mount Vernon area. The area has a strange mix of mostly-restored 19th century Victoriana (the Brexton itself being a premier example), 1970's urban renewal (like the Waxter Senior Center across from the Brexton, or the nearby Myerson Symphony Hall), and modern automobile-oriented uses (parking lots, parking garages, and repair garages). It's convenient to a lot of things. One thing it is not especially convenient to is the Inner Harbor and the convention center. The 15- to 20-minute walk down to these areas is reasonably pleasant, but the \"10 blocks\" advertised on the Brexton's website is optimistic at best. Unless you are in Baltimore for a convention, or you're particulary fond of the Inner Harbor, though, the distance is no big loss. Mount Vernon has mostly local places--some classically gritty, some classy; some that have been around for eons, others which are new and trendy: bars, restaurants, cultural attractions like the Walters Art Gallery and the Myerson Symphony Hall, educational institutions like the venerable Peabody Conservatory and the hip MICA art college. Mount Vernon has lots of nightlife (notably gay bars, but we also noted a high-end African-American place and many straight drinkeries also), and it's also adjacent to Penn Station (Amtrak). In contrast, the Inner Harbor/convention center area, although pleasant, vibrant, and very walkable, is much less local in character, an invasion of chain restaurants & hotels. The Brexton hotel itself is essentially new, a gut-renovation. The rooms are quietly stylish, within the constraints of a medium-budget Pottery Barn/Crate & Barrel kind of style. My room (#301) and, I think, most of the others, was oddly configured, but spacious, and the furniture laid out well. Interior acoustic separation seemed excellent: I for one did not hear anyone above or adjacent. In contrast, exterior acoustic separation (i.e. the windows) did not seem very good, but then there wasn't a lot of noise to block. The buffet breakfast isn't lavish, but it had all the ingredients I personally want: fresh fruit, cold cereal, pastries, milk, juices, coffee. The coffee, incidentally, is available 24/7, which includes cappucino, mocchiato, latte, etc. Speaking of nourishment, the front desk has free bite-sized candy bars, a touch I really appreciated when I arrived, hungry. The hotel provides a limited number of free parking spaces. This was great for us, since we drove to Baltimore and were visiting family in northern Baltimore City. If you're visiting the main Baltimore attractions--the various museums, restaurants, and entertainments of the Inner Harbor, Little Italy, Fells Point, Federal Hill, Fort McHenry, and Mount Vernon--you'll do well on foot with occasional taxi (water- or standard-) ride. But a car is very useful to take in many others, such as the Poe House, Baltimore Zoo, Johns Hopkins University, the neighborhood of Hampden, or the Baltimore Museum of Art. Baltimore's public transit isn't especially good, and in any case it hasn't been embraced by the middle classes as a means of getting around. My one complaint about the Brexton is that, using floor stop wedges, they keep the doors to the main stair open. The stair is a marvellous spiral, I grant them, a pleasure to view and climb, but there are sound reasons why the law (i.e. fire codes and building codes) require stairs to be separated. I actually removed the wedge and let the door close on our floor before retiring for the night, but it had been reopened by morning. \"Service,\" I suppose, doing as they were told, ignorant of the legal implications.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delaware", "Title": "\u201cOne of a kind hotel\u201d", "Author": "njoku", "ReviewID": "UR77896296", "Content": "Tomorrow, I shall be staying at the Brexton for the fifth time, two times with family and two times solo.

We were greeted by a very friendly front desk staff, including the hotel's General Manager, Mr. PauL Masai. The guestrooms were large, well appointed, and very clean. The bed, pillows, and linens were great and my client reported having a good night's sleep, as did I. The complementary continental breakfast in the morning was limited but satisfactory. Great hi-tech cappucino and coffee machine! We ate dinner at Sammy's Tratoria approximately four short blocks from the hotel. Excellent Italian food and decadent bread pudding is a must.

The A/C in the room was very effective, and not too loud. The complimentary breakfast was just what we needed, simple yet satisfying, and the coffee maker is to die for, all kinds of coffees at the push of a button.

Vernon area \"at the last minute\" to attend a wedding. The reception was at the Peabody Library and the \"Court\" was full. When I asked if they had a recommendation for a nice place nearby they suggested the Brexton. I booked it without looking it up on TripAdvisor on the strength of the referral and the VERY PLEASANT greeting that I was given on the phone by \"Paul.\" Paul offered me a discount better than one available as an AAA member, AARP, etc. When I later checked it out on this site, I saw that it was then #2 out of 71 hotels. I generally have found TripAdvisor reviews to be sound and reliable. I was not disappointed with booking a room at the Brexton. Paul answered questions in advance and kindly said that our room would be ready for an early check-in. It was! The room was a handsome, freshly updated space with the nice bones of an old hotel. Our room on the 3rd floor had high ceilings and a nice bath with a shower. We had a queen size bed with a nice pillow-top mattress, comfy pillows, a nice sofa, desk and flat-screen TV. There was a nice, framed full-length mirror. The only negatives were no safe in the room and there was an unfortunate stain or spot on the carpet that was otherwise clearly quite new and still in very condition. There is no fitness center, etc., but if you are looking for a place with ambiance and charm, the Brexton has it. While we never met \"Paul,\" the rotating shift of folks at the front desk were uniformly friendly & gracious. The free continental breakfast is certainly adequate. Fresh bananas, yogurt and a very nice coffee machine that allows you to choose your preferred brew are nice to have so handy. If the weather had been nicer one could have eaten on a pleasant patio. Parking is limited, maybe no more than 10 or so spaces. (There are only 29 rooms in the hotel.) As we arrived early, we luckily snagged one.

I often fly from coast to coast and stay at numerous hotels....usually Marriots and Hiltons, but I thought I would take a chance on a local, rennovated hotel such as Hotel Brexton. The room and bathroom was extremely small and didn't look at all like the photographs on the website. The insulation is terrible.....so bad...that I heard every move that every guest made all through the night and didn't get any sleep. I woke up the next morning and couldn't take a shower because I had no water. When I called the front desk they told me to wait a while because other guests are probably showering at the same time preventing me from getting any water pressure. WHAT!!!! Then I contacted the front desk to get a cab and instead of a cab she said they use a contracted driver for their guests at a nominal fee. I reluctantly agreed and told her that I needed to be in a car within 20 minutes to make an appointment. The driver came almost 45 minutes later, making me late for my appointment. After leaving the hotel, I realized that I had left my phone charger in the room plugged in the wall. I called the front desk to request that they mail it and they said there was no charger in the room. After numerous calls to them asking that they check again, I received a call back 2 days later saying they did find the charger in the wall and that they would mail it. 1 week and 1 day goes by and I get an email from Hotel Brexton saying I needed to call Office Depot and pay for the shipping costs. I call Office Depot and they have no idea what I am talking about. I call back to the hotel and speak with Manager Paul Masay and he says that if I don't pay for the shipping costs they won't ship my phone charger. What a complete nightmare!!!!
