The room was small but well equipped, though if this had been a real business trip - with need for lot of computer work - I might have longed for a real desk chair instead of the footstool type thing. The comfy chair by the window also really wasn't very comfy. The bed was nice, though, with a firm mattress, which I like. Bathroom and shower good, too, but I dislike the (German?) habit of putting the sink and mirror outside the batroom. What the ... is that about? Internet access was not blazing fast, but free in lobby or 5 Euro for 24 hours in room, which isn't too bad. Didn't try breakfast, but had ok coffee in lobby.

We were put in a room with a double bed when we had booked a twin, so they happily changed us to a twin room that was much better too. The floor we moved to was being renovated so I think the rooms will be a lot better when that's all done, as the first room wasn't as nice as the one we ended up with. Free wifi in the lobby, but if you pay 7.50euro for breakfast they give you wifi in your room for 24hrs (without breakfast wifi in the room is 5euro). The breakfast was delicious!!! I loved it as it had lots of fresh and light food, my friend loved it as it had lots of pastries and cereal, we were both very happy.

We wanted to fully explore Berlin, and in particular Kreuzberg. We found this hotel to be the perfect location for what we wanted. Located at the top of Oranienstrasse, with it's many bars, restaurants and laid back vibe, (think along the lines of Camden in London, or any of the more bohemian areas of major cities) we could also walk to the River Spree and see the remainder of the Berlin Wall/EastSide gallery, the 02 World arena and we also visited the Berghain club in this area. Aside from this location, Moritzplatz U-bahn is literally outside the door so everywhere was more or less easily accessible and so visiting the major tourist sites and areas was not a problem. The hotel itself was basic, but clean and comfortable. my only gripe would be when we went to check in at 1pm, we were told it was a 3pm check in and the left luggage room was full, so we had to leave out luggage in the reception area, unsecured. I would stay here again but would probably email the hotel before arrival to request an earlier check in - none of our booking confirmation documents specified the check in time. I would recommend this hotel if you are looking to explore Kreuzberg, a very cool, pretty (almost Parisian in parts) and reasonably priced area, with a definite edgy feel.

The air conditioning only works if the outside temperature is over 21 degrees but hey, at least the window opens. Though I heard a guy at the front desk complaining because his window didn't even open. Poor man. Biggest complaint is the misleading 'free internet' - only free in the lobby. Heads up that you must pay 5 euros per day to get it in your room. Their system is further complicated by vouchers and login information that must be renewed daily, even for the free lobby Internet. All this added to the fact that the hotel is located on an unusually barren strip of Printzenstrasse, with no interesting shops, restaurants or cafes nearby, yet close to the entrance to the U-bahn Moritzplatz.

However, you may borrow the alarm clock at the reception should you need one for an early morning. Please remember that you may not borrow a soap bar from the reception! I must admit I was puzzled by the absense of a soap bar in the room but was told that since Motel One is a 2-star hotel, they do not provide soap but supply you with a complimentary shampoo only.
