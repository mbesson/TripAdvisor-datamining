As a traveler, I had just gotten to Australia and didn't have a phone or internet. I stopped at an internet cafe and booked here at this hostel. Before we got their it rained and we got lost and never made it into Sydney. We had no phone or internet and could not contact the hostel. THEY CHARGED US FOR THE STAY ANYWAY. I called the hostel to ask why we were charged 60 USD more than our deposit for a place we had never stayed. The very rude woman on the phone (whom i am sure is the owner, but she denied it) said that she was just doing ehr job and it was our responsibility to contact her. I explained to her what had happened and reminded her that we had paid a deposit. She then told me that my \"deposit was not enough and that it only paid the booking service\". WTF? You must be kidding right? I asked her wy she had not tried to email me (since I left my email with the booking) and she again rudely replied. When staying in a hostel, you book through hostel websites and pay a deposit to ensure that you are not charged when something comes up and you cannot make it in. What this place did was very wrong and I am in the process of fighting them every step of the way. To a traveler, an extra 60 dollars for a total of 75 USD for a night you didn't even stay somewhere is a lot. At this point it is not even the money. I want to make sure this trashy hostel does not ever get away with doing this ever again. If they can pull something like this imagine how unsafe your things would be there. Also, when I asked the woman if I could speak to her boss she replied, \"no you can deal with me, he doesn't need to be involved\" Well what does that tell you? Don't waste your time in a place like this.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWorst experience of my life.\u201d", "Author": "Austraveller2012", "ReviewID": "UR125420916", "Content": "We stayed in this guest house for 3 nights on arrival into Sydney.

Without exception, the staff are very helpful and friendly, taking time to find out about you and help you make the most of your stay. The free breakfast and free wifi are major bonuses (although slow connection was a pain at times). I can understand some comments about it not being a typical hostel as there were a few long-stayers there, but we weren't looking for party-central and we appreciated the (well-maintained) discipline of the communal areas being \"no noise after 10:30 at night\" (11:30 at weekends) because we wanted to get out in the morning to enjoy the City!

It's in a good location and if you want a quiet chilled out hostel, then this is a definitley a go. There are plently of bathrooms and the kitchens are clean. I wouldn't however head back here if I was just travelling, as when I stayed I seemed to be the only one who was travelling, everyone else was working, which is not a problem. However it's always different when you stay in a room with longstays. Firstly there wasn't any room for my stuff, as people are living they, understandbly they tend to take over. Secondly it means that you don't meet anyone else who has just arrived and is travelling on their own and therefore wants to go off and see the attractions. It's just a different vibe when everyone heads off at 7am for work and I did feel like I was intruding a tad. It is a nicely run hostel, but just one which is suited more for the working holiday visa peeps!", "Date": "August 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLovely and excellent stay\u201d", "Author": "lianchoo7", "ReviewID": "UR115337604", "Content": "Cambridge Lodge is clean, wonderfully maintained and in a pretty good location.

The guesthouse is about 4kms away from CBD which was perfect for us as we didn't want to stay right in the city centre.

The rooms are clean and tidy and a good size and we had a balcony which was great to sit out on when the sun shone. The bathrooms are kept clean and tidy as is the kitchen. The staff are really friendly and obviously take pride in looking after their guests and the accommodation. This is definately a notch above most other guesthouses/hostels in this price bracket.

The place is clean, the neighborhood is safe, and housekeeping/management is friendly. It is connected by bus and CityRail (Inner West Line) at Stanmore station, which is only 2 blocks away. It's also close to Newtown, where you'll find millions of Asian eateries, beer bars and crazy people. You'll find a laundry ($2 per self service) and a crowded kitchen. There is a sink and a fridge and a TV set in every room. It's not too expensive, but you can get cheaper hostels at better locations. Drawbacks: it is a cold place -- windows and doors have enormous gaps so it's actually windy in your room. In summer this may be nice but not during winter months. CityRail train (InnerWest) very convenient but only every half hour. Bus line 412 (Stanmore station) -- rather infrequent service, but connects to all major city center and Western spots and USYD as well as UTS. Rail/bus both around 20 minutes ride to city center. To get some sleep be sure to have an earplug with you. The place has thin walls. Floor, beds and toilet vents are noisy and busy night and day. However it's less busy and noisy than comparable downtown hostels.", "Date": "February 16, 2009"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cambridge Lodge Guest House", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g255060-d598006-Reviews-Cambridge_Lodge_Guest_House-Sydney_New_South_Wales.html", "Price": "$92 - $92*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">109 Cambridge Street</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Stanmore</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Sydney</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">New South Wales</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">2048</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Australia</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "598006", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/68/c9/45/cambridge-lodge.jpg"}}
