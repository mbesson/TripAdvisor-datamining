Now i'm not a very frequent traveller (just one who is Gold with IHG Priority Club), but the whole experience was pretty sub-par. Check-in was pretty quick, but the enthuasium of the staff member was that of being in-different and spoke just the minimal required (ie Credit Card and room details and that's basically it). Rooms are okay, clean as you'd expect and a big enough window to not make it feel like you are trapped inside a prison. Bit dissapointed in the room service, took about 30min to make my burger and chips, although not too fussed about that! A few things that really gets to me are; 1. Rubbish TV, if you have a widescreen TV, display the TV shows in widescreen, and make the reception quality better (and it can be done as you are getting FOXTEL digital!!!) 2. Stand out from other hotels in Australia and offer free internet, To pay $29.95 for 1000mb/24hrs is a complete joke (especially for PC Gold members) 3. Although not directly your issue, this silly $6 charged imposed by the shuttle and SACL, this is a joke! Good things: Close to Mascot station, sort of cheapish, clean and roomy.

Also the so-called \"complimentary\" shuttle is now $6 each way, for essentially a five-block run. A run you can't really make by walking unless luggage free. 2. Internet is still almost $30 a day, and still gets slowed to a crawl after only 20% of the paid-for data is used. (What other country in the world charges for data???) This is a continued ripoff of epic proportions. Cost of a monthly internet connection in Australia is roughly the same as this daily charge. 3. Televisions now replaced with cheap flat panels, but the two I saw were never set up properly, are displaying 16:9 HD pictures incorrectly so that you can't read the superimposed text or closed captions, and the signal is so bad it's a complete waste of everyone's time and money.

As well as the usual $40 meals with an additional tray charge, they have meals in the sub-$20 bracket served take away style with no tray charge. The quality of the meals I had was impeccable, and the price made them accessible with the added advantage of being convenient. This kind of well-considered service innovation is something I've never seen before, and will bring me back. The only real inconvenience at the Holiday Inn was the parking.

I didnt use the restaurant or any other facilities but aparently they have a swimming pool and a gym. At around AUS$200 for the night I'd say you are paying for the convenience more than anything else. Internet costs money to use.

However, I have always been pleasantly surprised with my stays at Holiday Inn. That is until I stayed at this one. The location is good - close proximity to the airport and a 5 minute walk to the train station. Very handy. Unfortunately, they do not have a free shuttle ($6 per person, per way) which is very odd for an airport hotel. The lobby looks good, though the corridors of the room floors are beginning to look tired and worn. The room is acceptable. Surprisingly spacious. However the bathrooms are very dated, and the extremely low flow taps and shower heads do not make bathing enjoyable. The towels in the room were in desperate need of replacement (to the point where some were so old they looked yellow compared to some of the others). The internet access is hideously expensive at this property. $10 for 2 hours or $28 for 24 hours. BOTH have ridiculous limits on data. The \"24 hour\" package has a data limit of 100 MB, which makes it very difficult to chat online with family when travelling abroad. And forget about trying to download a show or movie on iTunes for you flight home. Who has ever heard of a \"24 hour\" package with data limits? Especially limits that are that low? But the restaurant takes the cake. I stopped in for a quick bite to eat around 5pm before I had to leave the hotel to meet some people in town. They have an open air kitchen, and when I first arrived, there were about 8 people in the outlet. I ordered a sandwich and a beer. The prices were reasonable for an airport hotel, so I thought I had lucked out. Well soon, 30 mins had gone by, and my beeper that the bartender gave me to alert me when my food was done had still not gone off. I had gone into the bar twice at this point to use the restroom etc, and had noticed that the cook was no longer there (and in fact was now sitting on the patio in street clothes drinking beer). When I came back from the restroom, I asked the bartender where my sandwich was, and that I needed to go. If I had known it would take 30 mins, I would not have ordered it. She apologized and said she would try and find out where it was, and that the chef was coming from the other side of the hotel, as she motioned to the lobby. I assumed this meant that all the food orders were currently being made from another kitchen. Finally 15 mins more went by and no food. I was finally so upset that I went in to tell the bartender I no longer had time to wait. As I was walking in from the patio, the beeper went off. I looked over, and miraculously, there was another cook in the open air kitchen placing my sandwich on the pass. Unbelievable! So in other words, 1 cook was off at 5pm, and another one did not start his shift until half an hour later! At that point I simply felt lied to. I told her I did not want the meal, and that this service was unacceptable. She offered to \"box it up for me\" to go. That just made me more mad. Like I am going to eat my 45 minute long sandwich from a box as I run to my meeting. I told her I wanted a refund. I'd have thought that she would have at least comped the sandwich and my drink for the trouble, but not so much. I still paid for the drink. I was so disgusted with the service I actually got up an hour early so that I could eat breakfast somewhere else before leaving for the airport. Over all, I would NOT stay at this property again unless you are getting in late and simply sleeping a few hours before checking out.

Business users beware.\u201d", "Author": "IanWriter", "ReviewID": "UR120982346", "Content": "This hotel is one of several in Sydney that try to gouge guests with outrageous internet charges. The trick here is that your $25 dollars for a day's worth of internet in the room has a limit on its use. After a couple of hours of normal business use, you get a message that you have used too much and your speed will be slowed down unless you pay extra. Then, whether you pay extra or not, you are cut off completely if you are so bold as to transfer 1000 mb of data during your day's worth of internet usage. If you want to continue, you have to sign up for another $25 dollar's worth. It is quite possible to run up a daily internet bill of $75 + just by handling normal business files. I find this outrageous especially for a hotel that charges $300 for a room. The cheapest internet coffee shop in Sydney (or anywhere in the world, for that matter) doesn't impose limits on how much you download. This is just arrogant, unconscionable price gouging, plain and simple. I would not have stayed in this hotel had I known about this practice -- it made me feel more like a victim than a guest. I hope company comptrollers take note and instruct employees to avoid hotels that use this system. I will certainly have a word with mine. The hotel is quite inconvenient for airport use anyway, with its 2pm check in time and 11 am check out time. International travellers who commonly arrive in Sydney early in the morning may not care to cool their heels in the lobby until 2pm when their room is ready; and those with late afternoon departures may feel the same about being booted out of their rooms at 11. The shuttle from the international terminal to the hotel is very hard to find and rolls by once every half hour if you are lucky. It picks up passengers at an unmarked, unsheltered stand in the middle of the airport access road -- no fun if it is pouring rain. A better idea than being stuck here in airport nowheresville is to take a taxi or train into town, leave your luggage at one of the many pleasant hotels you can get for $100 a night less that this one, and explore some of Sydney's many attractions until your hotel lets you check in at a more reasonable hour like noon.

Airport transfers were included in our room package which made our trip really easy. Must admit though that Sydney airport is not well sign-posted and finding the shuttle bus area was a bit difficult. All in all the hotel was clean, comfortable, easy and pleasant. Very family friendly and to a good standard. I would recommend it for an airport stop-over with kids. Make sure you leave yourself plenty of time for breakfast in the morning as it was one of the nicest hotel breakfast buffets I have had in a long while!", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Australind, Australia", "Title": "\u201cComfortable for an overnight stay\u201d", "Author": "HappyTravels-7", "ReviewID": "UR118177656", "Content": "This is a hotel that you would only stay at if taking an early morning departure from the airport, or arrivie late at night.

The tones of the property are subdued and comfortable, but not as comfortable as the bed - one word AMAZING. Downstairs in the lobby there is one restaurant and one bar.

As a Holiday Inn Platinum member (315787289), I booked a standard room around a month before my overnight in Sydney. I was initially shocked at the price ($198.00 AUD / $220.00) but decided to go ahead and book at HI rather than the Mecure where I usually stay. Upon check in on July 2nd, I was not identified as being a Priority Club member (or Platinum at that), I was not offered any kind of room upgrade or bonus benefits. As I was only overnight-ing I decided not to make an issue of it. Reviewers will note the \"worst\" statement in my title so I'll outline specific issues and complaints: 1. Bath Room - The standard room (1025) had two dirty towels hung on the back of the bathroom door and streak marks in the toilet. There was also soap residue left from the previous guest in the bath tub. Disgusting. 2. Amenities - No free water was provided in the room. No welcome basket or fruit was provided. 3. Fitness - The fitness room sauna was broken. The hotel's \"swimming pool\" is nothing more than a 20 x 10 plastic tub in the ground. 4. In-Room Entertainment - The hotels room NTT Docomo entertainment and Property Management System / PMS is from the early 90's, crashed multiple times during attempts to order video services. I ended up paying $16.95 for a recent release movie but was charged an additional $19.95 for services I did not order. 5. Internet - No Platinum member complimentary Internet was provided in the room. 24 hours of access to a Connexus ~1 mbit DSL connection costs $27.50 AUD which is an absolute rip off. This is the first Holiday Inn I've stayed in which has no provided complimentary Internet to Gold and Platinum members. 6. Front Desk - I called the front desk twice during my stay, once to inquire about Internet facilities and a second time to ask about fitness facilities. Both times I spoke to reception staff they were very abrupt and seemed quick to want to end the conversation. Half of the 'Hotel Services Guide' in my room was missing, hence the reason I was calling for information. The gentlemen who answered my calls (front desk, mid-height, chubby, glasses) was quite rude directing me to the services guide rather than providing a simple answer. 7. Biggles Bar & Cafe - As I arrived after 6 pm, I decided to have dinner in the Biggles Bar on the 1st floor. I ordered a bottle of wine as well as fish and chips. I noted that the first bottle of wine I was given had already been opened (Penfolds Cabernet Sauvignon). Before even touching the bottle I politely asked the counter to change the bottle as it appeared open. She immediately began arguing with me. I kept a straigth face and said they could either change the bottle or cancel the order. Muttering under her breath, she proceeded to change the bottle out. The fish and chips were acceptable albiet a very small serving for the price. 8. Wake Up Call - I requested a wake up call for 6:30 am on the morning of my departure. As of 7:00 am none was provided. I may have missed the bus to the hotel had a customer call not come in 20 minutes before the bus left the hotel ($7.00 AUD from HI to Syd. Intl). Bottom line - don't stay at this hotel, Holiday Inn Priority Club member or not. Take your money and stay at the Mecure or Ibis. Both offer a much higher level of service, have newer facilities and far more capable staff. To Ian Pirodon (Hotel Manager) and the rest of the Holiday Inn - Sydney Airport's staff, I encourage you to address these issues with your house keeping, reception and restaurant.", "Date": "July 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nashville, TN USA", "Title": "\u201cLack of staff\u201d", "Author": "pine129", "ReviewID": "UR114791318", "Content": "I have been a regular visitor at this hotel as it is quite close to the airport.

Our Tips: 1. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a night flight and are heading back towards Europe and the Middle East ask for a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153day-use\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd room (if possible) when you check out. OK it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll cost you maybe AUD $120.00 but when you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got an 14 hour direct flight to Dubai ahead of you leaving at ten \u00e2\u20ac\u02dco\u00e2\u20ac\u2122clock at night it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s nice to arrive at the airport after having rested and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153freshened up\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd!! Airport tip: When leaving from the airport look inside for trolleys or it will cost you AUD $2.00 (per trolley) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to be pretty quick as they are quickly collected and put back into the rack outside by enthusiastic uniformed staff (so they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re easy to spot!). This is the only airport in the world that I have encountered where you need to pay for luggage trolleys \u00e2\u20ac\u201c OK you need to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pay\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd in Larnaca (Cyprus) but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s only a deposit like with shopping trolleys in Europe \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so at least you get your money back when you return it after checking in! 2. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an excellent \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Spar\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd supermarket just down the road past the train station around the corner. It has beer/wine/spirits and food of course! Gripes (only one!): 1. There is no mention on the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website of the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shuttle bus service on the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153directions\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd page where it mentions \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Transportation To and From hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. If the information is there (and I am pretty sure it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not) it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153buried\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd somewhere in some obscure part of the site. We arrived at the airport from NZ (4 of us with maybe 5x bags/suitcases) \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fit in a normal taxi so had to try to arrange for a bigger taxi. Nobody wanted to take us because of the short 5-minute drive so we ended up basically begging for lady taxi driver to take us, loaded/unloaded all our bags ourselves and were charged about AUD $40.00 for the privilege. Sadly, I was too tired and stressed out to argue even knowing at the time that it was a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rip-off\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. On our way back to the airport we used the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s shuttle (AUD $6.00/seat) and it worked fine. We now have the shuttle bus timetable for next time \u00e2\u20ac\u201c shame we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it when we arrived. The shuttle bus leaves from \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Bay 32\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and from the International Terminal and you won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to wait more than 40 minutes (The first one of the day leaves at 06:50 and the last at 23:10). These details were correct as at January 2011. A good idea might be to get the hotel to email you a copy of the latest shuttle bus timetable. Observations (Only one very minor and petty one!): Sorry but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help myself (proof reading contracts and correspondence is part of my job!) but I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but notice the signs around the hotel which state something along the lines of \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our hotel is smoke free so you can breath (sic) easier\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m no expert but am pretty sure it should read: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our hotel is smoke-free so you can breathe easier\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. (i.e. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153smoke\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153free\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should be hyphenated and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153breath\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd should have an \u00e2\u20ac\u0153e\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the end. It was unusual to notice signs in the hotel of a major hotel chain, in an English-speaking country to be spelt wrong. In conclusion: We really liked this hotel and the location and would definitely stay here again. Knowing what we know now, next time should be even less stressful and more enjoyable. Travelling with young kids is stressful enough so trust this information will be helpful to other families\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cUnprofessional service and rude personnel\u201d", "Author": "Noo36", "ReviewID": "UR102007479", "Content": "We booked and paid in advance but there was no record of our reservation on check in.

The bed and pillows were comfortable and we both managed to get a good night sleep.

The weather was pleasant and the walk was easy, although we stopped and asked for directions more than once as we had neglected to bring a map with us! The walk is straightforward enough though, walk out of the Qantas terminal, turn left and then turn left once more when you reach the Stamford. Keep walking up the left hand side of the road until you see the Holiday Inn - it's enormous and you can't miss it! I booked the most basic room directly on their site and requested an early check in and a room on the 3rd floor or above (after reading complaints about bar noise on the lower floors). Both requests were met and we were in our room by 10.15am. The room appeared to have been recently refurbished, and was completely comfortable with everything that we required for our short stay. The carpets in both the room and the corridor were in very good condition, the bathroom was very clean with sparkling white grout on all the tiled surfaces, although there was a rust spot on the bath near the plughole. We didn't notice any strange noises, the shower pressure was excellent, the bed and pillows were comfortable, the airconditioning was able to be adjusted to suit our requirements. The windows seemed to keep pretty much all the traffic and airplane noise out. We slept as well as you possibly can when you have an early morning flight to catch and you are worried about oversleeping your alarm! We walked to the nearby train station (a comfortable 5 minute walk), bought a ticket from the ticketing machine and caught a train into Circular Quay for lunch at Cafe Sydney. On arriving back at the hotel we enquired about the availability of taxis early in the morning and were advised that they need to be ordered before 6am and take approximately 15 minutes to arrive. After that time there are usually taxis waiting at the front door. We ordered our taxi as we were checking out and it arrived within 5 minutes. We ordered room service from their special take away menu that night as we couldn't be bothered leaving the room again once we had settled down on the bed in front of the television. The food was delivered in 20 minutes as promised on the menu. The food is packed into takeway containers and the delivery consisted of a staff member handing you the food complete with plastic cutlery. I had nasi goreng, which was a huge serve, piping hot and fresh, but rather bland. My husband had one of the pizzas and some garlic bread which he described as ordinary. As we hadn't been expecting anything special, we weren't disappointed. The price was comparable to buying the same meal for home delivery and all in all it met our expectations. Pretty much like the the entire hotel really. Nothing special, but exactly what we required for a one night stay before our flight the next morning.

We met my cousin in the downstairs restaurant and she was able to get a free meal along with my daughter even though I only paid for 2 adult breakfasts. They didn't really seem to care who walked in for breakfast. My wife thought they had a lot to offer for breakfast so it's important to keep the wife happy. We took the cab in from the domestic terminal as it cost us only $12. We decided to book the shuttle for $6 a head and it turned out cheaper than getting a cab as the international termianl is much further from the hotel than the domestic. So take a cab if flying into or out of the domestic terminal. Shuttle is a better to and from the internationl terminal. Overall a pleasant stay. Nothing special but comfortable.

Not sure how it works in this hotel as when I came back Monday evening from my client meetings, the room was still in the same condition as I had left it in the morning. On Tuesday though, they made up the room. I liked the pillow menu and used the feather pillow. It was also good to see that this hotel has standard items in the room that you don't have in other hotels such as a bath robe and slippers.

A big L-shaped number that was situated around a storeroom type affair, so we only had 1 neighbour.

There is nothing to differentiate between them so consequently, we had 3 people on our international shuttle who wanted the domestic & had to get off half way!

Botany Road is a ten minute walk and there are many hole-in-the-wall restaurants there that are worth walking to. Out at the airport there is nothing to do, though - no nightlife or attractions of any kind, although this property offers convenience. It was great at arrive and get to this hotel after a long flight and crash into bed, so convenience is what they offer - but the rates are too high for the level of quality and they lose me there since it makes no sense to be paying this rate . The train station is a five minute walk and it's easy to go there and jump a train to the city center. Our rate was A$100 a night, and at that rate it was ok. Their present rates are just nuts! It's also getting worn - carpets are poor, bedspreads need cleaning. The place is either getting beaten to death or simply not being refurbished/maintained.", "Date": "December 20, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brampton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cHelpfull front desk staff\u201d", "Author": "KentuckyColonel", "ReviewID": "UR8841563", "Content": "I arrived on a flight from Darwin in the early evening, checked in and needed to get to Olympic Stadium (now Telstra Stadium) straight away to see a rugby match.

The shuttle bus took quite a while before it arrived, then we had to sit through the traffic in the domestic terminal before we reached the hotel. The whole journey including wait time took 1 hour 10mins, I would get a cab instead if you decide to stay here. Check in - quick and efficient Room - The reviewer in January must have got a more modern room than myself as my room looked old and stale and was crying out for a refirbushiment. Plus side was the room was very large. Bath room - Very simple and clincally, but once again like the room needed an update, the other major negative was that the sink and the toilet had an eggy smell coming out of it, which required the bathroom door to be shut otherwise you could smell it from your bed. Not nice!
