If a couple of things did not happen during our visit, and it is purely a matter of chance that they did, then I would have given this hotel a 5 star rating. The two things that happened and the reason for the downgrade in rating is noise and smoke. The source of noise was from the room above. This hotel is old, which is major part of its allure, but the floors are very creaky. We happened to have someone above us that stayed out late - a normal thing in London, but with the floors as they are the creaking woke us up and kept us up. We are from California so we were still in the jet-lag mode so we needed our sleep. The 2nd thing that happened was one night we were woken up by the smell of cigarette smoke. A little smoke drifting into our room would be one thing but this was thick enough that if there were a smoke detector I think it would have set it off. This hotel is a non-smoking establishment but as with any place, you cannot control what people do. We called the desk and they investigated but the disruption to our sleep was done - this was at 3:30AM. So if you are lucky enough to be either deep sleepers or have no one above you and no one decides to break the no-smoking rule then this hotel is great. The staff are all very friendly, the rooms are very clean, and the hotel is in an excellent location (3 minute walk to Notting Hill Gate tube). We had a four poster bedroom and it was very spacious. It overlooked the street which was nice but you do get a little bit of street noise - but nothing that bothered us. The room was filled with antique-ish furniture making it feel a little like you are staying at your grandmothers house. So, with this hotel it is a matter of chance. It could be outstanding or it could be the hotel from you know where if your luck is not good. I think the hotel owners could make it less of a chance for those negative things to occur by doing the following: 1. Install special screws in to the wood floor to keep them from creaking. 2. Install weatherstripping on the doors that lead into the hallway to keep smoke or other odors from entering the room should they occur. 3. Remind everyone when they check in that there is strict no-smoking policy.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "Title": "\u201cA lovely surprise\u201d", "Author": "Ram C", "ReviewID": "UR126568545", "Content": "My wife and I came to London for a week in January.

(there are 2 Abbey Courts) Except for a couple of minor things I would give this hotel an exceptional rating especially for a woman visitor. one minor thing is the door to rm uses a skeleton key. No security latch inside. At night I would put my suitcase in front of door as an added precaution. the other being the cord for the tea/coffee pot was not long enough to reach the plug from the table. I had to sit it on floor to heat water. However the instant coffee was very good for an instant. and my favorite cookies as a bonus. Walkers shortbread. However the security in this hotel is great, not only do you turn your key in before leaving the hotel, the front door is kept locked 24/7 and you have to be buzzed back in. There is always someone at front desk to retrieve your key from. And everyone I dealt with was extremely pleasant. Yes, the room was small but more than adequate for my needs. During the day I put my suitcase in the closet so the maids would be able to clean room without moving my stuff around. I have no idea as to size of double rooms but a single was perfect for my stay. The breakfast was more than adequate and you are brought your own pot of coffee in a press, and after the first morning when I asked for some hot water as the coffee was a little too strong for me each morning following the attendant brought me a pot made with less coffee. The stairs down to the conservatory are a little steep but I held onto rail and stepped carefully. I would not recommend this hotel for persons with severe mobility problems primarily because of stairs and no lift. I primarily chose this hotel because it was one of the few that actually stated it had a bathtub. actually they are jacuzzi tubs, regular tubs with jets. I usually spent about 1/2 hr every night soaking. ahhh. Nice fluffy towels and washcloths. I booked through their website after a couple of emails (one guarantying me a first floor rm) and got a much better rate than booking sites. about 2 blocks from Notting Hill Gate tube stop with 3 lines. When I arrived my suitcases were taken up to my rm while I checked in and as I checked out the desk clerk asked if I needed help bringing them down. I have also notified the hotel that a couple of websites are listing amenities they do not have. I know this seems like a long review but I wanted to dispel the negative reviews, every one is entitled to their opinion but mine is this was a great hotel for the rate and my needs.

When I inquired about this at reception, the response was a puzzled look, a shake of the head, and a long \"noo...i don't know what you're talking about\". The \"jacuzzi\" baths are big enough for one, and the jets were rusty and emitted a foul stench when we turned them on. Not recommended for romance. The service was mediocre, I'd say bordering on unfriendly, and the breakfast was just your basic continental. The complimentary items in the rooms including toiletries, tea, and lukewarm bottles of mineral water, were of the cheapest variety, while the towels were rough and also smelled unpleasant .

We stayed here on the recommendation of a very hip Londoner friend of mine. PROS 1) Attractive old Victorian property with lots of old quirks, including antiques in the room, a giant front window, a shelf of books, and attractive old bath fixtures. The bathroom was tiny but was well-maintained and clean. Very comfortable bed. My girlfriend loved the jaccuzi-like jets in the bathtub--a very nice touch. 2) Good location on a quiet street in Notting Hill, very near a major underground stop (Notting Hill Gate), Kensington Palace, and Portobello antiques market. 3) Attentive service. We were arriving in the morning from the USA, so the hotel prepared a room for us to check-in early. There was a problem with billing that management resolved promptly. (If the hotel bills your credit card in US Dollars, beware that they mark-up the exchange rate by 3% and do not disclose this mark-up.) The hotel's website is very informative. AREAS TO IMPROVE 1) Conceirge service. Notting Hill is noted for its restaurants, but the hotel's front desk could only give us a list. The clerk appeared not to have ever eaten in any nearby restaurants and couldn't make an authoritative recommendation. 2) Internet. There is a computer with internet in the lobby, but the hotel charges 5 pounds/hr for it. This would be a very nice feature if management didn't try to make a few pounds off it. 3) Breakfast. It's adequate but not outstanding: a small table of juices, yogurts, fruit, cereal. Also, the negative review immediately below is bogus.

I'd booked a Deluxe Single room through hotels-london, as I'd found a rather good rate there for bed and breakfast. Although some of the reviews on this website are not that enthusiastic, I feel I have to report my extremely good impression of the hotel and recommend it to fellow travelers. Rarely have I encountered - in London or elsewhere - such caring, attentive, personal service, from members of the staff asking me how I was in the morning, to newspapers delivered every morning in a neat plastic bag hung outside the door, to the nowadays very rare turning-down service in the evening. The hotel is housed in a typical Victorian townhouse in a quiet side street of the fashionable Notting Hill area. There is no shortage of restaurants, caf\u00e9s and shops, and Portobello Market is just a short walk away. The rooms and common spaces feature antique furniture and prints, and the baths are lovely rose-veined marble, white porcelain and brass. My room had a queen-sized bed, plenty of room for my things in the wardrobe, and something I've always been very keen on - a real vanity table, complete with mirror and stool. One word of warning, though: the hotel may not be suitable for everybody, as there is no lift, and it may be a problem for some people to manage two or three flights of stairs once or twice a day, though of course the staff are only too happy to help with luggage. In short, if you look for atmosphere, relax and individuality, rather than the state-of-the-art level of comfort you can enjoy in luxury chain hotels, the Abbey Court is the hotel for you.
