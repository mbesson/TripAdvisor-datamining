I had nothing to do in the matter of picking what hotel we were at for this trip, so went in rather sceptical. You can get better hotels in London, without a doubt. And I would recommend i.e. Montana Excel over this any day of the week, but if you are in London for a weekend trip or so, and you just need a place to sleep and are not going to be hanging out in your room, this is a OK place. You share a toilet with the other guests, and the door is locked at most times downstairs, so you might have to wait until the receptionist is done on the phone to get inside, but all in all there are worse places. We were in London just to have a OK place to travel from, as we were only there for three days to check out universities for me. So we did not require a palace. This is not the place for a romantic city-trip, nor for a family vacation, but if you go by yourself or with a small group of friends and as said only need the roof over your head, you will be fine.

Yes it is not the Ritz but for the price I paid it was a perfectly acceptable hotel. First some negative points so you know what you are getting. The hotel is dated and the decor is maybe not up to everyone's standards but it was clean and functionable with no bedbugs! We were on the top floor and there are a million steps to get up there with no lift so if you have mobility issues you may want to request a lower room. The room did get very hot but a fan was provided and the windows opened wide. We had a shared toilet and shower. The shower room was tiny (wardrobe size) with no space to change so you had to go to the shower in your towel, leaving your clothes outside. Not the best for my 3yr old child to use. However with all this when I am travelling I am only using my hotel as a base so all this was perfectly liveable. Now the positives. The staff were very friendly and helpful and didn't try to sell me anything. The hotel has free internet access and a 24hr reception, they also allowed me to leave my bags in recpetion on my last day in London free of charge. There was huge amounts for breakfast served from an open kitchen so you could see how clean it was served by friendly waitresses. The location is excellent within 5mins walk of Victoria Station and the tube and buses. We also had an easy walk to Buckingham Palace, Big ben, London eye, Downing Street and Westminster. There is also two musicals - Wicked and Billy Elliot - right next to Victoria Station so 5 mins from the hotel. However the hotel is located on a quiet residential street so I found it very quiet at night time but within easy reach of late night cafes or shops. The room was small but comfortable and clean with a mini fridge, hairdrier, sink, coffee/tea facilities and a TV with 5 analogue channels.

He gave us free map of worth 2.95 for street guide.\" .\" So Me and my wife made plan for next day.\" Second thing i like that was nice breakfast. Breakfast include Fruits,Juces,cerials tea-coffee and Crossants. That's i wasn't expected. so over all i personally feel which was more than i booked. Another main point i would descrbe is location.It exctly central and safe neighbourhood. Hotel is safe due to main doors operated by recepcionist permission only. I also will give less point will be no lift in the hotel, so I have to hang up till 3rd floor. but its was not much more problem.

I arrived with my two young children from the USA and tried to check into this hotel upon my arrival at 11pm. I did know in advance that I may not be able to check in until 1pm. However after a ten hour flight and 3 hour cab journey due to bad traffic we finallly arrived at the hotel. Upon our entrance which was a struggle to fit my suitcase and two children as well as myself through the hallway. The carpet was a dingy, stained and looked like it had been taken from a closing down well used restaurant from the 1970.s. The walls were a blend of dull green with brown marks which i presume was from so many people rubbing up against them trying to squeeze through. The reception was not much bigger and behind the unfinished, unpainted hand made MDF desk was a guy who I presumed to be the owner he was pleasant although not too understanding. Please note I could not fit myself as well as my children into the reception it was about the same size as my brrom cupboad. I then found out that the toilet and separate shower were two floors away from our room. We were only staying two nights there and we only needed something basic to crash for the night. Although I did not realise basic meant, dirty, grimey, dull, dingy, smelly. stained and the most repulsive place I have ever paid to enter. But it gets worse.... I asked if we could sit and wait with our luggage until our room was ready. But was told there was nowhere we could sit as he did not have anything. I asked if we could wait in the breakfast room but was told it was locked until breakfast the next morning. (Not sure how anybody could pluck up enough courage and anti- bodies to actually eat there?) He then went on to inform me that it was not a hotel but in fact a bed and breakfast, not sure what the difference is? I asked him why it said Caswell Hotel outside the door....he told me he didn't know. So we had to leave the hotel, as we were walking out he informed me I was not allowed to take our key and we had to leave it with him at all times as keys were not permitted beyond the front entrance. So we bravely left our luggage with him and went out until 1pm as requested. We returned to find that nobody was in the hotel and we had to wait for 15 minutes in the cold and rain for him to return to open the front door for us. He did apologise and said he was busy cleaning. My daughter was desparate to use the toilet and he showed us to the toilet on the second floor....this was going to be our toilet shared by two other floors of people. The door was difficult to open and then it could not close all the way, so if you were in action anybody going to their room could quite happily see, hear or smell what you were up to. The sink was so small I did wonder how you could put both hands under the tap? There was no soap but an abundance of fully used, soiled white and brown toilet paper all over the toilet floor. The inside of the toilet and toilet seat looked like it had just been in an explosive bomb made up of people's poo from all over London but there was a very nice clean toilet brush outside of the toilet entrance in the hallway. We did not use the toilet but had a quick look at the shower which we stupidly thought may also have a toilet! The shower did not look much larger than a circumferance of a toilet roll,,,i was trying to imagine as a size 10 female how you would actually fit into it without the fear of the sticky grungy moldy shower curtain clinging to your body. We all walked downstairs (be careful here they are not very wide or straight) and I asked to check out, he told me no problem but could not give me a refund as i booked through a website....funny the website has told me only he can give me a refund! This is the kind of hotel that you would recomend to a demolishion company and to the health and safety inspectors....nobody else especially if you have children or are over a size 12 (150 pounds) as you would not fit through the hallway or reception or shower...but that would be a welcome bonus. I walked across to a hotel just 5 minutes away called the Luna Simone it was a three star for the same price and was absolutely gorgeous...please stay here instead unless you like the hammer house of horrors touch.", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cClean and basic\u201d", "Author": "Sazara", "ReviewID": "UR10164707", "Content": "The caswell is extremely dingy, needs a good paint, but if you are,like we were, just after somewhere fairly handy to put your head down for the night, its fine.

The manager had let us have a look at our room before we paid the whole sum of money. As to the room itself, it was small, but quite cosy. It looked very similar to the one shown on the photos provided by the hotel. Beds and towels were clean. The shower was rather small but we coped quite ok. We enjoyed the breakfasts in spite of the fact that there wasn't much variety. There was a good range of cereals, jams and very tasty croissants and toasts. Also, what I liked a lot, was that we had a kettle, a tea pot and tea and coffee bags in our room. Speaking about the location, it was quite convenient. It took about ten minutes to reach Victoria station and several minutes to reach a bus stop. There was a reasonably priced supermarket in the area as well.

Having stayed there for 5 nights, I feel somewhat qualified to comment, and , since I am a very forgiving and kind person, tolerant of much, I'll start with the positives. The Caswell is very conveniently located, within easy walking distance of Victoria bus and rail stations, the Pimlico Tube stop, Buckingham Palace, Parliment and the rest of the Westminster attractions, the Thames, etc. It has close-by internet cafes, laundrettes, restaurants, and other services. We felt very safe in the neighborhood, which is made up of private homes and hotels much like the Caswell - at least from the outside. The staff was very pleasant and helpful, courteous, and went out of their way to assist us whenever they could. On the negative side of the ledger - the place is a dump. The carpet is dingy and overworn, the furniture is stained and tired. When I tried to pull our desk chair out from the desk, the back of the chair came off in my hand. The rooms are small and cramped, and the walls and floors are not plumb - many items for furniture listed noticeably in one direction or another. The en-suite facilities looked to have been taken from an RV and stapled into the corner of our room. The WC was VERY small - but cleanish. It was hard to use the sink without kneeling on the commode. You couldn't move in the bathroom without bumping things, including the toilet paper holder, which routinely fell off the wall. The shower was so small that it was almost impossible to stand in it without the shower curtain clinging to you, which was kind of icky. Even though we had facilities in our room, we thought seriously about using the shower down the hall, just because it looked like you could bend over in it without clonking your head on the sink. The breakfasts at the Caswell are spartan - cereal, toast or croissants, juice and coffee or tea, but served by very charming and gracious staff, and everything in the simple breakfast room was very clean and tended to. If you are budget conscious, and only need a mostly clean bed to collapse into at the end of the day, maybe the Caswell is worth it. If anyone in your party is the slightest bit squeamish about stains and close confines, go elsewhere. There are dozens of similar hotels in the same neighborhood - I have to believe some of them are better appointed and better cared for. The net result of our experience is that we won't be going back, and won't recommend it to anyone we like.", "Date": "July 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "canada", "Title": "\u201cterrible experience\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5465529", "Content": "my sister and i reserved a double room after viewing their website. i should have checked it out before paying. we seriously contemplated staying up all night rather than sleep here.

Anyway, the girls who booked me the room were kind, and from what they said, the room sounded ok. I took a taxi to Caswell and went inside. The only nice thing about this Hotel was the young Indian boy who waited on me. The place was bad news. Dark, dirty, dreary...etc. I am an older woman who travels mostly alone, and I do not mind the majority of places I have ended up in, however, this was not going to be one of them. To start with, I would have had to walk up 4 flights to my room, which had no bathroom or telephone...both of which were important to me. My husband called every night from the States and I would lay in bed and talk. Mind you, It was 11pm in London when I arrived at this hotel. When I told the young man that I was not willing to climb the stairs (no elevator), He kindly tried to get me to go in the basement. It was a long flight of stairs also. There was a room down there with a bathroom ensuite. Witout going down I declined and left. I knew I would not get my money back. I then took a taxi to Westminster Hotel on Leinster square. I had stayed there several days before and I loved it. They took me right in...and honored a very low rate from the Internet.
