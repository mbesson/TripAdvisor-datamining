The second plus is the friendliness of the staff. It is a happy hotel; the staff get on well and this shows. We met the owner and she did all she could to please us. Couple of minor criticisms. One, the breakfast needs a little variety - I think I shall give cold, hard boiled eggs a miss for a while. Two, there was lack of information about appliances in our room - how to work the air conditioner/ heater, how to use the safe. We wasted quite a bit of time trying to work these out and got a little bit irritable.

However, this was quickly remedied by Gloria giving us the heater from the reception area, and a brand new radiator being installed the following day. It still needed tweaking but Gloria again parted with her heater! We stayed in a garden room, which was big with a fab shower - the courtyard would be a lovely place to sit on a summer's evening (but not in -5 in Feb!!). Breakfast was also lovely with a wide choice - much wider than other Italian hotels that we've stayed in - and again the staff (Cristina) were lovely too.

You can see from our map that we travel quite a bit and love Italy. This year we wanted to explore Rome with ample time and staying in Trastevere which is this wonderful residential neighborhood was the best choice of all. Le Clarisse is a wonderful hideaway in a bustling city. It is a boutique hotel with thirteen or so rooms and quite lovely. The building is an old convent that has been renovated tastefully and in great detail. It is an oasis once you enter and step into this marvelous patio, quite and peaceful. It is well worth the modest cost and if you want more room rent one of their suites as we did. The owners and staff of Le Clarisse are first rate and the service is superb. The ladies who own the place come every day to tend to \"business\" and something is always being upgraded, cleaned and changed. Quite impressive. Gloria, Giancarlo, Alexis and Mariana are the main reception/concierge staff and they are the very best. They are knowledgeable, gracious, courteous with an attitude of \"whatever you need we will do\" at all times. Cristina and the other gal who are in charge of the breakfast are fabulous!!!! The spread is terrific and every day you look forward to going and chatting with them while enjoying a great meal and a variety of cafes. We stayed in one of the suites which was spacious and so comfortable. As I read some of the reviews it was hard for me to relate because we were so comfortable in our room and had ample space. The housekeeping staff is also very good and thorough. This place is boutique hotel offering personalized service which is first rate. If you are looking for something different then do your research and zero in with your choices.

Le Clarisse was the first stop on my vacation and I must say that I loved the location and the ambiance and would certainly recommend it as a perfect base to explore Rome! The positives: > The room I stayed in - Oleandro, was in the 'new' extension and very clean, neat and quaint. > The continental breakfast was about the best laid out from all the B&Bs I stayed in during my trip and the lady in charge was very kind and helpful. > It was a nice experience to live in a more residential neighbourhood of Rome, which was still just a short distance away from the main sights and even the Vatican - rather than be stuck in the touristy areas around the station. > Public transport - buses and trams to the main sights are close at hand and easy to use. Even my transfer from the airport, which I managed by train and bus, and back to the train station was very easy. > As a single woman traveller, it did not feel unsafe to be living in this area (a couple of harmless tramps were all I did see). > Based on my experience in Italy, the price for the quality of accomodation was within a reasonable range (as my Italian friends also assured me). The not-so-good: > I had a double room for single use and strangely enough the double bed had two different single matresses - one which was very uncomfortable, but I quickly figured it out and shifted to the other side and had a restful sleep. (Unfortunately, I forgot to mention this to the staff but hopefully the problem can be easily solved). > Previous reviews have mentioned that street sounds in the 'new' wing are rather loud at night and I would agree however since I am used to living in an urban setting it was not unmanageable for me. If you are a light sleeper - ear plugs would be required. > The room was extremely comfortable in the summer with an excellent air conditioner but I suspect that the rather rustic door might allow undesirable drafts to enter the room the in the winter. Also: > I did see reviews which complained about the fact that you have to carry a bunch of keys around (to ensure that you can enter the property after hours) but for me this was just part of the experience. > They were unable to facilitate an early check in (and to be fair, did not promise it either) but you can store your luggage and lunch/ brunch at the neighbourhood restaurants/ cafe.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Richmond, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cBig Disappointment\u201d", "Author": "cspowell", "ReviewID": "UR121321503", "Content": "This hotel is very sparsely furnished and is definately a NO Frills kind of place.

Classic music in the breakfast room compensates for the small size of the premises. AREA - The street is a little away from the noisy Trastevere centre, but next to the main street with lots of public transportation, so it is still pretty dynamic. Each morning next to the hotel and along the main street cheap market place. General feeling around the hotel - quite and peaceful. LOCATION - 7 minutes to central square of Trastevere by foot. Transportation to other touristic sites on the other bank of the river is confusing and not very comfortable. Tram will not get you far away and busses have 3 different stops on the main street, so we chose walking. It is 15 minutes to Campidoglio and Foro Romano, Pantheon might be 20-30 minutes by foot. Nearest subway stop that we used - Colloseo. If you love Trastevere and its ambience, this hotel is a good choice.

Also, its prices are reasonable for what it offers. I have read some of the critical reviews some people have written recently about Relais Le Clarisse, and can only conclude that those people would have had to pay a lot more in some of Rome's pricier hotels to get what they wanted. Obviously, we agree more with the MANY positive reviews the Relais has gotten since it first opened. What one gets there are rooms that are attractive and comfortable but also spacious compared to other hotels in Rome.

The ground was dirty, the Jacuzzi, shower and toilet smelled musty. The Jacuzzi was absolutely dirty and had no stopper. Difficult to regulate the temperature of the shower.The goblets (cups) were dirty and not replaced. By the way: the hotel offers a car service to or from the airport for \u20ac 50.

No windows, just one door. \u201cThe entire environment is furnished by fabrics of natural tonalities including its queen-size bed, which is arranged in sheets of fine and delicate cotton.\u201d Sorry, but those sheets were very common and some time-worn. \u201cThe bath is roomy and modern and offers the refreshing luxury of a whirlpool tub for two people as well as a comfortable shower.\u201d Sorry, but the whirlpool had to be repaired, as we were complaining. \u201cIncluded in the bath is our special line of soaps of natural fragrances, towels of soft sponge and a hair dryer.\u201d This makes me laugh!!!

Although Rome is a great place to visit, the overwhelming onslaught of tourists 365 days a year has jaded many Roman's attitudes toward foreigners. Staying at Relais Le Clarisse where the staff is genuinely happy to have you there makes the Rome experience into a great one. On my last night, one of the staff actually spent the night at the hotel in order to be there when I left for the airport at 5:00 am the next morning. Great car service for transfers in Mercedes to and from airport. Fast, friendly, on time. My flight was significantly delayed and the driver was there. Clean, well maintained, well managed. Good breakfast selection. Great Trastevere location if you like to be pretty close to all the Rome tourist attractions but just far enough removed from the primary tourist scene to make you feel just a little more \"Roman\". Rome is a walking city. Part of the fun is walking through the neighborhoods to get to your destination. Most tourist attractions are within a 30 minute walk. These include the Colosseum, Vatican, Trevi Fountain, Forum, Pantheon, and great Trastevere area restaurants. Comfortable bed. Reasonable mini bar prices compared to most hotels. Great courtyard. Even though it was winter on the warmer sunny days I was able to comfortably sit next to the olive and lemon trees in the courtyard to enjoy lunch, work on the computer of just sit. Some things that were worth dealing with (for me) in order to enjoy the list of Pros above. I am guessing that 2000 year old sewers and old buildings just don't function quite as well as in my high-rise apartment in Vancouver or suburban home in Connecticut. There was occasional sewer gas back-up from the bathroom. I delt with it by opening the windows and/or keeping the bathroom door closed. A couple of times the breakfast service was not ready as scheduled. Due to the small size (6 rooms and a few apartments) the cleaning staff are not on site all day like you might find in larger hotela. There is a relatively small window for room/cleaning from 9:30 am to about Noon or 1:00 pm at the latest. In my case due to jet lag or schedule I was sometimes in the room or sleeping and missed a few days of cleaning service. One day they assumed I was in the room sleeping (as I had been the previous day) and they made the decision not to wake me to clean the room. It was an understandable trade-off decision between taking the chance of waking me or letting the room go unserviced one more day. They chose not to wake me, although I was not really there. Rome is a noisy city. Old masonary buildings transmit sound well. I am used to noise after living in New York City for a major part of my adult life so the noise level here was not an issue for me but might be for people who expect absolute quiet. Even though the rooms at Le Clarisse are situated around a beautiful courtyard street noises can be heard at night. You could also hear frequent footsteps up an interior stairway that must have been just on the other side of the wall in the adjoining building. The wall in the bathroom between the Rose room and one other room is very thin. Voices travel easily between the two rooms. Keeping the bathroom door shut at night solved that problem for me. The convertible bed was not comfortable. A friend from New York City joined me for 6 nights. We each took three nights on the convertible bed located in the separate entry hall area of the Rose Room.

They are genuinely friendly and authentically helpful. The hotel is ideally situated in the Trastevere neighborhood of Rome, is fairly priced and offers great value to many travelers. All of these things are pluses, but can be minuses, as well. First, location. Trastevere is the hip travelers' current darling and I have to wonder why. It is dirty and every surface is defaced by graffitti. It's full of tourists US college students and many of the restaurants show that with subpar cuisine and high prices. If you're there for art, there are a few nice things to see but hardly a treasure trove. The first few days, we were in such a dash to get out and see all of Rome's many attractions that we didn't really pay attention to it. After a few days, however, the graffitti became exhausting and mind-numbing. Second, value. For the budget traveler, this hotel is great. However, after a few days, we would have preferred a touch of luxury - natural fiber blankets, more stacks of towels (instead of the one set allotted per person per day); evening maid service to make up the beds after our post-museum, pre-dinner naps; and other amenities. If you do choose to stay here (and you won't be sorry, just know what you're getting), insist on staying in the rooms of the main hotel.

And it's about to get even better! We arrived in Rome jet-lagged from the all-night flight and a bit intimidated by an unfamiliar city of this size. And we a little worried when our shuttle driver wasn't familiar with the address and had to look it up in his big book of maps -- while he was driving! But once we walked through the door of Relais Le Clarisse, our tensions and misgivings melted away. We were greeted by the bright, cheery smile of the woman at the desk. She assured us that, though we were there quite early, our room would be ready soon. We left our luggage in the tiny lobby and went out to visit the funky section of Rome called Trastevere (\"across the Tiber\" from the main part of Rome). We made the short walk to see the church of Santa Maria di Trastevere (perhaps the oldest church in Rome), and by the time we got back to the hotel, our room was ready, and we took a short nap in what would quickly become our cozy little home in Rome. Relais Le Clarisse was very small when we stayed there, only five rooms. By September 2010 several more rooms will be added next door, in addition to a more visible and easy-to-find front door. So there will be a room for you, and we recommend you reserve one. Our room was spacious, the bathroom modern and fully equipped. The air conditioner had a hard time keeping up with the August heat, but we were never uncomfortable. And the simple, free wifi came in handy for sending photos to friends back home. But it's the staff that makes Relais Le Clarisse exceptional. Every one of the women (and it was all women, until our last day) was cheerful and helpful and went out of her way to make our stay a happy one. Trastevere proved to be a good home base. It's close enough to the major sites of Rome (just across the river from the Forum) that the intrepid can easily get around on foot. But it's far enough away from the main tourist attractions to be a quiet refuge at the end of the day. And the restaurants (and gelaterias!) in the neighborhood are superb. We stayed three nights at Relais Le Clarisse, then picked up our rental car and toured Tuscany and Umbria for the next ten days. Coming back to our Trastevere retreat on our final night in Italy was like coming home. We were welcomed back like old friends. And a nightgown my wife had left there had been kept safely under the front desk for our return. Rome is an incredible and exhausting city.

The bed was comfortable and the shower nearly a room unto itself. The desk staff was helpful and friendly, as was Mauritzio, who seemed to show up whenever we needed a ride to or from the airport no matter where we were in Rome (by all means, if you're flying in, arrange for your transfers through the Relais - it's not an easy place to find the first time, and Mauritzio is the epitome of charm.). All the rooms open onto a well-maintained courtyard (a wonderful place to eat breakfast) and the Rosa also has a window onto a second courtyard, which tended to get noisy as people got up and started about their day - and that worked out perfectly for us as that kind of stirring is a much more peaceful wakeup than an alarm clock. Of course, if you don't want that morning wakeup, you can always close the window and turn on the air conditioner (we didn't as the room was just fine in mid-June with the windows open).

There are dozens of very good restaurants within an easy five-minute walk (and while Spirito di Vino might be a seven-minute walk, it would be worth a seven-hour walk - which is about what you'd need to walk off dinner there. It was, by far, the most impressive meal we had in two weeks of eating at some very good restaurants in Rome - including Il Marguta).
