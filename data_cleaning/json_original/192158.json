Arriving at the hotel, I was impressed by its location, only 10 mins walk from Victoria tube, and on a beautiful street, with lots of impressive Victorian terraces. Inside the hotel, I was allocated Room 3, which was in the basement. I was somewhat dubious but my room was actually lovely, really clean with a wonderfully modern and clean ensuite. Despite booking for a single room I was given a family room which had a double bed and a single bed, with lots of floor space which was ideal! The room had a nice new TV, tea and coffee facilities as well as a full length mirror which being a girl, I appreciated!! The only negative thing I have to say about the hotel was the noise at night. I was down in London for an interview so had somewhat of a restless sleep anyway because of nerves, but the noise that was made by other guests was the main contributor! At one point, I thought the guest next door was in the room with me, I could hear him that through the walls! I would say that if you are staying there because of business, just to be aware the noise could be disturbing, but if you are looking for somewhere reasonable for fun break in the city, then this would be perfect!

I was a little disappointed with room 5 as it was very small but the sheets were clean and the shower was amazing so overall felt we had got a good deal considering location. I noticed we were directly opposite the breakfast room but didnt think anything of this at the time as it was a closed off space....How noisy can tea and croissants be anyway???.. VERY is the answer. What we werent told when we checked in was that a door in the hall next to our room which we thought was a cupboard was infact a makeshift kitchenette and the staff began noisily clattering crockery and cutlery at 7.30 on SUNDAY morning right outside our bedroom door!! that was bad enough but when the breakfast room opened inconsiderate guests were running up and down the hallway shouting about the lack of bacon. I was really looking forward to a good nights sleep after a great night out on the tiles but sadly after being woken up i couldnt get back to sleep due to the high levels of noise. Even after complaining to reception the kitchen staff continued to be noisy and after an hour we could take more and checked out in a rage - all this before 9.30am - not the chilled out morning i had been hoping for. I am still so disappointed with my stay as it started so well and this experience did make a bad ending for an otherwise brilliant weekend away. I would still recommend this hotel to friends as it is good value BUT i would suggest if, like me, u like lazy sunday mornings, avoid the basement at all costs especially room 5.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Malta", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for London's West End!\u201d", "Author": "MFLZ", "ReviewID": "UR123451020", "Content": "I would like to add my recommendation to those of other lodgers who have stayed at the Victoria Inn.

Bus No.2 and others also stop nearby and these ferry you across to Marble Arch, Oxford Street.. etc for easy shopping. What more can you ask for? :) The Hotel itself is very friendly and the staff were all very polite and helpful. There is a lift to the rooms and the standard of cleanliness is impeccable.Hot water, showers, TV, kettle and appliances all 100% functional and the complimentary coffee and tea in the room most welcome.

I asked the receptionist to come and look and he declined he did apologise but said there was nothing he could do and the manager would be back in the morning, I was so cross and frustrated had it not been so late and such a scary night in London (due to riots taking place) I would have left and found accommodation elsewhere, I returned to the room and decided to use the towel to cover the back of the toilet, I then noticed that the toilet roll roll holder was broken and came off the wall (this was also covered in excrement), the whole place felt filthy, When we arrived at the hotel I was asked to sign a disclaimer stating that I would agree to pay \u00c2\u00a350 to deep clean the room if we did not leave it as we found it! What a joke This spoilt what was meant to be a treat we couldn't wait to get out the place! The following morning in the cold light of day we could see the whole room was a bit grubby, we went down for breakfast to the smallest dinning area, we was asked by a lady if she could help us and I said yes if she could find us a table and chairs (and was told rather rudely that the dinning area had been open since 7.30 and we should have come down then) we didn't stay for breakfast and went to look for the manager, at reception the same man from the night before was there with a lady whom i thought was the manager (turns out she wasn't the manager was still at home and they had no idea when she would be in) but they did speak to her on the phone while we were there and she offered us \u00c2\u00a320 compensation! I was enraged! but was told we stayed the night (I did point out that we had no choice due the lateness and rioting within the city) I told them I was looking for a full refund of \u00c2\u00a3165 as this was a horrendous overnight stay in the hotel which I would never recommened to anyone and I also said that I would be contacting yourseleves for a full refund and leaving my review on tripadvisor.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTerrible !\u201d", "Author": "ginger143", "ReviewID": "UR116468558", "Content": "Room tiny and cramped, no seating or dressing table.

Pity it wasn't free wifi but I always take a mobile broadband stick so it didn't matter to me that much. Free wifi would definitely be an advantage for the hotel though. The breakfast area is a little too small if you are unlucky enough to have everyone descend for breakfast all at once and you're then relying on people to be sensible in that situation and not all crowd round at once as it just blocks everything up. A few of us waited for a few people to clear before getting our breakfast but that's beyond some people I suppose! Anyway, all in all. it's a lovely little hotel at a decent price for the centre of London. There are plenty of eateries and pubs if you don't want to stray too far on an evening and if you do want to go a little further then everything is still within walking distance.

Admittedly there is decorating work going on, for which allowances were made in our opinions of the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful but hardly dressed to impress. The whole reception area was cluttered, even a steam iron was set up ready to use in the background!! There was a distinct grubby air about the Victoria Inn. I found myself saying to my husband that I was embarrassed at how this type of Hotel portrays our capital city to the rest of the world. Surely to have a Hotel in London is something to be proud of?!? Expensive because of the location, yet sadly the style and care is somewhat lacking when compared to hotels of a similar price range in other European Cities. When we first entered our room, we were welcomed by what we assumed was an unflushed toilet, not nice!! However, after several uses of the toilet we realised that the plumbing was to blame as previously flushings seemed to reappear a few moments later. Eugh! The plug in our sink got stuck so water would not drain away, washing of hands became difficult and so we used the shower instead of the sink to do this, which was not an easy task. The shower was a good shower though! We did tell reception on our way out on the second day. When we returned the sink had been emptied of water but the plug was still firmly in place so yet again, nothing would drain away. I presume that the ancient 'Henry' cleaner outside our bedroom door was used to suck away anything left in the sink? As for the breakfast, well I didn't even venture down to the stuffy dining room on the 2 mornings we were there. Bad coffee and equally bad breakfasts leave me in a bad mood and I felt unable to take the risk so I chose to get my breakfast elsewhere, even though it was included in the price of the room. My husband however, decided to brave it and went downstairs, returning a while later with the comment 'you made a wise choice in not having breakfast here!' The restaurant was tiny, cramped and 'locked' down in the basement. No windows - just recirculated burnt toast air! Coffee was close to unpalatable, it was only because my husband was thirsty did he drink it! He had chocolate the next morning... A good English breakfast is neither difficult nor expensive to create and would really boost a Hotel's business, so why do we get offered such cheap and nasty food and drinks? Hardly a good selling point for you.... So all in all I am embarrassed by the whole experience, being a budget hotel should not mean grubby and inefficient with a cheap and nasty breakfast. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone, such a shame as I really would have enjoyed the 2 nights so much more, had a bit more effort and care been apparent. I find it insulting to my intelligence that the owner of The Victoria Inn Hotel feels comfortable treating people so badly. Visitors must surely come to London from all over the world, and come to stay in hotels like this one. Wouldn't it be far more cost efficient to get good reviews or perhaps the owners are happy to have visitors come to stay just once? I imagine that they must be happy with their turnover, people book the room, feel sad and disappointed but then move on, never to return. No wonder the rooms have to be paid for in advance with no cancellations, no one would want to pay the full price after staying in such a sad and grubby hotel..!

After telling me the name of the hotel I looked it up on Trip Advisor and was rather disappointed by the reviews on the site, but we were pleasantly surprised to find a major refit taking place. The reception was piled high with bathroom fittings and tiles when we checked in, and found that disconcerting, and they remained there for the duration of our stay. This also meant that fewer sofas and armchairs were available to sit upon. The bedrooms were actually very good as they were effectively brand new, with newly fitted carpets and bathrooms and the smell of fresh paint. The windows were old but that was not a problem. The room my wife and I had was on the top floor, and although the ceiling was slightly lower the floorspace was larger than the other two rooms on lower floors. We also had a view of the top of Big Ben and the London Eye. The breakfast room is situated in the basement so there was no natural lighting and this was a bit of a shame. The continental breakfast supplied was actually rather good, but don't be fooled into upgrading to a 'Cooked Breakfast' as all they give you is a Frankfurter sausage, fried egg and baked beans for \u00c2\u00a34.95 - not satisfactory!

The reception and breakfast room were ok: simple but clean. The hotel building has a very complex structure. I guess at a certain time they included the next door building because to reach our room (510 I think) we had to cross different stairs, going up and down again and through hallways which also funtion as fire escapes. But since we paid less than 30 EUR per double room per night it was a good bargain! However, I wished I had paid more. I looked at the photos of other visiters and they do not reflect what we encountered at all (maybe they have started some well-deserved renovations in some rooms?)! We stayed in the hotel with a party of 6 (3 double rooms) and probably my room was the worst: The room is smallish (European) but ok if there wasn't a huge KITCHEN (with stove, fridge, microwave and all) blocking half the room. Moreover, the legs of the bed and the closet were crooked. The bathroom is tucked away in a plastic closet-like construction. We had to leave the tap on for 5 minutes before warmish water came out and a few times the water even stopped during a shower. The nasty thing was every time my friend flushed the toilet, the waste water seemed to be bubbling out of the kitchen sink (which was less than 50 cm away from the bed). I guess the larger, nicer bathrooms with blue tiles on the photos are the shared ones. Conclusion: since we only paid peanuts for our 5 day stay we don't have any reason to complain. The trip was great and we only stayed in the hotel for short periods of time at night.

We had a groundfloor double room and the bed practically filled the room - the TV on a wall bracket had a huge \"Mind Your Head!\" sticker on the side to make the point. The \"decor\" was dated and the bed linen looked old and over-washed. The tea and coffee facilities consisted of a couple of cups and saucers, two teabags, two sachets of sugar and coffee. After a difficult and very cold trip through London, we arrived after midnight and needed a hot drink. However, there was no milk, and when I asked the receptionist for some, in broken English he explained that he didn't know about milk and he only worked there one night a week. The bedroom was very cold on account of a large, draughty single-glazed window which overlooked a surpringly nice little courtyard with tables and chairs for milder weather. The bathroom/wet room was a joke. It looked like someone had taken the single-mold plastic cubicle from a decommissioned ferry and stuck it in the corner of an already tiny room. It was a grim green colour, the metal fixtures were scummy and when you sat on the toilet, it came away from the wall with a loud, metallic \"clunk\" and threatened to fall off completely. Having worked in hospitality for a number of years, I can say with some confidence that this is not a 3* hotel. I have stayed in nicer 2* hotels with nicer staff, cooked breakfasts and well-kept rooms. While I don't doubt that the bedrooms you see in their website pictures do exist, I certainly didn't see any indication of such quality while I was there. Having said all that, the location is fantastic and after long days of travel and sight-seeing, the hotel does do a good line in comfotable beds. And when you're too tired to keep your eyes open, you don't tend to care so much about peeling paint and misspelt signs!

The lobby is just fine, would need a renovation. But for sure is the best spot of the hotel. I started trembling when i first saw the key to the room, that was RIDICOLOUS, a piece of grey plastic with the room number written on it with a black marker.... i tried hard not to laugh in desperation. They showed us the way to our triple room, and the room was incredibly small! The bathroom was very small and poor. No free soaps or whatelse....The carpet of the room was old and little dirty, the wardrobe was just fine but i didn-t even try to put my clothes into it and the curtains and the bedspread were quite dirty, even if my mom said they were clean but old stained... don-t know.... I am always worried about bedbugs and looking at that room i was even more worried because it was so cheap, but luckily there wasn-t.... I complained immediately to the reception saying that i was disappointed. Their web site was all but what i found once there, but they couldn-t help except showing me another room, that was on the low ground floor, and was cold and a little bit smelly. We preferred staying in the original one. The breakfast the day after was ridicolous, 4 slices of bread and some marmelades.... No bisquits, no chocolate, no yoghurt or fruit, and the drinks were also poor, and the worst... no space where to sit, as the room was incredibly small, and the hotel fully booked. The following mornings we went to have breakfast at Starbucks nearby. Finally i want to say that even if the staff was very friendly and available, the hotel was horrible. The worst i-ve ever stayed in my whole life. It would need a complete renovation and a change of management, because the location is nice and could be a great small hotel. But probably they just don-t care. They get the money anyway.... I must say that also all the other hotels nearby except Sidney Hotel, Corona Hotel, BW Victoria, Easyhotel seemed very poor, so probably Victoria Inn was just average.... but still!!!

The nightmare started when we booked in after 23 hours of travel to find we had been allocated a twin share room - despite being very specific in all correspondence about it being our honeymoon! We were informed there was nothing that could be done as no other rooms were available. The next day we were moved to the only available double room that was in the basement and was so small not enough room to open our suitcase and had no ventilation. On the third day we were moved yet again to room 6 which was (admittedly) a reasonable room. The manager of the hotel is the rudest person we have ever had to deal with for a customer service complaint and agree with your other reviewers that she should not be working in the customer service industry. When we complained about having been allocated a twin room she was very agressive, raised her voice at us and told us it was too bad and if we didn't like it we could get out of her hotel. We could not believe the size and standard of all the bathrooms (after having 3 different rooms we are able to comment on a variety of them)! The showers are so small you had to stand like a tin soldier once you were in, water was always covering the floor, and the toilets are very tightly squeezed in. The breakfast room was also the worst we have experienced. There was no ventiliation so it was really hot and stuffy and it was constantly overcrowded with nowhere to sit. The food was of a very average standard - basic toast, cereal and tinned fruit. On a positive note we found the cleaning staff really friendly and a couple of the front desk people also nice. The location of the hotel was quite central being a short walk to a couple underground stations. It was however very unusual that we were required to hand in our key at reception every time we left the hotel??? I am absolutely baffled as to how this hotel manages to keep it's star rating as it certainly does not compare in any way to any other hotel we have stayed in. The favourite part of our stay was definitely checking out!

The only thing I was really disapointed in was the breakfast. It was quite meagre, jusy three cerial choices and some toast and jam, but I shouldn't have expected more for the price. The beds were comfortable and there were small tea pots in the rooms which was really nice. There is also a computer you can pay a pound or two to use in the lobby. This place was really lovely overall. I noticed no smoke smell; perhaps this has been improved since other reviewers were there.

It was our first stay in London, so didn't really know what to expect. From the photo's on the website, it looked like a very nice hotel, with decent sized rooms, with nice spaceous en-suite bathrooms. Our room (No 37), was on the 4th floor, so had to use the 'lift' to get there. Once we got into the room, we were very disappointed. The 'en-suite' was basically a porta-cabin in the corner of the room. The door opened outwards as there was so little space in it! The 'shower' was a very small triangle, and the water went everywhere. This left the toilet, the sink and the floor very wet and slippery. The room overall was tiny, but clean. On the first morning of our stay, we went down for breakfast (in the basement). There was a queue to get in as the room was so small, and couldn't properly cater for the number of guests staying there. After a 10 minute wait and still no seats, we left the hotel and went elsewhere for breakfast. The next morning, we didn't even bother going down there. The positive aspect of staying here is the location. It is just a 10 minute walk to Victoria Tube / Train station. It is ideally located to explore the city, and the public transport network in the area is great. Overall, great location, not so great accommodation.
