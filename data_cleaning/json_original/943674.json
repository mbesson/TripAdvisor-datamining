I'd say its a 3 Star hotel. Basic, clean, big rooms, en-suite, great local breakfast. I'd recommend this hotel for a good value break. Its really well located. You must get the metro when you transfer from the international airport. 2 lira token (about 70 cents) and just get on. The last metro stop (about 20 minutes on the metro) and you are 5 minutes walk to the hotel. The hotel is about a kilometre from sultanhamet (15 minute to 20 minute walk) which is the location of the main tourist and historical attractions and half a kilometre from the Grand Bazaar (uber huge shopping market). The breakfast was varied and fresh local salads, soft fresh bread, awesome view of the sea. Hotel service is ok. No problems from me. We spent on average \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 per night for both of us including breakfast over 6 nights. This is not the Four Seasons Hotel. Spend \u00e2\u201a\u00ac250 a night if you want that. Our room was big, had a sofa, small table, TV (BBC, Russian and French TV). Water was always hot for us, room was warm in December. I'd guess that aircon here might not be perfect in all rooms in July/August, but its just a guess. The pool is small, but was warm enough. You can get a turkish bath in the hotel for a reasonable price.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Service": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sulaymaniyah, Iraq", "Title": "\u201cHotel condition and Hospitality\u201d", "Author": "jamalezzat", "ReviewID": "UR118264728", "Content": "the location of the hotel is good and close to tramway and other buss stations as well as reastaurants BUT I was desapointed by having such a bad aircondition and miscommunications with the hotel reception, in addition to that not changing bed covers for 7 days and they only did after several complaining, having only one power plug to charge my cell phone, camera and PC, with only two lights one in the bath and the other one in the room, in fact it was a tabe lump.

Having arrived in Istanbul very late at night we saw the hotel and got a reasonable price for the room. We were told it was a 4 star hotel but I saw on the net that it is a 3 star. The room was fine, quite spacious, although quite hot. The AC didn't seem to work very well. My main issue arose on the day of our departure. On this morning I thought I had lost my second passport so we were 15 minutes past check out time. I went down to reception to ask if I had left my passport there but was greeted by an extremely rude man who paid no attention to the fact that I had perhaps lost an important document but kept insisting that I was late for checkout and that he would charge me another day if I was not out of the hotel in 10 minutes. My other passport was still at reception from check in time so this man flung this passport at me, insisting that this was my passport so there was nothing to worry about even though I persistently tried to tell him that I had two passports. I was quite distraught by this time, worried I had lost my other passport and upset that I was being treated in such a rude manner. I would not stay here again as I have never been treated so rudely and with such disrespect ever before.

But, when we got to Istanbul, we were told we had to go to another hotel because there was no air conditiong in Aspen Hotel. We stayed at this other hotel for two nights and then we were forced to go back to Aspen Hotel. Thank God, it was our last night, since we still had no A/C and it was leaking and the bathtub was leaking. Other people in our tour who stayed at the hotel checked out before they completed a night there because there was no A/C and the rooms were small.
