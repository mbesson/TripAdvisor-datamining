I reserved a one bedroom condo for a 10day trip to Hawaii for my sister and I after a very tough year. I made an error on what side of the island I booked on, so I take credit for my error there. This is the wet and windy (and cold) side of the island. The view from our condo was lovely, although we didn't and I only saw 1 person swimming off that beach and that was to jump in and jump out. Upon pulling into the parking lot there is a horrific smell of sewage until you got inside the condo (Gigi's response to that was: \"There is no septic issue and that it's normal\". In addition, \"that the full time residence have gotten USED to it\"). I personally don't know how anyone could get \"used to it\". Upon entering the condo there was a very large, dead cochroach in the middle of the floor. I could overlook that due to the area this condo was located. As we got settled we found multiple issues to add to our first negative experiences. The dishes are grimmy, the blender broken and filthy, there was mold on the rubber stipping on the refridgerator and freezer, ice machine broken, the dish drain/dryer was filthy, rust in the bathtub, oscillating fans were piled w/dust, and a few additional smaller issues. We reserved this unit for 10 days and after washing all the dishes, and items in the cupboard decided that we'd stay. Things continued to add up during our stay that after the 6th night I booked a room elsewhere for our final 2 nights because i just couldn't \"deal\" anymore. .I guess I have a high standard of cleanliness. I did not address these issues during my stay due to not wanting to complicate a restful and relaxing vacation w/my sister with a dispute with the owner Gigi. When I addressed my concerns w/her when I returned home, she did not respond for a week. When I wrote her again a week later asking if she got my email, her response was: \"I got your email but was so shocked at my accusations and experience that she had to THINK about it\". After getting her response, she basically said \"I'm sorry and that's what you get in the country\". In addition, she said \"if you would have called me while you were there on the first day, I would have come over and rewashed the dishes\". As I explained to her, I would never have had her come into our unit and our private area to watch her rewash the dishes. That seemed very invasive to me. I told her that I had pictures of the filth and broken items I told her about and she actually refused to see them. (and I invited her to see them multiple times). Her response to me was that it was like I \"ate the dinner, licked my plate, and then said the food wasn't good\". Another thing we couldn't do in my business is offend or be disrespectful to our guests. As I admit to staying all days but the last two because I had had it with pulling up to this old, rundown, offensive smelling, condominum. Just because one uses the facility, doesn't mean that it HAD to be a pleasant stay, which it wasn't when we were there. I am a very resonable person and understand things happen, but when I was continually told what I SHOULD have done, by Gigi not even willing to see the photos/proof of my claims, and there is no real apology or respect to the situation, I feel as though this is my only outlet to warn other people to not get mixed up on not only the location but the ownership of Gigi's. Being in this business, I think long and hard before ever taking this step and putting a negative experience out there as I know the damage it can do. I am sure that Gigi will respond and defend to this review as she hasn't taken any responsibility up to this point, nor has made any service recovery attempt.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pacific Northwest", "Title": "\u201cAttention to detail could make this almost perfect!\u201d", "Author": "Traveldanse", "ReviewID": "UR121338906", "Content": "While this falls under the \"hotel\" category on Trip Advisor, Gigi's Paradise are actually condo units along with Pat's at Punaluu. I stayed in a 1 bedroom condo last time; this time it wasn't available and I splurged on the penthouse suite, which has 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. The weather on that part of the island is a little more rainy than other parts, but the best part of this property is having a sandy, swimmable beach sometimes to yourself, and minimally not crowded. It's quite a drive from most of the tourist stuff (right on the way to the north shore and a little over an hour from HNL) and that's why I've stayed there twice now. I like to live like a local when I come to HI. No A/C because of trade winds, but this unit does not have a side slider like the 1 BR unit so not as cooled down when you have to shut the front sliders due to rain. The temperature was usually comfortable. You must be really fast to shut the sliders as rains can come in an instant and the slate tiles get very slick if wet. Unit is showing some wear and tear (it is an older property.) At least 3 window handles were broken, making the windows inoperative. It felt like the fridge and dishwasher doors were going to fall off in my hands when I opened them, but worked fine. The toilet chain broke in the downstairs bathroom (this is a 2 story unit.) Upon arrival, the only 2 clocks (including 1 on the stove) were both flashing, there was an empty Pepsi can in the fridge, lint in the dryer trap, some little stuff under master bed and a few ants around the sink and upstairs bathroom tub. Cans of paint and other stuff stored in bedroom closet...not where I'd store that sort of stuff but I didn't use that bedroom so not too big a deal. Otherwise was clean. She does warn you up front there is very little stocked in the way of paper products and I found there was no electric can opener. Otherwise, Gigi has the kitchen stocked with dishes, glasses, silverware, pots and pans, microwave, etc. Beds very comfy, plenty of seating in the common areas, assigned parking, cable TV, secure building access, pictures are truthful as to what they show. I spent a lot of time in top floor master bedroom. The view from there and the living room is fabulous.

I stayed at this complex in one of the condos and although it was nicely appointed, modern and had a great view, there is undeniable traffic noise from the bedrooms. I moved into one of Gigi's cottages and I never wanted to leave! The cottages are closer to the ocean and the only noise you hear is the ocean lulling you to sleep. I live in Waikiki year round, so having a place like this to get away to is priceless. The cottages are funky, quaint and charming, each one furnished in a kind of a cottage shabby sheik. Don't expect anything fancy, or you will be disappointed, but the location of the cottages will have you as close to the ocean as you could possibly be. They have everything you need, dishes, basic food items (generously left behind from previous visitors), beach towels, change of linens, snorkels, beach chairs, etc. and are all very clean. But what they mostly have is AMAZING VIEWS, BEACH FRONT LOCATION and QUIET! The beaches are great for swimming and protected by a large reef. Great snorkeling and beach combing. Never more than a few other people on the beach at the same time. There is a small convenience store almost across the street with necessities, and plate lunches, plus a Subway Sandwich shop. A few miles down the road is a local grocery store and a bit past that is a larger strip mall with a nice grocery store, shops and restaurants. Also close by is the Polynesian Cultural Center. Plenty of great beaches along the way for swimming, fishing and exploring. Don't come here if you want to eat out every meal, hit the bars and night life scene. DO come here if you want to taste the beauty and the land that is Hawaii. The prices, for Hawaii and for the incredible beachfront location, can't be matched anywhere on the island.

We stayed in the Pukana La Paradise, which is in a cottage fourplex, upstairs. It was very peaceful and relaxing, the view from our room was amazing. I loved waking up and the first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was the ocean. I easily drifted off to sleep every night to the sound of the wind and waves. The room was fully furnished, even down to plates, utensils, blender, cookware, and beach activity items such as boogie boards, snorkling gear, and beach mats. There is no air conditioning, but it is not needed; just open the windows and a nice cool breeze cools the room in a matter of minutes. Previous guests also left behind items such as shampoo, conditioner, shaving cream, and spices to cook with. We loved the fact that this place was way up along the Windward side of the island, away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and Honolulu. We were able to really experience Hawaii and relax. The locals in the area were some of the nicest people I have ever met. Kamehameha Hwy is a beautiful drive along the coast. And if staying here, you absolutely HAVE to try Mike's Hawaiian Huli Huli chicken truck...its two yellow food trucks on the side of the road past a gas station on the right. It was my favorite place to eat! The Huli Huli chicken, kaulua pork, and Hawaiian steak were delicious! My brother and sister-n-law stayed in a very nice condo on the 6th floor...their view was amazing. My mom and dad stayed in a downstairs cottage fourplex a little ways down the beach from us. Out of all the rooms, I think ours was the best. There is nothing fancy about it, but it has a real beachy, laid-back feeling that made us instantly feel at home. My favorite part was the lanai...its not completely open, which protects you from the sometimes strong winds, but it is open enough that you feel like you are on an open lanai. The only negative thing I have to say about this room was that there is a sliding door that separates this room from the one next to it and the wall is pretty thin; our last two nights there, the newest neighbors had a baby that would wake up crying at about 5:30 in the morning...and would wake us up. Other than that...I absolutely loved it there. We will definitely be back. Also...if you rent a car, which most people do, remember to put your parking permit hanging from your rearview mirror every time you park in your assigned space!

Nicely and comfortably furnished 1 bedroom condo with ocean view lanai that I spent a lot of time on (although a chaise lounge would've been great.) Very well kept and clean overall, hardly any bugs at all which is amazing for the country, although vent above toilet needs cleaning. Nice property with pool and picnic tables on the grass/in the yard between the condo and beach. Two elevators were usually readily available. Gigi was easy to work with. Bed was very comfy, but the bedroom is streetside and to get any airflow from the tradewinds (no AC) to stay at a reasonable temperature, you have to put up with a lot of noise. This property sits right off the one lane highway that goes around the island that is traveled 24/7 by all kinds of noisy vehicles. (and the elevator bell, the rooster,etc.) I was hoping to sleep by the ocean sounds (which in the living room, that is what you hear.) As light a sleeper as I am, I amazingly slept pretty well. I didn't want to try and move furniture around to sleep on the sofabed or rollaway which were options to sleep on \"by the ocean.\" Has everything it says it does, but do plan to bring your own supplies. First house or condo rental ever I've been to not provide laundry soap, but she tells you that up front in the paperwork; same with TP, but there were a lot of available items like dishwasher soap, paper towels etc. Shop at the Safeway in Kaneohe on the way up, or there are some scattered supermarkets further up the north shore from the condo. The one closest (north 10 minutes? Hauula I think) is on the smaller side. Sandy swimmable beach in front (took me a couple days to get used to it but ended up liking it.) Not crowded (except for Vet's Day when an Asian male sports team showed up and loudly and obnoxiously took over the beach for about 45 min.) This is more isolated and a place to relax than to be busy like in Waikiki; more country local living, which is what I was after.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kalamazoo, michigan", "Title": "\u201cA Quiet Romantic Retreat on the Beach\u201d", "Author": "k-zootravellers", "ReviewID": "UR82122058", "Content": "e stayed at Gigi\u2019s for the second time and thoroughly enjoyed it once again. We stayed in A-4 and the kitchen, bedroom, and sun room was roomy, yet cozy. The sunroom is stunning as it overlooks a picturesque beach and is perfectly situated so that the trade winds provide a refreshing balmy breeze. The sun and the sound of the waves make it an ideal place to relax and read a book. We stayed two nights in Honolulu, and were struck by the contrast. In Honolulu we heard the noise from passing cars. At Gigi\u2019s we occasionally heard the cars from the two lane highway, but most often only heard the sound of the nearby surf. It is amazing to fall asleep, and to wake up, to the sound of waves. We enjoyed beautiful sunrises, and also an incredible moonrise, with the full moon glowing over the Pacific Ocean. It was a sight and a memory we will never forget. It is a quiet place of retreat and rest. It is not actually in a town, so you do not have noise from nearby neighbors. (We recommend renting a smaller vehicle, as the roads and parking spaces are fairly narrow.) The kitchen is amply supplied with pots and pans, providing all you need to cook your own meals. Previous guests left a number of condiments and assorted canned goods and other non-perishables. It was easy to cook our own meals and saved us a tremendous amount of money. The beach is buffered by a long coral reef, which creates a calm area to swim and snorkel. The snorkeling is not fantastic, but is sufficient if you seek out the coral and rocks where the fish gather. We saw approximately 50 different varieties of fish. Be careful of the current as it runs from south to north. Your best bet is to enter the ocean towards the south and let the current take you north. If you want to experience the natural beauty and quiet grace of Hawaii, we highly recommend Gigi\u2019s.

Which is excellent. Well, enough about the neighbors. The unit is a nice old fashioned beach house. The unit was clean and functional, everything we needed was available. A bit of everything for a good visit to the islands. A beach cabinet with a bogie board, snorkels, beach chairs, etc. The upstairs has no lauai, but there is a sun room, so we could sit, eat breakfast, and watch the ocean. You do have to remember you are on the East side of Oahu, so you get sunrises, not sunsets. Then again you are close enough to the top of the island to bring a picnic to Sunset Beach and watch the sunset there. Late one night I told my BF that listening to ocean was like listening to a Corona commercial. Their was only the sound of the waves. Very relaxing, and the ocean sound lulls you to sleep. As for the beach, you can't get much closer to the ocean without getting wet. We did go out and snorkel right off the beach, what looks like small islands at low tide are actually large coral structures, with colorful fish. Since it is a trek to Honolulu, not far by California standards, but the top speed for most of it is only 35 miles an hour. So, slow down and get into the island spirit. Stop at all the artist's shops on the way, and the Mac Nut outlet. There is also Kaulia with wind surfing and kayaking. A visit to Byodo-In temple at the Valley of the Temples, yes it looks like just a cemetery, but there is the most serene Buddist temple just past the Cemetery. Lots of things to do on the East side of the Oahu, especially if you really need down time and want to experience Old Hawaii at it's best. Would I stay here again, silly question. Of course!

So I read the old reviews of this place from over a year ago, which were pretty bad, but then I read the more recent reviews, and it seemed this place had improved greatly. It has not. So, I\u2019ll start with the good: Gigi was very professional and efficient in booking the place over the internet. We received great directions and found the place easily. The suite really is as pretty as it is on her website, and the view is amazing. The king bed was super comfy. Lots of closet space and ample hangers. Lots of nice thick towels, and beach towels provided too. The shower had lots of hot water and great pressure. Great TV and cable. The kitchen was stocked with the very basics, but left us wanting. It was nice to be in a laid back place and out of the craziness of Waikiki. Other people staying here were very friendly. Lots of nice beaches in the area. Now the bad: Not clean \u2013 at all When we arrived the suite looked nice on the surface. As soon as I went into a kitchen cupboard to get a glass, there was this grinding noise as I removed it. All the cupboards had a layer of grit in them, similar to the type of grit you get when sanding drywall. Then I noticed that some of the plates, glasses, utensils were dirty, and began washing them. The dish rack was covered in such a layer of grunge I refused to use it. The kitchen sink and the drain stopper were disgusting, like they have not been cleaned in ages. There were cobwebs on the ceramic utensil holder. There was food left in the fridge, some deli style pickled fish that had expired 3 weeks before we got there, and some 6month expired jam. Then I went to unpack my bathroom items, and the bathroom cupboards were all covered in grit too. Upon opening the bathroom drawers and found more drywall type grit and two dead roaches. Look, I don\u2019t freak about roaches, I understand they are part of a tropical vacation. BUT, they looked like they had been lying there for weeks. More cobwebs in the corner of the bathroom. Another layer of drywall dust type grit on the toilet paper holder. In the bedroom I went to place some items in the open shelf on the nightstand, and my things got covered in a big layer of dust. The last blow was the dryer. I did a load of laundry as we had already been traveling a week and I was looking forward to nice clean clothes. The washer worked great, BUT the dryer deposited a layer of white grit on all our clothes. I had emptied the lint tray which was full, and when I checked the laundry after 20 minutes the lint tray was full again with all this white grit. The dryer vent was also blowing white grit all over the place. So, I phoned Gigi about 5:00 pm on a Friday night. She was very professional and said that she would get someone there right away. About 10 minutes later, a cleaner arrived. He did not tell us he was the regular cleaner/maintenance man, and he made it seem as if he was cleaning up after one of his staff. He wiped down the bathroom cupboards/drawers. He said he would come back the next day to clean the kitchen cupboards and dryer. I told him to take the kitchen dish rack with him and told him I couldn\u2019t use it because it was so grungy. I assumed he would return it cleaned the next day. He did not. So we had no dish rack for the remainder of our stay. (no dishwasher in this unit) I told him the kitchen sink was disgusting. He said it was just rust. It was not. The cleaner said we would get our cleaning fee refunded. The next day he did come back and he wiped down the kitchen cupboards and cleaned the dryer vent. It was explained to me that they had removed a popcorn ceiling, and that this was probably the grit that was in the dryer all over our clothes. The cleaner also said he would fix the front closet which was not on its track. He did a quick fix on the closet, and guess what, the next time I opened the front door, the breeze coming from the ocean picked it up the closet door and blew it off again. I assumed the cleaner would do a thorough cleaning of the whole place after seeing how dirty the place was, but he did not. He never cleaned the kitchen sink/drain stopper, nor did he bother to dust the whole suite, or to wipe down the glass dining room table which had a haze all over it. In fact all the mirrors seemed to have a haze covering them. That day Gigi\u2019s dad came by and he did refund us the cleaning fee. He apologized sincerely. However, he never followed up to see how well the cleaner did. Bedroom noise: None of the other comments on this website mentioned anything about this! We were happy to be in a nice cozy bed and settled in for the night when the noise started. The bedroom window is glass shutters which means they do not close completely and they don\u2019t have a seal like a proper window. This suite is behind the elevator and every time the elevator stopped on the floor, you would hear the bell announcing its arrival. Next you could hear all conversations people were having by the elevator. I like to chat with people too when I\u2019m a tourist, again my issue is with a window shutter that doesn\u2019t shut out any noise. The parking lot has a big square metal plate in the middle of it (probably a sewer access) and each time a car drove over it, we would hear a loud \u201cclunk\u201d. The generator which is located in the parking lot was pretty much in line with this suite, so we heard the generator all night long too. You could hear all the street noise, and on top of that a rooster started cock-a-doodling at some ungodly hour. The rooster didn\u2019t bother me but it sure bothered my husband! We both commented on how our condo in Vancouver, a city of over 2 million people, was quieter than this! So we moved the bed into the living room for the rest of our stay, and it was very quiet. It\u2019s a concrete building, so there was no noise from neighbors, all we could hear was ocean waves. Awesome. When we went to move the bed we found two more dead roaches under the bed and a thick layer of dust. Even though the bedroom was tile apparently the cleaner could not bend down to sweep under the bed. And finally, the are small things: No ironing board (although an iron provided) No dust pan(although a broom provided) No: coffee, sugar, spices (other than salt/pepper), not even plastic wrap. ( have I just lucked out in getting this in every other rental I\u2019ve had??) No phone book (although there happened to be some by the mailboxes so I grabbed one and put it in the suite.) No pans to warm a pizza in the oven or to make anything in the oven (except for a small loaf pan) No ice cube trays (although there is a permanent sign on the icemaker that it is not hooked up) No snorkeling gear provided in this room. The liquid bathroom hand soap was so watered down that I\u2019m not sure even an ounce of soap was actually left in the mixture.", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, OR", "Title": "\u201cWe Love Gigi's!!\u201d", "Author": "valonmur", "ReviewID": "UR22830606", "Content": "This is our 4th trip to Gigi's in 8 years.

Isn't it funny how \"people\" see things differently. To me, Gigi's Paradise is just that. Offering all the charms of beautiful tropical beach and forest. The units are all so quaint and as a previous guest mentioned, you feel at home and restful. Each unit is unique with an authentic Hawaii feel. At night, no need for a wave sound machine, the ocean's sound is real and so relaxing. A perfect beach for so-so swimmers who want to enjoy the nice clear, calm water and not be thrown around by big waves. The beach is so private, no sand kicking in the face, perfect to walk, take a dip, swim and relax. Some people are just so unhappy, that no matter what, where they are, they will find something to be unhappy. I have recommended this place to so many people, including my former manager and they loved it so much that they returned the following year for a 3 wks stay! So......if you are a person who loves beautiful beaches, nice home away from home....this is the place for you!

We arrived two days ago and are really loving it. We were happy to find the place based on Gigi's info that she mailed after getting our payment. We are staying here with our two kids (ages 10 and 13) and really enjoying exploring the area. The other guests are very friendly--the first ones we met were also from Alaska coincidentally enough. One other helped us load our groceries into the elevator. Kind of a unique way to get to the room and probably could use a cart or something. But it works. Yes it is an old building. Yes it is not a hotel and never claims to be. It is more like staying in someone's nice little apartment while they are gone and having them leave all kinds of things for you to borrow. Like snorkling gear, nicely rolled up beach towels in the hall, lots of lush towels, a fully functioning kitchen with all kinds of handy items. We love to cook and we have happily picked up local fresh shrimp and Ahi to cook up. The beach behind the place is great for swimming in and viewing big turtles. In fact my son was on the balcony spotting turtles today and we were lamenting forgetting our binoculars when I found a pair in a cabinet by the door. And there is a swimming pool as well which we haven't tried yet... too many beaches around to bother with that. We were surprised to find a nice cable tv too for those evenings recovering from the cruising around. It's in a great location for going to many north shore beaches. The first night we got in late and I went to a 7-11 just south of the place. Not recommended. But luckily there are shopping centers just a couple up miles farther north. I'm really relieved there is no big developments around the area. So if you are looking for someplace off the beaten path and you don't want the big crowds and polished resorts at a reasonable price, this is for you. If you want things nice and perfect and spotless, go pay two to four times more for something with room service and a maid, stay in Waikiki. Frankly we were into to seeing Hawaii not the bathroom tile in a Best Western.

I had originally located the property on the internet...the web site shows some amazing views, rooms, etc. I knew going in it was not a hotel and we were prepared to cook, shop, etc. to be on the east side of the island. We arrived on Oahu in the evening, driving to the 'condo's'. Upon arrival I was greeted by a monolith apartment building that appeared pretty run down. I had my wife, two kids (then ages 2 and 5) and my mother-in-law. As soon as we exited the rental vehicle there was a strong smell of sewage. The elevators were old and clunky and in general, the place appeared pretty run down, as well as the folks in the area looked pretty shady, like the neighborhood belonged more in the inner city than in a beautiful spot on the beach. When we hauled our luggage to the room, we were finding rust in the bathroom, gratings, windows and sliding door. The sliding door would not lock as well and, although advertised as having a Lanai, it was barely big enough to accomodate, much less want to sit in the 'so called' furniture. We managed to find dirty linens, the bathroom was filthy, the sewer smell was even prevelant on the floor we were on, on the ocean side yet. The appliances were dirty and had seen better days. The only shopping I saw in the area was very small and some distance, other than the small package store, from the property. We were tired and disillusioned as we were expecting what we saw on the web site...boy, were we suprised!...on top of this all were tired and two small kids were exhausted. We grabbed our luggage and left, staying the remainder of the time at the Hilton on Waikiki, much better.
