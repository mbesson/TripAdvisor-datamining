Our taxi dropped us off at the main road and instructed us to walk a few mins down this promenade. We pulled two heavy suitcases each, past street performers and gypsies in our faces, begging for money. Being on the street is great during your stay.. but getting your luggage here is a nightmare!The hotel is not clearly marked - and to make things more confusing, there is a Petit Palace on every street corner. We overshot the hotel and stepped into \"Petit Palace Arenal\" by mistake. We left and pulled our luggage back to the Petit Palace Puerta Del Sol. The quadruple room we booked was unavailable. The woman offered 2 double rooms instead. We insisted that the 4 guests remain together after flying 17 hours to meet. After all, we paid for a quadruple, and she would not price adjust for 2 doubles. She called Petit Palace Arenal to confirm they had an available quadruple room there. So again, we pulled our luggage right back to Arenal. There, we discovered that the room would not be ready for 2 hours! After travelling across the world, this runaround was ridiculous. We returned to Petit Palace Puerta Del Sol and accepted whatever room was immediately available. We needed sleep! The double room was TINY. There was only room for two adjacent twin beds, and barely space to walk around it (picture posted). Upon sitting on the mattress, I became itchy and developed red bumps. We immediately called our travel agent for help relocating to another hotel. The front desk was notified of our early departure while we were still on the phone w/ the travel agent. Seconds later, the front desk woman was pounding on our door... demanding that we leave at once!!! She refused to let us continue our phone call to make other accommodations, claiming that she would be unable to resell the room if we stayed another minute. She stood at the doorway as we collected our belongings and ushered us out of the hotel. We were left stranded in Spain, with no accommodations and no local phone to arrange lodging. We never heard an apology. In fact, they somehow made US feel guilty for inconveniencing the front desk when in reality, they could not provide the service for which we paid. Rather than making a scene at the front desk, we quietly attempted to arrange alternate accommodations. In retrospect, we should have given her a piece of our minds. Worst travel experience ever.

Other little signs of neglect, that by themselves wouldn't be a big deal but added to the whole picture of needing to be upkept : dirty grout, water stain on ceiling, patched chip in the shower, unpatched holes where the pipes went in/out.

The location is what prevents me from just giving this place 1 star.

The symphony of noise created by hard wooden floors, loud animated conversation and vacum cleaners, ensured that no lie in was possible. Although annoyed with such lack of sleep, we thought that it was sheer bad luck, and perhaps the next night would be better. At about 5 the next morning, we were awoken by drunken shouting and laughter from a group of inebriated hotel guests right outside our door.

We (my sister and I) had asked for a front view room and paid for such in our reservation (booked directly with the hotel) and were given a back room. We then registered our objection in my bad spanish and were promptly given a front view room with a little balcony on the 4th floor. Was slightly noisy with the windows open, but the airconditioning is excellent and there is obviously glazing enough to shut out the noise when the windows are closed. We slept well the both nights we stayed there. I would recommend this hotel as good value for money for the excellent central location - everything is on your doorstep or a short bus/metro ride or a pleasant walk away (eg Prado etc). The style is very modern and clean lines - which I kind of prefer to the British traditional floral/chintzy stuff in hotels, but noticed it appeared to have been done on the cheap in some bits (the bathroom fittings - depends on the location of your toilette in the bathroom!). Still, I have stayed in heaps of 2,3,4,and 5 star hotels for work and leisure, but when it comes to value for money for a quick weekend getaway, this is really a very nice, comfortable, friendly, centrally located little hotel with very co-operative English speaking staff.

We stayed here based upon the outstanding reviews written here. We had a good experience, and WOULD STAY HERE AGAIN, but would avoid it if you have children (even with a quad room). The quad rooms are the same as any room except that they put a bunk bed in it. We feel that the reviews do not tell the whole picture, and we want to provide other travelers with a bit more insight on this location. The value is outstanding and difficult to match [excellent]. The location [excellent] is clearly ideal if you want to be in the center of town and metro and 2 blocks from Plaza Mayor etc., (which we did). The noise level is understated in these reviews. There was construction from 7am to 9pm, and the windows do not seal well enough to block it out effectively (if you push on the window it blocked out most of the street noise). There was also contruction and welding next door and underneath this hotel and the odor of welding permeated throughout. The rooms are CLEAN, but there were several odds and ends that needed repair (sink countertop was not attached, some loose mouldings, dripping air conditioner vent above the door, etc.) The rooms are definitely compact [ok for a two adults, but add a child or two and it doesn't work]. Small fridge in the room is nice. The rooms have no drawers to store your clothes, only three shelves in the closet, and the closet is quite small to begin with. Air conditioner adjustment is difficult, it's not an actual thermostat, so the room was either an ice box or an oven. Elevator fits 2 people with bags, snuggly. VERY rickety, it slams open, and it did not work at all on 2 occasions [difficult for us since we were on the 4th floor and had a baby carraige to carry down 4 flights]. Buffet is not included depending on the rate you pay, and it's 11 Euros if you pay for it directly [not even closely worth that price]. Highly recommend you opt for the lower room rate and forego the buffet considering all of the terrific food and values right outside the door of the hotel. The showers are nice, but I don't know what the rave is about the shower heads, these are not hydro showers, there are merely 4 small horizontal heads at house pressure. A nice touch is the lighting. Lots of reading lights on the bed, and 4way controls let you turn room lights off from the wall or either side of the bed. Free high speed internet access in the room was wonderful, we brought our laptop and emailed family pictures everyday. Majority of the front desk staff are friendly and accommodating. They do not stock too many ammenities though. This all being said, we would easily stay here again, but not with kids unless they were in a separate room.

The area is older but shops are more dense, and 1 min from the metro and minimal stops to other newer/posh areas where hotel rates were quite high. The hotel itself is new with only 6 floors and although the furnishing finish is not exceptional (eg they used laminate floors instead of wood) it's good enough for a short stay for a 3 star hotel!
