Check-in was a little long winded as even though my booking stated I was travelling with my 10 year old son and I had emailed the hotel to reconfirm this a week prior, yet again the Furama was another hotel that had given us a room with 1 queen bed. Seriously! After getting up to the room the lovely porter saw that I was quite distressed (we had just travelled for 12 hours), and kindly spoke to reception on my behalf and had us moved to a deluxe room within 15 minutes. I must say that I am glad he did as the deluxe room was much larger. (we were originally in a superior which was pokey). Strange that they simply could not have put us in the deluxe to start with. A couple of points to mention: Breakfast was ok, worth having it included but not the best I have had. Coffee was revolting! Location - as mentioned in previous posts it is in a great location, one block from the MRT and a stroll to Clark and Boat Quay which was a nice option for dinner and happy hour drinks on the water. The glass bathrooms - I know previous posts have mentioned this in a negative way but it really isn't a major problem as there is a full length blind running behind the bath that can be pulled down for privacy. Pool area/gym - nothing special but it was a nice way to cool off after a day of walking and we were often the only ones there. Pleased that the chlorine level wasn't sky high! The gym was small but the equipment was well maintained and the area very clean. Beds - I found them very hard. We asked for mattress toppers which made them a lot more comfortable and housekeeping arranged without any hassles. Staff - the porters and concierge were lovely and always smiling. It was very busy at times with flight crew (lots of Cathay Pacific and Air France) in the lobby but reception was well staffed and we had no issues. Overall - would I stay there again? Yes if I got the same rate (approx AUD160 per night) and only in the deluxe rooms. Shop around for a good rate.

The only drawbacks are that although the hotel has an outside pool, it does not have full spa facilities (sauna, steam room) and I was a little dubious of the state of some of the corridors leading to the standard rooms as they looked in need of an overhaul. One other thing to note, was that we were on the 4th floor and the sound-proofing of the traffic outside was very poor meaning a few nights of disturbed sleep.

At the planned time of stay, the rate was around $200usd per night. Now I'm not exactly crazy about the Swissotel, but it is clean and does the job. At $200usd though, I wanted to look for alternatives. Ultimately we settled for the Furama City Centre. Upon arriving, the hotel itself looks rather old from the outside. When we got to our deluxe room, it was small but very clean and quite comfortable. You can tell that the room has been remodeled. But at least we got our requested room with smoking and a single queen bed with zero hassle. They even allowed us to check-in 30 minutes before the actual check-in time of 2pm. Last time we couldn't even check-in at the Swissotel until almost close to 4pm, even though we arrived at 1:30pm (another reason why we looked for alternatives). One of the main draws to the location of this hotel is that it's right next to Chinatown. Not only Chinatown, but also the Chinatown MRT (5 min.) and Clark Quay MRT (8 min.). So the Swissotel is right on top of the City Hall MRT, but the walking time is actually about the same or more, depending on how busy it is on the way. The one thing that wasn't so great is the hotel gym. It consisted of a treadmill, some hand barbells, and a situp machine. How small is the gym? About double the size of the hotel bathroom, that's how small it is. But definitely not a deal-breaker on a short 4 night stay. Never once was the hotel lobby noisy and packed with people. Checkout took us a whopping 30 seconds. So that's another advantage of not staying in a large mega-hotel. Checking in and out is fast and stress-free. So if you're looking for a clean hotel located in an area with some more character and lots of food bargains in the surrounding area, Furama is an excellent choice.

Aside from being on a higher floor with a better view, the actual room was identical. We had access to the executive lounge, which had a cocktail hour, plus canapes. However what they meant by \"cocktails\", is that they have 4 bottles of spirits in a corner, which you can pour yourself, into cans of softdrink, which you also pour yourself. Not really my definition of a cocktail! The snacks they served were good though, and they would just keep bringing them out, so you could almost get away with just that for dinner.

I booked the stay through Asiatravel where they had a reasonable rate which was also offered directly by the hotel. Generally, it was a very disappointing stay. I had previously stayed here a number of nights over the years but the room on this occasion was different, supposedly renovated but it actually seemed to be less pleasing than the rooms on previous visits, which were a number of years ago. The check-in was alright and the attendant seemed to be friendly but there seemed to be a bit of backchat or enquiries going between the reception staff after the check-in. The porter arrived with the luggage quite quickly after I had arrived in the room and I just wasn\u2019t happy with his attitude from the outset. Firstly, he asked me where I was from, which was fine. Then, upon hearing the answer, he lightened and made a remark about how he thought I looked as if I was from the People\u2019s Republic of China and he made it seem as if there was a problem with that. Then, I gave him a tip and then he made a remark that it was only $2, so then I gave him another $2 so he was happy and left. The lobby itself wasn\u2019t large or grand but it was alright. Unfortunately, throughout my stays here, I always remember the lobby as being quite crowded and there usually isn\u2019t a place to sit down so that\u2019s something that I think the hotel needs to consider. During this stay, the hotel seemed crowded. Unfortunately, i wasn\u2019t allocated a good room and that was quite disappointing, considering the room rate of $S170 nett not incl. breakfast. The room had no view at all and seemed to be quite small. Looking at the plan of the room on the fire escape diagram on the door, it looked to be about the smallest room of those they had available on that level and I wasn\u2019t sure what I had done to deserve such a room allocation. The room itself, apart from its size, also did not impress. It didn\u2019t seem to be well-designed and I\u2019ll get to the details of that later. The carpet was dark, it was worn and didn\u2019t look to be very clean. It seemed as if there was an attempt to make the room appear stylish but, in fact, the room was quite poorly designed. First of all, I had quite major problems in the bathroom. The bath took a very long time to fill if the water was allowed to go through the bath tap normally. It was only after the cap/plug was pulled (which was on top of the bath tap and normally just diverts the water flow from the tap to the shower and vice versa except the tap here didn\u2019t have a shower) that the water \u2018flowed\u2019 with sufficient strength to fill the bath in a reasonable amount of time. Actually, the water did not flow but spluttered out and made a mess of the bath and also started to fill the floor. It was necessary to just stand there pulling this cap while trying to contain the mess on the bathroom floor. I filmed this aspect of the bath and the video is on my Youtube page (http://www.youtube.com/AllHotelrooms). Realistically, the bath would have taken almost half an hour to fill if left to fill through the tap. Also, it seemed as if the bath could not be secured properly through the stop and was leaking a little water and that would have prolonged the process of filling the bath. While the bath tap was running, it was not really possible to adjust the temperature of the water. Instead, pulling the plug/cap enabled the adjustment to be made but if the water was allowed to flow through the tap normally, then the temperature would not be correct. The tiles in the bathroom also appeared to be medium-slippery, while they were still probably safe, they did not prevent a small slip in either direction before halting the slide. It was difficult to find a resting position in the bath itself, it wasn\u2019t comfortable by any means. My bath was also not free-standing, unlike in some of the photos which appear on Tripadvisor, where the room category may be different. Generally, my room didn\u2019t look as pleasing as the photos on Tripadvisor for this property and I suspect that\u2019s because I was not allocated a good room. The difficulties in the bathroom didn\u2019t end there. While it was nice that there was a rainshower available, the problem was that the water droplets were too large and hence the shower wasn\u2019t really comfortable. The sink itself was located close to the door and I wasn\u2019t too sure about this design either, as I use quite a noisy shaver which might actually cause noise pollution if placed near the door. Other aspects of the room also disappointed. There was a musty smell upon entering the room and I wasn\u2019t sure if that was caused by the aircon. The aircon itself was quite loud at night but it was powerful and the room didn\u2019t appear to be stuffy. The bed itself had a yellow stain and upon seeing this, I wondered whether this room was actually allocated only for a specific purpose. The room was noisy, soundproofing really wasn\u2019t very good. The sounds of other bathroom drains were obvious, loud and strong throughout the night. There just seemed to be water gushing through by the sound of it. The iron was not of a high quality and didn\u2019t seem to work well, it couldn\u2019t achieve the task of flattening shirts. The TV was the only positive aspect of the room, as it was large and of a good quality backed up by a wide channel selection. I was so disappointed by the room compared to what it appeared like on previous visits that I went to the reception desk to ask about their wood-panelled rooms and whether it was possible to stay in one of those instead. The reception member just didn\u2019t seem able or willing to give a straight answer and waffled on about how some of the rooms were Superior-category and didn\u2019t have any views, which was not an issue I mentioned in the first place, as I was only talking about the previous-style wood-panelled rooms. Then, she talked about how the rooms with views were on higher floors and they were deluxe rooms. However, the hotel website as of date of writing and of booking did show superior rooms with a view and also with the wood-panelled design and her long-winded answer which didn\u2019t address any points directly was clearly made to ensure that I stayed put. She also seemed to be quite practised in her response and its delivery. I do, however, get the feeling that the rate I paid should have qualified at least for a room with some view, even if of the lobby. Generally, the standard of construction just wasn\u2019t there and as mentioned, the functionality was also not of a level associated with the usual brand names. I\u2019m not sure who the hotel engaged to design the rooms but their level of knowledge and expertise clearly doesn\u2019t compare to any of the established brands. The location of the hotel in Chinatown was quite a strong point and the hotel is close to an MRT station but that\u2019s often the case with hotels in Singapore. The best that could be said of the check-out experience was that the staff member did her job. Prior to the checkout, the housekeeping staff member rang my doorbell at about 11am a few times. When I went outside and asked why the two staff members rung the doorbell, since the check-out time was noon, the housekeeping staff member couldn\u2019t provide an answer because she didn\u2019t speak much English and she just said: OK, OK. The other staff member was engaged on her handphone and couldn\u2019t be bothered to break that engagement to provide an answer. Overall, this was quite a disappointing stay and it was very unfortunate because I remember that I had much better stays here prior to this one. Previously, I would have given the hotel four stars but on the evidence of this visit, it only deserves two.

The room (a \"deluxe\" room on the fourth floor) was pleasant and sunny, with a window overlooking a terrace, and was kept spotlessly clean. It was also reasonably priced for Singapore.

Room - Not well appointed. Basin is in-room, nearby the door. Water may be spread out after you wash your hands, face.

There are 4 lifts but they are divided into 2 groups working separatedly and on 2 of the lifts you may not know they are going up or down except you enter it.

Lobby is on the first floor, not at the basement. check the room they assign u first, and if u don't like it, go back downstairs and ask for another room ! they seem to have a tendency to assign the worst rooms first and then see if the guest agrees or complains. particularly, if u book the room at a favourable rate.

I then complained and they gave me another room, which had twin bed instead of Queen bed, but at least it was slightly bigger. the interior is very dated and definitely NOT worth more than 3-stars. the carpet very worn and not clean, almost disgusting. the only nice thing was the bathroom, which could easily be rated 4-stars and had obviously be renovated not long ago. But as they rate themselves on the several booking websites as \"4,5-stars\", I must say: that's a good joke. maybe the few \"executive rooms\" they have are worth that ranking, but the rest is just dated 3-star quality. the breakfast was included in my room-rate, but oh my god ! that relatively small coffeeshop had to serve 445 rooms ! you had to queue to get a table, no, not a table, just a seat, joining someone else's table, but that's fine. they squeezed as many tables as possible in that coffeeshop which made the entire atmosphere extremely unpleasant, you could baerely walk between all those tables and chairs. I wonder how the staff can work under such conditions on a daily basis. staff itself at the coffeeshop was friendly nevertheless and they were well organized, Kudos to them, and the quality as well as the variety of food was quite okay. but I am not used to have my breakfast in an atmosphere that resembles KL's Puduraya Bus-station two days before Hari Raya. would I recommend this hotel to anyone? honestly, only if you can manage to get a VERY favourable rate or if you have the strong desire to stay in the middle of Chinatown, otherwise, better stay somewhere else, particularly as this is one of those hotels which charges extra for internet (25 S$ per day).", "Date": "May 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lugano, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cView from a wheelchair\u201d", "Author": "Affe", "ReviewID": "UR65763295", "Content": "This review is based on wheelchair accessibility (except rating).

The room was of good size, clean and well decorated. The bathroom was large and well equipped, but had no wash sink in it - the sink was located in the bedroom. This worked, but wasn't ideal in our view. The third bed was a portable, and less comfortable than the other beds. The double bedroom looked out towards the rear of the hotel, and had a balcony (which we couldn't access). The room was well prepared, quite spacious and had a pleasant modern feel to it. The only problem we had with the room was that the bathroom was enclosed in a glass walled room - very modern no doubt, but rather disconcerting to find the other occupant of the room could see you showering, bathing or using the toilet! Admittedly there was a blind to pull down on one wall, but it did little for my sense of modesty!!! The wash sink was (as in the other room) located in the room rather than in the bathroom. For some people the bathroom issue may be a trivial issue; for others it may be critical. The breakfast was of a good standard with lots of choice of both western and eastern food.

For the same price, I stayed at Swissotel the Stamford in 2006. This time round, we had to settle for Furama City Centre - right in the middle of Chinatown. In all my previous visits to Singapore, I had never set foot in Chinatown! We had no regrets staying at Furama City Centre - it was way beyond our expectations (or rather we didn't have much expectation to begin with). The check-in went on smoothly though the check-in personnel attending to us was not quite fluent in English. The rooms seem to have been refurbished. Though the hotel has been around for some time, the rooms smelled clean - there was no musty smell nor was there any foul sewer smell. The rooms were of decently sized (even for a standard room). The bathroom was also decently sized (big enough to fit a bathtub AND a separate shower cubicle. Breakfast was also decent. We are one lot of very satisfied guests. The parking was complimentary.

I booked through Travelocity after reading through the reviews on Tripadvisor. The rate ($124.49 total including taxes and fees) is very fair based on my experience. I was given a room on the 4th floor. Reading other posts, apparently the 4th floor rooms are new and my room looked in very new condition. I did have an outside window but the view is only of some potted plants on the outside ledge. For those reviewers who were stuck on an inside room on the 4th floor, I can say you didn't miss out on much. I think you would have to be on a higher floor to have any decent view. The room would have been small for two but I had plenty of room by myself. As previous reviewers have posted, there is no closet, only drawers and shelfs along with a bar for hangers. Because I was traveling with only small carry-on luggage, this did not pose a problem. Those traveling with large suitcases would find limited space. The room was very clean. All the furnishings were in good shape and looked very new. The bed was very comfortable. There was a flat-panel TV in the room. I was able to recharge my Blackberry without using an adaptor. The sink was located outside the bathroom. As seen in other reviewers' photos, the bathroom is glass-enclosed. The side where you get into the shower stall is only half-covered by glass. It was very difficult not to get water into other parts of the bathroom. This is very similar to other Asian hotels I've stayed. I haven't figured out a way not to get some water outside of the shower stall. The other side of the shower stall is the glass panel facing the room. There is a blind that you can pull down to cover the glass but I noticed that there is enough gap along the side that someone in the room can look in and see you taking a shower. I suppose if you don't mind that's not a big deal. But it can be a bit embarrassing otherwise. Same can be said about sitting on the toilet. There is also a nice large new tub in the bathroom that I did not use. As some others have noted, the room can be damp due to Singapore's humidity. It was hot and humid when I first got in but after blasting the AC it quickly cooled down. I did not encounter any dampness walking barefoot. I did notice that my hand-washed clothes took longer than usual to dry. I used the fitness center on the 5th floor. It's a small room with some light dumbells along with 2 aerobic machines. Luckily there's AC in the room. Around the corner is the outdoor pool and jacuzzi that I did not use but both looked fine. The pool wasn't very big. Being on the 5th floor, there was not much view either. The exterior of the hotel is rather bland. The location is excellent, less than 5 minutes walk to the Chinatown MRT. Chinatown, Clarke Quay, Boat Quay, and Robertson Quay are all within walking distance. Jumping on the MRT will take you just about everywhere. Most people consider Maxwell Food Centre in Chinatown one of the best in Singapore and I certainly agree. I tried about 5-6 different food stalls and stuffed myself. Everything was delicious. It's only about 10 minutes walk from the hotel. Singapore's heat would have been bearable if not for the humidity. I found myself looking for the next store with AC every 10-15 minutes.

The staff in this hotel is EXTREMELY friendly and helpful--all staff. The buffet breakfast was very good with a wide variety of eastern and western food and a great coffee machine. We had an early check-in (11am) and a late check-out (1pm). The pool is nothing special and does not appear purpose built but is ok for a quick dip and some exercise laps. The location of the hotel is a real plus. Easy walk to Clark Quay and to Boat Quay. Also to Chinatown. Just 5 mins or less walk from MRT NE4 and also MRT NE5. Two stops to Harbout Front, Vivo City, bus to Sentosa. Really nothing to complain except for no window in the room. Other rooms had windows, maybe they are more expensive?

I suspect they were using the website rates as a bait-and-switch tactic and did not want to rent me the room at the cheaper rate. Other than the small trouble getting the hotel to take payment, service was reasonable for a mid-range hotel - there were no problems, but no instances of outstanding service either. The swimming pool is hidden away along a long corridor and down some steps - which is just as well really as it is tiny - one look at it and I didn't bother.

The hotel didn't look like a hotel from the outside, which took me aback for a minute when I got out of the cab. However, the first thing that greeted me was the helpful concierge. At the reception, everyone was very friendly and made me feel welcome, despite the busy atmosphere. I got a room on the 8th floor, but it had recently been repainted and the fumes were bothering me, so I asked to be moved. The staff who responded to my request were very friendly and professional, and sorted me out immediately without making me feel like I was being a hassle. I was given a room on the 10th floor right next to the elevators. The elevators didn't bother me, you couldn't really hear them unless you were in the bathroom, and I'm sure there were people using the elevators often as the hotel was fully booked. I'd booked a superior room with a double bed. The room was certainly smaller than the room at the previous hotel, but it was about half the price, and the internet was faster I think, either that or there was no one on it! The bathroom was surprisingly nicer too. One of the best things about the hotel, though, is its AMAZING location. Amazing amazing amazing! I didn't know how close I was to Clarke Quay until I decided to be 'adventurous' and walk back to the hotel after a night out. It was about 5 minutes. If I'd known that I wouldn't have taken the MRT the night before! 3 minute walk to Clarke Quay MRT, 3-4 minute walk to Chinatown MRT. Extremely convenient. Sorry, I can't stop raving about how close it is to Clarke Quay. So overall, pleasantly average rooms good enough to shower and sleep in. Very good staff, which really makes a lot of difference when you're in the hospitality industry. I'd asked to extend my checkout time, but they were running a full house and the lady politely declined my request but kindly apologised to me, so that was fine. The front desk staff were all very friendly, the concierge were friendly too, housekeeping was very nice as well. Great location, need I say that again.

We eventually found ourselves in a little bar in the Duxton Hill area of Chinatown by which time all restaurants in the vicinity had stopped serving meals. The friendly bar owner took pity on us and as we left gave us a carefully wrapped parcel of chocolate brownies to eat when we got back to the hotel. The following days we spent taking trips around Singapore Island, visiting Changi Prison, Changi War Cemetery, a fascinating crematorium, crocodile farm, bum boat trips on the Singapore River, Little India, Raffles Hotel, the glittering shopping malls in Orchard Road, and a trip to Sentosa Island in a tropical downpour, mainly using the city\u2019s excellent MRT system. We ate in the Furama\u2019s 24-hour coffee shop late one night, but apart from that took meals on Boat Quay and Clarke Quay, and a wonderful restaurant on board a boat in Singapore Harbour looking back at the glittering skyscrapers of the city.

No mini-bar, old-style TV with only a few uninspiring channels, no pay-TV, no bath, shower was lukewarm at best. The in-room safe was not working. In-room broadband is available, but rather exorbitantly priced. Luckily with the government of Singapore providing free city-wide WiFi, there's really no need to pay for internet use. Breakfast is expensive, but you get it free if you stay 3 or more nights. Just as well, if I had paid I would have complained, as it was easily the worst I have ever eaten at a high-class hotel.

On the positive side, it does have a superb location - on the edge of Chinatown, just across the road from an MTR subway station, and just 10 minutes walk to the oh-so-trendy nightlife area of Clarke's Quay, where you can sip overpriced drinks with the rich and beautiful at glamorous riverside venues that rival any in London or New York.

The bathroom was fine, offering a shower cabin and a bathtub, well lit and clean. The room also had a safe and TV set with very limited selection of programs (like 8 or so, only some in english).

On the third day, weird things started to occur: In the morning at 6, we hat an unwanted wake-up call. Someone drunk 3/4 of our unopened bottle of mineral water. 2 towels were missing in the bathroom. On the following days, other such annoying events took place. I guess they wanted to make us pay for our insistance on obtaining what we hat booked. One more thing to mention: on a 5-night stay, they didn't bother to change the bed sheets once. I had stained sheets on the first day, and they remained so tor the next 5 days. Cleanliness is really an issue in this hotel.

It was very clean, comfortable and it had a great view looking towards the big wheel and river. The room had everything we needed including a walk in shower in the very clean bathroom. The hotel was in an excellent location near Chinatown, very easy to get around. The staff were superb, especially the girls in the executive lounge, very friendly and helpful. Yes the lobby is a little dark but lots of hotel lobbies are similar to this. The pool area and gym were lovely. There are two entrances, one on a small side street, not scary as there are plenty of people around. The other accessed from a bridge over the road or from the pavement itself. This leads to a walkway which takes you past a few older shops to the lobby area. Overall we were impressed and would definaltely return to the Furama. We also treated ourselves to two nights at Raffles which we will also review. There are so many things to do in Singapore, it is not just a one night stopover city. We especially enjoyed the Night Safari, the Zoo, go for the Wild breakfast, a bumboat ride, Chinatown Heritage Museum, Changi Museum, the Arab Quarter and the Battle Box at Fort Caning. It was very pleasant walking around, even at night. We felt very safe. Lots of shopping if you want that as well. The only mall we went to was Raffles City Mall and that was excellent. Eating out was superb. We especially enjoyed Blue Ginger, Nonya food, try the chicken and black nuts at Tanjong Pagar. Empire Cafe at Raffles, great local food and very reasonable. Indochine Waterfront, great location, excellent food, fab Vietnamese coffee. Bumbu in the Arab Quarter, great surroundings and lovely Thai/Malay food. The Thai restaurant in Raffles City Mall had fantastic fish. We also had Sunday brunch in the Bar and Billiards room at Raffles which was amazing! If you enjoy spas try the Eucalyptus Spa at Tanjong Pagar. It was really good. It doesn't look anything from the outside but is nice inside. My wife had five hours of treatments for about \u00a3125. She had a full body scrub, a Parafango body wrap, full body massage and Shirodhara and Reflexology. She also went to the Amrita Spa at Raffles, more in that review.

We were out most of the day so the hotel was adequate for our needs i.e. a place to stay for the night. Below are some points regarding the hotel. 1. Amenities Being that there were two guests in a room, we were given one set of toiletries. We asked for an extra set but it never materialized even after repeated requests. Two bath towels and a bath mat were provided each day nothing else. 2. Staff Handling Situations a. Staff at reception was accomodating. The aircondition in one of our companions' room wasn't working so they had someone fix it. Unfortunately that did not help plus the fact that the rusty sprinkler system fell on my companion's arm!!!! Reception obliged by moving them to another room. Puzzling though was that they sent a plate of 3 fruits and a card for a speedy recovery. Wonder if it was a local cure to rub the fruits to the wound! b. An unfortunate incident happened to one of the guests of the hotel. A Korean woman riding the escalator up to the reception area fell backwards with her luggage in tow. Maybe it was a mistep or something. Anyways, the concierge staff and some hotel staff immediately went to her aid and even called an ambulance. So that was good. The whole point of this story is whilst staff were attending to the woman, staff left the other guests to their own devices. I am not being not being incompassionate but the situation did not require ALL of the staff to attend to the woman- all they did was to ogle at the situation and pinpoint at who was at fault. The hotel should have assigned or dedicated a team of staff to tend to the woman whilst the other staff still carried on with their normal duties. It seems that the hotel forgot they have other guests to attend to. c. Pool Staff There was a pool guy hiding in his airconditioned office. Guests just pick up a towel and return it after use. If I was not a guest of the hotel, I could have easily used the pool without question. The pool was located on the 6th floor across some guest rooms. Usually hotels have a separate wing for the gym and pool. So if you stay in this hotel, don't stay in rooms around 611, 612, 613 etc. just because the hall could be busy with guests going to the pool/gym. d. Concierge There are some concierge staff which were friendly and accomodating like the day concierge staff. The concierge staff during the time of the Korean woman's accident (evening staff) couldn't bother with our questions for directions, and hurridley answered our questions just to make sure we don't bug him anymore. 3. Hotel Environment a. Reception Area - Lighting around the area of the escalator where the Korean woman had an accident was quite dim and not brightly lit. The reception area was also a bit too dark/dim to my liking. It looked dated (apart from the \"mod\" sitting chairs) and everything looks yellowish with the dim lighting. b. Rooms Adequate and basic c. Restaurant Only had breakfast that came with our package. Again nothing fancy, same thing served everyday. 4. Others Taxi is not that easy to hail but it will come after a while. The MRT is nearby.

Booked online with their own website as it was cheaper than expedia or asia rooms. Paid around 65 Sing Dollas a night without breakfast. Arrived at hotel around 3am. The staff answered our questions they were not rude but they were not happy smiley either. We had to crash out in the lobby for a few hours (at first they said we would wait until 8 am but we got in at 5 am) no worries there as I had not told them we were coming. However we were not offered a drink, a chance to buy a drink or even a glass of water. They did what they had to do, no more, no less. The lobby and the public areas are tired and in need of a refurb. The plants hanging down the fake marble surrounds were also tired and in need of water, food or replacement. The seats we sat on to wait for the room were stained, missing buttons and there were no cushions. Again the lobby did what was expected at that was it. In the morning, full of people the lobby felt like a different place but even so it was still tired. The rooms were excellent, newly refurbished and for me a very comfortable bed, for some maybe too hard but good for my back. Efficient and fast internet was another $S25 a day and you had to book how many days you wanted with no credit returned so best to do it daily or for each 24 hours you want. The view from our side of hotel (1521) was not much cop but from the parents room (1807) was much better. Breakfast was OK and the usual hotel buffet thing. I never ate, as this kind of medium quality breakfast does not appeal to me, better on the street right outside the hotel (also only $6 a beer!!!). But my wife had an OK continental breakfast each day for around $14 ++. The restaurant staff though for such a transit type hotel in a city like Sing spoke quite poor English and thinking outside the box was not easy it seemed either. We did not eat in hotel otherwise as too many good Restos we know already in Singapore. The hotel was good value for the money (as Sing is so expensive) because the rooms were good, without that I would has been disappointed. Lastly I reported some faults in the room that they did not fix them in 3 days or give me feedback to say they had tried. This for me was the general attitude of the staff as a whole.

Overall I had a positive stay there. My room, whilst just a standard one was more than adequate during my stay. It was kept very clean by housekeeping and was serviced early in the day meaning fresh bedding and towels by early afternoon. As advised on here I requested a room away from the elevators, wise advice indeed. I discovered when I was using a room on my last day to have a shower (The hotel provides this service free if you have a late flight leaving Singapore after you have checked out) that was next to the lifts that they are pretty noisy and can be heard clearly through the wall. Another tip I picked up here and would also recommend is to buy your water downstairs at the store round the front of the hotel run by the older guy who also sells electronic goods. He has a fridge in his staore and charges SGD $1 for bottles water compared with the hotel price of SGD $4 from the mini bar The beds, whilst pretty firm, were OK and comfortable enough to get a decent nights sleep. The aircon appeared to have been preset and was not adjustable (at least not in my room) it was set at 23 degres celsius, but the room itself was not stuffy as a result. The bathroom was fine, the shower was great with a good high pressure head. The towels were a bit on the thin side, but they did the job.

They also made an effort to remember me and follow up on previous enquiries I had. I only ate breakfast there, but I found that fine. Standard hotel faire but perfectly edible. Prompt and friendly service from the restaurant staff meant my coffee cup was rarely empty. Whilst the address of the hotel is Eu Tong Sen Street, the entrance is on Havelock square which is off the main road. Taxi drivers are not mad keen to go down there as it means they can get stuck at a set of lights onto Havelock road getting back out. As a results a few drivers dropped me off not at the entrance but on the main road, not a hassle as it is only a 100m walk round the building to the entrance. By the way tell taxi drivers it is the Furama Chinatown as it is easier for them to get the right hotel. The location of the hotel is good as it is only a 10 minute walk to Clark Quay and Boat Quay, the centres of the bar and restaurant scene in Singapore. Chinatown is good also for Hawker stalls (cheap and good food) and a bit of shopping, though for the latter head to Orchard Road. If asked would I stay there again, I would say yes.", "Date": "October 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cEnjoyable if you want to be in Chinatown\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR5476528", "Content": "The Furama CC is near the major attractions of Chinatown but it is not in the middle of things as other reviewers mentioned. Our room was really nice with huge windows. The room was recently renovated and included a fridge. Our bathroom had a nice sized shower and a separate tub. The water pressure was amazing! We received coupons for a welcome drink which was a nice touch. The MRT is really close and cabs are easy to find in the area of the hotel. Cons: The concierge was useless!!!! They could not handle even basic questions like \"where can I find live music in Singapore\". Breakfast was decent, just nothing to write home about.", "Date": "July 17, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, CA", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel - Great Location\u201d", "Author": "rfpst1", "ReviewID": "UR5428292", "Content": "I've been staying at the Furama two or three times a year since 1997 and have never had a bad experience. From my perspective, it is the perfect hotel in which to recover from the jet lag after the long flight from LA. There is a great outdoor swimming pool and a small but perfectly usable gymnasium. Last time I was at the Furama, in December of 2005, my room was not ready when I arrived, so they put me in what I assume was the Presidential Suite for the night...full kitchen and two bathrooms etc. The staff has always been accommodating and helpful. The restaurants are great as well. On the rare occasion that I stay with friends while in Singapore, I always make it a point to stop at the Furama's coffee shop for a cheese sandwich and tomato soup...a little bit of home in Singapore. Did I mention that it is a three minute walk to Chinatown and the MRT? Overall, a great hotel, great location, and great price.", "Date": "July 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cAnother enjoyable stay\u201d", "Author": "ariane123", "ReviewID": "UR5417556", "Content": "This was my second visit to the Furama City Centre, the first being in 2003. I'm pleased to say that it was still very good value and lived up to expectations, although the Happy Hour is now nowhere near as good as it used to be! This time we chose a room on the Executive Floor and I'd say that we had a bit more space than in the Deluxe room. We also had access to the Executive Lounge at all hours, and it was nice to be able to make coffee/tea and eat home made biscuits and also to partake of the hors d'oeuvres between 6 and 8. As always, we thought that the room was kept very clean and the bathrobes were big and comfy. I love the walk-in showers and choice of toiletries as well. The MRT is just around the corner, and taxis are really cheap for us Brits (used to London prices!) so we used both to get around Singapore. The staff were friendly and even made a birthday cake for my mother (free of charge) when they realised it was a special occasion. Just to note that the electrical shop next door sells big, and cold, bottles of water very cheaply so you can stock up there (tell him \"the British lady who hates football\" sent you!). We would most definitely stay here again.", "Date": "July 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rome, Italy", "Title": "\u201cNot the pick of Singapore\u201d", "Author": "beach_specialists", "ReviewID": "UR5383478", "Content": "The hotel is about 20 minutes by taxi from the airport however the MRT station is 50m away. It is only a short walk to the Singapore River area, however, after our previous stay at Swissotel Merchant Court this hotel is definately a lower standard rating. The hotel requires renovations. The pool area was unloved so we welcomed the news that work would be done as it was a shame for the great location this hotel has. We took advantage of the Executive Floor package. However, it was not what we expected. Our stay at the hotel had us only meet another couple using the lounge at the same time. The view was great from the E.F. lounge but that would be the only bonus. The breakfast had a small buffet available. Our room was okay, the bathroom was not the best and really felt as if it was a standard room.
