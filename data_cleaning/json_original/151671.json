Beach chairs were set up on 4 or 5 concrete slabs covered with green astroturf that was ripped and stained, lots of disgusting trash on the beach. We headed back to our room and checked out, drove 2 hours back to Fajardo to hotel we had stayed in first few days of vaca with nice beach and blue waters. Concierge was out sick. Executive lounge was only open til 9 AM, limited offerings if you are used to Hiltons in the states, disappointing.

This was our first time staying in Ponce and we were a bit apprehensive but no longer. When we first arrived at almost 3 a.m. our first experience was that we got lost driving from the airport to hotel. The GPS for some reason took us to the Plaza Caribe Mall and not to the hotel. I called and spoke with Victor at the front desk who guided me over the phone on how to get to hotel. That was awesome! Victor assigned us our room # 548 and we proceeded to bed since we were extremely tired. When we awoke a few hours later, we found that the room was NOT to our expectations. The floor was dirty and the chair was dingy and torn, not to mention that it was next to the ice machine and elevator. I went to the front desk and spoke with Hugo and explained that I wanted to have my room changed. He nonchalantly told me that they only had king beds available. We needed doubles and I told him so but he apologized and told me that king was the only option. I asked him for the Manager's name and their business card. After breakfast I went back to the front desk intending to speak with the Manager but spoke with Jose instead. This is when it all became awesome! Jose asked me for a couple of hours to see what became available after check out. He changed our room and we were provided with free breakfast, free tee-shirts and a pizza for our inconvenience. Jose made a huge difference in my expectations of how hospitable front desk staff should be. He should be commended!! Our stay was wonderful and I would highly recommend the Executive Tour, 5th floor, it has a spectacular view. I hope that the hotel will clean up room 548 and change out the chair for the next guest.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Islip, New York", "Title": "\u201cREALLY NICE RESORT AND THEY ACTUALLY GIVE FOR THE BIG RESORT FEE!\u201d", "Author": "KGIRL02", "ReviewID": "UR127811838", "Content": "We really liked this hotel. All the resorts charge a 18% Resort Fee on top of regular taxes. However, the resort fee usually doesn't give hardly any extras. The Hilton is different, we received a free large breakfast buffet, 2 free t-shirts, free drink coupons, $20 towards the casino, 3 free ice cream tickets, discount to the spa, and a free large pizza. Most resorts let you pay a lot for all these sacks and extras while you are at the pool. They also kept giving me free diet cokes and seltzer at the bar. There are also free bicycles to ride around the resort, play tennis, ping pong, and games, all no charge. The staff was really nice and helpful. Also, we had to leave at 3:00 AM for the airport so the staff made food boxes for all of us with sandwiches, fruit, water, and treats. Very Nice thing to do. Parking very reasonable, $8 day. Nice Pool with lots of seating and shaded areas. Quiet, but nice mix of people, with many from Puerto Rico who gave great recommendations about the Island.

We were looking for a quiet getaway and we got it. If you want a fast paced casino and beach experience, stay in San Juan and pay a fortune. If you want tranquility, golf, beautiful pools and ocean and a staff that is truly glad you are there, go to the Hilton Ponce Golf & Casino Resort. I suspect most complaints are because the guests were expecting plush urban American facilities. We got a great price for unlimited golf and breakfast. The rooms were great - tile floors, very comfortable beds and quiet, except for the ocean and birds. We loved it. In fact, we wish we were still there. We played about 36 holes of golf every day and had the wonderful golf course almost to ourselves. We went in to Ponce often for dinner and exploring. It was a lot of fun. The golf staff was fantastic. For that matter, all the resort staff were superb. Sancho's Sushi Bar was the only disappointment - food was not good and prices were too high. Coming from San Francisco and Washington DC we have great sushi restaurants. Sancho's could use a rehab. The La Cava restaurant was excellent - food was delicious and properly prices. The waiting staff were fantastic. The La Terraza restaurant was our morning oasis - an outdoor breakfast by a lagoon filled with fish and turtles, plus a great view of the ocean and the pool. What a great way to wake up every morning. The beach is not an idyllic beach, but it is a typical Caribbean beach. I recommend snorkeling on the reefs with Caribbean Images Tours (http://www.caribbeanimagespr.com/caribbeanimagespr.com/Welcome.html) . David Mansfield and his first mate Jorge are great guides. You'll have a fun and safe ecotour of the nearby reef. The 27 hole golf course is fairly new and a stern test when the winds come up in the afternoon. There's plenty of water so bring lots f balls for your first few rounds. Once you get your club selection and routing figured out you will be OK. A few fairways are a little rough due to either too much or too little water, but don't hold that against them. The bunkers were pretty much unplayable, but who cares. Take a drop and have fun. There are lots of birds and iguanas to entertain you along the way. The exercise facility is too small for the size of the facility and could use an expansion and equipment upgrade.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Morristown, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Base for south Puerto Rico vacation\u201d", "Author": "SmulchY", "ReviewID": "UR127314025", "Content": "Our family of three just spent a great 5 nights an this resort. We had just spent a pretty disappointing first night in San Juan, and the beautiful drive south and the final arrival at the grounds of this very nice hotel were all we needed to revive our general worry that we weren't going to like PR. The grounds are beautiful here, the staff is all very friendly and helpful. Our 9 year old loved the pool and the other activities available at no charge (you pay a daily resort fee in addition to your hotel room though). The concierge was very helpful and knowledgable about local dining and activities and helped us schedule some of these. However, after the first few days it seems she was off and there was nobody to replace her - too bad. The beaches here are not really great, but the southwest corner of the island is said to have some of the most beautiful and they are within two hours drive. Unfortunately, we just didn't have time to get there. But there is plenty to do within an hour of this location. Historic Ponce seems to offer some things, but aside from some great restaurants we didn't venture there and don't honestly feel we missed much. Some cautions: - There are a number of additional fees you will pay attached to your room: Resort fee, parking fee, state and city taxes. For us, it added about $40 per night to our cost. - The attached golf resort offers some additional activities that include kayak, sunfish, and hobiecat rentals. I tried to rent a sunfish but the woman in charge (the only one that didn't speak English - or pretended not to- in the whole resort) told me it was too windy. I am not sure how they measure this, but I've sailed before and it was not. She only offered the kayaks which honestly if it was so windy would be completely unappealing anyway. None of the sailing boats were rigged and in the days we were there I never saw one taken out. I suspect that either the resort or this woman are completely uninterested or unable to rig them and so just use the wind as an excuse. - I noted one comment from a reviewing that it is a slightly windy location. When were there we had a beautiful breeze that comes in off the water all day - it starts very light in the morning, and picks up some speed by mid-afternoon, but I would say it was no more than 10 knots. The advantage of this was to keep the rain in the beautiful mountains to the north, which are visible from the hotel. - Some of the rooms closest to the common area can be noisy, even with the single-pane glass sliding doors closed. On weekends this can be especially unpleasant for a family that isn't in to the night life and needs there sleep. So try to get the higher numbered rooms. - Also, on the subject of room noise: the floors are all tile on concrete. Every room has a patio/deck with furniture that when moved even slightly can be heard loudly in the nearby rooms. In all, we had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend it for travelers of all types.", "Date": "April 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "COLUMBUS", "Title": "\u201cQuiet in southwest PR\u201d", "Author": "Annaplois", "ReviewID": "UR127213290", "Content": "Stayed @ Hilton in Ponce 4 nights in March.

Note if you want to kayak one needs to do this early in the morning...like 7 am...due the waves and currents, just organize it with the desk the day before. Notes on location: drive into Ponce, and hit the center of town. Some good little eateries, the striped firehouse and King's Ice Cream across from the firehouse. We took a road trip to La Parguera to see the luminescent bay area...it is a faded glory due to pollution, but it was only $6...you get what you pay for but it was still interesting. Warning on driving from Ponce...have a VERY good map. We were told a 20 minute drive...1 hour and 20 mins later we got there on back roads with horses, cows, iguana and a very narrow road in some places. Slow and white knuckle driving to get back....warning...have a good map and frankly a map won't help in town...just follow the flow of people.

I've read people complain about the rocks, but here's a tip...if you look hard enough... You can find seaglass in those rocks, which I think is pretty awesome... And i've already collected a large handful! 2. The pool is beautiful and well kept... It does have a lot of palms, but there are areas to lay in the sun! We haven't yet been to the pool at the golfncourse, but we may try that tomorrow! 3. We've eaten at El Bohio... The poolside bar. Delish! We just had an appetizer sampler and some drinks, but it was great and reasonable (in my opinion)... Their local beer is great! Light and refreshing! 4. We have a rental car... So we made a trip to the supermarket and picked up beer, water, sandwich stuff and cokes! Prices are pretty comparable to the continental US! 5.

We did, and after one night we asked to be moved. We were moved to a room in the West Tower which was actually a much nicer room. The Executive Tower room had a great view, but the shower was awful, we were too far away from the actual lobby and restaurants, and the daily \"reception\" in the Tower lounge is a joke. Not worth the extra money. 2. Don't expect to walk on the beach at night as there is a fence around the property that is locked at 6pm for security purposes. Not a huge deal but would have been nice to know before we went, or at least alerted to this when we checked in. On the plus side, the food was excellent in the resort restaurants, and the pool and grounds are gorgeous.

The beach, not so much. This hotel is 1.5 hours from San Juan - which is approx. $300 roundtrip fare via taxi/car service. We were going with another couple and didn't really do our research on this location. I think we should have stayed in San Juan as far as bars/restaurants/things to do, etc. We wanted to zip line, but that was an hour cab back toward San Juan, so we decided to pass. There is really nothing to do in the area that is close. We went into town and saw the Old Firehouse and The Boardwalk - waste of time. Service at the resort was good at the front desk and with the concierge. Clemente drove us to the other pool one day, very nice and spoke good English. The rest of the staff at the pool bars, etc had trouble with English which made asking questions about menu items difficult- there is another pool near the golf course which we found to be better than the main pool. You can't see the ocean from the main pool and there are a lot of trees which block the sun. We were in the Executive Tower, which had a nice ocean view and great balcony. Executive Lounge is lacking as others have mentioned...cerial and sandwich items - that's about it. Also, was not stocked well. It is also closed on Sat/Sun, but ask for breakfast vouchers and you can get the full breakfast on the weekend...we would have not known if I hadn't called. You would think they would have given us the vouchers at check-in, but no, had to ask for them. there is a Managers Reception on Thursday nights - found out about that by accident too - but there were nice appitizers and rum drinks. The rooms were clean, but had trouble getting towels, etc. restocked. I guess the main problem I had with the place was, for the price, we expected better service. They knew we were there over the weekend, we should have had breakfast vouchers in our packet at check-in, along with information about the reception on Thursday night, etc. Also, there is no waiter service in the pool area - that would have been nice. It seems they cater more to weddings and conventions than regular hotel guests. I don't mind paying high prices when on vacation, but I expect to be treated like they're happy we're here, which didn't seem to be the case at this hotel.

She used a reputable local flower shop that put together an amazing arrangement for not that much money. Everything at the hotel was awesome until Sunday morning. My wife and I had planned to sleep in a little late and relax in the room. However, promptly at 8:00 a.m., we were startled awake by the sound of BLARING music. The music was so loud, we could barely hear each other speak. My wife called the front desk to make them aware of the situation, but the music continued. After about one hour of this, my wife stepped outside the room to see what was going on. The only thing she could see were other hotel guests standing outside trying to figure out what was going on. We couldn't see who was playing the music or why, but it was clearly coming from over-sized, industrial strength set of speakers that are used at an outside concert. We finally decided to get up and dressed by 10:30 a.m. and went to breakfast. The music continued to blare. When we went outside, we noticed that some sort of politically rally was in progress and was the source of the music. The music continued until we decided to leave (around 12 noon). I'm not sure why they decided to have the rally blare music beginning at 8a.m. on a Sunday, nor do I no why the hotel did not provide us guests with a fore warning, but it did put a cloud over an otherwise wonderful weekend at a very nice hotel.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Michigan", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Vacation Resort\u201d", "Author": "jkfhope", "ReviewID": "UR124708970", "Content": "This was our second visit to Puerto Rico and my husband I wanted to stay somewhere other than the San Juan area.

The pool is large and the area around it has a nice mix of shade and sun. The beach was nice (it is public), but not as nice as what we are used to on Lake Michigan, so we mainly stayed by the pool. The lobby was alittle dated, but we don't go on vacation to spend time in the lobby! The outdoor areas and rooms were very nice, so that is all that really mattered to us. Although we did not take advantage of it, it did seem like they had lots of activity options for families. There is a mini golf course, playground, tennis and basketball courts as well as other games. I could definitely see us returning once my husband and I start a family because I think kids would have lots to do there. The food in La Cava was excellent. It is a bit pricy, but worth it for a nice dinner. We were there over the super bowl and our service in La Terraza during the game was horrible, but they were busy. The food there and from the pool bar is mediocre. Since you pretty much have to have a rental car due to the location I would highly suggest eating most meals outside the resort to save money and have increased quality. (I will be reviewing area restaurants we ate at as well) La Cava is really the only one worth the money you pay. If you can stay over a Thursday I would highly recommend it, because they do have a manager\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s reception with free drinks and appetizers, which were all great.

My husband and I along with our 4 year old twins had a blast! The amenities and catering they did for not only adults but for children is what makes it the perfect place for us! Happy Children makes happy parents! The wonderful staff which made our trip Feb 2011 worthwhile at this resort! Right on the beach yet very secluded and peaceful is also why we picked this resort! Alejandro Breban - This man is the epitome of Customer Service. He made us feel like we were family at your hotel. He always had a smile on his face and a cheerful demeanor. To let you know, he would go out of his way to make sure my family and I always had a wonderful breakfast. Even the little things he did, like bring my children a plate of fruit or juices, really showed his dedication and his professionalism. We believe he should be moved up whithin your executive ranks. Hopefully there will be spot for him somewhere within your organization with a big office someday. Jose Caquias - Jose would either be at the Executive Lounge or at the front desk. On our first day of checking in and going to the Executive Lounge he was there and he remembered us from a year ago. Again, nothing but a professional in all he did. Always courteous and well informed. Even when he was dealing with some unruly guests in the lounge, he always kept his cool and smiled the entire time. He showed attentiveness to the customers needs and went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect within the lounge. John Maldonado - I will be shocked to hear he was one of your waiters because the way he presented himself and acted you would believe he was management. Either way a constant professional and knows how to treat and speak to people on vacation. In a conversation with him, he told me he treats people like he would want to be treated when on vacation. Jessica (last name unknown) - This young lady was one of the waitresses for the outside bar and pool area. I don't think my wife and I have ever had such great service from a server. She was very quick on bringing our drink and food orders and always had a wonderful smile on her. Even when she was the only one working the pool she never wavered on her service. Great Job. There were also others but these four stood out amongst them all. Just love this place and we hope you will too!

I thought about updating my review, many great things have happened since I arrived in 2008 but I read some other reviews first. I was concerned about the mention of bugs at the Hotel. There are bugs everywhere in Puerto Rico, yes and the iguanas are green and beautiful until they eat all the fruits on your trees. Going back to the BUG issue, I think I can clarify that they do not have bed bug at the hotel. But if you are itching all over that can be true. In an effort to make your stay at the hotel memorable, some time ago the hotel upgraded their pillows and duvet covers to down feather inserts. I am allergic to feathers so when the change was made I asked to keep the synthetic materials. At times when I have left and returned for another long stay, months at a time I have forgotten about the change and the first night can be an agony. Earlier this year I forgot about the change and actually ended up going to the doctor, when he mentioned allergy I remembered the feathers. Now I call ahead before I arrive and request that the bedding be changed, which they do and actually write it down on your reservation, they take these matters seriously. So for those of you who thought it was bed bugs you might have an answer here, and if you are allergic to feathers and are planning on coming to the hotel let them know ahead of time. Now for the new review. The hotel has upgraded many rooms; the gym got excellent new equipment with individual TV\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s while you exercise or music. The restaurants keep changing menus to make choices more inviting. The lunch Kriollisimo at Costa Caribe is excellent and the prices are reasonable. Breakfast with Jimmy at the Terraza Breakfast Buffet is fantastic, if you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see what you want, ASK! They aim to please. Eggs Benedict, Cappuccino, Salmon\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The Executive Lounge has introduced a different International experience every evening of the week. La Cava Restaurant for when you want to splurge and enjoy a great evening is still a great choice. If not just stay in your room and order room service all the restaurants deliver, and no it will not break your piggy bank. The Staff is Number one. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that lightly, from the moment you enter the Hotel the people at the parking counter, bell hops, main desk, housekeeping, grounds keeping, pools, restaurants, executive lounge, turn down service in the evenings, \"Gabriel Lara loves you!\", too many to mention them all, are happy, friendly great people waiting to make your stay the best ever. I wish to thank Mareldys Rodriguez as a representative of all the wonderful people that work at this hotel I call my home. ***They will call for taxi service to Airport or elsewhere.

The beach was beautiful and there were many pools as well to play in. Didn't get a chance to spend any time doing this, but imagine it would be fantastic.

I seek out the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153wow\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd experiences and I encourage you to view hotels I have stayed at and their respective reviews (by clicking on my name). LOCATION: Nothing within walking distance but 3 restaurants and a casino on property. On a mediocre at best beach. TYPE OF ROOM: \u00e2\u20ac\u00a8\u00e2\u20ac\u00a8OceanFront BED/SHEETS/PILLOW: Bed was comfortable and had better than average linens. Pillows were too thick and were not down. LIGHTING: Adequate in room/bathroom. BATHROOM/SHOWER: Definitely in need of remodeling. Shower had great water pressure and hot water. TOILETRIES: CrabTree (Typical Hilton products) CLEANLINESS: Room was very clean. A/C: Worked well STYLE OF ROOM: Zero style, COMMON AREA: Pool is ok/good, basketball court, tennis court, mini-golf, 3 restaurants, 3 bars. Good for a quick stroll, perhaps and excellent for kids. In definite need of remodel. QUIET/MORNING LIGHT: Room is quiet and curtains block out the morning sun. FOOD: We ate at the executive lounge which is complimentary for certain guests. At night there are softdrinks, coffee, rum, vegetables, and chicken skewers. In the AM, there are English muffins, breads, and cereals. TV/INTERNET: TV is not a flats creen and quality of picture was below average. There were many channels and the internet was complimentary and fast. SERVICE: People were friendly but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask for any special requests. SUMMARY: We checked out the Ramada as well which is in the historic area of Ponce and a much smaller, more of a boutique hotel.

It dont think is a under or over price it is price right. Staff- overall very good. The valet attendants were awsome. (Neftali, Joshua and Jose were the ones that went above and beyond to answer any questions and were more like concierges than just valet attendants.) Restaurants- La Cava is very nice and definitely a must visit. La Terreza was great for breakfast (A little overpriced at 20 bucks a person i would have thought it was worth 12-14 but was still good.) For dinner it was ok but i would definately go outside the resort for dinner unless i was going to eat at La Cava. Lastly but not least the restaurant at the golf course was great for lunch, i wish i would have hit that for lunch more on my stay. I didnt try the sushi restaurant at the golf course but wished that i had. Grounds- The beach was ok and the pool was great. They have things to do putt putt, ping pong, basketball courts, volleyball and playgrounds for kids. Great fitness center. The golf course- Awesome. I mean great value great course friendly staff. Overall this is a four+ star resort that is great. I would go back there tommorrow if I could.

Rooms have a tropical decor which was nice. The next day, Moises at the front desk was very helpful in suggesting a place where we could have lunch in Ponce and his recomendation of La Casa del Chef was great! We tried Mofongo and although the food was luke warm to cold, it tasted good! He was very helpful with directions and anything else that we needed. The second night the people above us had 6 kids in their room running around and being very noisy on their patio so we called the front desk and asked if they could help and they moved us to a higher floor. The front desk staff that evening was extremely helpful and very willing to accomodate us, and they did. We decided to order room service this evening and Lores was so nice and friendly! Our dinner was great that night! On our 3rd day we got notice on our door that we would have to move rooms again because a group had already blocked the floor we were on. On this day, the front desk agent was not very helpful. We asked why we weren't notified sooner about this and she kept saying, \"I have a deal for you. . \" Well, it wasn't a deal because they first moved us to a smoking room even though the resort is non smoking. After heading back to the front desk and \"talking\" to the same front desk agent, we finally got upgraded to the Executive Tower and this room had an amazing view of the ocean and updated decor. That evening we ate at La Terraza, which is their buffet style restaurant and the food was amazing! They had a seafood buffet that included, Grouper, Crab, Oysters, Paella and Prime Rib to name a few things. Overall, aside from the front desk agent on the third night, the staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. They truly want to make you feel at home and comfortable.

This trip had us at 3 Hilton properties and a villa on Culebra. Check in was a breeze. I did not have my reward certificate but they did the extra work to get the numbers they needed. We had a ground floor room in the Executive Tower (152). The rooms are decorated very nicely with all of the Hilton expectations met but with island flair. The patio is very welcoming and private despite the proximity to neighboring rooms. The rather large bathroom has a shower only but with both a large overhead shower and a handheld available. The neighboring resort, Costa Caribe has a beautiful 27-hole golf course and a separate clubhouse. Free shuttles are available to get to that resort. The pool at Costa Caribe is much less busy when the Hilton is full of families. Costa also has Hobie Cats, Sunfish sailboats and kayaks for rent. The Hilton itself has basketball, tennis, mini-golf, bicycles and ping-pong to go along with the pool scene. The pool has lots of chairs but still can get crowded on busier weekends such as Easter when we were there. Then again, EVERYWHERE is busy on Easter week in Puerto Rico. If that will be an issue for you, I would not travel to PR during the Easter break. The pool area also has many towering palms to help shade you from the sun if needed. The swimming beach is not spectacular. Darker sand and some reef make swimming less inviting. The Hilton does provide chairs in the sand for free both at the beach and within their gates in a nice sandy area complete with a playground. There are other beaches nearby with better conditions. If beach is your primary reason, this may not be the location for you. We are beach people though and found other places to have that experience such as Playa Santa, the beach at Cabo Rojo (salt flats and lighthouse) and the fun at Gulligan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Island. The Hilton is also very near the Bioluminescent Bay of La Parguera (also known for great Sangria)! DO THE BIO BAY! $6 on West Divers (ask for Junior if you speak English) also gives you the chance to get in the water and try it out. It is an experience you will not forget. If you have a GPS, bring it! It was invaluable in finding the places away from Ponce. Some reviews have suggested that concierge was not very helpful or always around. We did not experience this but found that the guys working at the valet stand had plentiful information and were exceedingly friendly! Neftali was particularly great and always found time to help us find somewhere to go! If you are allowed to use the Executive Lounge, do so! The breakfast is great and the free cocktails and appetizers at night are also fantastic. Free rum drinks there cost me $11 at the El San Juan (Waldorf Astoria). NOTE: See the review of mine for there also - ESJ is a horrible place! Non beach attractions include nearby Ponce Square, which is very neat offering a $2 tour of Ponce and others said the coffee plantation tour was very good! Lastly, the main restaurant was our place for breakfast on the weekend. The open-air restaurant is very nice but can get very busy on weekends. They do add extra buffet stations to accomodate and I found the buffet/omelet service to be adequate given the volume of people served. Service is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153island speed\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. It could be better but reflects what I have come to expect throughout Puerto Rico. The cost of the restaurant is a bit high in my opinion. $20 for breakfast is high (despite being free for us as Diamonds). If not free for us, I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pay that much. Dinners are much more expensive. Frankly in Puerto Rico, the best, most inexpensive food is found at locations along the edge of the highway. Coming from the US, that does not appeal to many but in PR, it is the best food we ate! Overall, we will most definitely stay again at the Hilton Ponce. The deviation from San Juan and the service given here exceeded my expectations.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGood service - beach not the best\u201d", "Author": "borntoexplore", "ReviewID": "UR60950187", "Content": "We first were tempted to leave upon our arrival.

This was not the worste stay ever at a hotel, but not my favorite! Here's the goods and bads: Goods: Location is amazingly beautiful, but pretty far from San Juan airport. The pool deck looks just like the pictures online. The view from our room (the cheap room) was outstanding. There was one waiter (Izac) who was friendly and one manager (Angel Hernandez) that was helpful when we were having a particularly hard time getting some lunch. Downtown Ponce has a trolley tour that only costs $2 (and for 2 dollars is was pretty good). Our trolley driver was very funny! It was easy to park at the Hilton and the beach towels were pretty big and soft. The lounge chairs at the beach were greatly appreciated and used daily! The breakfast buffet looked pretty good. I ordered eggs Benedict one day (as I don't eat enough buffet for the cost) and it took 1/2 an hour and my eggs were almost hard boiled they sat around so long. The strawberry daiquiri is very delicious at any time of day, however. The tuna wrap was pretty good and we ordered it a few times (although it was supposed to come with guacamole and it never did. I assume they were out, but a waiter should have said that when we ordered). Bads: There was not once when the food service was good! Over done food that took half an hour or more to bring out (even if we were the only ones waiting) was the norm. If there are spanish speakers around we found they ALWAYS got served first, even if your order was taken first. Waiting 15-20 minutes for a waiter to even acknowledge you was the norm. Several times I was at the bar and the bar tender would go around to all the spanish speakers before me, even if I came first. It often seemed as if the staff didn't really want to be working and they were taking it out on the patrons. My husband and I have been to jamaica several times and we understand island time, but taking an hour for a fruit salad and then not understanding why I get upset when it doesn't come is a little ridiculous! (By the way when the bar tender asked the waitress, who was talking, where the fruit salad was she gave him some attitude, rolled her eyes and walked away to talk with her friend a few feet away). At one point the credit card machines were down and my husband (and the rest of the army boys, we were there with the army) had to get to a meeting. Instead of telling us the machine was down the restaurant took the credit card and just held onto it for twenty minutes. When someone asked if they could get their card back because they had to get to a meeting, the waiter said no. He was going to hold onto the credit card for hours. This might have been an ok option if they had asked but just taking the card and not telling us what was going on was deceitful! We asked them the put the charge on our room and give back the card but they acted like we were asking them to move heaven and earth (I guess it's a lot of work to put something on the room). I try to be polite, but I feel like it was fairly one ended. We went to the casino one night and along with comp. drinks there was grilled cheese. We saw a bunch of spanish speakers going up to the waitress and grabbed sandwiches that were stacked up. (They people had just walked in so I don't think they pre-ordered). When my husband and I walked up and asked for one, the waitress turned away from us and walked the other way without saying a word. Also, bring your own sun screen! A 3 oz container of SPF 35 cost 13 dollars!! And don't ask the ladies in the gift shop for any help, they will only give you attitude and big sighs. The concierge was helpful in the sense that he gave us a map to get to downtown, but suggested nothing to do/ see/ or eat while down there. I often felt like I wanted to apologize for asking the staff to answer basic questions or bring out food. I understand it was hot and they didn't want to move fast, but I always say please and thank you and I don't think I deserved all the sighs and eye rolling that I got. It was exactly like telling my teenager to clean her room. The beach did not have the Caribbean clear water that we are used to and it was really rocky for the first five feet, but the waves were safe to play in for the kids. You did have to watch for big rocky wholes in the sand under the water that could cut up your feet but we soon learned where they were and were able to avoid them! I was fairly on my own with a teenage daughter because my husband was in P.R. with the army and although the army told me that everyone in P.R. speaks some english I did not find that to be true. We were very glad when we moved on to San Juan for the next portion of the trip!!", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cOn Beach Beauty and Quality Rooms\u201d", "Author": "WorldAdventurer_7", "ReviewID": "UR56716777", "Content": "This is what I expect from a Hilton (not that I always get it).

The staff was very accommodating when we didn't particularly care for the location of our room and immediately gave us a first level patio with ocean view that was just above the pool area. We could walk out to the pool, tiki bar, beach rather than do the hallway through the hotel. Great location. The room was of generous size and the room decor was simple but adequate. The bedding was very comfortable. Housekeeping did a great job. The food was better than we expected with three types of dining; fine dining restaurant that was moderately pricey, casual beach/bar/tiki bar restaurant serving sandwiches and typical bar food, and a regular dining room with daily specials for dinner. Their salad buffet was awesome!!! Many choices and really very good. The grounds are beautiful with many palms offering lots of shade and plenty of lounges, tables and chairs. Although we didn't participate, there are bikes for use, small put-put golf course, and a lovely pool. Since it was a holiday, there were many families most of which seemed to be Puerto Rican. The beach was lovely and well maintained with several umbrellas. That area is locked during the evening for probable security purposes......keep intruders out and keep guests in. There were lots of youngsters in the pool, but we didn't see any misbehaviors. Since we are empty nesters, we would probably not reserve at this resort again during the holidays since it is too family friendly for our taste. The New Year parties rocked with two awesome live Latin bands that kept the music going the entire night. Our only problem with that was the noise level...it was ear splitting. We got the impression that many of the resort guests were actually Puerto Rican as compared to US or Europeans. They have a nice casino with typical gaming machines, several blackjack tables and a couple poker tables. We enjoyed that part of the resort, although the blackjack dealers are not as helpful or friendly as we found in other Stateside casinos. We did enjoy the fact that the entire hotel was smoke free due to the law that prohibits smoking in any and all public places. We only spent an afternoon in the city of Ponce, and it is a typical third world city with lots of color, noise, traffic and people. Due to the holiday, the museums were not open so we were not able to enjoy that cultural aspect. We had a slight billing problem, but it was resolved immediately upon our return Stateside.

Then we went on a one-day trip to San Juan and it was raining. Then on the flight back, it was raining again in San Juan. We stayed in Ponce 6 days and it DID NOT rain even once. The closest it got was a bit overcast in the evening one night. The breakfast is awesome! The other two restaurants at the resort are awesome! We had so much fun that we didn't even go to the Casino. We highly recommend this resort for anyone looking for a romantic getaway or with a family with kids.", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. John's, Canada", "Title": "\u201cNice with its quirks\u201d", "Author": "Sibernewf", "ReviewID": "UR21517073", "Content": "I am staying here now on business and the place is a great area. For whatever reason the hotel is next to empty. I would imagine around 10% full which in a place this big seems like you are all alone. The hotel itself is clean and lots of things to do. The rooms are dated and the beds are hard but clean and large. Despite the low numbers booked in I was put way on the end of the resort and i almost feel like im the only one staying here. I asked to be moved but was told this is the only area with a king bed and the rest of the floors and rooms dont??? I never pushed it... Breakfast.... Interesting.... Food was great and I was enjoying some nice waffles and sausage when I noticed birds... La Terraza is kind of open air so you expect birds, but these were invasive. I saw a black bird land on the table and begin picking at the napkins then he left a \"white spot\" on the table. Staff walked by and didnt even flinch. 5 minutes later a couple left after finishing and the birds invaded the table. 6 - 7 birds fighting over bacon and toast. This was right next to my table so I had to get up and ASK them to clean off the table. Then as another man left to refill at the buffet they invaded his table, ate from the syrup cup, took something off a plate, and a waitress, get this... shooed the birds away, topped up his OJ and left. When he came back I told him to eat at another table... That is just dirty in my mind and the staff were numb to it. Sports bar staff are not outgoing. despite tipping well and trying to strike up a conversation they retreated to the other side and talked amongst each other. I can see that if they are busy but on a slow night I would think they would at least talk. They seemed to understand english enough. Beer is 6.00 with DonQ rum 3.00 during Happy Hour 5 - 7. I think it was DonQ, weak drinks at that rate. Funny thing was the regular rate drinks had twice as much alcohol. Pool area is great and the beach is nice.

And the best deal is to be upgraded to the Executive Tower -- which gives you access to the lounge with (2) computers (free) to check email, continental breakfasts, afternoon snacks, cold drinks, tea/coffee, and at 5:30 pm small sandwiches and crudites, at 7:30 \"desert\" and liquers. In the evening, the \"honor\" bar is quite reasonable -- $5 for a glass of wine. You could make some of your meals here from the snacks and certainly save on expensive sodas, etc etc. Plus the concierge person manning the desk there can assist with tourist info, restaurants, etc. etc. The hotel isn't perfect -- it took 2 days to find out about the valet parking set up -- we were stopping at the desk each time to get our ticket stamped. Nothing was actually every explained to us about their faciities or various options. We had to explore and learn on our own. And if you are with a family -- keep in mind that their double beds are barely larger than a single; okay for very small kids only. That being said -- the main pool is the one for families and children. If you are an older (or romantic) couple and wish a bit less noise, you can take the shuttle (from the front of the hotel) to the country club and use their hot tub and pool. They will ask you to register at the hut where you get your towels (and you're given a wrist band to wear) but during the day the place is so much calmer. At either location there is a very small black sand beach...nothing to write home about ; it might entertain you for a very short walk to find some shells or old pieces of polished glass but not to sit on (although there are a few chairs at each). Keep in mind that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for the shuttle to ever show up -- there's no set schedule. We only ate a couple meals at the hotel -- one lunch at the pool bar -- decent. Had the chicken fingers which came with fries (only $12) from the appetizer list. Sodas were around $3 each. The other meal we had was at the Sushi restaurant (not open everyday) at the country club part. This was just okay. A bit disappointing with limited selections but good for a change from fried foods and mofongos..and yes, expensive for the portions served. For kids -- there is the pool as mentioned, a playground area near the beach, and a small arcade area inside that was kept quite busy. For adults -- there is entertainment advertised on the weekends. Wasn't there then so no idea whether this is worth it or not. The casino is small but decent. Had variety of slots/machines and games. Wasn't very crowded or busy when we were there. The fitness room -- is decently equipped. Has the usual machines and is conveniently located near the main pool. You must be 18 to use machines. They have a spa/sauna == saw their signs but never had a chance to investigate. Did the two hour city tour (only one now available); you can drive up to see several other sites (may be next time) but didn't have the car at the time. Cab from downtown only cost $10 plus tip to Hilton. People at hotel basically quite friendly and helpful. Material distributed not always up to date, however, so do call (or have them call for you). Directions -- As in all of Puerto Rico, directions are horrible and not very accurate (even the Garmin GPS was off). You will be told go right and it's a left and vice versa. Allow yourself time to get anywhere you are going if this is the first time you're there.

We selected Ponce, due to its location on the Caribbean side of Puerto Rico. Overall, the hotel was clean, the staff was extremely accommodating, and we enjoyed our 6 day stay. It wasn't perfect in all respects, but setting proper expectations for the ages and interests of those in your travel party could help when deciding on this property. Below is a recap of our experiences. Staff- Excellent. Upon arrival, we were given a standard room in the Executive Tower. (2 double beds and a single person sofa bed -all in one room) for my husband and me and two 18 year olds teens. We booked a two room suite, so this was unacceptable. After much hard work from Rose Maria Alvarez, the hotel day supervisor, she rectified our situation and we were given side by side rooms. Kudos to her for recognizing the importance of honoring reservations, providing good customer service, and maintaining the loyalty of a Gold Hilton Honors member. We were also impressed by the valet staff that drove us to the Golf club each day, and the activities staff member at the club who helped us push our kayaks (and assist my nephew in getting back in). Food and Accommodation - Stay in the executive tower if you can. It is newer, and you have access to the Executive lounge. A continental breakfast was free each day, and they also had free drinks while you were in the lounge (sodas, waters, juices, etc.) The food at the hotel is average at best. Bar food at the pools, or two buffets (one at the hotel and one at the golf club). For lunch, the buffets are $22. We purchased a buffet discount coupon booklet that provided 10 lunch buffets @ $13 a piece. We would check out the items on the hotel buffet first and then decide if we wanted to ride over to the Golf Club buffet for another option. In general, the food and the view are better at the Golf club. RENT A CAR! We did, and ate dinner out near the mall in Ponce each night. It is about 5 miles away, but you'll want to leave the property as there is nothing else to do around the hotel. While there is a mini mart and gift shop on the property, we bought snacks, soda and water at a store near the mall. The rooms had refrigerators, and with sodas at $2.25 a pop at the hotel, you'll save some money. Activities - My husband and I planned to dive using a shop in Ponce and a shop in Guanica. Unfortunately, not enough divers for EITHER shop to go out, so no diving for us the entire week. This was extremely disappointing and bizarre for the Caribbean. My husband played golf at the resort on 2 days. I spent most of my time at the Golf club pool and beach, which is much nicer and quieter than the hotel pool and beach. Despite being on the Caribbean side of PR, the water is not crystal blue as you would typically expect if you've been to other Caribbean destinations. Sand is brown/gray. Not great, but ok. We also used the fitness center which has old equipment, but has everything you need from machines to free weights. In short, this was a relaxing break from work, but not the dive trip we had hoped for. The 18 year olds in our party struggled a bit. While there was tennis, basketball, table tennis, and the pools, they became somewhat bored after a few days. There are no planned activities (like volleyball games and other activities that you typically find at beach resorts). There seemed to be a lot of locals there that were part of a \"summer club\" and weren't too accepting of the guests. With nothing around the hotel to do either, they \"relaxed\" a lot. :) Despite this, we are not too hard to please and enjoyed the time away. I hope this information helps those reading to determine if this is the best setting for you.

We were in the executive tower which I guess is supposed to be exclusive. NOW, the very bad part: Perhaps due to the recent rains per a local (Ponce is on the leeward side of the island--drier and hotter) or not, but there was a horrendous mosquito invasion that could not be avoided even in the rooms. Despite heavy chemical spraying, they thrived loving the recessed door and patio areas of each room. Did I mention that Puerto Rico is closely monitoring an outbreak of dengue fever? We and others were running and flailing our arms and towels when going outside the rooms--remember all rooms are accessed from the exterior. It truly was horrible.

The rooms were clean, neat and a sort of modern decor. The open lobby invites you to stay and enjoy the ocean breeze.

I had stayed there once previously, also on business. It is a moderately attractive property -- an interesting, airy layout of the lobby and main restaurant lead out to the pool area, and from there to the beach. It's nice to sit in the restaurant and look at the Koi pond, the pool, and the palm trees. The food is OK, if a little expensive (about $38 for a dinner with one beer, including tip. $12 plus tip for the continental breakfast). The breakfast includes a nice variety of fruits, breads, pastries, meats, cheeses, and hot items such as eggs and pancakes. The rooms are nice, and large. The beds are comfortable. My only real complaint about the rooms -- poor sound insulation. One evening, a woman in the room below had a phone conversation, apparently with her balcony door open. The sound bounced off the concrete beams outside and back into my room. Even with my balcony door closed, I could hear (and understand) every word. It is perhaps fortunate that the place does not seem to get very crowded. (Based just on the two times I've been there.) There's never a wait for the restaurant. The beach is small, and sort of unattractive. The pool and surrounding play areas (volleyball, mini-mini-golf, basketball) are nice enough looking (I didn't use them). There's a huge excess of parking, yet they charge $4.50 per day for it ($10 if you valet-park). If you're in the west wing (as I was), the parking is closer than the valet desk, so you'll actually do less walking if you self-park. No HBO or other premium movie channel, but of course you can pay for movies. Some of my colleagues at work are residents of the Ponce area -- some of them grew up there.

The service is horrible and this is suppose to be a resort?? Tip #1 If you want a glass of water w/ your meal start asking for it early. It took exactly 4 request every time before I got one. 4 is the magic number. TIP #2 Prepare to have both of your room keys fail. Make sure you take both of them at all times because god forbid you get stuck outside of your room ...oh say about 12:00 at night because they will take thirty three minutes to send someone up to let you in. TIP#3 This is important. DO NOT plan on getting a buzz from any of the drinks mixed at the bars. Even though it \"appears\" that they are pour liquer into the drink take my advice and my 174.00 tab and go to the liquer store located just outside the guard gate (they will be more than happy to tell you where it is) and buy a bottle. Then purchase virgin drinks and add your own liquer. DO NOT expect to get good food here either and it is not inexpensive. Oh TIP#4 This one is for the women. If you are American be prepared. Apparently Puerto Rican women do not like American women EVEN THOUGH Puerto Rico is part of the United States. They treated my friend and I horrible. Tip#5 Unless you are from Manhattan or Tampa Bay you might just want to take a defensive driving course or get a prescription for Zanex. If you have never been to P.R you are instore for some of the worst drivers in the country. There are no white lines in the road. Yes that is right no lines therefore they are ALL OVER the place. I will never complain about New York drivers ever again. TIP#6 The final one. If you would like to blend in with the other drivers simply lay on the horn and just blow on through the red light or stop sign. Make sure your music is blarring so you can't hear anybody elses horns and you will be fine. BTW there is no service out on the beach so DO NOT EXPECT resort style service.

We've traveled all over the world and we all agree that this one of our best vacations in terms of relaxing at a beautiful hotel. I would highly recommend it to others. Some keys to a successful vacation here: 1) Pay the extra $20+/day to stay in the Executive Tower. It's worth it for entry into the executive lounge - free internet use, complimentary breakfast, all-day snack and drink availability. You may have to also be a Hilton Honored guest member to access the lounge; I saw a previous entry regarding that. My husband was, so I'm not sure. [Our room and bathroom were very modern and very clean. I am very particular and I was very impressed.] 2) Choose the pool that suits your needs. If you have young children, the pool at the main hotel will be fine - lots of activity and other kids. If you want a quiet, relaxing experience (which we did), choose the pool at the golf club. It's a 5-minute complimentary shuttle ride or drive your own car there (as we did). I have posted photos of this pool. Most days we had it all to ourselves. 3) Rent a car. We flew into the San Juan airport and drove approximately 1 1/2 hours to the hotel. The roads were very good. Major highway nearly all the way. Just like driving here on the mainland. If you're looking for day trips, two excellent ones are: 1) One hour drive west and then a $6/person boat ride to Gilligan's Island. White sand, shallow clear waters, swim and lounge among channels of mangroves. Fantastic and beautiful. Never experienced anything like this before. Boat to the island leaves on the hour, so you may want to plan your arrival time. 2) Two hour drive northeast to Puerto del Rey to take a boat day trip (10-3:30). We went with EastWinds for $69/person. It was wonderful. Stopped at two snorkeling spots - great fish, good for both novice and experienced snorkelers, friendly staff, clean boat, nice lunch all the rum punch you can handle. Well worth the money and drive time. After the boat trip, we had just enough time to visit the El Yunque Rain Forest in that area. We hiked the Big Tree Trail to see a waterfall. The hike is very aerobic, down to the falls and back up to get out. It took us 45 minutes roundtrip walking at a quick pace, only stopping briefly to look at the falls. You can take a dip if you want. If you go to El Yunque, enter at the main northern entrance (El Portal). As mentioned in a previous entry, the beach at the hotel is not that good. Supposedly there are excellent white sand beaches one half hour to the west, but we were so relaxed by the pool that we didn't feel the need to search out for anything more. My husband golfed. He liked the course. Discounts are available for afternoon golfing. The best deal from 2-4PM, $50 including club rental. We all got massages at the golf club. We've all had many before and this one was very good. The spa rates at the golf club are less expensive than at the main hotel. Try Calypso Night - Wednesday nights at the golf club pool - happy hour and outdoor dining to a live Calypso band. Outside of the hotel, we ate at Pito's Seafood, Mark's at Melia's and La Casa de Tias. All were about $130 for three with appetizers and a bottle of wine. All were good, but our favorite was Mark's - linens, candlelight, one of the best meals I've ever had, great presentation. Also good is the main hotel pool dining area - Island Oasis - casual dining, very good daily specials. All in all, a beautifully relaxing time.

However, first I think it would be helpful to say a few words about Puerto Rico in general and Ponce in particular. We visited Puerto Rico many years ago. In those days, Puerto Rico was very poor and frankly depressing. We chanced a trip back to San Juan about a year ago. I couldn't believe the difference. We have traveled extensively in Latin America \u00e2\u20ac\u201c our most recent trip being to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic, where they definitely don't have their act together. Puerto Rico is a clean, prosperous and safe place to visit. It is heads and shoulders above anywhere else in Latin America we have ever visited. In Puerto Rico everything works \u00e2\u20ac\u201c click, click, click. It is the only place in Latin America I know about where you can drink the tap water and eat the vegetables wihtout wishing you hadn't. You can trust the police. Bribes are not the tradition there. They use American money. Very good English is widely spoken. There were many times I could not hear a trace of an accent. It seems like nearly everyone drives a late model car. Both times we visited there, the weather was perfect \u00e2\u20ac\u201c low eighties in the middle of the winter. I saw no beggars on the street. American stores and restaurants are everywhere. You don't need a passport to get there. Our Sprint cell phones had free roaming there \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I can't tell you what a convenience that was. We could call each other when separated and our teenager when she wandered off. We could call businesses and have them tell us how to get there. Our teenager sat out on the balcony and talked to her friends back in the United States for hours. We liked our stay in San Juan a lot during our last visit. We stayed in the Hilton there as well, which we also liked a lot. We decided to go to Ponce and stay there for four days just to see something different. There were three of us \u00e2\u20ac\u201c two adults and a teenager. The only hitch we ran into is that we had booked a connecting flight from San Juan to Ponce on Cape Air with CheepoAir.com. We had an itinerary from CheepoAir that said we were booked on that flight. Cape Air stated that CheepoAir had canceled our flights \u00e2\u20ac\u201c something never mentioned to us and something we certainaly never ordered or agreed to. However, Cape Air said they could get us on that flight, but it would cost a lot, lot more than the advance purchase fare we had booked. I don't know who made the mistake, but I do tend to get little a suspicious of profitable errors. Anyway, it worked out just great. We declined and walked right down to Hertz. The rental for the car for four days, including tax, was $148, which was much less than the original air fare for the connecting flight for one person, let alone three. Except for a short stretch in San Juan, it was all turnpike (about $6 in tolls each way) and a lovely drive through rolling hills. It took less than an hour and a half. We arrived before our scheduled three hour layover in San Juan was over and we had the use of the car while we were in Ponce. The total gas cost was $28 for the round trip and our running around in Ponce. The hotel charged something like $5 a day to park there. Now to the Hilton Ponce. The bottom line is that we liked it. We stayed in a part of the hotel called the Executive Tower. You get a substantial discount on the room rate if you pay in full in advance, which we did. The room was spacious and clean. There were two double beds in the room. I wouldn't call the beds roomy, but they were adequate. We had a balcony that looked out on the ocean. There was a desk in the room. They wanted nearly ten dollars a day for a high speed internet connection. They had an Executive Center where you could get a free wireless connection. Swiping my room card at the door to get in would not work there, but the people on duty always quickly buzzed me in with a smile. The last evening I was there, however, the lady on duty told me that I had to be a Hilton VIP member to use that room. There was nothing on the door to that effect and I saw no mention of that in the guest guide in the room. While that rubbed me more than a little wrong, I have to say the lady was very apologetic and nice about it. The grounds were beautifully landscaped. However, Ponce is not a beach destination. The hotel did have a narrow beach, which did not have a life guard and suffered from some liter. The pool is very nice. The food, while a bit pricy, was outstanding. You can figure on about $35 a person for supper, after taxes, but before tip and about $25 a person for lunch. I don't think Ponce is famous for its restaurants. We ate at several guide book recommended restaurants in Ponce. They were okay, but the food at the Hilton had us spoiled. Most service personnel spoke English very well and they were very polite. Twice the maid forgot to leave coffee for the coffee maker in our room, but both times I called the front desk and a clerk showed up at our door almost at once with the coffee packs. Once the toilet stopped up. I called the front desk and a guy showed up in a flash to fix it. Everyone went out of their way to be friendly. Plenty of security. There are uniformed security guards wandering around all the time. Ponce has a nice little square downtown, surrounded by nice shops. It's hard to find a place to park there. I had to park the car a couple of blocks away and walk, but that wasn't much of a problem. They have some sort of a shuttle bus there to get around the downtown area, but we didn't use it. There is also a nice boardwalk along a harbor with several local restaurants close to the hotel. It's a nice place to go for a stroll, especially at night. We ate at one of the restaurants on the boardwalk, but it did not impress us. Ponce is a nice. well kept little town, but you run out of things to see pretty fast. It's worth a few trips into town, but we spent most of our time at the Hilton, where there is plenty to do. We arrived back to San Juan in our rental car hours before our mid-afternoon flight. We drove out to a part of San Juan called Condado for a leisurely lunch, which we enjoyed immensely. Condado is a tourist area in San Juan close to Old Town that has quite few really nice restaurants. It sure beats air port food, if you have the time and a car to get there. In short, I highly recommend Puerto Rico, Ponce, the Ponce Hilton and Condado in San Juan. I also recommend that you rent a car to drive to Ponce rather than taking a connecting flight.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat weekend getaway\u201d", "Author": "sinister27", "ReviewID": "UR6783082", "Content": "Perfect vacation for the rejuvenating effect.

The person that checked us in wasn't to helpful, granted we checked in at about 5:30am but he could of been friendlier. Other than that two thumbs up, the grounds of the resort are kept very well.

The golf area was very nicely kept they actually have residences on the grounds of the course its a 27 hole PGA course, which probably means they get funds from PGA to keep the place that clean. Quick tricks for you if you do decide to go for a short stay 1- Pack light take carryon luggage only 2- Rent a car even if its for 2 days its worth going out into town and looking around. Get the economy size car its cheap and it'll be enough to get you around. 3- Fork over the extra 30 bucks to stay in the executive rooms, this will give you acces to the executive lounge which includes a free continental breakfast and free drinks (non-alcoholic) and snacks throughout the day.

The adjacent Caribe golf course is a newer 27-hole track with 2 holes oceanside (#18 & #27) relatively flat, and unchallenging, unless the winds are up.

After reading some of the reveiws here, I was a little nervous but I ended up pleasantly surprised. We arrived at 7 AM and our room was not immediately ready, so we sat down there for breakfast. In the middle of breakfast, the receptionist came to our table to tell us our room was ready. I thought this to be great service. Another receptionist happily gave us perfect directions to a restauraunt in Ponce. If you are looking for a beach resort, this may not be the place, but for that matter I don't think anywhere in Ponce has nice beaches. The beach was nice enough to walk out there in the morning, put your feet in the water, enjoy the view, then go sit by the pool. The pool here is very nice. I sat there all day long with very easy access to tropical drinks. The hotel is open air, so you get a nice breeze whenever in the lobby and main restauraunt. The buffet was a little expensive ($22 for the lunch and $18 for breakfast), but there was plenty of options. If you are there around noon on a Friday, be sure to check out the fashion show...very awkwardly entertaining. The hotel was very clean. And the casino was reasonable. $5 blackjack and craps, $1 roullette. We rented a car and used there self parking, which was $4.50 a day. I thought it was a little crazy to charge for parking, but the $4.50 was better than the $10 for valet. Unless you are extremely lazy, there is no need for valet...the parking lot is right in front of the hotel. If I ever go back to Ponce, I will stay at the Hilton. But next time I'd be sure to bring my sticks in order to check out their golf course.", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madison, WI", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointed\u201d", "Author": "kelleysezwoh", "ReviewID": "UR5771602", "Content": "We stayed in Puerto Rico for over a week and stayed in three different hotels. The Hilton in Ponce was easily the worst hotel we stayed at on our vacation. Very similar to the super 8 we stayed at in Chicago before departing - but twice the price. We booked a king size bed and got two twins, we had ants, our bathroom was filthy - the vents had dust in them like they'd never been cleaned.....the door had to be slammed shut in order to shut all the way because the sliding track was messed up - and our light flickered - making it pretty much unusable. To top it off, this \"resort on the beach\" had a disgusting beach. Trash all over, yucky looking sand and no beach accomodations. This hotel is in DESPERATE need of a major update. Rooms are ugly, grounds are not well kept.....yuck. I would recommed that anyone interested go to Puerto Rico, it is GORGEOUS....but if we go again - we will stay in Fajardo and San Juan......but definitely not that Hilton in Ponce.", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Virginia Beach", "Title": "\u201cOkay But If You Want a Nice Beach This Is Not It.\u201d", "Author": "sagar33", "ReviewID": "UR5624411", "Content": "I booked Hotel on Priceline.

We were told ponce is beautiful. Let me say dont even bother checking out ponce waste of time. Very dry like dessert and dirty. The beach at the Hilton is horrible. We were told beach is black because the rivers empty out into that area. Very ugly beach. The resort is nice. Basketball, ping pong, tennis, nice pool, food on resort very expensive I guess thats why the Hiltons have money and I dont. Also after you pay for room. When you arrive and than check out you have on your bill $7.00 a day resort fee, $4.50 a day for parking or $10.00 a day for valet parking not including tips. And $9.95 a day if you want internet access. So it adds up pretty quickly. Overall nice Hotel.

I have no complaints regarding the property. The check-in process was flawless and the room was nice and clean. The first night we went to the boardwalk to eat. The drive took only 5 minutes. The next day we went to the town center for a tour, that was only a 10-15 minute drive away. Everything was very close with a rental car and the resort is nice enough to relax onsite during your entire stay. The food is pricey of course, but that's what you should expect at a resort. We never had to walk from the parking area to the hotel, since they always had a person waiting with a golf cart to give us a ride. We enjoyed the live music on Saturday and the quietness on Sunday. The beach isn't the best but we didn't spend time there anyway. Also be sure to take advantage of the (free) bicycles to tour the property and the 2 basketball courts for exercise. The gym was small but sufficient for vacation needs.
