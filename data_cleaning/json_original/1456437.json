You can't beat the location! It's close to everything and you walk out and immediately have options for tapas, wine, live music, really nice ambiance. The staff was very helpful with directions, calling cabs, exchanging $ for Euros, you name it. Breakfast was included and we were satisfied with the buffet: great coffee/ tea selections, yogurts, cheeses, cold cuts, breads, fruits and made to order eggs. I love the Europpean style breakfast and this one didn't disappoint. The king size bed and pillows are wonderful...they might seems too hard (bed) and too soft (pillow) but I had a great night sleep. There's a spa and workout room in the basement which looked very clean and relaxing, but I didn't have a chance to use it. Wifi is free and there's a minibar, iron in the room. Room size was good enough for a couple with two large suitcases and a carryon, remember it's Europe. The decor is modern contemporary which was nicely done, but yes some of the art pieces might need a little getting used to...not a big deal as some reviews allude to.

One of the reasons why I felt like at home may be that I am used to stay in Radisson BLU hotels (mostly in Scandinavia) and even though they might not be as exiting as some boutique hotels, you may be sure about overall quality and standards in Radisson hotels. Standard room was large enough, with sitting corner, work desk and very nice and clean bathroom. I liked the Nespresso coffee machine as I need first coffee immediately after waking up. In addition there are also water kettle, minisafe and terry slippers. On the basement floor the hotel has small pool area which may attract children. Our room was on 4th (and the last) floor and therefore had smaller windows than other floors. Despite the fact that room window was facing busy square the windows were absolutely soundproof \u2013 we didn\u2019t even hear the street construction works which started early in the morning. Also the door and walls were so soundproof that we basically felt like alone in this hotel (which definitely was not the case). In Radisson I love the fact that they also have international TV channels, so we were able to follow the news etc. Location of the hotel is perfect for visiting the main Madrid museums; Prado museum is just across the street and also everything else is within walking distance (main railway station Atocha, old city, Sol square etc). Our package didn\u2019t include breakfast and as it is quite pricey in Radisson hotels (21 EUR) we had the breakfast out hotel. There are 3 cafes right in the front of hotel and countless amounts of restaurants and cafes in neighbourhood, nearest Starbucks 300 m from hotel. You can easily get to the hotel from airport by Renfe local Train C1, which leaves Airport T4 after evey half an hour and takes you to Atocha in 25 minutes. Hotel is within walking distance from Atocha (appr 400 m). Wifi was working smoothly, we got all the assistance needed (were able to use computer and print out the boarding passes), so I don\u2019t have absolutely nothing negative to say about the hotel.

We stayed here for a week in May and got exactly what we were looking for -- EXCELLENT service and a location that cannot be beat. The hotel is right across the street from the Prado and a straight shot up to Plaza Mayor - so that was perfect. The room was much like many European hotel rooms - a bit smallish but extremely clean. People saying that they had no room to put their bags must have been bringing in several steamer trunks full of clothes because my wife and I always overpack and we had absolutely no problem with room. We both had large suitcases (filled to the brim - 23kg exactly!!) - a backpack each that were jammed with shoes and other clothes - as well as another carry on -- and everything fit in the room without incident. The \"rain\" shower was very nice although for the life of me I will never understand why Europeans do not have doors that go all the way across their showers - the 1/2 door tends to allow the floor to get wet. I have seen several complaints about the internet -- we used it all week long with no problems. I have also seen people having issues on here about the air conditioning - while it was (for me) too hot where they have it set - all you have to do is call down to the desk and they will lower it. It still was a little warm for me and they happily lowered it again. I cannot speak to the breakfast or restaurant because we did not eat there - nor do I know why someone would eat at the hotel when there are so many amazing choices around the city. I also cannot speak to the spa because we never even saw it while we were there. My biggest problem with what I have read on here is people complaining about the service - No one being at the front desk - people being unfriendly - and service taking too long to react. I literally had the complete opposite experience.. There was someone at the front desk when we came down early in the morning for our plane, there was someone there when we came late at night after a tapas crawl - there was someone there every time we walked into the hotel. We had several different people help us with directions, suggestions and were always greeted with a smile and a hello. We had one minor incident where the light in the closet was out - fixed by the time we got back in the room. We asked for ice - 5 minutes and they were at out door. When we left each morning - we asked for our water bottle to be filled with ice - each day the host at the restaurant filled it with a smile on his face. One thing -- people have said that it was hard to find for cabbies - during our trip we had three different cabs take us to the hotel -- one got us to the doorstep and the other two got us \"in the vicinity\" - so there is some truth to it although I do not understand why to be honest.

Then it all became dark and black. I was not sure if the walls were black or if they were mirrors. Most of the foyer was the same. Too dark. I could not find reception at first. Check-in was slow but at the time this was not a problem. We had reserved a business room and were given a room on the second floor with a balcony overlooking a lovely square near the Prado. However, natural light was only provided by the window from the small balcony. It took me ages to find the main light switch for all the lights. The room had a long hall opening to the bed area. There was no place to put suitcases except on the floor in the hallway. The bed seemed to take up the whole room. There were photographic murals on two walls making the room appear even smaller. The bathroom had a large walk in shower with rain shower effect. There was no space for toiletries etc., for two people. I felt there was a lot of wasted space in the bathroom that could have been used to extend the sink unit. There was no place to hang the bath mat once used, so it was left on the floor.

The usual business room desk had been replaced by a round table. The bedside tables were also mix and match round tables with no drawers. There was no place to put clothing for a long stay apart from the wardrobe and a couple of drawers in the cupboard. Good internet. Large flat screen TV provided but there was only BBC World and CNN in English. We found the pillows were too soft. The breakfast room was pleasant though lacking in atmosphere. The breakfast offered was cold and fully self-service. We learned later that a cooked breakfast was available to order. The food and beverages were in another room. It was a bit of a walk. The only real advantage of staying here was the location and proximity to the Prado Museum and the other museums in the area. The Atocha railway station is a 15 minute walk away. There appeared to be good transport links in the area. Lots of tapas bars and caf\u00e9s too. On our return visit we requested a different room but we were given the same room as on our initial stay. Check out on both occasions was a bit slow, but the staff were friendly and sympathetic and I must say thank you to the staff for printing my boarding pass.

This has not been a good experience, at all. Below I summarized the reasons: 1) During check-in we were given a room (Room 414) by the reception. We went to the room. After a few tries to open the door with our key cards, somebody from inside responded and asked what we were trying to do. This person was actually the guest who was staying in that room at that time. We apologized and returned to reception and explained what happened. Following a few sorry sentences we were sent to another room. 2) We were given the Room 114. In the evening we realized that there were insects (ants) in the bathroom. Next day (16th of April) we informed the cleaning lady. She talked to reception and they changed our room, saying that they would \u201ctoxicate\u201d the room to get rid of the ants. So, we moved to Room 408. 3) There were ants in the bathroom of Room 408, as well. But this time we did not change the room because we believed that that would not help. We only informed the reception about the ants. 4) During our stay we could only use the internet for the first day. From the morning of our second day until the time of our check-out, there was no internet service within the hotel. We contacted the reception several times to learn when the service would be back. We were given all sorts of answers and solutions that did not help anything. At the end, we haven\u00b4t had the WiFi service during 4 of our 5 days stay. 5) As a solution to internet problem, reception gave us a card for a so-called \u201cbusiness center\u201d (a small cell with 1 computer and 1 printer; so small that 2 persons at the same time cannot fit.) But, there was no internet connection available at this computer, either. Another person in the reception told that they already knew that there was no internet in this \u201cbusiness center\u201d. So what did they give us that card for?? 6) At some point the reception staff offered us their own computers at the check-in desk, which we rejected immediately. Letting the guests have access to check-in desk computers, which store private information of all the hotel guests, is very dangerous and unacceptable. 7) During check-out they tried to charge us a Perrier from the minibar which we did not drink. We told that we did not drink anything from the minibar. They said that maybe the person before us drank and they charged us by mistake and asked us to sign a document that we acknowledge the hotel wouldn\u00b4t charge for that drink. We haven\u00b4t signed that document. 8) I would also highlight the low quality of the furnitures in the rooms and bad smell in the hallways. 9) We also noticed that the hotel staff is inexperienced and thus incompetent. 10) At the end we paid the whole amount although we haven\u00b4t received the service quality we paid and expected. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.The location is good. So if you go are going to Madrid, please find another hotel in this area.

First, the car service that picked us up significantly overcharged us for the trip to the hotel to the airport. The irony is that I had called the hotel the day before, requesting car service recommendation, and they suggested this service. Yet, when I informed the Radisson's check in staff, they feigned ignorance, noting that this is not the car service that they use. We subsequently asked to speak with the manager and were told that she would be available in 30 minutes. We requested that she visit our room vs. call as our infant son planned to sleep. Naturally, the 'manager' called our room 1 hour later, waking our son up, and she had the gall to suggest that it was our fault for using the wrong car service. And, the hotel would accept no responsibility nor provide recompense. She was completely unapologetic. When pressed, I learned that she was not the actual manager of the hotel, and I was able to speak with the GM of the hotel. He, conversely, was quite helpful, switching us from our business class room to a suite and noting that he and his front staff person, Pablo, would comp the car and provide complementary transportation to MAD for our flight back to the states. Unfortunately, he did not communicate the complementary taxi to his front staff as upon checkout, they noted that we would be paying for the ride. It took another 15 minutes to get the GM on the phone to advise his staff, so we were happy to leave the Radisson at that point.

Our room felt pretty cramped with nowhere to stow our cases but it was clean with a comfortable bed (Hence the 'so-so'). The tea and coffee-making facilities (including the Nespresso machine) being a welcome addition (although as the tea-bags were supplied by an American company - despite being labelled English Breakfast, produced a pretty weak and foul-tasting brew so hint to the Brits, take your own) . Our room had a small balcony which overlooked the aforementioned plaza. (Sorry I can't remember the name of it and can't find it on the online maps.) Given the proximity of the Paseo del Prado (a major road) the soundproofing was excellent. The breakfast was fine and the waitress happily obliged my husband's request for cooked items each morning (bacon, eggs, mushrooms etc). Only one small gripe, they apparently ran out of orange juice on the third morning, which considering we were in the heart of Spain was somewhat strange. (Hence the 'so-so'.) The 'fitness suite' consisted of a recumbent cycle, exercise bike and treadmill. I liked the changing lights and powerful jacuzzi jets in the pool but it's more like a giant hot-tub and not suitable for a swim. The steam room was cold and not steamy but that may have been because no-one seemed to be using it so they don't go to the expense of heating it. (Hence the 'so-so'.)

Directly across the road from the Prado (truly outstanding), and an easy walk to the Thyssen or Reina Sofia, what more could you ask for? Well, you\u2019re in luck, because the hotel is just a stone\u2019s throw from Taberna Maceira, the gutsiest, most energetic tapas bar imaginable. If you stay at Radisson, eating and drinking at Maceira at least once is a must. For those after something less hectic, other solid eating options are available in close proximity, the perfect way to digest the day\u2019s inundation of masterpieces. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, Retiro Park is an enjoyable 10 minute walk in one direction, and the city centre 10 minutes in the other. In between all this, there\u2019s a hotel to consider, and the Radisson exceeded our expectations. Put simply, the service was impeccable, consistently so, and far beyond anything we had experienced elsewhere in Spain. As an example, they not only booked day tours for us, they actually researched them as well! If today\u2019s favours become tomorrow\u2019s expectations, they\u2019re going to be very busy.

The restaurant did a great burger when going to Maceira a third time seemed too indulgent, but I didn\u2019t get a chance to lounge in the Whisky Bar, which was one of the reasons I chose this hotel. My wife grabbed an in-house massage whilst I hit the intriguing Reina Sofia; a classic win/win right there.

I had a standard king room, which was very large for a European hotel. The bed was nice and there were foam pillows in the closet for those with feather allergies like me. The bathroom was smaller than other hotels of similar class, even in Europe, but for a quick trip it's fine, and I liked the rainfall shower. I could not get the theromstat to go below 19C, which is not cold enough for me for sleeping, so I would try to sleep with the windows open, but the hotel plays this weird music in the hallways, which you can hear if the windows are open (if they are closed it's totally soundproof). Turning the music off around midnight would help. Speaking of the windows, they had a film over them, so you could not see out at all. Light still came in, but I would have liked to have seen out, even if it wasn't a great view. The website advertises a pool, but it's really more of a giant hot tub.

The conversion is nicely done and don't be fooled by the old-fashioned exterior, step inside and you are in a truly modern, highly design-conscious environment. The location is good, it's off the main road and in a pretty quiet location. The whole hotel has a very quiet feel to it, maybe due to the materials used - the corridors have all been soundproofed and if you close the window in your room you won't hear a thing from the outside. This hotel is clearly quite small, which has its pros and cons. The pro is that the service is quite personal, and it does not feel crowded. There is normally only one person in reception, and once you stay a few days they do get to know you. The con is that they can't quite deliver the level of service and facilities larger hotels provide. Having said that - I ordered room service two nights in a row and was pleasantly surprised. Instead of having a separate room service menu you simply order dishes from their top-quality restaurant, and the food was the best room service meal I have had in a long time. I am a seasoned business traveller and often order room service (due to time constraints), and the food was full of flavour, exciting and tasted very fresh. So, top marks for providing such good food in such a modestly sized establishment. The rooms are fine, nothing special. Bathroom large, rain shower nice but honestly every hotel has them nowadays. No ironing board in the room, you have to call housekeeping. Furniture not very practical, there is a chair for relaxing but it's very low and they also give you a bean bag which is great if you are 5 years old but not practical otherwise. Small round table OK but would have preferred a proper desk to work on. Also when having a room service meal there is no proper large table to sit down and eat, you have to use the relaxing chair which is awkward. Breakfast left me disappointed. To be fair, this is a small hotel and comparing to the large hotels I normally stay in is perhaps not fair, but then again I have had breakfasts with more choice in smaller hotels than this. Breakfast buffet is all cold dishes, there is a menu from which you can order a few hot dishes. I ordered an omelette and some bacon/sausages, which was OK (nothing more) and the buffet is also nothing more than OK. Also it's quite time-consuming to always have to order your hot dishes, instead of just taking them from a buffet - my time is very limited in the mornings. This is one of the cons of the small size of the hotel - they haven't got scale so can't offer a large breakfast buffet like a much bigger hotel can do. Still, they could do much better with their hot dishes. There are no taxis outside so they will have to call you one, and it takes 5-10 minutes before they arrive so factor this into your trip if you are going for a meeting in the morning.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Miami Beach, Florida", "Title": "\u201cGreat location; contemporary, clean rooms\u201d", "Author": "Sobe21", "ReviewID": "UR120788729", "Content": "Radisson Blu is a very nice contemporary hotel in Madrid.

Room also too warm and couldn't turn down thermostat. Found out front desk electronically controls limits on room thermostat, once they adjusted the room itself was fine. - Late night (11 pm) room service menu quite limited (though similar to many hotels). - Casual chair in room more form over function, not that comfortable to lounge or work in, and bed a bit too soft, but otherwise comfortable.

The hotel was great, modern, and well designed, but it was really the staff that made our stay the best. The hotel itself is locate on a small and quiet street, but literally 2 blocks away from beautiful parks, museums, and small restaurants and bars; the location is pretty perfect. The hotel is pretty small as well, with about 50 rooms. The hotel also has a restaurant inside that has some pretty good food, as well as a very trendy pool and spa (with light up showers and lounge music included). The rooms are also nice, with some interesting design to each one. The standard rooms are a little small, but not any smaller than what is normal for spain. If you are thinking of spending the extra money to get an exterior room, it is VERY worth the money. The rooms are nicer and have a huge window with a balcony facing out to the street, which really makes all the difference. However, as I said, what truly made our stay was the amazing staff. From the moment we walked int hey were extremely friendly, helping us with all we needed. We got in early and our room was ready (we had an interior standard room without a balcony), and we asked them if there was another one available with a window. They told us we would have to wait to check out time to see if someone left, so we strolled for a couple hours and came back to find that two people at the front desk had spent a good amount of time moving things around and figuring out a way for us to get a nicer, bigger, room with a balcony; at no extra charge. We spent 3 days in this room, and then took a trip for a while to then return a week later, during which they were happy to keep our bags and remembered us immediately as we walked back in the room. This time, I had booked a balcony room, and found that they had upgraded us for free to a full suite, without me even asking! Needless to say, the constant helping attitude, friendly faces, and effort to make our stay as enjoyable as possible made the hotel experience one of the best I have ever had. They will truly make your stay all the better.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "gr", "Title": "\u201creally wonderful\u201d", "Author": "mf2006", "ReviewID": "UR117381638", "Content": "Very nice hotel in a very convenient area, close to the major museums and the Retiro Park.

There is a very small gym with a nice pool and sauna as well as the possibility of massages. We really liked the hotel, but had to go up from the standard room to accomadate our teen as the regular room would have been too small to comfortably fit a rollaway (for which about 6o euros is charged). While I loved the business suite which had a comfortable couch made up into a bed (only fits one teen-not a sleeper), I did not like the glass wall in the bathroom which denies privacy. Also, they have a bar on the lobby floor which is so cold looking that it was always empty. They do have another bar, but that was also empty in the evening. The hotel is saving resources (this usually equals cost cutting measures) and so leaves the hallways and maybe the elevators without a/c (maybe heating in the winter) which is a bit uncomfortable in 90 plus degree heat. However, the rooms are very comfortable temperature and otherwise.

We did not exactly brush up our Spanish beforehand but everyone seemed very friendly and keen to recommend different authentic dishes despite the language barrier. It felt very safe to go out even late at night. - Decent room and cool design. Love the huge mirror and over-head shower in the bathroom. - Attentive staff. Cons (rather minor stuff) - I have to agree with previous comments that the water temperature seemed to jump up and down a fair bit. (It was almost like 15-second of decent temperature and 2-second extreme hot.) - Lack of make-up mirror in the bathroom. - Average quality of toiletry: lack of cotton buds and cotton pads.

I've never had such an experience. 2. There was only BBC TV in English - unless you wanted to pay 15EU for more English language TV. 3. The strange bathroom design meant it was really impossible to have a shower without getting the whole room wet (although I note the showers were wheelchair friendly, perhaps these things are related). 4. The shower ran hot and cold meaning you had to keep stepping out of it to avoid being burned. All little things - but it's the little things that make the difference, sometimes.

The positives: 1. The hotel staff was unfailingly pleasant, attentive, helpful, professional, and in command of at least adequate English. 2. The location is perfect for the art-tourist: a short walk from the Prado, the Reina Sofia, the Thyssen, and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. It is also a short walk to the main train station and convenient to a host of restaurants. It is in the middle of everything, yet secluded and quiet. 3. It offers an effectively all-you-can-eat breakfast, a great convenience, and it is substantial: you can select from a better-than-average buffet and/or from the menu. The two in combination offer just about anything you could want. 4. The massage my wife received in the spa was very good. Although the massage therapist did not have much English, we were able to specify areas that needed special attention (feet and back after long hours in museums and sight-seeing) when we booked the appointment. Unfortunately, these were substantially offset by the negatives on my recent visit: 1. The \u201cfree wireless\u201d did not work. (In fairness, we did not follow up with the hotel.) 2. The climate control in the room kept it suffocatingly hot. The thermostat did not respond to our efforts, suggesting it was either preset or broken. We spoke to the front desk and asked the preset thermostat to be lowered to 18 C; this was presumably done, but the room remained hot. We endured our five-day stay by keeping the window open. (In fairness, we only inquired once.) 3. The water temperature always felt as if you were on the verge of running out of hot water. It is perhaps appropriate that the water from the sink should never be scalding, but the shower never felt quite warm enough. 4. The channel selection on the television was the most limited I have yet experienced in a European hotel. The only English-language channels available were the BBC and Al Jazeera. 5. The pillows were remarkably limp and flat. 6. I want to be clear that the hotel staff was excellent, but I believe management has left the staff overworked and stretched thin. There was considerable evidence of short-staffing, and I suspect employees maintained their chipper, upbeat mood only because, with Spain\u2019s unemployment rate around 20%, they are too frightened to do otherwise. This possibility was reinforced by a somewhat sinister customer satisfaction survey I received by email after check-out, asking me to name specific hotel employees for credit or blame. In light of all these experiences, I would not recommend the Radisson Blu, particularly as there are several other hotels in the same price range located close by.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton England", "Title": "\u201cCool hotel in the narrow atmospheric streets of prado\u201d", "Author": "Waldea", "ReviewID": "UR97027635", "Content": "A cool hotel right in prado.

We had originally booked at another hotel, but when they replied dismissively to an email I sent requesting information, I viewed that as a red flag. Fortunately, I had just read the New York Times review of the Radisson Blu, so I rebooked there and was not disappointed. The location is incredibly convenient, just ~100\u2019 or so off the Paseo del Prado, placing it immediately across from the Prado Museum, yet located just behind another building so that traffic noise was limited. The hotel is on the corner of a small side street and a little square that houses a pleasant caf\u00e9/bar, with tables and plenty of seating. The reception staff at the Radisson Blu was a group of young, attractive women and men who were always welcoming, cheerful, and readily helpful. They greeted us pleasantly each time we passed through the lobby. Our room (212) was very comfortable and spotlessly clean. It overlooked a side street, so while we didn\u2019t have a glamorous or expansive view, we could open the window to see the little square in front, yet we still enjoyed perfect quiet for sleeping. In fact, the hotel seemed to be exceptionally well sound-proofed, and that\u2019s saying something, because I am a light sleeper. (Rooms on the front facing the square might not be as quiet.) The bed was firm but comfortable and offered a variety of pillow types, both light feather and firmer polyfill. The room offered plenty of lighting options: you could turn the lights up to very bright to see into a loaded black suitcase and yet also dim the bounce lights to more subdued lighting. The bedside reading lamps operated individually so that I could read the guidebook before sleep without keeping my husband up. Our bathroom didn\u2019t have a tub, just a shower, but the rain shower had a handset with enough pressure to massage my feet. The hairdryer was so peppy that I used it instead of my own. The closet was roomy enough for us to hang clothes for 2 and offered a reasonable count of wooden hangers, including enough skirt hangers. A Nespresso machine was tucked in near the minibar and safe, and the coffee was free. The wireless worked flawlessly. There were some minor glitches. There is no standard lobby with seating where you can wait to meet someone. Instead, just inside the entry is a high concept and glassy-surfaced whiskey bar called \u201cThe Cask\u201d which we never saw anyone occupy. The regular bar/restaurant has seating, but it is out of sight of the lobby. There are benches in the long doorway. The small \u201cspa\u201d in the basement was a little odd. I think there were 3 pieces of aerobic equipment and 1 TV, private rooms for massage, and a small dip pool that I had assumed was a hot tub but was instead a small plunge pool. Still, the environment was serene, and when my husband needed a nap I retreated to the spa, stretched out on one of the chaises and checked email and read while being soothed by the spa music. Also, the TV options were rather limited, i.e., no international CNN, just CNBC (I think.). Most channels were Spanish only, but \u2013 hey -- we weren\u2019t there to watch TV. These issues were very minor. Overall, I really liked the hotel and I wish more offered these features for the price.

They also video record a every transaction at the front desk, which could be useful because of the many pickpockets in the tourist section.", "Date": "June 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Silkeborg, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cThe place to stay if you go to Madrid\u201d", "Author": "RasmusMunch", "ReviewID": "UR63877338", "Content": "The perfect hotel in Madrid must be Radisson blu, Madrid Prado. From the second we arrived we felt welcome. The staff told us about the facilities and made themselves available should we need any help. Rooms were not big but adequate for this type of stay. Cleaning was perfect. Small but nice and relaxing spa-area. Staff friendliness and service was high. The service in the hotel restaurant, The Cask, was impeccable and Rodrigo made our dining experience excellent. The hotel is very nice located 50 meters from a main street, and it was quite calm and tranquille even though it was near many cozy bars and restaurants, 10 minutes from downtown Plaza del Sol, just a few minutes from the train and metro and 50 meters from the bus and taxis. We would recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to go to Madrid. Excellent price/value.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cStylish boutique hotel - great location\u201d", "Author": "chris2401", "ReviewID": "UR57305212", "Content": "My partner booked this hotel as a birthday present and we really enjoyed our stay! The room was ready for ckeck-in when we arrived, which was before the normal check-in time. The staff was very friendly and helpful making restaurant reservations as well as giving us tips on what to do. The room we had was on the smaller side, but has everything you need. The bathrooms were very cool. Breakfast was nice but too expensive compared to hotels in London. We also loved the spa area, the jacuzzi was fun too.
