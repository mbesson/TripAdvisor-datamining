I had a Room in the second floor which face the Grossowstrasse. It was really quiet, and i was able to sleep very well without ear plugs. the bed and pillow were really comfortable. there is a manual safe deposit and you can lock it with the set of keys you receive when you check in. The room and bathroom were super clean! I paid 33 euros for each night including the breakfast. Nollendorfplatz station its very close, bars/clubs/restaurants in the area but hte grossowstrasse its very quiet/residential. The wifi worked without problems. the room and bed can feel a bit packed, but you have everything you need. My friends (a couple) stayed in another room in the first (reception) floor.

Hotel Ambiente is close to the Sch\u00f6neberg gay scene without being an intentional part of that scene. There are lots of nice restaurants, pubs and caf\u00e9s nearby, especially in Winterfeldtstr., Eisenacherstr., Motzstr. and Maa\u00dfenstr. The staff was friendly and helpful. Upon arrival I was given a good map of the area. The receptionist accommodated my luggage when I arrived early and for a few hours after I checked out. I spoke only German with the staff, so I cannot comment on their English language proficiency. The room was not large (about 15 x 13 ft., excluding the bath), but space is organized very efficiently, and it was clean and well appointed, including a small refrigerator. As an example of space efficiency, the single chair in the room can be placed at the mini-fridge, so that its wooden top becomes a table or desk. The small television is mounted 7 feet high in a corner, and if you wish to watch TV, there is an additional deposit required for the remote control. (I didn\u2019t bother.) A large window provides plenty of natural light. I was not bothered by noise from outside or inside the hotel, except of course for the unavoidable Sunday morning Glockenspiel emanating from the city\u2019s church spires. I\u2019ve had more comfortable beds, but it\u2019s typical in Germany not to have a double mattress or box springs, and the mattress was plush enough to give me a good recovery from jet lag. There are two very convenient wall sconce reading lamps above the double bed, each with its own control. The bath was a decent size with clean modern fixtures, including a shower cabinet (no tub). Hot water was prompt and plentiful, and the towels are of good quality, though I wish they were a bit larger. I also appreciated that the reception desk is not directly located on the stair landing or in direct view of the hotel entrance, rather separated from the stairway by a door at the landing one floor up from street level. While a receptionist was available 24 hours a day, it is also nice not to be constantly observed when coming or going. A computer with internet connection is available to guests free of charge in the lobby area. The breakfast buffet is optional for an extra charge, and I appreciated having that price flexibility. The breakfast is quite good, including hot and cold items as well as fresh fruit and is provided in a large sunny room with white table cloths. I found it worth the additional 6.50 euros per day that I was charged; however, if you wish to save on food expenses, there are less expensive breakfast options at nearby stand-up caf\u00e9s and bakeries, e.g. in the Winterfeldtstr. At other times you might wish to purchase a few items from the Penny Markt grocery next door to the hotel. Penny Markt sells fresh produce, some packaged deli items, wine and beer. The Bad: Not a lot is really bad about this hotel. One minor objection I had about the bathroom is that there is no convenient surface onto which one can place personal travel items, such as a shaving kit. The small glass shelf under the mirror is inadequate for that. Alternatives include bringing the chair into the bathroom or placing the shaving gear on the floor. As with any European lodging, if you like to bathe with a wash cloth, bring your own from home. If you come from a country outside the euro zone, you have the option of paying the bill in your home currency by credit card through a service called Elavon. I researched this and do not recommend it. The exchange rate is unfavorable, and Elavon has a 3.5% additional markup. For me it was less expensive to just pay my card provider's currency conversion fee, or of course to pay in cash. For me the positives far outweigh any negatives about Hotel Ambiente. It was a good value for the price, and I would definitely consider another stay there.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Santa Barbara, California", "Title": "\u201cQuiet and Charming\u201d", "Author": "NomadYuma", "ReviewID": "UR114068104", "Content": "We stayed 2 nights at the hotel in May 2011.

However I want to share my unfortunate experience with you. On the first day of my visit ,my money was stolen from my room. When I came to my room , I saw that my money had gone. My credit cards, GPS and mobile phone was not stolen. I am %100 sure that I did not lose or droped it, because my local banknots had gone as well. I was lucky that only my money was stolen.When I went to reception to tell this robbery, they just protected their staff. They just said they were SORRY!!!. In the morning the reception called me to visit them. I suppose that they were afraid that I would run away, and they asked my to pay for the room. Ofcourse they were worried of being not paid but they should consider the rights and safety of their guests as well. I did not report to the police , because I was visiting Berlin for 3 days, and I did not want to ruin my remaining holiday.

There is a lift, though one has to climb 4 steep steps to reach the lift (which the hotel was careful to inform me of before taking my booking). The location is safe and residential with lots of restaurants about 1 minute walk away and also very close to Ku'damm (not walking distance). The hotel is at the end of a small street which tends to be deserted at night, but that is only because there are no commercial properties on the street.

Reception staff were friendly and there is free internet access from a terminal in the hall. Breakfast was served in a large airy breakfast room and featured the usual orange juice, rolls, bread, cereals, cold cuts and cheeses, boiled eggs, plus very good coffee that was always hot and fresh and a samovar of boiling water with a selection of teas.
