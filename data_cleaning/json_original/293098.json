The staff at the restaurant, the bar and the reservation department were quite friendly and service minded though. This is what happened: When returning to our hotel room we discovered a heavy smell of tobacco smoke in our non-smoking room. Due to the fact that we both have asthma I immediately went downstairs to the reception to ask if we could change room? I came across a quite corpulent man among the reception staff. I explained the situation and the reply that I was given was: \"Is it REEEEEALLY that bad??\". I did not believe my ears! When I insisted that we were given another room the quite corpulent man gave me a heavy sigh and then handed over a new room key and just looked at me, as if I were a total idiot. The man did not even ask if we needed any assistance when changing room. We have never ever been so unkindly treated at any hotel before!

The room was quite small and utilitarian with two single beds and very little storage. There is a sliding door that covers either an area with a tiny shower and toilet or an oddly configured sink in the middle of the room. I felt as if I were staying in a college dormitory room that was furnished from IKEA. The bed was hard and uncomfortable and was covered only with a top sheet that had a duvet folded up at the bottom. I felt that the bed was never properly made, since I had to spread out the comforter every night. Everyday, when the room was made up, the duvet was refolded and placed at the bottom of the bed. Amenities are few and far between, and the design of the room is modular. With a only a small floating shelf to use as a desk, it was uncomfortable when using the work area for any length of time. In addition, I find the rate of 15 Euros per day to be an excessive amount for Internet service. Now to the positive side. After a couple of days at the Golden Tulip, I realized that the staff were friendly and helpful, and it eased the burden of the sparse accommodations. Their attentiveness and courtesy began to win me over and I concentrated less on what was wrong with the hotel. The breakfast buffet, although not included in the room rate, was reasonably priced and pretty good overall. I had dinner at the same restaurant on two occasions, and it provided better than many hotel dinners I have had in the past. The hotel is relatively new and always appeared clean and fresh. The Golden Tulip Berlin would not be my first choice on my next trip to the city, but during a busy convention week, it proved to be adequate.

He was was very helpful and welcoming to our family and made our stay extra special :o) The Hotel is well located on a quiet street in the centre of the city close to shops, restaurants, public transport & attractions. There is a gym next door which residents can use. The hotel was very well presented and all areas had a relaxed high quality feel to the decor and layout. The Hotel breakfast was impressive with plenty of choice and daily variations of hot and cold foods. It was easy to find a healthy option if we wanted. There were also a substantial range of teas and juices to choose from. The purpose of our trip was my sister in-law's birthday. I e-mailed ahead to let the hotel know. On arrival Sebastian wished her a happy birthday and informed her that her room had been up-graded. My husband and I were also given a slight upgrade. Now that's what I call great customer service! Rooms were beautiful, modern and kept spotlessly clean. Hotel staff were helpful, approachable, friendly and polite. Even when I flooded the bathroom! This hotel was chosen as an upgrade when our travel agent made a mistake with our original booking, so we did not pay full price. However I think it is well worth the list price.

The bathroom seemed quite nice at first with its' quite modern sink, but once we got the hang of things, it was horrible. The hairdryer doesn't work at all, the bottom opening thing of the sink doesn't move up or down despite trying to push/pull/move its' tap thing. In other words you can't close or open the water drain, so the water would stay in the sink. You have to pull the part out of the drain and unscrew the little bolt at the end to make it stand higher in order to let the water out of the sink, or screw it closer to make it hang in the drain keeping the water in the sink. So it didn't work. The shower has no curtain, only a window sort of thing about a meter long with a hinge, which is supposed to stay closed by it's rubber bottom not letting the water leak to the other side of the window on to the floor. Well once it got wet, it didn't stay closed and the water flooded on the floor. We wanted and booked a room with air conditioning, but suprise suprise, it didn't work. No matter how you move the two switches, it doesn't work. We noticed the front desk about it, they were shocked and luckily went to fix it in the room. The room got \"cleaned\" every morning if you wanted, but the sheets were not changed every second day, as told in the room's brochure.

The breakfast is not suited not even for a 3 star hotel. It had only the essentials and when something was finished, they didn't replace it, although I asked them several times. For example one day they didn't have white bread and omelette and although there was still remaining an hour till the end of breakfast nothing was refilled. Supposedly the hotel offers a common laptop in the lobby, but it was always occupied and when I asked it one day for an emergency from another guest, the receptionist came and told me in an ugly way to leave it. She spoke to me to German, although I told her that I knew only a little. Of course the real reason was that the other customer was German and I a foreigner. So she thought that I could accept this inappropriate behavior. I asked several times for the manager but she wouldn't call him and I don't even know if there was one at the hotel at that time. I've stayed in many 4-star hotels in the past and this could hardly be a 3-star hotel. The only good thing is its location, but there are plenty of other hotels nearby, like the Holiday Inn.

We were happy with the situation of the hotel but on the other hand we discovered that the more interesting part of Berlin is in the former East-Berlin, the Mitte district (Unter der Linden boulevard, Brandenburger Tor, Reichstag, Spree river etc), which means that a possible next time we will choose a hotel more close to this much nicer part of the city, where history is more present. About the hotel itself: we already were warned in other comments that the standard rooms are quite small and indeed, they truly are! In our opinion this is not what a 4-star hotel should offer to it's guests. The bathroom, too, is small. Every comfort is present, but there definitely should have been more space and a nice chair to sit and relax. A bit budget-class. The breakfast was O.K. but I suppose not better or worse than in other similar hotels in this category. For dinner we would give the advice to look elsewhere. The taste of the food was below expectation and the service was in line with that. The Italian restaurant on the other side of the street offered a very nice meal, but if you like Italian food you definitely should try the Bocca di Bacco restaurant in the Friedrichstrasse 167, opposite the Galeries Lafayette departmentstore in the Mitte district.

We experienced three different room types. Standard rooms on the lower floors are nicely appointed with modern decor but very cramped in our opinion. Beware that there is not enough room for a normal suitcase at the bottom of the bed. The wardrobe is also a small half size open plan type. As we felt we'd feel claustrophobic after more than one night we upgraded to a comfort room, which are at the end of the corridors and was slightly larger but still small. On the second night we upgraded to a suite on the eighth floor. The room was larger and a similar size to what is usually found at 4* hotels. However these rooms are pre-refurbishment and was darkly decorated with a tiny very old nokia TV, old beds, and lacking safe. Nice views however. There were minor faults in all rooms, eg broken shower enclosures, loose toilet seats etc. We realised the suite window was faulty as there was a small gap in the frame which meant a lot of noise from the street came in. This was put right the next day. There were cigarrete smoke smells in some rooms and along corridors despite them being non-smoking rooms. There is a single pc with free internet access in the business closet next to reception. Breakfast is quite expensive and not great, consequently there were never more than one or two people there each day. There is a mini supermarket right next door and cafes where a decent breakfast costs under 7 euros nearby. The hotel is more like a 20 min fast walk to Wittenberg Platz U bahn, and 25-30 min fast walk to Zoologischer Garten U/S bahn station. To get the famous no. 100 bus to the centre, turn left at the hotel entance , walk to the end of the road and cross the dual carriageway to the other side. The hotel itself is a 1970's style concrete block with modern cladding and small old lifts, and similar style 3 star hotels in the vicinity. It is in a quiet residential area, and nothing of much interest in the evenings in the immediate vicinity, but the KuDamm is 30 mins brisk walk away. We felt fairly safe in this part of West Berlin. Hotel staff were not friendly, or welcoming but efficient. We had to request tea/coffee making facilities which comes with powdered milk and decaff coffee only. This was only ever replenished when requested at reception and not when we asked the room cleaners. Check-out is also 11am and not 2pm as stated in certain booking websites. We would stay here again if we had to but next time we will either pay more and stay in the lively Potzdamer Platz, or City centre part of the Mitte district, or pay less staying in one of the 3* hotels near the Hotel Hamburg (which had larger rooms).", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ireland", "Title": "\u201cgreat location\u201d", "Author": "pamIreland", "ReviewID": "UR11229173", "Content": "stayed at the above hotel for 3 nights,staff at reception very friendly and helpful on arrival,rooms spotless,great location,staff very helpful with booking sight seeing trips for us,lovely breakfast,overall very pleased with hotel", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Aller\u00f8d", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel with excellent service\u201d", "Author": "MCAller\u00f8d", "ReviewID": "UR10090362", "Content": "We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed it very much.

Its location isn\u2019t bad, off a main road and therefore quiet and only about 10\u2019 walk from the KDW, the best (and most expensive) department store in Berlin. The area around the hotel is OK; though there are a couple of \u2018adult\u2019 shops which you will see on the way to the main shopping precinct (I say this in case you are offended by these establishments). Your experience as a guest, as ever, starts at reception. I was greeted in a very efficient and mildly patronising way while I was handed over the key, when very strict instructions on where and when breakfast was served were literally shouted at me. I know that with tens of thousand of air miles behind me and being in my mid forties my hearing isn\u2019t what it used to be, but this was the first time ever that I was loudly \u2018instructed\u2019 about breakfast, rather than simply told. After this teenager finished shouting his orders, he asked in the same tone of voice whether I had further questions, so, rather than risking it, I decided instead to meekly take leave of reception, quickly sneaking into the lift. I was told I had been allocated a newly refurbished room, which at first sight looked great; soft colours greeted you and invited you in, so I did, and here is when problems started. I wanted somewhere to drop my case; but the designers had obviously not foreseen the possibility that people staying in a hotel could carry a case, so there was either the small armchair, or the floor. I opened the (tiny) wardrobe, found the safe, tried re-setting it and got an error message; reported it to reception later (by then staffed by an equally unhelpful person), and was thanked for reporting it. Pardon me, what are you going to do about it? Sorry, no one around to fix it, maybe tomorrow\u2026 well, no use to me, as I was only staying one night. It was unusually warm in Berlin and I had a busy day, I was hot and bothered and wanted, literally, to chill out while catching up with some work. I switched the air con controls, put it on full blast and the unit started blowing air, and that was that. I mean \u2018air\u2019, but nothing of the \u2018conditioning\u2019 element. A further call to reception enlightened me on the fact that air-con could only be switched on during \u2018certain months of the year\u2019 (January and February maybe), scolding me a bit for having dared asking such a silly question. By then, resigned on my fate, I took my laptop out of its case and looked for some work space. The small desk (you may have gathered by now that everything in the room was doll-size and note I am only 5\u20196\u201d!) was covered in clutter, a basket with a delicious sample of crisps (off the minibar), a tray with additional minibar samples, a large display with hotel brochures \u2013 all staff that ended up on the floor as there was no other desk space available and even what this clutter was taken away there was then only space for a small book next to my laptop. Anyway, I could enlighten you about other aspects of my stay, telling you about the bathroom, the bed side lights that when switched on in the middle of the night daze you like car lights or cauterize your fingers when you try to switch them off and so on, why bother? If I were you, unless you suffered from an unhealthy guilt complex and felt like punishing yourself (bosses don\u2019t read this!) I wouldn\u2019t bother with this place, staying instead somewhere where you\u2019d be made feel welcome and where rooms were designed with the most basic travellers\u2019 needs in mind.", "Date": "April 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Philadelphia, PA", "Title": "\u201cGood Hotel, Poor Location for Tourists\u201d", "Author": "von_levi", "ReviewID": "UR5006751", "Content": "The only problem with the hotel is the location. As a healthy 20-something, it took me 30 minutes to walk to the Brandenburg Gate; Museum Island is about 20 minutes further. So plan on taking public transportation or taxis to get too and from the hotel. At night the area is low lit and a bit shady (I decided to walk back after a concert at the Philharmonie). I got the impression that most of the people staying at hotel were businessmen who would have their taxi rides comped and tour groups who had their own buses. The hotel itself is fairly modern. My single room was a good size. The breakfast was quite good. The hotel restaurant was fair at best, though, I appreciated the convenience of having a restaurant on site. The staff was terrific.
