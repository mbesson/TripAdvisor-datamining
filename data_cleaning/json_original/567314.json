We stayed in a Studio Suite. Reception was not always manned so don't count on having tourist info or help at hand. Bathroom is TINY and old but very clean. If paying up to 60E for studio suite it is good value anything more than that, don't bother. The suites are advertised as self catering which just meant 2 tiny electric hotplates. But, the pans provided were sooooo old and in such bad condition that cooking anything other than a boiled egg was impossible. Locations is ok, 10 min walk to the Vatican entrance but only about 5 mins to a large number of buses that wil take you to Termini train station, centre of Rome, Colosseum etc. It was a long walk up very steep stairs to get from the nearest Metro station. If staying here, get around by bus not metro.", "Date": "February 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Scotland", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Accommodation\u201d", "Author": "NosillaScotland", "ReviewID": "UR21503287", "Content": "Fantastic Apartment, Clean & Fresh, very private,Great Location, easy to find, Within walking distance of good restaurants & shops, vatican, and Tube station at Ottaviano literally just round corner for easy access to all other areas of Rome.

Family of 4. We had a single room. 1 double and 2 single beds, 1 wardrobe and a broken set of chest of draws. No TV although there was tea/coffee facilities. The room was clean enough although beware of some sites selling rooms here as they say that payment is only required when you leave. In fact the owners took 25% up front on credit card and then we had to pay full in cash on arrival. For one room with little facilities I thought this was expensive. We were charged 750 euros. We were met by the owners on arrival for payment but then we never saw them again. We are pretty good independent travellers so that was not a problem but if you need help then this is not the place for you. Location was great for the vatican, 5 mins walking. Got to say guys I think for the price we paid and the facilities I think you can do better if you look around and book early enough.", "Date": "November 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cold Lake, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cWish we'd stayed elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "burry", "ReviewID": "UR7757381", "Content": "I had to leave writing this review for a few days so my simmering temper could neutralise! Basically, I don't have many nice things to say about \"Vatican Suites\". It seems that there are three rooms there and I saw two of them. One was a small, double room with no 'suite' to speak of. My husband and I stayed in a large double room which also had two single beds. Again, it was not a 'suite'. I can only assume the third room was the two bedroom apartment that various other people have reviewed. I found our double room through venere.com and we paid 105 euros per night for a 4 night stay. We'd arranged in advance with David to arrive at 5pm, however, we turned up at 3.30pm and it took about forty minutes to organise earlier access to our room. There is no reception so David meets you there to let you in. The buzzer for the apartment didn't work so we had to try and call him. The closest pay phone didn't accept coins or our credit card so it turned into a bit of drama. Anyway, this wasn't really David's fault so I'll move on. Our first impression of the room was great. It is extremely close to the Vatican, restaurants and the Metro. After nearly a month travelling around Italy, we were pleasantly surprised at the large size of our room. It had a small fridge, a new bathroom and a double bed - not two singles pushed together! We happily paid David cash (except a 25% deposit which we'd previously paid on credit card) and he gave an excellent map and some suggestions for things to do in Rome. Unfortunately, that was where our good impression of the room and of David finished...Our room was on the street and we were kept awake all night with street noise. The windows and shutters were so old that they didn't close properly. Although we were on the 2nd floor, we could hear everything from car alarms two blocks away to the details of conversations as people strolled past the building. My husband is a very heavy sleeper and even he was woken up constantly. The shutters were permanently fixed in an open position (no moveable horizontal slats) so they didn't cut much light out. Unfortunately, the curtains were shear so did nothing to darken the room. After finally getting sleep in the wee hours, we were woken before 6am when the sun rose! For the following three nights, we learnt how to stuff the lourve slats with our own clothes and a blanket to cut out the light (it didn't help the noise though). Although the windows were our biggest problem with the room, there were other issues that would prevent us from staying there again: - The hot water system was terrible! Whenever we wanted to take a shower, we'd have to start running the water at least 5-10 minutes earlier. Also, whenever water was running (i.e. whenever flushed the toilet, whenever we washed our hands), the water system behind the toilet would continually kick in and was very noisy. We couldn't flush the toilet at night because of this, nor use any of the taps. - It had the smallest shower in the world. Basically, if you dropped the soap, you'd have to get out of the shower to pick it up. Don't even think about shaving your legs... - There were no reading lamps, only one pillow each, no mirrors except one over the basin in the bathroom and no internet. The cleaner came once but didn't restock our toilet paper. There were no toiletries (inc. soap) provided. We emailed David in the morning after our first night with all of these issues. Late that night we got an 'out of office' reply that perhaps wasn't so automated (can yahoo even let you do out of office messages?!?). Anyway, it said that David was conveniently out of the office until our last day. Hmm, he didn't tell us that when we checked in! We didn't want to call again because he only had a mobile number and we didn't think we should have to pay just to get feedback/help from the proprietor! Well, the final day came and went and still no word from David. We checked out and eventually emailed David from the airport and told him what we thought. He basically told us he wasn't interested in our complaints; wasn't interested in fixing anything; and that we should have rung him rather than email. We replied but have since not heard anything else. So, would I recommend my friends or even enemies to stay here...? The answer is NO. Next time, I would pay 10 euros more and stay in a proper hotel or B&B where you can actually get some sleep and some service from the proprietor.", "Date": "June 4, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Yorkshire, England", "Title": "\u201cAverage\u201d", "Author": "ian.spence1", "ReviewID": "UR7188791", "Content": "clean and well positioned for The Vatican, however very basic in that little storage space to store clothes other than a wardrobe, IE no chest of drawers, small bathroom and the shower rail was broken meaning had to shower holding nozzle, room was not made up on second day, and on last day owner had organised a taxi back to airport for us, after waiting 10 minutes for it to arrive decided to leave and get our own which was actually 20 Euros cheaper.
