Before booking and trying to decide where to stay, we could not believe all the positive reviews this resort had to offer....and as someone else mentioned in their review, totally true!!! From the spectacular views (sunrise a must see!!), to the chic and spacious rooms, to the impeccable grounds, to the genuinely friendliest and honest staff on earth, we were overjoyed with our choice. Everything was so clean (which is a biggie for us). It felt luxurious but warm and welcoming. We enjoyed our tranquil days here and if we wanted the craziness KW has to offer, we were a short walk away from Duval St. We rented bikes from the concierge and really enjoyed exploring KW. This is a must do when in KW. Make sure you go down the side streets and look at all the historical, funky, luxurious homes. The SM Beach Cafe was delicious and well priced. The service was fast and courteous. We enjoyed all our breakfasts here overlooking the beach. We really found paradise here and we are already counting our days until we return. Look no where else when visiting KW....this is the place where you want to stay!!! TO THE MANAGEMENT OF SMOB: We would like to compliment your wonderful property and commend all the fantastic people that work here. We had sadly left our stay and were half way up the keys when we realized that my husband had left his brand new business cell phone in our room. Fearing the worst, he called the front desk for any help that he could get. He spoke with Diana Dorsdy and she could not have been more compassionate and helpful. She immediately put him in contact with Jeanette in housekeeping who found his phone. She promptly shipped it to our next destination. She even called us back with the tracking number. Courtesy and service at this level are seldom seen these days and it gave us pleasure to know that it still exists at your property. This is one of the many reasons why we are returning to your property next February.

We spent more time at Ft Zachary Taylor beach which was prettier and less crowded, albeit a rocky shore. Parking could be a challenge at the resort at night but we eventually always found a spot, even if it was a distance from our building.

Highly Recommend it!\u201d", "Author": "estrnmountain", "ReviewID": "UR126061339", "Content": "My wife and I recently stayed at Southern Most on the Beach and we had a wonderful stay! Let me start with the hotel grounds. They are beautiful! the courtyards between the buildings are all very well manicured and maintained, as well as the lawns surrounding the buildings. The fact that the hotel has it's own private beach, and it right next to a small public beach make it a great place to be if you are looking for beach time. If you are a pool person, there are definitely enough pools on the grounds to choose from. If you want a fun lively pool with a pool bar, they have it. If you want a more quiet pool for adults only, they have it, and all are extremely clean and well maintained. Although we spent our entire days out and about on the island, we did take advantage of the hammocks right by the beach at night when we got back to the hotel and really had a relaxing time by the beach with the great breezes. The hotel is in a great location. It is a convenient walk to the Hemingway House and to a number of restaurants. It is at the opposite end of Duval Street, away from the majority of the bars, so it is in a very quiet part of the island. Granted, it is a bit of a walk to get to Mallory Square or to the pier, but it's not a bad walk at all, and walking Duval Street is a very fun experience, in fact walking all over the island is a great experience. We had thought about renting an electric car or a scooter, but we never did and both of us were glad we didn't because walking the island really gives you a great flavor and adds to the experience of Key West. If you are not into walking, don't worry because therer are plenty of places to rent bikes, carts, scooters, etc, all in very close proximity to the hotel. The staff at the hotel was superb! They were all very nice and helpful, and all very genuine. We never once felt like they were forced to be nice because of tourism. The folks that work there really do seem to enjoy working there, and it shows in all they do. We were always greeted with a hello, good morning, good afternoon, etc, by every one we came in contact with. I would like to call special attention to the concierge staff, especially Bernice. She was so nice and so helpful in giving us ideas, answering questions and making dinner reservations for us. Definitely check out Hot Tin Roof and Cafe Sole. Both were excellent for dinner, and recommendations from Bernice. Our room was very spacious and beautiful. We had a partial ocean view, with a great balcony. The room was very clean and the bed was so very comfortable. After spending a full day out and about, it was so nice to come back to the room for a great night sleep. One of the days we were there, we decided to go to the Southernmost Cafe for Happy Hour. It's right on the beach and it's a great tiki type bar. The happy hour is really good for drinks, although the appetizers on the happy hour menu were just ok. The next time we are there, I would just opt for drinks during happy hour and not get any food. I would definitely recommend it for a fun place to have some drinks and people watch. You will see a lot of different people there and it makes it a fun place to hang out. I can't comment on the food at the restaurants, other than just the appetizers at happy hour, which I mentioned above. We were up early and went out for breakfast (check out Pepe's, across from A&B Marina. Don't let the looks fool you. The food is great!) and we spent most of the days out around the island, so we didn't partake of any food at Southernmost. In closing, I would highly recommend Southernmost on the Beach. It's not cheap, but then again the majority of the lodging options in Key West are not cheap, but Southernmost is definitely worth the price! It's a piece of paradise and you will enjoy it very much! To all the staff at Southernmost on the Beach, we thank you for a wonderful stay!

We splurged on an oceanfront room and it was well worth it. Beautiful view from our bed through windows and french doors on two sides of the room and a large balcony that wrapped around. At this time of year, we could enjoy the sunrise and the sunset from our balcony - which we did daily! The room was well-appointed and the staff surprised us with a bottle of champagne for our celebration. We made use of the small refrigerator with beverages and leftover foods and were pleasantly surprised by bottled water supplied by the hotel at no charge. This hotel is at the quiet end of Duvall - just what we wanted. We rented scooters for our stay and that allowed us to explore and get to the noisy areas when we wanted that! Duvall is only 1 mile long and we enjoyed that walk many times at all hours of the day. We enjoyed the on-property restaurant, Southernmost Beach Cafe, and ate there daily. The blackened shrimp wrap was excellent and the risotto special on the dinner menu (shrimp and mushroom) was a favorite. We also enjoyed the lobster cakes on the dinner menu - those leftovers were terrific cold the next day at lunch! The drinks were nothing special and one order of conch fritters were uncooked and mushy on the inside, but the food was well worth the price. And the view while dining can't be beat! The beach is tiny and the pools are as well. However, there didn't seem to be an issue finding a chair or hammock during this sold-out weekend.

We choose SMOTB mostly due to the comments on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. Before we left we set up deep sea fishing with the hotel and they were pleasant and very helpful. Our stay was great. The hotel is clean and modern. Our room was a partial view, however the view was enough for us to relax on the balcony and enjoy the ocean scene. The rooms are pretty accurate compared to the pictures on the website. The maids were excellent in cleaning as we are very messy (we tipped everyone and then forgot to tip the maids when we left) and they deserved it and I felt bad about that. The pier was great to watch the sunset and it was not a disappointment. We swam in the pool one night and although not huge was adequate and quiet, which we appreciated. All the rooms and balconies are non-smoking which is great, but there are smoker stations for those of us who may want to smoke which was appreciated. SMOTB is on the quiet end of Duvall, which we wanted, yet it is right there to enjoy. We walked from the hotel to the other end and it doesn't take long at all. Our last day we rented bikes from the hotel (you really don't need a rental unless you are venturing farther away) and rode them to the state park on the advice of the concierge. The wind was strong so the ocean was wavy, but the kids had a great time in the water. I would suggest water shoes though. The concierge was great in any questions you had, from where to eat to things to do and both the gals we worked with were friendly and helpful. The front desk was also friendly and polite and available when my sister couldn't get there until after midnight. Then when her door was sticking, someone came immediately to get it open even at that time of night. You can tell the hotel takes pride in their faciliites and cares about getting repeat guests.. Also the beach cafe was great and the hostess remembered us from two days prior and greeted us, which was nice. We did not do any of the activies the hotel plans, however it seemed like those that did were having a great time. Our only thing was there wasn't a microwave in the rooms so we could heat leftovers if we wanted them, but I found out that we could have asked and they would have tried to find one for us.

We chose Southernmost on the Beach primarily for its location - a short walk to everything and right on the ocean. We had a fantastic 3 days and would certainly recommend this hotel to friends, with one caveat: splurge for an oceanfront balcony room - you get what you pay for. Like most waterfront hotels, the Southernmost tries to work the words \"water-view\" into every room type. We found that the website was not entirely clear on what the view from each room type would be, so we booked over the phone after a long, detailed discussion with two members of the reservation staff. We wanted to be absolutely sure that we got the room we wanted and didn't want to have to stand on the corner of the nightstand and lean out of a window to see the ocean. In general, we are very budget minded when choosing a place to stay in the Caribbean (which we visit frequently). We tend to avoid peak season, rent houses rather than stay in hotels, and generally try to stay away from the most developed parts of the islands we visit. In this case we splurged and it was absolutely the right decision. For a few hundred dollars more we had a view of the ocean from anywhere in the room and french doors to a large balcony only a few feet from the water. We could fall asleep to the sound of the ocean and wake up to a spectacular sunrise - in full view while laying in bed! The rest of the hotel was nice. The pool and pool bar were nice, there were plenty of lounge chairs and hammocks to use. The staff was friendly and unobtrusive. But really, for us, the room was the star.

Southernmost On The Beach is where you want to stay not only in Key West, but also in all of the Florida Keys.

My guess is that even the pier has sunset on the water views in the summer. It is perfect. The pool is sizable, modern, and the perfect amount of warm, not too much, but enough to take an evening or brisk sunless day dip.

But when you couple it with the perfect place to stay, you could swear you're in heaven. I know I may seem dramatic, and believe me, I am in no way an experienced world-traveler hotel snob.... but SMOTB far exceeded my expectations, and they will exceed yours too. 1) Warm and hospitable staff -Dexter at the front desk and Boomer the Activities Director are the only names I remember, but I had to give them props! 2)Great food- try the Tropical Chicken Sandwich and a drink called \"The Horny Parrot\" 3)Comfortable beds, clean room, great hair/body products, housecoats and flat screen HD TV 4)Beautiful location and far enough away from crazy Duval street (but close enough that you won't drop dead from walking there) 5)Some things to do right on the resort (all free): Snorkeling, wine tastings, live music every night, hula-hoop contests, etc... 6) Parking is FREE... usually that isn't a big deal, but you will learn that this is a luxury in Key West! 7) Don't cheap out - stay in one of the West Lawn Ocean Front King rooms. You will not regret it. You cannot go wrong here, folks. SMOTB is a well-oiled machine and will make your trip that much better. Trip tip - Rent a bike. Its about $10/day. Cheapest and easiest way to get around. You can rent them right from SMOTB, or across the street. There is also a fantastic breakfast place called The Cuban and The Conch that serves the best cuban coffee I have ever had.

The Hotel is even more beautiful and perfectly maintained than online pictures reveal. At check-in the staff was marvelous, securing confidence in the experience to come. Important point - stay anywhere in Key West and you are surrounded by water - within a short walk. So, since you are likely to only sleep (etc) and shower in your room, choose the cheapest version. I wouldnt pay for the view. You won't see it in the dark! We chose a partial ocean view in building A on the second floor. It has a small balcony. The room was modern, well apointed, and oh my GOD the beds were heavenly! be aware however, the ocean view is UBER partial....but who cares? We enjoyed the beach - like most places in the Keys the beach is manufactured with sea wall protection. This is not a bad thing folks. You are guaranteed privacy! At this location there is a public beach right next door that fits the bill nicely if you are in the mood for an ocean swim. The lawn area faces West and this is where the sunset entertainment takes place between 4 and sunset. In January the sun sets at about 6, so we had a few drinks, listened to the talented C.W. Colt and then took a nice walk up Duval Street to choose a dinner location. We also enjoyed the SPA. I was attened to in the cabana on the beach, my wife in the spa. Once again, a terrific experience. The Hotel operates a Cafe on the public beach as well. The food is excellent and upon check in you will get some value for dinner in the way of a special coupon. We enjoyed breakfast at the bar and lunch as well. The Mount Gay rum and Mango frozen daquiri was to die for. Try it! Upon check out we reflected on the quiet evenings and quiet room, the comfort and luxurious surroundings, the romantic feel, the pools (there are three - and one of them is for adults only), the entertainment, the service and all - and decided this was our place - our place for all future visits to Cayo Huest!

So we got there a few hours before check-in. Me and my husband went to the front desk and ask about checking in early. Although we weren't able to check in yet, we were given our parking pass and keys to the hotel to get to the pools and beach. So we spent the next 2 hours walking throughout the hotel, and up and down Duvall Street. When we came back to check in, we received a complimentary upgrade to a bigger room, room 301, which was an amazing surprise! The suite was absolutely amazing! Super clean, had a balcony facing the beach. It was first class ALL THE WAY! The hotel itself is literally off Duvall street, and right off the beach. It was the best of both worlds!! We didn't drive a single place, we kept our car parked and walked on Duvall Street for lunch and dinner, and spent breakfast at the restaurant/diner at the Southermost hotel. I did spent a few hours at one of the pools at the hotel. Of course I stayed at the pool next to the bar so I could have drinks while sun bathing. They had a small band playing throughout the day. The bartenders were wonderful, served some amazing drinks at decent prices. I ordered 3 drinks for under $20.00, which is a great price for a 5 star hotel. The wait staff was excellent as well. The waitstaff around the pool were very friendly and accommodating, bringing towels and picking up empty glasses. The restaurant at the hotel was on the beach, 100 feet from the water!

It was a last minute vacation, booked just two days before arrival, and we were able to get the last westlawn ocean-front room. Our room was on the second floor with beautiful ocean front views. The balcony is shared between several rooms, which disappointed us, and there was always a crowd of guests on the balcony in front of our room at sunset. However, we were able to use it during the day. We will stay on the bottom floor next time. The hotel is definitely the best beach hotel in Key West. The beach is small but very clean and mostly used by hotel guests. Fletcher will set you'll with lounge chairs free of charge, and umbrellas cost $10. The sand is white and the water is turquoise, even in November. The pool is very clean and lined with palm trees. Towel service always has a clean towel for you and the bar waitress comes around frequently. The bartenders at Shores bar are friendly to all and make the perfect tropical drinks. We ate lunch at the bars on two different occasions and the food was good. We ate at the hotel's restaurant for Thanksgiving dinner and had a great meal. The rooms are very clean and the beds are comfortable. Our room was pretty quiet once the balcony noise died down. Every night at sunset there is live music (guitar-plays mix of tropical and classic feel good tunes) on the westlawn. There are hammocks and chairs to sit while enjoying the music. The service at the hotel was phenomenal-from the front desk, to the pool/bar staff, to restaurant staff, to housekeeping, we were treated royaly. We received extra towels when asked, late check-out, and access to their gym facilities to change intoour swimwear when we arrived before check-in. We were always treated with a smile.

The Southernmost on the Beach is hands-down the most well managed hotel I have stayed (and I travel considerably for work) and it shows in everything they do. The rooms are fantastic (maintenance and housekeeping keep the rooms appearing brand new), the service is phenomenal, the food is perfect and the location is the best in Key West. On this trip our \"perfect experience\" began with Coleen at the front desk. She greeted us with a smile and it was obvious that her only concern was to make sure our stay was incredible. The level of detail is such that although the computer didn't recognize us a return guests (the room was in my last name on our last visit) she sent chocolates to our room with a note welcoming us back to the property. She went out of her way to accommodate our room requests and never made us feel like she was inconvenienced. When we reached our room it was perfect as always. The decor was upscale as was the quality of the room. The HDTV (actually connected to HD programming) was a touch not seen often enough even at the finest chain hotels. Their bathrooms are large (and extremely clean) and include a huge tile shower (one of my favorite parts of the room!). Our balcony had a great view of the ocean beyond the pool. After dropping our bags in the room we quickly headed to the pool area. We were thrilled to see Heather (whom we had met on prior trips) was serving drinks poolside and we received a welcome beyond expectation. I should mention that it was Heather's hospitality three years earlier that sealed the deal that we would be life-long Southernmost on the Beach guests! Prior to that visit we had stayed at the Westin and other upscale hotels-- but spending the afternoons poolside chatting with Heather made us realize that the Southermost was our home away from home! We were disappointed to hear that 2 days of our stay included Heather's off-days but after a quick introduction to James at the pool bar we knew that our stay was not going to be dampened. James jumped in right where Heather left off! He made wonderful drinks and provided great conversation. Like Heather, James makes you feel as if you are right at home talking with a close friend. My posting wouldn't be complete if I didn't also mention Rich, the manager of the pool bar, who has clearly made great hiring decisions! We also appreciated Rich's hospitality during our visit. I cannot highly enough recommend Southernmost on the Beach! Plan a trip-- you will not be disappointed!

We stayed overlooking the west lawn, which was an amazing place to listen to live music and watch the sunset. The pool was decently heated (it could be warmer), but the ocean was fairly choppy this time of year and only cleared up for nice swimming for about half of one day. The grounds are well kept and the hotel had nice drinking water available in a couple of spots, which is really nice compared to some places trying to sell $3 bottled water.. Drinks at the poolside bar were decently priced, especially considering the happy hour specials. Their private peir is also a great place to watch a sunrise and sunset, which you can see both of in the winter months. The only surprise with the room was were many of the rooms had exterior entrances and not all the rooms had a private balcony. The room was nicely decorated, had a good shower, excellent bedding, had a nice flat screen television (that actually had HD TV on it). They served complimentary coffee at the pool from 6-9 and kept an ample supply in room, both of which were better than average. I only have a few complaints that keep this place from getting five stars from me: 1) We saw all these people on rafts to float around the pool and thought they would be included, then was dissapointed when I found out they cost $10 each. 2) We were also surprised at some of the trashier elements here for a hotel at this price point, there were ladies that were very drunk and yelling things that shouldn't be said around children. There were staff members that saw this and didn't do anything about it. We don't have kids, but were still surprised the staff let it go on. I guess if you can get to Key West on a greyhound bus, you're going to get some of this element anywhere you stay. 3) There were two guests that used the small sitting area outside our room to chain smoke for two or three hours for the last two days at sunset, which caused our non-smoking room to smell like they were inside our room. There was also a really roudy bunch that swiped the chairs from outside our room and took them somewhere for one evening.

I can't speak highly enough about this place. The rooms are beautiful, clean, large, perfectly located. The staff have always been nothing but professional, friendly and courteous. We have stayed here three times and it is by far our favorite hotel. On this trip, they went above and beyond. My partner unfortunately had been ill our entire trip. Our return flight wasn't until 7pm, which meant we would have to leave our hotel room at 11am checkout and spend several hours in the heat and the rain. I went to the front desk and explained our situation and asked if I could extend our stay by one additional day. I was more than willing to pay for a full extra day so that he would not have to spend hours outside, as sick as he was. The man at the front desk (didn't get his name) moved some reservations around and said he would block out our room. When we checked out, I was so pleasantly surprised that they decided not to charge us at all for the extra time, under the circumstances. I have never received this type of first rate service anywhere before. We go to Key West several times each year, and this hotel has more than earned our repeat business and highest recommendations. Actually, they earned it even before this!

The room is very nice with a big comfortable king size bed and our room had a refridgerator which was a nice plus for us to have water/Gatorade handy and cold.

After the 3 hour drive down from Miami Intl we were greeted by Colleen at the front desk. She was great and efficient getting us our room keys ( stayed in room 736-building B ), explaining the grounds and various attraction around the hotel and the amenities at our disposal. So off we went to our room, fist off, parking is available as FCFS- no reserved spots and its free, Handicap parking spots are available thru out. Covered parking is available under 3 of the building, we were fortunate to get a spot under building B by the stairs near our room. Elevator service is available for the first 2 floors but our room was on the third floor and the elevator was at the opposite from where we parked. Anyways the stairs gave us a great daily workout. As a side note, we only used the car once during our weeks stay. Walking is your best mode of transportation. Upon entering the room, we were met with an amazing room but this was beat by the FANTASTIC view this room has to offer, the greens and blues of the sea just took our breaths away. This room has a king bed with ocean front view, if you ever wish to pamper yourself then request this type of room, you will not be disappointed. The room was very clean not overly spacious but still large, separate bar area with a mini fridge, blender, sink and located beneath the sink area. When you do enter the room, you are in a small entry way with a small dresser and to your right is the door leading you into the huge bathroom. Again the bathroom is clean, the shower large enough to hold 6 of your closest friends. Only complaint my wife had was the lighting was somewhat dim for her likes and wished it could have been brighter. The room has a desk area with a little window seat off to the side offering ocean views, a view of the beach and roof tops. Also a large flat screen TV hangs in the corner with a small dresser beneath it. Finally the true treasure of this room is beyond the two glass double entry doors, your very private balcony with the amazing views it gives you day and night. Every morning laying in bed, we would open the doors, letting in the gentle sea breezes and fresh air, as we waited for the morning sky to glow with the rising sun. The maid service to the room is great but never consistent with when in the day it was done or on one day we did call late in the afternoon, as we got missed. 20 minutes after a call to the front desk, we had maid service with a smile and a sincere apology. Every night we did have a turn down service which was a great touch, even down to the chocolate mints left on the pillow. The grounds are beautiful, Ocean side, there is a large sandy area of hammocks loungers with umbrella providing a peaceful setting verses the common pool area which is by the public beach side. The hotel has its own private pier, with lounge chairs and umbrella's. This is one of the best places to capture the morning sun rise for all the photo bugs out there. At the end of the pier are large steps that take you down into the sea water. About 6-7 ft ( 2 metres ) deep. From here you can swim then wade over to the public beach beside the hotel. Finally the pool area for the Southernmost is large with ample seating beside it. (if you go the web site for the Southernmost you can view the area via the web cam ). As mentioned in the past, the attendants are constantly removing the towels from vacant loungers so there were always places for us to sit when we did go down to the pool. There is a bar by the pool offering an array of drinks and food service, also morning coffee is served here free until it runs out. Large beach towels are available off the bar area as well as sun lotion and gift T shirts can be purchased here. An outdoor shower near the bar rounds out the pool area. You also have access to the other pool in the adjacent property belonging to the Southernmost. Steps away from the pool is the public beach. First off its hard to control mother nature and what the tides bring in, so I do give the staff a pat on the back for making a daily attempt to keep it clean. Two tropical storms spinning around us, it was a challenge. As guests to the hotel you have access to the chairs and hammocks on the beach, just remember to show your room card, public patrons have to pay for the use. To the left in the water by the beach it is rocky but to the right and further out it is just sandy. You can wade out for a fair bit, no sudden drop off to fear. To the left of the beach, you will find a public pier. The public beach also has the Southernmost Cafe which the staff will recommend for all your dinning. Here you can have breakfast, lunch and dinner service. Full bar service is found here also. The service we found here to be great and attentive. The menu is large for all services and there should be something on it for you. The food is average but not bad, as we did try to have at least one type service each during our stay, every time getting a table by the ocean. Cafe also prepares the pool orders, with runners going back and forth regularly. With so many food options available do not worry if this does not match your palate. We know as we did go food exploring but this was a great fall back if time was short. Getting around from the hotel is easy. This being our first time to KW, we chose this hotel for its quiet side of the key. Which meant most attractions and eateries are on the opposite side, so prepare yourself for a lot of walking. Do not think of driving as parking spots are very hard to find. Duval street is the main drag and Southernmost is on it, so you really can't get lost, just start walking. Walking will take you 20-30 minutes to reach the other end by the major pier. Here is where you can watch the sun go down or stare at the large cruise ships that come into port daily, go shopping, eat, drink and have lots of fun. So walking is free, a pedicab to the other end of the Duval street will just cost you over $30 with tip, one way and takes about 15 minutes. Or can take a cab, this will cost just over $10 with tip and its a 5 minute car ride. Bike and scooter rentals are available across the street and throughout the key. Many choices for many budgets and depending on how tired your legs are from all the walking you will do. Public transit is available but we did not investigate it. The hotel concierge service, we used for restaurant recommendations and reservation. We were never disappointed and the tables reserved were great. Colleen at the front desk is a good source for things to do as well. The day before we left we needed to print up our boarding passes. Colleen gave us directions to the business centre across the street at the adjacent Southernmost property. Here you have free access to the internet and can print up your boarding passes. If you have any difficulty using the computer, staff are at hand to help. Being our first visit to Key West, Southernmost made it a great vacation, Thank you and we are looking forward to a return to the hotel in the near future.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Riverside, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel, Friendly Staff, We'll be back!\u201d", "Author": "KWest_Dreamer", "ReviewID": "UR117956413", "Content": "Beautiful Hotel on the water with stunning views of the Atlantic.

Don't expect a microwave and the \"coffee pot\" was less than desirable but there is a fridge and you can grab a cup o'joe at the beach restaurant on grounds. Our balcony was spacious, suspended above the sea offering lovely sunrise and sunset views. A constant ocean breeze keeps the noseeums and mosquitos at bay. I like the pier jutting into the sea with a row of lawn chairs and tables for comfort and a stairway directly into the water. Hammocks are scattered across the grounds under lovely, swaying palm trees. Some people chose to sleep in the hammocks all night because it's so beautiful and peaceful. The food at the restaurant was delicious. You can walk into town but after doing it once we chose to use the ubiquitous bicycle rick-shaws. I recommend the Conch Train Tour and visiting the Hemingway House. You can also rent a car and drive up to Marathon Key for a wonderful dinner at the Sunset Grill with a view of 7-mile bridge and a parade of sailboats.

The rooms were very nice and big and maintained very well. The bathroom was also very big, with a nice sized shower and bench. There was no tub in our room, and our \"ocean view\" was a very small piece of the ocean we were able to see over the top of another building. We stayed on the second floor of building \"D\". The staff was very nice. Happy hour drinks at the bar were reasonable, but this is the only time I would recommend getting drinks there. The drink prices were a little rediculous for regular priced drinks. If they would lower the price to something a bit more reasonable, I'm sure they would sell way more drinks. The drinks were good though, but we usually only got one and split it while at the pool during non happy hour. The pool was great and we spent most of our sun time there. The beach area in front of the cafe had a ton of seaweed that washed up that no one seemed to want to clean up. So when we did get in the ocean, we got in by way of the private pier, which put you in over your head, so we didn't stay in too long. Being at the far end of Duvall street wasn't too bad, but it did get annoying b/c all of the excursions and tours we did were at the opposite end. So that is something to think about if you will be doing alot of activities. My only other complaint was the shower pressure. If you're a female, you know how important this is. This wasn't the worst I have ever had, but definitely notable. Also there were these tiny, almost clear, ants in the room on the counter tops and dresser. Not sure where they came from, but there were always a few around. Oh, and I did inquire about a manicure at the spa... $40 for a regular manicure. I skipped it.

We were greeted at Reception by Dexter who went out of his way to explain the hotel facilities, including those at the Southernmost Hotel across the street whose facilities we were also entitled to use. He even looked up two restaurants which had been recommended to us so we would have addresses and phone numbers for them. At first I was disappointed in our room location, as it was on the first floor, but I soon realized that our view of the ocean was still lovely. But, if we return to Southernmost on the Beach, I will go through the phone reservation system and request a second floor room, if available. Our room was lovely, spotlessly clean and kept that way by the housekeeping staff. My only complaint about the room itself was that there were no chairs aside from the desk chair. But, the way the headboard was made, it was comfortable to sit on the bed to watch TV in the evening. The bathroom was amazing, with a huge shower and separate tub with whirlpool jets. We appreciated the free wi-fi in our hotel room, and also the free parking\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6not a small perk when most hotels charge for parking. The location of the hotel was perfect, at one end of Duval Street, easily accessible to restaurants and attractions. We especially loved the Butterfly conservatory. That is a not-to-be-missed experience with many colorful butterflies flying all around, along with beautiful birds. We swam in the ocean off of the pier which was near our room, and also used the Southernmost on the Beach pool, which was lovely. We could also have used two pools located at the Southernmost Hotel. It was nice to be able to enter the ocean directly from the pier, as the beach next door was marred by huge amounts of seaweed on the shore, and in the shallow part of the ocean. They did work in the mornings to rake and remove the seaweed, but it was a losing battle. We had three breakfasts at the Southernmost Beach Caf\u00c3\u00a9 and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Our three different servers were all very attentive and pleasant, and the food was plentiful, tasty and reasonably priced. The restaurant is open-air, which was lovely in the morning to feel the breeze and watch the ocean. It might have been a bit hot to eat there later in the day. We would love to return to the Southernmost on the Beach Hotel, but will probably schedule that in the winter. August is a very oppressive time to be in the Keys, with heat indices over 100 most days.

The staff at the pools (thanks Louis), the cafe (thanks Katie), the front desk ( thanks Wally, Scarlett and Julie!) were all wonderful, helpful and pleasant! I mention the FABULOUS beds because we frequently travel to Mexico where the beds are made by the Flintstones Mattress Company - hard as bedrock! LOL! These were like sleeping on a cloud! A few things to note: Happy hour at the Southernmost Cafe is wonderful - inexpensive and DELICIOUS - say \"Pelican Wings !! Breakfast is cheaper if you eat there as well - KEY WEST IS EXPENSIVE to feed a family, and there were only three of us! I will however, recommend the Banana Cafe, a few blocks heading down Duval towards town (French crepes and omelettes, lunchfare...and dinner) I truthfully could have eaten every meal here I thought is ws heavenly! I will also tell you somethng to be aware of: If you are looking for delicous conch chowder like we were - EVERYONE on the island prepares a MANHATTAN STYLE chowder - RED BASE, not WHITE chowder! Just know that, so if it's not your favorite, you don't go around ordering it and then being disappointed. Still speaking of CONCH - there inthe Conch Republic - the best conch fritters in my opinion are to be found at the Old Mexican Cafe on Duval Street closer to Mallory Square. All of the food at this Cafe was delicious and moderately priced. Two other notewrothy places to eat : Two Friends Restaurant (moderate AND delicious) and on the expensive side, Hot Tin Roof near the pier - the food was great and the view of the sunset is without compare!

We arrived at the hotel around noon and were able to check in immediately. Dexter at the front desk helped us and was very friendly. We loved our room, which was in building \u00e2\u20ac\u0153C\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd on the 2nd floor \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Room 620. It overlooked the ocean and the beach. The beds are SO comfortable, thus I never wanted to get out of bed in the morning! There was a huge flat screen TV at the foot of the bed \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice feature adding to the lovely accommodations. The bathroom itself was small, but the shower was large and beautifully tiled. I like how the shower and toilet were kept separate from the sink/vanity because it made it easier for 2 people to get showered and dressed in the room. Not only are the rooms comfortable and well-decorated, but they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re extremely clean. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a single complaint about our room. The pool at this hotel was wonderful! It was very big, allowing for plenty of space between other guests in the pool. Although a lot of the chairs were reserved with towels, we always were able to find 2 together. I also noticed hotel employees taking towels off the chairs that were unoccupied for long periods of time. I was impressed, as so many resorts I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been to allow guests to reserve chairs with towels even when they disappear for hours. There is a basketball net on the shallow end of the pool, which was pretty cool. I also like how the pool ranged from about 3 feet to 7 feet. It was nice that they had a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153deep end\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to swim around in, unlike many hotels I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve visited. The pool area also often had live music and we really enjoyed it! One day there were steel drums, another day there was a guy playing acoustic guitar. Obviously, the pool at this hotel was a huge plus! The Shores Bar was the cherry on top! Though we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t swim in the other pools within the rest of their properties, we did walk through and they looked just as nice and entertaining. I initially booked this hotel because it was located on the beach, but I was somewhat disappointed with what I saw. Obviously nobody can help the fact that seaweed washes up on shore, but I never saw any employee attempting to rake the seaweed up, as I have at resorts in other destinations. I was surprised because I saw 2 weddings on the beach \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which were beautiful by the way \u00e2\u20ac\u201c but the seaweed on the beach was just distracting to me. It kept me from ever sunbathing or swimming there, which again, was my reason for choosing this particular hotel. Instead, we rented bikes through the concierge in the hotel lobby and rode over to Fort Zachary Taylor State Park. That beach there is very nice, but super rocky. As silly as they might look, your best bet is to wear water shoes there. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Southernmost on the Beach. Aside from the beach itself, the property is gorgeous and its convenient location on the quiet end of Duval is PERFECT. Rent a bike right from the concierge and ride around the island.

There are a couple of things to point out that the resort can easily and should definitely address/improve. The first disappointment is the pool area. The resort has a great pool w/ a tiki bar that is right on the ocean. However, the resort makes no effort to control access and restrict usage to only hotel guests. This is very problematic because pool chairs get reserved and occupied very early by non-hotel guests, even though the pool rules state that usage is reserved exclusively for guests. The pool and hotel staff were even aware that non-guests had removed items from a hotel guests chair and moved their belongings, however made no effort to rectify the problem. This was a big disappointment, especially if you planning a vacation where you want to just relax by the pool. Second, the hotel towels and linens should definitely be changed. The linens are not the best thread count/quality but this can be overlooked. The towels were just simply awful. The bath towels are basically oversized hand towels and are not large enough. The texture of all of the room towels are comparable to sand paper. Especially after getting some sun, they feel awful on your skin. This is another flaw that could easily be fixed by the hotel.

Our journey started over a year ago, when we were greeted with smiling faces while searching for a wedding venue and continued until the last guest left. The whole staff was exceptional but a few people really were even more exceptional. Carrie-thank you for your relaxed and informative presentation; you has us at hello! Judi-thank you for your patience in getting all of our family and friends rooms during one of the busiest weekends of the year and special thanks from the bride and groom for the upstairs suite in La Mer. What a dream for a bride getting ready for her wedding day followed by waking up as Mrs. with a view from her balcony of the ocean. The rooms have been beautifully renovated and are so comfortable. Miguel-thank you for lugging all of my mother-of-the-bride stuff everywhere and the recommendation for Sandy's Cuban sandwich and cafe con leche! And Melissa-the coordinator extraordinaire! Thank you for your tenacity and attention to following up on details, returning phone calls and looking for solutions to all of my issues (and there were many). Your ability to make us feel like we were your only clients was amazing, given that the hotel was abuzz with it being the Songwriters Festival time. As we have heard back from our guests, all would agree that the setting for the ceremony and reception on the beach was perfect for our 100+ party. Reviews for the laua celebration buffet were outstanding-everything was beautifully presented and absolutely delish! The plantains seemed to be a real crowd pleaser! The morning after breakfast at the Gingerbread Pool was another delight. Thanks for serving up the leftover cupcakes from the night before! Yummy! Overall, the plan of the hotel was a perfect match for our event because we all spent more time being together instead of getting lost trying to find this place or that place. There was something rather magical and intimate about being surrounded by those we love and yet other guests could watch from their balconies or the side yard while the festivities occurred. It was heart-warming to have \"strangers\" clapping, which added to the cheers and good wishes after the ceremony. I actually \"participated\" in a ceremony several evenings before. It was so cool! Nothing was ever too far away. The Bistro, pools with bars, tanning on the beach or a quick swim in the ocean off the point. And yet, the southern end of Duval was across the street if guests were looking for more adventure. The only thing wrong with our stay at Southernmost is that it had to end.

I found their web cam of the pool and we gathered around every night of the week before to watch and fantasize about being there. We drove straight from Ohio and were extremely tired until we got to the hotel and saw how beautiful it was. Our kids were estatic and check in was quick and pleasant. Our room was on the second floor and our balcony gave us a wonderful view of the pool and although the description said \"partial ocean view\", I was blown away by how gorgeous the view was of the ocean. We could have cared less what the room looked like, but it was very nice and clean and perfect! Our only regret was not getting an ajoining room for the kids instead of having them in our room, lol. The staff were very friendly and helpful and we made friends with Sean from the pool, who told us all the best places for everything, and gave us valuable information when we said we wanted to move there. We even had a date night with him and his wife on our last night, which was very very cool. The bartender Emmit was excellent! and always made my drink as soon as I approached the bar at the pool, which I forgot to mention, the pool, was heaven, warm and crystal clear and magnificent. The absolute best thing was the pier right to the ocean. We loved that you could walk right down the steps into the perfectly crystal clear water which our kids loved that it was only waist deep. I would never ever stay anywhere else after experiencing the Southernmost on the Beach. We all literally cried as we were driving away from it, and plan on returning very soon.

I know this because a 3 year old's toy seem to be in every nook and cranny. Not sure why they don't show the bathrooms on the website because the shower area is incredible. Someone mentioned that the wifi didn't work. There is wifi for each room that is very weak and requires no password, but the one for the entire hotel is very fast.

There is a very nice sandy area but the entry into the water is treacherous! The pool area is very nice and the waiter (can not remember his name) was very friendly and noticed when we weren't there one day. You have to try the Bloody Mary from the Shores Bar (poolside)! Definitely do the Beer School with Boomer on Wednesday. Free beer and lots of fun. One bad experience on day #2 when the pool bar did not open at 10am. I asked the guy handing out the towels when it opened and he said maybe 11 or 12? The advertised open was 10am. I called the front desk at 11am and asked when the bar opened and she told me 10am. I explained that I was sitting across the pool from it and it was not even thinking of opening. She was extremely baffled and apologized profusely. Needless to say, it opened about 10 minutes later. I was upset only because I wanted to try the famous Bloody Mary!! The Southernmost Beach Cafe has absolutely incredible food. You have to try the nachos and the coconut shrimp! However, they really need to address the hostesses. Maybe they were running on Key West time? Every time we ate there we stood at the hostess stand while the hostess (2 different ones) walked by us, stacked menus, serviced tables, etc all while the line at the stand gets longer and longer. Those duties could have been done later or by someone else. Just tell me what you're doing or when you're going to be helping me! Absolutely no apology for waiting or even any clue that we were ticked off. But again, the food was ridiculous. Everything was homemade and seasoned to perfection.

Each room has free wireless internet, which is so helpful in planning your time on the island. Most of the rooms have private balconies or a balcony of some sort. The views from our rooms have been nothing less than stunning, and the grounds themselves are very well kept. The pool is so nice and my favorite place to be! There is a nice little beach on the property. My only complaint is the beach has a lot of seagrass, but this seems to be the norm for the beaches in the area and SMOTB is making a good attempt at keeping their's as clean as possible. The cafe on the property has good food, a great staff and a very yummy key lime pie. We ate there for lunch a couple times on this last trip. It's nice not to have to stray too far before spending the afternoon at the pool or beach. Every member of their staff from the front desk to housekeeping to bartenders are all kind and helpful and treat you like family. The rooms are not cheap, but not the most expensive in KW either.

Loved it!! I am a General Manager of a hotel (think large, international - starts with a M) so I have an insider perspective on most every experience a guest can have. I can assure your, from our experience here, this hotel is expertly managed and staffed with high quality, well trained staff from housekeeping, to food service, to front desk and maintenance. I could sense the professionalism and dedication to guest satisfaction not just in our interactions, but through observation of interactions with other guests. My husband and I are avid Tripadvisor stalkers and chose SMOTB because of what we read in reviews. To some reviewers all I can say is \"lighten up\" No place will be perfect, especially night over night - just roll with it. We booked a west lawn ocean view room, that's what we got, we asked for an upper floor, we got first floor - ok. The hotel was sold out several nights we could have gone back to the lobby and asked for a room change but we decided to \"roll with it\" and it turned out we were happier on the first floor anyway- what did we know. Our first day we enjoyed sitting in the lounge chairs on the lawn, the first evening a rather large wedding group sat up in the chairs drinking and socializing until very early in the morning. Did I mention we are early to bed and up for the sunrise sort of people? The next day, to prepare for some constuction the hotel had planned on the lawn, the chairs were gone. Bummer, we thought at first, but you know we didn't experience any more noisy wedding groups outside our room. And this hotel does a LOT of weddings. The chairs were still missing 5 days into our stay, but each night was quiet and we slept well. There were a few times that beach access was limited due to weddings on the sand and once the cafe closed early for a fundraising event. OK, so there are only a gazillion other places on Key West to eat, no inconvenience there at all. Only once were we inconvenienced and that was by some other rude guest that thought it would be just fine to lock their rental bike to my husband's and my bike. We hadn't rented bikes, they were a gift from a friend who lives on the island for us to use during the week. We were scheduled to be at the dock for our excursion to the Dry Tortugas at 7:15 am, went to get our bikes and couldn't access them because whoever had rented #38 was too lazy to properly lock their bike the evening before. We went to the front desk, pretty mad and anxious that we weren't going to make our boat. A pair of bolt cutters would have been nice to have at that moment. The front desk acted immediately, though they were unable to do anything about the lock situation ( the rental company is a third party company) the night manager was getting off shift and he offered to drive us to the harbor, they even insisted we take cash to call a taxi for our ride home. Honestly, I can't imagine anyone saying the front desk staff was not accommodating or helpful. Bottom line, staying in Key West is expensive, hotels, food, drinking, shopping: everything. If you can't be happy at $400 a night, you won't be happy at $600 a night and certainly not happy at $100 a night.

We stayed in an oceanfront king room in the new building and were very happy wife the room. I will admit that it pricey but I have stayed in other hotels in Key West and it is in line with other great rooms in the area. Where this hotel beats the others is in its service and cleanliness. The housekeeping is top notch from the towel animals to the absolutely spotless bathrooms. The nightly turn down service includes chocolates on your pillows and is down with a smile. The balconies in these rooms are huge and have lounge chairs and single chairs with small tables. The water pressure is a bit low but the place has to have a flaw. The AC worked flawlessly. The activities are handles by Boomer McFall and he does a great job. We had a great time at Beer School (free tasting), Wine School (free tasting again) and we even played The Newleywed Game which we won (free t shirts and some other nice perks). There are many other free activities during the week. The Cafe has some of the best food in Key West. We had great breakfasts each morning (going to be tough to work it off). The special is pancakes, 3 eggs, corned beef hash (real chunks of freshly made corned beef), a generous portion of melon balls, and the biggest english muffins that you will ever see all for about 10 bucks. In Key West that is a bargain and you get to eat it in there beachfront cafe looking at the ocean. We had dinner there on our last night and the filet mignon was superb along with the perfectly cooked scallops. The pools are great (you have a choice of 3) or you can swim in the ocean from the beach. The pier is lined with lounge chairs and great for catching rays and it even has a stairway into the ocean to cool yourself off. The parking here is free and it is a bit of a walk to Mallory Square on a hot day but that may have been the breakfast talking. There are nice bars at all of the pools and the drink prices are average. Julie and Scarlet at the concierge desk are well informed and always eager to help. While you are the pool search out Omar and ask him to sing some of his favorite songs for you. This man is one of the nicest people that I have met in all of my travels and he never has anything but a smile on his face. SMOTB I hope you know how lucky you are to have him.

Overall, this is a very, very nice property. The only down side was the check in. There was a very long wait to do so due to the fact there was only one clerk on duty. Waited almost 20 minutes to check in. Also, people considering staying at this property should note that it is at the opposite end of the island for the action, which was just great for us.

The easy access to the beach and large pool/bar area was perfect! This is not something that you can get everywhere in Key West since there are not large beaches on the island. Our family and friends really enjoyed the Shores Bar and the Beach Cafe. We enjoyed drinks and meals (breakfast/lunch) at both locations. Everything was excellent--especially the Key Lime Colodas and Bloody Marys (very spicy!!). Rich was our bartender throughout the week and we really enjoyed his company and his friendly service. We also took advantage of the activities that the resort offered pool and beach side. The wine and beer school were very fun and informative. The entertainment by the pool (steel drum band/juggling lessons), was also very enjoyable. Our room was number 638, which is an oceanfront king. My wedding party and family got ready for the wedding in this room, which comfortably accomodated 8-9 guests plus our stylists throughout the day. The room was clean/comfortable, with a wonderful, large balcony.

Due to a medical emergency in Philadelphia and horrific incoming weather, we missed our connecting flight in NC and had to fly standby. (Not a great way to start a vacation.) However, once we arrived at the hotel, everything that happened prior to our arrival was completely forgotten. We were greeted immediately, informed about the various activities, and given a layout of all the ammenities - then given our key to paradise! (I had planned this vacation back in September for our 50th birthday celebration.) I booked an oceanfront room and that is exactly what we received. A beautifully decorated new oceanfront room with a king size bed, a small two chair with table area, desk, flat screen TV, wetbar area, hidden small refrigerator and in-room safe, wrap around balcony, and an oversize bathroom with large walk-in shower. The room was spotless and the air conditioning was set at a perfect temperature. On the balcony were 2 chairs with a small table and two lounge chairs. The view was spectacular! (Room A-539) The entire complex was well manicured and maintained. Plenty of lounge chairs, umbrellas, hammocks, private seating areas, pool chairs, etc throughout the complex. No need to wake up early to secure a seat - many will be available whatever time you decide to venture out. We arrived in time to make happy hour so we quickly changed and walked over to enjoy rum swizzles and vodka & cranberry drinks and some outstanding hot wings. Each item - only $3 each! The bartenders were friendly and attentive and the locals were the same. Everyone there was there for the same reason - to just kick back and relax and have a good time. Happy hour is from 4-7 everyday. We did not rent a car or scooter our entire vacation and did not miss having one. We walked Duval Street every day/night. It took us about 20 minutes one way to walk the entire street. While the streets were filled with people, restaurants did not require any waiting or reservations. If you have never visited Key West, the best way to describe Duval Street is to say it's an adult's playground - restaurant after restaurant, bar after bar, and a ton of live music playing from each place. Of course there are plenty of stores to shop as well. There are so many places to see and the sunset at Mallory Square is a must for the first time vacationer to Key West. Not wanting to lock into any time constraints, my husband and I chose activities we could do on the fly. We took a Conch Train Tour (about 90 minutes and $30/pp) that taught us a lot about the island. We didn't love it but it was informative. Also, next door to the Southernmost on the Beach, we rented Wave-runners and took a Water tour. I highly recommend that you do this. We booked through the hotel but you can save $10 if you just walk over and sign up. (This was also about 90 minutes and $130 for one wave-runner with two people.) If you are a Philadelphia fan, stop by Pat Croce's Rum Barrel Restaurant and catch a game and good food. Sloppy Joe's is another Key West landmark and usually has great live music. A great little deli/liquor/convenience store is across the street from the hotel. We purchased 12-packs , deli items, and breakfast items all at very reasonable prices. There was always something going on around the pool area. We did not take advantage of any of the activities. We were happiest on the beach, in the water, relaxing, and drinking. Night time was peaceful and quiet. Every single day was beautiful. High of 84 degrees with a nice warm breeze and sunny. Don't forget the sunscreen...saw lots of people who apparently did! We usually go on vacation and towards the end of our vacation we're looking forward to going home; not on this vacation. Would have loved to have stayed longer.

The pool area is clean and sparkling with plentiful lounge chairs with excellent pool-side service and good food. The food and table service at the open-air restaurant on the beach, where we ate breakfast every day and dined twice at night, was likewise outstanding and reasonably priced.

Located at the southernmost end of Duval Street, the hotel is within easy walking distance of many attractions you won't want to miss, including the Hemingway house and the Butterfly Museum, and the walk to the historic end of Duval is an easy 15-20 minute stroll from the hotel. If you prefer to take a taxi, it's short $10-$12 ride to the marina at Mallory Square. Be sure to go there one evening to see the famous Key West sunset and enjoy the many performing artists (don't miss the cat man's show--he has cats doing some tricks you would not think cats would be willing to do), after which you can find many great dock-side restaurants for dinner.

There is a shared balcony outside of the room with seating, which allowed us to view the ocean, as well as the action at the beach, lawn, and pool. Bathroom was on the small side, but shower was big and beautiful. Vanity was located outside of the bathroom, which was very convenient, but not much storage for our toiletries. Also, not a lot of places to hang wet towels, bathing suits, etc. The hotel is located adjacent to one of the only beaches in Key West. It is a public beach, but hotel guests get beach chairs and towels for free. The hotel's pool was very lively and crowded at all hours of the day. We ended up using the pool across the street at another of the hotel's properties and were very pleased - it was less crowded and much more quiet and peaceful, which suited our needs. We found it great that guests from all of the properties the hotel owns (Southernmost Hotel on the Beach, Southernmost Hotel, La Mer, and Dewey House) have access to the amenities from all of the other properties. All are located adjacent to one another. We actually may try staying at one of the smaller properties on our next stay, but we would also be just as satisfied staying at Southernmost on the Beach again. Also, we tried the hotel's restaurant (Southernmost Cafe on the Beach) on our last night and were pleasantly surprised at how delicious the food was and at how great the prices were - there was excellent service and it was a great value; plus it's one of the only Key West dining options located right on the beach with beautiful ocean views. Overall, we had an excellent stay. What is great about Southermost is that you get to stay at a wonderful, high-end resort with more of a personal feel (nice that it's not a big chain - no resort fee and free parking!). The hotel was a bit trendier and more crowded than we typically like, but the ocean views, service, and access to all of the desired amenities definitely kept us satisfied and very happy guests.

The location is very good - love having that little cuban stand across the street where we could enjoy a cheap meal and cuban coffee every morning. Also we LOVE El Sibonney cuban restaurant and it's only a 10 minute walk. We did not rent a car and did not miss it at all. Service was great - Heather by the pool was awesome. If you are really going for Duval street nightlife everynite, I do not recommend this hotel. Yes, you can walk there, but it can be hot, you can be tired, etc. If I was going for the nightlife for every nite, I recommend staying closer to that end of Duval. If you are going to pay $300 a night, I would stay closer. Here are the things we did not like: toiletries were cheap - definitely bring your own. Internet connection was pretty bad - I travel all around the world and never have issues, but I got all kinds of weird messages from their server. It's free though. Also we were placed in a handicapped room, so the bathroom was not great. Definitely confirm you will be a reg room, with a vanity. There was no place to set anything. Also they say coffee pot on amenities, but it's not a coffee pot. It's this little coffee maker that uses weird cartridges, so although you can have a cup of coffee in your room, you can't bring coffee and filters and make it in your room. Overall, we would stay here again!", "Date": "April 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cPerfect stay with no spring breakers!\u201d", "Author": "Kellygreen24", "ReviewID": "UR102677900", "Content": "Drove to Key West and once we saw hotel we wished we were staying longer than 4 days!

The high rating is definitely earned. A relatively new property, we knew we had chosen well when our cab driver from the airport immediately said \"that's a nice place\" when we told him our destination. The hotel is arranged in several buildings. We opted for a room with an ocean view. The room was spacious with a large bathroom, king size bed, and private balcony. There's plenty to do at the hotel itself. They have a great pool area that stays open late (11 PM) with a full bar attached and great service throughout the day. You can also opt for similar pools at other Southernmost Collection properties nearby. There's a small private beach area at the hotel. The hotel is next to one of Key West's public beaches that seemed to stay fairly crowded the whole time we were there. The hotel is near all the 'southernmost' attractions on the island - just a couple blocks from the famous \"90 miles to Cuba\" buoy. You're at the quiet end of Duval Street, about a 10-20 minute walk to the rowdier parts. You can also opt to rent a bicycle on property or jump in a pedicab to shorten your ride and save some shoe leather. There are a lot of good spots to eat just a few blocks from the hotel. You're also about a 5 minute walk to a CVS for any sundries you might need. Service at the hotel was outstanding. We arrived before check in time. They stored our luggage and gave us a key card that got us into the fitness area, pool, and other areas as needed. They did the same when we checked out but had a long wait for our flight. Staff is friendly and seems to go out of their way to make you feel welcome. My only complaints...the hotel seemed noisy in the morning with trucks arriving for delivery, carts rolling along, and doors opening and slamming shut. I was awakened a few times around 6-7 AM with people getting ready for the day. Not so much a complaint, but a word of advice - there's a lot to see and do in Key West. I feel like we spent so much time out of our room, we didn't really get the full value for what we were paying. I don't regret staying at the hotel at all, but if I had to choose again I would likely consider either one of the property's less expensive room choices or a less expensive option on one of the other Southernmost properties.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lehigh Valley PA", "Title": "\u201cKey West waterfront stay - beautiful and relaxing\u201d", "Author": "Frank_and_Michele", "ReviewID": "UR101427534", "Content": "My wife and I spent 4 nights at SMOTB.

Concierge Scarlett did a nice job booking a fishing trip for us. Pool staff friendly and good. Same for the Cafe Bar & Restaurant. The bar/restaurant is owned by the hotel owners.

Lounge chairs and hammocks. The quiet end of Duval Street is a block away. Walk north toward Mallory Square/cruise ships/college kids. Stop at Vino's for some wine.

We had approx 54 room nights booked accommodating approx. 40 of our friends that stayed here to attend our wedding. Not one of our friends was disappointed. They have managed to retain the pre-renovation charm even though the hotel has grown considerably. Things to consider when planning your stay here; When we return we will not select the expensive suites that overlook the ocean on the ends of the buildings. I believe it might be better to stay at the medium priced rooms that overlook the Beach area (still has ocean view). The rooms that run along the beach side provide great views, easy access to beach pool, and have nice relaxing grassy area within steps of the room. Eat breakfast at the Beachside Cafe on the hotel grounds - moderately priced, excellent service and very quick seating relative to local alternatives. Have at least one Quesadilla for lunch - one of the best anywhere! You will not need a car. The hotel location is near the opposite end of Duval, taxis frequent the front desk areas, and Pedi cabs are in abundance. Note; Negotiate your Pedi cab fare prior to the ride - especially for women. My two large friends and I took a Pedi cab from one end of Duval to the other for $13.00 - my new wife and her girlfriend were charged $25.00....hmmmm.

The hotel itself is extremely clean, and the grounds are very well maintained and manicured. Our room was on the second flor and very comfortable. It was a bit loud however as you could easily hear footsteps on the floor above and feel the closing of doors nearby. The front desk staff was excellent as was the restaurant staff. On our final day, our flight did not leave until 5:30p. We were given a key to the exercise room (after our 11am checkout). so that we could shower and change prior to our flight so that we could enjoy the amenities of the hotel/pool/beach during the day. Some basic expectations of a hotel at this price level ($300+ nightly) were missing. No room service. No vending. No turn down service. However these were not major sacrifices and didn't impact the quality of the stay. The location is on the far end of Duval Street and one block to the Southernmost Point marker. We did not rent a car and found everything to be within walking distance. Older visitors or those with disabilites might find sightseeing easier via cab or electric cars (golf carts) that can be rented nearby. It's approximately 1 mile from the hotel to Mallory Square and the far end of Duval. The hotel location is truly at the quiet end of Duval Street, so it will be a bit of a walk to the nightspots and restaurants.

We stayed at the Southernmost on the Beach Hotel. One thing is for certain, we will most definitely stay there again the next time we visit Key West! We rented bikes and traveled around the island checking out a lot of other hotels. We were completely satisfied with our decision to stay at Southernmost on the Beach. The main reason? Location, location, location! This is one of the only (if not the only) hotel in Key West located on a sandy beach. We loved the view of the ocean from both the pool and the beach cafe restaurant. The fact that this hotel was not located in the busy atmosphere of Duval Street was the cherry on top of the wedding cake! We were able to walk to Duval Street and enjoy that atmosphere, but we wanted a more quiet, romantic location for our hotel, and we definitely found it at the Southernmost on the Beach Hotel. Besides location, the staff at the hotel was extremely friendly, fun, and resourceful. Thanks to Dexter at the front desk, to Julie at the consierge desk, to all the awesome bartenders (or mixologists), to the activity director Boomer, we had the best honeymoon get-away we could have hoped for. We especially enjoyed \"Wine School\" by the beach with Boomer. Our only regret is that we missed \"Beer School\" because we were off enjoying the water. But, we will definitely make sure to attend class next time we return to Key West. Finally, Southernmost on the Beach had some other very appealing features. The pool was clean and heated. We were always able to get a beach chair by the pool and on the beach. (Chairs on the beach are free to hotel quests... bonus!) Our favorite thing to do at night was sit by the beautifully lit pool at the bar. Our best meals were at the Beach Cafe restuarant. I could gush on and on and on.... In summary, we highly recommend staying at the Southernmost on the Beach Hotel!

We're very pleased we chose this hotel and will stay here again when we come back to Key West. This was our first time in Key West and it was an awesome place to visit. We arrived around 2 a.m. and the front desk was open and nice in helping us check in and find our room. Below are the pros and cons of our stay. Pros of Southernmost on the Beach -lots of great FREE amenities not at other locations - large terraces with a table and 2 chairs, free parking (some covered), private beach, private pier, pool with ocean view, hammocks with ocean view, free use of South Beach, towels, chairs, beautiful gardens. -location is excellent - quiet side of Duval but walkable from many places -ocean view even though we didn't pay for it -- our \"New Deluxe King Balcony\" room overlooked the parking lot but we could see South Beach and the ocean just as well as that. -actually ON the water, on the south side of the island, by Duval - not many places located like that in Key West -very comfortable bed -spacious room, fridge to use -everything from the beach, the pier and the parking lot were uber clean -friendly and helpful concierge Cons of Southernmost on the Beach -very slow water pressure in the showers - not a big deal for some but I have pretty thick hair and was in there for a while getting all the shampoo and conditioner out. -the shades/drapes aren't completely light blocking like most hotels so when the sun comes up the room isn't dark. -we received a handicapped room although we didn't request it and that means the shower had this huge bench in it that made it very difficult to stand and take a shower, not to mention banging my knee on it several times. -very little counter space around the sink - the sink was stand alone and then there was a glass shelf on the wall next to it -the maid service seemed a little slow on some days - we would leave our room by 9am and come back around 1 or so and the room still wasn't made up. Other: Definitely would recommend Barefoot Billys for the Jet Ski Tour (set up by the concierge), we paid $150 for both of us on one jet ski and a 27 mile, 2 hour tour of the island. Well worth it! At first, I balked at a guided tour but was glad we did as navigating the harbor is dicey and there are lots of reefs and shallow areas in Key West that guide helped us avoid. The guide also had some great history and facts to share about Key West. If you're from a smoke-free city/state, be prepared for lots of smokers in Key West. There seem to be a lot of European travelers who smoke and lots of American smokers who visit and Florida's smoke-free restaurant law seemed to be optional here.

So, for many reasons, I was happy to pick Southernmost on the Beach and not feel bad about the money, for once. It was one of the few hotels that could guarantee two queen beds which were needed for the three of us. Other places could only give us a pull out couch which seemed like a horrible idea. Southernmost on the Beach has: modern Caribbean styling cute and sharp interior design sweet little uncovered porches nice finishes nice pool convenient restaurant, although I didn't try it out great customer service (but seriously everywhere in South Florida people were very polite and pleasant) quite green! with dual flush toilets, recycling containers, room-key based electrical (although this proved a problem when we realized that this meant our fridge turned off too!) Despite these great points, I couldn't believe the water pressure problem we had in the shower! As soon as we realized that the water dribbled through our shower head, I remembered what I thought was an unfair review noting that for the price, it was ridiculous for the shower to be an issue. I now see that this reviewer was not exaggerating. My mother-in-law and I discussed whether Key West had trouble getting enough fresh water and then decided that, regardless, there should be a little sign noting it was a problem if it was. However, I doubt that water pressure is such a general issue because I don't remember people mentioning it. Anyway, I am not being mean-spirited about Southernmost on the Beach. I get why people like it, but in addition to this somewhat minor problem, it was not our style. Let me rephrase, it probably would have suited my in-laws, but my husband and I are much lower key and thrifty (or cheap). While we did pay for a partial ocean view and I was aware that it would be very 'partial', it was unsatisfying to pay for a hotel right on the beach and have this sad sideways view. Plus, we were at the end farthest from from the ocean in one of the close buildings. To us, there was nothing classically 'Key West' about this place. It was clean and lovely and pleasant, but it was also very new and slightly corporate feeling. We really enjoyed Key West, but when we return, we will look for somewhere a little more laid back, a little less party and with a bigger shaded porch with or without a view or AC.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Saint Louis, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cSouthermost Hotel was Awesome!

There are 2 pools, jacuzzi, small beach, and their own sunning pier that also enters the water for snorkeling/swimming. Key West is not known for it's beaches so those that are disappointed with this aspect should read a bit more about the island.

They have free internet access and car parking, a lot of which is conveniently in the shade right under the rooms. One thing to be aware of is that the style of the buildings is a bit like a motel, with access to all the rooms from external areas and walkways rather than the more conventional inside corridor.

Since we arrived early (approx. 12:00...check-in was about 3:00), our first experience was with Omar. He took our bags with a cheerful demeanor, and was equally as pleasant whe he DELIVERED THEM to our room. Our room was small, but exquisite (and our understanding was that this room was to be remodeled shortly). Tile floors, King-size bed, woodwork cabinets for closets & TV, and an oversized shower. The BEST part? A hammock bordering the beach, no more than 15 feet from our door...perfect for dozing off together after an evening on Duvall/at the Tiki Bar. Boomer (event coordinator) was great. He gave us the low-down on local \"can't miss\" outings, and his snorkling school was incredibly fun - no need to go elsewhere for wildlife...just head to the pier and see many fish (bring a waterproof camera!).

The concierge can book tickets for this as well. 3. When booking other tours, look up Jason on Duvall St (runs a cruise/outing booking agency with cigar shop). He was incredibly helpful! 4. Take full advantage of the \"on-premises\" activities. Our snorkling on-site was comparable to what we saw in the Dry Tortugas (70 miles away...a 2+hour cruise!!!)

Getting there was easy, if slow enough, (the road works were out in full force, so it was 1 lane all the way - and up to Marathon the traffic was a total pain - but once we got past Marathon things got easier and faster and the bridges were great), and the hotel was so very easy to find. Check in was a breeze - they has all the keys and welcome packet waiting for us - so it literally took 2 mins, the staff were very friendly. We booked an Oceanfront room - and when they say Oceanfront - they really mean it - you could sit in bed and just see the Ocean - now thats my kind of view! Our room was a \"new\" room - and it was absolutely lovely - amazingly comfy bed, great plasma TV, fab air conditioning, lovely large bathroom, wet bar area with a mini fridge, coffee facilities and a blender! btw.....they are closing the original building shortly to renovate those rooms so that they are up to the standard of the new rooms. I spent a lot of time on our balcony - reading and looked out to see - if i could change one thing about this hotel it would be to have a little more privacy between balconies - but i guess they don't want to take away from the view at all. The pool was lovely (you also have the use of 2 other pools - but we never made it to those) - they had live music by the pool on Friday and Saturday, we actually spent most of our time on the pier - i loved sitting on there surrounded by the water and then you can go down the steps straight into the ocean - so very relaxing and quiet on the pier. We had breakfast at the restaurant on the beach - which was great and good value and then we had lunch at the pool bar - also great and decently priced. The walk down Duval was OK - it was very hot (well it is august) - so i admit to wimping out and getting a rickshaw (fun but v. expensive - $30!) and a cab another (only $7). We were there for lobsterfest - so on saturday night they close off the bottom blocks of Duval and there are lots of stalls and lobster grilling going on with live music - all the restaurants take place in it so its a great way to sample different lobster recipes. If we make it back down to Key West we would definitely stay at the Sothernmost on the beach again - yes its a little walk to Mallory Sqaure and the really busy end of Duval - but thats why i like it - its nowhere near as crowded at this end and the hotels seems a lot closer together down the other end.", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ridgewood, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cTruly an All Inclusive Stay\u201d", "Author": "DiamondPerez", "ReviewID": "UR73502739", "Content": "The hotel is kept clean, rooms are spacious, pool and sunning area were relaxing.

We have a heavenly bed (westin's brand) in our house. This bed was comparable and definitely better than the Marriott's. Super comfy!!! -The best part of the hotel is the 'beach' area tucked in the back. It's not an actual beach (although there is one right next door). This is more of an area they have filled with sand, which has palm trees, hammocks, beach chairs and a fabulous pier you can lay out on. While the pool is nice, it's more crowded and louder/active. This area is so relaxing and the view of the ocean is perfect! It definitely made the stay feel more tropical lounging here versus the pool. We came back to lay out here even after we had moved on to the Marriott. -The pool bar drinks and food are both nice -The decor of the updated rooms is attractive and enjoyable -Staff is super friendly/helpful -It has a very quaint feel to it, unlike larger hotels. It is not as fancy or commanding, but there is something really nice about that while staying in Key West I usually go for swanky and bigger is usually better for me.

TIP: The balconies connect so it is best to be sure to keep your balcony door locked or your neighbor can walk right in. This hotel is in a perfect location - right across the street from the hop on/hop off trolley. They also have a conceirge at this hotel and she booked all of our activities for us. The restaurant is right on the beach and there are a couple of bars on the property and a swimming pool. The lobster benedict for breakfast is lovely. The bathroom is huge. And if you like a 'green' hotel - this one is for you. They are very trendy towards going green. The beds are wonderful. Limited cable channels (about 50) but who cares, right? You really are in the room just to sleep. There is a spa which is great also. There is something for everyone at this hotel. Just make sure you stay at 'Southern Most Hotel on the beach'. There is one with a similar name across the street which is not on the beach - Owned by the same owner. My husband loved this hotel and its location so much that we are going back this winter! Can't wait! Dexter at the front desk was so very helpful, as were all of the employees. A few tips: 1. if you go on any of the fishing boats, take dramamine first. The waves were bouncy and half of the people on board our boat were sea sick and throwing up the whole time, including me. Everyone who wanted to fish though, all caught fish. 2. we got ripped off at a t-shirt shop. Here is a tip - shop on upper Duval, not lower Duval where all of the cruise ships come in. The prices vary dramatically! Also at alot of the shops, nothing is marked - and they tell you one price and ring up another price, so shop at stores that have prices marked on the goods. 3. You can walk from one end of Duval St. to the other, so if you fly into Key West, there is no need to rent a car. There are bicycles and scooters for rent all over the island if you don't feel like walking, plus the trolley. However, I am in my 50's and kind of out of shape and I walked all over and never got tired. We were in a rental car from Miami and parked the car and never drove it again until we left. 4. For souvenirs at honest prices, I like 430 Duval St. (can't remember the name but the address is on my receipt) - Its a nice little gift shop with all kinds of things for under $10.

If you do, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no rest-rooms, no cold drinks available and if you want to use the pool, you have a small hike through the parking lot to the pool. The Beach Caf\u00c3\u00a9 has been nicely redone but, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the same size and has the same number of staff. We wanted to have lunch at the caf\u00c3\u00a9 but we were told there would be at least \u00c2\u00bd hour wait. Fine, now what are we suppose to do, wait there in the heat for \u00c2\u00bd hour or more? Or, should we go back to our chaise lounge and return every 10 minutes to check. A way of announcing when your table is ready via a PA system such as TGIF has would really be helpful. If they increase the number of guests that the resort can accommodate, they should also consider increasing the size of the beach caf\u00c3\u00a9. We feel that the Southernmost Hotel on the Beach has lost some of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s charm. Bigger doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t always mean better. Will we stay at your resort again?

The beds were fine, and the sheets were clean. The bathroom was clean and we had a large real shower (not the bathtub and shower combo). The only complaints we had were that the beach restaurant was extremely slow - and we had one really bad experience. We all ordered breakfast and one of our friends ordered the quiche special, well the waitress brought out all of our food except hers and said that they had changed the quiche so did she want it or something else but our friend couldn't eat the ingredients in the new one so she ordered something else - so all of us except her had our food and at the end of the meal they still charged her - they even had to fix the bill because it had too much on it. I just felt like they should have done something since they made the mistake and should not have brought out the rest of our food if her meal was not ready. The food was fine but I would recommend going somewhere else. We also just had a little issue that the concierge told us we were getting one deal at one of our activities but it turned out that was not the case and we didn't find out until too late so we kind of felt tricked.

While my wife and were getting massages people walk right by you and she had to change practically in a garage near beach, not what we expected.

Rooms: Great rooms at Southernmost on the Beach as long as you are away from the pool. Rooms near the pool are noisy until 11pm every night with music and guests who swim and party. Air conditioning units are incredibly noisy and disrupt sleep. The units turn on and off constantly throughout the day/night. Restaurant: Go somewhere else. EVERY day the kitchen got our breakfast (simple meals) wrong. Undercooked food, undercooked food, dry as sand pancakes, etc. Bar at Restaurant: Needs a renovation and the barmaids are cocky and rude. The comments heard passed to patrons by this group of washed up bartenders were inappropriate and unprofessional. And 2 out of the 5 can't make a decent drink. Skip this bar except perhaps during happy hour. Housekeeping: Somedays so-so. Didn't change sheets when requested. Never replaced water bottles. Clean hand towels were a gift. And, dusting must not be part of the routine. Be care, Housekeepers leave main key for all guest rooms loose on their carts and they leave their carts unsupervised for long stretches of time in the hallway. Housekeeping supervisor needs a personality. Pool Bar: Rich is nice guy. Drinks are outrageously priced and management obviously doesn't care. Mixed drinks $10!

There are no rafts or floats, but they do have many noodles to float around on or with. At night the pool is lit up with colored lights. A night swim is a nice way to end your day. The staff are accomodating and helpful. The concierge desk has many discounts and/or coupons for restaurants, excursions or drinks. Ask for a dinner suggestion and they are right on. They will call you a cab if necessary. With the high degree of humidity in Sept this was the way to go. The food at the on-site restaurant is a little expensive, but all of KW is. The pool bar offers a wide variety of drinks (offering a drink menu). I suggest trying the Zen. It's light and refreshing on a hot, humid day. Music is played during the daytime and piped through speakers located around the pool deck. Iced water is available all day without charge. And the water is good to drink.

Paradise! We were lucky enough to have a room on the pool and beach side, however we were in low season so if booking in high season and looking to save money go for the Southernmost hotel as you have the same pool and beach rights as their sister properties. The best thing is you can swim in the pool up to 2300 hours. However, when we booked in the receptionist told us that there was a wedding at the restaurant so we could not use that however what they failed to tell us was that they'd obviously given the wedding party permission to swim fully clothed until 0100 in the morning. Because the night receptionist would obviously have dealt with this. Kevin the barman is welcoming and a good source of trips and has a goodlocal knowledge of things to do. We had breakfast one morning at the hotel restaurant.....don't. The service is poor, expensive and all they want to do is to place you in the sun so the eggs aren't the only thing to be fried! Go to Camille's in nearby Simonton Street if high season or a weekend book in advance. For eat's use the Hog's Breath Tavern, Sloppy Joe's or Guy Harvey's which are all at the Mallory Square end. To see the sunset then book into Fury cruises sunset snorkel and cruise, they have various stands along Duval Street including one right at the Mallory Square end. You get to snorkel North America's only natural reef and on the way back the Beer and Rum Punch never ends! The crew are also extremly friendly and welcoming. You also get to see the sunset without the crowds! My top tip is leave the car at the hotel, you could rent one of the electric buggy's but you have to pay for parking so instead rent a moped for your time there, its a fantastic way to get around Key West day or night and reasonably safe as long as you don't ride around like Easy Rider! Also they are free to park. We rented from a place called sunshine rentals but shop around and use the avaiable coupon books most of the companies will deliver and I think the ones out of the old town are a lot cheaper.

The room had a king size bed, flat screen tv on the wall, new tile throughout the large bathroom & super size shower area. The bed was sooo comfortable & so were the pillows. I am very picky about cleanliness & this hotel gave me zero fears. Towels, soap, shampoo everything was well picked & not cheaply chosen. The internet connection worked fine & parking was free. Elevator access was perfect. The balcony had patio furniture (2 chairs with a small table). I sat out here drinking coffee in the a.m. or relaxed in the evening just to breathe the air. There was plenty of dresser space for a full week of clothes for 2 of us. The room had its own hair dryer, iron & ironing board, security safe & small mini fridge for drinks. It also came with a small coffee pot with all of the condiments (coffee, cream, sugar (variety). There is a laundry area on the property near the office if you need to wash clothes. Everyday waking up here was lovely just gazing at the clean beautiful room. The groundskeepers were always busy cleaning & tidying. The small quaint beach area had chairs & umbrellas & small tables (no fees-all free). I asked for extra towels I got them, I asked for coffee - I got it. The location was the best & by looking at the neighboring hotels I am soooo pleased & happy about my choice. I got every pennys worth-NO DOUBT. It felt good knowing that my $ was spent worthwhile. We rented a car (it was cheaper to add it to my vacation package than to not). Im glad we did, it allowed us to get around & venture around the island more at any hour. Although we did not eat at the hotel - I did once want to order a late night snack from the restaurant but they didnt deliver. As others have said the hotel is far enough from all of the busy busy Duval street partying- so you are still at peace & safe.

I needed to print a coupon from the web & the desk clerk let me email it to them & they printed it for me! How\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that for service!!! If I ever go back to Key West I will stay here. We visited the turtle hospital in Marathon about 1 hr. away, the Dolphin Research Center in Marathon all in one day. We took 2 Catamaran Sunset cruises (Sunny Days is the best max 6 people awesome captain), snorkeled, parasailed, rode waverunners-around the island, & danced at the Garden of Eden just for fun.

Modern lighting fixtures, crown modlings, and beautiful, quality furnishings appoint the room. The bathroom has granite countertops and high quality Kohler plumbing fixtures. There's a walk in fully tiled shower with a bench. The toilet is also in a separate room and is powerful enough to suck down a grapefruit I swear :) King size bed with great linens, and there is a granite wet bar with blender, cofee maker, sink, mini fridge, and safe. A great set up and an easy way to save some money on drinks by bringing your own beer/mixers. Our room had a huge wall mounted 42 inch plasma tv - not that you're going to want to watch it with the view out your wrap around windows with roman shades. French doors open out to a wrap around balacony with 2 chairs, 2 small side tables, and 2 full chase lounge chairs. The view spectacular out into the atlantic. Check in went smoothly and there was plenty of free parking in the fully lit parking lot. Pool is nice but full of kids - if you're looking for something just head over to \"south beach\" and have Juan set you up with a chair/umbrella. The beach is free for hotel guests, but make sure to take care of juan - he works hard! The beach is small, but the sand is nice. There is a fair amount of sea weed/grass washed up on shore and in the water, but just hop over it and once you get 10 feet or so out into the water it's not rocky at all and the sand is quite nice. You can walk out quite a ways and get a nice view of the southernmost point in the U.S. Very cool. Restaurant/cafe is great, but of course you'll want to eat your way around downtown and spread the love a little bit! Overall, you can't go wrong with Southernmost on the beach - at least the new rooms, so make sure to ask for one.

Something to be said for relaxing on your private balcony overlooking water that seems painted from a palette of heavenly blues and greens. Rooms themselves are magnificent, nicely appointed and comfortable. Staff could not be friendlier or more helpful with any/every request.

You're a two-minute walk from the Southernmost Point in the U.S., and an easy stroll to Duval St., with its myriad bars and restaurants and unmatched people-watching opportunities.

The location and amenenities makes this hotel ideal, but its people and their level of service really make it something special. Just a great trip.

My wife and I met in Miami and visited the Keys many times. We decided to take our teenage kids back to show them where we met. We wanted to be near the activities of Duvall Street, but still have some privacy. The Southernmost on the Beach Hotel met our needs. I agree with the other reviews, that the hotel was clean, the pool was great and the location was within walking distance of everything. Our reason for posting the review was the misleading advertising of an ocean view room and the way we were treated when we questioned it. We booked an Ocean View room for $329 a night on the hotel website. When we arrived we were given room 524 which was at the farthest end of building B from the ocean. To see the ocean you had to go out on the balcony, look 90 degrees to the right and you could see a 10 yard wide view of the ocean about 300 yards away. We could not believe this was the ocean view so we went to the front desk and were told that was it and that only a few King bed rooms faced the ocean. The next day we went up on the balconies of building C to find that they all had a panoramic view of the ocean. We went on the web site and found that they advertise both an ocean view and a partial ocean view room. We went back to the desk with a different person to relate our findings and again were told that our partial view from the balcony was the ocean view. It is obvious when you see building C that our view was not ocean view and the fee we paid for this ridiculous view was also much higher than the fee listed for a partial ocean view. We gave up a room at our time share with the HIlton, to pay for this partial view. Our reason for posting this review is to caution everyone about the definition of ocean view. We would suggest that you specifically ask how much of a view you will have and from where if the view is important to you and you are paying for the view. Outside of this disappointment and the rude way we were handled, the hotel lives up to its billing.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Weekend\u201d", "Author": "jazzergirl", "ReviewID": "UR32617099", "Content": "We recently spent a relaxing weekend at Southernmost.

No privacy whatsoever on balcony. Bathroom was very large with a large shower. The grounds were nicely manicured. Hammocks are a nice touch if you can get one. Pool nice and clean. Parking is free and easy. Staff was the worst part. Understaffed at check in. Had to wait 10+ min to check in. Not overly friendly - just rushed. Night staff at front desk was downright rude. The night guy def. hates his job. I am convinced. Bartender at the pool was very slow. Too long of a wait for a drink when it was not busy. We rented a electric car and asked staff where to park. We parked where they told us and the car was moved over night to the street and we got a ticket! Not right. FYI: This hotel is NOT walking distance to everything. Unless of course you are in full hiking/walking gear. If you are dressed for dinner or a night out on the town you won't be able to walk. It is just too far and would be too uncomfortable in heels/dress shoes. Ocean Key or Pier House are much better choices for location to bars/restaurants/Mallory Sq. Also: NO sunset view. You have to go all the way down Duval to catch sunset - again, NOT walking distance. Unless you like LONG, LONG walks in the heat. So: if the price is right - stay. We paid $300+ a night.

There were plenty of places in the grounds, or on the beach to sit in hammocks and sun loungers, but our favourite spot was on the jetty.

Other great places to eat were The Bistro (on Duval St on the left, past Truman and Olivia) and Cafe Marquesa (Fleming and Simontown).

I stayed in one of the pretty new rooms with an ocean view and a small balcony that I could enjoy the sunrise from. The rooms are really spectacular and beautifully appointed with dark mahogany furniture, crisp white linens, a duvet, modern lamps, and a flat screen TV.

The old parking lot has been replaced with grass, palm trees, chaise lounges, and hammocks, and offers another area besides the pool to relax, sun, read or just hang out. The pool area has a hip new bar that we took advantage of. The private pier is still there and is still great to relax on. Also, the whole oceanfront area by the pier is sandy now and offers another area where you can chill out. We left the property a couple of time to wander down Duval, but other than that, we just hung out and read by the pool or on the beach. You really never have to leave, unless you want to. The Caf\u00c3\u00a9 makes great food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll even bring it to you at the pool.

This year, I decided we definitely wanted to stay here, and have had a FABULOUS time, so I wanted to make sure to write a good review. I have stayed in five places in Key West, and this one is, by far, my favorite. We had an oceanfront room that had a gorgeous view of the gulf. It was one of the new rooms that just opened in Dec. 2008. Comfy bed and pillows. Mini-fridge and coffee maker in the room. Easy to use thermostat for air conditioner. The bathroom was wonderful-large with good shampoo/soap etc. Shower was large with a bench. Wrap-around windows and balcony with chairs and a lounger right on the ocean. The decor was subtle-navy blue, white and khaki. Beachy without being tacky. The USA Today was delivered to our door every morning. We ate breakfast and lunch at the restaurant. The food was good and reasonably priced. The bar tenders were very nice and the drinks were affordable. (The drinks are less expensive at the restaurant bar than the pool bars.) I swam in the heated pool at the Southernmost Hotel, which is part of the property. While the one at Southernmost on the beach has a great view. it was not heated, and it was a bit chilly while we were here. Complimentary beach towels make it easy to swim in the ocean or the pool several times a day. What I like best about the hotel (besides its oceanfront location) is the fact that it is right on Duval, but at the quiet end. It noticeably got quieter as we walked back from the Mallory Square area last night. I am not a late night person, so I appreciated the calm and quiet With the new addition, they put in lots of pretty landscaping. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone! Things to do nearby: Butterfly Conservatory, Southernmost Point, Bike and Scooter Rentals, Duval Street with shopping, several restaurants. At hotel: three pools, two pool bars, one restaurant/bar, a semi-private beach with free chairs and towels for hotel guests, gift shop, private sunning pier, probably more things that I did not try!

The new rooms are fantastic, spacious, clean, comfortable, hardwood floors, classy furnishings, wireless internet, huge bathroom. We got one of the rooms directly on the end of the building overlooking the water, with unobstructed views; it was like being on a cruise ship with a balcony, only with a lot more space. One drawback is that the adjacent resort has a service loading area at the end of that street, so you cannot open the wrap around windows on that street side, unless you want that ugly view; we had a corner room with wrap around deck. Additionally, there was landscaping construction going on below during the daytime; Bobcat and lots of digging. The new buildings and rooms were completed and furnished, all that remained was the landscaping, so in a few months (by February?) it should be serene. Parking is included on the ground floor of the new buildings, the new building had no ground floor rooms; this was very convenient, since we could drive anywhere we wanted on the Key. We were told we were the first guests to stay in that room. Dexter at the front desk is awesome! Unheated pool felt cold, heated pool was cool, hot tub was boiling. We ate twice at Alonzo's, once at B.O.'s fish wagon, once at the NY Pasta Garden. All were good, but B.O.'s took 30-40 minutes just for oyster po' boys and conch fritters. NY Pasta Garden is a good deal. Alonzo's was tasty, crowded during happy hour. Loaded up on Key Lime pie and lime products at Kermit's. We strolled Duval Street and did touristy stuff during the day. Did not stop at Bahia Honda this time. It was a nice relaxing trip. Our room with the balcony view was so great, we spent lots of time in there. Definitely one of the nicest hotels on Key West, if not the nicest, as most do not have direct water access nor a beach.

It was our 3rd trip to Key West but our first time staying at the SHOD. Overall, we had a lovely experience. Our favorite bars and restaurants are on the Mallory Square side of Duval, so we found ourselves hiking the mile or so Duval walk several times a day. We stayed in one of the cheaper rooms overlooking the parking lot. However, our room was quiet, and although a bit outdated, very clean. We had no issues except for one morning when our AC unit was rattling. We called the front desk and maintenance immediately came up to fix the problem. Also, our luggage didn't make it to Key West on the same plane, unfortunately! The airline delivered our suitcases to the hotel, and the staff immediately brought them to our room. The pool area was wonderful, with many chairs in the sun and also shaded. The pool bar had some easy snacks such a hot dogs and chips/salsa. Several days we walked over to the Southernmost Beach Cafe for a bigger lunch. If you're looking for a good pool and tiki bar for a better price than the Westin or Hyatt or Ocean Key, this is a great location. Some restaurant / bar recommendations: 1) Alonzo's Oyster Bar (at A&B Lobster) on the marina - we ate here 3 times! The food is fantastic (especially if you like oysters) and atmosphere lively. 2) Conch Republic Seafood on the marina - we always stop here for a drink. Great views of the water. 3) Roof Top Cafe - we had our Christmas night dinner here. Fancy but not stuffy, eat outside on the deck. Great for a special occasion. 4) Sloppy Joe's - a must to hear some good live music Activity recommendations: 1) Butterfly Conservatory: this is right across Duval from the hotel. What a pleasant surprise! Exotic butterflies in a lovely greenhouse. 2) Day trip: We rented a car at Tropical Rent-A-Car (across street from hotel) and went up Rte 1 to about Mile Marker 40. At MM 29, we went to the Key Deer Refuge on Big Pine Key. This is free (please leave a donation). We didn't see any key deer (which are nocturnal), but we did spend time at the fresh water pond (called Blue Hole) and saw an alligator. We then drove up to MM 39 to Bahia Honda State Park. Lovely little beach and walking trails where we saw several iguana. 3) Sunset Cruise: Take the Fury catamaran sunset cruise. We are partial to Fury since we were married on a Fury sunset cruise in December 2007. Laid back and the crew keeps your cup filled with beer.

The next day, Friday, we were a little concerned about the preparations going into a reggae concert to be held on the property and were a bit bothered by the fact that the parking spots in front of our room had several larger trucks (concert-related) and really made sitting on the porch to enjoy the view and some R&R impossilbe. But, we were most impressed by the hotel's willingness to move our room and offered to do so w/out a fuss or w/o guilt trips, etc. I can honestly say, if we'd had to \"battle\" for a different room, it likely would have jaded our trip. The hotel did everything it could to ensure our visit was a good one and they efficiently and effectively handled a large concert crowd. We had no idea the magnitude of the concert when we rec'd the \"heads up\" phone call at home prior to our arrival and it wasn't until we arrived and saw just how big of a deal it was that we better understood all it entailed.

Same people from the hotel that had kids did not buy the tickets (which I understand since it was $25 per person) the problem is that they CLOSE down the beach from 2 pm on Saturday (when the concert was going to be at 7 pm) and they did not allow people to go to the ocean.

The beach is small and cute, but the water is totally unswimmable and even too brown/murky/seaweedy for wading to cool off. we didnt even use the beach here because it was too hot to not have somewhere to cool off. this is not a true beach, just a sandy spot. So overall, the hotel was so-so. The pool was out of order which we did not really care about anyway because it was small and unattractive. Go to the Southernmost hotel pool with the tiki bar. MUCH nicer! We were lucky to meet a honeymooming couple and stay at their 2-bedroom luxury suite for our last night, at no cost. These are 1.5 million$ suites that they rent out for less than $250 a night and are 2 bedroom, so VERY affordable if you have 4 people. They were AWESOME, subzero appliances in the kitchen, 3 bathrooms, granite counters, kohler applicances, glass walls, an tropical poool set up. So this blew the Southernmost out of the water. It was called Santa Maria suites and ill write a review there too. Anyway, the Southernmost is at the quiet end.

Why she sent a housekeeper exactly in the single half an hour that we were in despite that she knew that we are leaving in minutes (we had been out for the rest of the time from 9:00 am - 5:30 pm) and then she accused us rudely of refusing service I can have only one guess: they are serious staff problems at the Southernmost and therefore the service is substandard at best.. An iritating factor is the \"sweet\" barrage of correspondence that the management showers on the prospective and past visitor. They requested a post-stay evaluation, but as this turned out to be negative they left it without any answer.

We would definitely stay here again for the beach access. We are lazy people so we like to roll out of bed and onto the beach. This was our first trip without the baby, so we chose Key West because we were looking for a place without lots of babies/kids. There were a few, but for the most part Key West is for the adults. Our room was a 2nd floor balcony, but it overlooked the parking, so we didn't hang out there. We had heard about the ongoing construction, but we did not hear any noise at all. No trucks, no banging, nothing. We saw the workers, so they weren't off or anything. The rooms face the other side anyways, so even if they were banging around I'm not sure we would have been bothered. The property is in a really nice quiet location and an easy walk to Duval Street. Our room was nice, but we weren't in it hardly at all. The 2 houses across the way (La Mer and Dewey) looked really nice though, but not worth the extra cost to us (maybe if it was a special occasion). We only stayed out by the pool our last day, so we wouldn't be all sandy for our return home. It was nice, but nothing could beat the beach. There were only 2 umbrellas available for rent, but we were able to get one easily. Maybe because it was $10. We think they are nice especially if you plan to lay out all day. You can leave for lunch and come back, so you do have your chairs/umbrella for the whole day. We didn't care for the food at the beach cafe. Across the street is a little cuban cafe and we got our cuban coffees there for the beach. Banana Cafe was fantastic for breakfast. Of the 3 nights we were there, we ended up eating dinner twice at 915 because it was so delicious (the whole fish was perfect, also yummy was the chicken wrap, devils on horseback, and chipotle conch chowder). For our third dinner, we were very pleased with dinner at Alice's. I had a skirt steak that I'm absolutely craving right now. I don't remember where we ate ours, but stone crab claws are must. Mangoes was a nice place to sit for lunch, but we were very disappointed with the way oversalted food. The mushroom appetizer was just gross.

We originally requested a room towards the end - closest to the beach, but upon arriving we did not get this. We did not mind at all since we still had a top floor room and most of the rooms have a beach/ocean view anyway. We ended up being very happy with our room because we still had a partial view of the beach/ocean and we were very close to the entrance part of the pool and beach, plus we were very close to everything else by the street. We also had a private balcony, unlike the rest of the rooms towards the end of the property and all the rooms on the first floor. Their balconies were just walk way upon entering their rooms like any regular motel. Plus we noticed at night that the end part of the hotel is very quite and very dark - not too many lights. Kind of creepy. It was very quiet where we were at too but we were happy to have a few lights lit. The girl at the front desk was very nice and helpful. She gave us tips on reasonably priced places to eat for breakfast. The beach club across the hotel on our private beach was nice. A little high in price but expected. They had yummy hot wings and ice cold beer. Plus hamburger and food for the kids. They also served breakfast in the morning, though we did not try it. The beach was nice but had lots of rocks in the water which made it hard to walk your first few steps into the water, once passed that - it was fine. Be sure to wear water shoes. My brother had his and did not hurt his feet at all. We spent most of our time in the pool which was big and never full. Be sure to visit the Southernmost Point - walking distance from hotel. There is an ice cream shop and a little Cuban place to eat with outdoor seating across the street of the hotel. We only had breakfast there but it was very convenient. The trolley stop is also across the street - perfect if you reserve a tour. This is highly recommended. It takes you all over the island with hop on and off privileges all day. The tour guy is very interesting and you learn and see a lot. Mallory Square is a must. Also a Glassbottom Boat Ride is fun too - do this at sunset!

The room was virtually spotless, everything matched. It was a good size, comfortable beds. The property around the hotel was beautiful, decorated with palm trees and hibiscus flowers. The pool area was also very clean. There were blow up rafts laying around the pool, and my mom and i spent most of our days on rafts in the pool. The tanning pier was also nice, but most of the time, it was so hot and the pool served as a better option =] The hotel is located on the quiet end of Duval Street. It was very relaxing and quiet. I dont think i would ever stay in a different hotel in Key West. Overall, our Key West vacation was wonderful, and our stay at the Southernmost Hotel on the Beach made it even better.

The small beach has a bar and restaurant, there an option of 3 great pools, and a pier to lay out on. The staff was very friendly and the place was very well kept. My favorite thing about it was the location. We were on the Atlantic side so we had the beach and it was quiet, but we were located right on the end of Duval Street so we could walk to all the restaurants and bars. There were little convience stores and restaurants so you could grab a quick sandwhich or snack across the street. The beach was small, but the perfect size for me. Just enough beach to lay out without it being too crowded, but good for the wading in the ocean occasionally. It would be really great for small children because it would be very easy to keep an eye on them. I would recommend this hotel to everyone - young, old, couples, and families.

The staff are indeed very pleasant, helpful and even friendly. The rooms are nicely decorated and clean with good facilities. The beach is indeed right there and provided you have a top floor ocean view (at the end of the building away from South Street) then it has a special feel to it. It is this that you pay for as the hotel in my opinion when compared like for like with other 300 dollar/night establishments falls short. The rooms do no have balconies which is a shame given the view. There is an outside corridor which you can share with your neighbours unless you have one of the few rooms we saw with private balconies (I guess they must be 400 bucks a night). The layout is that of an overnight two storey motel although clearly a better standard. Breakfast is not included but is available across at the bar/ restaurant on the beach, which whether evening or morning is extremely pleasant although slightly shabby which adds to its appeal in a way. The pool area is nice and the pool itself a good size. You also get use of the sister hotels facilities although that is across the street so not the best in your bikini (hers not mine!). We arrived a day early and the front desk accommodated us although we did have to move rooms after the first night which they organised for us, bags and everything which was nice. On the point of staff however we did observe one employee enjoy a drink and leave his cup on the stairwell just in time to avoid tripping over it. He then proceeded to just walk off which we thought a little odd. The room itself also lacked the attention to detail of better hotels such as the shower cubicle base being cheap plastic and the curtains being behind a table making them difficult to close. Perhaps the most annoying was the adjacent nightclub which backs onto the property at the 'ocean-end' where the alleged more expensive rooms are located. If you don't mind your room beating with the base of an evening then fine, this is Key West afterall. It did go off regularly at about 11.30pm but it was annoying if you were in the room relaxing. Don't get me wrong, very nice hotel which was a fine end to our vacation but either the details need to be sharpened up on or they need to review their prices (IMHO).", "Date": "May 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "ipswich", "Title": "\u201cwonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "jacey123", "ReviewID": "UR7704162", "Content": "I am the type of person who researches extensively my travel destinations.

Southernmost on the Beach is part of the Southernmost Hotels and Resorts, which are comprised of five properties. Four of them Southermost on the Beach, Southernmost Hotel, Dewey House and LeMar Hotel are right next to each other. As a guest of any of these locations you are allowed to use the facilities (pools, tiki bar, etc) that each offer. Right next to Southernmost on the is a public beach, not very big but it is right there., where you can rent chairs and there's a small resturant too.

The hotel is located at the southermost end and is about a 1.3 mile walk to Mallory Square where the sunset celebrations are held. But the walk down Duval Street keeps you occupied with all the stores/resturants/bars. The hotel offers parking spaces either at Southernmost on the Beach or across the street. You really do not need a car in this area, there is no place to park on Duval or other streets and if you find one it's .25 cents per 10 minutes. I rented a car for two days only to visit the upper keys, the other days, I rented a scooter. Use the Visitors Center at the hotel to rent one, they are less expensive then other rental places. See David at the Vistors Center, he's great and will also book trips for you. The people at the hotel were friendly and helpful. Overall, the place was nice and quiet (no one allowed under 25 years of age, unless accompanied by parent/adult). I loved this policy, especially at spring break time. The only issues I had were that a new bathmat was not provided everyday ,the ice bucket was never emptied and they did not put the ironing board back in the closet. So, I used a towel, emptied the bucket myself and put back the board. That's the worst of it.
