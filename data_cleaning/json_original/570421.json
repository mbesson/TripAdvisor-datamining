We did a lot of research into the area and I must admit, Via Nazionale is a fantastic location and is exactly where you want to be staying if you want to go site seeing in Rome. The \"Hotel\" however is anything but a hotel! We arrived there late on the Wednesday night (10.30pm), the front of the \"hotel\" had a huge double door which was locked, we buzzed for about half an hour and finally another resident was going in and let us in also. This accommodation was the most bizarre set up, it is like the owners have rented part of a floor of this building and they are letting out rooms on it. It has a small poky desk stuck in the corner which they call a reception. Besides the guest's there is only someone on site in the morning. Rooms are very basic and the breakfast is a poor excuse, we had to go to a pub 2 doors up from where we were staying, we got a coffee and a croissant and that was what they called breakfast, you didn't have a choice of having any extra or anything else. This hotel was definitely not a hotel, I wouldn't even class it a B&B, very strange set up, there are also about another 4 \"Hotels\" in the same building. There is definitely a lot better accommodation available in this area. Very disappointed as we booked this based soley on previous reviews.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Belgrade", "Title": "\u201cgood location\u201d", "Author": "AngelinaNina", "ReviewID": "UR107081606", "Content": "Good location, clean rooms, very high security level Stuff doesn't speak English , breakfast is poor and same every day", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "\u00c5rhus", "Title": "\u201cstay away\u201d", "Author": "fally99", "ReviewID": "UR58830340", "Content": "When I paied for our stay - I was charges tripple payment.by a mistake The hotel has admitted the failure - but I can't get my money back - they still owe me 1085\u20ac (17/3 2010)", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois,USA", "Title": "\u201cHidden Treasure of Rome\u201d", "Author": "SeniorCruisers", "ReviewID": "UR46499201", "Content": "This is a very good value based on it's amenities.

Fortunately I read reviews on trip advisor before travelling to Rome and realised that the hotel may be difficult to find as there is only a sign on the pillar outside the door, so we found the building easily. There are only a few rooms situated on the second floor of a large old building. It is literally a few minutes walk from the main train and coach station, - ten minutes walk to trevi, spanish steps, Plaza Venizia, Forum etc Walking distance of everything. The hotel staff were really friendly and provided us with a map and explained how to reach every attraction either by foot or which bus to catch. My daughter is very messy but her room was cleaned, all her clothes picked up, folded very neatly and put in the wardrobe! Breakfast was basic - a pastry, packet toast , tea or coffee and orange juice but there is a Spar a couple of doors away for snacks and a McDonalds two door up which does great coffee. For a bargain break in Rome Magnifico Hotel offers great value for money.", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cIt depends on what you are looking for.\u201d", "Author": "maggie30", "ReviewID": "UR6317259", "Content": "I stayed in a twin room the room was a bit small, but hey I was just there to sleep and take a shower. It was spotless! I had a small fridge in my room so it was great to get some things from a supermarket a few blocks away and stick it in there for when I was thirsty. The room is modern and you can tell it has just been redecorated. Bad part of it: 1. the people at the reception spend most of there time on the phone. (with personal calls) When you need something you have to \"interrupt them\". At night the guy hides in a room and just talks and talks and talks. if your room is close to the resception desk be prepared to hear phone ring all night long. Either it be the hotels phone, cell phone, or the door bell. 2. They have a computer that you can use (its also the hotels computer) When I was on it at night because I couldnt sleep the guy at reception asked me if I would take long because he needed to use it.. I gave it to him right away, and when I turned back to see what he was doing he was chatting. I thought it was rude to take a guest off the computer so he could chat . 3. Breakfast was not the best. It kind of seemed you just had to eat whatever they put on your table. Which was prepacked toast, microwaved heated milk and something kind of crossant. 4. THIS REALLY MADE ME MAD!! The cleaning lady decided to move arround our stuff in the room because it was in her way! When we got to our room our suitcases weren't were we left them. She put them under our beds. She took my moms traveling bag and decided that the closet was a better place to put it. It took me a while to find my slippers.", "Date": "December 2, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Central Europe", "Title": "\u201cExpensive for what you get\u201d", "Author": "GK1970", "ReviewID": "UR6307887", "Content": "We spent 7 nights here on our honeymoon in October 2005. Positives: Location is OK. 20 mins walking distance to Trevi fountain. But also 5 mins to metro. On Via Nazionale, so quite busy but interesting with shops and restaurants Negatives: - One of the smallest hotels Ive ever been in. For 120 Euro a room , Im sure there are better out there. Were given a double room where you basically couldnt get out sideways from the bed, the room was so small. So depressing as we had been planning this for more than half a year - it was our honeymoon. The pictures on the internet suggest a palace - it is in an old palace, but the hotel occupies half a floor - in total probably was occupied by just one person before it became a hotel. Website and internet is misleading - suggests a grand hotel facade and lots of space. - I had specifically asked for the best room they could give us when booking. We were moved to their best room only after 3 nights! - Breakfast is really very very poor. Great coffee, but thats it. I lived in Italy for a while some years ago so I know what Italian breakfasts are like. What we got was the absolute minimum to qualify even as an Italian breakfast. Vaccum packed \"toast\" slices, and jam!! We ended up going to the local Spar to top up which wasted precious 45 minutes of our day every day. - Slackers at the reception. I don't use that in a derogatory way, but just to emphasise that these were not trained hotel staff, just part time workers or students earning a little money to \"babysit\" the place, clean up, and let you in at night. All in all, clean enough and good location. But if you are coming to rome for a special occasion, don't even think about Magnifico.", "Date": "November 30, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai", "Title": "\u201cFriendly and a great location\u201d", "Author": "hotmel", "ReviewID": "UR5925214", "Content": "The hotel was conveniently located on Via Nazionale, a short walk from Termini. It occupied the second floor of a building that was accessed via the forecourt of another building on the Via Nazionale. The reception was linked by intercom system to the main gate which is always closed so it was a little difficult to locate the first time. We stayed in room 202 which was a clean, modern and comprised of twin beds, TV, mini bar, adequate air conditioning and an extra side room with a double bed that we never used. This room is ideal for small families. The hotel staff was very warm & friendly (Claudio was very helpful and went out of his way to assist). Bathroom was clean and supplies were replenished daily.We paid 80 euros per night. Breakfast consisted of toast, butter, jam, nutella, croissant, hot coffee and orange juice which was served in a small dining area. A convenience store named Despar was a few steps away and good to pick up water, beer, wine & snacks to stock up your minibar. Mcdonalds was located close by to grab a small bite. Great location close to Republica metro station and 15 minute walk to Trevi fountain ,Piazza Venezia and other attractions.
