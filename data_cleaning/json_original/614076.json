This hotel easily accommodated our party of three and made us feel at home. The owner is a charming older man who met us at breakfast with travel maps and willingly answered questions for us for a good twenty minutes. He showed us where to go, how to get there, was very friendly and helpful. He greeted each hotel guest at breakfast and made sure everyone had a good plan in place for the day. The room slept three easily, and was rather large. The bathroom was in good condition as well. The building itself is a little older and somewhat eerie, hence my four star rating. However, this would not deter me from returning and in my opinion, adds to the charm of the eastern european travel experience. The free breakfast was a nice selection, and the location of the hotel was very convenient for public transportation. The hotel is very secluded from the busy street and we heard no noise all night.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location - Friendly Staff\u201d", "Author": "elansyd", "ReviewID": "UR70564370", "Content": "I was very happy with my stay here.

Pros: Friendly manager, a \"mom and pop\" business. Clean hotel and rooms. Great location. Quiet. Cons: For this price I expected much more. The breakfast is dull, you get some bread, butter, spreadable cheese, three slices of cheese, three slices of salami and an assortment of jams, as well as some orange juice, coffee and tea. The hotel needs a major renovation, while it was clean, it was rather old, the furniture looked like it had seen better days, the carpets were faded and wrinkled with age, the walls were yellow and many were covered in ancient wallpaper. The rooms have no safes, so not really appropriate for business travellers who might be carrying laptops. The only wifi available was from tmobile, which was rather expensive too. The bed sheets had holes in them, which is not something a hotel guest ever wants to see. The cleaning ladies spontaneously decided to remove my hygiene products, which was very annoying. The light in the bathroom had to be smacked to turn on, and the water pipes made loud noises when used. I would only recommend this hotel to solo travellers who expect a cheap, no frills place to stay. I don't want to ruin the hotels business because the manager was friendly and helpful, but it's 2009 and at that price and in such a city, you really should offer more.", "Date": "October 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cTerrible disappointment\u201d", "Author": "jesper2412", "ReviewID": "UR47541280", "Content": "I am not a negative person, but for 82,- EUR a Night for a Double with Breakfast in the low Season, you could expect more - to say the least !

In Pension Charlottenburg the Receptionist was friendly enough, but constantly smoking to the extent that the Hotel Rooms were also affected. The whole Place is worn and torn and carpets are stained. Rooms are VERY basic and Beds very hard. I suppose if I was still a Student with no Children, I may have coped - maybe only so and then for a very reduced Price.

Located in a very chic neighborhood, you not only have many restaurants and shops located around you -it also has a feeling of a cool neighborhood and not a sterile setting. It is also a quiet. Located so close to the Kantstrasse where you will find many asian (vietnamese, sushi, thai-chinese) and ethnic restaurants. Forget about the main Ku'damm strasse -its too boring. When we arrived my 6 year old daughter had thrown up in the car in our towel and we asked Irina (housekeeper) if she could wash the towel for us. She said absolutely no problem and we had the towel clean the next day. Rooms are spotless clean, the pension is more of a old character hotel rather than a modern sterile place to stay. Irina bends over backwards as well to help you out with whatever you need. She loves working there and you can tell. The great plus is the staff and the owner Manfred Stuhler. He is that gruff appearing but caring grandfather you adore. He bends over backward to help you out. He is also quite a personality and gives you the straight answers to your questions.

My single room with bath was roomier than many places I've stayed in Europe in this price range. The bed, made up with a warm duvet, was very comfortable; the bathroom was small but functional (note that no toiletries were supplied); the very high ceilings lent a feeling of space; and the room, facing a courtyard, was dead silent at night. A very comfortable velvet-upholstered armchair was a nice unexpected decor touch. The double rooms I saw looked similarly spacious. The proprietor, a friendly older gent named Manfred, was welcoming and helpful. Breakfast was adequate: rolls, cheese and cold cuts, jams and spreads, and bad coffee. Manfred also keeps a nicely stocked fridge full of water, juices and beer, reasonably priced, for guests to partake of around the clock. Charlottenburg is not the most exciting place to stay in Berlin, but it is quiet and safe and seems to be where most if not all of the budget places are. This pension is ideally located, then, since it's a half-block either way from a U-Bahn and an S-Bahn station. You can be in Mitte in 15 minutes. You're also very close to nice, if not cutting-edge, restaurants and bars in Savignyplatz and a string of serious interior-design shops on Kantstrasse. It took about 20 minutes to get to the pension from Tegel airport via the 109 bus to Uhlandstrasse.", "Date": "December 16, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Pension Charlottenburg", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d614076-Reviews-Hotel_Pension_Charlottenburg-Berlin.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "614076", "ImgURL": "http://www.venere.com/img/hotel/4/1/6/3/323614/323614.jpg"}}
