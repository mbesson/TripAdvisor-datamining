Best way from Schonfield Airport is buy a welcome card if you intend to travel around the city this allows you to travel the trains, underground, and trams for free after purchase.It cost 26 euros each and last 72 hours from the first journery you use.(just stamp it at machine at train station first, machine on platform)Walk out Airport turn left walk for 2 mins then cross road you will see Train station.Catch the train for Zoogarten called Airport Express ( one of the main train station) this takes about 35-40 mins tops.Then get underground ( which is just outside train station look for burger king and you will see entrance to UB) catch to wittenbourg which is one stop and come out of station and the hotel in on same street just look for Lidl sign to head in right direction , hotel is just before Lidl.(about 5 mins walk from station) within one hour from gettting of plane we were check in and walking to nearest German bar.You can get Ub to Nordenplatz which is 2 stops then turn right out of station and follow again to Lidl then hotel is just after. (hotel is in middle of both stations) Lidl is open from 8am till 10pm and supermarket just around corner called Kaisers which advertised from 7 am till 24 hr.Both very cheap bottle of dry white wine 2 euros, bottle of vodka 4-5 euros...If you looking for small tradional german bar with good food walk to nordenplatz station stay on hotel side, end of street turn left around corner walk for about 3 mins cross over road by traffic lights and you will see it on corner with chairs outside its called something A, I love german food and this is very tradional for about 7-13 euros a main.If you after a small tradional german bar turn left out of hotel cross road at first lights walk down this street for mins, look for benches outside , its very tradional and friendly barman and locals and VERY CHEAP three large beers, two vodka-tonic, and a german herbal shot come to 13 euros.Slumberland is a carribean bar about 10 mins walk form hotel, with sand on floor would recommend this, walk to Nordenplatz station turn right there cross road walk past lots of bars, restaurants to first lights and its on right side on corner, you can also smoke inside if you want to.We went on open top bus paid 16 euros each which was discounted because of havine Welcome card should be 22 euros.This allows you to travel city and stops 22 stops bus every 15 mins.We have always use them in every city but this one was a little disapointed only because there is so much traffic lights and the journery takes a while to get around, but we still glad we got one.Ka de we the big department store is 5 mins from hotel, is like Harrods worth a visit. Olympic statium is about 15 mins on underground from hotel well worth a visit cost 5 euros to enter stadium this allow discounte from welcome card, just get UB to something like Rubern and get off at stop called Olympic statium turn left at station walk under subway for 800 meters then there.

Still can't quite believe how we managed to get such a cheap deal - \u00a3100pp for flights, 2 nights and breakfast included, when the breakfast was being advertised at the hotel at 15 euros per person per day! We were pleasantly surprised with the rooms that, although a bit small, had everything you need and were very modern. The bathroom is compact but has an amazing shower that makes you feel like you are in a much more expensive hotel! Staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the guy on reception (didn't get his name). Our departing flight wasn't until 9.40pm but the hotel were absolutely fine with us keeping our luggage in their storage facility behind reception. Location was good, although if you want something more central probably best going with a hotel located in the Mitte district but for the price we paid you really can't fault it. There are 2 U-Bahn (underground) stations within easy reach; we used Nollendorfplatz but Wittenburgplatz was a little further up in the other direction. Some good restaurants if you turn right out of the hotel and walk up towards the KaDeWe department store - we found most food to be reasonably priced and we even ate in the Hotel restaurant which was good value for money with good service. I think there were even set menus which were a good price too. We were surprised that there was free internet in the hotel - every other hotel I've been to you have to pay 1 euro or something so this was a definite plus. Berlin is an interesting city but prepared to walk quite a bit. Everything is quite spaced out and we found it hard to get used to finding places as there's no real 'touristy' areas but once we got the hang of the U-Bahn system and which areas had the key places to visit we were absolutely fine. We purchased a Welcome Card at the airport which entitled us to money off attractions (only actually used it once to get 2 euros off the Panoramapunkt tower) but if you are planning to visit lots of museums etc. would be well worth it. Interestingly, Berlin's underground does not have ticket gates say like London and so you could travel for free on it. Although, perhaps not advised as I read that ticket inspectors do travel on there and can fine you 40 euros...although we never encountered or saw one... Overall, I would recommend this hotel for small groups or couples. Perhaps not for stag or hen dos as the hotel is quite sophisticated and quiet although there were some German coach parties that turned up on our last day.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hull, UK", "Title": "\u201cFantastic hotel in a fantastic City!\u201d", "Author": "iluvholidaysHull_UK", "ReviewID": "UR125703753", "Content": "My hubby & i have just returned from a 3-night stay at this fabulous hotel, and it more than lived up to our expectations.

We used both the Wittenburg Platz & Nollendorf Platz U-Bahn stations, both equal distance from hotel but we preferred the Nollendorf one for ease of access. Bought a 3-day Welcome Card from the hotel, just under 24 euros each, and used it for all out travel, plus reduced entry to various museums, ones we had actually planned to visit anyway. As previous reviewers have stated, the lack of tea & coffeee making facilities in the rooms are the only negative point but we managed & it wouldn't discourage us from booking there again. We had a room on the first floor overlooking the main road, absoulutely fine, albeit a bit noisy if you wish to have your window open. Would probably ask for a room at the rear if we came again as we do love to sleep with the window slightly open.

The hotel is well situated (central location), and only a short walk from U Bahn station ''Nollendorf platz'' on the U2 line. A Lidl supermarket is also situated close to the hotel (Ideal for purchasing bottled water etc). Upon arrival at the Ivbergs premium, we were greeted by a friendly (English speaking) receptionist who checked us in quickly & efficiently and issued us with our key card for us room. First impressions of the hotel are excellent as the reception is clean, modern and very contemporary. We had a Twin room that was clean, had comfortable beds, a TV (with a few English channel's) and En-suit bathroom (shower only). The shower was very impressive & the hotel provide you with mini complimentary shower gel, shampoo and a bar of soap. We slept well during our stay with no disruptions. Our room faced the main road, however once the window's were closed you could here no traffic noise! One thing that would of been nice is Tea & Coffee making facilities in our room. However the hotel does have a bar on the ground floor and in your room is a 10% discount voucher for the hotel's bar (nice touch). Other facilities our room had included: - A safe (free of charge) we thought this was excellent as most hotel's I've stayed in have charged guests for use of the safe! - Hair dryer - Make up mirror - Free Wifi (obtain code from Reception) - Telephone - Room service (didn't use) - Mini bar (didn't use) They is also a fridge in your room, However inside the fridge is the Mini-bar - we removed a few bottle's from it so we could store out bottled water in there. (Just remember to put the bottles back when you checkout, so the hotel know if you have used the mini-bar) Breakfast at the Ivbergs was excellent (one of the best). You could choose from a traditional continental Breakfast - croissants, rolls, pastries, breads, jam and marmalade. Or a cooked breakfast (bacon, eggs etc) They was also cold meats, cheeses and breakfast biscuits available too. To drink you could have tea (many different types of tea were offered), coffee or juice (Orange, multivitamin to name a few of the juices). Breakfast is presented as a help yourself buffet. Personally, I was very impressed with the Ivbergs Premium hotel and would certainly recommend, due to it's superb staff, Location, Cleanliness throughout, modern contemporary build, comfortable beds, value for money and great facilities. The hotel's Market seemed to be both business and pleasure (So I felt very welcome here on a city break in Berlin). The hotel's location on Googlemaps is very accurate (However, you cannot see the hotel on street view as it's a new hotel) Upon leaving Nollendorf platz station look for the Lidl supermarket and the hotel is a 1 minute walk past there on the right hand side. Walking time from the U bahn station to the hotel is around 3 minutes. I booked the hotel via Travelrepublic.co.uk and paid only \u00a385 (Yes! \u00a385 complete and final cost for 2 adults, 2 nights in one twin room with breakfast included!)

The location of the hotel is excellent, turn right out of the hotel and you are a 5 min walk from the KaDaWe shopping centre and all the shops, restaurants etc and there was also a lovely Christmas market just a bit further down the road from the KaDaWe (in November.) It's also not far at all from the Berlin Zoo, we visited the zoo on one of the days and it was a great day out. You are also right by the UBahn so it's very easy to explore other parts of the city from this hotel. We did use the UBahn a couple of times to visit some of the larger Christmas markets and it was easy enough and not very expensive. We did a hop on hop off bus tour on one of the days, these stop just outside the KaDaWe and you can buy tickets on the bus and they cover all the main sights and are a good price for a 48 hour ticket. The rooms were very nice, spacious and clean and the beds were very comfy. The shower/bathroom is a bit of an odd design there is basically no door on the bathroom and the shower has a glass door so could be a bit awkward depending who you are staying in the room with!!

The Germans are very friendly people nothing like you would imagine from what you here when in Spain etc. There are bars cafes and restaurants galore.Prices in bars and restaurants same or cheaper than UK and you can drink round the clock. Everywhere is licenced including cafes and bakers. If you are looking for a quiet day or late night drink pop into a cafe or bakers where you will get a large beer for 1.50 euro and a small bottle of vodka etc with 5 UK measures for about 2 euro.

The hotel is in between Nollendorfplatz and Wittenbergplatz U-bahn stations but we always used Nollendfordplatz, getting about is quite straightforward and fairly cheap. We considered buying the 3 day pass but in the end paid for daily tickets; a day group ticket for up to 5 adults was 15 euros, and covered A and B zones. The breakfast is as good as everybody says and fills you up for the day and is served til 10.30am which is a bonus! The shower is AMAZING and I could have stayed in it all day. As I shared a room with my mum the glass shower door was fine but it is a little revealing if sharing with friends. I booked the trip through Easyjet holiays and we paid \u00a3139 each with one suitcase between the 4 of us; we had researched the cost of getting from the airport to the hotel by train, and I also emailed the hotel for a rough quote for a taxi; they replied with a figure of 40-50 euros. When we arrived we simply gave the address to a driver of one of the many taxis outside, and he quoted between 30-35 euros so we decided to take it; it ended up being 32euros which between 4 of us was fine. The hotel also does an airport shuttle run which is advertised at the reception but this is 40 euros for up to 4 people and a bit more for 5+. The hotel is a few minutes from the KaDeWe department store and a realllllly long street full of shops including many well known ones. We ate at San Marco Italian over the road on the first night and it was really nice food and unbelievably dirt cheap. We also ate in the hotel one night and although the menu isn't massive it was another nice meal at a reasonable cost, for a hotel.Our most expensive meal was at a Mexican on or near Potsdamer Platz (think it was called Cancun) and funnily enough was also our least favourite! If you want to see the Brandenburg Gate then it's probably best getting the U-bahn to Potsdamer Platz and walking five mins or so from there - there is a U-bahn station at the Gate but the line is only covered by a shuttle train which just goes back and forth between this stop and 2 others so it's a bit fiddly trying to get there as you can only get the shuttle from a couple of stations. All in all I had a fantastic trip; the only negative for me was that my room was a smoking room and I could tell from the smell as soon as I entered the room. My sister's room was the same and ashtrays and matches were provided in both rooms; I'm not 100% sure but I think every room is smoking, as I wasn't given the option of non smoking when I booked it.

On the other hand, my partner really liked it as she could get her makeup on while I was in the shower, so it's horses for courses.

I would recommend a place called Amait in the nollenderplatz area close to the hotel. Its a indian restaurant, the food was amazing and their was not shortage of it for a very cheap price. we also sat outside to eat which was lovely as it was so hot.

I signed up for a twin bedded room, but since I was a single traveller I got a single room. Not too bad, but then I also got an accesible room which was a shame as you sort of like a bathtub to enjoy a bath - especially when staying a longer period of time. Great thing on the hotel is the A/C (which is why I chose the hotel - it was the cheapest with A/C). I also had breakfast included - but did not use it so cannot commend on it, but the breakfast place looked nice. Location is unbeatable right in between the Nollendorfplatz and the Wittenbergplatz and bording the gay district with loads of bars and restaurants. There was no change of bedlinnen for 5 nights (like at home :-)) but rooms was nicely made every day. Internet is included but on my floor it is not WIFI and the cable you get from the Front Desk only lets you work at the desk (and not laying on the bed - but perhaps it is only me doing that) with an uncomfortable deskchair. Friendly and professional reception team, the housekeeping lady did not speak German or English but with gestures we managed to share a laugh when I thanked her, which is so much more important. The only recommendation for the hotel would be to never ever allow a third party to undercut your own selling rates as you are loosing out double and to ask if someone minds or does not mind an accesible rooms.

The Shoenfeld express is the easiest way to travel from that Airport which stops at Oterbahnhof, Alexanderplatz, and a few more stops. The locacation of Hotel Ivberg required us to get off the train at Zoo garten. We then took the line 2 ( red ) to Nollendorfplatz, 2 stops. The Hotel is situated on the opposite side of the road which is a right turn, just past Lidl. The price of the ticket is 3 euros and is valid for 90 mins. A day ticket for zones A and B costs 6 euro 30 and is valid through until 3 am. The Hotel offers a superb breakfast, this was included in our price, it costs 15 euro if it aint included which is a little steep. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable with flat screen TV, free safe and a nice walk in shower. Anyone who complains about this hotel must be hard to please. Turn right from the hotel doors take you to Wittenberplatz, this is where the famous Ka De We store is situated and is Berlins answer to Harrods. Left from the hotel and accross the road at Nollendorf u bahn are many bars and restaurants, al;l of which are not expensive. If you like ke baps, there is a little one called Mocco at the top of the street, there you can sit inside and enjoy a beer. To the right of the kebab place is a themed pub called Slumberland, it`s a carribean bar with a floor covered with sand, this place is a gopod cheap place to chat with locals and tourists alike. There are many other bars down the side streets offering good food and beers. An Italian Restaurant accross the road from the hotel offers a very good menu at reasonable prices, and it is comfortable. I would reccoomend this location because it`s a quiet area and easy to get to all the major attractions Berlin has to offer. It is a very big city and a little bit of homework regarding the s bahn and u bahn prior your trip would be good. Familiarise yourself with the city by reading up on thew web and books because this will serve you well and you will enjoy the vacation more having done so, If your a sports fan, a visit to the olympic stadium is a must. Again, from Nollendorf, line 2 (red) in the direction of ruhleben takes you within 5 mins walk under the low subway. It costs 4 euro to go and look at the staduim and go inside. Well worth a visit. Another trip worth doing and some books do not mention this, if you are looking for a part of the wall that still remains then get to Bernauer strasse. Easiest way is take the u bahn to Alexanderplatz then U9 (blue). Follow the tramlines down the hill and the wall is there. Also there is a memorial with has pictures of those who perished.

Once we got to the hotel we realised it was in a good location, only less than 5 minute walk from KaDeWe and other shopping streets, also the City Circle sightseeing bus was very close by! There is also lots of nice restaurants within walking distance! The hotel itself was nice, it is very new and clean but lacked any type of character and was very quiet with no atmosphere! staff were friendly and helpful!! rooms were small but had everything needed, shower was great, very big and powerful!! but bathrooms were not very private and there were very few tolieteries supplied especially for a 4 star! Breakfast was good and there was a good choice!
