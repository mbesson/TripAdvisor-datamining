I am sorry but before I go on a 16 hour flight, i'd like to take a hot shower and I could not even do this. I had dinner there at their buffet & the food was uneatable with flies roaming around the food everywhere. Absolutely disgusting and horrible experience. Also, they do not have wake up calls.

The hotel serves the purpose for a night or two, but they miss the fine things. Firstly, the towels and bathmats for the bathroom in the room are generally torn and ripped. Housekeeping or the management do not pay attention to these necessities. The carpets in the rooms I've stayed in over the past 4 months are stained, so, again, the hotel management is not paying attention to properly having the carpets shampooed. On my last trip, housekeeping left one set of towels and not two. Maybe they're cutting back or housekeeping wasn't do their job? The breakfast is cheap, meaning, the buffet offerings are not only on the cheap side, but it looks as if it's been set up as an after-thought. One day, the eggs are soft-boiled, with three pots of the same choices of croissants. The next day, there are no eggs. Poorly prepared sausages or Turkey Bacon or on display in the heated-looking but not warm serving pots. The rest of the buffet is not replenished. Finally, no attendants are actively cleaning the tables, hence, it's usually a hunt to find a clean table. Overall if you're needing a hotel that's convenient to the terminals with a free shuttle only to terminals 1 and 3 (you have to take a cab to terminal 2), then this is fine. But, don't expect the same quality you get at other InterContinental Group hotels like the Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn or Holiday Inn Express.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cDecent hotel if you're staying near the airport and don't want to go too far into town\u201d", "Author": "moaksey", "ReviewID": "UR124088196", "Content": "I just stayed here for a couple of days. I was in Dubai for business, visiting a trade show at the Airport Expo which is a 5 minute ride from this hotel. The price was way higher than expected but that's Dubai! When booking it seemed to have everything I'd need so I went ahead. When I arrived at DXB I did check to see if there was a free shuttle bus around. There was one waiting for another Holiday Inn but the driver said my hotel's one only came once an hour. Oh well. I got a very short taxi ride to the hotel at 3am. Check in was good but took longer than expected. Whenever you communicate with any of the reception staff they look at you, listen then stare at their computer screen for 5 minutes before acknowledging you - apart from the ladies on day shift who were lovely. Anyway, reception took a while as they said they were fully booked and it'd take a while. This surprised me at 3am but it is an airport hotel so I wasn't angry. The hotel faces the airport terminal which would have been amazing for me. I, however, ended up with a room at the back of the property which was just as good. I asked for an iron as soon as I arrived and one came within minutes. The room itself was clean, comfortable and well equipped. There were no bottles of complimentary mineral water which you tend to get at all hotels in DXB which was surprising. They did sell it in the lobby for 10 Dhs a pop. I had internet included in my room rate (although I had to question this when I checked in as I expect most rates don't include it). There is wifi in the lobby but only wired connections in the rooms. Basic internet was fine but I didn't get my work VPN to work for more than 30 seconds which made being online pretty useless as I was there for business. The breakfast was basic but plentiful, with a decent selection. It's definitely a step above other Holiday Inn Express properties I've stayed at. The bar was nice and relaxing. The restaurant in the evening was good. I was put off at first as I didn't want the buffet, but they said they had a small a la carte menu which I could choose from. This was very small but the food was good (I had curry). There is a hotel taxi service so you can pretty much always get one when you leave. Although the cars are nice, big SUVs, they do have standard meters so are just as cheap as others. The drivers are all good - friendly too. Most of the guests are obviously in transit so it did feel a bit like an airport terminal at times but again, it's an airport hotel so what else can you expect? The gym was good - large and with enough equipment to keep you busy. Great views of the airport too. Check out was alright. I had to question an internet charge which took a while. I was then confused by four 1.67 Dhs charges which said they were allocated to phone calls - of which I made none. The receptionist explained to me that it wasn't for calls - it was for the hotel's accounts and was a rounding up of one of the room taxes. I am still not convinced and think it's a bit dodgy (although the total adds up to less than $2). So, for a short stay this place is great - especially if you've done Dubai before and want to avoid it.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawaii", "Title": "\u201cGood for an overnight.\u201d", "Author": "aerowise", "ReviewID": "UR124029221", "Content": "This hotel is definitely adequate for 1 or 2 nights if waiting on a flight.

I stayed again in Nov 2011. Good deal for the price, nice new rooms, nice bed, pillows, TV, etc. Quiet, and a good sleep. Of course, it only takes one bad experience to ruin the visit: I had bought a new CamelBak backpack earlier in the day before checking in, and as I was unpacking, I took it out and brought it to the sink in the bathroom to fill with water. I placed it in the sink and filled it up, then when I pulled it out, I saw white stuff all over it! The cleaning staff didn't clean my sink, and it was covered with old toothpaste from the previous occupant. I didn't think to look in the sink before putting the backpack in it first, as it was supposed to be clean! The sink was disgusting, and I don't know how the cleaning staff missed it. Of course, my brand new $120 backpack was now smeared with someone else's used toothpaste and spit, making me not very happy. And after the experiences I had the last time I stayed, I have decided not to return. I spent the next hour scrubbing my new backpack and trying not to be grossed out. I called the desk and told them about it, they sent some kid up to wipe the sink out, without a word or apology. But what are you going to do? The other issue is with the mafia chauffer people outside, which are outside every Holiday Inn in Dubai. I complained about it last time, but the management hasn't changed anything. Basically, they keep a town-car outside for guests, which is fine. Some people may want a pricey, chauffeured car to get around. If they advertised it as such, it would be fine. But when you walk outside, they they come up to you \"Taxi, sir? Taxi? You need taxi?\" They try to pass it off as a taxi, which it obviously isn't. A trip to Festival City Mall costs about $5 in a real taxi, these jerks charge you about $15. Reading through the reviews, I've seen many people tricked by this. I yelled at the guy, saying yes, I DO want a taxi, and will wave one down, and he started talking smack abou the real taxis, saying they are dangerous, expensive, can't be trusted, many accidents, etc. Why do they feel the need to trick the customer? Why not just call it a \"private car\", which is what it is? Anyway, don't fall for it. Real taxis are safe, clean and cheap and pass by all the time. I never waited more than 1 minute for one. What makes me really mad is that the hotel staff won't call one for you, only direct you to the chauffeur outside. I'm sure the hotel runs it, which is why they haven't changed their policy since the last time I stayed. Otherwise, it's a clean, safe hotel, a little expensive, but ok. Breakfast was ok, but the coffee is instant and was horrible. What, brewed coffee is too much to ask?

I ended up having to jump in a cab (which cost about \u00a310) and race to the airport, but thanks to Holiday Inn I missed the check in for my flight (it closed early due to some airspace restrictions that day), and I had to spend the night in the airport. Another point that riled me was that they chose to charge my card when I checked in (rather than when I booked), and use their poor exchange rate, which meant that the room cost me about \u00a310 more that the price shown when I booked. The room itself was fine, although you don't get any complimentary toiletries, the hair and body wash had not been filled up and there were only 2 English speaking channels on the TV.

For what they charge I think the rooms are very overpriced considering that most people will incur extra expenses in having to get cabs to and from the airport - the cabs are notorious for ripping off customers. Also, wi-fi is very pricey and the staff on reception are quite sullen and unhelpful, especially about the shuttle bus service and directions on how to get around.

Just an observation. Anyway, I had booked for two nights and I arrived in Dubai in the evening and phoned the hotel about the shuttle bus and was informed that it should arrive at 1945 as it was out of hours. And it did arrive at 1945. A short ride to the hotel and I checked in painlessly, whilst overcoming people who jumped the queue. I have found that in this part of the world and some other parts of Asia, this is the same; you just have to be a \u2018bit alpha\u2019 about standing your turn in the queue. Checking in was painless, the room was spotless (even for a smoking room) and the air-conditioning was very welcome as it was searingly hot outside. Great choice of TV channels, but I had a slight problem connecting to the internet, so I phoned reception and within two minutes, someone had come to the room and sorted it out. Very good service indeed. The trip to the bar was, erm, interesting as one other reviewer put it and I did people watch, but got a little annoyed when the people watching turned into being approached by the people I was watching. I only wanted a quiet beer before having some food. If you are female and you go into the bar, then I suspect you will not have a problem. The food in the restaurant was good. A buffet meal for AED 59 with a great range of food. I ended up taking a tray of food to my room which was infinitely better than sitting on my own in the restaurant. On the second night, the food was largely the same with a few changes to some of the dishes, however this isn\u2019t really a problem as I expect guests don\u2019t stay for too many nights with it being an airport hotel. The following day I had to take a journey out and was pointed in the direction of the hotel taxi, which I thought might be expensive, but was pleasantly surprised when the bill came in quite low and that was without a meter. I suspect the local taxis might have been cheaper, but for convenience, this was perfect. I enquired about the shuttle bus to take me back to the airport when I was leaving and the receptionist told me that it would leave on the hour. And it did. So no problems there. Again, I am not sure why one reviewer was so het up about the shuttle bus (mainly lack of information on the website I guess, but you can always pick up the phone). Oh and the breakfast was also fine, which is the standard continental fayre, however in the UK, they now do offer a hot option as well, so Dubai Airport franchise, you may want to pick this up. All in all, a great, convenient hotel at a great price. If you\u2019re not bothered about having a drink, then you won\u2019t baulk at the bar prices and in the reception there are snacks and water that you can purchase, so you don\u2019t actually need to leave the hotel.

This was not the case here and would stay again as price was very good. The work area in the room was quite cramped and as such I moved to the bar to have more space to work and some WiFi as there is none in the room (and a beer of course). Whether or not you get in-room WiFi still seems to be hit and miss across hotels around the world but If you have the cash to put a 2nd phone in the toilet, then corridor located WIFi should not be a stretch! The hotel bar.... quite an experience to say the least, do drop in for a beer and a spot of people watching. Seems the room price is being subsidised by the rather expensive prices for a pint (and the internet!) but given the heat you just went through waiting for the shuttle or a taxi, you will pay whatever for a cold drink !", "Date": "July 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kolkata (Calcutta), India", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel to stay near airport\u201d", "Author": "debdoot_2000", "ReviewID": "UR115658707", "Content": "From rooms you can see flights departing and landing.

Why don\u2019t they put the shuttle details on their web page? Then I would have bothered and wouldn\u2019t have wasted my money. It is stupid for HI Ex to think that the information on the shuttle pick up can be given on arrival! On arrival, I was told the shuttle time table and it is not like the US where you can phone up, it is only hourly and such a poor service. I was also told on arrival there are no wake up calls, and the hotel staff were of a take it or leave it nature. I also found in the rooms that the liquid soap had crystals or mould growing in it, that there were black marks on the sheets, and that in the 40C heat (>105F) they provide a duvet on the bed suitable for -10C. How impossible! Very, very frustrating. To make it worse, early in the morning the cleaning staff talk and shout loudly to each other up and down the corridors and they bang and clash their cleaning trolleys. Even when I opened the door and asked for quiet they started shouting loudly to each other within a few minutes. As for breakfast, there is a fairly decent selection but the WORST coffee every, anywhere in the world. It is so bad! It looks like coffe but tastes like nothen, maybe dishwater. Even when I tried 3 shots of the expresso, it cam out like some awful black tasteless muck. Why bother with coffe if it is dreadful? This was the worst coffee I have had anywhere in the world!

Getting back to the airport using the shuttle was not a problem. The hotel need to implement a half hourly shuttle service when they know that guests will be arriving by plane. Reception was efficient, but my Priority Club membership was no recognised, but no worry. The room was excellent, it is the sort of place I wish I could take with me everywhere I travel. Beautiful decor and one of the most comfortable beds on my travels, it had a solid choice of TV channels and a good bathroom. I only ate breakfast here and it was fairly average, not much variety. The hotel is isolated from the major sites of Dubai, but that is probably not the reason why you would stay here in the first place. If you do have some spare time, just head to the Emirates Metro station which is under a 10 minute walk, and from there most of the cities sites are within reach. Remember it is a Holiday Inn Express so it is not full of facilities or services such as room service, but for that trade-off (which I am happy to make) you get a modern room for an excellent price.

They all said it was too close, and to wait for the shuttle. I hated this, as I was tired and it was hot in the parking garage, and I had to lug my bags over to the shuttle area (which IS NOT marked, by the way, so I had no idea where to go). I saw some shuttles from other hotels, so I walked over there and eventually a shuttle showed up. Anyway, I show up at the airport and even though it's 4am, there is a line and only two overworked employees at the front desk. Finally I get checked in and a female employee gives me room 288. I go up to the room and open the door to find...a guy lying in bed eating a sandwich. He freaks out, I freak out... I shut the door. By now I'm tired, hot and stinky and just want to collapse, but I have to go back to the front desk, wait in line again, and the girl just says sorry and tells me she gave me the wrong room number. I read some other reviews here and this isn't the first time they've done this, evidently. She tells me sorry, and I tell her she needs to apologize to the guy in 288, too. So finally I get to my room, nice enough, very clean and new, no smells. The room has a window but it looks into the inside of the building, as it's an empty square design. No big deal. No view outside anyway except the airport across the highway. First thing I want to do is take a shower, so I turn on the water and wait and wait.......finally I call the front desk (no answer) so I say enough already and go to bed. The next morning I head down to the breakfast, which was really nothing but toast, jams, cereal and absolutely the worst coffee I've ever had. It may sound petty, but the coffee was my biggest complaint about this place. It is instant and comes out of a machine, and it was the most vile, bitter, metallic tasting, non-drinkable stuff imaginable. I did eat the musli and croissants, however. Anyway, I went to the front desk to complain about no hot water in the room, as no one answers the phone, and she said she would send a worker up. He showed up in 15 minutes and what's his solution? He turns the sink and shower on full throttle for 10 minutes. He says they have a solar array on the roof that heats the water, but it takes a long time to reach certain rooms. I like how everywhere in the bathroom are signs asking the customer to conserve water, don't wash your towel everyday, etc, but then install a solar water heater that makes the user waste 25 gallons of water before even getting in the shower. The place is new, the shower stall was nice, except it wasn't put together properly and the door didn't close all the way, meaning the water splashed out into the floor, so when I got out of the shower, I was to step in a nice cold puddle of water. Also, we pay $100 a night for a hotel room and they don't offer wi-fi in the rooms? They DO offer it in the busy lobby, but then charge $15 an hour to use it? I don't mind paying for wi-fi, but at least let me get it in my room, not have to try to do business in the noisy and busy lobby. Nonsense. One more thing, the rooms are REALLY small and tight. The space between the end of my bed and the desk was about 1 foot. You barely have room to pull the chair back from the desk to sit down. It's more convenient to sit on the end of your bed to work on your desk. See the pics. They really stuffed the rooms into this place. I don't think it would have hurt them to give one or two more feet of room. The place has a nice little fitness center, but I can't tell you as my key card wouldn't unlock the door. For what I paid, you'd think that would be included. Did I have to go to the front desk again to get it added? Or get a separate card? I gave up. One other problem I had is trying to get a taxi. When you walk out, there is a black Lincoln Towncar, and they really push it on you. I guess everyone is getting a kickback from it. Every time I left, the security guard would ask me \"Taxi?\" and I'd say yes, and he'd hustle me over to the Towncar. I'd say, \"No, I want a taxi\", and the idiots would argue \"This IS a taxi, sir!\" and I'd say \"No, that's a private car, a chauffered towncar. That's NOT a taxi.\" and so on, until I finally gave up and waved a cab down in the street. They come by often, so it wasn't a problem. The taxi was around 10-15 AED, the Towncar around 50 AED. Don't be tricked or conned into getting into that Towncar, it's a scam and the hotel should be ashamed of itself for trying to force the guests into it. I'm guessing the driver gives a kickback to someone. There's really no reason for it, there are plenty of clean, cheap taxis in the area. Also, when I asked at the front desk if they would call me a cab, they tried to get me to take the Towncar as well, and basically refused to call a cab when I refused to take the Towncar. Again, I just went out to the street and waved down a taxi. The front desk, the security guard, and the two guys in civilian clothes at the car, avoid talking to them about a taxi. Just get one yourself, as they won't help you. Also, the new Dubai Metro station \"Emirates\" is a short walk up the road from the hotel. I walked there several times and got a day pass, you have the entire Metro at your convenience.", "Date": "May 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Paranaque", "Title": "\u201cGreat value at a good price.\u201d", "Author": "stefrfc", "ReviewID": "UR105967061", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel at the begining of April on a stop over between flights.

The restaurant was nice inside and I had the buffet meal for dinner which is very cheap although there could have been a bit more of a choice for my liking but there is always the menu if you wish something different. No big deal for me. The bar is very nice with a good selection of drinks and the staff there I found to be very welcoming. The room was not as big as I am used to but hey, you get what you pay for and it was well worth the money. The bathroom was nice although the one thing I did notice was that the door stop on the back of the bathroom door was broken, again it did not hamper my stay and just a minor point. I requested an iron and ironing board and it was brought to my room in a timely manor also so no complaint there either. They have a bus service to the terminals that is well worth using as there are only independant taxis outside and they are expensive, about twice the price as normal taxis in Dubai.

Made my book 2 months before traveling, thus got a very good price. However, its a good idea to shop around the various website. Having emailed the hotel (reservation.airport@hiexdubai.ae) regarding the free airport shuttle, I was sent a timetable. The service leaves just outside Terminal 3 Arrivals, every hour at 40 minutes. There was no problems here, it was on time, just had to wait 10-15 minutes. (Which was helpful, as both my mother and I have difficulty walking long distances.) The checkin process was fast enongh. Rooms were clean and to a good standard. Towels and soaps are provided, also coffee/tea make facilities. Breakfast was okish, I'd say 7/10...........I have had better and have had worst. Cereals, fresh fruits, yogurts, toast, pastries, juices, coffee, tea were all avalible in the buffet, but no hot foods such as eggs, bake beans etc. However, when you're on a budget, the option of breakfast included in the price is plus. Hotel is not based near anything, but if your planning to take a taxi everywhere its ok. If you need a night or 2 stay and want to be near the airport.........then yes, go for this one. The Airport shuttle from the hotel leaves every hour, on the hour, back to the Airport. Its free and very convenient, but be aware, I've heard there can be a queue for this 12 seater shuttle.

From my room, I could see the apron of Terminal 3 and the Emirates jets taxiing about. I could not hear a sound though and the curtains close out the light very well too. So location is good if you just need a bed between two flights. If you want to do sightseeing on foot or just walk around a little this is not the place as there is nothing in the neighborhood. I took a rental car so it didn't matter to me. The rooms are pretty much international chain standard in size and amenities, cleaning of the bathroom could have been better - there was some lotion (or worse) on the vertical part of the sink. Rest of the bathroom and the room itself were clean. There is a bar in the hotel where you can buy drinks (also alcoholic beverages) but the fridge in the room is empty (I didn't expect beer or the like but a bottle of water or some sodas wouldn't hurt - rather inconvenient to walk to the bar for a bottle of water). There is free parking for guests in the underground garage. A bit disappointing: breakfast: a) it starts at 6 am only - strange for a hotel that must be getting 95% of its customers from the 24/7 airport next door b) choice was quite limited: no eggs, no cold cuts, nothing hot like grilled tomatoes / potatoes, no beef or turkey sausages. I didn't see any information that they would start limited service with a \"continental\" breakfast and go for full breakfast later so I have to assume that's all there is... I'm not a real breakfast person but jetlag can make you very hungry at an unusual hour so I took issue with this. To be fair: you definitely won't starve as there is jam, cheese, joghurt, fruit, muesli but it's still definitely substandard. Note: if you think it doesn't matter as you are probably entitled to a free breakfast at the airport courtesy of Emirates: prepare to queue for half an hour to get in that restaurant in the first place.

Initially, I was a bit apprehensive as I had read a lot of the reviews here about the supposedly unreliable airport shuttle, so I emailed the hotel beforehand to inform them of my times and they replied with a schedule of their buses. The buses pick passengers up from the Arrivals Area (not Departures, as some other reviewers experienced) outside Exit 2. The buses depart every 40 minutes past the hour every 24 hours (1.40, 2.40, 3.40 and so on) and when I was there it was on-time. Encountered no problems with the airport shuttle at all. The hotel itself is a 5 minute drive away. As I had arrived at their doorstep at 8 in the morning, there was no room ready. However the receptionist told me there would be one ready in an hour. In the meantime, I requested to have the next day's complimentary breakfast at that time, as my flight out the next day was before breakfast began (6am). They were very obliging. The breakfast spread was quite simple but good enough - cereal, toast, bread, croissants, labaneh yogurt, tomatoes, olives and cucumber, yogurt, milk and juices. As promised, the room was ready in an hour. It is not big but more than enough for a short stay. The room and bathroom were spotless - I have absolutely no complaints. A shampoo/body wash was provided in a dispenser; if you are more comfortable using toiletries you are more familiar with I suggest you bring your own. There is no free internet in this hotel; the rates are actually quite ridiculous! However, there is a computer at the Priority counter at the reception that can be used for short access to anything important. I'm not sure if it is only for the Priority Club members, though, but I saw many people use it and the receptionists didn't seem to mind. I took a taxi from the hotel to Dubai Mall - it cost 50 Dhs. The hotel also provides a shuttle to Festival City and the Emirates Metro - enquire at the reception for more information. I got back to the hotel by taking a Metro to the airport, and met the airport shuttle there to take me back. Airport shuttles from the hotel to the airport depart on the hour, every hour, 24 hours. The staff at this hotel were very friendly and helpful. I thought that this stay was good value (I paid almost 80 Euros for a night - it's a bargain by Dubai standards) and it is definitely more than enough for a short stay.

How many people travel with a jump drive? My visit to Dubai was during Ramadan, which I know nothing about.

I was a little worried about the 2* factor since I always go for nothing but the best out there.

In addition, they were arriving early in the morning and I didn't want to have to travel from Abu Dhabi so early in the morning. Hence, I stayed one night at this airport. I read reviews from another website that it is very difficult to find but I was glad that the location map emailed to me by the hotel meant that I didn't even get lost trying to get to it (I normally get lost driving around Dubai!) They ample parking at the basement but the only thing is the exit ramp lane is very narrow and one has to be careful if you have a big car like mine. It was very tight at the turning to exit the carpark as there is a column at the turn. The room even offered \"soft\" and \"firm\" pillows option which I was really impressed with. It is also very quiet, so, one can get a good rest. I don't have much issues with the hourly shuttle although I've heard many complaints from others on this. It would have been great if they also have hourly shuttle to the nearest shopping mall such as Dubai Festival City. As I hate driving in Dubai, I wasn't going to drive to find the next shopping mall! The only rather amusing thing was the Cisco telephone has a private welcome message except I'm not the person they welcomed!

By the time I got there it was well after 10 pm, and I had to check out to catch the 6 am shuttle to the airport. So there you have it. And ordinarily I wouldn't even be writing a review of the Holiday Inn Express, let alone being in it for so short a time. But I was impressed. It is NOT the same establishment as in the U.S. Maybe because it's Dubai. Or maybe it's that they are revamping and all the new ones are like this. Either way I was impressed. This is meant to be a bare-bones hotel, so I wouldn't expect the same amenities as at the Emirates Palace. But still, check-in was efficient and friendly. (The one negative was that the airline told us the hotel van would be picking us up from the sidewalk, and I only saw one hotel van - and it didn't stop. But I don't know that this was the hotel's fault or that of the airline which was pretty disorganized as it was and maybe didn't tell the hotel... we ended up taking a taxi and the hotel paid the fare.) This hotel is really, really pretty, with sage green and lavender textiles, and while small, the bathrooms, including shower stalls, were laid out really nicely. Everything so crisp and clean! I very much appreciated the clock radio which had an alarm, and the safe, which was wonderful to have. Because I was socializing, I only got an hour of sleep, and I remember laying down and thinking I would just rest, because who falls asleep in an hour when they know they've got to be up to catch a flight - but the bed was really comfortable, the linens crisp and with a choice of hard and soft pillows (I chose the hard), I just fell right asleep! My room didn't have a view, but hey, it's a hotel room, who cares. The hotel has a bar (hence the socializing), which is nice, and they even gave me a drink gratis at one point. At one point there had to have been at least 25 of us stranded travelers at the bar and they did a great job handling the demand (and distributing free popcorn). Elevators were plentiful and efficient. There is a gratis breakfast in the morning but it opens at 6 - and there's an hourly free shuttle to the airport as well, but it leaves on the hour beginning at 6, and I needed to be on it, so I didn't get to try the breakfast.
