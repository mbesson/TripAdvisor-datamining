{"Reviews": [{"Content": "One of my favorites As noted by others location is not central but as in most German cities if you are near a train station that is all that really matters. This a nice functional small hotel. Everything works. There are 4 pillows and iron already in the room. Hanger space is ample. Apart from that everything is extra - breakfast, internet, even the gym. No hot drinks maker. THe hotel is next to a huge mall where you can restock on western supplies if you are on an overnight stopover on an extended trip to eastern Europe or Africa. The gym is in the mall. Watch out if you like to sleep in a cold room. There is no aircon. The linens could be fresher. But the bath water is the best I have ever experienced for softness and PH. You will be silky smooth after your shower. The hotel system ie for bookings, entering the hotel, getting to your room etc, is not the most seamless but the staff make up for it by their courtesy and efficiency. I like this place.", "Date": "Oct 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR892169473", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "taoben"}, {"Content": "Nice Hotel with tiny rooms! This hotel is located in the nothwestern part of Frankfurt, on the U-Bahn stop, Nordwest Zentrum Although this hotel is not close to either downtown or the airport, it is attached to a large shopping mall and small amusement center. The hotel offers free champagne and appetizers at night, but no free breakfast. There are plenty of dining choices outside the hotel in the mall, some of the restaurants do offer english menus. The hotel is about a 45 minute U-Bahn ride from the Frankfurt Main Airport. You will have to ride three different trains. The hotel is on the U-1 line. The rooms are quite small, but clean and quiet. The staff speaks english, and there are two english channels on the TV.", "Date": "Jan 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR114109772", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "kelpie99"}, {"Content": "Decent hotel north of the city centre. I usually stay much closer to the city centre in Frankfurt but had a hard time booking my regular hotel due to a number of large conventions so I had to stay further north at the Courtyard hotel.I was able to take a tram from AM Main and arrive at the hotel in about 20 minutes. It was a little difficult to find the hotel (attached to the shopping centre) but after asking some people, I was able to figure it out.The hotel was clean and comfortable with nothing really out of the ordinary. I would recommend a stay at the Courtyard if the main city centre hotels like the Movenpick and Marriott have raised their prices for a convention and you don't mind taking a tram for 20 minutes to get where you need to go.", "Date": "Jan 14, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR663769560", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "reclermo"}, {"Content": "Out of town but easy for the train       View from hotel window", "Date": "Jan 6, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR545938264", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "CCarterRN"}, {"Content": "Could Be Better But You Can't Beat the Enormous Connecting Shopping Centre This property's main attribute is its direct proximity to a huge shopping centre. That makes the trip worth while.The staff is nice but a bit inexperienced and disorganized. The first night the staff did not have Internet access cards, which is the only way to access the business centre. That made using the business centre impossible (here the customer loses out)The second day the front desk guy did not know how to use the safe system. He thought that we had some imaginary card to open the safe with our key.The property also attached to a swimming pool compex, which is quite convenient.Count on at least a 30 minute U-Bahn ride into the centre of the city. If you like to shop and be around a real shopping centre, this property is great. if you want to be in the centre of it all, this is not the place to stay.", "Date": "Jan 3, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR443620533", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Cyberworld Toronto"}, {"Content": "Hotel in a shopping mall I booked this for a business overnight expecting a typical courtyard experience ie. clean room good breakfast and then on my way.After passing the hotel in a place that wasn\u9225\u6a9b even in my GPS and thinking to my self, there\u9225\u6a9a no way my hotel is in a shopping mall I found rooms were very dated, only a simple bar, and hotel restaurant closed early.

While the hotel's location is a bit out of town, it was very easy to get into town as the subway was in the connecting mall...the front desk sells special passes for tourists on the subway and it was very helpful as I don't read German and all the ticket machines are in German. The staff and service was excellent. I spent 3 nights at the hotel then went to Berlin for 4 nights and returned to hotel for 2 more nights. While in Berlin, the hotel kept my very large piece of luggage (had just returned from 2 weeks in Egypt) and upon my return from Berlin, they had placed it in my room...so nice not to have to lug it upon my return. The breakfast buffet was excellent and a good bargain. They serve cold meats so it great to be able to make a couple sandwiches (great rolls!) to have throughout the day to help with my expenses. The rooms were very spacious and the bed was so so comfortable. Again, while it is not the most convenient hotel to Frankfurt city, it a great alternative and I would most definitely stay here again.", "Date": "Nov 18, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR249472558", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "travelgirl67"}, {"Content": "Way out of the way... We came in to Frankfurt after a 10 day vacation, knowing we had to fly out the next morning. We tend to like Marriott hotels so I thought the Courtyard would be nice. It was rather shabby.The area had gone from about 58 to 93 degrees in a matter of days and we were there. Our room faced the west, and when we checked in the afternoon, the windows were wide open and it was hot as could be, sun streaming in. This hotel has no AC. Well, since we on the top floor, we didn't sleep due to the heat (no breeze either). The front desk did arrange to have their own cabby their for us the next morning to take us to the airport --- it cost $32 Euro. This is not convenient for travelers to the airport or main train station. Yes, they did have a train station beneath, but it is so far away, that using that to get to the airport (which I thought was going to be a bonus), was going to kill us for time. It is just too far away.We did walk the mall (trying to escape the heat in the room), only to find that it is not air-conditioned either. The entire glass roof made it worse than our room. NOw I realize that for probably 10 mos of the yr, this would be lovely for cooler Frankfurt visitors, but the Mall was NOT the place to be in the heat, and there is no where else nearby. If I ever go back -- I would find something more centrally located to the main train station.", "Date": "Jun 1, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR249079789", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "DunhillMom"}, {"Content": "Pleasant Surprise! I booked this room without much to go by for reviews or pictures because I was visiting Frankfurt during a convention time and it was one of the only rooms available. I booked it at $111 euro (which included a generous breakfast) when comparable rooms were going for $300 euro+. I was visiting Frankfurt for leisure not business so I'm not sure how it would suit a business traveler, but it suited me fine. The location was nice, just literally steps away from NordwestZentrum, a pleasant shopping area/mall. The shopping area has restaurants, pharmacies, grocery stores, deli's, etc, so you can buy some cheap snacks and bottles of water for your room. The train and bus stop are downstairs of the mall so transportation is really conveniant and easy. They have a nice pool/fitness center that literally shares the building with the hotel, but I didn't get a chance to go. Next time I'll definately check it out, as I'll be staying here on future trips to Frankfurt. The staff is pleasant and professional, answering questions and arranging for cabs for us. The rooms are clean and nicely decorated in a modern but cozy fashion. I didn't like the two beds pushed together to make one king size bed, but that's fairly common. The pillows and sheets were soft and very fresh in smell and appearance. There is a small television, a dresser, and a small table with chair. The bathroom was clean and well lit. Decent size shower/tub combination with a full shower curtain (some places have no shower curtain or half!). It was rather windy when I was there and we had a corner room with a large window, but we slept well.Breakfast was included in our rate which was a nice bonus. It was a generous spread of cereals, breads, pastries, sausages,bacon, ham, eggs, cold cuts and cheese, made to order omelets, fruit, bagels,jams, honey, oatmeal, tea, and coffea. Alot of hotels charge $10-$20 euro per person, so this was a nice treat at no extra cost.", "Date": "Feb 17, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR224517182", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "meeps"}, {"Content": "Gerne wieder   showReview(20554056, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR586631129", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d199347-r20831527-Courtyard_by_Marriott_Frankfurt_Nordwest_Zentrum-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "199347", "Price": "$193"}}
