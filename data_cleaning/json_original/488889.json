This is in my favorite part of Rome, right next to the Piazza Navona. It is also fairly close to the Pantheon or Campo dei Fiori, and is not too long a walk to St. Peter's or the Forum. There is a taxi stand very close by, and the bus routes along the Corso Vittorio Emanuele are not far either. If you know where to look, there are some nice restaurants tucked into the winding streets nearby. Over all, this is a very good place to stay, and I would not mind staying here again. It rates well on helpful staff and location. It is kind of pricey, but by Roman standards, it is a good deal. I've stayed here twice, and once with a friend staying in a separate room in the same place. The street noise varies. Generally, lower rooms against the Via dei Coronari are louder. Rooms away from there or higher up are quieter. One problem is that the floors are not carpeted, so if you have noisy neighbors upstairs, you might get woken early by their clomping about. Some mornings this was not a problem, but other mornings it definitely was -- it all depends on who is above you. Staying here in April, we had trouble getting the temperature cool enough. The hotel's air system was not yet onto fully cool mode, so the best we could do was stop heat from coming out, though the room would eventually warm up over time. We could open the window to cool the room off, but that let in more street noise. We kind of managed, but other rooms on our trip were much easier to regulate temperature than here. The terrace room on the top is really wonderful, and is a little oasis of calm in a busy city. There is no elevator, and you need to go up at least 2 flights of stairs to get to your room. I don't mind this, but if you have trouble with stairs, be warned. The hotel's breakfast is fine, but not spectacular. The staff is uniformly friendly and helpful. They are helpful carrying your bags up those stairs or arranging transport. Speaking of which, their airport transportation offer is a great deal. It's about 10 euro more than a cab, but is a much nicer car (Mercedes or Audi), has very friendly drivers, and they even meet you at baggage claim holding a sign.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clarendon Hills, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location and service\u201d", "Author": "ImmerWandern", "ReviewID": "UR127601200", "Content": "We spent a few days in Rome at this very unassuming yet superbly located hotel. Here is a quick summary: Good: 1. Central location - major sights easy walking distance away 2. Can arrange pick-up service from the airport - worth the money 3. Cabs and buses nearby 4. Friendly and helpful staff 5. Good breakfast 6. Fairly large, clean rooms 7. Many dining options in the area 8. Free Wi-Fi - reliable service The \"not-so-good\" comments are not to be considered deal-breakers but more of caveats: 1. Potentially difficult to find - use pick up service if flying into Rome 2. Via dei Coronari can be noisy on weekend nights 3. No elevator - pack light 4. No nearby Metro underground station - but did not really need it. They offered to arrange a pick-up service from Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino airport. It was an excellent service; our ride was a late-model E-series Mercedes (essentially a limousine given the narrow streets and mostly small cars in Rome) and the driver, Alessandro, spoke excellent English. He gave us a quick run-down of the monuments we were passing on the way to the hotel. All this for the price of a regular cab. It was a perfect, no-hassle start to the vacation and, if you are flying into Rome, I highly recommend you take advantage of this service. , It helped to have somebody take us to the Via dei Tre Archi as it is a small alley off the Via dei Coronari. Once we knew how to get there we had no problem finding our way back during the rest of our stay. I suggest packing light, trying to fit all your needs into carry-on sized luggage or perhaps backpacks as there is no elevator. You have to carry the luggage up the first flight of stairs to the office to check in. Then there is a fairly tight spiral staircase leading to the floors. We did not need assistance with our luggage but other reviewers mentioned how the staff had helped them with theirs. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There is someone around 24/7, but not necessarily sitting at the reception desk especially late at night or early in the morning. They respond quickly to the table bell on the desk. As is common at small hotels in Europe you have to leave your keys at the desk when heading out, and there is always staff around to buzz you in at the main door upon your return. We stayed at #24, a double bedroom one floor up from the reception and breakfast areas. The rooms including the bathroom were quite large by European hotel standards especially given the type of building (i.e. not new construction). The beds were comfortable. The bathroom had a heated towel rack. The window of the main bedroom opened out onto Via dei Coronari. We spent most of the day out of the hotel so the view was not critical. It got a little noisy down on the street Saturday night - not entirely unexpected - but the other nights were quiet. Our was the lowest floor for the hotel rooms and it would probably be quieter on the higher floors. Perhaps the best feature of the hotel was its location. The Piazza Navona is almost at the front door. The Pantheon was a short hop from there. The Trevi Fountain, in turn, was not not much farther east from the Pantheon. South from the Pantheon was the Capitol Hill overlooking the Roman Forum and the Colosseum. Northwest of Residenza Canali, across the Tiber River, was the Vatican. The Spanish Steps are a comfortable stroll away. If you need motorized transportation there is a taxi stand nearby at the north end of Piazza Navona at the Piazza Tor Sanguigna. There are also several bus routes stopping at the same spot. Unfortunately the nearest Metro underground station is Spagna, at the Spanish Steps. The breakfast service was very good with cold cuts, cheese, bread, pastries, yoghurt, fresh fruit, cereal, pie, and freshly-brewed coffee; the staff will brew expresso or cappuccino per request. There are countless dining options in the area, from the restaurants lining Piazza Navona and the Pantheon to the numerous cafes, osteria, trattoria and ristorante scattered along both main roads and tiny side streets. Be sure to do your research ahead of time or ask the staff for recommendations prior to getting into town. On the other hand you could leave it to serendipity and drop in on any establishment that looks interesting and perhaps make your own pleasant discovery. Residenza Canali ai Coronari can only enhance your experience in Rome.

This small hotel looks nothing from the outside, tucked away in a side street, but the bedrooms have everything you would need, including TV, fridge, very well stocked tea/coffee tray (in fact the best selection of teas that I have ever seen in any hotel), napkins, and a real bottle opener (not just the cheap version). The rooms vary in as much not all are air conditioned nor have a balcony/terrace, (we had one of each style) but that is only to be expected given the lay out of the accommodation - just a few rooms on each floor off a spiral staircase; however, each of the rooms that we had was more than adequate in size, with spacious and well equipped bathroom. You do need to be fairly fit to cope with the staircase and your luggage, although reception is always manned and so someone can normally assist if necessary with the luggage; both reception and the breakfast room are situated on the first floor with bedrooms allocated on a further 3 floors. Access to the hotel is by pressing the buzzer on the outside wall of the side street, and the door opens leading to the spiral staircase. There is a small breakfast room which provides typical adequate choice for a self-service continental breakfast: orange juice, tea, fresh fruit, yoghurts, selection of individual cereals, cheese and meats, rolls and selection of packaged savoury biscuits, and of course, croissants, pastries and cake. There is always someone on hand to offer cappuccinos or espressos. Staff at the hotel are friendly and helpful, and speak good English. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Castel St. Angelo, the Vatican, The Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, in fact most of the main tourist attractions although we did take the open top tour bus eventually as we only had 2 days in Rome and tried to see as much as possible without total exhaustion! There are numerous small bars around the hotel, as well as interesting individual small shops plus restaurants/cafes galore, many frequented by the locals. We enjoyed wonderful food, atmosphere and plenty of Prosecco, all reasonably priced, in around the side streets within walking distance of the hotel. Tips: we were told at the airport that taxi from the airport is a set charge of 30 Euros, however, our taxi driver told us that was to the centre, and not to our hotel; our final charge was 47 Euros although to our mind the hotel is very central indeed! The return journey by taxi, booked via the hotel, was only 35 Euros. If planning on walking around Rome you definitely need extremely comfortable, deep soled, foot attire as most of the streets are sets or cobbled and hard going on the feet! Overall impression: whilst the hotel is not fancy, more like an extremely good B&B, I would recommend it strongly and would certainly stay there again as and when I return to Rome.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cork", "Title": "\u201cComfortbable, clean, convenient\u201d", "Author": "Espedair", "ReviewID": "UR126985580", "Content": "This lovely, small and very friendly hotel is well situated, only a few minutes from Piazza Navona, but in a quiet area.

I honestly think the comfort of the bed is THE most important thing in a hotel, so...maybe it's time to replace the mattresses and make the rooms comfy? - The bedding coverlet and blanket really need to be replaced. They look and feel like they are 100% polyester from the 1970's. This would be so easy to update and would make such a difference in the comfort of the room!

Some close friends passionately recommended Residenza Canali, both for its fabulous location at Piazza Navona and for the exquisite service at this modest boutique hotel. How right they were. First, it must be noted that the hotel has no elevator, which is very important for anyone has trouble walking up stairs. The hotel lobby is a flight above ground level, so you have to take stairs. The same goes to get to your room on a winding staircase. If you have no trouble with stairs, then this leads me to a very important recommendation: have the hotel reserve a driver to pick you up. This is not only to avoid the long cab lines at the airport, but also because the driver will bring in your luggage and help the staff carry it up to your room. We arrived in Rome early in the morning from an overnight flight from Washington, DC. The driver was a welcome sight, and gave us a min-tour coming into the city. We arrived at the hotel too early for our rooms to be ready, so we registered and left our luggage to the hotel and driver\u2019s care, and then headed out to a caf\u00e9 our friends recommended for the best cappuccino in Rome (Sant\u2019Eustachio il caff\u00e9). This was another terrific recommendation, although we had cappuccino elsewhere and never had any that was less than very good. After touring Santa Maria sopra Minerva (The Basilica of Saint Mary Above Minerva) and then the Pantheon, we headed back to the hotel. Our rooms were ready, and they were fantastic. There are just two rooms on the top floor, each with a private terrace. The views are fantastic and what a wonderful place to lounge. We used the terrace in the morning with coffee, in the late afternoons with wine and cheese and in the evenings after dinner for a glass of wine. Naturally, the rooms with terraces cost more than the other rooms, but if you can afford it, get it! This enhanced our stay more than I can express. Nevertheless, if you can\u2019t afford or reserve one of these rooms, don\u2019t let this stop you. Stay at this quaint hotel anyway. There\u2019s a small dining room where you have a free breakfast (pastries, breakfast meats, cereal, yogurt, fruit, etc.). There\u2019s coffee (\u201cAmerican coffee, they call it) and tea, but don\u2019t dip into that the coffee that quickly, because the staff will come in and ask you if you want a cappuccino or espresso (no extra charge). If you want ice for your room, just ask for it at the front desk. We had a mini fridge in our room, but I don\u2019t know if they have one in every room. There\u2019s also free wifi in the rooms, and for those of you who travel with a computer, there\u2019s one that you can use for free in the lobby. There\u2019s a nice convenience store just down the narrow street, where you can buy wine, water, snacks, food and sundries, plus it has a deli. This was very convenient. There are terrific restaurants within very easy walking distance. Plus, there\u2019s a taxi stand in the plaza by the hotel. When it was time to check out, the staff was very helpful in helping us carry down our luggage (the driver, who wasn\u2019t the one who drove us there, wasn\u2019t walking up that spiral staircase!). The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times, and helped make this a memorable experience.

Boy was I glad I did as I found the most lovely bed and breakfast we could have imagined. Everything that everyone is saying is true. During our stay we met all the staff Stefano, Antonio, Mario and Paolo, I emailed Francesca while arranging our stay but never met her! They were all fantastic and so helpful. We felt so at home there. Our friends didnt get the terrace room the first night due to a mix up and the next day their bags were moved and a beautiful bottle of wine awaited them also with a room discount!!! We stayed for two nights before our cruise and then at the end of our vacation stayed another night before leaving beautiful Italy. Stefano offered to make reservations for us at Santa Lucia the restaurant around the corner under the trees (Eat Pray Love) which we should have accepted but waited to long and couldnt get a reservation until 9:30 so we ended up eating at Piazza Navona which really was the best way to end our trip to Italy with the ambience, music, people, fountains aaaah!!!

Breakfast was available each morning in a small cosy room within the hotel, the time we went it was relatively quiet so managed to get a seat no problem and there was plenty of choice and staff were well on top of things to ensure there were no shortages. We were able to leave our bags with them after we checked out as our flight home wasn't until the evening and they let us use their facilities to freshen up before we left. The location of the hotel is perfect in the centre of Roma, you are close to Piazza Navona without literally being on top of it.

Here is why: Residenza Canali hotel is always consistent, is an absolutely lovely, impecably clean hotel, and the staff and owners have always gone well out of their way to provide stellar customer service with that real Italian warmth and congeniality, all at a fair price. I have never experienced any lack of cleanliness or insufficient air-conditioning as one person wrote. I started staying there over 10 years ago and have traveled every city and region in Italy. I prefer small, private, intimate hotels with a 4 star rating, like the Residenza Canali because you have all the services of a big hotel, in a well-appointed, lovely atmosphere as well as a home-like touch. ( I even go to breakfast in my slippers sometimes). The food is much better quality than the big hotels. As a trained pastry chef, I really appreciate the aroma of warm FRESH baked goods wafting out of the breakfast room and the tantalizing perfume of espresso or cappucino. American/English coffee is always available too, but then why am I in Italy if I don't drink their coffee as well as their culture? The location really is fabulous. It is literally a few steps from Piazza Navona and a close walk to many major attractions, such as the Pantheon, St. Peters, Sistine Chapel, and theTrevi Fountain. Though it is in the heart of the city, it is situated on a very quaint small back street which is alway quiet and gives you the feeling of being in small town Italy. You have access to everything you need in the immediate vicinity. There is a pharmacy, a taxi stand, city tourist information & bus stops practically right out your front door. Of course numerous shops, gelaterias, resturants, and a nearby grocery store go without saying. Indeed the best bakery in Rome is located again a few steps from the hotel. I usually have them pack up a Kilo of Italian cookies for the plane and delight my friends and family when I return home. Then, one of the best Wine shops (Enoteca) in Rome is located in Piazza Cavour, about 15 minutes walk. As a wine professional I can tell you they have the best selection of wines in Rome. I once counted 52 different producers of Brunello di Montalcino. The staff can direct you to the store. Residenza Canali has always gone out of their way to help me navigate the city with trains, busses, etc. They have even helped me make phone calls to old Italian relatives who spoke mostly dialects, and acted as translators for me. About 5 years ago, they even arranged for a wheelchair for me to bring my elderly, handicapped mother with me. None of the other hotels in other cities would help me out. The most incredible act occured this Septmber when my cell phone was not working properly in Italy , though it had worked well many times in the past. All my business contacts and family members could not reach me. I was desperate and embarrassed. Though I tried everything, all the special chips and phone cards were not working. I was panicked because I made an error and had missed my train which was taking me to a rental car location where I was to pick up a car to drive to a relative's wedding. The rental car office was closing for the weekend. Stefano, a long time employee at Residenza Canali, telephoned the office, explained my situation and coaxed them into opening up the store for me when I was able to make the next train. The office manager of the car rental office had to make special arrangements because she was at a funeral, so I really needed communication, both to pick up my car and to keep in contact with my relatives waiting for me at the other end. After all these problems, I was in danger of missing the last train going to my relatives. Stefano literally ran with me to a couple of stores nearby to try to buy an Italian phone for me at an economical price. After no luck, he offered me his own personal phone with the understanding that I would return it to him the next year. In addition, he was able to contact a car to bring my husband and I and our 150 overstuffed bags of luggage to the train station. I was able to finally get in touch with all my personal and business contacts, to pick up my car during off hours and not miss my cousin's wedding. I was in awe that Stefano went beyond the call of duty in his customer service efforts to be sure I got to my car, and the wedding, as well as reinstating my communication for me. It was as though he had a personal stake in my misadventures.

(3) A/C - the air conditioning worked great in both rooms which was a plus because Rome had a heat wave when we were there and it also helped with the noise from the street while sleeping. Cons - (1) Mold growing all along the grout in the bathtub and up the walls. We complained and they said they would come clean it but never did. This is such a simple fix and would have made so much difference in our feel for the place. (2) Breakfast - the worst of all our hotels on the trip (we stayed in 5 hotels throughout in Italy on this trip). The tiny room has about 8-10 small tables and a \"buffet\" offering boxed cereals, yogurts, some rolls/meat/cheeses, the coffee was the worst coffee we have EVER tasted, thankfully we could get weak cappaccinos but the coffee tasted like dirt - literally.

A couple of things to note - our room window faced via di Coronary and it was a little noisy at nights. It wasn't a big issue for us as we were so tired and slept very well. Also closing the window eliminated the noise, but at the expense of fresh air.

It is seconds away from great restaurants (there is one right around the corner on Tre Archi which I highly reccommend).

This was our second stay at this small hotel (ten rooms) and again we had a great experience. Room 42 consists of one average-sized king bedroom, a modern, pretty bath, and a surprisingly large terrace (about 10X12 feet, estimate) with a table, two chairs and potted plants along the ledge. Can't say the view from the terrace was attractive (residential rooftops), but we had our own private, pleasant happy hours there with wine, bread and olives purchased at a wonderful little grocery steps down the Via Coronari. There is a small refrigerator in the room. Residenza Canali is located along the Via Coronari, a quiet, pretty, historic street of antique shops less than one block from (and pleasantly removed from) the noisy Piazza Navona. This is a lovely, safe area in Rome. One can walk to the Pantheon in less than five minutes, Castel San Angelo in ten, the Vatican in twenty minutes. The buses along Via Zanardelli, a block away, take you to the Forum, the Coloseum, Termini, etc. in just minutes You can purchase multi-day bus/metro passes at the tobacco shop at the corner of V. Coronari and V. Zanardelli . (FYI, a bus inspector checked passengers' tickets on one of our trips, and I believe there is a hefty fine if one doesn't have a ticket). The front desk is staffed by the famous Stefano and Francesca, who are very professional and detail-oriented and have a can-do attitude. They will help you with any need, but the rooms are so comfortable and thoughtfully provisioned, you will likely not need anything other than recommendations for restaurants and such. Cleanliness, nice fabrics, unobtrusive maid service, a lovely breakfast, great location, free internet computer in the lobby, no noise from other rooms, no odors, and proximity to good restaurants made this a perfect choice for us. The hotel has an arrangement with a private limo service to transport you to the airport, no matter how early, for 40 Euros (or 50, can't remember which)...we had a very pleasant young man as our driver. As for negatives, the stairs and the small shower are all I can think of. There is a wonderful family-owned small restaurant next door to the hotel, the Ristorante Tre Archi di Loneti. Mr. Loneti is the owner and server. We ate three dinners there (and had on our previous trip to Rome also). The eggplant parmigiana and spinach were wonderful; I looked forward to them all day! The house wine is very good and all prices are reasonable...probably about 45 Euros for two dinners with wine/beer.

That was 20 euros for 4 of us. We later found out that they charge for the bread as a cover charge because you are sitting down at a table. We tried to tell them that we didn't want bread once, to take it away, and we were told we had to take it if we wanted to sit down and eat. Also, if you order fish, make sure what you are paying for.

Stefano was wonderful and greeted us at the door at our arrival, and helped us with our luggage up the stairs. As others have mentioned, there is no elevator, but we had no problem managing our luggage, especially with the help of Stefano! Room #2 was wonderful!!!!

Breakfast was a typical Italian breakfast with croissants, meats, cheeses, etc. But there were also cereals and fresh fruit, and my husband and I were both able to find plenty to eat at breakfast. The last thing I want to mention is the location, it was perfect! We walked everywhere, never had to take public transportation, and the walk was never too far. I think ancient Rome was the furthest, and that was probably only a 20 minute walk.

Agree with everyone on the following - - wonderful wonderful location - a block off of Piazza Navona, a quick walk to the Vatican, easy access to Trevi/Pantheon etc - the street (Coronari) is chock full of interesting shops - antiques, jewelrey, posters/paintings, awsome coffee bars and a few decent restaurants - the street is marked \"area pedonale\" (supposed to be pedestrian only) - ha! many mopeds, cars and even trucks totally ignore this! - once inside the stairs are steep - the hosts were more than accomodating with offering to haul our luggage up for us - we declined as we were fine but know that they are willing - breakfast was quite fine - I liked the addition of protein (there was always a meat and cheese tray out) and my husband enjoyed the cakes/tarts - agree with the person who commented on the lack of cappucino/espresso - however we found a number of fabulous coffee bars on via Coronari and who can complain about 2E worth of coffee (0.90 for husband's espresso and 1.10E for my cappuccino - I just about cried when I think about what the same order costs us at Starbucks!) On our first stay we had room 3 - it is very small but was perfectly fine for us as we were essentially just sleeping there - we slept with the window open but there is lots and lots of street noise - unbelieveably noisy pedestrians until the wee hours of the morning, and then the seagulls start! - we're not overly fussy sleepers so while irritating and enough to cause us to wake up every few hours it wasn't life altering - could be for fussy sleepers though - the bathroom was a bit dated and was not spotless, in my opinion - it was definitely surface clean and nothing horrific but I'm fussy and when my eyes wandered to corners of the floor or the edge of the shower, it just wasn't spotless - my husband, who is not fussy, didn't notice and didn't care - it wasn't enough to ruin anything but it was just there - this was a small shower room but this being our third trip to Europe staying in similar class hotels this has ceased to faze us - while perfectly adequate this was not my favourite room of the trip however, all of the other things (LOCATION!!! and being on such an awesome street and everyone being quite friendly) overcame this issue in my opinion On our return we were assigned Room D: - what a difference! This room (as described in a previous review) had an anteroom with a single bed and a bedroom with a larger bed - the bathroom was much larger with a tub shower! (after 16 days this was enough for a dance of joy - the space!) - this bathroom was much more modern than room 3 and this time was definitely spotlessly clean (I hate the subliminal impulse that starts my eyes wandering where maybe you just don't need to see things, you know?? :) ) - as the previous poster mentioned, we also slept with all of the windows closed except the bathroom to allow for air flow and this worked just fine - during the day with the windows open the street noise was quite loud (I can't even imagine what hotels on main streets must be like if this was an \"area pedonale\"!) - we didn't wake up at all with this arrangement - I liked this room much much better and this improved my overall outlook of this hotel - that's the rub with B&Bs/Palazzo's/Residenza's (in my opinion), they are lovely, authentic, quaint and not a generic Sheraton or Westin and a great way to meet other people but not all the rooms are the same and it can sometimes make or break your experience!

All considered, we were satisfied with our choice. The small staff makes a real difference. They are eager to meet any need or answer any question -- notably Stefano, star receptionist and, in our experience, the heart of the hotel...er, bed-and-breakfast. Our first room, Room C, was for three nights. It was on the third floor -- second floor in European terms. It had a tiny anteroom, tiny bedroom, tiny bathroom and shower and one large window, on Via Coronari. Note well: Via Coronari is touted as a \"pedestrian\" street, but it has light car and Vespa (moped) traffic day and night. You will hear that, as well as the loud conversations of passersby, if you are a light sleeper. Fortunately, it was cool enough to close the window at night and be comfortable. Closed, the windows block out noise well. There is air-conditioning and heating, but neither was in season in the time we stayed. Then we were moved to Room D across the hall. It had a larger anteroom, larger bedroom, larger bathroom. Best of all, the bathroom window could be left open at night, allowing the bedroom and anteroom windows to be closed. Bliss. Slept right through. The shower was in the bathtub, and worked great. In fact, the Canali's modern bathrooms get an \"A\" from us for cleanliness and function. The breakfast room was small and just adequately lighted, but the breakfast itself was good enough to satisfy us for the entire stay without getting bored. A decent selection and quite fresh. We found that most other guests during our stay were foreign -- English, Dutch, French, etc. -- with only a few Americans. The Canali is not in any sense a luxury hotel.

All rooms have a safe and had tea/coffee making facilities which was an unexpected bonus. My room had a terrace with table and chairs but with a very limited view of rooftops. The breakfast is typically Italian (breads, cheeses, cold meats, yoghurt, cereals, cake, fruit, orange juice and tea/coffee) but of excellent quality and plentiful.

Their breakfast was the best of our trip with delicious dark coffee, bakery items, fruit, and meat every morning. The only shabby part of the place is the terrace. They could do a lot to spruce that area up, like clean it. But we did not use the terrace that much b/c of the heat and the mosquitos. Many, many good restaurants within easy walking distance and of course the Piazza Novona is just a stone's throw away so you can stroll in the evening with your gelato or go browse around for that \"genuine\" Prada handbag for 10 euros. They have no elevator and no computer to print out boarding passes. There is a handy taxi stand 1 block away. Lastly, they have a driver service to the airport which we used. I found him impatient and he does not have enough seat belts for 4 people despite me asking specifically about this issue before we booked. I would not use him again. He charges the same as a taxi (actually 5 euros more) and unless you need his big trunk for lots of luggage I just do not see any advantage. Plenty of taxis have adequate seat belts for 4. Since I do not know where else to post a review of tours I will say one thing abaout tours here. We booked a day trip to Pompeii with Context Rome that was spectacular. I highly recommend them.

It is very small and has about a 2 inch by 2 inch sign (which we thought was so cool). It's so conveniently located to just about everything. I couldn't have asked for a better location and Piazza Navona is always alive, so even if you don't feel like going very far there is something to do.

With the terrace doors closed it was a very quiet room, although we enjoyed taking naps with the door open as it let the breeze in. The bathroom was very big and clean, the bed comfortable and the mini bar stocked. The stairs were a great workout & only inconvenient at check in and check out, but worth it. I can't really comment on the breakfast as we were rarely up at breakfast time. Dang time difference was hard to get used to. I can say that Stefano was AWESOME!

Based on the TripAdvisor reviews, Residenza Canali appeared to fit my requirements for a clean, very quiet hotel less than 200 euro/night. I was very nervous, however, because both my partner and I are very sensitive to noise at night and the hotel is in a very central location; just around the corner from Piazza Novona. Also, even though most of the reviews said the hotel was quiet, there were a few people who mentioned they were bothered by noise--- if anyone was going to be bothered by noise, it would be us, so we emailed the hotel and requested a quiet room. We had the hotel arrange pick-up from the airport - very convenient and 45 euro (taking the train is also an option). We were given room #2 which was on the top floor. I was very pleasantly surprised w/ the room - the room was an average size for a room in Rome but the bathroom and balcony were large (i think only rooms 1 and 2 have balconies). Everything was very clean - this is not a 4 star hotel, so it is not super-luxurious but they are charging at least 100 euro a night less than a 4 star and I believe the trade off is well worth it. What we liked about the hotel: - Friendly staff. - Clean. - Quiet - at least our room was exceptionally quiet. - Convenient location. Things you may want to consider (none of these bothered us but they may be a problem for some) - There is no elevator and the stairs are a bit steep for someone who has problems walking (I enjoyed using the stairs but it is not for everyone) - The breakfast was fairly basic (though the same as other comparably priced hotels) and the breakfast room was a bit cramped. Again this was fine with us as there are many places to get espresso/pastries within a few blocks. - Our bathroom was very nicely done and modern; however, the shower (no tub) may be a bit confining for a larger person.

Residenza Canali made it even more special. I booked directly with Resi. Canali, I think the personal touch goes a long way. It's so difficult to choose a hotel, even more so when it's for someone else, so I often find a telephone call helps me decide. It was lovely to speak to Stefano who also kindly arranged a taxi pick-up, Euro 90 for 3 and their cases return Ciampino-Hotel-Ciampino. We had originally booked 2 twin rooms but a few days before departure a friend had to pull out because of an illness. I made a phonecall to Canali to explain my problem and they solved it without hesitation and with no extra charge. My mum changed to a single room, euro 115 when paid in cash. Euro 135 (cash) for the twin. So off they went! They had a fabulous time! The rooms were clean, warm and quiet. Breakfast met their expectations, the girls love their cakes and fruit! The stairs could have been a problem but they are all fairly fit. You need to appreciate that not all buildings in Rome have lifts. Besides, stairs are good for your health! Location - I had previously stayed in an apartment on Coronari so I knew the location would be safe for them and central. They walked everywhere. It really is an excellent price for such a prime location! The airport pick up was efficient and friendly. Mum said that all the staff were very kind and attentive.

(We chose to pay in cash and got a discount.) The location was wonderful, of course, right by Piazza Navona, and I loved wandering up and down via Coronari, with all its antique shops. (But other hotels are equally centrally located.) And I already knew our room was on the top floor, with no elevator, so that wasn't an issue (we never use hotel elevators anyway). Stephano, at the front desk most evenings, was very kind and helpful, even more so than the other staff, who were all accommodating. Our room, #2 at the top, with a little terrace, was nice, though not as spacious as the pictures make it out to be. The terrace was a great feature, but we didn't use it as much as I thought we would, as we ended up preferring to sit and people-watch on Piazza Navona. (That's a comment on our preferences; for someone who likes terraces in their rooms, the room would be wonderful.) This was the only hotel we stayed at in Italy that had a hot water pot in the room for making tea, which was great. My biggest disappointment was in the breakfast, which many reviewers said was great. I found the food the same as at many places; I only ever have a cornetto and maybe some fruit, and there offerings in those departments were fine. The breakfast room itself was cramped and felt windowless (I can't remember if there were windows or not). But no cappucino! (Regular coffee, tea and juice were offered.) That really bothered me. After the first morning, we skipped breakfast at the hotel, and instead went to Bar Mariotto, just at the entrance to Piazza Navona. There, we could sit outside with a view onto Piazza Navona, with a delicious cup of cappucino (including a dusting of chocolate in the bottom of the cup prior to adding the espresso - very nice touch) and a cornetto for about 3.50 Euros total for two people. Bottom line, if you want a terrace and coffee or tea with breakfast, this place would be great. I would probably stay here again, despite the hotel's breakfast, because I'd rather have breakfast near Piazza Navona anyway. And as an aside, if you're a runner, this hotel has a GREAT location, because you can run, basically, straight down via Coronari and run along the river in either direction, or run across Ponte Sant'Angelo and around the Castel Sant'Angelo, or even to St. Peter's.

I made all reservations by internet/email.I also enjoyed reading Rick Steves tour info out loud as we toured. He has our kind of sense of humor. We also had a book entitled, Italy with Kids, that was a big help. One of this book\u2019s suggestions was to pack once then take out one third of what we packed. We decided to go even lighter as an experiment. I highly recommend packing very light. No one cares that you wore the same thing over and over, but getting around by plane and train was much easier. So was unpacking and repacking at each hotel. We also didn\u2019t have room to carry souvenirs so we were very choosy. Four my family of four we had a carry on size bag for my girls, plus one backpack of light weight toys/books, and for us we had a medium suitcase plus one Rick Steves day pack (loved it). For an example of what we packed, I packed on jeans, one dress slacks, one dressy sweater, and two long sleeve shirts, and one pair of dressy flat shoes. I wore one jeans and shirt, well broken in black shoes (Landsend all weather leather mocs). All my shirts were similar color so I used one scarf to dress them up. I brought the dress pants and shoes for the Vatican, but found that jeans/casual shoes would have been fine. I never wore them again. We paid to have our laundry done at Hotel Pasquale in Cinque Terre. My parents packed one carry-on size bag and one Rick Steves daypack. They didn\u2019t do any laundry on the way, but my mom hand washed a couple of things. I will never pack heavy again! We zipped on and off of trains and up and down hotel stairs, my smallest daughter didn\u2019t have to carry or pull anything, and we could easily count and keep track of every piece. Grand total, 6 people, three small suitcases and three half-filled backpacks! Here are my recommendations: Rome. We stayed in Hotel Residenza Canali. It was small but very nice, warm in each room and the breakfasts were good. Nothing hot like eggs, but the variety and quantity was very good. There is no elevator and we were on several flights up. This is just a caution not a negative. The staff was very helpful, calling taxis, giving directions, advice. I really enjoyed the stay. It is located very close to Piazza Navona which is very centrally located. We had a family room for the four of us and my parents had a double. Our room was very spacious, but my parents was a little tighter. Both were well furnished and very clean. The restaurant they recommend right next door was very good and I recommend it. The weather was mostly cloudy and rainy one day. We had fall jackets and hats and scarves to be safe. Some days warmed up and we carried our jackets. Overall we were very fortunate with the weather. November weather is hit or miss, but the lack of crowds and draining heat make up for the chill or drizzle. I recommend November and it\u2019s low season prices. We did mostly walking, averaging 8-10 miles per day according to my Mom\u2019s pedometer. This doesn\u2019t give extra credit for stairs, but made it fun to keep trekking. We walked to the Vatican, which takes 30 minutes at a leisurely pace. The taxi ride is 5-10 minutes. We enjoyed the Papal audience (arrive very early). We sat to the right of the alter which still had front row seats when the center seats will filled all the way back. The seats on the right aren\u2019t visible from the door, so they are easily overlooked. We really hit the jackpot we thought. We had plenty of time to wander around and look at the statues while one of us held our seats. We returned the following day to tour the Vatican. Definitely go up to the top of St. Peter\u2019s! In Rome we also enjoyed the Coliseum and Forum, Castelo Angelo, Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon, and the churches. We were always shocked at the beauty inside a church that didn\u2019t look that great from the outside. We left by train to go to Cinque Terre. We bought tickets at the train station, not in advance. I recommend 1st class if you can afford it and are taking a long trip. The price difference is not big but the seating is better and there is a snack car. Cinque Terre was a wonderful place. Don\u2019t miss it or even make a special tirp just to go there some time. The weather was warm, upper 60s which allowed for no jackets most of the time. The walking is strenuous but the trails are huge fun and beautiful views. The kids LOVED it. They played on the beach one morning in their bathing suits for almost two hours! We stayed at Hotel Pasquale in Monterosso, which was a short, and pretty walk from the train station. Turn left outside the train and walk up the hill and through the tunnel. The hotel is on the other side. We again had a family room and my parents had a double. Both rooms had a beautiful view of the beach. The breakfast was delicious with a good variety. There were hard boiled eggs but no hot eggs or hot meats. Still very good. The low season rate was a steal for what we got I thought. Service was wonderful. They had a pay as you use internet to check email or transfer money. Again, no elevator. The shopping is mostly closed in November but that leaves more time for walking the trails between the five villages. We also used the train in between the villages. Don\u2019t let the trail descriptions keep you away from walking. The walks are lots fo up hill and and little stairs, but take it at your pace and enjoy. In the off-season the trails are not crowded so you can take your time. I can\u2019t recommend Cinque Terre in the off-season more highly. It was paradise. We left by train for Venice. Venice was much colder and we ended up buying hats and gloves for those without. We were lucky to not suffer through any floods. We stayed at the Hotel Mercurio using their November internet offer. We had to get a separate room for the girls, but they loved it. At the low season rate, the extra room was not more than we had paid for family rooms at the other hotels. The rooms were very simple very clean and comfortable. No elevator again. Breakfast was varied and delicious, but no hot dishes. The hotel was very centrally located. Next door was dinner restaurant that had the best liver and onions I will ever have. Liver and onions is a Venice specialty. The service was snobby but the liver and onions were worth it. It\u2019s hard to resist shopping in Venice! Fortunately the shops close at 7PM or earlier in the off-season. The bad part is that you\u2019ll spend more sight-seeing time to shop since you can\u2019t shop in the evening. We enjoyed the bell tower, St Mark\u2019s Square and Cathedral. The rest of the time we wandered the alleys to find sights we found in tour books. We took the tour arranged by our hotel to the glass factory in Murano. The water taxi was a blast, a highlight especially since it was free. We did end up buying something at the factory show room but it was not a really hard sell. If you are not in spirit to buy expensive glass then either skip Murano or go out on your own, not on an arranged tour. However, my favorite part was Burano Island to see lace making. Don\u2019t miss the museum. Also, buy a piece of history that will soon be extinct, lace, if you can afford it. Be sure it is hand made lace. We like the shop called \u201cOlga\u201d which was near the museum. Yes, lace is very expensive, but it is art & crafts at is absolute finest and will soon disappear all together. Burano was lovely with it\u2019s canal and colorful houses. We have lots of beautiful pictures. We took the waterbus back. We used the waterbus to go to the airport, but we should have taken the water taxi. For a large group like ours the cost was not much more and it would have been much faster and less noisy. Italy was great for kids. Plenty to see and do. Lots of things to climb on. The kids were missing school and each had to write a report when they returned. They carried a notebook and kept a journal each day. It was a good way to pass time at a restaurant or on the train. I also bought credit card size games for everyone. We had Yahtzee, Boogle, Connect Four, Battleship, Uno, and Hangman. Everyone enjoyed these and they were always handy on our pockets. Also, before your take your kids to Venice have them read \u201cThe Thief Lord\u201d by Cornelia Funke, which is set in Venice. For adults, before you go to Rome and the Vatican read \u201cThe Pope and His Ceiling\u201d by Ross King about Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel. It opens up a whole new perspective. I just read Ross King\u2019s \u201cBrunelleschi\u2019s Dome\u201d about the great Santa Maria del Fiore\u2019s dome in Florence.

We have recently come back from Rome, and I have to say we had a fabulous time. The hotel in my mind was perfect, situated in the old town, surrounded by cobbled streets and antique shops. The staff were helpful and friendly. Breakfast was served 7.30-10.00 and there was a good selection too. We stayed on the first floor, which you reached via a winding staircase - for some reason they still had a christmas tree by the stairs!! which we found amusing. The rooms were of good size, clean with a daily maid service. You could not fault the location of this hotel, it was excellent. All the main attractions are easily within walking distance, to give you an idea, the Piazza Navona is literally minutes, if you continue through the Piazza Navona and turn left you will shortly reach the Pantheon, to the right of the Pantheon there is a delicatessen (in a very pretty yellow building) try the twisted pizzas they are superb and cheap!!! The Trevi Fountain and Spanish Steps were about 10 mins away from the hotel, similarly St Peters and the Vatican were also 10 mins. The coliseum was the furthest away at approx 25 mins. Rome is quite pricey even heading off down a side street away from the main attractions to find a little cafe or bar, prices still seemed to be dear, but this should not stop you from having a great time. The Via del Corso is heaven for anyone that loves shopping!! Italy apparently have 2 sales a year February they sell off the winter stocks and September they sell off the summer stocks - and boy there are designers bargains to be had!!! We had a great time and I would definitely return to the Residenza Canali, I do not think you could get a more reasonably priced hotel so centrally located to everything!

The central marble staircase is incredibly noisy as there are no doors in the stairwell for blocking the sound as people tromp up and down stairs at all hours. Also, the walls are paper thin so you get intimately familiar with the bathroom habits of those next to you. I could also hear water running through the pipes in the ceiling. The breakfast was very good. The receive fresh baked bread and pastries every morning from a nearby bakery. One morning, the hearty bread was still so hot from the oven that it melted the butter I put on it. They were able to give us a few good restaurant recommendations and arranged a large car for 5 of us plus luggage to pick us up at 4:30am to go to the airport on New Years Day. The rooms were minimal, failry clean and the bathrooms were good except that we had ants in our bathroom one morning. The didn't reappear the next morning though.

I had a few special requests in advance of the stay and while in Rome and the staff handled everything quickly and cheerfully. The breakfasts were memorable (I loved the elegant presentation and attention to detail given to the place settings), but the best part about the place are the very nice and helpful staff. My room was simply but nicely decorated and small, but not cramped. There was a bit of noise from the lively Via de Coronari in the evenings, but the sound-resistant windows blocked most noise quite effectively. Noise should be a problem only for the most sensitive of people; if that is likely to be a concern, request a room in the back. The usual toiletries and hair dryer were provided. I required an outlet adaptor for my American plugs. The location near Piazza Navona is also wonderful (especially during the Christmas season when there is a market). Via de Coronari is a great alley for strolling and window-shopping and very active in the early evenings. The hotel is very near the Vatican and Pantheon. I like the this area much better than the area immediately around the Vatican, which feels more touristy and is really dead in the evenings. Most things are within a walkable distance, but I recommend asking the staff about buses. The nearby 81 and 87 are very easy to take and handy to the forum area and Southeast. I found that it worked well to ride out in the morning and work our way back to the hotel on foot. The Residenza is small and does not provide the extra facilities of large hotels such as a currency exchange (but it makes more sense to use ATMs), business center, fitness center, restaurant, etc. If you need something in particular, ask in advance. The only thing I might have liked would have been an internet station. If you prefer large lobbies, anonymity and the predictability of large hotels (or require some of those facilities), this is not the place for you. If do you stay here, I recommend using hotel-arranged transportation from the hotel. The price seems about the same as a taxi and they will be able to find the hotel. Make sure to have cash ready to pay the driver (I wish the hotel would pay them and add the charge to the bill). Bottom line: this is a great choice if you want 5-star quality for less money and prefer a small place over a large hotel.", "Date": "January 6, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cA Kiss\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR2848148", "Content": "Residenza Canali is the most beautiful hotel in the world", "Date": "November 26, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Residenza Canali ai Coronari", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d488889-Reviews-Residenza_Canali_ai_Coronari-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$174 - $321*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via dei Tre Archi 13</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00186</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "488889", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ff/8e/ff8e7dcec25652c0d89a91642d384f6f1large.jpg"}}
