After circling all over the place in the dark, we broke a few traffic laws and got in. The breakfast was a disaster, having run out of even the most basic foods, like coffee, oatmeal, toast, yogurt. There was no attendant in the breakfast room, and no one at the front desk. We had no time to go searching for a restaurant, as we had to get to our workplace. Strangest of all was that there was extremely hot water in the toilet, running constantly, and creating steam and stuffiness in the whole room! We've never had that happen before in a hotel, or anywhere, for that matter. The walls were thin, and we could hear our neighbor's TV and banging around in the kitchenette.
