And the rates can make this an exceptional value. I stayed from Nov. 1-6. But note: I was given what apparently was an extremely low rate (by a wonderful, extremely helpful day clerk, whose name I think was something like Giorgio) when I walked in off the street seeking a room for 5 nights. But when I inquired of a different clerk who happened to be staffing the desk another day, about the rate for a room for my wife, who would be looking for a room just as I would be departing, I was initially quoted a much higher rate -- 180 euro for the first night, and 150 for subsequent nights -- than the one I was paying. Later, when Giorgio returned, he agreed to give my wife the same very low rate as I had. So although tte rates presumably vary according to the time of the year and how booked they are, they also apparently vary (at least when you're talking to them in person) accordng to who you deal with, and it may be advisable to try and negotiate a bit. I was in room 301, and had no problems with noise (but maybe that's partially attributable to being generally insensitive to modest street noise). During the day -- but not night -- there are church bells which sound regularly, but I found those to be charming, rather than a shortcoming.

We were very pleased with our stay. Much has already been said about the Hotel\u2019s Location. Via dei Gabrielli is actually a very tiny, inclined street, just off Via dei Coronari. The Hotel is 10-15 steps up on Via Gabrielli. You know you\u2019ve reached when you reach the Square with the San Salvatore Lauro Church, the Hotel is a very, very little bit to the right, with your back to the Church Square. The Hotel is about 3 \u2013 4 minutes walking from Piazza Navona (take the third small lane to the right, after making a right on Coronari), 5 minutes from Castel Sant Angelo (in the other direction), about 10 minutes from the Pantheon (via P. Navona) , maybe 15 minutes from Campo di Fiori, so its ideally located. However, what is rarely mentioned is that it is on one of the most picturesque streets in Rome... we saw hordes of tour groups visiting Via Coronari just to photograph it. Coronari, I\u2019m told, used to be one of the roads pilgrims traversed to visit St. Peters, therefore the name Coronari, which means \u2018rosary\u2019, since the street was lined with Rosary sellers. The street is now lined with some beautiful Antique Stores, some quirky Home-Decor Shops, Jewellery Stores, several Restaurants & the usual Tabacchi. The Gelataria Teatro, very popular, is just next door. There is a small Carrefour Express on Coronari, incase you need to buy essentials. There is also a Taxi Stand & a Tourist Information Office at the end of the lane, if you make a right on leaving the Hotel. An extremely charming, picture-postcard street. We were initially assigned Room 102, one of two rooms on the same level as the Reception, except right in the back of the property. The Room was fairly small, dinghy, dimly lit, with the tiniest bathroom ever. It did, however, have its own semi private courtyard area, with a small breakfast table. This review would have perhaps read differently if we had continued here. Fortunately, since the AC refused to function, we were shifted (without fuss) to Room 201, on the first floor (approximately 10 steps up), just across from the Kitchen. We heard practically no noise from the Kitchen area though. Now this room, we were happy with. Spacious, with lots of natural light, two small Balconies, Wooden Floors, largish, well lit Bathroom w/tub (and large, clean towels), big Bed, large Desk area (+ 2 Chairs), small Wardrobe... all very nice. As mentioned in previous reviews, the Room offers a Mini Bar (hidden in the cupboard), a Coffee Maker and a wall mounted Television (with all of 2 English Channels, though). It also has the most fabulously effective, sound proofed Windows, which were essential to shut out the street noise & church bells. The Wi Fi worked well. It is easy enough to create more light in the room by simply turning the heads of the wall lamps, which is what we did. This is a small Design Hotel, so all rooms were different, very aesthetically decorated; ours was brown & blue, which looks better than it sounds! All Public Spaces were also well done, with small paintings, mirrors & book shelves lining the corridors and staircases. The Staff was fabulous down to the Asian gentleman who cleaned our Room. What lovely people! Courteous, efficient, informative... just lovely. A special shout out to both Peter & Daniel for the help provided when my boyfriend contracted a fever, we will remember you fondly. Do remember to take a Map from the Hotel, its bang on! The Breakfast was also good, if limited, but Breakfast in Bed is always great! Always punctual, served exactly as ordered, the Breakfast List included the following items (ad verbatim), Coffee, Milk, Hot Chocolate, Tea, Cappuccino, Fruit Juice, Boiled Eggs, Yogurt, Cereal, Bread \u2013 Butter \u2013 Jam, Honey \u2013 Toasted Bread & Croissants. My only suggestion to the Hotel would be to perhaps pay slightly more attention to the cleaning. Both rooms that we occupied were quite grimy in the corners, the bottom of curtains were dirty, the bathroom had some deeply seated grime, there was a lot of dust & the bed linen was definitely not as clean as it should be. Maybe a really thorough cleaning after every check out would go a long way. But this would by my only complaint.

This hotel was in our price range and was very reasonable by Rome standards. I really wanted to love the place and it did have many good qualities but there were just enough things that I didn't love to make me not want to go back. As others have mentioned, the taxi driver did have trouble finding it even with a map I provided but she did and all ended well. The hotel room was ready within 45 minutes of us arriving which was pretty incredible. We all know how important having a bed is after spending the night in flight. It is gracious of them to offer the rooms early. Check in was efficient but it is not friendly. There is no 'let us help you with your plans' or 'let us know if you need anything' but they were not rude either. Our room was #202 and it was very large with a king sized bed which is almost unheard of in small hotels in Europe. It was a dark room with hardwood floors and a small, semi-modern bathroom. There was a loft area as well which we didn't use except to store our suitcases. We wanted to nap right away and absolutely could not. The walls are paper thin and we could hear every room being vacuumed, every dish being put away from breakfast and every cough and sneeze from any other room. I was so disappointed- to be let into our room early but then be unable to sleep. And I'm not just talking a little noise, it was LOUD. We tried our best and mentioned it to the front desk and he wouldn't hear of a room change. (some desk staff, especially the earlier morning person, were kinder.) We had a very nice breakfast brought to our room the next morning by the timely stone faced chef/cleaner. Not friendly but was accurate with the food order and we enjoyed the breakfast. Our room was made up and cleaned each day although we did not notice it being over the top clean as others have noted. It did not smell of cleaning products but did appear to be clean overall. The sleep at night was fine but again, walls so paper thin that you could hear all of the breakfasts being prepared, people coughing, opening and shutting their doors- kind of like a dorm room. I wonder if staying on the 3rd floor would have given us a different experience. So, although our stay was fine, we probably would not choose this hotel again. The pros are having the room ready so early, the king sized bed, large room and breakfast.

We arrived at the hotel, to a reception only mildly warmer than a 9/11 victim may greet Osama Bin Laden, were he still with us. No 'buongiorno', no 'ciao,' no 'benevenuti' - nothing. A perfunctory 'Passports!' was the first and final communication from the front desk. The room was fine, although toilet seat had obvious crack in it and room signs of wear and tear and no advice or assistance given in relation to local sights, restaurants or even how to work the tv (and no instructions in room). In fact, when my partner went down to reception to ask for assistance with the tv, the staff member was clearly put out at having his football viewing interrupted and told her angrily 'it should work' ... 'just use the big remote' etc etc and only eventually begrudgingly came up to show us how to get a channel. Every time we left the hotel and every time we returned, we received the same surly attitude, from 2 different staff members and it left a very bad taste in our mouths , considering we had spent 29 fantastic nights in Italy with amazingly friendly people and hardly a bad experience. Great location for sure, but completely unnecessary attitude and for half the price, and none of the attitude, stay at A Peace of Rome.

It is actually quite central, and very close to both Piazza Navona and the Vatican City, so it is surprising how quiet it is there. I am a very light sleeper, and slept really well in this hotel. I had a single room, which was small but very clean, and fine for my purposes. The hotel is small so there are only a few other guests. This is by no means a five-star, luxury experience. But if you are looking for something that is clean, comfortable, nicely furnished and in an excellent location, this hotel is perfect. It is within easy walking distance of all the major attractions in Rome, and my favourite gelato place (Gelateria del Teatro - don't miss!) is literally a few steps away. There is also a mini mart diagonally opposite, which was very convenient. The street the hotel is on** is lined with beautiful antique stores, and there are several nice restaurants very nearby as well. (**I am referring to Via dei Coronari, although the hotel is officially on Via dei Gabrielli. Gabrielli is actually more like a courtyard that comes off Coronari, and doesn't appear on all maps of Rome. Coronari, however, is a long street which should appear on your map, and if you walk down Coronari, you will see the hotel easily in its little courtyard a few steps off Coronari.) My room had a small refrigerator and tea / coffee making facilities. The bathroom was impeccably clean and had all the usual bathroom goodies, which were replenished daily. When I came back to the hotel each day, it was clear that it had been cleaned thoroughly, not just made up. The hard wood floors were mopped every day, and every surface in both the bedroom and the bathroom were always sparkling clean. It was so nice to come home to a room that smelled so fresh, unlike other hotels I stayed at in Italy! A perfectly adequate breakfast (continental) is served each day in your bedroom, promptly at whatever time you had requested the previous afternoon. For me, the best thing about staying here (apart from the quiet) was the walk home each day. The hotel is in a really lovely area, on a cobbled backstreet (which minimises street noise) with planter boxes, greenery cascading down the walls, and lots of shuttered windows and old doorways. It was such a pleasure to walk around in the surrounding cobbled backstreets and alleys, which lead you to Piazza Navona in a couple of minutes.

A very satisfactory breakfast is served in the room every day (at exactly the time you order it!!) with everything from croissants/ toast / danishes / eggs / cereal and the usual coffee / tea / hot chocolate - it was lovely not to have to get dressed and go downstairs to a breakfast room (or as in many 2/3 star hotels to a local bar which serves the breakfast) - and unlike many 4+ star hotels there was no \u20ac25 charge for room service. The bathroom was quite small - with only a shower (when we would have loved a bath) - but it was very clean and always serviced with clean towels - so can't complain really Highly recommend this lovely B&B!! I would recommend this highly to anyone", "Date": "June 21, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Relais Palazzo Taverna", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d642968-Reviews-Relais_Palazzo_Taverna-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$92 - $277*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via dei Gabrielli 92</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00186</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "642968", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1b/3f/1b3f817f386f8d05ed4742e8eb6847fd7large.jpg"}}
