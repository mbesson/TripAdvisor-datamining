After being a frequent guest at Motels 6 across the country, this property put me on a \"cannot stay here list\" saying that \"something was missing from my room on a previous stay.\" The could not identify the item or give specifics. The very claim left me speechless, knowing that I always leave a room just as I found it. The fact that I have stayed with Motel 6 as a business guest since 1987 means nothing to them. What would anyone want from a Motel 6 room? Cheap towels? An ashtray? Just avoid this property. I, in response, will take my business to a higher quality brand! My company will do the same", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Spokane, Washington", "Title": "\u201cLots of maintenance issues\u201d", "Author": "Eric A", "ReviewID": "UR131080114", "Content": "Note this is about the \"Suites 6\" property, not the regular M6 next door. I really wanted to like this place, really I did. I'm a low-budget, generally low-expectations traveler and am staying at M6s about 1/2 the time on my cross-country tour. My idea of luxury is an \"extended stay\" hotel/motel where I can do my own cooking, so I was really looking forward to an \"extended stay\" M6 - luxury at a bargain price! :-) But.... This property looked more or less OK when I checked in. The staff was friendly and helpful throughout. A reddish flag went up immediately when, while I was checking in, a guy came to the desk saying that the room he'd been given had not been cleaned and the A/C did not work. But then, mistakes are made, right? My room looked OK - was clean and the A/C worked. The first night there was quite a bit of banging and thumping from upstairs, as if someone was moving in or rearranging the furniture. But it subsided and I slept well. The next morning, I discovered that the outlets above the sink/counter did not work. I also found that, after moving the coffee pot elsewhere, it did not work either. After taking a shower, removing a towel from the rack (not violently, mind you) one end of the rack came off the wall - loose - and fell to the floor. This was a minor thing, I put it back and I'm sure it's fallen off many, many times over the years because the mount to the wall is loose - later confirmed by a maintenance guy. Later that day, I found that inside the microwave, the part that mates the carousel shaft to the tray was missing, therefore no rotation. A minor thing, but something that even a cursory look-over by the staff would have revealed. Likewise, the window has the remains of duct tape around the perimeter, tape that would have served no obvious purpose and that should have been taken down/scraped-off by housekeeping. The next day, my room was overlooked when it came time for cleaning and I had to exchange towels myself. When I pointed out these issues at the front desk, a maintenance guy came, fiddled with the towel rack, shrugged his shoulders about the tape, replaced the coffee maker (after asking me how long I'd been there and suggesting that I should have reported the problem immediately lest the staff think I broke it myself!), and did nothing about the outlet, saying that it was something I had to talk to \"management\" about. Lastly, the $5/stay wireless internet access is abysmal. I would lose the wifi connection over and over during a session, and would get asked over and over again to log in. It was very frustrating for one who works on the net, and who counts on it for last-minute city research. I can't recall having a worse wifi connection at a hotel. The slip of paper they give you with your password specifically says that every device needs its own password (presumably your computer and phone wouldn't work with a single password), that you'll have to log in again every hour, and that your login will expire after some (unspecified) idle period. Awful. Again, I have low expectations, but this cascade of failings is pretty unprecedented even for an M6. Note also that unlike other extended stay hotels, you do not get a dishwasher (or dish soap) or an oven, though you do get a small cooktop. On the plus side: the property is fairly quiet and I slept well though I admit I wear earplugs. The unit was generally clean though there's a bit of perma-stain on the vinyl in the kitchen. The front-desk staff was pleasant and VERY helpful, eventually, without my asking, refunding the cost of a night's stay due to the above issues. The property is a bit of a drive from the French Quarter if that's where you're going to visit, but is right off the highway (I10) that goes to the city so it's easy to get there. Note that if you plan to spend a lot of time downtown, parking is expensive and you might actually save money by staying downtown. All things considered, I would not stay at this property again. For anyone who does, I suggest that you do an immediate walk-through upon arrival to get a fully-functional room.

I was here for JazzFest and compared to other options available for what I received, it was a good price. The room was clean and I slept well each night. During the day I was out and about. I was able to hear road noice from the interstate the first night, but didn't notice it the other 3 nights. There was minor wear and tear on the property. The different workers at the desk were unable to give me directions to the race track where they have the festival which I thought was strange since it is so well known and brings in alot of tourist.

The rooms we have stayed in with this chain have always been clean and functional and the staff has always been courteous and professional. This property is the bad apple. The property itself looks relatively new and is in an area in NO that looks like it is trying to come back, but the place is very poorly maintained. Windows and mirrors dirty, rugs not vacuumed, floors not mopped. Careless repairs; lots of sloppy paint patches, etc. Cleaning and maintainence in general was just sloppy and half-way complete. The young lady at reception was capable, but not overly helpful or friendly. And there seemed to be lots of people just sort of hanging around the lobby and entrance for no particular reason. There always seemed to be someone yelling somewhere in the building at any given time of the day or night. Luckily, we spent most of our stay away from the room. It's a shame.
