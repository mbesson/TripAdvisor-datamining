So my husband went and woke up the guy that does the checking in and told him what was going on and the guy tried to say they have never had any complaints about that room before. When my husband told him he wanted a different room he did give us another room. And after being woke up so that I could pack why my husband went to see how the air condition worked in the other room. I noticed something on the box's springs and I'mcondition worked in the other room. I noticed something on the box's springs and I'm not sure what it was but it was a dark brown color. And when my husband came back to our first room he told me to go see what I thought about the air condition in that room because he said it was hardly blowing any air out and sure enough it wasn't. So we went back to the front desk and told him what the air was doing in the 2nd room. By then my husband was getting mad and we had already paid for 2 nights. So we told the guy that we wanted a refund because it was just too hot to stay there and we had already paid $110.00 but the guy said he did not know how to give refunds that we would need to wait until the morning to get a refund for the 2nd night. We went ahead and tried the 3rd room and the air finally worked. So here I thought this just couldn't get any worse the next morning I got up to take a shower and the water was hardly warm I only was able to wash my hair and my body because by the time I got ready to shave my legs the water was freezing. Oh and before I forget there was a dead bug on the top part of the shower were it connects to the wall and you could tell it had been there for a while. And when I told the guy at the front desk about the water being cold he said it's from everyone taking showers at once.

We got in late the 2nd night of our stay (at 11 p.m.). I knew that by the time I would get to bed, I would not be able to wake up with an alarm. The open sign on the office was still it and in the book provided in the room it said to call 0 for a wake up call. I called for a wake up call. After I asked for a wake up call, I was told not to call after 10 p.m. again and he said it in a rather rude voice. The next night, my fiance went to get ice and almost got attacked by 2 dogs that live in the back part of the building in the monthly rentals. But it was after 10 at night, so we could not call the front desk. The ice machine did not work very good. It took several minutes to fill the provided ice tub in the room. I would never recommend this place to anyone. If we would not have gotten a deal on this room thru a local vacation place, we would have left!

We being, my family, my sister and her family and our parents. The first stay was wonderful and we couldn't wait to stay again. We were very impressed. The rates are really good. On our last stay, however, our impressions turned sour. The first room to which we were assigned was unacceptable. The door had been kicked in (or damaged in a similar nature) and wouldn't stay locked. All you had to do to open it (when it was locked) was turn the doorknob and give it a good push. They were nice enough to move us to a room about four doors down, so we were lucky enough to be able to settle into our room twice. (By the way...they later gave that first room to another customer, without fixing the lock first.) We all settled into our rooms. That night, we were entertained by a domestic disturbance in the room next to us. This involved the police dept. and we were told by management if law enforcement is brought onto the premises, those tenants are immediately asked to leave. This being the case, we naturally assumed our neighbors were gone by the next evening. After spending our first night getting little to no sleep, we were looking forward to a good nights rest...only to find out our neighbors were indeed still there. We also found out...they are regular tenants there. While visiting my parents in their room on our second day...I was privy to a roach crawling up my arm while sitting on there bed. I cannot stand roaches. The rooms weren't absolutely filthy but there was hair in the shower, black marks on the tubs and obviously roaches. There was an inquiry to management as to the condition of cleanliness of our room, to which we were told they are \"smoking rooms\" and that is why they are not as clean as the other \"nonsmoking\" rooms. I guess because some of us smoke...we are not entitled to the cleanliness of non-smokers. Funny, as I thought my money spends just as well as theirs...especially since I paid the same rate they do. Another problem we had is if there were any problems during the night hours...you couldn't get ahold of management at all. The main office was closed until 6 or 7 A.M. This makes dealing with difficult tenants, such as our neighbors, rather impossible. When we complained, yet a second time to management...we were simply told it was our problem to deal with and we should have called the cops. If that was the case...why didn't their first rule of eviction apply in this instance? Don't get me wrong...there were positives to our stay, too. They did replace my sister's tv in her room, as it didn't work. However, they took the tv out of the room we were originally assigned and put her tv back into that room. (Let me tell you..I wouldn't be happy to have a room with a nonfunctional tv and an unlockable door.) They were also kind enough to offer us the use of the lounge for a party of sorts, though we used the pool side to do so. And they told us if we need anything at all to please let them know. We we did, but since it was negative complaints...the reaction wasn't so generous. So, tell them what you need..just don't make it negative. So my basic advice to you is this...if you smoke...don't stay here. Your room will not be as nice as the nonsmoking rooms. If you don't smoke...that is fine...but look out for unruly guests. They may make your night's rest (and next night's rest) a little less restful. And don't complain because this is one motel that believes if you cannot say anything nice...don't say anything at all. I will go out on a limb here, but I don't think I will be staying with the Peach Tree again.", "Date": "July 26, 2003"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Peach Tree Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d226657-Reviews-Peach_Tree_Inn-Branson_Missouri.html", "Price": "$43 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2450 Green Mountain Drive</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:municipality\">Branson</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MO</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">65616</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "226657", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/c1/25/c1253b6fe55839436b86451cf1e200cd1large.jpg"}}
