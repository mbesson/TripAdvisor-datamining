Good thing we just needed some rest and didn't need to come and go as we had no key!!!! They look like they are trying to update it but it needs A LOT of work! Room was comfortable with lots of room to move around, outside entrance & big window made for a chilly room but heater seemed to catch up quickly. Shower was nice but tub left something to be desired, it looked like they tried to paint it and it was pealing off. If you just need a place to lay your head and get some zzz's this will do. It's nothing to write home about!!!!! It was easy to find off the expressway and their are other motels available in the area if you decide this isn't what you're looking for.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seymour, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cOld and crappy\u201d", "Author": "gbtrek", "ReviewID": "UR118379032", "Content": "Bad location, dim parking lot.

Though our credit card had been charged (even though we had not stayed yet), the clerk insisted that we pay again and work out the details later. The clerk, also the manager, called the online reservation center, and they informed him that we did indeed have a reservation. However, he was instructed to wait until he received email confirmation before giving us a room. Once again, he insisted we pay again. After 30 minutes, I asked to cancel the reservation. However, since it was after 3PM, I would have to be charged for the room even though I was no longer willing to stay. After another 30 minutes of arguing with a salesman online, I was given a refund.

We wanted to stop halfway and calculated that we would get there around between 1:00am and 2:00am. We didn't want anything fancy - just a place to lay our heads since we were getting up at 7:00am to head back on the road. We walked in, exhausted, and you could barely breath in the room. It was so humid and reeked of must and mold. We gathered as many \"clean\" towels as we could and made my son sleep on those because the bedding was horribly dirty. The next morning, the tub had black hair/dirt/mold in it, and I was was the 3rd one to take a shower! My father-in-law (who was the first one) said he felt dirtier after the shower than he did before it!

I called ahead for reservations and had trouble with communicating with the reservation clerk over the phone. I nearly missed the hotel as there is no street signage, just a small sign on a sidewall easily missed as there is a Waffle House fronting the streetside. Nevertheless, the clerk at check-in (after midnight) was efficient and courteous. unfortunately, our room quality was very poor. The wall heater did not work, the lights over the bed did not turn on, the tv did not work and the bathroom was barely a closet. The continental breakfast is far below par for today's basic hotel standards. Problems with the room were reported upon checkout and were barely acknowledged.

The beds were comfortable, but the bathroom was great. The counter by the sink was huge! My favorite amenity. The sink and toilet were also not in the same room! Another amenity I really like. The staff was also helpful, which isn't always true at budget properties. But the best feature of this motel is the Waffle House immediately on the other side of the building.
