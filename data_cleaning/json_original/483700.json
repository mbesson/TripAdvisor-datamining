Shope & restaurants only a 10 minute walk away. I would recommend paying for breakfast (or make sure it's included in the cost of your stay). Breakfast is everything you'd want (hot & cold food, wide selection) & stays open until 11am if you want to have a lie in! What stops this being an excellent experience?

The hotel in general has a modern feel to it without trying too hard.

We booked a superior family room at this hotel. We stayed for 8 days. The hotel was very clean. It was within a 10 minute walk of the nearest Metro Stop - Hospital-Clinic. We had the breakfast for 5 days of our stay which cost 30 Euros per day for the family. The breakfast was of a decent standard and we found it helped set us up for the day as it meant we were not wandering around trying to decide where to go for breakfast. (We had enough of that at lunch and dinner) The hotel is only 3 stops on the metro (with 1 change) from the Place de Catalunya and the heart of the city. We went to the Camp Nou twice and got a taxi back to the hotel after both games. Taxi cost 10 Euros first time and 7 Euros the second so very reasonable. We left the hotel at 5am in the morning for an early morning flight and the taxi transfer cost 35 Euros. All in all - this hotel is ideal for a break in Barcelona, not in the heart of the city but do not listen to reviews that say it is to far from the metro - it is at best a 10 minute walk there and we would often get a metro back and then have a drink and a coffee in one of the cafes, bars in the local vicinity which were far cheaper than in the city centre.

We went for 4 nights in May to Amister and overall we liked. A major concern is the location though, it is far from everything, metro station included, and all the sightseeing. I booked this one following the reviews and I think the overall judgement on Amister is correct, it is good, new, nicely furnished. For breakfast, there are a lot of good and inexpensive options around, never tried the hotel one. For dinner, the situation is more complicated - we were advised by the hotel staff of some restaurant not far call Mediterranean or something like that. Please don't go, they pretend to be upscale, they say \"oh, you don't have a reservation? Oh, let me see, what we can do...\" while the restaurant is empty...Expensive also and food not great. So no concerns on facilities or rooms, the hotel is new. Again my main concern is the distance from everything. I understand Barcelona is not a city where the things to see are all together, like Madrid, but still every morning you need to do 15 minutes walking to the metro station, and at night it is not the best walk you might want to do (and I am used to this kind of things...). So - if you are a fancy fashionable lady not ready to walk, or your wife/girlfriend is, you better look for something else or be ready to pay for lots of cabs! Would I go again?

The staff at reception are nice especially the man that works the night shift. They where very helpful and spoke excellent english. However we were not given any maps, tourist information etc. on arrival. We had to ask about everything. Also there is no tourist information booklet in the room which i think would be very helpful . You get a discount on the \" Bus Touristic \" ( open top bus tour ) by the way, which is really good. We did the 2 day tour and thought it was brilliant. The room we got on the first night was at the back of the hotel and was not very nice, it was very small and looked out on to a very dark area with NO natural light. The next morning we asked to be moved to the front of the hotel which was no problem at all. We got a twin room which was fine, just join the beds together ! We got breakfast one morning which costs 10.80 euro. A bit expensive but it was really nice and the selection of food was brilliant. Overall it is a nice hotel but not amazing. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the metro station which takes you where ever you want to go. It took us about 40 minutes to walk to Las Ramblas ! It is definately not in a great location. To get from the airport just get the RENFE to Sants Estacio, costs 3 euro and takes 20 mins. Then its a 10/15 min walk to the hotel. The selection of room service is poor and it is only available until 11pm. The only english speaking stations on the TV are CNN and BBC news. Being ther for 6 nights it would have been nice to watch a bit of TV.

We did not try the breakfast at 10.70 Euro pp. We are not big eaters, and for under 10 Euro, we could get a feed of bakery items, with juice and coffees. My one complaint about the hotel is they oversold themselves on the first night of 5. We arrived about 6:30pm, having prepaid for the first night, booking a double room. Nothing was mentioned at reception, but upon entering our room on 2nd floor, we noticed it was two singles pushed together. We left luggage in the room, wanting to go out for some food, via reception, asking, nicely, if a Double room was available, as per the booking.

The Amister Hotel is a very modern hotel and the rooms were exceptionally clean, bright and comfortable offering a safe and mini bar. If you check-in late and room service are no longer serving then I would strongly recommend that you go and grab yourself a delicious pizza from literally around the corner. If you come out of the Amister turn right and you will come across a pizza restaurant, which you can order take-away from and eat in your room. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel as we had read recent reviews that the Amister charges 13 Euros! To walk from the Amister to La Rambles you are looking at approximately a 25-30 minute walk, however you could take a cab, which takes about 10 minutes. If you are looking to taste typical plates of the Catalan Kitchen then you should pay a visit to Can Culleretes restaurant which is the oldest restaurant of Barcelona and the second oldest of Spain.

Loved Barcelona as destination. Bought a travel card and just used the metro system to get around - all the main attractions are easy to get to. Highly recommend Sagrada Familia Church well worth the entrance fee ( do go see the museum underneath) and a must see is Parc Guell (great panaoramic views of the city ) and lots of Gaudi design and the Mercat de la Boqueria just off Las Ramblas - definately for foodies, lots of lovely fresh produce and the displays of fish and seafood are amazing to see. Also if you have time walk along the beach front from the bottom of Las Ramblas to the Olympic Village. Food fantastic and lots of good lunchtime deals from all the restaurants. As it was my birthday we chose to eat my birthday evening meal at Can Culleretes which was not as expensive as we thought it would be and the food and the atmosphere were really special. Their evening set menu was well worth every penny. Its the oldest restaurant in the city and is just off Las Ramblas on Carrer Quintana. One word of warning - keep your eyes open on the metro for groups of women who hussle you onto the train and surround you. On our way back to the airport my bag (worn under my coat) was opened and they had out my passport ( from an inside zipped pocket) which was dropped on the floor as I had started yelling and causing a fuss about not being able to get away from them Im sure they would have had just about everything out of my bag in seconds.

The Bad Points Took us 1 hour 15 mins to check-in (there was a group pf delegates checking-out after a conference); the 11 euro breakfast while nice is seriously over-priced; the hotel is far from the city centre and a 10-12 mins brisk walking distance from Hospital Clinic (the nearest Metro station); our room was freezing as their heating was not working; there were no porters to help with baggage. Tips Coming from the airport to the city centre it's best to get the airport bus and get off at the second stop at Urgell. This means staying on the bus past Catalunya and Prestige Paseode Gracia. The bus then goes down Avenue de Roma. The city is best experienced during high season May to September as a lot of the attractions had restricted opening times or were closed completely Also the weather did not feel very Mediterranean and rained quite a bit which prevented us from visitng some of the oudoor attractions.", "Date": "February 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cGreat place to stay\u201d", "Author": "Savethebesttilllast", "ReviewID": "UR8850614", "Content": "I stayed here with my boyfriend who is vegan.
