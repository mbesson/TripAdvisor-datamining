However, if you are looking for a nice, relaxing, slightly upscale hotel, this is not the one. The rooms reminded me of motels in the US -- aging rooms, fittings, and amenities. Staff is overloaded due to high traffic volume. Lots of flight crew in the hotel as well. I went to the Dragon Inn restaurant, and it took them so long to get me my order, it was ridiculous. Internet access was great. I booked a reservation that gave me 24-hour checkout which was great.

The female receptionist was efficient but lacked any warmth. The concierge's staff (Johnny and Leon) were helpful and gave good advice about how to get places. The bedroom had two double beds (I was travelling alone) so plenty of space to spread out. The bedroom and bathroom were clean though I felt the inside of the bath could have benefited from an extra scrub! Also I found a drawerful of coins from a previous guest so housekeeping could be improved. Tea and coffee making facilities, an iron and board, in-room safe, hairdryer, slippers and bathrobes contributed to a pleasant stay. Very minimal noise from the airport and the view from my window was across the end of the runway to the sea. I ate in the airport where food is apparently cheaper than the hotel. Check out was at 12 noon but as my flight was not until the evening I was able to store my luggage with the concierge at no cost, and take the free shuttle bus to a nearby mall. From there I took the cable car up to the giant buddha - quite an amazing trip and a good way to spend the afternoon. There are nice spa and pool facilities at the hotel (the former quite expensive, I thought) but I was not in a mindset for them.

It is a \"transient hotel\"--and prone to having tour groups trying to check-in at all hours of the day and night. Seems many Chinese cannot read room numbers--and often you will awaken to the sound of some hapless traveler trying his key in your door. Very annoying and ongoing. Their breakfast buffet used to be quite decent--but the selection has diminished and I often skip it--even though it is included. Of better quality--but quite pricey--are room service selections. Some rooms' climate control is ineffective: It can become too cold or quite humid. It is not uncommon to return to the front desk and request a room change for such reasons.

All the hotels in the area offer a free shuttle bus to and from the airport, some are attached to shopping malls or subway stations. However, for ease of access none really beat the Regal. Having said that, it is often not the cheapest option, so shop around before booking. My last three stays at the Regal have been for about eight hours each - purely transit. It is always busy and understandably so. The Regal is the only hotel at HKIA that you can walk to. Unlike Singapore's Changi, you have to clear customs and \"arrive\" in Hong Kong before you can get to your bed. I should hasten to say that this is not the hotel's fault. However, that extra time spent clearing customs is deducted from your all too brief sleep before your next flight. The hotel is fairly typical for a Hong Kong business traveller's class of hotel, in that it is modern, clean and well appointed without being luxurious. The rooms are \"compact\" without being cramped. There is a flat screen LCD TV on the wall, mini bar, complimentary bottled water, a comfortable bed and desk area. The room has a reliable alarm clock and there is a wakeup call service. Annoyingly, there is a charge for internet access. The bathroom is equally modern and well appointed with a bath/ shower and a sit-down style toilet (although the squat variety are just about extinct in Hong Kong hotels, I still get asked by first time visitors to China). There are the usual bathroom supplies plus the very handy shaving kit and toothbrush. The bed in my room was excellent and the room quiet enough for even the lightest sleeper. My last trip coincided with a level 8 Typhoon warning (gale force winds), strong winds and heavy rain were causing quite a noise outside, but I barely noticed it and slept through. The staff are efficient and courteous. I've never found them to be less than polite. However, this hotel is busy 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The front desk is under relentless pressure. I could well imagine getting a little jaded if my working day was like that, so I think they do a great job under tough conditions. There is a gym and a pool, but with an eight hour stop over they were not on my to-do list. The Regal fulfils the role of transit hotel very well, and I could imagine staying for two to three days if there was something that kept me in the area. This is not a hotel for a tourist visiting Hong Kong for a holiday, there are better located options in Kowloon or on the island.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles", "Title": "\u201cPoor service and facilities\u201d", "Author": "Carfield0830", "ReviewID": "UR137641913", "Content": "This is my second stay (my first stay was almost five years ago), and unfortunately, the hotel has shown clear signs of rundown. To make things worst, the front desk staffs were rude and unfriendly. I felt like someone was pointing a gun at them and they did not smile at all. When I checked in, the agent did not realize that I bought a package that allowed a 4pm check out. My runway view room was never honored but after the incident with the broken TV, I was too tired to ask for another room change. BTW, their 24 hours policy advertised at the website does not apply to normal room rate unless specifically mentioned. I considered false advertisement. The check-out was worst - the staff rather chatted with her colleague and instead of handing me a proper receipt, she just threw one at me. She did not care about my well being or wanted my business again. The room was in the same state as five years ago with no update. Lots of scratches and marks in the sofa and walls. The television set was broken and required two different staffs to fix it. The only staffs that smiled were the bell boys and the engineer that fixed the TV. The rest of the staffs were stressed out and showed no incentive to provide good service. The only benefit was the location of the hotel, which was at the airport, but I still felt both Novotel Citygate and Marriott Hong Kong airport are much better accommodation options, even with the shuttle ride. So go with these other two hotels unless you have a late arriving flight or a super early morning flight.

First off I work at a 5 star hotel in Hong Kong myself so i was hoping for a special accommodation deal after landing hong kong in late afternoon. Called up the reservation department and told them I would have my brother checking in first as he will arrive at 11AM and I'll be arriving later at around 6PM, they refused as under hotelier rate the hotelier person needs to check in first. Now I've stayed in many different hotels around the world and I always got special deals without me checking in first, this is the first time ever i got rejected. I've offered them my business card via e-mail, even allow them to offer me BAR rate then later on honouring the industrial rate in case i failed to show up, all got rejected by their reservation manager. I was furious and just hang up the phone. Then turned out Ctrip offered the exact same deal but even better - room with breakfast and complimentary late check out until 1500hrs with 1 free welcome drink, boom! My brother changed his flight so we both arrive late in the afternoon. Read the other review on having massive Chinese group checking in was not the case for me, the counter was emptied. So this lady 'J' at the reception greeted us with no smile and I gave her the ID and the luggage tag for check in, I've actually punched in a non smoking room twin beds but yet she have to ask again (note here not reconfirming), that got me into thinking whether the request was in placed at all. She returned me the ID and the credit cards by placing on the counter without even tried to say here you go thank you, i was amazed. And when i asked to have the late check out confirmed at 1500 she said no latest is 1400hrs, I then showed her the confirmation on my cell which stated LCO until 1500 free of charge and 1 welcome drink, she looked confused and started asking her colleagues and supervisors around, and of course she did issue out the coupon. We were then assigned to room 7066. Room key given, no smile still, no thank you whatsoever, didn't even bother pointing where the elevator was until we asked. fantastic service this. Went up to the room, perhaps this was the best part of our stay - the view, I overlooked the arrival runway with the sunset, very good sound proof as well with the double layered glass windows. The room looked dated, curtains seemed dirty (there were dusts falling off we we tried to close the curtains!), kinda disguisting. Waited for 15 minutes the luggage won't come, so I called reception and the lady \"R\" transferred me to the bell desk, and they actually asked where my luggage tag was and what's the number! so I told him i gave it to the lady at check in, he then advised the bags would be up in 10 minutes, pfff... We then headed out straightaway as we had dinner reservation made at the disneyland hotel, we then noticed the toilet won't flush properly, guess what's the reason? it's all rusty! So we had to pay a visit at the reception desk and asked for assistance. Just glad they had that fixed before we returned. The pillows were way too soft i could hardly sleep. Anyway the next morning we went for breakfast, it was ok but way too crowded. When we returned to the room to enjoy the view just before we leave, i couldn't help but to notice there was a consumed water bottle stucked in the bottom of the sofa! How disguisting was it! On top of this the maid knocked on the door and asked whether we would like to have the room being serviced. I told her we were due to check out so there's no need for that. On normal occations if a room is due to check out you won't go and ask, if a guest wants the room to be serviced he/she would either call or leave the 'clean up' sign lit, this amazed me. Check out was even appalling.

Sadly, each time I have stayed it has been worse and worse, which is ironic because the room rates have gone in the opposite direction - higher and higher. The last time I stayed (November 2011) will be the last time I stay. The rate I was charged was over US$200 for just one night (actually about 10 hours to be literal). The room smelled both of cigarette smoke and mold. The fittings were simply tatty. I had no access to wireless. The carpet was stained and dirty. The place was more like one that should charge by the hour rather than the night. It's a shame because this is so convenient but therein I suspect is the problem - they get the guests because people do not realise they have other options so I feel very much like they are taking advantage of that fact.

Backi n in my room it stopped working again....rang the reception and was invited down again, again she got it working...back to room....stopped working. This time i asked the recptionist to come to my room to fix but she explained she couldnt leave the desk.

After explaining that the ethernet cable wont work on a iPad i was tyold she could do nothing for me as all the rooms were booked. I left the iPad problem and eventually went to bed, only when all the lights and television were closed down and silence fell on the room did i notice the worlds worst form of torture...drip..drip..drip, I got up to look round but for the life of me could not find out where the dripping noise was coming from, eventually after using my earphones on noise reduction mode i was able to get to sleep...but sleeping in headphones aint the best, after a restless night I woke to open the curtains and tadaa.....the dripping showed its ugly face, in between the outer window and the inner window it was pouring in, I advised reception and she said someone from housekeeping would come...they never did.

I explained that the room still had the leak and was not in a fit state but it all fell on deaf ears. What puzzles me is how could i pay the extra money to stay the extra hours if the room was already booked ???? The other thing to note is that they have installed a coffee machine in each room which they give you 1 pod for, its makes approx 1/4 of the cup they give you to use, if you want more you have to ring reception, even then they can only give you 1 at a time, useless if you want a morning cup of coffee.

Check-in and check-out was efficient, and despite arriving at 7.30am our room was available immediately. I was disappointed that our room did not have a view of the runway as expected with a Club room, but then was delighted to see that we had actually been given a suite which had a separate living area and small private courtyard which was perfect for us travelling with our 2 children.

We were a couple with a newly adopted child so this was a nearly stress free transfer. We also had dinner in the basic hotel resturaunt which looks like a buffet but has off the menu selections as well at reasonable prices. The kids menu is extensive and also reasonably priced. Our room was clean and comfortable and quiet for an airport hotel. They brought a nice crib for our child right up and I do not think there was an extra charge. The gym was nice, uncrowded and open long hours. Remember that HK requires a UK-style plug for electronic devices which is different than what you need in Mainland China. For a single night between flights this hotel is hard to beat, if only there were more like this in the US!

Cathay Pacific provided us a voucher for bed and breakfast. This followed the snow delays at Heathrow. We checked in at about mid-night, amongst about 180 others (we counted the vouchers the next morning!). A young female receptionist took our voucher to check us in, but did not say a word to us until she told us our room number and pointed one direction, then changed her mind and pointed the other way. When we went to the room, we found it was a smoking room (having got used to not having to ask in the UK). It smelled awful, so we went straight back to reception to the same receptionist, rather than going to the back of a very long queue. She was finishing off serving another guest but was talking on her i-phone. We noticed she was extremely animated on her phone, smiling and joking to whoever she was talking to, something she failed to do with us or the guest in front of her. The receptionist finished her call and then continued without speaking to the guest in front of her except to tell her the room number. When the guest she was dealing with was leaving, she was given the same vague waving of arms in both directions we were given and the receptionist wasn't paying any attention. We told the receptionist we couldn't stay in the room we were given, because it was a smoking room. Again, there was no communication with us. Whilst we were being dealt with another guest spoke to the receptionist asking for directions to her room, the receptionist looked up and waved in a general direction to her right. The young female guest looked confused and ended up standing to one side waiting to speak to another receptionist. We were given a room number and yet again were given two directions to go in, having already been to the lifts, we knew where to go. The room was ok, functional and clean. We struggled to get the shower working but then whilst my wife was showering I read a letter on the table in the bedroom. This explained about the hotel doing repairs to the hot water system overnight. At this point I remembered seeing a guest checking in with another receptionist who was being shown a letter and the receptionist pointing out something in it. When we went for breakfast, we were asked for a voucher, but we didn't have one. The staff in the restaurant made enquiries with reception whilst we were eating but at the end we were told by a male member staff that reception had told him we needed to pay. After a discussion, he gave us the bill and asked us to go to sort it out with reception. As this was an unscheduled stop, we didn't have all out toileteries, so decided to pop into the airport terminal immediately adjacent to the hotel to go and buy some deodorant, before we went to reception. As we were about half-way down the walk-way the staff member from the restaurant caught up with us and demanded we go to reception to sort out the bill. We tried to explain that we hadn't checked out and we were planning to deal with the bill in about 20 minutes. He was agitated and wanted it dealt with immediately. We went back with him to reception, it felt as if we were being escorted back as if we had been trying to sneak off without paying. Back at reception, we were dealt with by another female receptionist who was efficient and helpful, the member of staff from the restaurant standing constantly by our side. The receptionist found the vouchers from Cathay Pacific (she told us 180) and looked through them. She didn't find us the first time, so my wife and I took a third each and helped her. I found the voucher which clearly showed it included breakfast. The member of staff from the restaurant was given our vouchers and left without saying another word to us, no apology for our inconvenience. We asked to speak to a manager to complain about the poor service the previous night and the receptionist promptly brought back a supervisor. He was helpful and appeared to listen to what we said. He said he would speak to her and suggested the receptionist ahould have dealt with the guests as a priority. He said he would make a note of our complaint and would see if the receptionist needed some training or a warning. Although he was helpful, my wife and I were not convinced anything would happen.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Perth, Western Australia", "Title": "\u201cAwkward.\u201d", "Author": "MissAfternoonDelight", "ReviewID": "UR124011103", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel for 1 night on the way home from a business trip with a friend from work.

I decided to book a reservation because our flights on Christmas day will be early, so it's much more convenient to be nearer to the Airport than travel from L'Hotel Island South.

What happened was that there are too many people on the line, and too many complaining that every employee on the reception are a little, I don't know, stressed up? And there were only like 3 receptionist. I waited for around 40 minutes on the line just to be checked in. That was the worst part, since we weren't able to visit much of the Citygate Outlet's shops. I was hoping we can get checked at around 8PM but it took longer so we arrived at Citygate around 9, which was closing time for most of the good shops. Anyways enough of that, back to the hotel part. So my check-in wasn't really that of a hassle. I just think that more receptionist can make it faster since people like me were able to finish checking in a short time, but other people have concerns far greater than us, so in a sense all people in the line suffer, no matter how long or short the time we spend talking to the receptionist. You all get my point. After that line, we were able to get to our room. It's a superior room by the way, double bed. It's good, with (very big) bathrobes, toiletries, iron and ironing board, safe, TV (with more channels), complimentary coffee and tea with hot water already in the pot, complimentary water, and a stocked but overpriced mini-bar. The bed was good and comfortable, the noise level of the planes minimal. Very spacious if you asked me. I can even sleep on the sofa. Very comfortable and relaxing stay.

Poor staff and lousy communication in a process that went on forever with desk clerk running back and forth, checking various papers and files, going to a nearby office etc. The hotel required a 500 HKD deposit the night before and we had no charges to our room. On check out they refused to clear or credit the deposit and said it would take their bank 2 - 3 weeks to credit our credit card for the deposit. I have never ever heard of any hotel doing this including other hotels in Hong Kong, Xi'an, and Beijing.

I chose an airport location as my inbound flight arrived at 6.30am afer a long overnight flight from Auckland and didn't want to face travelling into a city centre hotel with baggage - I also had an early morning departure to London on my outward leg of the journey. Within 15 minutes of collecting my bags from the carousel, I had checked in after walking through the arrivals hall - the hotel is linked to the hall by way of a covered walkway. Check in was efficient - by the time I had filled in my registration card and found my way to my room, the bags had already been delivered by the porter. After showering, I made my way back to the terminal ( a 3 minute walk) and caught the train into the city centre. I chose not to eat in the hotel - you pay tourist rates, but the choice was good for those of you who choose to eat in house. To give some idea, I paid $60HK for a 660ml beer at the bar, whereas earlier in the evening I had eaten a large portion of delicious fried noodles and a litre jar of beer in a local 'restaurant' in Kowloon - this cost me $40HK. The room rates were a little pricier than some equivalents in town, but I found my stay at this location maximised the amount of time I spent in Hong Kong itself. It is brilliantly located and would stay there again, given my flight timings. The room was very clean, and despite the location adjacent to the runway, I didn't find noise a problem.

When travelling through Hong Kong, I usually stay at the Novotel CityGate, however their shuttle bus to the airport only commences at 6.30am. As I had to check out at 4.30am, I chose the Regal because it's connected to the airport and is a convenient one minute walk to the terminal. This is the ONLY benefit of staying at this hotel. Upon check in (after 10pm), the staff could not locate my booking, despite it being booked directly on their website. When it was finally found, I handed over my frequent flyer card, as they have a large promotion card on their counter. I was promptly and rudely told that because I had already booked \"the cheap rate\", I couldn't be awarded any frequent flyer points. I explained that I did not book a \"cheap rate\" and it was actually the full rack rate on their website, because it was booked last minute. I was told \"oh well\". When I then enquired about wi-fi connection, I was told that would be an extra HKD150 - for a mere 6 hour stay. I had booked a non-smoking room and when I exited the lift on my floor, the entire hotel reaked of cigarette smoke. Expecting my room to be the same, I wasn't surprised when there were ashtrays and a smoky smell in there. I went back down to reception to complain about this, and was told, yes of course other people smoke in there - it's a non smoking room for my stay!! The room itself is large enough, however it was untidy and clearly has not been renovated since the 1970s. The decor is horrible and the bathroom leaves a lot to be desired. The amount of money they charge for this hotel is disgraceful, when considering the state of the rooms - and then they have the audacity to charge HKD18 for a miniature bottle of mouth wash, something which any other decent hotel would provide free of charge. Obviously all the money goes towards the lobby and lounge bar - they actually look quite nice, but that's it. I travel quite a lot and stay in higher end hotels almost everywhere I go, so I have a number of other hotels to compare this to. This hotel, although claiming to be marketed towards international travellers, fails to meet even basic standards. They do not have any universal power points in the rooms and when asking for an adaptor at the front desk, the staff look at you like you have two heads. This hotel is more like a 2 or 3 star mainland China hotel, rather than an expensive Hong Kong hotel which is supposed to provide respite for weary travellers.

Having to pay for wifi was outrageous, but it can be avoided by periodically ducking out into the airport terminal and using the airport's free wifi network. Room service was reasonably swift and not too expensive. I did appreciate having a kettle and tea and coffee making provisions in the room, which showed an attention to detail - and to travellers' needs - not evident in so much of the hotel. There were no robes in the room, only slippers, but housekeeping were happy to deliver a robe when I called and requested one (but, again, I'd have thought this would come as standard). The hotel's pools are looking pretty tired and, during my visit, neither pool was heated, despite claims on the hotel's website that the indoor pool is heated. In short, this hotel is a mixed experience: overpriced and characterless but extremely convenient. However, if you are in Hong Kong for 24 hours or longer and are trying to decide whether to stay at the airport or venture into the city, I would recommend the latter: the Airport Express gets you into Hong Kong Central in 25 minutes, round the clock, and you can check in to your flight at Central, making it a stress-free and seamless exercise even if you have a very early or late flight.

Not sure what kind of line it was, we asked directly to front desk about checking out and asking our deposit refund. Instead of doing a quick check out and refunding, the front desk argued and asked us to queue in the line instead. Apparently there was no dedicated check out line. we tried to queue, but after 5 minutes it was only moved by one person. So we have to go to airport to avoid losing our flight. From this experience, we don't see any much benefit of having the hotel next to airport if we still need to really come early to queue to check out. Other nearby proper hotels that have check out line, are probably better options. In the end, I tried to contact the hotel via email about the deposit refund. But no respond so far.

The hotel has a huge lobby and has a nice interior.The best part was, we were upgraded to an apartment--which is more than double the rate of our reserved room!! In this apartment, we have a king-sized bed with own TV and a sofa(not sofa bed) in the spacious living room with flat screen tv, and a kitchen complete with ref, stove, toaster, microwave, kettle and utensils, china ware. Free bottled water available, as well as coffe/tea. Wifi available in the room for a fee. The living room and the bedroom have a balcony with views of the lobby. It also has a coffee table outside which we didnt use. The bathroom was clean with hot/cold water, but the tub was shallow and small for me (a six footer) and close to overflowing, shower head was low and would have preferred it in a detachable flexible hose-type shower head. The BR is equipped with hair dryer, outlets for shavers and toiletries were complete. The room was sound-proofed so you can sleep well. The hotel have lots of food choices but we didn't eat there because of budgetary constraints. We decided to just take an early lunch at Disneyland so what we did was go to the airport which has a 7-11 store and bought our drinks and bread. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.

My reservation was prepaid weeks in advance with a couple of not difficult requests. Upon check-in I had the luck to have one of the less rude front desk clerks. They said they had no room with two beds and tried hard to get me to take a room with one bed. The situation might have been better if the front desk clerk could speak and understand English; she couldn't. Most couldn't. While waiting over 30 minutes to check in because management can't do their jobs, I heard a Japanese flight attendant tell her front desk clerk, \"I don't know how to do your job, but I would never talk to a customer the way you did to me.\" Between the rudeness and the ineptitude of management to have a room ready (did they read the comments about late arrival? did they note the number of beds needed? did they note request of feather-free for a severe asthmatic? No on all 3 accounts), it was a most unpleasant experience. This is not the perfect antidote after a long flight. The next point was an argument with an employee while one of our party scoped out the emergency exits on our floor. Then came the free Wi-Fi that had not been connected by the front desk clerk, even after seeing it noted on the reservation, resulting in a 40 minute phone call to the Philippines (who were much more pleasant than any employee at this hotel) before finally getting connected- so much for the hotel offering free Wi-Fi on my room package. The breakfast buffet was a typical buffet. The fruit was truly awful, but looked pretty. The hot food chef was verbally abrasive when I took an egg from under the heat lamp. Since there is no sign how was I supposed to know that those eggs are not for every hotel guest? Thankfully screaming back in Mandarin got me an egg. Don't try English, it's not understood. The room itself was roomy by HK standards. It was clean but already showed signs of needing repairs, especially in the bathroom. There were two tiny bottles of water for free. Then you pay a fortune for bottled water. Since everything at the hotel closes by midnight, you would need to walk back to the airport to get any other supplies, including more water. Check out was with another impersonal, poor English communicating desk clerk capping an overall lousy experience especially for the price we paid. Would I stay here again? If I needed to: it's but a 10 minute slow walk from one end of the airport. But I would rather go into town and have better service and better food for this price. Do not expect much English here.

The trip would consist of myself and my cousin, but I came in a day earlier than my cousin. So for 1 day, I was by myself. For the majority of the trip, my cousin and I were planning on staying at the Golden Crown Guest House (which is an amazing guest house to stay in). However, since I arrived a day earlier, I couldn't add an extra day to the Golden Crown Guest House. So upon pondering my predicament, I thought it would be best to stay near the airport so it would be easier to meet with my cousin who was arriving the next day earlier in the morning. With that said, I've looked at different options around Hong Kong International airport and I decided on the Regal Airport Hotel since it's literally connected to the airport itself. Once you arrive, if you go to terminal 1/A, the walkway to the hotel is located right behind the Starbucks stand. Super convenient. The hotel offers a unique check-in/check-out time. Basically, you can check in any time and check out time is 24 hours from the time of when you check in. Wireless internet services is offered at the hotel for a very expensive surcharge. I believe if I remember correctly, I paid $30 US for total usage. I booked through a travel website, but I believe if you book directly through the Regal hotel's website, they offer free internet services when you stay. The staff was very friendly and professional. For example, when I arrived, I checked in, got in to my room and showered. Well, the bath water wouldn't drain and for the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to get it to drain. So I called the front desk with my dilemma and was expecting to wait 20 or 30 minutes for someone to come and fix the bathtub. To my surprised, 2 minutes later, someone knocked at my door, fixed the problem and was out all in 5 minutes. Impeccable service. The hotel is very, very, very luxurious. Fountains, top notch restaurants, ect. It has just about everything plus it's connected to the airport which has a 7-11 and a variety of restaurants of many different cuisine at the airport to satisfy your taste buds. This hotel is definitely expensive so it shouldn't be expected to be anything less than top of the class. (On a side note, a lot of the hotels around the airport and in downtown are pretty expensive as well, hence that's why my cousin and I stayed at a guesthouse for the remainder of our time in Hong Kong.) The rooms are very clean, very spacious, and full of detailed personal conveniences. The only thing I regret, is that I didn't stay in my room for most of the time I was there. As soon as I arrived, checked in, and clean up, I was out the door looking for adventures and didn't return until very late at night. Overall the hotel is an excellent stay, but it is very far away from downtown Hong Kong.

Throughout my stay (one week), I experienced some good & bad service which didn't bother me too much. However at the very end at checkout in the afternoon with the club level staff (I selected the club level package), I was totally pissed off with what happened. I got my bill which required payment of the meals plus a laundry charge. I immediately told the club staff the laundry charge was a mistake since I got 2 free ironing/pressing per day for staying at club level room & all I requested was pressing 1 new shirt. She removed the laundry charge and let me paid only the meals. After the payment, she got on the phone to ask another staff regarding the laundry charge. Afterwards, she told me that it seemed like the laundry staff not only pressed my shirt, but also washed it, & hence I had to pay for the washing fee. She asked if I could wait for 10 minutes for laundry staff to investigate if they washed my shirt or not, she explained that because if they did wash it then I had to pay for the washing. Of course I told her No & I would not wait because it was their mistake to not follow my order form & I would not agree to pay. Who know how long the \"10 minute\" could actually take??? I told her if they insisted to charge the cost, i would dispute through credit card (It's definitely not about the small amount of money but about principal ). She sensed the tension & called the laundry to stop the investigation. Seriously, she expected me to wait for at least 10 minutes for that? I was in a rush to check in to my flight and would rather spend extra time shopping inside the airport. What kind of club level customer service was that? They made a mistake & wanted me to pay for it & wanted me to sit there wasting my time to wait for the investigation. It was an awkward ending & she did not apologize at all. I could have asked for compensation for washing my new shirt without my permission as well if I had time to sit there. Other cons & pros: Cons --- my package included free buffet breakfast daily, I had it once but followed with bouts of diarrhea, never went back for breakfast again --- had to change rooms twice due to construction noises of club levels. Although I still had club level benefits after moving to regular floor, housekeeping was worse including no more fruits in the room, less bathroom supplies like comb. I called to request a comb, & operator told me there was no comb in the hotel! I told her that I had comb at club level room & moved down due to noises, she immediately sent someone to bring me a comb. What a stupid lie. --- I asked for detergent to do self-service laundry. The club level staff told me where in the hotel that I could get it done, but told me incorrectly that there was no detergent & I had to buy my own. She suggested me to find a shop at airport to get detergent. I couldn't find it & she suggested me to go to the city to buy detergent! However the next day when I talked to staff near the gym where the self-service machines were, they told me they had detergent available for a small cost. I was just not pleased at how difficult & how long it took me to get something simple done. A simple request & need that should have been met easily yet the club level staff did not want to help & offered wrong information --- did not give me any reward points or Asia miles because I did not book directly with the hotel. I booked through hotels.com & they said they could not give me even a single point or mile. The only reward points I got were the expenses at hotel restaurants. But there was a huge difference of points I could have gotten for hotel stays compared to meals. --- Loud & whining staff at 2nd floor chinese dim sum restaurant. I ate there twice. First time was during quiet hours late afternoon, it was very quiet but the staff kept complaining loudly about their long hours of work. The 2nd time it was near the end of lunch hours, staff was so busy cleaning up and setting up clean tables for the evening that they basically ignored me, hard to even get attention for hot tea refill. ---non-smooth wireless service, whenever I let my smart phone idle for a moment, I had to sign in again for internet service, so the internet service kept getting interrupted. It was better with laptop though. --- old furnitures & bathtub Pros --- the only hotel that's directly attached to airport (that maybe reason why you couldn't expect much customer service since they don't worry about volume of customers, not sure if other Regal branches also has similar \"cold\" attitude & management) ---Great shanghai food at G level, good customer service. ---30% discount for restaurant if you pay for club level rooms ---Staff at entrance to airport walkway was helpful with bags Overall, I would not stay again if it's not attached to airport.

Decaf coffee (might sound pedantic, but when you trying to get a precious few hours of sleep, it maters) 2. Cleaner bathrooms, the grouting was black and nasty, and the towels are paper thin, the shower drain didn't drain, so I was showering in half a foot of water 3.

When you consider that they have a half daily rate (must be out before 11pm), then 40 minutes to check-in is a long time, there were 4 staff members, and 4 open terminals, priority is for airline crews, and it moves at a snail pace.

We noted that one person took about twenty minutes to check in once she got to the agent. I have no idea how long she waited in total.

But that's pretty much its only good point. It has lots of signs up proudly stating that it is the 'best airport hotel in the world'. This is certainly not the case, maybe Skytrax have not ever stayed in any other airport hotels? The Hilton at Narita and the Sofitel at Gatwick both outclass this hotel as a start. As stated in other reviews, check in and out takes a long time. Regardless of the eight desks that exist, management need to realise you need to put staff behind them for them to operate. There were only two desks open whenever we were there and there was always a queue. We booked two rooms and requested them to be connecting as we were travelling with a small family. We even emailed their reservation desk a few days before to check they had the request (which they had). Got to check in and told no connecting rooms available. Argued with front of house staff until mysteriously connecting rooms were found. This shook my faith in the hotel as usually if you request and then check they got the request hotels usually manage it. Suspect that very little care is taken on special requests, so families beware! Once we arrived in the room the connecting doors were locked. Phoned reception and no one answered. Tried again and rung for a long time and still no answer. This was the first time I have ever been in a hotel and had reception not answer the phone. Phoned house keeping, who answered after a reasonable time who sent someone up who didn't have the key. Said he would come back and didn't. Phoned again and no one came again. Eventually after we went down to the reception desk, they managed to get someone to unlock it. This was hours after we had arrived in our room and we thought was just terrible service. Whilst the rooms were quiet from aircraft noise the phones in the rooms mysteriously rang at various times in the night and early morning with no-one ever there. Ended up having to unplug them as they had no 'do not disturb' feature. Staff also entered our room one evening past 11pm to 'help us check out' (which we weren't until the next day). They knocked only as they unlocked and opened the door and arrived in the room before we could even get near the door. Thank heaven we weren't in any kind of compromising position! We will never be leaving the chain off a hotel door again. Staff repeated the same at 9am to see if we wanted the room cleaned even though we were checking out two hours later. We thought barging into the room without knocking and waiting for an answer first was extremely bad practice. Lots of other things let the hotel down. The safe in one room didn't work (didn't bother reporting it as it took four calls and over five hours to get them to manage something simple like unlock a connecting door). Toilet also constantly running in one of the bedrooms (fixed that myself as again easier than phoning them). The ironing board collapsed when you actually tried to iron on it. All the bathroon floors were extremely slippery. I fell three times in our bathroom despite trying to be careful and the lobby toilets with the same flooring permanently had a wet floor warning board up even though the floor was dry so it is clearly a known problem. Has a really odd childrens playground which has just three plastic climbing things in it, which are in full sun and are so hot they are untouchable by 11am. Nice idea, but like many things in the hotel, poor delivery. On a postive side the concierge were really good and efficent. Answered the phone in about three rings, did what you asked quickly and pleasantly and efficently. Maybe they should be running the hotel? Spa staff also nice (but oddly never ask if you would like a locker key even though it it obvious you need one), pool nice. Beds were also comfy. So apart from the location and concierge, the hotel really isn't worth staying at. The hotel could be really good, but the delivery of most aspects lets it down. We had a dreadful time.

Overall, this hotel was perfect to rest and refresh ready for our continued journey with our 2 young children. I would highly recommend staying here if you are stuck in HK for several hours waiting for a connection. Good points - excellent location: only a short walk across an enclosed pedestrian bridge from the airport - you can see the hotel from the windows of the luggage hall; allow 30-45 mins to disembark from the plane, catch the train to the arrivals area in the terminal (this is easy - clearly signposted and trains run every 2-3 mins), clear immigration, and walk to the hotel (this was easy enough for us to do, even with 2 young kids in tow) - great health spa - can book a massage/treatment before or on arrival - my masseuse was excellent! - pleasant poolside area with excellent changerooms - quiet rooms (we had a room overlooking the runway with no external noise whatsoever) - regal club room came with free internet access A few annoyances: - variable staff - the health spa staff were very helpful, the reception was a little hit & miss - despite requesting a 7am check-in at the time of booking our room was still not ready when we finally arrived at 9am after our flight was delayed (they did however supply us with a free buffet breakfast voucher which we enjoyed) - priority check-in ignored - we had also booked a Regal Club room with priority check-in - I had to wait at the priority check-in counter on two separate occasions with different staff where I presented to see if our room was ready yet, whilst several people that arrived after me at the standard check-in counter were served first! - uninspiring rooms with bland decor - we booked a regal club room which was very standard in its presentation (so much so that I rang the assistant manager when we arrived to confirm if we were actually in a regal club room); however, it was comfortable enough, clean and the bathroom was nicely refurbished and well stocked with necessary toiletries - corridors in our wing smelt like guests have previously smoked there, even if not presently allowed - I was much relieved to find the room was odour free though - regal club room comes with club access with free refreshments, but we discovered when we arrived that we couldn't use it because children are not allowed Overall, if you are transiting through HK with several hours between connecting flights then I would definitely recommend staying here.

The hotel is adjacent to the airport and we took our airport baggage carts over the walkway right up to the bellhops in the hotel. That made things so much easier than if we had to catch a shuttle to another airport, only to do the reverse the next day. It amazed me how different the feeling was between mainland China and Hong Kong even though we'd only gone about 100 miles. The staff had on Hawaiian shirts and the mood in the hotel reminded me of the attitude at the Hyatt on Maui-elegant and relaxed at the same time. The room was one of the most comfortable Chinese rooms I've been in (I've stayed in 8 Chinese hotels so far for a total of about 4 weeks during my 2 trips). I woke up more rested than I expected and we headed down for our breakfast. The breakfast area was quite nice. Being next to the airport we didn't have to rush to get our stuff ready for our flight. Getting through all the lines and to the gate is a pain, but that's true on almost any international flight. Our stay was part of a package so it's hard for me to comment on the prices as well as I can the room. I recommend this hotel particularly for anyone concerned about making connections at the airport. That part was very convenient. I'm irritated that I've been to the Hong Kong airport twice but I've never been able to leave the premises. Family members have been to Hong Kong and enjoyed it. We want to go for real, and not just to get a connecting flight, esp. to see Hong Kong Disney. I'd like to stay at this hotel when we finally do go there. True, I can't say that I used many of the hotel's services and, granted, we were there for only one quick night, but we were both impressed and-assuming money is not an issue for us-I'd like to come back.

The service was generally very good, yes there were some not so good days where service was slow, but over the course of the stay these were few and far between. The room was comfortable and well equiped with amenities and the cleaning was good although I found the TV channel selection limited for my liking. They did have Discovery Channel, National Geographic a film channel as well as news channels in different languages but no music channels. If you like a bath then the baths are a bit low but the shower was very powerful. Laundry was OK and reliable and as we were long stayers we were able to use the pound wash rather than dry cleaning. The pound wash was basic and a lot cheaper but did the job however a few items ended up smaller as a result. As we had got to know the Head Chef Will he was keen to cook 'off menu' meals for us including cornish pasties, sausage and mash, yorkshire puddings and he was always ready to tackle any cooking request. The bar food menu over the period we were there never changed and was limited but the quality of the food was always good but the steaks could be expensive. There are a good variety of restaurants to eat in including a Japanese restaurant, Chinese and a buffet restaurant, the only one I tried was the buffet and that had a good selection of dishes. The hotel always had something going on for special occassions like Valentines Day, New Years Eve and Chinese New Year. The New Years Eve's event was very good including a band Location was very good for the airport and Asia World Expo (10 mins walk away) but at least 20 mins fast train ride from Hong Kong Island and downtown but the return train trip is only about 100HK Dollars, roughly \u00a39. Asia World Expo hosted some big concerts during our period in Hong Kong.

We checked in late (23:00) from a flight, being a very seasoned business and holiday traveller, this time to check in always will indicate the level of service to come and how well things are run. Well the concierge met us at the door and took our bags immediately (we walked over from the terminal- 5 mins) , then directed us to a well manned reception desk. I had called in the reservation 12 hours earlier without credit card for security , they had the reservation, checked us in under 3 mins, spoke excellent English (everyone did) and had the bags up to us under 5 mins. This is high standard for any hotel and very good considering the time of night. The rooms are very modern with LCD, cable TV, Internet wired and wireless, room size is double what a Sheraton or Marriott gives you in other countries. They have a work station, large King sized bed that was so comfortable after a long trip. The bathroom was very modern and clean and a great shower with plenty of hot water. Towels and Linen in the room are high quality (think Westin). The mini bar is basically stocked and the aircon a tad too cool so we shut it off. There are extra blankets available in cupboard as well as the customary safe. The windows in the room are extra well insulated against noise and you would not know you are by the airport. We are only staying 16 hours before moving on but do note that they rent their rooms on a 24 hours basis, meaning your rate is for 24 hours from check-in. Very handy for lay-overs at odd times.

We have mixed feelings about this hotel. The positive being is the location to the airport, basically you just walk from customs through the airport to the hotel. It takes approx 6 minutes. Just follow the signs. The negative \u2013 something always goes wrong\u2026\u2026. Check-in. - Check in went very smoothly and we were allocated to our room 6161 which was prepaid on the internet. My husband gave reception his credit card and preferred member card when checking in\u2026.unknown to us at the time the staff member had not swiped his credit card. Room - Our room was spacious and extremely comfortable., it consisted of a king size bed, dining suite, small settee, coffee table, working desk with internet connection. Bathroom \u2013 The bathroom was normal size with a shower over the bath. Toiletries were generously supplied. Staff and service \u2013 This is when our trouble and the negativity begins, on arriving into our room we started to undress for a much needed shower, two maids just walked in without knocking and calmly checked our mini bar. (so we thought)\u2026 only to find later they had actually locked the mini bar\u2026 we rang reception to get it unlocked\u2026which took about 3 phone calls to get some action. When opened our mini bar had no alcohol in it , so we just decided to head downstairs for dinner in the Chinese restaurant. The staff were incredibly slow and we waited at least forty minutes before getting served. Our problem then became obvious when our bill arrived, we were not allowed to charge it to our room\u2026\u2026evidently the problems all related back to check-in\u2026staff not swiping our credit card\u2026so we were treated like thieves.(hence the locked mini bar). My husband was furious and lashed out at reception\u2026.the manager then kindly suggested we could have a free breakfast......but hubby was so incensed, and livid for being treated like a thief\u2026nothing would have made him happy. Overall \u2013 This hotel serves a purpose and it\u2019s a great stopover hotel with some fabulous facilities like the outdoor/ indoor swimming pool, restaurants and bars. Its just a pity that every time we have stayed here there is always an annoying problem. It would be nice once to have a hassle free stay, than having to say\u2026. \u201chere we go again\u201d\u2026 RETURN STAY - We booked a suite this time with a fab rate through their hotel site.Our suite 6127 is enormous with separate lounge room with a dining suite, plasma TV, working desk, coffee table, and lounge suite. Our separate bedroom again is enormous with a king size bed, dressing table, plasma TV, walkin wardrobe, and separate dressing room. Bathroom- walk-in shower, bath and excellent tolietries.

Rooms are nicely appointed and have standard luxury amenities: wired and wireless Internet access, wide screen TV, high-grade bedding, linens and towels, bathrobes, name-brand toiletries, French-press coffee, mini-bar, in-room safe, ironing board, etc. Good working desk space and comfortable sofa. There is ongoing renovation in the hotel (no noticeable disruption to my stay) and I suspect my room may have been recently refurbished (the all-white upholstery was spotless). Rooms have double-thick windows with a nearly 12-inch air pocket, which seems to effectively buffer any noise from the airport (I was on the runway side of the hotel overlooking the terminal). Lights and air conditioning are controlled by inserting the room card in an actuator, so the room was hot when I arrived (an apparent energy saving measure) but quickly cooled down. Lights and AC are all adjusted from a single bedside control panel. Didn\u2019t avail myself of the restaurants on this short stay, but room service was speedy and the food hot. At check-in, the staff warned me that there would be a celebration beginning at 10 o\u2019clock for some of the hotel staff on the 11th floor and inquired whether I would need a room further away from the festivities.

I had gotten a good (HKD2000) rate, although I\u2019ve paid as low as HKD1600 before. I asked for a tarmac view room, but they did not have any. The young man at check-in then pronounced that he had upgraded me to the Executive Floor. What he SHOULD have said was that he was putting me on the 11th Floor, without Lounge access. It was a little embarrassing heading into the lounge, having my room number checked on the computer, and then being escorted back out. I did speak to a manager about this, and suggested they work on clarity and careful use of terminology\u2026 There\u2019s a couple of restaurants in the hotel, but they\u2019re pretty generic hotel issue. One of them is, though, 7x24, so you can get coffee in the very early hours. However, there\u2019s about four good eateries back in the landside part of Terminal 1, and a bunch of new restaurants over in T2 (which just opened, but is a bit of a hike from the Regal). The T1 restaurants are closer, and are located on a loft space above and just past the ticketing area. They include Grappa\u2019s, one of my favourite Italian restaurants in this part of the world. Rooms here are smallish, but for a transit hotel, they\u2019re fine. Comfy bed and feather pillows. I was impressed this time, as they have L\u2019Occitane toiletries\u2026 maybe that\u2019s because I was on the Executive Floor\u2026 don\u2019t recall that from prior stays. Didn\u2019t try the internet, as the airport itself has free wifi throughout. Check-out is an issue at this property, and it\u2019s irritated me before. There is no room bill under the door in the morning (and no newspaper either!), so you and your bags have to stand in line to check out. In all fairness, they did have six people working check-outs, but I don\u2019t understand why they can\u2019t have kiosks like some hotels, or at least drop a bill and let us run. I burned through 20 minutes waiting with all the other suits to get checked out. Given the distance into town, this is an excellent alternative to schlepping into Kowloon or Central if you\u2019re only transiting.
