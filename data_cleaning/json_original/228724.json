My room was located on the side of the little street that the hotel entrance is off and directly opposite the little cafe. In the evening there are a lot of people outside the cafe so you might find it a little noisy. The cafe plays live music and because i was so close i could hear it loud and clear. I actually really enjoyed this but some people may not. The hotel was located right near Grand Boulevards metro station but is walking distance to Notre Dame (about 20 minutes), Marais and the Louvre. There are lots of nice restaraunts and shops near it. I was travelling by myself and felt safe in the area. I did catch taxis back to the hotel late at night but generally it was fine. One thing i was disappointed in was that the breakfast was the same everyday. A croissant, baguette and cheese.

This was our 3rd time in Paris. Previous 2 times I could say that those hotels were small. This hotel was even smaller, especially the shower/bathroom ! Hardly any room to move around. The hotel is located in a courtyard off the street with about 5 or 6 other hotels surrounding it. The main corner, there is a shoe store on one side and a crepe wondow on the other. The entrance ( walkway to the courtyard) has the name of another hotel on the top. Right across the street is Restaurant Cartier. There is a bar right in front of the hotel, but it closed pretty early so the noise that kept us up at night was drunk people who would walk through the alley and either be arguing with someone or just screaming for no reason. We had to keep the window open because there was no air conditioning in the room. So its either be woken up to sleep with a breeze or have no noise whatsoever but be very warm. The TV in the room has only 1 english channel but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t care because as soon as we got up we went out for the day and we were so tired when we got back that we went straight to bed. The room was clean however and daily maid service was good. There was also breakfast in the morning. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think north American bacon and eggs but traditional French breakfast of baguette, some butter, piece of cheese, yogurt, juices milk and coffee. Very nice snack and refueling before the day to start. One more bonus of the hotel is that it has free wireless. When using your device, it will ask for username and password. Just ask the front desk that you want to use wireless and they will print out a receipt with a username and password to use good for 24 hours, so every day just ask for a new one. So that is the hotel. I would give it 3 out of 5. no real complaints, we expected it and it was our 3rd time here so didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have high expectations, but if this was my first time visiting or coming for a special occasion I would definitely shell out some more money to stay somewhere bigger etc.. if your not picky and just need a place to crash, its perfect. The area itself is convenient. 2 minute walk to the Metro Grand Boulevards which is on Line 8 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Purple. This line goes to the major attractions like invalids, ecole militaire ( Eiffel) etc.. but it also connects to other lines which you would use to visit the main sites. The surrounding area itself is pretty lively as well. When you get out on the main street and you head left ( i./e towards Bonelle station), take one of the main streets here down to St.Eustache. the area around that church is full of little bars and pubs it was so nice. Or you could simply take a 10-15 minute walk to the Opera or 2 metro stops. We walked with our luggage from the Roissy bus stop outside opera to the hotel and it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a problem since it was big sidewalks. We took the metro back to roissy stop when leaving only because we had no time but it was rush hour and it was a disaster trying to get on with luggage so we should have just walked it.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winthrop, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cGreat Affordable Option in Paris\u201d", "Author": "GigHarmon", "ReviewID": "UR114875038", "Content": "We decided to extend our trip to Paris by one day and found a really great rate for this hotel online.

Clean, quiet area, pleasant management. It is close to Mus\u00c3\u00a9e Tussauds and not too far from the Opera. The area is not the best in Paris (next to GRAND BOULEVARDS metro station and a lot of restaurants) but this is reflected in the price anyway. It is location in an inside streed with very low trafic and with many hotels (because of this, it could be difficult to find the first time, so use a map if first time in Paris as it is kind of an inside court/ and again not in a main street !!!), so this is already a good point as you will not be disturbed by any street noise. Just note that there is no airconditioning in the rooms, no fridge and no safe, so if this is important for you, i would stay somewhere else. Cannot talk about the breakfast as it was not included in my reservation.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rotorua, New Zealand", "Title": "\u201cClean and quiet hotel near Metro.

Having said that, as it's in a quiet pedestrianised street it was not noisy at all and we managed to get 2 great night sleeps.
