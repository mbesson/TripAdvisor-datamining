{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very nice hotel We went to Frankfurt for a family vacation with two kids and a granny! Family room and single room was next door to eachother, very handy! The family room had a kitchenette with a small fridge and a sink. There was a supermarked just down the road. Good for those in-between meals for the kids. There was some nice restaurants in the area as well. The hotel doesn't have an elevator, so if your legs aren't very good make sure to get a downstairs room. The hotel is in Heddernheim, a suburb of Frankfurt and a quiet area. The U-bahn is not far away, so no problems moving around without a car. Friendly staff helped out with every question we could come up with.There is a small car park at the back, but we did't have to look far when this was filled up.", "Date": "Aug 14, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR624685612", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "Nullet"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d666920-r8421324-Hotel_Heddernheimer_Hof-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "666920", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
