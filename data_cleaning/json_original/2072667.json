Alba from guest relations was a credit to the hotel ,she helped organise a bottle of champagne to be in the room and notified me when football tickets had been delivered to the hotel.She couldn't have done enough to help.The junior staff at reception were very friendly and always smiling,the senior people on reception should learn to smile more and not be so serious. In summary a perfect location and very comfortable accommodation", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Happisburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Five Star bolt hole in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Happisburghlandlady", "ReviewID": "UR127473567", "Content": "We spent three nights in Majestic Residence in Barcelona in February. The appartment was of a very high standard as one would expect from the Majestic and it was extremely good value - one can use the facilities of the main Majestic Hotel over the road with its swimming pool looking across to the Sagradia Familia. It is also in an excellent location so we walked everywhere. We had a wonderful balcony with sun beds and were blessed with wonderful weather so made full use of the balcony and as it was at the back of the building it was very quiet. We would thoroughly recommend it to friends and family and would certainly stay there on a return visit to Barcelona.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kansas City, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat apartment for families\u201d", "Author": "scott10s", "ReviewID": "UR126840358", "Content": "We stayed at the Majestic apartments in March.

The apartment block is across the road from the Majestic Hotel which owns the flats and you have full access to the Hotel facilities. The apartments are in the centre of the buy shopping and restaurant avenue the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, only minutes walk from several Gaudi Houses and the Ramblas. The apartment was very well furnished in a modern but comfortable style. The small but well equipped kitchen was great for making a breakfast. This allowed us to go to the local market, and buy the fantastic hams, fruit and bread which is something I always want to do on holiday but never have anywhere to prepare the food. There was a Nespressos machine, so we had endless cups of good coffee. The large amount of space was great for relaxing and we had a balcony which over looked the peaceful back gardens of the restaurants and shops. When in the apartment you felt that you had left the nosey hustle and bustle of the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, but once you were rested and ready to go out, you were straight back into this vibrant part of town. We made good use of the Hotel bar which was on the roof and had spectacular views of Barcelona which seemed to glitter in the mmon light. A relaxing but luxurious place to stay.", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cNicest place I've stayed in Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "WBreskin", "ReviewID": "UR121523737", "Content": "I've been to Barcelona several times, and this was by far the nicest place we have stayed (including the Meridian, which was very nice).

At first, I was leery about staying in the Residences (as it is across the street from the actual hotel). I could not have been more pleased with my decision to stay in the Residences. These are great apartments. I had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a full kitchen and living room and dining room. It was tastefully decorated and I felt as though I were a true resident of Barcelona. The apartment could easily hold 4-6 people. The hotel itself is beautiful, a great location\u2026close to high-end shopping, great restaurants, etc. But, to me, what makes this hotel so awesome is the staff. Everyone was so friendly, specifically, Isidro is terrific (and so are Tim and Angel). I will definitely be back to this property for sure. If you stay at the Residences, be prepared that daily maid service costs extra (if you want it). And you many need to go out and buy dish and laundry soap (but, it is no big deal).

There are black out shutters, so we slept til 11am the first morning. The cost was equivalent to 2 rooms in the hotel and it was a much better deal. There are great restaurants in the neighborhood and excellent shopping. Right next door there was a very good Tapas restaurant / bar. Perfect neighborhood.
