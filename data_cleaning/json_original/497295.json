I had booked an apartment of 1 bedroom for 5 days through the internet online, which included complimentary breakfast and airport pickup and drop. We were greeted by the chauffeur at the airport on time and very cozily dropped at the hotel. The first surprise was that I was upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment which was huge and very clean. The air condition was so strong that we had to switch it off most of the time in the nights, absolutely the opposite of what I had heard.

I faced the following problems: 1 - The couches were stained and dirty. They were in fact, so dirty that I could not bring myself to sit on them (I have pictures to prove it) 2- First night I was there, I noticed my room did not have towels. I asked the front-desk to send up some since I wanted to take a shower before I turned in for the night. An hour after I called, no towels. I called them again, and they said all the towels were in the laundry, they were waiting to receive the clean ones. Ultimately, I went to bed, and called them up again in the morning, and asked them to send up the towels. The front-office guy thought it was okay to slam down the phone without saying \"yes\" or \"no\", but the towels did show up in 10 minutes. 3- The bathroom floor had bugs. Yup, a number of itty bitty dead insects. I think they died from the trauma of being in that little dirty bathroom. 4- The hotel promises a fully equipped kitchen, and a washing machine. Guess what, the kitchen was not equipped with anything other than a kitchen table, and there was an open drain in the kitchen (which solved the mystery of where the insects came from). 5- There was probably a washing machine in the room above mine, which was, for some reason, being operated at 2 in the morning. The rumbling kept me awake that night. 6- The corridor stank. 7- It was impossible to get a cellphone signal, unless I was half hanging out of the window. This was not the fault of the telecom service provider - because it was not possible to get a signal for either of the two UAE operators (Etisalat and Du). In all fairness, this is something the hotel probably cannot help. So there you go. Unless your other option is sleeping on the street, try and avoid this hotel.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ahmedabad, India", "Title": "\u201cGood Property In the Middle of The Dubai......

London Crown 1 is located near to the four points sheraton hotel and the standard chartered bank off al mankhool road. London crown 2(the bad one) is located in bank street area(some 50 mtrs off the main street), near burjuman center. And if I am correct London crown 1 has 2BHK & 3BHK rooms while London crown 2 has studio & 1bhk rooms Now to the review of London Crown \"1\" Location : It is located in a quiet residential area off al mankool road, behind standard chartered bank. Its at a walkable distance(max 10mins) to departmental stores like spinneys and choitram , couple of decent malls,electronic shops like Jumbo and also apple store, a few nice restaurants(including KFC and Mcdonalds), and some pubs . And if you dont mind walking a bit more, then you could be in the awesome Mina bazaar after a leisurely walk of about 20 mins. And there is a convenient store right opposite to the hotel for all the daily requirements. Rooms: Well, when I walked in the room for the first time, my first words were - 'wow, thats big!'..I stayed in a 2 bhk room along with one of my office collegue. The living room was big with a LCD tv, comfy sofa set, and a dining table. The fabric of sofa set did look like it needed some urgent fresh fabric upgrade. The bedrooms had divinely comfortable queen sized double beds, CRT TVs and good storage arrangements. There were 2 bathrooms, one had a bathtub, while the other a separate shower area. Decent sized, simple, and clean. The room service did a great job daily to keep everything neat and clean. All in all rooms werespacious and clean, but the furnishings were relly outdated. Service: At times the room service was prompt and at times it gave me headaches. On my first night I asked them to give me a wakeup call at 6am as I had an important meeting..The next morning no one bothered to give me a call! Fortunately my cellphone alarm went off at 7 am , so I was only an hour late on my first day. One of the lady, who seemed to be from philippines, had a tough time comprehending english.Either they misunderstood what I wanted and brought something else, or they forgot it all together. Food: The chicken club sandwich for 23Dirhams was absolutely awesome.. I ordered it more than 20 times for about 45 days I stayed there ! The food was good, but it took really long to deliver. Sometimes it took more than an hour.There was a nice restaurant called Grand restaurant opposite to the hotel building, which served even better food (Indian, Chinese and continental) at about half the price!! We ate our dinner there almost every other day.Or you can always wander outside where there are many good lebanese, indian,continental and chinese restaurants. I didnt have to pay for my month and half stay here as I was on official business trip.I learnt however that it cost 800 Dhm per day /per room for my company..a little pricey I think taking into account the not-so-good service and outdated furnishings.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "delhi", "Title": "\u201ca family hotel\u201d", "Author": "spml50093", "ReviewID": "UR30046480", "Content": "a good hotel with good romms and above all a great location", "Date": "May 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Middle East", "Title": "\u201cStay somewhere else!!\u201d", "Author": "luckyduck13", "ReviewID": "UR10833464", "Content": "Bad smells in rooms when we arrived.

London Crown 1 is actually further away from the Bur Juman Centre, still walkable, but a block or so behind the Ramada Hotel. Of the two, London Crown 1 is by far the superior. I know this because a mix up in booking in March forced me to move from LC2 to LC1, which is more expensive but it is well worth the extra money. London Crown 1 is located on a much quieter street, a ten minute walk from the shopping mall. The apartments are much bigger, much better maintained and much more luxurious. The kitchens are better equipped, but still with utensils missing. (Get used to it! This is such a common problem in Dubai's serviced apartments) There is a pool and nice little cafe for meals. . London Crown 2 does indeed have rather grotty studios with bad TV reception, appalling bathrooms and very poorly equipped kitchens.

The lay out of the studio flat was marvelous\u2026 very cozy and big, consisting of a nice table next to the window at which one can enjoy a romantic meal and a comfortable, plush sofa to relax in while sipping drinks and a queen size bed that was indeed very warm and inviting. The kitchen was opening out towards the bedroom and thankfully there was a door closing the kitchen compartment from the bedroom/living area so \u201cwhen you walk out of your flat no you don\u2019t smell of the food you just cooked!\u201d The kitchen however can do a bit better with more equipment and it would have been nice if bottles of drinking water were provided so that the guests don\u2019t have to go out the day you check in itself just to buy some water to drink. The breakfast was fantastic.. There was a spread of Western and Indian cuisine and it was scrumptious. Spending a couple of days at the London Crown and having breakfast at the same place we were skeptical as to whether we will be bored with the breakfast if it was the same thing, from the same place day in and day out, but it was not the case and we did not tire of the breakfast at all\u2026 it was simply wonderful and we really looked forward to it. The front desk staff could have been a bit more polite especially when it came to the complimentary airport transfer, which should be understood is something that the guest does not have to worry about.
