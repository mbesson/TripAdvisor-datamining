It has a very nice kitchen, which we were free to use for meals. We prepared breakfast there every day, and stored our food in the fridges available. The room was excellent: we got a mezzanine room. The bathroom was spectacular: small, but with a very powerful shower! It is in a very friendly neighbourhood, with plenty of little shops and very good restaurants, where locals go to eat. Every night, there were prostitutes on the street, and there is a strip bar across the road (right next to the cash machine), but neither detracted from the cosy feeling of the neighbourhood. We highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "JenniferBehan", "ReviewID": "UR127937075", "Content": "We stayed in a private room in this hotel.

Obviously very recently renovated, the rooms and sheets were clean, and the bathroom was fantastic. The room had lockers for each person staying in there, which needed your own lock. Mine was unfortunately too small, so be careful about that if you do like to keep your things locked away. The packed lunch they provide for 4euros was excellent value for money, and the breakfast was nice and convenient, much cheaper than other places in the area. Honestly one of the nicest hostels I've stayed in, definitely felt more like a hotel than a hostel. Location was excellent aswell.

Hotel is either new or newly renovated. Stylish furnishing. One can really see that the interior was thought through carefully. Bathroom: clean and stylish as everything else, but quite cold. So the towels weren\u2019t dry in the morning. BUT: - For some reason I was asked to pay beforehand. We were staying just for three nights, so it didn\u2019t bother me much at the moment. - The double room was incredibly small: there were two beds (put together to make it a double bed), one sofa (Danish design, good looking) and a tiny rack, where we could only put our coats. There was no place to put our suitcases, so they blocked half the space. All our clothes covered the beautiful design sofa, never giving us a chance to sit on it. For three days we could take it. But I can\u2019t imagine staying there longer. - Breakfast: useless way to spend your 5 euro. So called juice made from some powder - tasted very chemical and too sweet to be real. I found it much more enjoyable to have my breakfast in a caf\u00e9 not far from the hotel. Besides, breakfast in Meininger lasts until 10 a.m. \u2013 and that\u2019s way too early! - Checking out: they have an early check out at 10 a.m. But there\u2019s an option to prolong your stay for 5 euro \u2013 so was written in the hotel card they give you. But it turned out, that it\u2019s not 5 euro per room, but 5 euro per person. It\u2019s not the kind of money to go grumble about, but I at that point I was just too tired of this attitude: \u201cWe are such a great place to stay! Yoo-hoo! We are the best!\u201d and then they just charge you for every little thing\u2026 I mean, you\u2019re either a cheap hostel-like thing or a \u201cdesign hotel in cool location\u201d. And once you call yourself a design hotel, I expect not to be charged for some rubbish every single time.

On the first night of our stay at about 11:30 we were awakened by knocking. The door opened before we could get dressed, so we had to confront two guys in our underwear. One said he was staff (though he wore no uniform or tag), the other guy was a guest who had stayed in the room the night before and had locked some belongings in a locker in the room -- he wanted them back. After arguing with them for a while, we let the guy take his stuff and leave. The staff guy was apologetic, but indicated he had no choice. The episode was so weird we sat for a while wondering if it had been some sort of scam, but I don't think it was -- it was an awkward situation that was terribly handled by the hotel staff. Besides this late-night episode, we noted that the staff was very rude, like they normally deal with stag party groups and testy bargain travelers. We found the room very uncomfortable -- it was poorly ventilated. The evenings were cool, but the room stayed about 82F (I had a thermometer). We could only crack the windows a little by tilting them in, they had special locks to keep them from fully opening. The staff said this is a safety mechanism -- presumably to keep the drunken guests from tumbling out the windows. It was safe, but made us miserable. The hotel looks brand new with nice furnishings, but the mattresses were thin and lumpy. The bedding was not clean when we arrived.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milano, Italia", "Title": "\u201cNew and clean hotel, perfect for travellers!\u201d", "Author": "MattiaQuinteri", "ReviewID": "UR116942579", "Content": "A brand new hotel, opened just few months ago. It is in a very good location to visit the most interesting places of the city and to experience the nightlife in Berlin. I stayed there for 4 days with friends in a dorm room: the sheets were very clean, the bathroom modern, the room was cleaned up daily and the beds were quite comfortable. The only problem was that the room was located on the first floor in front of the street and the noise could be annoying. The atmosphere is lively and warm. The staff is young, kind and polite and this balances a little lack of experience. In the lobby you can use free wifi connection while you are sitting on couches and sofas, or pay to use the computers of the hotel. There is also a kitchen with all facilities, very useful to save money, and a courtyard. It's very easy to chat and meet people from the all world in these common places. To visit the city you can take the S-Bahn in the station in front of the hotel (Oranienburg Tor) and at night there are many pubs and restaurants. At night there are also prostitutes nearby, but they don't bother you at all. At last, the prices are cheap and the value is really good.
