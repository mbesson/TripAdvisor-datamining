I must say, such a room was PERFECT for what we needed (we had dreaded splitting up into 2 smaller rooms). The room was clean, basic and became a little home for 5 20 year old guys for a week. It was my first trip to Amsterdam, so finding the hotel was a little hard, yet after a few days the walk from the Hotel to the City (via the Van Gough museum and he museum district) became a pleasure rather than a chore. By no means is this hotel a Hilton or Marriot. It is VERY cheap and if you share the similar philosophy that cleanliness and friendly staff make up for what hotels like this lack, than you really should consider the Hotel Janson As you can imagine, being 5 \"lads\", we had gone to Amsterdam for hedonistic reasons rather than for the historical scenery, the small team of staff realised this and quickly told us about local Coffee shops and Bars. On several evenings we missed he curfew (i think midnight, but not sure) however the staff were always more than happy to let us back in after hours.

Firstly i must state this hostel is for backpackers or persons looking for an affordable stay in amsterdam ( an expensive city ). The hostel itself is easilly acessable by tram or bus and a taxi ride from dam square costs 25euros. the tram journey to the centre of amsterdam passes through liedsplein and rembrantplein both popular destinations for tourists providing areas to explore, shop or enjoy the vibrant nightlifre. the hostel itself is clean with decent facilities, the staff were always friendly and helpful with any queries or directions which was very useful. Remember the rooms are that of a hostel not a 5 star hotel so if you are accustomed to staying in hostel's you will find the accomodation suitable to accomodate your needs. I did not try the breakfast however the staff are happy for you to bring food and drink into the hostel and consume it in the communal area which provides a microwave, toaster and kettle.

We paid for a 4 bed room (There were 3 of us girls). When we arrived we had to pay them in cash and they then informed us that they had no room for us and then sent us off to a random hostel down the street. We arrived at the other hostel and walked into our room to find that our room had been switched from a 4 person to a 12 person bedroom and was filled with scary sketchy looking men. We were horrified and immediately went downstairs to fix the situation. They acknowledged that we booked a 4 person room but said that they merely didn't have any room for us, so they basically changed our reservation and screwed us out of a room just because they felt like it. We told them we were not comfortable staying there and that we wanted our money back for that night because that was not what we reserved or what they paid for. They refused to refund our money and acted as if it were no big deal. They told us to either stay in the dorm with the creepy men or to leave, so we left the hostel in the middle of the night in the rain to try and figure out where to stay that night. We were told to return the next morning to talk to the manager about the situation. We came back the next day and the man at the front desk claimed that he wasn't the manager, but we later found out he really was the manager and just lied to us to avoid dealing with the situation. He then was very rude to us and kept on screaming that we were not getting any money back. He was insulting us and yelling at us for wanting the money back. He claimed that they were not at fault for anything. We wanted to cancel our entire stay there but they didn't let us and when we spoke to Jansen Hostel, who originally sent us there, they wouldn't take responsibility or refund us our money either. THEY STOLE OUR MONEY and still have our cash even though we did not spend a single minute in the room. Aside from that, it was really dirty really sketchy really terrible wifi and HORRIBLE RUDE RUDE RUDE THIEVES running the place. They did not speak any english OR dutch, how are they allowed to run a hostel? Being here was a NIGHTMARE.

Noisy room- backed onto busy road. So hot/ stuffy/overcrowded that we had to sleep with window wide open. Breakfast ends at 8.30 which is awful if you're out the night before. Bathroom was at least fairly clean but rest of hostel was falling apart. Extremely steep stairs to get in so very much not suitable for less able travellers. I've stayed in lots of hostels of varying quality, and when you look at say the Wombat Hostel in Berlin which is like a simple hotel with lovely rooms and staff compared to this, there is no comparison!

'breakfast' was included, which comprised of cold coffee stale cereal and bread and cheese that had been left in the open.

This was by far and away the worst hotel I have ever stayed in, and I have been in lots of one star hotels in Amsterdam which were much better. The room we had was a single sized room that had been changed to a twin, presumably to make more money. The twin beds were not even a normal size, they had bought special extra narrow ones and pushed them together, in order to make a tiny amount of space to walk round the bed. There was no room to put our bags or possessions. The furniture provided just prevented us putting our bags anywhere. Strangely, the only useable space, in the corner, had a shower cubicle fitted, which looked grotty and I would never have used this. The shower door could only be partially opened onto the bed, if you were a heavy person you could not have got through the gap. The room had a fuzzy tv. Had this been wall mounted we could at least have put something down there. The window was massive with single glazing so very noisy from traffic. The grotty curtain covered about two thirds of the window and the rest had no covering. So very bright in the morning. The wc was down a flight of stairs and the toilet seat was broken. The whole place was really shabby and needed a lot of renovation. Peeling walls, dirty carpets, and diy jobs that needed doing such as radiators not fitted to walls. The breakfast was basic. Bread and cheese and cold coffee and juice. One of us had to eat in bed as there was nowhere else.

Read on if you want a full description of the hotel - WARNING - it is a long review. We arrived quite late and the receptionist, who was very friendly, said 'you have room 206, tomorrow you will be moving to room 310'. I asked why but he didn't have an explanation. When we saw the room we were very disappointed as the 'double bed' (two singles pushed together) was squashed against the outside wall, under an enormous drafty window and there was little space in the rest of the room. The wardrobe was a coat rack attached to the wall and a couple of coat hangers. This was really a single room. We found the bedding and the towels to be clean and the bathroom was clean with a separate shower which worked well. Having finally settled in the room we thought we'd go out and have a meal but be warned there is nothing open in the area after 10 p.mt. We now know that the number 5 tram goes right past the hotel and we could have been in the centre within 15 mins. however we weren't given this advice form the receptionist. It is a safe and quiet area very close to the museumsplein and has lots of student bike traffic to a nearby college. We were asked what we would like for breakfast, which could include brown or white bread, egg, ham 'chicken ham'?, and jam plus juice or coffee ( I did ask for both and the guy agreed but just brought one coffee and one juice between us). Toast wasn't offered just slices of bread. We packed in the morning for the move to room 310 but when we came back in the evening the new receptionist said 'Maybe tomorrow' . I asked why we were expected to move and he admitted that our room was 'a bit small\". Needless to say we were not moved on what would be our last night and after reading the French peoples' references all I can think is that it was a way of preventing us from considering moving hotels. This was not an option as 'easy to book' had already got our credit card details and could charge us anyway, which is what happened to the French couple. We didn't bother with a breakfast on the second day but having noticed a toaster asked if our bread could be toasted on our final day. He said 'Of course' but when it came it had been put in a toaster but it was still white'. Maybe it's a cultural thing but in most places in the world toast is done until it turns brown. Finally on payment the receptionist had great difficulty in getting our credit card to work until my wife who works with these things on a daily basis guided him through the process of entering it manually - I know the website says they prefer cash but it's our choice and I can't help thinking he didn't press the right keys to make it work.

The shower was right next to the bed - very hard to imagine but they somehow manged to fit it in. Once the windows were closed and the room was left vacant, the smell of damp became unbearable. The staff were also very rude. They have a rotating person at the front desk who basically runs the place, but it is obviously clear that none of the staff were adequately trained. They also failed to bring our breakfast to the room as they pointed out that we didnt put a time on the breakfast request form.
