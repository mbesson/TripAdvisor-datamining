{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Amazing Had an amazing time - hotel was full but never felt crowded.You are in the middle of no where and is very relaxing, I recommend doing the cookery lesson and the bike ride - you get an insight for how real bali is.Definitely get arranged transport to the hotel as it is difficult to find and down a bumpy track - it was a good 2 hours from denpasar airport (we had a bad run) but is was so worth the effort - also very good value. I looked at staying in the Hanging Gardens, it is actually on the other side of the hill and owned by the same person - reallly good value.Dvd player in room - most channels in German - lovely room - romantic paradise", "Date": "Oct 11, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR131502389", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Millie26"}, {"Content": "So Beautiful, but Far From Ubud Nandini Resort is a very beautiful resort set into the face of a river gorge, about 30 minutes drive out of Ubud proper.There are around 20 self-contained villas set into the hillside, on 4 levels with 3-4 per level. Each level is about 10 meters vertically above the next, with stairs to connect. There is also a little cable car to ferry you up and down if you don't feel like too many stairs.The villas themselves are just gorgeous, constructed of dark wood with a huge private bathroom. Each has a private balcony overlooking the river gorge and with views for miles over dense jungle. The bed has a gauze canopy suspended from the ceiling and is just beautiful. All the fittings appear brand new and very good quality. Bathroom was a delight with bath and shower, dressing area, and the shower even has a window to let you look at the jungle as you wash. There is a restaurant with quite nice food, a spa, and an infinity pool with timber decking, again with fantastic views. You're able to walk down 150 steps below the bottom level down to the river bank, which is again gorgeous. You can wade in the water or just rest in the kampong by the river and listen to the sounds of nature and nothing else, a pleasure after Kuta! Now the downside.... The resort is located 30 mins drive from Ubud, through winding streets, a small village, and finally a dirt road. It's really the middle of nowhere. So it's a hassle to get there and get back, and you will spend more on taxis than you expect. Some taxis also don't know where it is, keep the map on you. Hiring a taxi for the day (say 200,000Rp) is probably the best option, he can drive you around Ubud as well then.So if you're looking for a romantic getaway, or to see some of the most beautiful scenery you ever saw, and want to read and laze by the pool all day, this is perfect. But to see Ubud, there a more central locations you could choose which would work better.", "Date": "Apr 12, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR302639283", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MelbourneDave99"}, {"Content": "Natural yet isolated       Lovely pool2", "Date": "Nov 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR479908027", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ivanhoe2007"}, {"Content": "How to go to Ubud without staying at Aston Nandini Our 3 night stay at Aston Nandini in Ubud was one of our worst experience in Bali. Especially as we had the impression to have been stuck in an awful tourist price.Booking : we found the lowest price on hotels[...], for around 110 \u9227?per night inc breakfast. Standard price is published on hotel website around 300USD.Both prices are close to a theft for what hotel has to offer. It is in the same time out of Bali standards (often good value for money) and any reasonable price elsewhere.Location : this is where the whole story starts... Hotel is locate 20 to 30 minutes from Ubud center. It is really NOT in Ubud, and would say it is even not in Ubud area. it is in a very isolated vilage, where you have not chance to find transport to the city. Hotel offers transport to dowtown for RP 100.000. Having no choice, we chose this for the first day. We then agreed very easily with taxis in the street in Ubud on transport calendar and prices. Back and forth transport can be negotiated at RP 50.000, ie 4 times cheaper than hotel proposal.Room : extremely wet, feel as if you were outside. Bed liners and mosquito net were very dirty (blood, ...), towels as well. Any add about hotl refer to wonderful vally view. For the room we had (n\u63b34) and some we saw in the same neghbourhood, this is totally false : you have full view on the roof of the bungalow below. Pretty disappointing...Resort activities : strictly inexistant. As hotel has just opened, nothing is ready. Spa opens on demand only (external masseuse on request), and no sport activity is organised. We asked for activity list and prices. We were given, 2 days later, a list of walks and rides. Again, it was in average 4 to 5 times more expensive than any travel agency in Ubud (ex. : 25 USD per person per hour to rent a bike...)Restaurant : only positive experience at this hotel. Exquise staff, extremely attentive and helpful. Food is fresh, original, and reasonably priced.In a nusthell : offers all disadvantages from remote locations, without any of expected benefit.", "Date": "Sep 4, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR945659736", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Epigone"}, {"Content": "A little piece of paradise       Bed with mosquito-net", "Date": "Jul 12, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR710224299", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "happyQ"}, {"Content": "Preis-/Leistungsverhaeltnis stimmt nicht   showReview(19035374, 'full');", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR687073820", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Skarnagel"}, {"Content": "\u95c8\u6b0d\u4eb1\u9287\ue0a6\u4eb7\u9287\u65bb\u4eda\u9287\ue0a0\u4f05\u93c8\u20ac\u95ac?#x201d;   showReview(19171371, 'full');", "Date": "May 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR820119907", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}, {"Content": "ideal pour une escapade a 2   showReview(11664589, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR270998921", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297701-d603743-r20794369-Nandini_Bali_Resort_Spa_Ubud-Ubud_Bali.html", "HotelID": "603743", "Price": "$266"}}
