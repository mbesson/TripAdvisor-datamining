Our room was clean, comfortable and we slept very well. The hotel was busy from the Saints playing that weekend so we did occasionally hear some noise from people partying in the other rooms but it didn't affect our comfort and sleep. The French Quarter is an old place so we didn't expect it to be like newer construction hotels. Like others have said, the pool area is beautiful and a great place to hang out and have a drink from the bar. Darrell is an excellent, friendly bartender and we loved all of the drinks he made. The kind of service that makes you tip extra from the experience and great service. FYI: if you expect to park at the hotel their valet service is $35/night. Add that to your stay if you plan to use them. Tere are other parking choices nearby but we went with their valet for the convenience.

We arrived late afternoon and checked in fine. I had requested a smoking room although I intended to just smoke on the balcony as the person I was with was a non-smoker. I explained this to the lady on the front desk and she gave me a non-smoking room with a balcony so that was great. An ashtray was brought up to our room within 2 minutes. Please note the balconies are not private but this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a problem. I travel a lot and can honestly say that the beds and pillows were the most comfortable I have ever had. The cleaners were in everyday to make our beds, replace toiletries and clean, I cannot fault them. The staff were all very helpful and friendly and went out of their way to accommodate. They booked us in for trips and were always great at providing tips etc. We never went in the pool because it was always quite busy and we found it a lot smaller than the pictures portrayed but again, that wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really a problem for us. A very minor complaint - They have a computer by the front desk which you pay for. On one occasion it was so slow that by the time my 15 minutes were up, I hadn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t done anything. I mentioned this to the staff who gave me a number to call for me to be reimbursed. I personally do not feel that I should be calling to get my money back but I later found out that it is an external company who provide the internet service so I can understand why I was asked to do this. It did happen again later on in the week but the staff did everything they could to get it resolved asap. The TV had very limited channels which was a little disappointing. I know you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go away to watch the TV but I like to watch it while getting ready or if its been a long day/evening, I like to just chill with something good on the box which we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get. Again, this is something very minor. Our room was at the back of the hotel and very loud when out on the balcony (I love people watching so this wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t an issue), however, you could hardly hear a thing when the doors were closed so it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t disturb our sleep. The location was PERFECT. It couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have been nearer to all the restaurants, Bourbon Street, shops and water front. If you like to people watch like me, make sure you go to The Embers, Original Bourbon Inn and ask for a seat upstairs. The food is amazing and you get a great view of all the goings on. We went there three times and the food was delicious, make sure you try the meatballs! I would also recommend Olde Nawlins Cookery, Red Fish Grill, Palace Caf\u00c3\u00a9, D\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu and Mr B\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and The Gumbo Pot. Make sure you have a Hurricane cocktail while here (you can get them pretty much everywhere) For trips, I would definitely recommend the airboat swamp trip, its great fun. We went on the smaller boat but I am sure the bigger one was just as good. We did a two hour tour on the Mississippi River but we personally found that really boring, there really wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t anything of interest to look at. All in all this hotel was great. We paid a lot of money for it though and that is the only thing that would prevent me from staying here again which is a shame", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Hotel however very thin walls\u201d", "Author": "136DGP", "ReviewID": "UR135468609", "Content": "We spent one night at this hotel and thought it was a beautiful place.

We arrived to the hotel at 10 am so we were not allowed to check in but they did put our bags up so we could hit the quarter until it was time to get our room. When we came back it was packed and probably took us 30 to 45 minutes to get checked in which would have normally been very frustrating but the one gentleman that was trying to check all 20 people in was very nice and I had a very understanding buzz. Our room had 2 full size beds which seemed kind of strange with my 6'2\" husband having to sleep in a bed near me but it worked. The room was small but clean and nice. We were only there to sleep so it served its purpose. As I mentioned in the title the hotel has fantastic location. a quick 2 or 3 minute walk and you're on Bourbon St., another 10 and you're at Jackson Square, and a 5 minute walk towards Canal and you can catch a street car. Again, the room was just for us to sleep in so if you're looking for a hotel that you may have to do more then sleep and shower this is probably not the right hotel.

Most of our visits are with our relatives here, so we generally don't come during the really crazy times like Mardi Gras or Jazz Fest. The hotel rooms are what you'd expect from any other Holiday Inn -- comfortable, clean, with the standard amenities, including an in-room safe, which is for some reason harder to find in some hotels these days. There are a variety of rooms, since the hotel is made up of renovated 18th-century buildings and modern buildings, so some rooms have nice touches like balconies, or original brickwork. The central courtyard houses a small pool and chairs, which do fill up pretty quickly, but you probably didn't come to the French Quarter to spend the entire day in the pool. There is a restaurant which serves a full breakfast -- it's pretty standard American fare. It's good food, but if you're looking for some local flavor, you're going to be disappointed. There's also a lounge, and the bartender was very friendly. They have a concierge (a rare feature these days) who is very knowledgeable, and the valet and bell staff are happy to call you a cab if you need it. Valet parking will give you sticker shock if you're from somewhere other than New York or Boston, but it's pretty standard for the Quarter. The room rates are pricey, but not excessive for the location, which itself is quite good. 1 block to Bourbon, 2 blocks to Canal and the streetcars, and short walks to Jackson Square, the riverfront, the aquarium, and more.

The hotel's exterior blends nicely into the classic European architecture of the French Quarter. Of course, there are many choices of rooms and suites, and we loved our room. It had two beds and a balcony facing Bienville Street (See Tip #1 below). It was so serene...spending time on the balcony enjoying a glass of wine late at night or sipping coffee early in the morning; with a backdrop of seemingly never-changing historic architecture and a parade of ever-changing characters passing below, it's a great place for reflection and relaxation. Back inside, the room was adequately spacious, extremely comfortable, and met all our needs. There is a safe in the closet to protect your valuables. Tip #1 - When available, the hotel offers free upgrades to members of their great Priority Club frequent guest program who have accumulated enough points. We were thrilled to be offered this upgrade, even without asking. Tip #2 - Get their credit card, really! You get a free night at any of their hotels each year and lots and lots of points, which translate to additional free nights. You can't beat it. They waive the $49 fee the first year after which you can cancel, but even after that, the benefits greatly outweigh the fee. Tip #3 - It's just steps from three of the highest-rated restaurants in this culinary capital. Do try G.W. Fins for fresh seafood, excellently prepared. Do try Arnaud's for classic New Orleans dishes from a hundred years ago - very exquisite.

I didn't get to eat at the cafe inside the hotel, but I did look at the menu and there were a few things I wish I could have tried. Our room had a balcony that over looked Bienville Ave. I thought we were getting on on Dauphine St, but that's OK. I recommend this hotel, however, not at the price that I paid. It was the weekend of the NCAA Finals and with the tax and parking it was over $500! I think half that price is fair. The same room we had is about $100 when there are no special events in NOLA, which is about 1/2 the time! One other thing that wasn't up to snuff was that there is no assistance at night. I mean that we had spilt a glass of water on the bed and asked for a new set of sheets, we left for a hour, when we came back there was a pile of clean sheets on the chair. We had to change them ourselves. The best thing about this hotel is the parking. You will NEVER find a place to park in the Quarter ANYWHERE during a big event unless you pay. Even though the parking at the Lemoyne is $34, it is well worth it.

Also during our stay my friend left her prescription sunglasses in the lobby bathroom prior to us getting on a tour bus. She called the front desk to ask if someone could please get the glasses for her and hold them at the desk until we came back. After the rude desk agent put her on hold and \"disconnected\" her THREE times someone finally \"went to look\" and informed her they were not there. When we returned from the tour we decided to check the desk in case someone had turned in the glasses.

Now I should point out that it is very important if staying here to tell the cab driver that you want to go to Chateau Lemoyne, do no use the word Holiday Inn or you end up at another H.I. 13 blocks away on Royal St. I was told that the locals simply call it Chateau Lemoyne. We arrived early having come in from a cruise that morning and were told check-in was 4 pm which I more or less expected. We checked our bags and decided to grab breakfast at the little restaurant within the hotel that only serves breakfast. This is by far one of the worse places I have ever been to, not only was the food horrible but the service was the worst I have experienced. Upon entering, they don't have a sign or anything to tell you to wait to be seated or to just pick a seat. After waiting a few minutes we saw a waitress at other tables that didn't even have the courtesy to tell us to sit wherever we wanted. Finally after we were seated our waiter appears with menus and takes our order which he got half of it wrong. This may seem like a strange complaint but our food came way too fast, as in, it was already partially made but the eggs were severely under cooked. The waiter pretty much tossed our plates at us and muttered something that sounded like \"I have to go to the bathroom\" and ran out the door. Ten minutes later, we finally had to flag down the waitress waiting on the other tables to get another juice but then our waiter returned and got it for us, he brings it out immediately and said, \"Whew, I really had to go to the bathroom!\" now these are words anybody dining needs or wants to hear. Needless to say, we didn't drink the juice. The location is both good and bad. Good points are that you are in the French Quarter and you are a block over from Bourbon Street which means that is is a short walk but at night when it is loud (on the weekends) you can still hear the hootin' and howlerin' in your room. You are also very close to Saint Louis Cemetery #1. The bad side is that you are kind of on the outskirts of where most of the shopping and dining is, not far enough to need a cab but if you are someone that has limited range for walking this would prove to be a hike. It also is not very populated or well lit at night. The concierge desk is nice and helpful, we booked a tour with them that went really smooth. Often times the bellman was there and he was eager to give directions and recommendations for places to eat and things to do. There is also an armed guard on duty, not sure if this is common for the area or just this hotel but nonetheless makes one think. The check-in/out desk staff was void of personality and not at all friendly. The hotel could really use a remodel, desperately. The room was a nice size, we were on the 4th. floor with a balcony over the street. The room wasn't dirty but worn out, no lock on the bathroom door, shower curtain had some tears, and while they had a desk and a table in the room they chose the bathroom location for the in-room coffeemaker and as we all know, a breeding ground for germs. The French door that leads out to the balcony has two locks, a bolt into the floor and another into the ceiling which are not easily opened and if you are short you will have a hard time with the ceiling lock. Also the railing was falling apart with no attempt to repair, not a hazard but aesthetically not very pleasing. There are two elevators at the hotel and to be nice, I will say I am so glad I made it out of there and don't have to ride in them again. The one elevator on the right you could hear a cable banging up against the side of it which was not a very comforting sound, We had requested a late check out and they said they couldn't tell us anything until the morning of check-out and then they extended it a whole hour, wow! Considering the day before the maid didn't even make it to the room until after 3 pm which is humorous because there is a note on the Do Not Disturb sign that states that if you leave it on the door after 9 am or something like that, then your room won't be cleaned until after 2 pm. Maybe we should have put it out, she may have come sooner. Would I recommend this hotel?

We stayed for three nights. This is a very compact area of the city and the hotel is closely surrounded by other buildings. The only open exterior area is in the middle of the hotel surrounded on all four sides by the hotel itself. There is no self-parking. Valet parking at a fairly high daily cost ($35 at the time of writing) is offered. The reception area is smaller than many Holiday Inns but is nicely furnished. Our welcome from the staff was good, but there was only one person on duty at the time (a pattern that seemed to occur whenever we passed the desk), so we did have to wait for some time before we were attended to. Interior public areas are non-smoking. Smoking rooms are available. There is an outdoor pool in the central area mentioned above, and complimentary WiFi throughout. Despite the compact area of the city, rooms are very spacious, clean, and well maintained. In common with other hotels in the chain, the bed, in particular, was excellent. Some rooms do have a very restricted view. I noted a document behind the reception desk listing certain rooms that overlook a brick wall and an instruction to staff not to issue these to the chain\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s loyalty club members. Despite my membership, I did, indeed, get such a room. I understand the hotel has certain superior rooms, some of which have a balcony, but I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on these. Standard equipment including TV, coffee maker (more on that below), microwave, refrigerator, iron, hairdryer etc., were all present and correct. The hotel and rooms are air-conditioned throughout. The hotel was fairly busy whilst we were there and there was some noise penetration into the room from other guests. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s my preference to drink Hot Tea (rather than coffee) in my room. Despite the promise on the web site of a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153tea maker\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, I wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t at all surprised (given the country I was in) to find no tea bags in the room, so I called at reception who directed me to the restaurant. Staff there initially wanted to levy a charge for tea bags. Bearing in mind that we were paying around $130 per room per night (inc. taxes), and that I would not, of course, be using the supplied coffee, I felt this represented a very poor attitude. After some debate the waitress eventually generously gave me two (yes, TWO) tea bags for my three-night stay. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t dare ask for milk! (Powdered non-dairy creamer doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t make for a good cup of tea). Not good. I had to buy provisions from a nearby supermarket. There is a restaurant and bar. We did not take dinner nor breakfast so I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the standard of the food offering. In summary, this hotel represents a very good choice for both comfort and location and, if it weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for the question mark over the extent to which their general attitude honours the Holiday Inn promise to ensure everything needed for a good stay, and that very high charge for parking, I would be happy to recommend it.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, Texas", "Title": "\u201cReally enjoyed my stay\u201d", "Author": "HeavenAF", "ReviewID": "UR126500356", "Content": "The location was fantastic, just a few streets and a few minute walk from Bourbon street (which really comes in handy when you are coming back at night).

We found the service to be mediocre. The concierge was extremely helpful. We booked a tour through him with VIP City Tours and got a bit of a discount. My husband is not able to walk more than a couple blocks and the concierge suggested using pedi-cabs. This was a wonderful and helpful hint. It allowed my DH to see a lot of the French Quarter he would otherwise not have seen. The noise on Bourbon Street is LOUD. The hotel is amazingly quiet...what a difference just a block makes! Another nice amenity is free high-speed internet available in the rooms. I would highly recommend staying at Chateau LeMoyne.

Our room was fine, the bathroom a bit on the small side though. The beds were amazingly comfortable. We had no fridge or microwave but the small one-cup-at-at-time coffee dispenser was adequate. The hotel dining room/room service is only available for Breakfast but turn left out the front door for half a block and head for Deva-vu. It's open 24 hours and has an amazing menu for a dark little corner bar. The food was good and prices reasonable. If you want a place a little brighter, turn right out of the hotel for a block and try Nosh. The menu was smaller and a little more pricey but if you don't like the dive bar atmosphere this will be a better choice. The small coutyard/pool area was very nice. It was a great place to have a drink and dangle those tired feet in the pool after a long day. Yes - you can go pretty much anywhere with a drink in hand as long as it is in a plastic cup. If you want to spend a bit of quiet time with a drink and sports, I recommend the hotel bar. On Sundays and Mondays, Darrell is behind the bar and worth getting to know as a Louisana native. He's a blast to have on hand during Saints games! All the staff we interacted with were polite and effecient. Checkout is 11 am but we still had a couple of hours before we had to leave so they were able to lock up our luggage while we walked around and have a cab waiting for us when we returned. Very nice.

Not sure where the Concierge was at all times, but the desk staff was always there to answer questions and make suggestions. The hotel parking is $38 for the night and valet. There are $16 parking options nearby, if necessary. Free internet in your room. Major plus! No recycling. The room was clean. I've never seen a bed made so tight.

Tamica took pity on us waiting so long and gave us a room upgrade! the room was outstanding and we throughly enjoyed our stay. Also, we had a problem with one of the tours we took(VIP tours). Basically, they over sold the tour van and since we were the last to get on, VIP shoved us into the last row and this make it a very uncomfortable two hour tour of the city. Jeff, the tour scheduler at the hotel very much agreed with us and got some of our money back. Both Jeff and Tamica went the extra mile for us. That's what really helps to make a great vacation.

Now location is king in the French quarter and this works out fine, one block to Bourbon street a short stroll to the square or canal street and a myriad of great eating places are also within a short distance. If you are looking for a 5 star resort or a chain hotel feel this isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t for you. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique rough around the edges but so very New Orleans.

We have two boys, ages 9 and 15. I booked the hotel through a special advanced purchase price, and chose the option that included a balcony room facing Bienville. We arrived three hours prior to the 4:00 PM check-in time, but had zero issues checking in early. My husband was gone a mere five minutes before returning with a luggage cart. The valet promptly helped us unload our car and helped us to the elevator. We were not disappointed when we entered our room. We did indeed have a balcony in a room with two double beds, a table and chairs (pluse a table and two chairs on the balcony), flat panel TV, very large closet complete with safe and full size ironing board and iron. There was plenty of room for all of our luggage with lots of room to spare, and we didn't travel lightly. The bathroom was about average size, not huge, but not too small either. We had plenty of room to spread out all of our toiletries. The showerhead was very large, and the water pressure was great. The tub was a bit slow to drain, but it really wasn't an issue. I took very long showers during our stay and the water that accumulated in the tub during the shower never covered my feet. It wasn't a big deal at all. The beds were pretty comfortable, and while I did wish they were queen beds, we did absolutely fine with the doubles, even with my husband being a larger guy. The staff was very pleasant. The valet was always getting the door for us if he wasn't busy with cars. The front desk staff and the concierge were very nice and helpful. One night our kids were a bit bored after an early dinner, and they really went out of their way to offer suggestions and look for information. The cleaning staff was great, always smiling at us. They always left our room very clean. Every time we went to our room to get ready for dinner it smelled fresh, everything was clean, the powdered sugar all over the floor from our nightly beignets vacuumed, loads of fresh towels in the bathroom, coffee and cups restocked, etc. Even with a balcony room facing the corner of Dauphine and Bienville and being able to see Boubon from our balcony, the minute we closed our balcony door, the noise was virtually blocked out. We didn't notice much noice when we closed the balcony doors. The heated pool is a great plus if you have kids. Even though it was 40 degrees one evening, the pool was nice and warm, providing the kids with something fun to do at night. My husband and I even took a dip with them. The location is fantastic. It is literally one block from Bourbon St. and just a couple of blocks to Acme Oyster House, Oceana, Cafe Beignet, Nosh, Felix's. It's not a far walk at all to Jackson Square, the French Market, and everything else on Decatur. It's two blocks from Canal as well. We walked back to the hotel from the WWII Museum, and thoroughly enjoyed the walk. I can't say enough about how great the location is. I would definitely recommend the Chateau Lemoyne.

From the moment we arrived, we were impressed by the looks of the outside of the property, the amazing location, and the pool and garden areas. We were fortunate enough to meet Crystal, the receptionist at the front desk, at check-in. She was amazing \u00e2\u20ac\u201c pleasant, helpful, and smiling every time we saw her. She quickly found us a room with a Juliet balcony, facing the courtyard so we did not experience any street noise, and provided us with drink coupons for the bar. Over the next few days, she provided helpful and friendly suggestions about where to go and what to see, and answered our tourist questions with a smile. This girl deserves a raise! It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s so pleasant to be helped by an employee who clearly enjoys assisting her guests! Our room was spacious and comfortable, and housekeeping provided us with a small refrigerator upon request (\u00e2\u20ac\u0153first come, first served\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is the policy) at no charge. Guests have the option of requesting housekeeping after 2 p.m., which is a nice touch. The beds were extremely comfortable, with a good assortment of soft and firm pillows, and the bathroom was immaculately clean. Smoking rooms are available, and are well-ventilated, with windows that open. The heating/cooling system (we used both A/C and heat while we were there, as the temps dropped about 40 degrees in two days) worked well, with no noise. The hotel is located about a block and a half off Bourbon St. \u00e2\u20ac\u201c close enough to walk but far enough away to limit the noise \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and also within easy walking distance to Canal St. and the shops, Harrah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s, the Riverside Marketplace, and many many restaurants and shops.

After arriving 5 hours late we were greeted with a quick and efficient check in. We were giving our arm bands (Mardi Gras Pee Patrol) and directions to the room. Each room was equipped to handle wireless, however; it was free only in the lobby. We originally thought that we wanted to have a balcony facing the street (WRONG) and were a bit disappointed to find that we had the courtyard view, (THANK GOODNESS)! It was so quiet. I never heard any of our neighbors through the walls, I never heard other guest doors close and I never heard the housekeeping staff until they knocked on the door to see if we needed anything. We had 2 big beautiful French doors that overlooked a well groomed and maintained courtyard. We had 10 foot ceilings, a flat screen TV (NOT HDTV). We were given an accessible room, so we hard large entry doors, and lots of extra space. Trying to watch the weather channel (to make sure we were going to make it back home) there were a few satellite interruptions, but nothing major. The sheets were very clean, the towels and wash clothes in the bathroom were fresh! Small self serve coffee pot, alarm clock and iron w/board in the room. Basic necessities. If you would like a quick bite to eat to get your energy levels up, stop at Annette's Cafe just up the street from the hotel (Nothing Fancy - Just quick good food). She has a small menu with some local cuisine. Be sure to tell Miss Annie on the grill \"Rich says hello\"! The service is quick; the food is hot and tasty. There is room service at the hotel, but you would probably be better off eating elsewhere. The hotel location is great! You are a 1.5 block from Bourbon and 2 blocks the other way is Canal. It is about a 10 minute walk to Harrah's Casino and The River walk. There is a high end mall just across from Harrah's, but keep in mind the Riverwalk is also a mall and a little less pricey. Be sure to take the trolleys on Canal Street, they are only $1.25 per person and they take you up to the Garden District, Cemeteries and other tourist spots. They have uniformed information assistants stationed at some of the more popular stops. Just let your driver know your final destination and he will let you know when you get close. If your street car approaches and it is full, don't worry there is usually 1 a few minutes behind. Last but not least, New Orleans is a world class city with lots of history and southern charm. It is also just like any other major city with areas that are not safe. So do yourself a favor, do a little history and research before you go and find out what you need to know.

I also booked our room for three nights through a very well-known discount online website. The room is wheelchair accessible so the room and the bathroom were huge. I, too, wondered if I was given this room because of the amount I paid for a room. We had to be moved from that room at 4 am in the morning when a very hard rain caused the ceiling to leak in three places. When I called the first time about the first leak, I was told to put a wastepaper can under the leak because maintenance would not be on-site until 8 am. After the second and third leak appeared, I had to go down to the lobby to explain that we only had two trashbins in the room but now had three leaks. That's when we were given a different room just across the hall and free drink coupons for having to switch rooms at that time in the morning. The new (second) room was much smaller, but that was okay with us. We only want two things from a hotel room: clean sheets and a clean, working bathroom. The second room's bathtub drain wasn't draining at all. So on our way out, I stopped and told the person at the front desk. When we got back, the drain had been fixed! The hotel is on the outer edge of the French Quarter. An easy walk to everything in the Quarter but far enough away from all of the noise. As Lee200909 mentioned, the noise in the hotel can be bad. Our first night there was a couple who were having some sort of disagreement. The young woman was pounding so hard on her room's door that I thought she would break the door. Somehow I had slept through the big argument the two had the previous hour (my husband was shocked I hadn't woken up because it was so loud). When I called down to the front desk, I was asked for the woman\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s room number. I thought this was a strange request since it was around 2am in the morning, and we were in our PJs. Plus I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really want to be looking out my door at a drunk and angry person. The front desk person wanted the room number so he could call up and tell them to be quiet. She finally left and the rest of our stay was very quiet. There is very minimal staff at this hotel, and even fewer at night. At least I think there is minimal staff at night, because why wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the front desk person send security up when someone is complaining about someone banging on another guest\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s door? The staff that I did encounter were friendly, very helpful, and very conciousous. On our last day, we left the hotel at 8 am. We checked out and were able to leave our bag in their locked baggage room until we returned at 3 pm. They even called a cab for us. All in all, I think I would stay here again for same price I paid.

The toilet was fixed in about 10 minutes and housekeeping was called. A young man showed up at my door about twenty minutes later with a mop and a trash bag.

You CAN walk everywhere! Plaze De Armas and French market are also within 15 min walk. Back to hotel. My favorite feature is the pool. It is heated and clean!!!! I went lap swimming every night at 9.30pm when families retired to their rooms. I was the only one there. As rooms don't face pool, I didn't hear any noise in my room. The staff is also worth mentioning. Especially bellman and day-time clerks at the front desk were very friendly and helpful. They provided maps, recommended restaurants, gave directions, etc. Definitely stay at this hotel. It is a good value. Prices are fairly low for its location.

Just kids who really don't know anything, but they have lots of maps and brochures! Elevator: One person's creak and jolt is another person's example of charisma in their New Orleans experience. Rooms: I guess every hotel has its clunkers, but our two were perfect for us. Very clean and serviceable. Housekeeping was very efficient and accomodating when we asked them to come back at another time. The bathroom was just fine, nothing extravagant but everything worked. You won't be bowled over by the decor as it is dated, but this is an old hotel in New Orleans, what do you expect? Street Noise: Other than the odd car and motorcycle it was very quiet. there's really nothing around the hotel like bars or restaurants so other than the odd pack of overimbibing Bourbon Stree revelers who took a wrong turn there's nothing to get upset about. Amenities: the Lounge is fine for a drink, but very smokey so we took our drinks out to the courtyard. WE never did do breakfast there but it smelled good. Maybe we'll do it tomorrow.

Upon pulling up you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help but notice the pillars that adorn the fa\u00c3\u00a7ade. Terra cotta tiles align the walkway to the lobby.

It is so important to make a positive first impression and make somene feel welcomed. The first floor consists of the lobby, a restaurant that does serve breakfast and a bar which opens in the afternoon. There is also a courtyard right outside the restaurant that offers additional seating under a striped canopy awning. Located in the courtyard is also the moderately sized pool with lounge chairs on either side. Back inside you will find the concierge desk which is next to the check in. The representative was very helpful recommending excursions and tours. Even going as far as to call the room to let us know when the transportation arrived. Not customary but since I had fallen ill; she felt bad and wanted to help me rest as much as possible. The rooms I have to really say went above and beyond my expectations. The size of the room was especially large with two double beds, a table and two chairs.

Almost all of the rooms offer a French balcony unless they open up to the courtyard. The bathroom was just that, a bathroom, except it had more counter space than I would of thought.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, but it is something to keep in mind . I traveled with a group of 5 (each around 30 years old) from Dec 29, 2007 through Jan 2, 2008. It was my 2nd straight trip to New Orleans to celebrate the new year. Upon arrival, we all noted the unique exterior of the hotel. As has been noted elsewhere, the original architecture is mainly intact, and the building keeps it's 1800s charm from the street. The lobby is standard, but nice, and check in went smoothly. We noted that the elevators, while small, also seem to be from the 1800s. My room was on the 3rd floor, with a courtyard/pool view. It was of decent size, with it's king bed, and room for an overstuffed chair. However, the room was no different than a standard chain hotel. If you're looking for something more boutique, the hotel isn't for you. It turns out we got the 'middle of the road' room at the hotel. Our one friend was accidentally upgraded to a suite, which featured an exposed brick wall and flat screen tv. Our other friends were crammed into a room small enough to be considered European - room for the bed and not much more. The hotel does feature a nice courtyard, with a heated pool. Inside, the attached lobby bar seemed to stay empty. The hotel does serve breakfast, but not lunch or dinner. There is a New Orleans activity counter, where you can get information and book tours and trips on your stay. The Chateau Lemoyne is located in a decent area within the French Quarter. Between the 2nd and 3rd block, it is only a block removed from Bourbon street- yet quiet enough that street noise will not effect you. It's an easy walk anywhere within the quarter, although getting to Frenchman street is a bit of a hike. Still, as NYC-ers, we are used to long walks. The weather held out, and we were able to enjoy the quarter each day of our trip. Overall, the hotel, its simple amenities, and it's location are all fine and good. I had no major qualms about them. I guess my main issue with the hotel is it's client\u00c3\u00a8le that it attracts. It's no surprise that New Orleans is a party town, and NYE and the Sugar Bowl are party events. And as mentioned, all 5 of us staying at the hotel are NYC-ers between 29-31, so we were there for the party as well. HOWEVER - i'm guessing that mainly due to the hotel's moderately cheap prices, the hotel attracts a certain element - mainly, rowdy, loud drunks. On several occasions we dealt with drunks at all hours of the day, who seemed unable to control themselves. We had someone accidentally try to key into our room at 4:30am one morning, as the person was presumingly drunk and confused about his room number. Screaming down the halls was quite common. I stayed at a different, more 'upscale' hotel last NYE, and did not run into these problems. While I do not blame the hotel for the behavior of it's guests, you should keep this in mind when you book your trip.

This was the weekend of the Auburn-LSU game, so New Orleans / the French Quarter was very busy. I booked my room directly through the hotel web site. I requested a balcony room with 2 double beds, which was honored by the hotel. This property is located in the French Quarter, at Dauphine and Conti streets. It is a block over from Bourbon Street and a block from Iberville. I thought it was a good location, although closer to the Canal end of the Quarter than I generally like (I prefer to be right in the middle somewhere). Still, it was very nice, easy to locate, and the staff were very welcoming and friendly. We got early check-in, around 1:30 p.m. instead of 4, with absolutely no problems. The lobby was clean and neat, although the furniture looked a little tired. Our room was also clean and neat, and the furnishings there looked recently updated. Nice decor in rich shades of gold, burgundy and green, with a French Quarter / Fleur de Lis type feel and design. The bathroom was nice, with marble countertop and a curved shower curtain rod for extra room. Water pressure was good and water was hot. As promised, our room had a balcony overlooking Dauphine; however, it was a shared balcony, with three rooms opening onto it. A few mornings this was kind of annoying, as people in the rooms next door would drag the heavy wrought iron chairs around, making a lot of racket. Some people also might worry about neighbors looking in through the French doors or trying to access the room, although we didn't have any problems like that or really worry about it. But, we didn't really even spend much time on the balcony. The view was of some buildings, and not all that interesting. I don't know that I'd pay the extra money for it next time. I had just always wanted to try the balcony-room thing in New Orleans! It was a nice option to have, but not crucial to a good stay. Parking is expensive, $28/day. Lucky for us, we had friends who were staying in a nearby condo and they had street parking available just outside their building, so we left the car there (we rode together). It was fine, no problems, and a good saving! I would probably look for parking either at a nearby private parking deck, which usually runs around $10-15/night, or look for street parking. Just be sure not to park illegally - they WILL boot your car or tow it. We had a resident at the friends' condo advise us about where we could park - she said her car was towed once for being too close to the stop sign. All in all, this was a very enjoyable stay for a very reasonable price. I liked that the property had a historic look and feel, yet was updated and modern too. Being closer to Iberville turned out to be convenient, as we found a bar on the corner of Iberville and Chartres to watch the game. If you need a good sports bar, try this place. It is called Jimani. I got the sense that this is more of a locals place. They had 4 wide-screen plasma TVs over the bar, and about 3 more TVs on walls across from the bar - and this is not a huge place! The bartender working the night of the game was super - very friendly and played along with all the sports fans, even though she was outnumbered by us out-of-towners rooting against her home team. :-)", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood value, great location\u201d", "Author": "xmasatthebeach", "ReviewID": "UR10216123", "Content": "Great stay, rooms are nice & clean, nice Mardi Gra style decor, loved the terrace overlooking the street.

This was my fifth trip to Southern Decadence in New Orleans, but my third staying at this hotel. This year affirmed why I keep coming back. It was a great price and one of the only hotels that offers the flexibility with their cancellation policy that the Chateau LeMoyne does on their flexible rates and the service and facilities were excellent as always. We arrived Thursday afternoon at least two hours before check-in time and got a room right away. Todd was the person who checked us in and I believe he was one of the managers as well. Check-in was very fast and efficient and we were on our way to the room in no time. I advised him that two more of my friends would be arriving to check-in for the second room later on and asked if their room could be close to ours, he saved the room next to ours for them. We were on the fourth floor, and I believe I have actually stayed in the same room (422) before. It overlooks a side street so it's not noisy and directly across the hall from the room there's a view of the courtyard and the pool. It's not a view directly from the room but still nice to be able to look out at the pool area right after leaving the room. The building is very old but not worn downt, the age just adds to the charm. The elevator is also very old and riding it can sometimes be an adventure, but it fortunately hasn't gotten stuck or anything while I've been there. It's still designed inside the way it was originally, the elevator could use some updating. The room was nice, as I've always experienced here and it was a good size. Both the room and the bathroom were very clean, a definite requirement for me. The only thing in the room that I feel should be replaced is the wallpaper border at the top of the walls, there are scuff marks in some places and it is peeling off a little at a couple of the corners but it really isn't a big deal at all. You get two bars of soap in the bathroom, a tiny one and then a bath and body bar which is almost the size of a regular bar of soap, for the shower or bathtub if you're so inclined. You also get a tiny bottle of mouthwash which is a nice touch and of course a small bottle (not a packet) of shampoo. The beds were very comfortable. The pillows weren't that great but did the job and they've now added something new, a pillow menu. You can order firmer or softer pillows or a neck pillow from guest services, at no charge of course. We didn't get around to doing it so I really can't complain about the pillows much, or comment on how the other pillows were. The service, again this year, was excellent. The employees from the porter to the front desk staff to housekeeping are all very friendly and helpful, with just one exception at the front desk. I didn't have very much contact with her, but there is one front desk clerk that is not rude but not all that friendly either, basically you just get the feeling she'd rather be doing something else. I've never eaten in the restaurant here but they do only serve breakfast now. Last year they mentioned this was because due to Katrina their staffing levels are not sufficient to staff it for lunch and dinner. This doesn't matter at all to me because I am usually not up early enough at hotels for breakfast and even if they offered lunch and dinner, I would much rather eat the food at the local restaurants. The food is one of the many reasons I love New Orleans so much and try to come at the very least once a year if not more. There is definitely no place like it in America. The French Quarter is like a small piece of Europe in America. We did use the pool area for the first time this year, and it was enjoyable with the exception of too few chairs to lay out in the sun. There were a handful of people down there on Friday but those chairs were all in use. There were chairs available that you could sit in so we made do, but more of the others would be nice. The area does get a good deal of sun despite being surrounded by the buildings of the hotel. Check-out was a breeze and the same clerk checked us out that checked us out last year, she was quick and very friendly. I definitely recommend staying at this hotel and really don't understand the negative reviews. I have never parked here, that's $28 a day so it's best to fly and you really don't need a car if you are planning to stay mostly in the Quarter, Garden District, or the Central Business District. Taxi or streetcar is more than sufficient. If you are concerned about travel to New Orleans, don't be. There are police all over the French Quarter and are visible in other areas as well that most tourists or business travelers would go. If you loved New Orleans before Katrina, every thing you know and love is still there and if you haven't been back yet it's definitely time to come back!

The hotel is superbly located just a block off Bourbon Street in the heart of the French Quarter, so it is within easy walking distance of the Vieux Carre's sometimes bawdy night scene -- though we didn't notice it being a noisy place at night. We would compare it to a European hotel and on that basis, it would be a very decent property in terms of room size and amenities. Many have access to common balconies, from which rooms are accessed. (We prefer interior hallway access and we're not much for having people walk past our windows so we chose one of the many rooms without the balcony access.

The hotel has no restaurant or room service which is somewhat of a negative. The bar adjacent to the lobby is attractive but not very busy. The hallways have low ceilings and are not particularly attractive. The two elevators are small but functional. The hotel was an exceptional value for the rate paid.

I'd booked AND prepaid for a visit for Mardi Gras 2007. As of this morning, however, I will no longer be staying at the Le Moyne. For most of my adult life, I have visited New Orleans 6 to 8 times a year, even after relocating from north FL to Chicago. Needless to say, cherished friendships and bonds have been formed in those years. I left the city just 11 days before Katrina, and have returned 5 times in the year since. New Orleans NEEDS folks to come back...spend some time in the Quarter, enjoy a meal in the Warehouse District. She is fighting: scratching, kicking, and screaming to come back. Having said this, it seems almost bizarre how the staff at the Le Moyne chose to deal with my husband and myself on a recent Sunday afternoon. We've never stayed with them, and are somewhat 'relearning' as we had for years stayed with friends at their B&B in the Marigny. We decided to stroll over to the Le Moyne and asked, explaining that we already held a future reservation, if we might view a sample room--any room. Nope. No. Sorry, Charlie. No way, Jose. That was pretty much the extent of the courtesy and 'service' we were extended by the young lady at the front desk. We then, somewhat stunned, asked if we might step into the courtyard (appx 6 feet away, and in full view of the front desk via glassed french doors) and have a look-see. Before she would 'allow' us said entry, she beckoned the 'security' guard, who had been sitting and chatting with a friend near the pamphlet rack. She looked us over and approved our passage. Oh, my... I might add that during this time, folks were coming and going, regularly and freely. Had we done the same and not had the courtesy to ask, I sincerely doubt that either of these young ladies could have been bothered to even notice our presence. My husband and I are in our mid 40's, he a business executive and I a homemaker. I highly doubt we presented a threat to them, other than to be bothered to actually work. Given the needs that NO has right now for tourists to return, what a scary, scary message to convey!! I hope the Le Moyne will address the apathy and down right rudeness with which their front (aka 'first impression') staff are operating. As for us, we have rebooked at a different lodging establishment for our Feb. 07 visit. Please note, this was the first I've encountered such lack of grace (or common sense, really) during my return visits. Frankly, I don't give a rat's behind that I was 'dissed'. But it is how such treatment might be viewed by ones not as well acquainted--or comfortable--with the city. Finally, let me say once more: The City still has much to offer, and wants to see you back!", "Date": "September 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPrice reflects the quality\u201d", "Author": "RobR", "ReviewID": "UR5627296", "Content": "Got a great deal to stay here through Yahoo which included free parking (a rarity in the French Quarter).

That being said, it is not a 4 or 5 star property, but you're not paying 4 or 5 star rates, so it's probably a fair value. The hotel is old, which it shows in some ways (wallpaper in the room is starting to peel, old fixtures, old elevators), but also adds some to its charms (high ceilings!). Very standard room of adequate size. Bed(s), desk, table, ottoman and bathroom. Iron and ironing board in the closet; have to ask to get a safe. Small pool for swimming and a lounge and restaurant in the hotel (which I didn't try). Have to get up at 7am to get a complimentary paper else they are gone. Can be noisy at times (mostly hotel noise such as the rumbling and vibrations of the air conditioner). Overall, staff was very pleasant and helpful. All in all, not too bad of a place to stay.

We did have a few problems: Our first room had one king instead of being a double, but the front desk was quick to switch us around. Then the a/c in our room leaked and flooded the entry way. It was a little upsetting that this took about 2 days to fix, but it is an old building. The staff at the front desk were helpful but nothing out of the ordinary. The breakfast buffet was nothing I would chose to do, but worked when we had to get up before noon. But the pool was very clean and provided a relaxing environment. The location was what made the hotel above average for me. A quick (drunken) walk from bourbon street, Acme Oyster is about 1 block away, as are many good restaurants. Location combined with the great government/military rate we were able to secure made the hotel.
