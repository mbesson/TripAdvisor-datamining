{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Dump I recently stayed at this place with my father. From the outside the hotel looks great it's old, it's big, it has a beatiful chariot on a fountain in front, but once you get inside it's a whole other story. The rooms really aren't bad, the fact that their refrigerators don't work and they don't have extra soap or toilet paper were mere inconveniences. Considering we paid $1000 a night, a hotel that steals (housekeeping took my key and kept it) your key card when you leave it in the key system to keep the air conditiong running while your eating breakfast is going beyond frugal, especially when they threatan to charge you $20 for the missing card. The main gripe I have about this hotel is it tries to act like its a 5 star hotel, but it comes nowhere close. It charges the rates of a 5 star, but half the staff has no clue what they are doing 90% of the time, a simple ordeal of trying to get ice can take a half hour. The store in the lobby is insulting to anyone who got ripped off staying at this place, they charged 30 yuan, about $4-5 for a bottle of water, when you walk into the store next to the hotel they charge 3 yaun for the same bottle. The hotel lied abuot the location claiming they were close to Tianamen square the hotel is about 20 km form the square. If you speak English for the love of god never go into the hotel restaurant, Dynasty.", "Date": "Aug 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR788307350", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Ihavebeeneverywhere"}, {"Content": "Not a 5 star more like a 3 We spent 1 week during the Olympics at this hotel. The room had dirty carpet, and were very worn and old. The whole hotel is worn and old. The pool is a shared community swimming pool, not a hotel pool. The pool, while large, has lane markers for lap swimming. It was not good for our children who like to jump off the side, and play games in the hotel pools. Do NOT get your laundry done through the hotel. I was charged $80 for 5 shirts, 1 men's shirt and some smaller items. Of course we were overcharged for everything...I hope that was only because it was the Olympics. If you need to be the area, definately try the JW Marriott over the Royale Plaza The staff was friendly and tried hard. The facilites were in no way 5 star..more of 3 star.", "Date": "Aug 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR307981107", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "eaf67"}, {"Content": "Just a little communication problem       outside the hotel", "Date": "Nov 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR299460189", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "LAFRAGIA"}, {"Content": "Won't be going back I stayed at this hotel for one night due to its proximity to my customer's offices. On arrival, I was struck by the grand entrance, attempting to mimic the grand hotels of Paris. The hotel has a broad frontage and a shiny gold statue and fountain in front, along with a circular driveway. The lobby is very spacious and on the ornate side but not offensive. My initially pleasant surprise wore off when I was shown to my room. Though it had all the usual amenities like shower, tub, minibar, toiletries, etc., everything was tired and seemed run down. The beds were uncomfortably firm, and the airconditioning was inadequate. The only saving grace was that the service was cordial and prompt. However, I won't be going back.", "Date": "May 29, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR894729557", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "SnowjoHK"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d648610-r19354909-Howard_Johnson_Plaza_Royale-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "648610", "Price": "$117"}}
