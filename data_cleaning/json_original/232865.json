It is also clean.The people were very friendly and went out of their way to be nice to us. And the location is great. But when it comes to the hotel, it is a great example of a designer with no counter weight in terms of function. It drives me crazy to have to endure a designer's idea of things that look great, but have little practical value. Many of which are examples of things that are just not thought through. 1) a two story lofted room, with one telephone - you can move it upstairs or downstairs, but either way you have to run back and forth. 2) Maybe it is just a European thing, but a tub with a shower head, and no shower curtain? I am not talking about a spacious shower area with no shower curtain like you find in some cool hotels, with showers that are large enough to have a party in. No, this is a small round tub - but it looks so cool!!! But, combine the absence of a shower curtain, with slick painted concrete floor that has no drain and you are asking for a nightmare of a fall. Not to mention a mess. (doubly bad if the phone rings downstairs while you are getting out of the shower) 3) Add to this the fact that you cannot use the bathroom sink without water splashing all over the place, since its chic design is round, shallow, and the faucet sits about 12\" above the bowl. But the shower and sink look so nice! 4) be sure to bring your Kevlar gloves if you get a lofted room - the glass and stainless steel staircase if fraught with sharp edges - they will slice your hand open if you are accustomed to using a handrail for its intended use - holding onto it as you navigate the staircase - but I do have to say that the glass and steel look exquisite!! Just not made to really be used (like the sinks and the tub). 5) The wireless or the hard wired internet - it crawls, if you can get connected in the first place. The login is so cryptic and we never could get the wireless to work in our room. They brought us a Ethernet cable - which works but still too slow to get email as fast as my iphone.... Really had to leave it running for a few hours to download my email. 6) If you get up early and want to work at the desk downstairs, after navigating the staircase. you get to sit at the desk downstairs - but, you cannot find a light that works to see what you are doing at the desk, unless you light up the whole place! You see the designer who did the lighting apparently thinks small lamps are not in vogue, so you have recessed ceiling lighting and the only way to light the desk work area, is to pretty much light up the whole place. Hmm, great unless someone is sleeping upstairs and you want to catch up on writing reviews or working... 7) The TV looks so nice hanging from the wall about 12 feet away from you as you lie in bed - you see, laying in bed is the only way you can see the screen. It is about 7 feet off the ground and does not tilt down -- so you can watch it from the low sitting bed - yes the beds are about 1/2 as high as normal beds, which is soooooooooo cool. The two look great independently, until you decide to use them together -- a tv way up on the wall, that does not tilt down combined with a low bed and very flat pillows. They could leave out the TV and add another telephone and a shower curtain and still have money left over to upgrade their internet speed. I could mention a few other things -- but time is short - we need to get designers to use their products to avoid these easily avoidable things........ the hotel is nice, just not luxury as I know it and not very user friendly is many regards. Last thing - message to designers - do not put a bed 1 step away from a spiral staircase, using a handrail that has sharp edges -- you are seriously asking for someone to get hurt!", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wellington", "Title": "\u201cThe good, bad and ugly\u201d", "Author": "alicia18", "ReviewID": "UR127618216", "Content": "Good service, breakfast and location.

Room was clean and modern with great shower and a huge bed, nothing much else was needed as we were either out and about or to be found on the rooftop terrace which had great views of the city from a number of viewpoints. Our only disappointment was the plastic awnings covering most of the terrace as it was considered winter still (not for us brits who think temperature of 72 degrees is a fully blown summer). Also the lovely church ajacent was covered in scaffolding and plastic as well. Special thanks go to Joseph the doorman, who gave his complete attention to us, regarcdless of what was going on around us, and recommended fantastic restaurants and walks through the old, more intersting streets to and from various places. We particularly loved La Tritone which served an exceptional meal. Joseph made our stay that bit more enjoyable and 'real' as well as enabling us to maximise the 3 days we had. All in all, we were able to walk to pretty much all the main sights and took advantage of the hop on hop off bus which is a great way of getting to see everything efficiently.

The hotel is in a great location for walking to all of the major sights & the metro is only a couple of minutes away for those further afield places. We arrived at 11 am & we were met by a very nice receptionist. Her english wasn't great but was passable. She told us our room wasn't ready yet & to go & have some lunch & come back in an hour. We could leave our cases. She then told us about all of the trips we could do from the hotel. These were expensive & very much a whistle stop tour of the sights. You can easily do everything on your own from this location. She also told us we would need to make a reservation for dinner, which we did for 9pm. As instructed we returned an hour or so later & were given our room keys. No directions to our room we given. We made our way to our room & met a man with our cases in the hallway. He had great difficulty getting the door open with our key card. He took our bags inside & left. The twin room had two single beds push together in the middle of the room & there was room for two chairs infront of the TV. The room faced onto the main road which was quite noisey especially in the late hours of the evening & the early mornings. The mini bar wasn't working & everything in it was warm. All of the electric then went off & we had to discover that the room key also activates the electricity in the room. But again it was very difficult to get the key card in the right position to keep the electric on. It became an art form all of its own. The bathroom looked bright & clean. However when we used the shower the bathroom floor flooded. This happened every time we used the shower. We couldn't work out where the water was coming from. By 8.30pm we were starving so we went up to the rooftop restaurant & asked if we could eat then rather than att 9pm. After the waiter made a lot of fuss, in italian, he showed us to a table. Where we discovered we were the only people in the restuarant, so what was the issue with us eating 30 mins early? We had one course each with vegs that cost extra, 2 cokes & one spirt. The food was bland & un exciting at best & the bill cam e to 113 euros. Be warned it was not good value for money & not good food. Breakfast was buffet with tinned fruits cold meats cereal, cake & pastries. Some very strange, greasy looking bacon & scrambled eggs that were cold. There was also tinned sausages/hot dogs. This was billed as American breakfast. My husband is American & I have no idea why they thought their breakfast was American in any way. When we returned from our day out we asked about wifi access & was given a sheet with the codes & passwords on it. It also said it would be charged at 10 euros per 24 hours. This was a mistake & it was free for our stay but we had to keep getting new codes. My son then asked where the gym & spa were & the receptionist said they didn't have a gym or spa. We later found it in the basement. 2 running machines for the gym & the spa was a bed with a towel on it. The hot tub on the roof doesn't exist either. Floor 10 is covered in building materials. We decided to watch the TV whilst we got ready to go out. The only english speaking channel was BBC news. There are NO other english channels, its all Italian or German. On the following day when we returned back to our room there was no hot water & it stayed that way for the rest of our stay. The bedding had been changed but there was dirty makeup on the pillowcases. All the reception staff would say was \"no\" when we complained & then acted as though they didn't understand. Also the lights in the bathroom stopped working & some of the lights in the bedroom also. The staff are uncaring & unhelpful when you need assistance. Having read some of the other reveiws I think we didn't do too badly at least our room had windows. There are many other hotels on the same road which are far superior to this hotel & cost a lot less. BE AWARE THIS IS NOT A 5 STAR HOTEL BY ANY STREACH OF ANYBODIES IMAGINATION & THERE IS NO LUXURY WHATSO EVER. IT IS NOT WORTH THE SORT OF MONEY IT CHARGES.

Minimalist design, which seems to mistake minimalist for design. Yet my room was large and I guess I can say that the space was enhanced by the simple lines of decoration. On the bright side: Via Nazionale is a good location for visiting Rome. The hotel has good noise isolation (Rome can be very loud). I stayed on the back side, the courtyard was not charming but quiet. Some rooms are large and roomy. Mine (401) had large bedroom, large bathroom (see pictures) and plenty of storage space. The bed was huge. 2+m I guess. Large and comfortable bathroom, towels warmers, 'massage' shower. Ok amenities. Nice large mirrors throughout the room. Definitely clean (room, bathroom, corridors) On the not so bright side: Only suites have bath (if I understood what I was told, unless that night only available bath were suites ? ). No bathrobes. No tissues. No extra covers and pillows. No coffemate (that seems to be standard in Italy). No clock on bedside (bring yours!) . I expect all these in a luxury hotel. They overdid it with electronics not always with success. The power control (put your hotel key in slot by door) 'died' on me when I was on the other side of the room (bad contact). I had to make it to it in total dark. The sink water is photosensitive, but so little sensitive you can not have water running without keeping a finger on it. TV -no different than in most italian hotel - 70% italian, 30% german, some english (no french). Only BBC was there for me. European sick economicy all evening ... Charming. Room service menu is pathetic (sandwiches and Hamburgers and that sort) The staff is not always very welcoming. I had various experiences. Good and bad. And it felt short of staff. Restaurant food is very decent. Fresh, not overdone, good produce (and wine). A bit expensive (main course, side veggie, glass of wine and coffee : 44 eur). Deserted that night , it has a terrasse with a 'tent' for winter. It is probably very pleasant in the summer. Properly heated in winter. There was a guitare player, alternating with lounge music. There again I think they have not done enough with furniture, decoration and setting (bar and restaurant) to qualify as the lounge of a luxury hotel. Breakfast is a good deal : Nice buffet (english to continental), 10 eur and all the expressos and cappucinos you would want. There again some 'faux-pas' to Luxury : glasses for fruit juice are Ikea!

We had pre-booked from Australia and pre-paid in excess of A$300 for bed and breakfast. Whilst the room was OK, the bathroom was appalling. A cheap, module shower unit with a grubby shower curtain had been fixed into one corner of the bathroom, the floor of which was flush with the floor of the bathroom, with the result that water from the shower just spilled over the bathroom floor. Several tiles were missing from the shower floor, however, worst of all, a thick ring of mould and slime marked the demarcation between the so-called shower stall and the rest of the bathroom. There was one tap in the bathroom basin for cold water - no hot water. Furthermore, in order to activate the tap, one had to press a small black button at the base of the tap to get a short flow of [cold] water - it took us a while to realise the purpose of the black button. A complaint call made to reception about the slime around the shower and the tap in the basin resulted in a porter with limited English ability being sent up - he stared blankly at the tap and then just shook his head when the slime was pointed out to him. He left, muttering in Italian. Some time later, reception called to ask if we needed a cleaner - we said no - it was late and we were fed up with having to endure such appalling facilities, nor did we want the intrusion of cleaners in our room at that time of night.

Our room was large but sparsely equipped.There was on television on upper level ,but not on the lower level where the sofa/table was located (strange). Television was difficult to use and would not always access the hotel services menu. Our room had a small barfridge but no coffee/tea making facility,no corkscrew / wine bucket.The bed was king size but only had 2 pillows (it took 2 days and 3 requests to get more). The sofas were nice leather, but also had no cushions.Bathroom appeared ok but shower head was loose and took some effort to stop it from spraying water onto the light switch. The view from our window was quite pleasant/noise levels were low with windows closed. Breakfast was included with our room and was quite adequate,staff were only there to pour coffee and check our room number (after we were already halfway through our meal). Staff spoke good english,not helpful, but not rude.

One male staff in particular whom we have had the misfortune to deal with twice was unhelpful and had no concept of good customer service. - Key card did not work and we went to the reception to inform them of this (after not being greeted/acknowledged, we just announced our key card problem to the above mentioned male staff). The male staff completely ignored us, not even bothering to look up. A lady staff eventually helped us and gave us keys to the door. Seems to be a common problem as she wasn't surprised. Why not just fix all the key cards? - Room was tiny with barely any space to walk after laying down our luggages. I know a lot of European hotels have small rooms, but this was ridiculous! I've been to many 3 and 4 star hotels around Europe with much larger rooms than the one offered at this supposed \"Luxury\" hotel - Bathroom was also tiny without a bathtub - Room missing many amenities and looks tired (though clean enough) - The view we got was of an internal stairwell I wouldn't have rated this hotel so low if not for the fact that La Griffe Hotel had the audacity to call themselves a 5 star \"Luxury\" hotel and priced it at such.

The bathroom is large and attractive, with a freestanding bath. However, it was very much a case of design over functionality, as the bath only has a hand-held shower and attempting to take a shower means getting water all over the bathroom floor. They do offer wifi, but only using a password which only lasts one hour (and which you can't log off from, so you can't use it for a couple of ten-minute slots to upload and download emails). Personally I think all hotels should offer free wifi in this day and age. On the Saturday night we went to the bar on the top floor for a nightcap. There were two very raucous parties going on.

All we ask for is what you advertised and what we paid for. La Griffe Hotel was a nightmare, start to finish! Advertised as a 5-Star Hotel, we expected 4-Star as we were told the ratings were different in Europe. This hotel is barely 2 star, and due to the horrendous incidents that occurred, we are giving it a very generous 1 star, but only because there is no option for ZERO stars!!! 1. The comforters are feather filled, they have no other choice. The comforter in mine and my husbands room did not even have a duvet cover on it -- There were feathers everywhere (and we are allergic)! I pulled off the sheet that was covering it -- to find HOLES EVERYWHERE! These holes were covered with STICKERS! PAPER STICKERS! And they were all PEELING OFF REVEALING HOLES AND FEATHERS FLYING EVERYWHERE. I stopped counting at 45 holes! This is what goes against your body as you are sleeping! Rough paper stickers! I called the front desk and they barely understood what I was saying. I finally got them to take them away, but they had nothing to replace them with, other than scratchy wool blankets, which we got for both our room and our kids' room. ALSO... they do not use top sheets! Only a bottom sheet! I asked for TWO SHEETS for each bed, and finally got them, only to find the next day, the maids had removed them along with the blankets.!! So on day two, we had to go through the entire process of getting blankets and sheets again, and only ended up getting 2 blankets for our kids rooms, none for ours!! For our entire 5 night stay, we slept without a comforter and in my room also without a blanket! 2. On our 2nd day, while the maids were putting on the 2nd sheet we requested, my husband and I stood in the bathroom in order to be out of their way (the rooms are SO TINY AND CRAMPED two people can't pass each other around the bed which fills the whole room - you can't even use the drawers in the closet because they can't open due to the nightstand being in front of them!). Anyway, something SMELLED... REALLY BAD! My husband opened the toilet lid to find that the MAID HAD POOPED IN OUR TOILET AND DIDN'T FLUSH IT! We were outraged, and called the front desk but of course they did nothing about that either! So at this point we had to ASK for \"do not disturb signs\" and put them on our door, and had to refuse maid service for the remainder of our 5 day stay -- we did NOT want them taking our sheets away again and not replacing them, and we did NOT want them defecating in our toilet and not flushing it!!!!! OTHER ISSUES WHICH MADE THIS NOT A 5 STAR ESTABLISHMENT: 1. We sent out a bunch of items to them for DRY CLEANING. We had to go ask for them the next evening as they never returned them. They said \"we don't have them here, we'll go get them.\" 2 Hours later they brought them up... FOLDED not on hangers... and they were SOAKING WET!!! DRY CLEANING SOAKING WET???? Silk tops, ruined! We had to hang everything to dry and were without the clothes we needed for 2 more days! 2. Curtains falling off the track. 3. NO soap dish, soap scum everywhere. 4. Shower stalls in BOTH our rooms leaked and completely FLOODED the bathroom floors! 5. Mini bars practically empty. 6. TV reception unwatchable, only CNN in English. 7. NO TISSUES! THEY DO NOT STOCK TISSUES IN YOUR ROOM AT ALL! 8. NO SPARE TOILET TISSUE! RAN OUT AND HAD TO ASK FOR IT. 9. Our room was across the hall from the maids station/room -- they were CONSTANTLY noisy and loud laughing and talking early in the morning and late at night. 10. Room Service - the food was ICE COLD.. cold burgers, cold french fries. 11. CLEANLINESS: While basically clean looking on the surface... look under your bed! In both of our rooms it was completely dusty and filled with feathers from the leaking comforters! 12. INTERNET: They charge 10 euro per day per computer. You have to go down to the desk to get a code. The code will run out in a few minutes - you have to go get another one... we went through this so many times it was ridiculous! 13. I left a small jewelry pouch behind and realized it after I got to the airport. Although they agreed to send it to me, they made me give them my credit card number to pay for it. I've had several other hotels who ship it to you for free... it arrived yesterday, and I am missing one of my gold earrings. 14. STAFF: The front desk staff was very unhelpful, and mostly rude. They acted as though they didn't understand a word we said, and the most they did for us was say: \"The manager isn't here, we'll tell him tomorrow.\" One of the doormen on our last day - we told him we needed a station wagon to take 4 people and 4 suitcases to the airport... he called for one and it arrived -- a mini car! We were late getting to the airport! The front desk manager agreed to drop our extra charges, for the internet and mini bar, but they would not compensate us for one room which we felt would have been fair due to the MAIDS POOPING IN OUR ROOM, having no covers and sheets on our bed for 5 days, having to deal with floods each morning from the shower, etc. etc. etc.!!! THE ONLY SAVING GRACE for our vacation in Rome was JOSEPH, the DOORMAN!! What a WONDERFUL knowledgeable and KIND man he is! Joseph made us feel special, he would recommend a good restaurant and call ahead to let them know we were coming. He completely catered to our needs.

The shower head was defective with water shooting straight out from the sides....water temp & pressure went constantly up & down - cold to blazing hot. There was no way to control this, it seemed a function of the entire water system not individual controls. As an older woman; the upstairs only bath was a real problem after a long day of walking.

The two pillows were already flat from use. There was artwork on the walls that looked as though the manager's 5 year old had done it as a craft project. The furniture was cheap laminated stuff with no character. The decor looked as if a 20 year old Italian boy had dreamed it. I only asked for two wake up calls during my stay - neither one was ever completed by the hotel staff. They did call the male in our party! Because of the melamine decor; the rooms were dank....yes that is the right word - dank. The elevators were so dark that one had to use a flashlight to find the floors - this was during the entire stay. The hallways were done in the same melamine type finish with small lights in the floor. At night they turned off the overhead lights and you had to navigate by the small floor lights. The electronic keys did not work properly. Sometimes it took more than five minutes to manipulate the door lock - hope you didn't have to use the bathroom. Staff was aware of this problem. If they were going by & saw you at your door they quickly used their master card & unlocked your door. Why not just fix the cards they give supposd guests? There was no coffee shop, or small restaurant connected with this hotel. There was a large restaurant with standup small bar on the top floor which was constantly rented out for parties for people in the neighborhood. The night we arrived at 11 p.m. a huge group of teenagers were wandering around the hotel from a party there. They had a concierge desk but when asked for a menu for room service from the restaurant I was told they did not have one and I would have to go to the ninth floor & get my own. Another thing....most hotels change money for their guests...during my five day stay we were told day after day that they just didn't have any money. The bellmen & doorman hung by the front door and outside smoking. The best thing was the delivered continental breakfast (with a $5 per room charge for delivery). I actually cannot say anything else good about this place. Never stay there!!!! They are a racket & just put up a front as a good hotel. The owner has been in place for four years from what I could gather from staff......you would think by now they would know what a five star hotel really looks like. Certainly not some young guys idea of a slick place to shack up with his girlfriend. Other guests I met during my stay had the same and worse problems with getting the most miniscule service achieved.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai, China", "Title": "\u201cVery accomodating\u201d", "Author": "fhfuentes", "ReviewID": "UR114744022", "Content": "I stayed in La Griffe for 3 days in June with my mother in a wheelchair.

Great view from our window. Reception desk personnel was very friendly and inviting. The hotel itself looked great from the outside as well as the inside. Personnel in the Hotel was very friendly, helpful and always up for a chat. Their English proficiency was good but sometimes difficult to understand, but they really try their best. The breakfast on the roof of the Hotel was amazing, everytime we ate there we felt amazed! Personnel serving coffee and tea were very friendly and helpful. Didn't bother taking pictures of us if we asked them to. There was a good variation of food, scrambled eggs - bacon - bread - cereal - fruit - sweets - jus d'orange etc. It was very relaxing to eat on the roof with the sun shining and looking at an amazing view of Rome. We want to thank Josef the doorman who was, in our eyes, the heart and soul of the hotel. Everytime we entered or left the hotel, Josef welcomed us with a big smile and really showed interest in us as a person, not a customer.

Room - Small, not 5 star clean, no changing of sheets during 3 nights, noisy - \"people outside the room appear to be in the room\", no iron, no tea/coffee, lousy lcd tv with a noisy picture and bad remote control.

There was a lot of fruit which was nice! 4 Diffrent kinds of cereal and a couple of diffrent kinds of youghurt, totally ok. If you like a \"normal\" (for us) breakfast, there was only 2 kinds of bread of which one was not tasty at all. One type of cheese, but then 3 types of ham/mortadella and turkey.

No hot water at 9:15am on two mornings of our stay. 3. The hotel would not provide us with a bathroom where we could have a shower after checking out and waiting for our late night flight back to Australia. This is totally unacceptable. 4. We slept on two single beds pushed together, of which my husband's was on an angle. 5. There was no complimentary internet in the room (a standard feature in 5 star hotels, but not this hotel). 6. The TV did not work correctly. Changing the volume with the remote changed the channel so we could not watch TV. 7. There was no tea and coffee making provisions in the room.

These lads on the door provided us with some of the best service we got in our 2 months in Europe. 2: Tell us how you liked the room The room was pretty standard but it did have room for the bags without having to climb all over them, the bar fridge was a joke and it didn\u2019t work it couldn\u2019t even keep the water cold even after we took out the entire mini bar stuff. The main door to our room was warped / bent and if you didn\u2019t slam it wouldn\u2019t lock which made the neighbours happy I\u2019m sure, but it was also an issue of having to check it was closed properly all the time, also our window was right next door to the church steeple and the church bells were quite loud. 3: Talk about the location & amenities Breakfast was served in on the rooftop which was a problem the morning it rained as there was no contingency, was pretty funny watching the waiters trying to keep the buffet breakfast dry. Breakfast was very disappointing with only some cereal and yoghurt, a choice of ham and salami with bread roles, a few cakes and fruit that wasn\u2019t very fresh, and that was it, but as we have discovered its pretty standard fare in Europe. The location is central in Via Nazionale near Piazza Venezia, which is about a 15 minute walk from the main railway station. The distance to all the sites are walkable, see below: There is a super market a couple of blocks down Via Nazionale and there is a Laundrette not far down Via Della Quattro Fontane near Barbarini. Trevie Fountain 15 min Coliseum 40 minutes Vatican and St Peters is about 50 min walk Laundrette and decent internet 10 mins walk The Internet access was via the TV in your room, it was expensive and totally useless, basically it didnt work and the laundrette I mentioned above has internet access which is cheap and with modern fast PCs. 4: Say what you liked best & least Not a lot really, for a hotel to be called La Griffe Luxury hotel it left a bit to be desired, the room and it amenities were disappointing and the breakfast were not flash so whilst its not the worst hotel I have ever stayed in its not what I would expect as a luxury hotel in the heart of Rome.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northern Ireland", "Title": "\u201cNot as 5 Star as you'd expect for the price!\u201d", "Author": "DavyMac69", "ReviewID": "UR51361729", "Content": "After always wanting to visit Rome I finally got it booked and decided to opt for the 5 Star treatment, which was over my budget but what the hell!

Different girl from this morning, she couldn't have cared any less!! The water warmed up about an hour later, enough to have a wash in luke warm water. Problem 2, which annoyed me the most was breakfast. I'd paid extra for breakfast to be inclusive, and, after a long first day, a nice breakfast in bed was on the cards. On the card it said \"Continental Breakfast WITH croissant and roll, tea or coffee and juice. We got a croissant and pastry and some crappy crispy bread in a packet with the coffee and juice.

On their own web-site it states you have full internet access in your room so I didn't bring my laptop, of course the internet never worked! All in all the only 5 star thing about this hotel is the front and reception. The rest is rubbish and extremely over-priced. I would never reccommend this place to anyone.

Our room was about 10 x 10 foot and you could just about walk around the bed. Our view was an internal fire escape, which let no light in as it was surrounded by a brick wall. We kept the curtains closed so we didnt depress ourselves! The bathroom was tiny and you could only get to the toilet if you closed the door first because it was only about 4 foot wide. When we checked in we were told that our room wasn't ready and they showed us a suite for an upgrade price of \u00a3400 (over 3 nights!). When we said no because it certainly didnt warrant the cost they wanted, our room suddenly became available. The decor is depressing.... black and red. The corridors are painted battleship grey both on the walls and floor and very dimly lit. The welcome pack had one piece of paper in it telling us it was a no smoking room. There was no room service. We asked for some towels and had to ask twice before they turned up. When checking out we were given a bill for another room that they'd transferred to ours (even though they were for different names and a different room number) and we had to argue that we had only stayed in one room throughout our stay and not been in the other room. We arrived on Saturday afternoon and phoned reception to ask for an iron as most of our clothes were creased from travelling. We were told that they were not allowed to have irons in the rooms (probably 'cause they wouldn't fit in!) but they had an external ironing service. When we asked for this they said we were too late in the evening and they are closed on Sundays so Monday afternoon would be the earliest we would get them back! After about 20 minutes of protesting at the reception desk we finally got someone to iron 4 items for that evening. We had dinner at their rooftop bar and had to use our mobiles for light to see the menu. They only had one toilet up here, which was frosted glass so you could see a shadow through it when you turned the light on and it had no lock on the door. I walked in on some poor woman on the loo, which was embarrassing for both of us. The good thing is it is quite central (about 15 mins walk) to most of the sights in Rome. Rome itself is spectacular so don't let this put you off. One tip.... bring flat shoes as all the roads are cobbled and not good for heals.

It had twin beds and in order to get a double bed the only solution was to zip a double sheet over both mattresses, connecting both beds - the beds were on wheels so they slid apart! Decoration in the room was minimalistic - this may be a personal qualm but in comparison to other 5* facilities it seemed lazy and it just didn't have the finish you would expect. More misleads by the website included the absence of bathrobes and slippers and the wifi was only available at certain times or else you were charged for it and it was only available through the television/keyboard function. We could continue about many more small niggly things but we'd be here all day. The best thing about Hotel la Griffe was it's location. The metro station and the train/bus terminal were within 5 minutes walk from the hotel and major attractions were pretty much all within walking distance. The street seemed to be a good shopping street and there were bars and restaurants all very close to the hotel. The breakfast which was included in our price, was very nice.

There was not even so much as a sign on the outside of the builiding, which caused our driver to have to pass the hotel twice before he spotted a doorman at the entrance to a building on Via Nazionale that appeared to be a hotel. A standard room in this hotel was barely large enough to accommodate two adults. Also, the rooms are not at all suitable for families since the bathroom walls are constructed of frosted glass, which turned out to be very \"see through\" as well. There were no windows in either of our rooms, which made it dangerous when the power went out (three to four times during a two-day stay). The air conditioning didn't ever cool properly and was never fixed after having complained about it at the front desk.

We had a problem with our tv at one point and a maintenance man came immeadiately even though very late at night! The staff helped us with taxis, advice, tours and maps. The breakfast was average european hotel fare, but the food i ordered through room service was very good. The only thing i wouldnt reccommend is their private car service to the airport, the regular taxis cant charge you more than 35 euros under new regulations so dont think their private rate of 50 euros is a good offer! The location is great and we felt very safe. I would definitely recommend the hotel, but would advise not to stay in their most standard rooms based on our experience and the other reivews i've read.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "England", "Title": "\u201cFantastic\u201d", "Author": "Mickh60", "ReviewID": "UR7245764", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel to celebrate our wedding anniversary. On arrival we were dealt with politely and efficiently. Our room was super, we had asked for a standard double, and the room was great. The bed was super king size and there was plenty of room for the large plasma tv etc. Very clean, very modern with high ceilings and french doors opening onto the main road. With the doors closed, even at peak traffic, there was very little excess noise, and none during the evening. The hotel did not get upset when we were late checking out as a result of not putting our watches forward. Anything we asked for was sorted quickly e.g a car to the airport. The location was excellent and everything was within walking distance. The Colosseum is essentially at the bottom of the road.

We could not open the window as the heat was so hot from this thing outside it was unbearable. I paid extra for a delux room and this was NOT that! The maid did not come to change our towls or clean the room so we had to do this ourself. When we checked out they over charged my card. I told them there tand then what they had done and they said they could not refund me as it was a Sunday. This was 38 days ago and i have still had no money back. It is not a small amount of money either. I have called about 7 times and sent about 20 emails, they keep saying they have sent the money to my bank but they have not.

Do not be put off by the bad reviews as myself and my boyfriend thought the hotel was fine and staff on the doors very helpful and always open the door for you and give you advise on where to go and eat. I would reccomend that you ask the man on the door for a map of rome so that you can find your way around. The hotel is about a 15min walk to the Trevi Fountain, 25min walk to the collisum, and about 20mins to the Piazza Novana Area you must go here for an evening meal as it is a busy square and lit up by candles.

The day was further marred by our decision to eat dinner in the hotel's terrace restaurant, where we were tortured by a tone deaf 'musician' with a keyboard permanently stuck in 'demo' mode. To top it off, the restaurant staff attempted to overcharge us by 35 euros for items we hadn't ordered, which I then had to argue about in order to have the money refunded. I wouldn't have expected this kind of behaviour from a 4 star hotel. The rooms were in contrast wonderful, with new plasma screen TV's, air conditioning and brand new bathroom fittings.
