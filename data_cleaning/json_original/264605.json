The location is also quite good for those who prefer quiet good night sleep without noise from a bar downstairs and reasonable walking/tram distance to places. If you want to be a bit closer to Leidseplein but still in a quiet area, for example the museum area might be even just slightly better location for you, for example Bilderberg Hotel.

Otherwise the hotel was small, beautiful and very fresh with good new beds, elevator and a doorman during the nighttime. Our room was a bit warm during the daytime even though it was only about 20 C outside, but you can open the large windows. Other Caf\u00c3\u00a9 Kale just across the street served excellent simple meals. There are plenty of lower-quality tourist-trap steakhouses in the busier areas.

Most small private hotels in Amsterdam all tend to be small and 'quant'. This is edges them out a little bit on price, location & free internet. It's only about a 5 minute walk to Leidseplein plaza, and a lot of that is along a beautiful part of the canals. Additionally, it's right next to a tram line which go straight into the city centre, but truth is that it's only about a 15 to 20 minute walk from this hotel, and much of that takes you past common city attractions. The room itself is average. Certainly a 'no-frills' hotel. It has free wireless internet in the room and that is a real bonus. Breakfast was light, but adequate and the coffee fresh & hot. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. In Summary, if you're the kind that don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room and are not looking for much then this is a good place. Good Location, friendly staff, free internet and a light breakfast makes for a good base to explore Amsterdam.

The breakfast was very basic - not even a toaster!! The waitress said lots of people ask for toast - so why doesnt the hotel invest in one......... The bread was delicious but there was a very poor selection of food- one type of cheese (out of a packet), ham, chicken, tomatoes and cucumber, 2 types of cereal and a few different jams. Oh yes and hard boiled gs - nothing cooked fresh or hot and not even croissants. I saw the manager go from handling room keys to picking up cheese from a packet to put out in the breakfast room without washing his hands or using gloves - uck! The staff were extremly friendly and helpful and are an asset to the hotel. The carpet on the stair was filthy and the handrail sticky with dirt.

My bed was lovely and comfy and I was extremely thankful to the staff for managing to source me an adaptor so that I could use my laptop and phone charger. My only issue with the room was the paper thin walls. I don't know if this was the same in all the rooms...but in room 38 it was definitely the case.

Well you do get a key but you can only use it within the hotel premises. Incredibly stupid! So every time you leave the hotel you have to turn over the key to the front desk.

It was about a 5/ 10 minute walk from Dam. No bothers. Just near the Heineken Brewery. The Hotel... The room was really clean, comfortable and spacious enough. We stayed in a triple room (Room 17). We were very happy with the bathroom everything was spotless and clean towels every day. Breakfast... Continental breakfast, oj, tea/coffee, boiled eggs, bread, jams, crackers. Good to keep you going 'til lunch.. Nightlife... Leidsplein, Cafe de Waard is good for music. The irish bar was alright, even though we sat outside. When the bars close at 1 a.m. ask any barman where Biblos is. It's just around the corner but make sure you go around the right corner. When Biblos closes at 3a.m. ask those barmen where Bourbon St. is. It's all great craic. All of the locals are really friendly and really know their languages.

This hotel is a straight line 10 minute stroll along an attractive canalside to Rembrandt Square - and from there 5 more minutes to city centre. The hotel staff are welcoming and helpful: our room was clean and fresh with a modern (if small) bathroom: the breakfast of egg, cheese, meats and lovely bread selection was excellent. It sits in a quiet street off a main artery. We took the Airport Connexxions bus to and from hotel - from airport it was a slow process as more people wanted the service than they had the capacity to provide; but return was on time and only 20 minutes to airport. If you have luggage this is the way to go - but if you can manage it, you are much better taking the train in from the airport to Central Station and then either the 4 or 25 tram to Freidrichsplein. The tram stops are just 50 metres from the hotel's street. If you want to avoid the noisy and overpriced centre for dinner, there are two local restaurants we would be happy to recommend to anyone. Thney are located about 200 metres along the main street (to the left) and sit close by each other. One is an Italian (live piano playing and owner occasionally sings!!) called La Storia Della Vita. The other a traditional Dutch called Van Aanderen which would be a wonderful choice for a special occasion dinner, a bit pricey but worth every cent for both food and extraordinary service and ambience. Reservations at both are recommended. Also close to the hotel (opposite the 25 tram stop) is a lovely cafe called Cafe Kale - like a tradional \"brown cafe\" which serves the most wonderful Apple Cake with coffee (and a full range of other snacks/meals and drinks). The young staff are as delightful as the fare they serve. My wife left a ring in the toilet and when we returned an hour later, they had it behind the bar for her.

The hotel is very clean and the staff really friendly. The room was small but comfortable, with a toilet and shower - very clean - the room also had a TV.

The hotel is extremely quiet you could hear a pin drop during the night - best nights sleep i've had in years! I would return to this hotel and recommed it to anyone wanting to visit this beautiful city, the hotel is in a great location - about 15 minute walk into the centre - with loads of bars, shops and restauarnts along the way. Visit the Heineken Brewary if you get the chance - its wonderful, costs 11 euro but you het 3 free drinks and a gift at the end (not telling you what it is but is useful!) the tour is great with loads of hands on things and great for the kids too. Amsterdam itself is lovely with loads of shops, its really clean and we didn't feel threatened at all and really easy to get round, take a boat trip for 7 euro it lasts an hour and you get to see loads of the lovely buildings, all in all a great place and well worth a visit - we shall return and stay again at this hotel", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Copenhagen, Denmark", "Title": "\u201cHotel Nicolaas Witsen Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "GeraldCharles", "ReviewID": "UR7292351", "Content": "This hotel had everything we were looking for.
