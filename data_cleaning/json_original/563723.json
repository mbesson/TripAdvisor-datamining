{"Reviews": [{"Content": "So-so Stayed here for two nights as the hotel I'd reserved originally had stuffed up my booking. Not a good start to the stay in Florence but then the place was so beautiful and charming that I didn't mind staying here. The receptionist during the day was a bit cold but the elderly gentleman in the evening had a pleasant demeanour.The hotel is quite close to the main train station and walking distance to the shuttle to the airport (Florence).The room itself wasn't remarkable with the air-conditioning dodgy at best. Opening the window wasn't an option as the mosquitoes seemed to love it. Just before checking out, I did happen to notice a mosquito repellent in one of the drawers.", "Date": "Oct 26, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR765530018", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Morningsider"}, {"Content": "Abysmal reception and service We made a booking for a 3-bed room at Hotel Alinari through a Rome based booking agent. We get to the hotel at around 8pm and guess what; a 3-bed room wasn\u9225\u6a9b available for us. The greatest disappointment was the way the gentleman (Christiano Bianco, he said his name was) at the reception treated us. We were tired after a long day\u9225\u6a9a travel and all he could do as a help was to treat us with utter disdain, even asking to go back to Rome to change the booking with the booking agent! He simply refused to do anything \u9225?not even contact the booking agent to clarify our booking \u9225?or to look any other option, he almost shoved us away scornfully and we had to leave the hotel late in the night. Anyway, the whole Alinari experience was a blessing in disguise because we cancelled this booking and got a 4-star suite accommodation, that too for 20 Euro less. Alinari was the only bad experience we had in Florence, but mind you even one rotten egg can spoil a whole basket of good eggs! We would not recommend Alinari even to our worst enemies\u9225\ufe39\u20ac?!!!", "Date": "Apr 13, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR232530088", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "GeorgeTheTraveller"}, {"Content": "Very close to station       Bedroom", "Date": "Sep 26, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR660003758", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "DickyG"}, {"Content": "average hotel If you are traveling by train, this hotel is very near to the station- a big plus with luggage.

The front desk folks were quite friendly. Our room was very large and the bathroom was enormous. A/C worked wonderfully and the room was very clean. We stayed on the first floor with our window right up against the Plaza and slept quite nicely. The buffet breakfast was typical (cold meats and dry cereal) Overall a very nice hotel at a very nice price. Definately worth the 3 star rating. As far as the odor complaints, we had none. We would definately stay here again. Our only complaint was the king bed was 2 doubles pushed together and had a bit of a crease in the middle, however this seemed standard in all of our other Italian accomodations at other 3 and 4 star hotels.", "Date": "Jul 18, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR901677622", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "bpotts3"}, {"Content": "Noisy Unpleasant decor, and a nasty breakfast Like other reviews we made the mistake of using the hotel booking service in the train station and they reccommened this place. The walls in the room were like cardboard and it was nearly 3am by the time it was quiet enough to get some sleep. The staff were surly and unpleasant. In a country that offers excellent coffee this place managed to serve up a cup of the nastiest coffee I've ever tasted. We had initailly intended staying for 3 nights but checked out to another hotel first thing in the morning. The hotel staff wanted to charge us for all 3 nights even though the booking service in the train station said we could check out after a night if we wanted to. I discovered that the Hotel charged our credit card for the 2 nights we cancelled. I've disputed the charge with my credit card company. Don't stay in this place under any circumstances. I've stayed in hotels and hostels in over 30 countries (we've travelled quite a bit) and this place was the worst value I've ever encountered.", "Date": "Jan 30, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR431067231", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Eddie_in_Ireland"}, {"Content": "ugh...won't come back We arrived in Florence without a hotel and made the mistake of using a hotel locator in the train station. While we were pleased with the rate quoted by hotel alinari, we were pleased with nothing else over the next few days. the staff is creepy. The breakfast is not worth waking up for. And we were put in a room that had a window opening up into some sort of open air shaft. The worst part, without question, was the rancid stench that permeated out of our bathroom the ENTIRE first two days. Finally, we asked a maid what the problem was, and she immediately told the receptionist to get us another room (the maid deserves a good review, but that's it). The only positive was that the hotel was so bad, we had extra incentive to stay out in florence late.", "Date": "Oct 30, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR804627347", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "A Room with a View!
