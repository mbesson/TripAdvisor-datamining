{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The STOLE in the room (AVOID) What should have been an increadible week-end in one of the nicest cities in Spain turn out to be a disastrous expirience. Absolute carelessness from the hostal management in what regards security and surveillance during the night dirived in someone just who just picked up the key form reception, open the room, stole a camara and credit cards and left. Without any opposition, without the guard asking who he was...he even took the key with him.The guard, with obvious signs of alcohol in his body, didn't even care about the fact that the keys had disappeared. He just gave us the spare key and we, naively enough, thought that he must had misplaced it.Next morning, we realized our goods where missing and we complaint in the reception. After setting the appropiate formal complaint in the police station we returned to the Hostel to ask whether he could give us the name of the guard.Making a long story short-- no camera, threats from the hostal direction for setting a formal complaint, refusal from the hostal management to give the guards name and telefone number...Do yourself a favour and spare you a bad expirience...avoid this HOSTAL", "Date": "Jul 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR734677269", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Basic rooms, very good service This place is a small, family-owned hostal with fewer rooms. Location is great, right next to the rambla, address sant pau 15, rooms are basic but clean and tidy (thin walls though, bring earplugs), and the staff (an elderly couple) are the nicest people. Maybe it helped being able to say a few phrases in Spanish, I don't know. Anyway, don't expect fancy rooms and stuff, but clean and OK. Good value for money :-) (besides, when in this wonderful city, who'd want to stay in their rooms all day anyway?)", "Date": "May 5, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR146148075", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "itolovesbarca"}, {"Content": "Para echar a correr   showReview(10024219, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 1, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR966390986", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "laVicenta"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d609868-r5462547-Hostal_River-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "609868", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
