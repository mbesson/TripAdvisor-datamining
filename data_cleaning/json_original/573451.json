{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Loved Villa Agung Stayed at Villa Agung Beach Inn. Now that was a nice little place to be, right on the beach. 150,000Rp per night/standard/fan with hot  cold water, including brekky. Their Watermelon with Tamarillo Syrup(Terong Belanda) and grated Coconut was to Live For! Not really Watermelon eaters, but this was beautiful! Found some(Terong Belanda) at Hardy's Supermarket in Sanur, brought two bottles home, but not packed well enough and one broke in my bag! Sticky stuff everywhere, but all washed out ok and didn't stain clothes thank goodness! I think that Hardy's in Sanur are the only ones that stock it! Well according to Gus and Sandy, mine hosts at Villa Agung anyway. Gus and Sandy are great hosts - he is from Washington, DC in the states, and Sandy is from the Jersey Islands near Britain somewhere. Standard rooms were great in my book! Everything very clean. Only used it for sleeping, and relaxing if I wanted some afternoon peace and relaxation. Room upstairs, so had a nice breeze at night. Left both doors open for more breeze. Mossie net to stop the little buggas! I think they were rather flabbergasted that the Country Bumpkin Aussie slept with doors and windows wide open, haha! Anyway,I found the Villa Agung a great little place to stay. The kitchen was immaculate and clean. Cooking classes available. The staff very well trained and couldn't help you enough. Laundry very cheap. Gus, the owner very helpful, and showed you around. He showed me a couple of very good Material shops(Chinese owners) in Singaraja. Very cheap and beautiful materials(depending on what you wanted), approx 25,000rp per metre. Their small Bintangs 12,000, didn't have any big ones so don't know price. Kitchen open all day, so you could eat or drink at anytime up till 8pm. Night Security on Sat night would feed you Bintangs into the early hours if required. Not really a Party place, but all your needs were looked after. No fridge in room, but who cares?Only probs here were with the Beach Seller ladies and fellas. Weren't allowed on the property, but if you went for a massage on the beach(only did it twice, she was good that's for sure) with Made the Massage Lady, all the sellers would hone in on you at the end of the massage eh? And if owners were away down south, they seemed to be allowed in??They were selling Pearls, Belts made out of Coconut wood?, Sarongs, Shirts, Women's Tops, Pants, wooden Dolphins, etc, etc. Lots of stuff anyway. Too expensive in my book. Found a nice little shop round the corner in the next street, where I could buy Sarongs for 20,000 each, but was told not to tell the Beach Ladies or they'd get into trouble. Sounds a bit Mafiarish to me? Anyway I didn't say a word! So, an allround good place to stay, I think! Good place to get to know the locals at the Warungs etc. 10/10 I would give Villa Agung.

We wished we could have stayed another 4 days as it was a wonderful relaxing location, fantastic sunsets, terrific, reasonably priced food and drinks and friendly, helpful service. The owners are fantastically helpful and great company. We stayed in the family suite, two adjoining rooms, with air con, fridge and very clean. The food is really top class and we ate every meal there, a first for us as we generally spread the love around when we travel and like trying new places. we were interested to note that guests from a nearby 5 star hotel regularly walked down the beach to use the restaurant which is open to the public. Although the location is a bit out of the way that didn't bother us. Sandy (owner) took us with her to Singaraja and into Lovina or arranged for her driver to do so at no cost whenever needed. The bemos are also frequent during the day. Sandy was also incredibly helpful when we needed medical attention for an injury our daughter had sustained earlier in our trip. If you wanted to go and party in Lovina every night the location would probably be a bit of a drawback but for us it was perfect. My husband and son had a fun night down the beach in the rasta bar and there are other places around. The views over the ocean from the restaurant and the lounge above it are stunning, the pool is small but clean and the grounds are also lovely. The girls who do the waiting and housekeeping are all locals and very friendly and efficient. Nyoman the groundskeeper/driver, another local, is a real character. All in all, a lovely small, homely boutique hotel which we will definitely visit again and would highly recommend to anyone other than those looking for 5 star luxury or party animals.", "Date": "Jan 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR693934432", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Koko-oz"}, {"Content": "Home from home Vulla Agung is a boutique property right on the beach at Anturan, Lovina. There are 6 bedrooms and 2 cottages, restaurant with an excellent menu and a small pool in a pretty courtyard garden. it's a very peaceful location away from the main village. We stayed there for 6 nights in Sept 2006. Gus and Sandy, the owners, live next door and could not have done more to make us feel welcome. they really put themselves out for their guests. The staff are also extremely pleasant and helpful. it is not expensive and has all the facilities, fridge, air-con etc. The only difficulty is that there is no transport to the nearest village in the evening but we still recommend it very highly.", "Date": "Sep 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR957696750", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "dianagray"}, {"Content": "villa agung ou la tranquilite enfin retrouv\u8305e       plage", "Date": "Nov 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR743778264", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "rabuchette"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g469403-d573451-r20769293-Villa_Agung_Beach_Inn-Lovina_Bali.html", "HotelID": "573451", "Price": "$25"}}
