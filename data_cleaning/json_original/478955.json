On both occasions the goal was a low cost trip with friends and on both occasions the Tidelands delivered. We were interested in reasonably priced accommodations with a pool and a patio off of the room located near the boardwalk. I was dismayed by the poor reviews, but decided to stay there again based on our previous experience. First of all, bed bugs are a serious accusation and I\u2019d hope a reviewer wouldn\u2019t use this term flippantly. I would argue any serious reports of bedbugs would be to the Department of Health and the area would be quarantined, as I\u2019ve seen happen locally. I saw no evidence of such and frankly suspect the references are due to a few vindictive patrons. Our mattress (while certainly not the most comfortable) was in great shape and free of stains, etc. In my opinion, the hotel is priced appropriately for its location, amenities, and level of service. The hotel certainly has its pros and cons and I\u2019ll address a few of them below along with a few takeaways. The hotel has the ideal location with beach views available and right on the boardwalk between Shenanigans and Hooters. The rooms are clean, spacious, and all feature a nice-sized balcony. The sliding door was in great shape with a nice sheer curtain under a black-out curtain (which came in handy as we enjoyed sleeping in). The air conditioning was controlled locally by a thermostat and fantastic. While it was hot and humid outside it was always a cool 70 degrees in our suite. Parking is provided below the hotel and in an overflow lot a few blocks back. They advertise one spot per room, but did offer us a second \u201coverflow only\u201d spot upon request because we booked a suite. The free ice machine is large/industrial and conveniently located on the 3rd floor. The pool bar had decent appetizers and reasonably priced (for the location) drinks. The rooms feature a tiled floor. While this was clean upon our arrival, we carried our share of sand into the room. Maid service seems to be limited to taking out the trash, swapping towels, and making the bed. They don\u2019t seem to clean the floor, etc. except between guests. The maid did have a bad habit of spraying some type of cologne when finished, I would have preferred she pass, but it did dissipate. While the bathroom was clean, the water pressure is lacking. That being said, we never had issues with temperature and the pressure was enough to bathe. Both pools tend to fill with children whose parents don\u2019t seem to supervise them, but this can\u2019t be blamed on the hotel. If I were in charge I\u2019d send the children to the rooftop pool and leave the pool near the bar as \u201cadults only,\u201d but I don\u2019t see this happening. The rooftop pool is a bit frustrating because there is no public bathroom nearby and the buildings aren\u2019t connected.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ronkonkoma, New York", "Title": "\u201cBelow Average\u201d", "Author": "Rich S", "ReviewID": "UR139310682", "Content": "My wife and I chose this Hotel because it was on the Boardwalk, had a good pool, and looked ok in the photo's. This hotel was not all bad, however, it was not a great hotel by any means. -The Good - Great location to beach and Boardwalk- You can't beat staying on the Boardwalk in my opinion unless your are looking to keep things very quiet. - The hotel had two pools, one on the roof and one on the 2nd floor. The 2nd floor Pool had a nice Bar and Grill, The Blue Fin - Very friendly service. The Balcony was nice and big and gave us room for our Beach Chairs and their own patio chairs. - The Bad - The Room did have a musty smell to it, especially when the A/C was on. The cleaning service not so great. We had to request new towels even though they took our dirty towels. I was also annoyed because the second night I had spilled drinks all over the and bed we had in our room including the sheets. The sheets were soaked yet the cleaning crew just made the bed and left the wet sheets on the bed. I guess my fault as I should have asked for new sheets but I had figured common sense would prevail. The room was old, and the fridge did Ice over but that was because the people before me had it on MAX. The bed was not all that comfortable. The room did not have enough pillows. Also, on our first night at the hotel, the fire alarm went off at 2:30 AM with no explanation as to why. -My overall opinion is that for the money, the hotel was not the best option, however, I do think that a bunch of 20 something kids would be able to deal with this place without any issue. If your looking for a full resort experience, then staying at another hotel may be your best decision.

Our stay at the Tidelands Caribbean Hotel was much less than stellar. \u00a0We arrived at the property on 8/26/2012 and will depart on 8/30/2012. \u00a0We decided on this particular hotel because we're Travel Agents and occasionally we get requests from clients wish to be recommended to a few of the smaller hotels that don't carry a big, well-known name. \u00a0 Upon arrival we stated that we were Travel Agents which was also stated on our reservation. \u00a0On our way to the room we immediately noticed certain things that we felt should have addressed. \u00a0As we exited the elevator on the 4th floor there was a terrible smell that greeted us. \u00a0It smelled possibly of mold, very musty and it carried throughout the entire 4th floor. \u00a0The carpet was well-vacuumed, but it was wet in some places. \u00a0This could have been from guests tracking water up from the pool which was located on the 2nd floor, but interestingly, none of the other floors had that smell. \u00a0When we entered the suite, we noticed that the lampshades were stained, had what appeared to be mold on them and had what appeared to be strands of human hair on one of them (there were a total of 5 lamps in the suite) we have included pictures. Also, there were no face-plates covering the electrical outlets in the room with the balcony. \u00a0The floors in the suite weren't sticky or spotty, but they definitely were grimy! \u00a0Walking barefoot on them before our trip to the beach netted an unwanted amount of sand and grit. \u00a0Room service was non-existent and expressing our concerns to the front desk was met with silence and long faces. \u00a0At one point, one of the ladies at the font desk told an older gentleman who was in training that he can \"expect to get a lot of complaints about room cleaning\". Of course we expressed our concerns to the front desk and asked to speak to the manager. \u00a0We were told he wasn't available. \u00a0We left our business cards and asked that he call us in the morning (the morning of day 2). \u00a0We received no such call. \u00a0This room cleaning issue was a constant so we questioned the front desk for the manager again. \u00a0We were immediately told that he wasn't there at the time. \u00a0We then questioned the front desk attendants as to the room cleaning policy for the hotel. \u00a0We figured maybe the policy was such that one would have to REQUEST their room to be cleaned, otherwise it wouldn't be. \u00a0It was at this point the she walked away from us entered the back room for about 15 seconds came right back out with the manager. The manager, Paul Kahn, was calm and attentive. \u00a0Interestingly, he denied ever getting our request for him to call us and said he never received our business cards. \u00a0He did make a call to housekeeping to inquire about what happened, had someone go clean our room immediately and asked for another business card. However, we met with the same thing again the next day. The bright spot by far was The BlueFin Restaurant/Bar!! \u00a0They were amazing. \u00a0Very attentive with a smile, drinks and food were great , they were able to recommend certain items on the menu and they even came out to service the guest while out at the pool! \u00a0Kudos to them!! \u00a0 Very dissatisfied and unhappy.

I want to love the place, and it has its strong points, but it needs some serious care. Our last stay was over Memorial Day. I've looked at a few recent reviews/photos and I'm glad we booked elsewhere for Labor Day weekend. The change was really by chance, no oceanfront rooms were available, so we booked at the Paradise Plaza Hotel. I'll be interested to compare the two since Tidelands has been our mainstay for so long. It seems that things here have taken a sharp turn of the worse, when before the decline was slow, but noticeable. We always stayed in oceanfront rooms and they've been clean enough. There have been times when the paint left something to be desired, and some water stains on the ceiling, a few other nits, but nothing deal breaking. When we first starting coming, cleanliness was a major draw. That must have been soon after their last update as the place has slowly deteriorated since then. The sad part is that it seems that management is in no real hurry to give the place any real attention. But again, we always rented here for the location and the lovely beachfront view, and we've never experienced anything gross or buggy. While I look forward to trying out Paradise Plaza, the view here, with the proximity to the kite shop's beach display, just can't be beat. Plus you have a Dunkin Donuts directly below the hotel for a morning coffee. The place really has potential, but it's falling well short of it. Other pluses, check-in is always easy and friendly. If you arrive early and your room is ready they'll check you in. If not, they'll give you a call on your cell when it is. The pool bar is a nice extra. While we rarely use it, over our last visit friends of ours with children stayed at the hotel so we spent some time sipping beverages while the kids enjoyed the pool. There is another pool (sans-bar) on the roof if you feel inclined. A few additional thoughts; we've never had an issue with parking. The elevator is extremely slow so locate the nearest stairwell. And finally, we've always desired a loyalty program here, and despite recommending it on many occasions, they've never instituted one. In regard to the apparent bed bug issue, that's just a shame. A little dust in the corner never bothers me, some rust on the balcony, fine, but bed bugs are just unacceptable; especially if they continue to rent with knowledge of their presence. While it's probably not the hotels fault for getting them, it should be their top priority to eradicate them. Given this new information, the place probably deserves one star, but we didn\u2019t experience this over our last stay. Maybe I'm being nostalgic, but minus the feeling that the place was not being cared for as it should, our room over Memorial Day was what we\u2019ve come to expect.

I had originally booked the queen room at $209 but the king was available so I called to inquire. The person I spoke to told me about the king suite so she told me that instead of me going through the internet she would give me the same rate because she just had to print them in and put them on the computer at the location.

Then housekeeping knocked on the door and brought new towels and took the towels out that were on the shelf, so I am assuming they just folded the towels and put them back on the shelf. The sinks, tubs and toilets were never cleaned and the toilet paper was not replaced. The entire location was filthy. The housekeeping drug clean towels around in black garbage bags to deliver them.

And yes, this dirty state remained that way for our 3 day stay, never heard a vacuum run up the hallway. DISGUSTING. I wondered why, if they knew how many guests would be there they didn't supply the same number of towels? I had to call the front desk & ask for extra towels of all kinds to be brought upstairs. THE GOOD: Parking is a pain, but the hotel has more than one location to park that is within walking distance. Our 2 room suite was generously sized, not too dated, facing the bayside/city view on the 4th floor.

At that time I would have given it a Very Good, even Excellent when compared to other OC hotels which have a reputation for being a little trashy. We loved the 2 room King suites, which at the time were very new, the tile floors, the location on the boardwalk and the space in each room. It was great! WAS being the operative word. This past visit would have made our 6th visit and the change over the years has not been welcome. Let's start with our arrival. It began much like all the others, we arrive mid-morning. We go to the check-in desk, the room isn't ready (of course, we wouldn't expect it to be at 10:30 since check in isn't really until 3pm) but we pay our balance and they provide us a parking pass. Also, as they have done in past visits, they take my cell phone number and promise to call when it is ready. I see her write my number down, next to our future room number 221. Normally, we would have stayed on the beach until we were called but this particular visit an afternoon thunderstorm had us taking cover around 2:30. I thought as long as we had packed it up I may as well check on the room status. Still before official check in time though I wasn't suprised that it wasn't ready but the person at the front desk said it shouldn't be much longer and double checked that they had my phone number. My son and his friend went to the pool while my husband and I hung in the car--no sense in going to far since it would be ready soon right? It was nearly 4pm when I walked back into the lobby to see if they had forgotten to call me, an hour after check in time. \"I'm sorry , you're room isn't ready yet but I just spoke to housekeeping and they were doing your floors. It should only be another 10 minutes\". At this point I decide to head to the pool bar and drown my annoyance. On the way to the bar and walked by our room which happened to be on the same floor. What I gathered from dawdling out in the hallway was that housekeeping was just starting the room. I went to the bar and at 5pm still hadn't received a phone call. Housekeeping was no longer in the hallway so I headed downstairs to the desk where I found a totally different set of receptionists. I doubt I ever would have received a call and yes, the room was ready and delivered to me 2 hours late. Really, the 5pm wouldn't even be a big deal except that I misled twice. Be honest with me, don't lie to get me out of your face. I could have better spent the time hanging on the boardwalk. Oh and while visiting the pool bar I noticed that the soap in the bathroom was empty, twice. So where are their employees washing their hands exactly? We had a 2 room King suite again. This was the 4th time with this room type. The other two times were in the Ocean view 1King room. Each visit I noticed things that needed sprucing. This time there were things in serious disrepair. I started with my usual bedbug check. This is something I do in EVERY hotel, 5 star or 1 star, bedbugs don't discriminate. However I was far more thorough this time after a very recent reviewer was bitten by and had managment confirm they had bedbugs. I actually took the time to contact this reviewer and she stated that the managments response was to give them black oversized trashbags to put their belongings in and told them not to take them in their house. So instead of giving a quick check of the corners of the mattess and box springs I stripped both of the beds completely. I did not find any evidence of bedbugs (but that doesn't mean you shouldn't check or that they weren't there). One of the mattesses was in absolutely terrible repair. The tape that locks the seams of the mattess had completely come undone and you could see into the springs of the mattress. In general I'd say they were old or of very very poor quality as neither my husband slept well. The teenagers were OK but then they could sleep upside down on a rock. The sheets were worn and frayed in places and one sheet was yellowed it was so old. Not that it was easy to see in the second windowless room where there was only one pitiful floor lamp. I had to do that inspection by the light on my camera phone. Other notable issues: the safe seemed to be malfunctioning, the toilet was not properly leveled and rocked every time I sat down (and then ran so the rocking may have been causing leaking as well), there was no tv remote in the main bedroom and the second bedroom had a remote but it wasn't functional. Oh and the floor that they had been cleaning when I was denied check in, wasn't really all that clean. There was still lots of sand particularly in the corners. The bathroom shower stall was dirty looking on the floor and the prior guest had left their scrubby hanging in the shower which housekeeping also missed. Makes me wonder if they did anything more than restock the towels and toiletries which there were enough of. And yes, if you thinking I'm being overly picky, I probably am but since it was their reason to deny our checkin for two hours then I'm feeling rather justified. I will say the paint looked fresher than it had been the last time we were there two years ago. The rest of our stay involved little interaction with the staff. We had them \"clean\" the room after our second night. They did replace dirty towels but I have my doubts as to whether the bedsheets were replaced after I found what looked like the same yellow top sheet on our bed. Check out the same person who happily took my money and then lied about the amount of time the room would be ready in took my keys. Didn't bother to ask about my stay. Of course maybe she didn't care. Who knows? One thing I did notice as we were loading the car up, two women standing in the lobby with their belongings in oversized black plastic trash bags. None of us experienced any bites but our belongings are in my hot car, in a trash bag, hopefully frying any covert hitchhikers. This hotel either needs to take better care of their facilites and their guests or lower their price point.

Good thing we were all decent but really! The pool bar was open to the public and was standing room only in the pool. My kids hated it! The roof top pool - sounds good but on a windy day - cold and had to watch your things from blowing away! Other than the location this has nothing going for it. The front desk people were rude and only time they talked to us - was when they thought we were a family who hadn't checked out on time... When I called them to help with directions to the fishing center, they had to call me back... ever where I turned it was awful!

If you start with appropriate expectations for this property - then you should leave at least satisfied for the money that you spent. There is lots of talk about this hotel's location and that it \"can't be beat\" - well, that's sadly not the case - because there are at least 20 other hotels that line the Boardwalk in Ocean City - each with the same boardwalk location, ocean front views, and easy beach access. Cleanliness: The room was as clean as an ocean front hotel can be expected to be - there were no noticeable cleaning problems in the room - although the cleaning products that they used did leave the tile floors slightly \"sticky.\" Public areas (hallways, elevators, grounds) were a different story - they were noticeably dusty, dirty and in need of a little attention. Conditions: No matter how \"clean\" a room is - some things are just \"worn\" - the furniture was slightly dinged, the metal door jam was rusted at the base in the bathroom, the AC unit was noisier than necessary, all things that happen in a hotel. None of them deal breakers, and none of them things that can be \"fixed\" immediately upon arrival - or worth complaining about at the hotel... it's who they are. Service: Here is where they fail... and could be so easily remedied... their staff (for the most part) just doesn't care. There are no smiles, there are no good-mornings or good evenings as you walk through the lobby. Your check-in is another thing on the \"to-do\" list for the day and check-out is about the same. The staff seems much more engaged in talking with each other, that with talking care of their guests. This attitude is evident from the manager down - who was more interested in ridiculing her employees, and a technical computer question than about guests in the lobby during check-out. So - why did I rate this as \"poor\" - because in shopping around - I could have stayed at the Holiday Inn, or the Courtyard for the same price - or at the Hilton for about $50/more per night. - all of these places with mandatory service standards, and renovation programs.

That is EXACTLY what the hotel representative told us on the phone when we cancelled our reservation. The service and their response to the reviews alone on this website should be an indicator of the quality of this hotel. Thank you Tripadvisor and fellow contributors. I am sad to say that out of all of the great places I have visited and not left an amazing review, the way in which we were treated from this hotel has compelled me to write this and to warn other people of our experience. Here is a little back story of our experience. I will disclose 100% we did not even get to the point of staying at this hotel. We were very excited to find such a great deal to book a hotel on the boardwalk on the beach the week following Labor Day. I grew up in Maryland and now live out West and I was very excited to get back and vacation in Ocean City. My mother went ahead and found this great deal and looked at the hotels website and it looked nice! She went ahead and booked the room. After further research and vacation planning, we found all of the Tripadvisor reviews and I became very hesitant about staying at this hotel. I trust Tripadvisor as well as the opinion of fellow travelers. This was going to be our first time traveling with our 15 month old and staying at a hotel and the mere thought of bed bugs, ants, and mold scared me, a lot. So... after lots of deliberation, we decided to cancel our reservation and find a different hotel. We are all aware of their cancellation fee and my husband decided to call and speak with someone being that it is June and the reservation was not until September. With the more than adequate amount of time between cancellation and the actual reservation, we were hoping there would be forgiveness with this fee. But there wasn't and we are happy to pay them money to NOT stay at their establishment. Here is a recap of my husband's conversation with a very rude representative of the hotel when he called to cancel the reservation: My husband called and told the representative who answered the phone that we were cancelling the reservation due to horrible reviews on Tripadvisor and brought it up to her that we were cancelling early enough that we probably should not not have to pay the cancellation fee (10% of your deposit). The representative told him that it was their policy to charge the fee. My husband then asked her is she had seen the Tripadvisor reviews and then proceeded to tell the very rude representative that it was OUR Family's POLICY not to stay in bug infested rooms. Her response was \" YOU SHOULD HAVE CHECKED TRIPADVISOR BEFORE YOU BOOKED.\" Are you kidding me? This is the response a representative told us. Makes us think these reviews are 100% accurate, listen to what this hotel representative is telling you. CHECK & READ THEM. We let them know that we would be putting a comment on Tripadvisor for them regarding their quality of customer service. My husband then told the representative to go ahead and keep that $16 (thankfully it was that little) & that it was worth every penny since it means we were not staying there. He let her know that we were SOOOO glad to find out the quality of service they provide PRIOR to the stay. My husband concluded the conversation and told her thanks for the fantastic customer service & hope she enjoys working in a bug infested 'crap hole' of a hotel. Yes, a little rude on our behalf, however you too would get frustrated with the situation. Educate yourself and look around before booking.

My friend called 3 times before we were actually told that it was being fixed. The first 2 calls were answered with \"ok, thank you\". What kind of a response is that? The second problem were the safes in both rooms. Neither of them worked.

This is a huge event weekend and you would think that there would be plenty of staff scheduled. Not to mention that we were being charged $8.75 for use of the safe. So I ended up having to carry my valuables with me for the entire car show weekend. The third problem: our friends had ants in the room by Saturday afternoon. And not just a few. They had to throw food away because ants were crawling in everything. The fourth problem: you have to pay for ice! I am a travel agent and have stayed in hotels all over the world. I have never paid for ice!!! That is just ridiculous! We paid $217.60 per night to stay here. The bathrooms are the equivalent of a Motel 6.

We booked one with a small kitchen and other than it did not have a freezer it was perfect for our needs. The hotel was about ten blocks away from all of the amusements and that made it an easy walk home at night when the kids were exhausted. We called the hotel directly and got a great 5 night special which actually came out cheaper than any online special that we had seen for this hotel.

I have enjoyed coming to this hotel for 9 years, however I was extremely disappointed with my hotel experience this last & final time. Upon entering my non-smoking room I found a cigarette lighter at the head of the bed. I questioned the housekeeper about this, whom recognized the lighter to be owned by one of her coworkers. Later, I discovered a decomposing condom and guaze dressing on the floor at the foot of the bed. I reported it to the manager whom promptly had 2 housekeepers come to the room and sweep them away. Feeling like the room had not been properly cleaned, I spoke to the front desk about a room transfer. The manager said the room transfer seemed unnecessary as the debris on the floor had been resolved with housekeeping. I was persistent and was given a new room. The second room had issues as well. The television did not work, electrical outlets in the kitchenette & front room had no power. There was black mold all around the tub & floor. The bathtub drain did not empty. After 2 calls to the front desk to empty out the tub, a maintenance person came to the room whom resolved the drain problem by using the room's nasty toilet plunger. I can't think of anything that contains more germs than a toilet plunger,..Really!! Frustrated and not scheduled to leave until the following day, I promptly packed up my belongings and set out to talk with the manager. Three face to face attempts over the span of 2 hours was unsuccessful. The manager never showed up for work and the front desk personnel was at a loss as to how to contact him. I was given his voicemail extension, but was unable to leave a message as his mailbox was full.

We chose that hotel despite the \"so-so\" reviews that we read. I wanted to be in a hotel very close to the sidewalk so I wouldn't need to use the car to take a walk on the boardwalk. That's why we decided to stay in this place. Overall it was not bad, but some things annoyed us. Every time someone closed their doors on the same floor, it slammed and the walls shook as if we were in an earthquake. That happened frequently. The towels were not replaced when we requested and the bed was poorly made, the bedsheets were all wrinkled as if they had just covered the messed bedsheet with the comforter. They did not clean the dirty mugs/glasses, and when we called asking them to do it, they said they did not do it. The bathroom is small and the showers are as weak as a little stream. There's only one elevator and it's definitely not the fastest I've ever been. Get used to wait in the line. The only Ice machine of the hotel was broken and the front desk charged us 1 dollar for a bag of ice. This was the first time I've been to a hotel where I had to pay for the ice. The parking lot, depending on how crowded the hotel is, gets full and you have to park 2 blocks away. The rooms are clean and tiled, no carpet, and the beds are ok, which is very important to us. One of the comforters had a huge hole and the bathroom door was damaged as well. The balcony is nice and has a good view. The staff is not rude, although not friendly at all. They seem not oriented to please the customers.The day we checked out, for example, I asked to keep the car in the garage for a little longer, up until 3ish. The guys said they couldn't do it because there were other customers checking in starting @ 3. I tried to argument and ask him to give me a call in case the lot got full but he insisted that I should remove the car by 2 at the latest. I was surprised because there were plenty of empty spaces, and it was the Labor Day Monday, so I really don't think the hotel would be 100% occupied in the night when the summer had officially ended. I took the car out of the parking lot and parked on the street. We usually go to OC and stay in hotels and this was the first time this happened. So, in a nuthsell, there are better options to go in OC, this one is not a \"no-go\" but if you decide to stay there get an extra dose of patience.

I stayed there back in the late 90's and I agree, nothing has been renovated. We arrived about 1:30 and although hotels usually state check in at 3, I've never had a problem checking in early.

We had to park across the street in the overflow lot, not too happy. We had a room overlooking the pool, which was good and bad. Good to people watch but bad when you wanted to go to bed because it was VERY loud after hours due to the pool bar. Friday night especially, very loud, very late. (if it wasn't a family vacation I wouldn't have minded and have probably been down there myself). It did sound like fun. The hallways were pretty loud late too but maybe cuz we had the vending machines right outside our door.

They left us extra towels without asking when they noticed we had 4 in the room. The air conditioning worked great but the water pressure in the shower was the pits! Another MAJOR complaint.....we got up at 6:30am and ALL of the pool chairs already had towels on them!! We went to the waterpark because there would have been no where to sit. That shouldn't be allowed. Obviously these people aren't showing up until 9 or 10 am....you pay $300 a night and you can't even get a chair by the pool....that was a little intolerable.

We were able to put the kids to bed and stay up watching tv, sitting on the balcony as late as we wanted without disturbing their sleep. Another positive was the wait staff by the pool, they were always friendly and accomodating. BAD: I had read about the ice situation and was really dissapointed to see it to be true. I've never stayed at a hotel that charged you for ice, I wasn't about to buy a bag of ice just to have a cold glass of soda. The hotel is also divided into 2 seperate buildings, if you stayed in the building not directly on the boardwalk you had no outside shower or hose to rinse the sand off before going inside unless of course you wanted to climb the stairs to the pool area and rinse off there, not an easy feet with 3 small kids and a bunch of sand toys. Another complaint was the Blue Fin Bar and pool area was open to the public, I understand the bar wanting more business than just the hotel however, since it's open to the pool it meant a lack of pool chairs for the paying hotel guests. Not to mention that the pool was being used by their sister hotel across the street, Too many people too small a pool deck meant you had to get up bright and early for a lounge chair if you weren't going to the pool. The biggest bad thing was the parking, there aren't enough parking spots at the hotel, a few across the street and the remainder a 2 block walk away, which is a realy pain with the kids. Problem is people were allowed to park illegally next to the office and therefore those who were parked legally had a hard time getting in and out of the parking spaces. I understand peoples frustrations with having to walk 2 blocks to their cars but we were all in the same boat and having to shimmy in and out of a parking space to keep from hitting an illegally parked car was a bit frustrating.

I've never stayed at a hotel that did not have an ice machine. Clearly customer service is not a priority here. Lying to guests demonstrates that. I know I did not pay to stay at the Waldorf Astoria, but the staff could have been more helpful and courteous when assisting me with a problem with our room.

The noise was unbelievable, even after they closed people moved outside and partied right in front of the place AND our hotel.

The furniture is just as I remembered it, may have been new comforters although mine had cigarette burns all through it. They also claimed to have re tiled the bathroom, once again if they did they need to get their money back, the tiles did not meet up very well and they didn't look any different than before, maybe they just replaced some bad ones. Things that were MOST difficult for me, other than no sleep, the drawer that they put in the kitchen area was not big enough to fit the silverware tray (??) so they laid it on the bottom of the cupboard under the sink, I have had recent surgery and can't bend so there was no way for me to get to these, an unexpected problem. Next they had safes installed in the rooms, nice idea, but once again putting them near the floor is not very accessible got me and I am sure many others.

First off, the hallways reeked of something terrible, can't really describe the smell -- maybe a mix of paint and trash? The bathroom was pretty gross -- there was rust or something dark on the bottom of the bath tub that couldn't be washed away (very unsightly) and it was clearly an old bathroom with some weird dried glue stuff or something on the edges of the sink. The bed covers were also stained, which was not comforting. Pillows were all different, some lumpy, some fatter, some flatter, not very nice pillows. Internet was super slow. The housekeeping decided not to clean our room the 2nd day because one person was in there when they arrived and instead they dropped off 3 towels (it was a 4-person room). With all the sand from the beach and dirty towels, it would have been really nice to have the place cleaned! On top of that, there wasn't enough parking one evening and we had to search for parking on the street. Oh, and there was a fire alarm one of the mornings at around 7:30 AM so we had to evacuate.

If you are checking in/out and you have your bags, coolers and groceries - good luck. It is a tight fit. The ice machine was broken, but if it was working, bring money because you have to pay for ice. \"Lucky\" for us - they were selling bags of ice for $3, the same size you can get at the grocery store for $1,79. We had to ask for sheets for the pull out bed twice, once around 4:00p (so we would have them at bed time later) and again around 9:00p. When the sheets were finally delivered, they were shoved in my face and the boy delivering them left quickly, no hello, no smile, no eye contact. He was obviously annoyed to have to deliver sheets. When we went to bed, both king beds had sand in the sheets. I have been going to OC MD for almost 20 years, I'm not sure how you get sand in clean unused sheets. The morning of check out there were signs in the elevator advising guests of extended checkout rates. We were going to the beach before leaving for home so we thought extended checkout was a good idea. When we asked about it, we were told our room didn'ty apply for extended checkout. That makes no sense - do you want the extra $45 dollars or not? So we went back to our room at 10:45am to gather our things to be out by 11:00am. Only the keys didn't work anymore because they are programmed to expire at check out, which is fine, but it wasn't 11:00a yet. So I went back to the desk to have the key reprogrammed. The grumpy girl at the desk reprogrammed the key, but as I said, her personality has much to be desired. Which is something I don't need when I am paying $269 a night. How about a smile? How about not acting like you are doing me a favor? How about opening your mouth and speaking a lilttle louder? I don't know her name but she is the brunette with the long bob.

I will say that given the nasty reviews I would not have considered staying here if not for the decent price and 3rd night free and the proximity to the boardwalk.

It was fairly clean, and I did NOT notice any \"slime\" or \"mold\" as mentioned by some previous posters. The beds were quite comfy (and I am a fussy, fidgety sleeper) and there was minimal noise, but the hotel was not very full as it was the beginning of the week in Sept. This 2 room suite had a view of the ocean and it was a decent sized balcony where the 3 of us could easily sit and yes it did have a fairly nice OV. The front desk people were nice and pleasant. My only issue with this hotel is that the floors are indeed SLIPPERY when wet and my 62 year old sister FELL in the bathroom a 4a.m. ......... she slipped on a wet spot. There have been previous posters remark about the floor; either that it is \"gross or grundgy\" or \"very slippery\". I can attest by our personal experience that the floors are a slippery tile. Easier to maintain and clean when you are a beachfront location and lots of messy people may be dragging in sand and slop, but also more than coincidence if several posters, including my sister, said they fell.

I was not informed when booking the two bedroom suite that it was on Baltimore Ave. I was told pool view and partial ocean view, which it did have. We were not happy about the longer walk to the Boardwalk and beach, since I had my elderly mother with me who just went through a major cancer surgery and was unable to walk far distances. That is why I chose to stay at the Tidelands in the first place....big surprise when we were put in the other building on the 5th floor. No I can only vouch for my stay, but I did take pictures and you can judge for yourself. The room was DIRTY!!!!! It looked like it was not dusted in weeks prior to our arrival, the floors were a flithy mess and we found clothes and candy in the drawers. Not a big deal. When we told the staff down stairs they immediately contacted the head of housekeeping. The next day our refridgerator stopped working. We called down again. The head of housekeeping was up within a 1/2 hour to address the refridgerator issue as well as the other issues. She was called at home the night before. She was very dissappointed and promised to fix the situation completely. We had a new refridgerator delivered and she was to tell our housekeeper about the problems and they should be fixed. The floor was then cleaned. But even though Norma, the head of housekeeping, was to speak with her staff on that floor, her staff obviously did not listen. We never got the extra towels promised, the floor of the room was never cleaned, the bathroom mirror was never cleaned, one day I had the same dirty kitchen towels left. By day 4 we were so completely disgusted we couldn't wait to get out of there. You could not walk on the floor with out shoes or your feet or socks would get completely dirty. Oh, I forgot, the toaster made the smoke alarms go off.....and my husband had to remove them from the walls to get them to stop. No one ever checked out this situation either. Yes, it was no big deal, but if it was, no one seemed to be aware of it. Also the air conditioner from the hall leaked water on the floor in front of our door and made a big mess when you would walk in it(not knowing it was there)and drag that into the room. I have included pictures of where the refridgerator was dragged in the room on Sunday and the floor was never cleaned....we left Wed. and I took these pictures. The pictures are of the corner of the floor, the black mold on the ac, some brown stain on the bottom bed sheet, also not properly put on the bed, crumbs on the floor from Sunday, and marks from the refridgerator being dragged in and never clean. The staff down stairs were nice and tried to be helpful, but I can only speak for the people I dealt with on that day, and the staff changed daily. Will we be staying there again? NO.

Both times prior to our last 6 night/ 7 day stay have been enjoyable and our trip the first week of August was no exception. Needless to say, all of the negative reviews on here had us very concerned prior to our arrival bit I am happy to report that the hotel is just as nice as it has been in the past. We did have a couple of glitches that will prevent me from awarding 5 stars however, the issues we're taken care of nearly immediately and had no lasting effect on our vacation. Myself, my fiance, my mom, and my dad all stayed in a 2 bedroom suite, 5th floor. When we first arrived, my mom called down for extra pillows and they we're delivered within 10 minutes of the request... Same can be said for the extra towels we requested. We loaded up our fridge with our sodas and beers around 5 pm and upon our return to the room around 10, we realized that the fridge was not cold. We called down to the front desk and a maintence person came up and informed us that it was froze up and that housekeeping would be able to defrost it in the am. Slightly a pain, but certainly not a huge deal. House keeping did indeed fix the fridge and it ran perfectly for the rest of the week. The next evening we returned to our room and we noticed that our AC unit wasn't nearly as cold as it should have been. I made another call to the desk and a friendly maintence man was at our door within minutes. He also informed us that our AC was frozen up (see a trend? Haha!) and would be back to fix it... Not even 5 minutes later, he was back with new AC filter in hand and all was up and running within 5 more minutes. Beyond those issues, our suite was a spacious room that comfortably housed 4 adults for the week. Being on the 5th floor gave us a great view of both the ocean and bay too! Our only gripes in regards to the room is that the first bedroom (closest to the hallway) has a.) paper thin walls (we think there was a luggage cart derby in the hall!) and b.) that there should be another dresser in the room. The pool bar serves some yummy drinks but during our time there this past week, the kitchen unexpectadly closed due to health department issues. We believe that it had something to do with the fridge and grill not being up to code but the only explanation we received for the shut down and then subsequent limited menu was a \"kitchen revamp\". Some reviews on here have mentioned that the tile floors are a pain... I feel the opposite. I like that there are no grimey carpets to have sand lodged in. The tile does get slippery when wet and you will end up with some pebbles on your feet if you walk barefoot. My quick solution... Bring slippers. Problem solved. In regards to parking... It's a crapshoot. Either you are lucky enough to score a parking spot in one of the main lots, or you have to hoof it a couple of blocks to the over flow lot. Not a huge deal in our eyes because we parked our car and then use the bus system to get to places off the boards or use the tram for places on the boards. I know this is a long review but with all the negativity on here about TCH, I figured a positive review would help.

We go to OC every year and normally stay at The Holiday Inn & Suites - 17th street (wonderful, above average hotel), but decided to try somewhere different. This hotel is located on 5th street - absolutely NO PARKING. We stayed in a suite because we had many people staying; needless to say we had two cars. Their policy is one parking permit per room. Okay I understand that but we couldn't even find parking for one car, and my car was across the highway down a side street after an HOUR - (no exaggeration) of driving around. This made us decide to stay in the immediate area and not use our cars to go anywhere in the area, which was confining. So the last night we decided to go for dinner farther away and upon returning again we ran into the same problem - no parking. This time our first car found a spot at the hotel right away and I eventually came to the hotel after about 45 minutes of driving around looking for a spot. I found one at the hotel and asked the hotel staff if I could possibly stay there, it was our last night, could I please just stay there I had been riding around for quite a while. They said \"no\" their policy was one permit per room. I told them that the Holiday Inn and Suites on 17th street had the same policy and out of good customer service they gave us a second permit. They said \"well their manager must have approved it\". They weren't very helpful or concerned in any way and they had vacancies - so it's not like every room had a permit. On another note, for a suite that eight people would be staying in there were four towels (no hand or face towels) and no sheets for the pull-out sofa bed. Room was clean. Did not like tile floors - I read that in a review before we went and didn't really pay attention to it, but with sand and wet feet it can be dangerous as well as not very \"comfy\" I guess. Also for a suite with that many people there was one bathroom. Sometimes there's an additional vanity area outside the bathroom - not so here, so if you have many adults going plan accordingly to get your turns in the bathroom. So, in general I would give this hotel 2 out of 5 stars and if I may recommend the Holiday Inn and Suites on 17th street (5 stars +).

We were on the 3rd floor ocean block so we did have a small view of the ocean and boardwalk which was nice. One annoying thing was the fact the shower had to be on for about 10 or 15 mins before the water got hot and the water pressure was low.

Our children are 14 & 11 and being able to walk up and down the Boardwalk and find something to do for all ages is what brought us back. We also were able to WALK to Bay area and rode The Adrenaline for the 2nd year in a row & loved it. The hotel was pretty much on key to the ratings, pros & cons, that we had read before we left. We stayed in a 2 room King Suite on the 3rd floor facing Baltimore Ave. The bedding & towels were clean, however we did have to ask for more towels the 1st night & they were brought to us immediately with a smile. I did leave $2 a day with a note of our request & never had to ask again. The dishes that they provide were not cleaned to my expectations so we went to the grocery store & bought plastic. The coffee maker, toaster & microwave were all that we used & all worked fine. It would have been nice if they would have told us that they only provide the \"coffee maker\" we could have taken coffee & filters with us. Since they didn't (and don't most hotels offer their little sample packs with the machine??) we also bought that at the store. I was a little disappointed with the housekeeping of the tile floors. I realize it's hard to keep sand out and we did our best to rinse off before entering, but our room had mounds of sand from previous occupants and it was never cleaned up. We wore our shoes all the time. (Next year the Dust Buster will join us)The room had a \"scent\" but I had taken a Plug-In along (in case of getting a smokey room as a previous review stated) and that helped out a lot. The beds were very \"hard\", but clean bedding, so we survived.

I went with my husband and daugher who is 2 years old. We had a wonderful time. I must say that I was in a total panic when my husband suggested that we book a spur of the moment trip to Ocean City. I panicked because we have stayed at total dives at Myrtle Beach for slightly less money. I figured the hotels at O.C. would not be kept up, I was wrong! I have not stayed in Ocean City since 1987 when I was very young. It seems as though a lot of the city has been overhauled. I looks great! I had originally booked a large family themed resort further down the ocean and after reading horrible reviews, I took advantage of their cancellation policy and cancelled. I then found a super price on Orbitz for the Tidelands. I do know of 2 families that have recently stayed there and they both enjoyed their stay. I took a chance with the Tidelands and almost had a panic attack after we booked because of some of the reviews on this site. I promised that if all went well, I would write a positive review. All went well and here is my positive review! We had a 2 room suite with 2 king sized beds. The room was huge and we had plently of room for all of our luggage, toys, etc. We overlooked Baltimore Avenue which was fine with me... it was last minute. The suite was painted pink and it did have tile floors, which I loved. I don't even want to think about what is in the carpet of those other hotels that don't use tile. It was nicely furnished with dark furniture. As I said, I have paid the same amount per night for dismal rooms with way less space. The room was clean, cute, and felt very tropical. I had no problems with the decor or the layout of the room. It was more than adequate. The staff at the front desk were all very nice and helpful. I even asked to see the ocean front rooms if we ever stay there again and I was given a tour. They too were nice. The housekeeping staff was also nice and helpful. The location was perfect and we could not have been more convenient to the boardwalk. It was perfect for my toddler. Some things that others have had problems with, thankfully did not happen to us. The parking lot was fine. Of the times we took our car out, we only had to go to the overflow lot, which is one block away, once. The garage under the hotel was just fine. Mostly everyone has trucks or SUV's so that is of course what you'll see there. The pool on the front building was undergoing renovations so we did only have one small pool on the back building where the grill is located. The pool was large enough to accomodate the guests. If I had to name one \"negative\" it was that there was an overwhelming smell of garbage permeating the air at the pool. The back of the pool faces an alley which has many dumpsters and I think that is where the smell was coming from. Not what I wanted to smell at the pool on the beach. It seemed better on the last day, perhaps the garbage man had come. A good perk was that at the pool, a fun clown named Lolipop came and made balloon animals for the kids... for free. That was fun. I hope this helps. I drove up and down the strip and looked at other hotels and I loved this one.

Everything else was lower $200 and up when shopping online. I booked our room as an OceanView room with double Queen beds. When we arrived I was a little startled to find out that my online reservation through the internet had not gone through. Fortunately the manager said that they still had a room available for us and he seemed to be willing to find accomodations for us even if only a better room had been available. Room - Just a few comments so that you know what to expect. The ocean view turned out to be a view of the ocean from an angle down the road. I guess I was expecting too much for the price I paid and maybe the rooms right on the boardwalk were much more expensive than ours. I believe we stayed in the older part of the hotel although it was painted nicely. The room was clean on the inside. However the outside windows were dirty to point that you could not see out of them. We wet a couple of hand towels and wiped them down ourselves. It came with 2 queen beds (I guess what Hotels consider queens) which were too soft. Really to point of sagging a little. But the night's sleep was ok. The room did have a refrig and microwave, but no table to eat on and no chairs in the room. So you had to eat on the floor or the bed. The room had no coffee maker and no ice bucket (This is like a gimme at most hotels). Luckily I had a mini cooler to put ice in and soon found that ice cost .25 cents for about a half mini-cooler worth. The bathroom seemed clean enough and you did get a iron and hair dryer. Oh yeah - just like everyone says - there are no fitted sheets. They slide all over the place during the night. Oh no wireless internet access (Although the nearby comfort inn's signal showed up - it required login). Service - Everyone seemed polite and helpful. We forgot a toothbrush and asked if they had any complimentary ones at the front desk (They didn't). But they pointed us to the nearest convenient store (2 blocks away). Turned out the little market was 24hours and offered grill food and other little handy things you might need. Yes parking is cramped, unless you are lucky enough to park between the buildings like we did and there are a limited number of spots. (There are two buildings one old and one new). I think the overflow lot is a couple of blocks away. Location - this is really the best part of you get for your stay. You are right on the boardwalk near everything. Subway is 2 blocks away,Baskin-Robins is righ there as well as Shenanigans Irish Pub. Overall - In my opinion this Hotel is average. It's also very tough to determine the type of room you are getting from the website. I chose this hotel originally based on other reviewer's comments. If you have to pay alot of money to stay here, I wouldn't. Anything above $200 I would be searching for a Holiday Inn or Hilton or something. Although granted I did not stay in there more expensive suites so my point of view could be skewed. I think there are alot of little things that it could improve upon to be top notch. Services that you expect at a Hotel that I think would not cost them much and would be a good investment to keep people coming back (Free ice, fitted sheets, better website description of rooms, table to eat on, cofee maker, complimentary toothbrush).

However, since I wouldn't consider booking a hotel without reading reviews on tripadvisor.com, I assume if you're reading this, you'd like information on the property provided by someone who stayed there, letting you make an informed decision. My husband and I stayed in an OF room 9/2-9 and it wasn\u2019t the best or the worst hotel we\u2019ve stayed at in OC. The room was of a decent size with an adequate amount of drawer space. The draperies, bedspreads and furniture were all in good condition \u2013 and we liked the cornice over the sliders that helped keep out the light in the morning. The web site says the rooms were recently renovated, which was evident, but it was a surface overhaul. The repainted room was marred by the rusted and molded venting in the sleeping portion of the room and the mold on the ceiling. While the bathroom and kitchenette areas may have been repainted, they were not remodeled and showed signs of wear. The slider to the balcony was so difficult to open and close we just stopped trying, which is a shame considering you pay extra for a direct oceanfront room. It took two days, but a note to the maid resulted in getting a lightbulb replaced and the safe unlocked so we could use it, which we appreciated. Housekeeping was lackluster and uneven. Aside from the floor, I don\u2019t believe the bathroom was cleaned during the entire week of our stay. The room had a kitchenette (small refrigerator, microwave and two electric burners). There was a frying pan, a few plates and utensils and glasses. If there was an ice bucket in the room, I didn\u2019t see it. Other reviewers have mentioned numerous things that I\u2019ll list here just for further confirmation: - The sheets do come off the mattress during the night. - I liked the tile flooring, but it does make it tough to get the sand off your feet, which becomes an issue if they don\u2019t change your sheets daily, which was my experience. - There are no blankets on the beds and none in the room. Just the sheet and bedspread . No extra pillows \u2013 and what are provided are pretty flat. We each needed to use two. - No name toiletries provided upon arrival are all you'll get, even if you use them up - bring your own. - There is not enough parking directly at the hotel and those spots are EXTREMELY tight, but they do have auxiliary/overflow parking 2 blocks over at 5th & Philadelphia Ave. This is not an unusual situation, as land is at a premium in OC and I\u2019ve encountered the same thing at other OF hotels. No one objected when we parked briefly right outside the lobby door while we unloaded our vehicle after checking in. This is one benefit of staff that is apathetic. - Only one elevator in the OF building. - The hallways/corridors were warm and smelled funky. We initially attributed that to the power having been out for the 14 hours before our arrival due to a storm (Ernesto), but they remained the same throughout our week's stay. Either we were extremely lucky with quiet fellow guests or the hotel has decent soundproofing, which is not the case at many OC hotels. We heard little noise from either the boardwalk or other rooms. The fire alarm went off one late afternoon during our stay and the alarm sound is not very loud, nor does it sound like any fire alarms I\u2019ve heard before. I was taking a bath with the fan running and didn\u2019t hear it at all (but I am hard of hearing). Seriously, if your hearing isn\u2019t good, make sure you stay with someone of normal hearing. We evacuated and only knew it was OK to return inside by hearing a hotel staff person talking on a cell phone. I pursued them and asked if we could go inside and was told yes, but they made no effort to communicate this information to the guests standing outside. Aside from the balcony door, everything was in working order in the room. Good A/C, refrigerator kept things cold, bathtub drained, toilets flushed, TV worked. I didn\u2019t get the sense the hotel was well run or managed. While they weren\u2019t rude, the young people encountered at the front desk were apathetic and not friendly. You get the impression they're on the defensive (and wonder what they've encountered to make them like this). You were neither welcomed at check in, nor thanked for your patronage at check out \u2013 you were just an interruption from sitting and staring into space and a transaction - there was no interaction other than the request for your name or room number. The hotel isn't exactly security minded, as the stairwell from the 5th street side was unlocked any time of night or day and held open with a large rock most of the time. This means anyone from the street can enter the hotel without going through the lobby, which was convenient for us since the hotel has but one elevator, but be aware of this! The hotel is in a prime location and has the makings of a really wonderful hotel if they just paid a little more attention to the details, had a staff trained in customer service, provided a few additional basic amenities and more than the cursory cleaning effort that consisted of little more than changing the towels and making the bed was made. (I found out after the fact my generous husband was leaving the maid a $5 daily tip, so either tipping isn't a motivator or I'd hate to see what you'd get in the way of cleaning without a tip.) If the interior of the hotel was as well maintained as the exterior of the hotel, this would be a great property. I realize beach properties are difficult to maintain and while this wasn\u2019t what we\u2019d consider a well run or maintained property, it wouldn\u2019t prevent me from staying again \u2013 but only if other more preferred properties in the same price range weren\u2019t available (which is why we stayed here this year). I believe you have to lower your standards a bit at any beach location, as it's so hard to combat the elements. While this property had it's deficiencies, it's still probably among the nicer moderately priced hotels. The bottom line is that the hotel was OK, nothing really objectionable but it didn't impress us either.", "Date": "September 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cTIdelands pros & cons\u201d", "Author": "missush", "ReviewID": "UR5763195", "Content": "My family stayed at the hotel from 8/28-8/31, this was our 2nd stay. I have to agree with previous posters...if you want to be near all the action of the b'walk, this is definitely the place to be. The weekday rate during this time was very reasonable and you can't beat being literally a few steps from the beach. We were in a 2-rm suite on the 4th floor with a poolview. The room was just OK. I noticed some of the same issues I had from 2005--the panel was missing from the fake drawer front below the sink; water pressure in shower horrible; the walls needed to be repainted; the fitted sheet issue; the broken ice machine; the exit doors leading to the parking lot not locking properly; the bad parking situation. I, too, was concerned about how well they cleaned the tile floors. Our floor had sand on it when we first walked in and it was never completely cleaned during our stay. I noticed a small sand pile in the bathroom on our first day and by check out time it was still there which leads me to believe that housekeeping is not doing a thorough job. Our toilet bowl needed a good scrubbing and the tub had a ring in it from the moment we walked in. It was never cleaned. On our third day, I dropped an earring behind one of the nightstands and discovered a half-eaten piece of bread/roll. Again, housekeeping needs to be addressed. Management would be wise to spend a night in their own hotel to get a feel for what their customers' experience would be like. Or make random inspections. Many of my complaints and those of others are not hard to solve. Overall, the hotel is not bad. I've seen worse and paid more. I'd probably stay there again, but I will be doing research on other hotels for next year. It's a shame because they have many things in their favor--price, location, but they don't seem to put much of their profits back into the place.

Rooms are fairly large and all have a good size balcony. Our room had a tile floor which is easier to clean and cooler but also makes it hard to keep sand out of the beds. I used a damp bathmat in front of the beds that you could wipe your feet off before getting into bed. AC unit worked great. Negatives are parking. They have limited parking on site (which was full) and an overflow lot two blocks east that had about two spots left in it. The overflow lot is a little inconvenient if you want to be able to access stuff in your car like boogie boards, etc. rather than lug them back and forth to your room which may be 5 floors up. Also, they don't have any outdoor showers that are convenient, only a foot shower near the main lobby. A previous reviewer mentioned the lack of fitted sheets, I agree this is a problem that should be easily fixed if they wanted to. After reading his review I specifically looked at the sheets and they are too short and it was a constant problem with the sheets coming off of the bed at night. The rooftop pool is extremely small and the larger pool, near the suites is adjacent to a bar and grill that is open to the public. Location may make the Tidelands better than average depending on your needs, but in all other aspects it is average. I would not hesitate to stay there again, but then again there is nothing \"special\" about it that would make me loyal to them either.", "Date": "August 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Baltimore, Maryland", "Title": "\u201cStayed for about 10 minutes\u201d", "Author": "peachkins", "ReviewID": "UR5703258", "Content": "We were extremely disappointed in this hotel. So unhappy, in fact, that we left before staying a single night. We were supposed to have an ocean-view room, and at $300 a night we wanted to see and hear the ocean. The hotel is divided into two main buildings: one that is right on the boardwalk where the oceanfront rooms are located, and the other is on the main road. We figured we would at least be in the building closest to the beach. We were wrong. Our \"ocean view\" was a two inch glimpse of the ocean between two other buildings. Our room basically overlooked the parking lot next door and the main road. The traffic was extremely noisy, and when you're staying in a room with young children this can be a problem. And who wants to sit on the balcony and listen to all that? Not that I would sit on the furniture that was out there. It was filthy. The room was also disappointing. The only good things about it were the king-sized beds. The room just didn't seem clean. A lot of reviewers on here say they liked the tile floors, but I have to disagree. I thought the tile was kind of gross-I mean I have to wonder how they clean it. Do they just sweep the loose stuff up or do they actually (hopefully) mop and dry the whole thing. I wouldn't have felt comfortable walking on it in my bare feet. Again, it just didn't seem clean. To top it off, the front was missing off the bathroom sink. Very attractive. If this was supposed to be a newly renovated room I shudder to think of what the old room looked like. Perhaps I'm seeming a bit picky, but keep in mind people are paying more than $300 a night during the summer to stay at this place. After seeing the room and our \"ocean view,\" we decided to call another hotel down the street that we had stayed at before. The only reason we had booked the Tidelands was because our other hotel required a 3-night minimum and, at the time, we didn't meet it. We had changed our plans to include a 3 night stay, so our regular hotel was able to accomodate us on incredibly short notice. At our regular hotel-the Quality Inn Beachfront-we got a gorgeous second-floor, oceanfront suite with a private balcony and an incredible oceanfront view. We ended up getting this room for less $ over the 3 nights than what the Tidelands cost. We ended up checking out before we stayed a single hour at the Tidelands. They are still planning on charging us for the 3 nights we reserved there and we intend to dispute the charge, since the hotel has a strict no-refund policy. All the credit card asked for was proof that we had checked out before staying a full night. Getting any of the staff there to do this was like pulling teeth. Needless to say, we will never reserve a room there again.", "Date": "August 24, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashburn, VA", "Title": "\u201cA little disappointed\u201d", "Author": "susanjc", "ReviewID": "UR5700363", "Content": "We just got back from the Tidelands and were a little disappointed in the hotel. We stayed in room 420 which is the 2 room suite. I had stayed in the same type of room 2 years ago and at that time the room was very nice. The rooms are starting to look run down, badly needing new paint, mold on the bathroom wall. I know OC is expensive but for $932 for 3 nights you expect a little cleaner. Also when the maid cleaned our room she never made the other bed, even though my daughter slept in it and didn't give us shampoo or more than 3 towels. Also if you book a corner room which 420 is there are side windows which would be nice if they had curtains that shut out the light. All they have are white blinds that do not shut out any light. They were fully booked so we couldn't change rooms, so I had to go to Walmart and buy a black sheet and tumb tacks so the sunlight wouldn't shine in at 6 am.

Same goes for pillows, flat as pancakes and no extras. But our maid was nice and took care of us. No fitted sheet, just flat ones, and you woke up on the matress ! Yuk ! My husband said I was being a bed hog, but whenever he got in bed I got sucked in the middle. The balcony was only big enough for 2 people. Not fun when you have 3 teenage girls with you. Had to pay for ice, and they had only one ice machine. and ONE elevator. Talk about slow, our girls took the stairs. No hot water tile falling off, and toilet was over flowing, good thing they left the plunger next to it !!! I think this was the first vacation where I wanted to go home !!

Our room was a two room suite on the 5th floor. The room was nice (ceramic tile floors, jacuzzi tub big enough for two). But what made the trip was staff. When we arrived it was really a pretty miserable night, which was followed by dreary morning. When asked the desk guy basically gave us the whole Julie McCoy rundown on what to do, where to go & what to eat.

The hotel is in need of some scerious updating. The ocean front room we stayed in was in need up repairs, the walls had stains, the bathroom toliet was always running, and we had to keep fixing the chain on the toliet so you could flush. The shower walls were missing tiles, and by the time you were done showing you were standing in above ankle water. They don't always replace soap, shampoo, toliet paper and I wonder how good they are at changing sheets. And from guests we talk to their rooms were along the same lines. I know you are thinking if it was so bad why did we continue to stay. Well it was Sunfest weekend and every hotel was sold out, we didn't have options. We stayed 3 nights in this room then when the weekend came we had to move to another room for 3 more nights in the other building. Which granted was a million times nicer but still not up to par. I complained to the manager that we wanted to leave and I wanted refunded for the unused nights, but they flattley refused, they would not give me a refund. He said he would personaly make sure the new room we were moving into was cleaned and spotless. Well there cleaning staff stinks, they no extras. For example we found a pair of dirty underware left in one of the dresser drawers. Some cleaning they do. I highly recommend staying away, especially during the spring to fall season when the hotels employees foreigners for the summer that can barely speak english.

We (2 adults and 2 children) stayed in one of their suites on August 4 thru August 11. The room was clean and comfortable with a ceramic tiled floor. However, it was relatively small when compared to other suites I've stayed in. It had a small kitchenette in a short hallway separating the two bedrooms. The kitchenette consisted of a small refrigerator (without a freezer) and two-element range next to a sink. On the countertop around the sink was a coffee maker and toaster. There was also a small microwave oven. The kitchenette was cramped and not particularly useful for cooking a dinner, but was okay for making breakfast in the morning. The two bedrooms each had a king-sized bed. The larger bedroom also had a queen-sized sleep sofa. The balcony was attached to the larger bedroom. Ours overlooked the busy street below, and was not good for sitting out in the evening. The larger bedroom also featured a small table useful only for small meals. The bathroom was off the short hallway between the rooms. It featured a large mirror over the vanity and a jacuzzi. We did not experience any of the issues with noise or problems with the hotel staff like some of the other reviewers complained about. The staff was generally responsive to our needs. Parking was not the best, however. The hotel has some parking under and around it. There is also a remote lot a little over a block away. Fortunately, the hotel's great location allows you to not have to drive too much. There were usually no open spots around the hotel itself except in the late morning hours around check out time. I had to park one time in the remote lot before moving to an open hotel spot in the late morning, and I noticed that the remote lot was full when I moved my car. I can see how some people might have problems finding an open space if they drive a lot. Generally, my slightly above-average rating is due to the great location at 5th street and the boardwalk and to its king-sized beds.
