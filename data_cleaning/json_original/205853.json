However, the hotel is a 3 to 5-minute walk from any drop-off point and with rolling luggage, this is not a comfortable walk to due sections of cobblestone and the typical narrow Roman sidewalks. This was the 1st trip to Rome with my now wife, and she was very uncomfortable wheeling her luggage, and her bag was rather small. The hotel itself, like many in Europe, is located in a building that houses other residences/businesses, ergo, it's a not solely dedicated to the hotel. This is fine, and often times charming, but you will be walking up stairs with your bags to reach reception or taking the tiny elevator to the proper floor. Checking in was easy, the service typically Italian and warm (the smaller, cheaper hotels always seem to have the best service for some reason). Reception is located in the same area as where you'd have breakfast. THE ROOM: As other travelers have noted, these rooms are bare bones and simple. But I should mention a few things. First, the rooms are BASIC, which is common for Rome in this price range (however, it should be noted you CAN find slightly more charming hotels in this price range, see the Domus Ester in Campo de Fiori). The rooms have hard tile floors. We noticed this led to movement by the bed when we used it as the bed did not have rubber feet to prevent this. This can be very awkward, to say the least. The bathrooms, as others have noted, are small, but again very typical. On the plus side, the room was very clean and had large windows with views onto the street, and this being Rome, most views are interesting. Also, it is quiet given the quiet nature of the neighborhood. THE LOCATION: I have stayed in this area twice on vacation in Rome (due to the prices) and afterwards lived and worked there. Many people on here talk about the location being only 10 or 20 minutes from major sights by foot. But coming from a family that has members with disabilities, and now having lived very close to here, there are some things to note... First, this hotel is located on the Vatican side of the Tiber. For most tourists (especially first-timers or families), besides the Vatican or Castel Sant' Angelo, none of the popular tourist attractions are in this area. Even the Vatican is a good 10-minute walk from the hotel (and I do mean normal walking pace, those reviewers who said it was a 5-minute \"stroll\" must stroll very fast). Case in point, my wife and I lived in the Campo de Fiori area literally a 5-10 minute walk to the Castel Sant' Angelo directly opposite it, on the opposite side of the river and closer to all the major sights, right in the historic center. Our home was a good 15-minute walk (if not more) to this hotel. Our home was a 10-15 minute walk to the Trevi Fountain and 15-20 to the Coliseum (I made this walk every day to my studio and it is not a comfortable walk as the straightest shot is Corso Vittorio Emmanuelle, a major thoroughfare and very busy). So add that 15 from our home to any of the other times. We are now talking 30-40 to the Coliseum. I honestly do not know how someone \"strolls\" there in 20 minutes. Second, along these lines, if you've been out all day sightseeing, walking here is the last thing you'll want to do. Luckily, Piazza Cavour is a major bus hub, but in actuality, if it's late in the evening or you just don't want to try to figure out the bus system (which can be confusing), you're going to end up taking a cab back here and that's going to cost you over 10 euros (and sometimes 20) from any of the major tourist sights. The point is, while the area is nice, it is NOT convenient for the average tourist, IMHO. Third, the block the hotel is on and those surrounding are DEAD AT NIGHT. They are safe, don't get me wrong, but if you're a worrier, single woman, or are letting your children on the loose by themselves while you rest, you might take that into account. One positive thing: there a few banks in the area meaning finding an ATM is not hard. FOOD: Others have noted the food options, but there are some places within a 5-7 minute walk where you can purchase pizza, sandwiches, wine, etc. This area also borders the Prati neightborhood, which is a main residential area of the city and has a wide variety of shops and food choices. If you're looking to see some of Rome away from the tourists, this is a good choice. The hotel does offer the usual breakfast of cold cuts, breads, cheeses, cereals and coffee. And it is solid, if unspectacular. But the fact that it's free is definitely a plus as this is by far the most convenient way to get some food in your stomach in this area early in the morning. FINAL THOUGHTS: Some on here have called this a 1-star hotel. In truth, most 3-star hotels and those in this price range in Rome will be along these lines. Do not expect much in the way of amenities, but do know that for their average rates (60-80 euros in high season, 45-65 in low is what I find skimming random dates right now), you will be getting a clean and comfortable hotel that will save you money if you are willing to do some walking. However, if you are elderly, are traveling with young kids, or otherwise have trouble getting around, this hotel is NOT for you. You would be much better served by spending more and staying in the Piazza Navona area, as it is equidistant from many attractions.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Roatan, Honduras", "Title": "\u201cBEWARE, BEWARE!\u201d", "Author": "cpds", "ReviewID": "UR127665131", "Content": "This hotel canceled our room reservations, last minute ... simply because they could apparently get more $$ for our room.

The maid had already told the manager she was ill and she came to the room asking if their was anything at all they could do, to just let them know. On the day she was resting they told us to go and enjoy our plans they would take care of her and took our mobile number.

This is far beyond what you'd expect from a hotel and we would like to thank all the staff for a perfect holiday. We would not hesitate to go back and stay there. We mainly ate at the 'La Francescana Ristorante' because it was near and the food was so good. The steaks are excellent and also the ravioli. The waiter Carlo took good care of us with our terrible Italian! We also had excellent pasta at 'Hosteria Dei Bastioni' restaurant just outside the Vatican. a good, family establishment with staff that make you feel like family they haven't seen for a while.

My girlfriend was to stay with me for four nights, a friend two and I would stay five. We started in a double room, my friend stayed in a single for one night, girlfriend left and he moved in. I asked if it could be switched to a twin and it was all taken their stride. Thestaff always managed to be professional but friendly and helpful. The real icing on the cake was my friend arrived late one night and I texted him where to meet us when he was on the plane. After not hearing back from him, I remembered he had a new phone and probably had not activated it for abroad. I called the hostel and managed to confuse the hotelier entirely, talking about rooms in different names, someone who may or may not have arrived. I gave directions to where I was and hung up knowing I was not going to see my friend that evening. I was totally wrong. The hotel had looked up the restaurant we were in and had it waiting for my friends arrival, they had drawn the route on the map and made post it notes with directions. They then found my number and called me to confirm the details. Great service! The hotel itself is in a lovely location. There is a brilliant coffee shop round the corner for breakfast on the river. Close to the Vatican, the main drinking and eating area down south and the centre. The hotel is lovely, we were in very small rooms but they were the budget options. The shower was tiny, I had to tell my girlfriend off for putting the shampoo on the ground as I could not bend over to get it! Not a real gripe as the place was clean, friendly and smart. If there was one complaint it was the first night. At night a phone rang non stop for ages somewhere in the building. At times there was also quit loud laughing and shouting from what I thought was staff. As I had had a long day travelling, a good nights sleep was required. The Italians speak loudly in general, so I realise it is a cultural thing! Unfortunately our room was close to reception. The hotel is really close to one of the two city airport bus stops. Which is handy! The other is by termini and the area is a dive.

This posed another issue: The building is old, dark and alone, and you can easily think of someone killing or mugging you on your way up, and you go in alone. 2. The beds were truly awuful. Linen was old and I couldn't decide if dark or dirty. The mattress was all bumpy and after the second day I had a very bad backache and had to flip the mattress around. 3. Although the room was clean, the hallway did have a peculiar not very nice smell. 4. TV had almost no channels in any other language but Italian. 5. The shower\u00b4s curtain was too lond and obstructed the drain, so if you did not keep moving it away every 30 seconds while bathing, the water could overflow.

Get off at Piazza Cavour, look for the white church, and the hotel is about 100m up the road. Other people took the Leonardo Express train from the Airport to Termini Station, then you would have to take a bus or taxi from there.

It was nice being in a slightly less touristy area but being able to walk everywhere. Breakfast was included in our rates and was served from 7am til 10am everyday. Not what we are used to in Australia, but did include two types of cereal, yoghurts, pastries and meats\\cheeses. Could also get a cappucino made for you.

The neighborhood is safe and a mixture of upscale apartments and small hotels and restaurants. You can walk to the Vatican in about 15 minutes or a local bus is just around the corner. Sites such as the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, and the Pantheon are about a 25 minute walk in the other direction. Again, public transportation is inexpensive and readily available. An express commuter train, the Leonardo Express, costing E11 takes you directly from Fiumicino Airport to Termini , the main train station, in about 30 minutes. It is approximately a E15 taxi ride to the hotel from Termini. Those who are willing to utilize public transportation from the airport (Fiumicino) can take the local train, which costs E5.5 from the airport, getting off at Ostiense, it does not stop at Termini, and then taking city bus 280, for E1 to Piazza Cavor. The best option might be an express bus from the Fiumicino airport (E8) which will take you to Piazza Cavour. Look for the location of the express bus stop at baggage claim at the airport. From Piazza Cavour look for a large white church located at the northeast corner. The hotel is on Via M. Dionigi, which begins at the side of the church. However you choose to get there you will find the Sant Angelo to be an excellent place for your Roman adventure. Via M. Dionigi is a relatively quiet side street. The entrance to the hote is unassuming. You enter the building on the ground floor.The lobby is on the first floor which can be reached by a small elevator. Upon arrival you will be greeted by friendly, English speaking staff. During our stay we especially found Claudio, Valerio and Antonio to be most helpful. Jackelyn, who took care of us at breakfast, was a delight. The rooms themselves are a good size for Italy. Americans traveling to Italy for the first time, will find most rooms smaller than what we have at home. Unlike some hotels we have stayed at in Italy, we did not feel cramped. There is sufficient space for clothing in a double dresser and wardrobe. Our room, on the 3rd floor, had a charming and functional floor to ceiling door instead of a window. Street noise was not a problem. The walls appeared to have been freshly painted and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was nicely tiled. Unlike many Italian hotels, there were doors on the shower, rather than simply an open space in the corner of the bathroom. Although the shower space was sufficient for us, a very large person (300lbs+) might feel a bit confined in the shower. Most signifiantly the room, including the bathroom was spotless and well maintained by the housekeeping staff during our 3 night stay. Breakfast is served buffet style in a small dining area adjacent to the lobby. There is an excellent selection of breads, pastrys, meats, cheeses, cereals and juices available. The previously mentioned Jacquelyn will ensure your cappucino, espresso, cafe americano or tea is freshly prepared. This is the 3rd different hotel we have stayed at in Rome and is clearly our favorite. We paid E69 nightly, breakfast included, and found it to be quite a bargain.

I agree with previous reviews that the location is superb but there are much better hotels in the same area. We stayed 5 nights and our room was tiny. The bathroom was so small I would doubt that a person with a slightly larger than normal size, could get into the shower. Big problems to be aware of. 1. There is a huge amount of constuction work going on at the hotel, cleaning roof and walls. Each morning at around 7am we woke to drills and the feeling someone was knocking down our hotel room. We asked the reception about it and they told us there was no work Fri or Sat. We were never told about this work before arriving. 2. Breakfast room is not big enough for all the guests. Each morning you have to wait. On our first morning we waited for 20 mins for a table to be cleared, despite it being empty. When we sat down the waitress starrted clearing aways breakfast food after 8 mins. She said hotels rules were breakfast ends at 10am. If just a shame she was not as efficient at clearing the empty tables and we might have enjoyed a 30 mins breakfast. 3. There is no internet connection, the small computer in the corner was broken. so dont bank on staying connected as the hotel advertises. 4. We had a 5 night stay in a very hot Rome. I had to ask that our sheets were changed on day 4, If I had not asked, I am sure they would not have been changed. 5. Staff were functionally friendly but not helpful. They did the very mimimum and really didnt care more like they were doing you a favour by letting you stay there. A very poor hotel and very low standards maybe due to new owners.

Yes, but for much less. For less than $200. $150 seems reasonalbe for Rome, but we ended up paying 2x that. I'm talking dollars here, not euros. The Good stuff was: 1. The service was good. I always felt I could approach them for about anything if I wanted. Our first morning there we kept blowing out hte power in our room, because brought a high-voltage blow dryer and kept trying to use it. They were very nice aobut it every singel time. 2. The location was great walked pretty much everywhere. Went to the front desk most morning to ask if we needed a bus and they would help us out by telling us yes or no. Then would look up what bus would get us there and back from the bus stop a block away. 3. You need airconditioning in the summer in Rome. Especially when you've walked for most of the day in the heat of the day. 4. Clean, never saw any bugs. Never felt grossed out. 5. Really liked that instead of a window, we had doors that opend up. No balcony, but had metal bars to lean on to see the neighborhood outside. 6. After being warned about how tiny the rooms and bathrooms are in Europe. I considered our room to be pretty roomy as was the bathroom. 7. Really liked that could get a private car to and from hotel. And it was especially nice since it was a Mercedez. Each way was 49 Euros. All I had to do was let the hotel know that I needed a transfer and they arranged everything. The Not so good: 1. The price. I knew before hand that I was going to pay 200 euros for a triple room a night. Just didin't know that the exchange rate was $100=70 Euros. So it ended up being $285 a night. 2. The tiny shower stall. Let's put it this way. Stand and put your hands on your head and elbows stick out. Your elbows will be touching the walls and shower door. And I'm not a tall or big person. Forget bending down to wash your feet. Had to twist and lift to do that one. 3. The non working T.V., but it worked to my advantage. I could barley get my companions out the door, so with a T.V. we never would have seen the city. 4. Now the power does work, just don't take anything that uses to much power. The curling iron did work on a low setting. We were able to charge our phones, cameras, and MP3 players but does take longer. 5. The lift was TINY. With just three people we were packed in. With luggage we had to seperate, because couldn't fit. Most of the time we just used the stairs, it was faster that way. 6. The breakfast wouldn't have paid extra for it, so the good thing was it was included. Your choices are: Breads, cereal, yogurt, a cake, hard dry bread, three choices of thinnly sliced meat and cheeses, fruit from cocktail can, pineapple and orange juice, water, and milk. They have waitress that serve hot chocolate, cappucino, coffee, espresso. 7. Beds are hard and the pillows are a joke. BUt as I understand that is pretty much any hotel in Rome. When you are very tired from sightseeing, though any bed will do. Really liked that the people at the front desk spoke several lanugages. So no problem communicaitng. Just so you know when you arrive you have to take the lift to the first floor where the front desk is located or just take the stairs one flight up.

We were also attracted by the fact that the hotel offers a transfer from the airport to the hotel, which we booked. Unfortunately however, the driver didn't show up at the airport. After several calls to the hotel and an hour wait (in which they told us to wait...) we got a normal cab for 55 euros, which was quicker than the public transport. The hotel is in the Prati district on the Vatican side of the Tiber in a beautiful well-kept 19 th century mansion block. We had our rooms in the belle etage, facing the street. The hotel has obviously been converted from former bourgeois apartments. The ceiling of the room had been lowered from about 4 metres to 3 metres. Coving elements have been replaced. The fittings were in style with the house, and the bathroom was small but modern. There was no minibar and the TV could hardly receive one Italian channel (but we weren't there for telly!) The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful indeed. A great plus point of the Sant'Angelo is its location. You can reach all the major sights of the city by foot within 20 minutes. For the antique sights (Colloseum, Palatine, Forum etc.) take the 87 bus from the next street for the bargain price of one euro a ride. The location is therefore great! One drawback was the paperthin walls - we could hear my mother coughing two rooms away and the maids doing the rooms next-door. The breakfast was basic but substantial, and again, the staff were friendly. In sum, the Sant'Angelo is a good place for sleeping in Rome. It is not a hotel where one would stay during the day. We paid 185 euros per night. In Vienna, Budapest and Paris we paid less for 4 star hotels. So we had doubts whether the Sant'Angelo really offered value for money. But maybe that's just Rome?

The house keeping was good and the rooms were clean. The bedspread had mysterious white crustations and other stains and spills on it. We did not use it. As other people have reported the location is excellent and the restaurant club 700 across the street was good and helpful. The bus 87 worked well to get to the colliseum and the forum. Everything else is walkable. The view from the room was nice of the alley outside. It was nice to lean out the window and people watch at night. The problem I refered to earlier was after we checked out I asked and I handed the man the key I asked if there was a restroom I could use while we wait for the bus. He told me no. He told me restrooms were for guest only. I thought he was kidding. So I said where can I go. He told me to walk down the street and find a place. And that was the last time we saw the hotel.
