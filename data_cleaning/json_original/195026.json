This little gem is located in a strategic position on Kurfurstendamm - one of the most exclusive shopping streets of the city. At walking distance from Charlottengurg and well connected by bus and tube to the rest of the city this no-curfew hotel packed with character is the ideal pied-a-terre for the tourist who is looking to spend more time outside than inside the hotel. I spent 3 nights in a single bed with shared bathroom facilities. The floor was a bit squeaky - bear in mind the hotel was built in the 20's - but the room was clean and room service was provided every day. The mattress - to which I give paramount importance when rating accommodations - got a mere 5 out 10. Also the breakfast, although decent in terms of quality, could be greatly improved by adding a little more variety to it to break the routine. Given the excellent value for money though I would happily swallow the cons and advise this hotel to anyone who is looking for a budget price accommodation in a stunning location of Berlin.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Basel, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cGreat charm, location and value\u201d", "Author": "jst20b", "ReviewID": "UR122290495", "Content": "We stayed in the \" Apartment,\" which is a bit of a misnomer as there us no kitchen.

I was unimpressed by the broken shower door, though it functioned well enough to actually use the shower. The bed wasn't extremely comfortable, and the room was always a little too warm for comfort. The staff was very nice, however, beware of school children. On our last night there were children staying in the room next to us and they were extremely loud after midnight. I had a business meeting the next morning, so I kindly knocked and asked them to quiet down. The children responded by calling our phone repeatedly and loud knocking on the wall. When I complained to the front desk, my wife and I were given another room for the night. It was a very frustrating experience. The complementary breakfast advertised consisted of sliced honeydew, two types of meet, two types of cheese and bread. Dry cereal was also available - nothing to write home about!

Buses also run along the Ku'damm to all other areas of Berlin. We stayed for 3 nights. We all had different style rooms. One of us was fortunate enough to get the one room in our party that had a shower in the room (it literally was in the room too). The other 4 rooms all had wash basins. However there wasn't a toilet in any of the rooms but there are several WCs on each floor and also several shower rooms. We didnt find this a problem and I do know that some of the rooms certainly do have en-suites. Our rooms were basic but clean and towels were changed daily. The beds were comfortable. The colour scheme is a bit bright (orange walls) but the public areas of the hotel are nicely decorated. The staff seemed friendly enough at the reception area and you hand your key in whenever you leave so we could always go back to room whenever we needed to without the rest of group(I know another person identified a problem with keys). The desk is staffed all night and there aren't any restrictions on what time of night you return. Check-out is 12 noon. Breakfast however was basic and the restaurant staff were extremely stressed and disorganised, one morning (saturday) they were finding it difficult dealing with quantity of guests and at one point there was no food left at the buffet. Expect cereal (cornflakes or muesli) cold meats and cheeses, bread and a boiled egg as breakfast menu. It was ok.
