When I finally got in touch with Villa Edera, they were unwilling to cover any of the costs incurred in making such a late hotel booking. They were also quite rude and failed to appreciate the amount of time they had cost us between waiting for them + finding new accommodation, particularly given the limited time we had in Venice. I recommend not staying here, especially in winter, as the property is clearly not a priority for the owners.

In all my years of travel I have never come across Hotel Reception staff with such bad attitude. At the time of booking, I specifically asked for a room on an upper floor away from the kitchen, preferably with a balcony (as per the advice from a previous Trip Advisor review). We were staying for a 5 nights. The room we were allocated was on the ground floor and very near the kitchen. When I queried this on arrival I was told by Thomas, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153it was a request only and they could not comply with my request\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c this line was repeated several times to me. He said there were no other rooms available, so basically it was just too bad\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and with a shrug of his shoulders he said it \u00e2\u20ac\u0153was not possible to change\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and this was the best he could do. (Villa Edera had several weeks to advise me, between making the reservation and our arrival, that they didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a suitable room). I did not feel comfortable with our allocated room at all. Safety being just one of the reasons due to the fact it had a handkerchief size patio on street side. We started to unpack - but then decided we would take a walk around the area to see if we could find an alternative Hotel. Within 15 minutes we found one. Hotel Le Boulevard. Cheaper, and with a bedroom twice the size, a rather large bathroom and with a water view\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 it was perfect, and the owners absolutely delightful. On returning to the Villa Edera 30 minutes later I told Thomas we would stay the first night but would vacate the following morning as we had found another Hotel that was only too happy to accommodate us. Thomas said that if we cancelled our booking he would take the FULL accommodation cost for the remaining 4 days off my Credit Card, so checking out was not an option. This guy is despicable. The interesting thing here is that all of a sudden he had two, yes two! alternative rooms to show us on the upper floor with balconies. Funny that! We changed rooms\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 would much preferred to have changed Hotels though. The other two Reception staff members had a similar demeanour to Thomas\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 guess it rubs off. Simonetta, is the Breakfast waitress, she is nicest thing about Villa Edera. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s interesting to note that during our 5night stay, there were two other sets of Guests that weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t exactly happy with things at this Hotel either.
