After that, we were informed that our toilet was up another flight of stairs. We decided to forgo the shower, as it did not appear too clean. We were thankful for the fan that was in the room, we assume that was because all the heaters in the building were cranked on high. There were no amenities to speak of and we missed breakfast to make our train, but truthfully we were a little frightened of what it might be like. There was a sign saying you needed to wait for personnel to check you out of your room. After waiting 15 minutes, we found all we had to do was hand him the key.

I had to request twice to the receptionist to ''labelize'' at the door of the toilet ''for the sole use of room Nr...'' and he did , BUT the toilet had no locker and was used from other persons too..As for the warm water this was coming out from an on-wall electric heater ..not feeling so safe.. Appart from this of course there was not any radio and TV on the room ,fortunatelly because there was not any noise insulation.. Also, as heating means there were just a tiny electric radiator and a wall heater, I was lucky the weather was very good... Room cleaneless.:HA ,HA ,HA... Hotel needs a top to bottom renewal.. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was coffe,tea,toasts, butter, marmelade and eggs.Milk and corn flakes were provided too.

If you are planning to go to London book a good comfortable hotel few week before. It started when we arrived to the hotel. Inside there is no sign of a reception. There is a small table with a guy who hardly speaks English doing a lot of paper work. When booking the hotel we paid the total up front with Credit Card and received a confirmation by email. Upon arrival the guy at the \"Reception\" mentioned that we only paid the booking costs and not the costs for staying in the hotel. I showed the guy the confirmation sent by email (luckily I printed it !). He admitted and apologized. Then to our room which was supposed to have a PRIVATE shower. We noticed that there is no shower in the room. When I asked the guy he said that he will show me where the shower is. I assumed that the shower was next door but it was not! We had to go downstairs, passed the \"reception\" and everyone who you could possibly encounter in the stairs to take a shower. In the way to the shower there was an awful smell. The stairs where very old and the showers even worse. The showers are not private at all !! Everyone uses the same showers. DO NOT BE TRICKED WHEN YOU RECEIVE AN EMAIL STATING THAT YOU WILL HAVE A PRIVATE SHOWER!. In the first email confirmation the manager stated that we would have a \"Private shower\". When we paid we received another email stating that we will have \" A shower close to the room for sole use\" and when we arrived nothing of this was true. The showers are not private...everyone takes shower in the same cabins. When you complain to the reception guy he will mention that he will talk about that with the \"management department \" and that he is helpless at the moment. We entered the room, very disappointed because that was not what I paid for. The room was too small for two persons. We could hardly walk to passed the beds to the washing basin. I sat on the bed and grabbed my laptop. There was this awful smell coming form underneath the bed. I shut my laptop down and went to the reception. I said that I want my money back and that I am not staying in that hotel any longer. I grabbed my stuff and when to another hotel. Somewhat expensive but more comfortable. I could have a shower in my room. Had clean, fresh and cleaned room, clean bed, clean towels and a healthy varied breakfast. I talked to few people I encountered in the hotel.

They advertise a nice breakfast- and breakfast is only served from 7.30-8.45 am (hince the lovly bakery across from the Tube Station) When I first inquired about the room, the hotel asked if I would email my credit card details to pay for the room in full, I felt very uncomfortable about this so I sent a bank draft instead, which they didn't seem to like, but it worked. Their staff were very bad about responding to emails & the beds were very uncomfortable! Also, there were a lot of stairs, would not reccomend if you're elderly or have bad knees.

The first inconvenience began when we were informed that we couldn't pay with a credit card despite their website saying that they accepted nearly all credit cards. When I entered my parents' double room, we immediately noticed the smell. It took us about a day to figure out what it was--the bathroom was so small that the shower curtain was dangerously close to the toilet. The en-suite bathrooms were what we termed \"pods\"--plastic extensions that were on the whole about the size of a normal shower. My parents eventually asked to have the shower curtain changed and the smell went away. We also had no towels in our room initially and had to ask in order to get some. I then found myself needing to use my parents' shower as mine had no hot water. I was also hesitant to walk around without my shoes on--the carpet seemed very oily and dirty. It was also frustrating that there were very few outlets in either room. I had to unplug our radiator in order to have access to one. The breakfast was sparse--hard-boiled eggs, toast, and cereal--but unlimited and served with lots of tea and coffee. There were also a few staff who were very cheerful, particularly the Christmas Day attendant. There were a few other bright spots in our stay.

The rooms were cleaned almost every day and the beds made - something I did not expect in a low budget place! Except for a faint noise from the nearby tubestation( 5min. walk - great!) it is a very quiet place (no noisy parties at night!), and we woke up to birds singing in the garden every morning!

It was really great to be able to use the kitchen as eating out is so expensiv and the kitchen is well equipped and clean with fridges that can be used by the quests. We also enjoyed the garden for a quiet rest in the sun between sightseeing. The staff at the reception was very friendly and helpfull.

It is definately a no frills budget accommodation and I don't believe that the owners are misleading on this point it is made clear on their website and in the email I received from them. In saying this I don't think I could bring myself to stay there again. We were checked into one room and told (on check in) that the next night we would have to move to another room due to maintenance works. I'm not sure the maintenance works story was quite true as we believe they just needed our first room for a bigger family - in saying this the staff did carry our luggage up to our new room while we were out for the day. Unfortunately the new room came with a broken shower. I will try to be factual and list the good and bad points below. GOOD POINTS Location is excellent - close to Earls Court Underground Station Best Chinese Restaurant within a few minutes walk on Earls Court Road (I think it was called Dragon Palace) Supermarkets, Pubs, Laundromats everything you could ask for close by. Cheap accommodation (for London) Room made up each day ie. beds re-made and general tidy up. Bed Sheets and Towels clean (which obviously is what is expected but I just wanted to add as a reassurance) Reception staff quite accommodating in all our request. We were able to leave our luggage with reception after check out BAD POINTS Showers/Toilets require a good deal of maintenance - my shower had broken off the wall and had leaks therefore our water pressure was rubbish. Toilet seat kept falling off. My sister-in-laws toilet/shower smelt like urine Some rooms are quite cramped - can feel like sleeping in a dungeon Beware if you have noisy upstairs people - I was kept awake to 3am in the morning due to a squeaky floorboard above which everyone seemed to walk over every 2 minutes. Use of kitchen facilities - this should have been a good point and something that I thought I would make use of but the first night I arrived the oven was filthy and had leftover food scraps. This wasn't cleaned out for two days - definately put me off using kitchen facilities. Overall the stay we had there wasn't bad but I would probably pay a little bit more next time in the hope of getting somewhere a little better maintained and presented. I felt comfortable going to bed, as I said before the bedsheets were clean and you didn't feel like you were getting into a dirty bed. The beds are nearly due for replacement. Just the overall feel of the place made me cringe a little and I don't believe that I am particulary fussy.

Despite a 50% credit card deposit made weeks earlier, employee/receptionist demanded we pay the remainder due in cash before giving us the room keys.

The sheets looked OK but one woman had stains on her pillowcase that smelled of hair oil &/or body odor. Dark colored towels were large but didn't smell clean (one had white paint stains). Worn dirty carpet. Wall by a bed had what looked like blood spatter! Hardly room for 1 person to pass between beds & no place for 3 medium-sized suitcases.

I would go back. My wife, maybe not. This B&B is just what it says it is contrary to those who post that it has deceptive claims. It is an old place in fair condition kept relatively clean which provides BASIC needs very economically. The hotel is in a great location for public transportation and even walking to many London attractions. It is surrounded by plenty of eateries of all kinds and 4 major supermarkets have locations within a block. Breakfast is a boiled egg and toast, Cornflakes and milk. Plenty of excellent tea and passible instant coffee. We always augmented ours with english chedder, fresh fruit and yogurt which we bought at Herrods just 10 minutes away on the C1 bus to knightsbridge. We kept our things in one of the two fridges without any problems. Breakfast can be tricky because there are many more beds in the hotel than seats in the dining area. If everyone shows up at once it is an interesting process which seemed to stress out some. This was one of my favorite aspects though to be seated with a group of strangers every other day or so and make aquaintance. Many different countries were represented. We only used the kitchen for sandwiches, but we saw others which cooked full meals. Small and with again just the bare essencials. There are no phones or TV in the rooms. Accept it. There is a TV in the breakfast room. You will lug your own bags up very steep stairs without assistance. There are just 2 ground floor rooms and even they are up stairs from the street level. The bathroom/shower combo is the size of a training module for the mile high club. I suggest that you take full advantage of that. On the other hand, it was kept clean and I, 300+ lbs had no trouble getting clean in it. I actually found its size quite reassuring after we visited the \"Golden Palace\" chinese restruant on Earls Court Rd which was recommended by other reviewers. This is because the Cockroaches we saw in that establishment would not fit in our cozy commode. I recommend you steer clear of that place there were several all bigger than a fat thumb. The water was always hot. The heater worked and we were able to keep the room comfortable very easily. There were clean sheets and towels when we checked in. The towels were only changed when we asked but it was never a problem to get clean ones. We messed the room up every night and each day they vacumed and straightened it just like a real hotel except without the pillow mint. The mattresses should be replaced. They were clean but not firm and were well past thier prime. This is why my wife will likely make me choose another place next time. This was my 4th trip to London in the last 5 years. I have always paid more. There is only one of those places I would prefer. It was over twice the price and did not provide breakfast.

As a single woman, and being out of college, I do not enjoy hostels. I was looking for something safe, yet comfortable and reasonably priced. I very much enjoyed my stay there; the staff were very friendly and obliging, arranging a taxi for me when I left and always happy to answer any questions. It is a no-frills establishment, in a reverted townhouse, so those looking for four star amenities will not find them here, as the house is not wired for room phones, internet, or television. However, you will find a pleasant atmosphere, a lovely breakfast in the common kitchen (a huge plus for those traveling on a budget or who simply like to prepare their own food instead of always eating out), daily maid service, and a small entryway with CCTV cameras, someone at the desk, and a large metal security door that closes at night and to which only hotel guests have keys. For me, the location is ideal; right round the corner from the Earl's Court tube station, and across the street from a great pub and one of the best Chinese restaurants I've ever been to, not to mention the Marks & Spencer Food shop. Granted, the Earl's Court Concert Pavilion is nearby, and it can get loud and noisy on the street from time to time. Those who have difficulty walking should note that most rooms are up a staircase and there is no elevator. For me, that is part of the charm. During my stay, I had two friends come to spend their vacation; Windsor House gave them a room right next to mine. Although there is no internet in the hotel, the McDonalds around the corner is also an EasyInternet Cafe, and is open til early in the morning. The neighborhood once you turn right out of the door is very pleasant, and a good place to go jogging. When I returned to London in September of 2006, I was with my younger brother, who had never been to London. We stayed in a lovely room with a window. We had requested to have a shower and toilet in the room (some have them down the hall, never a problem for those who have lived in dorms or stayed in old buildings, but my brother was 18 and legally able to drink-my mother thought an in-room toilet might be a good thing!) and the staff placed a small portable television set in for us. We had a fabulous time! And when my parents stopped over for a quick weekend on their way to Italy they were able to book a room at Windsor House with us as well. I am now preparing to return to London with my boyfriend, and of course will be returning to Windsor House. One of the neatest things, I find, is the common breakfast. Served family style in the kitchen, you can meet all kinds of interesting people from all over the world who are staying there, and have delightful conversation and make new friends.

It was fairly clean, the beds were fine, there were two pillows on every bed, which was a blessing, as sometimes it can prove impossible to get a 2nd pillow ! I had booked an ensuite room, and had received confirmation that I would have a 'new' shower in our room, and that is exactly what we got, a plastic square box containing a shower in the middle of the room, it was like it was dropped in there from Mars or some other planet.

I raised this with the girl at the downstairs desk, there was nothing she could do, the hotel was full, so we didn't have a loo in the room, which was a bit inconvenient as the next available toilet was up a flight of stairs, and with three kids this can prove a bit troublesome, plus we tried various bathrooms in the hotel on different floors whilst we were there, and none of them contained soap or towels or even paper towels to dry your hands ? which I found strange. The breakfast was ok, we arrived down the first morning at exactly 8.50 a.m. all excited and ready for our day, to be told \"sorry breakfast finishes at 8.45 a.m.\" and there was no arguing there, they were adamant, so we ended up going down the road and getting the breakfast in a cafe, which was fine. The following morning we were down at 8.30 a.m. and had to queue outside in the hall, we were lucky to get a table at almost 8.50 a.m. (same time as previous morning !) and were allowed breakfast that morning, which was adequate, consisted of cornflakes, a boiled egg and toast, tea or coffee, its a no frills establishment, but in fairness for the money, its good value, it cost us approx \u00c2\u00a385 per night for the room, this was a special offer apparently, which for a family of 5 was good value, and the location was brilliant.

Then again, not too high, as overnight travel made both of us sleepy and just desiring some simple R&R. Upon seeing the green canopy, we were excited to enter. Upon arrival, we were tepidly greeted by the \"hostess\" and were told our room would not be ready until 1.5hrs later, but that our bags would be brought up and that we could go get some brunch and come back. We came back 2 hrs later and the bags hadn't budged. Key-in-hand, we ascended the Tower of Babel, wandering aimlessly, getting lightheaded, and trying to figure out the hieroglyphic numbering system in order to find our room. An oriental gentleman told us, once on the 3rd or 4th floor, that we needed to keep going. After spiraling all the way up, we arrived at what their confirmation e-mail called a \" very nice double room, ensuite, and non-smoking.\" When we entered, I felt like I was in Alcatraz. The awkwardly-flanelled bedding, the wireframe prison (or mental institution) beds were delightfully accompanied with a lovely view of a disgusting alley that was a garden a few centuries ago. Our double room had two beds in it (one double and one single), just in case we were smuggling in some refugees. It ended up being a great space for our luggage. And we were able to glean some of the bedding from it to keep ourselves from freezing in the middle of the night. The original fare comes with only a sheet and a flannel \"throw\" blanket. When we looked ahead, we saw what we thought was our coat closet. Upon opening, we found a toilet and a shower is a space smaller than an airport bathroom stall. I didn't think it was possible, but they made it possible! The upside is that every shower is guaranteed to clean the bathroom! I mustn't forget the 1960s-era neon lighting. If you flicker it quick enough, you could start a night club up here. Oh, and the best part is the \"special flush.\" Don't go to the WC in the middle of the night, for if you do and flush it, it will not let you forget it. The sound from the Tube down the street is quieter than this odd-sounding flush. It sounds like a freight train is running through the pipes which are --- of course --- exposed!!! To be fair, there have been no bugs, rats, animals, dust, or refugees in sight.

Thus, for the balance amount i had paid for, i was only entitled to a basic room. This was despite a confirmation email from the hotel that I had booked an ensuite room. In any case, logic would dictate that booking fee cannot amount to 10pounds! In fact, the booking form clearly showed a breakdown of the deposit paid (of which 10pounds was for the hotel deposit and 3.50pounds was for the booking fee). The rude hotel staff kept insisting that I was wrong and was making things difficult for her! Also 'advised' that if i was not happy, i was free to go to another hotel. I was extremely tempted to do so but did not want to risk the chance that I would not get my refund.

I have requested a partial refund but so far nothing.", "Date": "August 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Evanston, IL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, Clean Rooms and Nice Service\u201d", "Author": "kgarza85", "ReviewID": "UR5436877", "Content": "We stayed three nights at the Windsor House, the first night arriving very late - about midnight. They were very kind to us from the time we requested the reservation to the time we checked out. They are what they claim, a budget accommodation. There was no AC, nor did we need it with the doors open - the beds were comfortable, and the linens were clean. The bathroom we had was TINY - but it served its purpose well! The only complaint we had was that our door was across from the floor entrance door. Everytime anyone came in the air pressure would make our door slam as well. It wasn't a problem except when the couple of drunk girls came in and swore our door was theirs! The staff was terrific and calmly explained that their door was down the hall . . . Would stay again - very convenient to Earl's Court underground.", "Date": "July 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney Australia", "Title": "\u201cJust as the website says\u201d", "Author": "mum-and-I", "ReviewID": "UR5368860", "Content": "My Mum and I have just returned from our 2 week stay at Windsor House Hotel. We found the hotel to be just as described on the site. Budget and clean. Yes, the showers are tiny but there is plenty of hot water, just what we needed after our days out and about in London. The breakfast was adequate and sustained us well into the afternoon.Being able to use the kitchen was an added bonus, saving money and hassle at the end of our busy days. M&S Simply Foods is on the corner between the tube and the hotel and is the perfect place to buy ready-to-heat meals to take back to the hotel kitchen.The tube is literally 2 mins walk from the hotel, as is the post office and ATMs. We were nervous about booking on the internet, but found no problems.Our emails ,prior to our arrival, were answered promptly. We had to postpone our trip for 12months after we had sent the deposit, and when we emailed and requested that our deposit be transferred to our new dates, this was done without hesitation. We only had one concern and that was that while we were out of the hotel on our first night, despite locking our luggage, it had been tampered with. Not opened but someone had tried. We reported this to the hotel and thereafter found there to be no further problems, even when we left our luggage in the room while we overnighted in Paris. We of course locked everything up every time we left the room. All-in-all we found the hotel to be great value and in a great location. It met our needs and expectations.", "Date": "June 20, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Windsor House Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d262414-Reviews-Windsor_House_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$79 - $146*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">12 Penywern Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Earl's Court</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "262414", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/39/11/3911a1605f59e3897b608b1c9102c28a1large.jpg"}}
