Montreal is a french speaking region however all the staff at the hotel spoke English. The hotel is very chic and modern and most importantly clean!! The staff was very friendly, we managed to purchase tickets to the Rogers Tennis Tournament through the concierge, who managed the booking for us. Breakfast was simple but adequate, bagels, cheese, ham, pancakes, cereal and fruit. Along with fruit juices, tea and coffee. Breakfast is served until 10:30am which makes a nice change so you can have a lay in if need be and still have breakfast. The rooms are amazing, very modern. The toiletries are all Molton Brown and the walk in shower is heaven!! There are no tea/coffee facilities in the room but there is a mini bar but it is expensive, I believe $5 for a small bottle of water. There is a docking station along with a radio which is set to the Jazz radio station which plays wonderful music. There is a safe in the room along with a hairdryer, ironing facilities and a TV. Due to being in Montreal on business I cannot comment on the local attractions but if I were to visit Montreal on holiday I would certainly stay here. Taxi's are called for you by the hotel staff and arrive minutes later. There is a gym however I cannot comment on that as I did not use/see it. There is also a restaurant in the hotel but again I cannot comment, I would suspect that it is expensive however probably worth the money. However for the sake of a 20 minute walk to downtown there are plenty of restaurants ranging from French to Italian.

OK, maybe that was because there was a wicked lightening storm outside at the time and I had visions of being stuck in that tiny cubicle for hours.

An unfortunate view from the back of the hotel looking directly into an adjoining office building (I could literally see the photo on someone's desk!) and dumpsters. However, it's wall to wall windows and the sheers do a fine job of blocking out the lousy view.

He enquired where we wanted to go and suggested the Hotel's courtesy vehicle was out on an errand and might be back in time to give us a complimentary drive. In the event this wasn't possible he would have a taxi standing by in 20 minutes. We met our friends in the lobby 15 minutes later and to our surprise the staff gave us a lift to Au Pied de Cochon. Our Chauffer was interesting to talk to and suggested the meal would be something to remember. Montreal it could be said has no shortage of things to celebrate or ways to celebrate them but a meal like this followed by Celine live in concert made for a memorable evening.

Loved the bathroom concept with the blinds and open shower concept, very shick... So in reference to an earlier review I read, if you want wallpaper and old school wooden doors in your hotel, i suggest MOtel 8 those consumers. The gym was in construction, but they do have an offer to use a gym near by if wanted.

If you know much about dust and dark wood, it's not that the room is not cleaned, but rather that EVERYTHING shows no matter how good the cleaning staff is. SO just a heads up if you do notice that.

Overall, let me explain, my rating is low due to some problems, but there were some nice highlights as well. Our room was a \"Gourmet\" package including a deluxe King Size room with bathtub and 7 course meal. We seriously regret the gourmet package, which was a total disaster. Ok, first room they provided us with was a mistake, we were supposed to get a bathtub and reserved one long long in advance, instead we walk in and got a shower. the shower was silly, no door and in the winter, it was cold. Mind you, this hotel is known for their bathrooms and having a bathtub for our anniversary was a must. They had no other bathtubs available until the next day. The room was a bit dirty as in stuff splashed on the walls and the glass wall separating the bathroom from main room was covered in dust, everything else was pretty clean such as floor and shower, sheets were nice but terribly stiff so rough on the skin, lots of water on the windows (condensation) with water pooling in the window sills and dripping down the window making the room VERY humid and muggy. Very modern trendy decor, very large room. When they moved us to the other room, it was to our surprise the bi-level apartment suite. Very nice room, but again cleanliness needed improvement. Parts of the floor were dirty, stuff sprayed on walls in bathrooms which kind of grossed me out. However, we did appreciate the massive upgrade in the room and fantastic service. The staff there is excellent. The bathroom had an amazing set up, unfortunately we couldn't figure out how to drain the water in the tub and were only able to take a single bath. The restaurant. Oh boy. That place is a train wreck. First day breakfast (we dined in the restaurant) food was cold, tables were dirty with food all over, staff was rude. We had purchased a gourmet package with a 7 course meal in the evening which was a high light of our trip,, but we were not told it was a forced menu with raw seafood. After some huffle, they finally agreed to substitute the seafood for something else as I am allergic, but only for me not my husband. The seating was this very tiny table shoved in a very busy walkway near the stairs. Everything was eccentric, smelly and raw. Raw Emu, raw wild fish eggs, thymus glands, sea cucumbers, raw fish, and some sort of larvae where things wiggled when I brushed my fork over it. Interesting food is fine, we like our steak rare and enjoy calamari, but this was bird bites and just strange, what was worse is we had no choice in being served this stuff, it was forced on us and it was what we got regardless if we liked it or not. Staff that evening was OK. This cost us an additional $200, and it wasn't worth 5 bucks. We were so upset after that we went back to our room and went to bed. Food next day (breakfast) we had brought to our room. It was very cold, egg was raw and very runny, we were provided with a single packet of nutra sweet to split between both of our coffees, and it tasted gross. If you want to stay at the hotel, I would suggest avoiding the food like the plague.

I went down for a post dinner tea and there was nothing set up, and, the capuccino maker was broken at the time (granted, hotel staff were advised of this and tried to fix the problem immediately and someone came out from a back kitchen with a carafe of very hot water) -breakfast time was busy and food ran out fast, which is understandable, but it seemed to take forever for the staff to get it together and re-stock.

First, the pros: nice modern decor - minimalistic without feeling cold. The rooms, while small, were pretty well appointed, and the bathrooms were nice too. Some might think the see-through shower is gimmicky, but we thought it was cool. And the location was good - in downtown, just a few blocks away from the nicest area of town with good shopping and restaurants. While everything was OK, I can't say it was great. I don't have any service horror stories, but it was overall underwhelming. Here are a few examples: - We emailed the concierge in advance for specific restaurant recommendations. They emailed me back with a standard list (which is on their web site) instead of having anything specific - At breakfast (which was free with the room), someone came over to me and said \"Some people are asking about what your room number is\". I don't know if this was a language issue, but it sounded as if they thought I walked in off the street. - The maid's cart sat in the hallway outside our room for most of a day. Can't they get their work done - They only provide 2 towels, so when we were leaving to go out for dinner, we requested that they turn the room and replenish the mini-bar. Despite our request, they did neither. - The workout room is pretty pathetic...we paid 20 bucks to use the MAA sports club a few blocks away - After the 1st day, they never replenished those green apples that they make such a big deal about in the hallway on our floor. One other note - I didn't like the city of Montreal at all. Very seedy and industrial looking, blocks either felt touristy or desolate. Many people had told me it has a \"European\" feel - I am guessing these people had never been to Europe and are just impressed by French accents. You're better off spending a weekend in Boston or Philly. If you have to go to Montreal, though, I would suggest staying at the Loews Vogue if you want something more modern, or the Ritz Carlton if you want something more elegant and classic.
