{"Reviews": [{"Content": "The Hotel Flora is great! I stayed at the Hotel Flora based on the earlier review. I agree with the writer about everything. The Hotel Flora is a family run hotel with some of the best service I have had anywhere. The staff are friendly and always happy to do what they can to help.  I was in Prato for four days and got a cold/flu from the plane travelling there. The Flora staff were as helpful as can be imagined, offering to get me food, go to a chemist for me and, indeed, prepared to do anything that would help me in my stay. Oh, and they all speak English with considerable proficiency.  I was in Prato for a conference at the Monash University Centre there. The Hotel Flora is very conveniently located, not only for the centre of old Prato, near the cathedral, but less than five minutes walk from the Monash Centre.  I can strongly recommend the hotel", "Date": "May 28, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR600902115", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PerthTraveller63"}, {"Content": "loved it - really friendly The Flora doesn't look much and our first reaction on seeing our room was a bit flat... but... despite being a bit shabby around the edges the place is just great... comfiest bed in Italy, awesome hot showers! The location is also fabulous, Prato's old city is wonderful and such a pleasant change from the chaos of nearby Florence. And the Flora is perfectly positioned. But what makes the Flora great is the service... everyone is so friendly, ready to help and really, just absolutely lovely. I would stay there again without hesitation. We were there for eight days and were sad to leave... it was like leaving family!", "Date": "Jan 30, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR191274607", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "hbbnz"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d253833-r7710313-Flora_Hotel-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "253833", "Price": "$112"}}
