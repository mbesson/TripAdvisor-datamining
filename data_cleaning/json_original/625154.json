This is a great hotel especially if you are coming to see a baseball game, all you do is walk across the street and into the ballpark. We could also see the Ravens stadium too from our window. I suggest that you pay to have your car keeps in the valet parking. These guys also did a great job with moving all the cars around.

We went to the front desk to ask where the pool was as my kids are standing next to me in their bathing suits, they told us on the bottom floor and never mentioned the pool hours until we saw the sign on the pool door. You think he would of told us that before sending us down there.

We were in town on business for a trade show, but I'm guessing that if you're looking for a place to stay to attend a game at either of the stadiums, this is a very convenient spot. I can't, however, account for the noise level on a game day, as described in the other reviews. This modern hotel is also just a few blocks from the Convention Center and a reasonable walk to the Inner Harbor area, which is populated with shops, restaurants, and the impressive national aquarium. If you don't want to walk to the Inner Harbor, take the free Orange Line bus that stops in front of the Hilton Hotel, which is around the corner. We had a corner room, which had ample space. The gym is located in the basement and is well equipped with cardio equipment as welll as free weights and some weight machines. The free breakfast and free wi-fi are standard features of a Hampton Inn that make it such good value. Shower head was good but water pressure was average. The staff was friendly and the hotel was clean. We used the business center to check into our flights and print our boarding passes. The only disappointment was a lack of electrical plugs in the room to charge cell phones and laptops. The restaurants adjacent to the hotels are disappointing. They are seedy sports bars that play music so loud that you can't possibly conduct a conversation. I also question their level of hygiene. Just peeking into them was sufficient to convince us to go to the Inner Harbor for a broad selection of restaurants. I recommend eating at the Inner Harbor one night and The Circle area another.

The location of this hotel is perfect if you are there for a visit to Camden Yards. In terms of visiting the Inner Harbor, it is only perfect if you plan to do a lot of walking to get there as it is located about 7 blocks (nearly a mile) from the Inner Harbor. I knew this in advance and we didn't mind the walk even though it was a bit chilly when we were there. There is the Charm City Circulator which is a free bus that picks up around the corner and will take you around Baltimore. We took it back one night and it was good since it was cold but I was a little uncomfortable in some of the areas we picked up in. Otherwise, if you don't want the walk, plan to pay for a taxi. The breakfast was fine, average and what you can expect by most Hampton Inn standards. Not quite as much variety as I have seen at other Hampton Inns and no gluten-free cereal option at breakfast which was a disappointment to my daughter. There was popcorn in the lobby in the afternoon and evening which was nice. Bottled water is cheaper out of the vending machine on the floor by your room vs the store in the lobby. There is a small indoor pool which was pretty much empty while we were there. The room we had was lovely. It was large and very clean. We was well appointed and comfortable. Our view was not so great as we overlooked a power station, but in a city sometimes you get what you get. It was better than our first room which we requested to be moved from since it was on a lower level with a view of the alley behind Pickles Pub next door. We had requested to be moved to a room in the front with a view of Camden Yards; however, they were not available as we were there the weekend of the unveiling of the Brooks Robinson statute (which is located directly in front of the hotel). In terms of restaurants, there were a few but depending on what you like there was not a tremendous variety in the immediate block; you are better off going near the Inner Harbor for a great restaurant selection. The staff was not overly helpful in this area, I asked a couple of different people for suggestions and they did not make a recommendation. When I asked about a specific restaurant I was told \"sure, that would be a good option\".

I couldn't believe how great the atmosphere was... hundreds of people just milling about hours before gametime, dozens of vendors grilling up food... the perfect environment to get pumped up for baseball (and none of the noise from below could be heard from my seventh-story room). If you like to party after the game, however, this might not be the hotel for you, as they make you sign a no-partying clause. Which is fine with me because I prefer to sleep. The room was monstrous. In fact, the beds were so far away from the TV that I could hardly see it. A 50-inch TV would be more appropriate for this space than the little flatscreen provided. The room had a small lobby with a sink, microwave and fridge, a huge sitting area with couch, two queen beds, a large closet, and a sink with a granite countertop outside the bathroom. Everything was clean and neat. The hotel has a pool and hot tub, both ridiculously small for a hotel of this size. No matter. There's also a small, private, quiet computer room in the lobby, free to use for 15 minutes at a time (or longer if no one's waiting). Breakfast is free, and it's good: Sausage, eggs and hash browns one morning; omelets and ham the next morning; and waffles, cereal, fruit, donuts, muffins and drinks every day. The employees were friendly and helpful without exception, and every one we saw said hello and asked how things were. Special consideration to the valet guy, Laban, who was extra-kind to us and even remembered what kind of car I drove. Kudos to him for dealing with the crazy parking situation here; it looks like they've got 40 cars crammed into an alley.

Ladies you know how hard it is to keep snow white white. In this hotel they had snow white coverlets on all the quilts, and they were snow white. There wasn't a spot on any of them. The rest of the hotel was just as clean. Every morning we had a hot breakfast that was served from 6:00 am to 10:00 am. These breakfasts consisted of eggs and either a sausage, ham, canadian bacon or bacon and some kind of home fries. There was also the choice of fresh fruits, dry cereal, donuts, muffins, bagels, coffees, teas, juices, and milks. Some of our students had birthdays, so I brought cupcakes and frosting to celebrate. We did not eat all of them, so the put the frosting in the hotel refrigerator so we could use it the next day. Two days before we arrived it occured to me that we had some students that were allergic to feathers. This hotel had feather pillows and quilts. I caled and requested that 5 of the rooms not have feathers. They were not sure who would get what room, so they took them out of all the rooms, and anyone who wanted feathers could just ask and they could get them. We spent most of our time at the convention center and Inner Harbor, which is about 2 blocks from the convention center. We went to the Aquarium and several restaurants, and a few of the mall shops.

(Hot items ranged from home fries, omelettes, porked ham, bacon, and bagel toppers during our stay.) There is also juice and coffee.

It had a fridge, microwave, desk, and a pullout couch (but don't count on the couch for a very good sleep. The person who slept on it said it was not comfortable at all.) The beds were comfy, and the bathroom and the vanity area were clean. The pool is small, but it's nice. There is also a jacuzzi. In addition, there is a lifeguard on duty at all times. There is also a fitness area and a laundry area. I also used the business center, but if your counting on the computer to send business reports or something along those lines, I would be careful. The computer was sort of slow and very inconsistent. The walk to Camden Yards is literally 30 seconds across the street. Right next to the hotel is Pickles Pub.

Orioles.com has more info on the ballpark tour. We visited the inner harbor area for the afternoon. It's very nice. We went to the Maryland Science Center. While nice, it's definitely geared towards younger children. (Tip: The lifeguard gave us very good words of wisdom. When you step out the hotel main lobby door, go the left, NOT to the right. The neighborhood to the right of the hotel is not so good. To the left, (towards Pickles Pub, etc.) is nice.) There is a $26 a night valet. There is basically nowhere to park in Baltimore. Keep in mind that your vehicle will likely be parked offsite a few blocks away. Remember to take your belongings, but if you forgot something the hotel will send someone to go get your stuff. Also, you need to call the lobby 15 minutes prior to getting your vehicle, so keep that in mind when planning your day.

One warning about the crowd we encountered at the game (and can be said for just about every ballpark I've been to except Fenway Park): there will be loud, oboxious, unlearned Oriole fans there.

We got to Baltimore early (11:00am) and the hotel let us check right in. Our room was very spacious, clean, recently updated and comfortable. We didn't make a dinner reservation but Dorian, the friendliest and hardest working front desk man, was happy to make some suggestions and show us menus. We ended up going to Obrycki's for crabs. Having eaten crabs from the time I was 4, I wasn't very impressed, if I were you, try somewhere else. When we returned from dinner Dorian was there to greet us with a smile and asked how dinner was. In the morning we took advantage of the free breakfast which was adequate with coffee, juice, muffins, bagels, eggs, yogurt, cereal and fruit. It wasn't the best breakfast ever (we're breakfast snobs), but if you have children and don't feel like spending more money, this is perfect. Check out was a breeze as Dorian was still there! When does this guy sleep? I read some reviews where the valet was slow but they brought our car around in under 5 minutes. From the hotel we went over to Fells Point for some shopping and afternoon bar hopping. We are planning a return trip to Baltimore and will most definately stay at the Hampton Inn! We usually stay in 4 star hotels but we find absolutely no reason to spend the extra money when the Hampton Inn is such a nice hotel and such a great value for the money!", "Date": "September 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pennington, NJ", "Title": "\u201cLocation, location, location, but book early for key weekends\u201d", "Author": "marybcole", "ReviewID": "UR19625994", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel as part of our 10-day Baseball Road Trip. The location of this hotel is perfect if you are in town for a game \u2013 it\u2019s a one minute walk to the stadium. Rooms were very nice and a so-so breakfast is included \u2013 adequate, but nothing special. When we made our reservation, the 2-queen-bed rooms were sold out, so we got a king w/ rollaway bed. The rollaway was a bit short for my son who is 12, but already 5\u201910\u201d. Our room looked out on an alley way and brick buildings, but I think the other rooms look out toward the stadium. View and access to sunlight would be better there. One word of caution is that there are eateries and bars next to the hotel that party-on after a game (nothing seedy, but potentially noisy), so it could be loud on the stadium side. Ask the hotel or read other reviews on this. The hotel has a small pool, and even though some folks said it had limited hours, we could swim from 9AM to 10PM. It\u2019s a basement pool, so no view to the outside, but it was good for a quick dip once or twice a day. I am sure this is not as swanky as other hotels that are $400+, but those were not in our budget and we hardly spent any time in the room. We very much enjoyed our stay here and would certainly come back. Book early! One last word on finding the hotel. We came down Green St and attempted to turn left on Washington Blvd in front of the hotel. It seemed like Washington Blvd was a one way street, so we kept going and circled all over the place. Called hotel and they encouraged us to just bully our way on to Washington Blvd, even though there were lots of cars and trucks parked there on game day. They were right! We made the turn successfully. You may have to hop out and find the valet since it\u2019s really crowded in front of the hotel. Also, request car well in advance to get it out of valet parking on a game day.

From here it was only a 2 block walk to the hotel using West Camden St. Upon check in we were given a room on the 3rd floor overlooking Camden Yards.

When we arrived at 4pm (game time 7pm that night) we found the lobby mobbed with folks checking in. Waited about 15 minutes which wasn't so bad until the front desk person notified us that the 2 Bed Queen Suite (with micro/fridge) we booked was not available. When I asked why, I was told someone had \"stayed over\" which should not have happened when we had the room reserved and paid for that night. I asked for and spoke with the manager on duty and she tried to help by checking what was available. First she asked of we would accept two single rooms (at the price we paid for the suite) and Isaid that would be fine if they were connecting or even next to each other. She thought she found one and we said great, but then she found that one room was on 5th floor and the other on 3rd and that would not work for us. She went back to looking for a room and finally said, I;m sorry but it appears the ONLY non-smoking room we have is a one bed King room, no sofa bed. She asked if that would work and I said, not really since it was my wife, me and two boys. Now it is 530 and nearly time to get ready for the game so we could not really go find anything else, so I said we would take the room but for all our trouble, how about a reduced rate? She asked what would make me happy? I replied, I would have been hapy with the room we reserved and paid for and could accept the room at a reduced rate but was not \"happy\" about it and would not return again to this hotel. (We usually stay at Courtyard Marriotts or Residence Inns and have NEVER had a problem like this). she still pressed on about what price would make me happy for the room and I said, Well, FREE would make me happy and she said OK you got it. Needless to say I was surprised as well as being \"happy\" with a free room. After all, they did waste about an hour and a half of our time anyway. The rest of the stay was great. Room was very comfortable (except for the boys sleeping on the floor).

My family (me, my wife, and two teen sons) were staying over a long weekend in Baltimore with the Orioles and the Inner Harbor as centerpieces. Overall, I stay was worth it and pleasant. However, we had mixed feelings about the hotel itself. PRO: LOCATION - The location next to Camden Yards makes it perfect for a stay. If that is your goal, stay there. But also know that there are several other hotels there or being built. PRO: CLEANLINESS - The hotel was very clean and well-maintained. PRO: LAUNDRY - There was a free laundry next to the workout gym and pool. For a famiiy in the midst of an extended trip this might be a real plus. CON: HOTEL ACCESS - When we first arrived, there was a game in progress. The street immediately in front of the hotel was blocked off with orange street cones. There was no obvious way to access the hotel. I circled the block three times before I finally ended up in an alley directly behind the hotel. Finally, I called the front desk with my cellphone. I told them what was going on. She instructed me to go back to the front where the cones were and she'd come out and meet me. I went there; she never did. Bottom line - with 81 home dates per year, I find it incomprehensible that this hotel hasn't done a better job of wayfinding for an arriving guest. CON: POOL HOURS - This may sound petty but the posted pool hours are only 5p-10p nightly. There is no explanation for this. And if you desire to walk the Inner Harbor in the evening, a common desire, you basically can't access the pool. Again, for folks going to a 7:00pm baseball game that pretty much means you won't be swimming. The pool itself is relatively small, in the basement, and without windows to the inside. Bottom line - my kids felt gypped that they couldn't swim because our itinerary often had us away during the unusually limited hours. CON: BREAKFAST SERVICE - The posted hours for a very nice complimentary breakfast served in the lobby was 6a-10a. I was traveling with two teen boys who like their sleep. When I arrived at 9:45am to get breakfast.... the cupboard was bare. Other guests told me that the woman in charge of this area had started breaking down the food service at 9:30am. No cereal, no fruit, no donuts.... just a few scraggly bagels.... Then, when we shared this information with the front desk the following day, we were told that we were mistaken and that breakfast had been avaible through 10am.... unbelievable.... we were there but couldn't trust our own eyes, I suppose. Bottom line - if you post breakfast hours, keep those hours fully available. CON: ROOM SECURITY - Now this may seem really petty but it was important to me. I specifically placed a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on my door one morning. I was willing to forgo room service because I was doing some work and had a lot of my stuff out. I wanted to run an errand without securing all of my stuff. (I know... I know... not wise). Nevertheless, I did it. Imagine my surprise when I returned to find the sign ignored and my room done up. Now, I appreciate the maid's desire to \"do her job\" but... I fail to understand why she would have ignored my wishes. FINAL THOUGHT: Again, our vacation time was not \"ruined\" by any of the above and, ultimately, the location was terrific. I would advise others to shop around.

We normally stay at one of the Marriotts but decided to stay at the Hampton this time (over Memorial Day weekend) because of the great reviews. Boy, am I glad we did! Even with the Yankees in town, I saved about 100 a night by staying at the Hampton. We booked a double queen studio suite and it was huge. There was a wet bar in the room with a refrigerator, about a 32\" or 40\" flat screen LCD, two extremely comfortable pillowtop queens and a comfortable sofa bed, and the toilet and shower was separate from the sink (which is very convenient, guys). On arrival, we pulled in front of the hotel and the valet unloaded our bags and took our car. The hotel is right next to some of the Orioles fans hometown bars such as Pickels and they even block off the triangle in front of the bars during game days and food, beverage (alcohol and non), and souvenir vendors set up. The hot sausage and grill smell is incredible. The walk to Camden Yards was right across the street, very convenient, and the walk to Inner Harbor shops and restaurants was about 15 minutes. We even walked back to the hotel from the Inner Harbor at 11:00 on Sunday night and the area was safe. I can't comment on the breakfast because we did not eat at the hotel but it looked busy and smelled good. A few small extras that the hotel affords its guests that puts it over the top as compared to other area hotels is that it held our luggage after checkout at no cost and allowed us to keep our car there for only a $15 extra charge after checkout as we went to the baseball game. Most of the other hotels (or the Marriotts we usually stayed at) charge $35 or higher on game days. Valet parking was $26 per night and that is average or even cheaper than other hotels in Baltimore. Finally, the only thing from me giving this 5 starts was the valet service when we were leaving. I have to believe there was an internal issue on this day because I have not seen the same complaints on other reviews. But when we left the game and wanted to retrieve our car, all of the others who were staying at the hotel were doing the same and we waited over an hour for our car. Normally we would just sit in the lobby and wait but we just sat in the heat for 2 hours and were eager to get home. That, in no way, took away from the cleanliness, hospitality, and comfort the hotel provided us that weekend.

However, the view from the other window was nice--next to the hotel is an old brick building that had a great mural of the Inner Harbor on the wall. The bed was comfortable--no complaints there. The bathroom had a granite countertop. The only problem was that the sink was too high. I'm short and my husband is average height and we both agreed the sink could have been lower.
