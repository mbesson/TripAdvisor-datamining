The Front Desk staff was very helpful and hospitable and let me check into my room a little before check in. I was in a standard room with one double bed. The room was very tiny and was clearly very old. There were a lot of cracks in the wall and on the sidings, and the closet had pipes that ran through it. The television had only a couple of channels that worked, and the room was incredibly loud. (I was near the elevators) The bed however was wonderful! We met up with some members of the club for dinner and had an amazing meal. The dinner was in Cathedral Hall and I think that was the most incredibly beautiful room I have ever been in. The view was breath taking, and the dinner was delicious. The servers were very attentive and did an excellent job.Although the room needed a little extra TLC the building itself is incredible and fun to explore. I would recommend the University Club.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location - Just not used to a dress code\u201d", "Author": "Jeepyg", "ReviewID": "UR120221063", "Content": "I stayed at the University Club during a business trip. The hotel is located adjacent to Millennium Park, and only a few short blocks to the lake. I took a cab to get to the hotel, but there's convenient public transportation to the hotel as well. The service was very good. The room was vintage and elegant - the bathroom had great tilework, The room was a good size, but perhaps on the small size compared to a more modern hotel. The thing that was most interesting was the dress code. I was aware ahead of time of the code, but it was still a shock. I was there for business, so I had the appropriate clothes. However, I just felt as if I was going to get berated for wearing jeans - which I didn't. I had drinks and dinner in the hotel. I stood on an outdoor dining area overlooking the park sipping a Manhattan. I felt so cool! Dinner was at in Cathedral Hall. Wow! What a room - stained glass, high ceilings, ornate fixtures, dark wood and stone. The service was first rate. The dinner was very good. I ate breakfast at the Front Grill. It felt like an old boys club - a lot of men engrossed in business conversations - which i guess describes me too. The food and service were very good. I wouldn't choose to stay here again. It's just not my style. However, I would recommend you stay here at least once for the experience. It is a really nice hotel.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAwesome for business travel\u201d", "Author": "Klwoodsy", "ReviewID": "UR119293563", "Content": "I hosted an event at the University Club of Chicago and it was GREAT! Each year I host the same event in various major cities around the country. This year we were in Chicago. A lot of the major hotels would not give us the time of day because we only needed 15 sleeping rooms. The UCC was well appointed and the service was excellent. I stayed in a room that was overlooking Millenium Park. The bed, the view and the bathroom were all to die for. I had a HUGE room, a super comfortable bed and a bathroom that was like a spa. There was a heated foor, double sinks, flat screen tv and phone in the bathroom. All of that plus double sinks, 2 medicine cabinets for storage, hair dryer, robes, a bath scale, deep soaking tub, steam shower with bench, 8 shower heads including a rainfall shower head. The room was well appointed and featured a large flatscreen tv + a walk in closet. The rules and dress code were pretty strict. My sister came to visit and was asked to sit in a corner of the lobby because she was wearing sneakers. I can't imagine staying here with my kids. It would be too stressful making sure they didn't break any rules. But as a business traveler is was lovely, quiet and nice. As if that weren't enough, they had some of the lowest prices in town!", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, Utah", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "torreynado", "ReviewID": "UR119112993", "Content": "I spent the weekend at the club and found it to be delightful.

Preppy dress code. Had to wear nicer clothes then I am used to, not that I dress like a slob, but I don't have a lot of collared shirts being a woman. We had come in from Midway, via the \"L\". I changed my shoes and put on a collared shirt outside the hotel. Ck. in was fast, and we were on the Monroe side of the hotel on the 3rd floor, very noisy all day, and had trouble sleeping at night. I did enjoy my view of the Chicago Institute of Art. The bed in the rm was a king, and very comfortable. The TV was just so so. The very nice bellman brought in our luggage and showed us around the rm, and got us ice water, he also said they had no movies on cable, but you could rent them from the front desk. You are not supposed to tip here, but we did anyway. We ate dinner and breakfast at the Front Grill, on the the 7th floor. Very good food. Plus, a fabulous view of the lake front. The location of the hotel is very nice, because the next day I walked over to the Chicago Institute of Art and Millennium Park. The University Club was very close to the Adams/Wabash stop, on the Orange Line, to the Loop, on Monroe Street. As you headed to Monroe Street, you could see the green awnings to the right. There was a ironing board and iron, but the plugs were a bit hard to locate and find. The restroom was tub/shower, which was hard to figure out how to turn it on at first, once you did it was ok. If you are prone to hot showers, you will not get them here. I don't like very hot showers, but the water was quite unconfortably cold here. I did love the towels though, and you had the luxury of individual robes hanging in the closet. If you like to dress college prep, stay here. It is nice, but too stuffy for me.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Indianapolis, IN", "Title": "\u201cneeds upkeep\u201d", "Author": "wvscott", "ReviewID": "UR22558915", "Content": "Stayed here for a very beautiful wedding, also held in the Club. The wedding location was beautiful, but the guest rooms need some TLC; the paint was peeling off the ceiling in the bathroom, the toilet wasn't bolted properly to the floor and was extremely wobbly. Good luck taking a shower at prime time -- about an hour before the wedding -- all the guests at our wedding talbe were complaining of cold showers. Mine was barely tepid; they must've encountered this issue before! The elevators are also very slow -- we opted to lug our own bags up three stories after waiting for about 12 min for an elevator. When it was time to go to the wedding, we waited 16 min to go from the 5th floor to the 9th (which wasn't stair accessible -- we tried!) Also, we booked 2 hotel rooms together, to be paid for by the same person. Upon arriving, the other (paying) party had already checked in; we were not allowed to go to our room until we had called the other party to make sure we were \"allowed\" in our room, even though they were all reserved with the same credit card. It was a bit bizarre, since it was all on file, and since the clerk did not request that the person he spoke to on the phone credibly identify themselves.
