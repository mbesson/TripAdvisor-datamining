I know this is half a lifetime ago, but at that time The Mandarin (as it was known then) was one of the top three hotels in this city state. Not anymore. Things change, some even for the better over time, but not this hotel, it has lost at least two stars in my estimation. The once magnificent lobby that opened up onto Orchard Road has been replaced by a six-story shopping mall, with the new entrance around a corner on a side street. I say \u201centrance\u201d because that\u2019s all it is, an entrance. When you walk in you are faced with a bank of elevators, the concierge desk, the bell desk and a passageway through to the new mall. The elevators take you to the new lobby, now strangely located on the 6th floor. The room too had major problems. We had booked (and pre-paid for) a week in a deluxe king-bed room, which is two grades above their basic room, but I swear the room they showed us to was their very basic room. It was very small and dingy, with shower over tub behind a drab curtain, two lights that didn\u2019t work and drab and uninspiring furnishings and d\u00e9cor. I had seen enough! So I had my wife wait for the bags and to instruct the bellman to return them to the lobby as we would not be staying, and I went down to the front desk and politely but firmly told them my tale. Things got better from that moment. Three of the very smart and courteous staff behind the counter got their heads together and seemed to agree that the room we had been shown to was not what we had booked, but as no rooms of that grade was available; would we accept a free upgrade to a suite on an upper floor? They personally took us to look at this suite \u2013 we liked it - and accepted it with thanks. The fact remains though that this hotel now caters to a different market than it once did, and I got no inkling of this when I viewed their web site when I was choosing where to stay. The breakfast buffet that we had chosen as part of the room rate was of moderate standard, and on most days was crowded with large groups from Malaysia, we ate there only three times even though we had paid for seven days. It rains sometimes in Singapore, and the hotel taxi policy directs taxis to those who are going to the airport, (separate lines) so if you want a ride just within the city you get bypassed if the airport line is populated! The hotel is still in a great place on fashionable Orchard Road, and we did enjoy Singapore, but the hotel experience dulled the splendid memories we had of its past glories.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ambleside, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cSo-so Business hotel\u201d", "Author": "moumoulous", "ReviewID": "UR128350558", "Content": "There was no real wow factor in this hotel, just a typical hotel for suits.

We paid around \u00a3220/night for our rooms, yet were expected to pay extra for internet access ($5/hour), which is a rip-off, plain and simple.

Fortunately, we didn't get to experience the bad stories that I've read about this hotel. As the title suggests, this is just an OKAY hotel (sorry if I have to use that word frequently in this review) with a fantastic location in Orchard Road. Rooms - The Premier room have good size with very simple design. It fits two adults nicely but size only becomes a problem when you are expecting guests just like we did. Beds are just okay and pillows are too soft for my liking. Remote control of the TV and then the cable TV had problems, but it was fixed quickly. Bathrooms are clean, spacious and the shower is great! We got the Orchard Wing room, but we don't have the view of Orchard Road. Service - Slightly above average. We waited for 1 hour to get the rooms that we want. Waiting time for room service takes about 15-20 minutes, we asked for a bucket of ice and we were charged $3 SGD for the delivery (boo!). I mentioned earlier that problems with our TV were addressed quickly (good job!). I forgot to put my laptop in the safe but it remained untouched even after room cleaning. Staff are nice and friendly, especially the Filipinos who are my 'kababayans'. Location - Superb especially if you are shopping. Just imagine all the malls along Orchard Road just a few steps away. 2 MRT stations are near the hotel with Somerset being the nearest (about 5-7 mins of walk). Food - Breakfast buffet is just okay, selection was good but the taste was just ordinary. Very few changes in the food selection for the 3 days that we had our breakfast. Overall: There's really nothing spectacular in this hotel. I can't remember anything that really impressed me, I'm not even sure if this deserves a 5-star rating. It was just okay rooms, okay service, okay food, no seats in their small lobby, no free Wi-Fi, and a small pool.

I experienced series of inconveniences upon booking with reservation department when i called up to book 2 rooms for 2 nights stay for my company guests (3 guests). First was on the evening 6th of April. I met the male staff, named John on the phone. He was not professional and knowledgeable about the product knowledge of the hotel at all. When i asked him about the amenities in the room, welcome amenities, assessable facilities for the Deluxe room on corporate - He was just simply saying \" I do know know\". In addition, He made so much of odd sounds during the conversation on the phone like arhh, uhm, 10th April (repeated continuously). This made me felt so annoying. Second was in the morning 8th April. I met the female staff, named Marry Grace on the phone. I requested to call me back my mobile number in Vietnam, but she did not. So I had to call her up after 15 mins of waiting. Marry was better than John, however she still upset me after receiving my confirmation by email. My guest's name was spelled wrongly even i was asked to repeated the guest names so many times. The price of the room per night was one of the worst. I had been told by John was S $754 NET per room 2nights, inclusive of breakfast and 02 hrs internet, for 2 rooms will be S $1508 NET . Then, Marry Grace told me in the next day was $330 Net per room per night, inclusive of breakfast and 24 hrs internet. However, when she sent back the confirmation by email, it was S $ 330++/room/night, and the other room was S$ 360++/room/night inclusive of breakfast and 24hrs internet. As the same as John, When i asked about the amenities, welcome amenities and assessable facilities, Marry was just simply saying \"I do not know\". Today, 8 April, Mr. Lay Gin jumped in and took it over from Marry Grace, send back the confirmation by email. Unfortunately, The name of my guests are still spelled wrongly, even i have stated clearly the family name, the middle name, the given name in the email. How great Madarin Orchard Singapore are ! My guests and i have not stayed there yet, but soon. Unfortunately, your staffs have created this impacts, so how can i ensure my guests have a pleasant stay at your hotel in the 10 April ?

This is my 4th time in Singapore and my 3rd time to stay in a hotel along Orchard Road. We stayed at Grand Central and Four Seasons during the previous two. Location wise, Mandarin Orchard can't be beat because it's right in the center of Orchard unlike the other two which are located at almost the opposite ends of Orchard Road. Check-in We arrived before the 2PM check-in time and were asked to fill out the registration card and come back after 2PM because the room was not yet ready. It was true that there were no chairs in the lobby but I overheard the Front Desk Supervisor tell a guest that guests can sit in the restaurant fronting the check-in counter without any need to order anything. We had a late lunch at the adjoining Mandarin Gallery (convenient) and came back past 3PM. The lines were longer this time and I had to wait in line for maybe 15-20 minutes to get the room key card. It would've been nice if they served welcome drinks to guests checking in. Room Upon arrival in the room, I didn't expect much after reading the reviews here. The room came with a decent view though. True, it was dated but the bed was comfortable and big enough for 2 adults and 1 child. We booked the cheapest room and paid US$505 for 3 nights (via Booking.com) which was not bad for an Orchard Road location in the center of it all. The room was spacious by Singapore standards and even had a work desk and a sofa. The sofa was so old and tattered it needed reupholstering so badly. The bathroom was very clean, had the tub/shower fixture and even had a separate bidet. The blowdryer was this box type built-in device that was screaming 80s. It worked fine, however. Apart from the sofa, my major complaint would be the curtains. When I closed the curtains, I sneezed right away. I'm allergic to dust and I had to take anti-allergy medicine during the time we were there. I can't comment on the food because our rate didn't include breakfast and I didn't order room service nor ate at their outlets. CHECK-OUT Since we were leaving the hotel very early in the morning, I settled my bills the night before. The process was quick although when I went up to the room after settling the bill, the keycard didn't work anymore. I had to go back down and have the keycards reprogrammed. The lobby of the hotel was indeed located at the 5th floor but there are elevators on the ground floor that will take you straight to the rooms. No need to transfer elevators on the 5th level. You need a keycard to gain access to the room floors so security is not a problem for me. Would I stay at this hotel again? Given the right price and if I was in Singapore for shopping, definitely! For me, the advantage of having a great location outweighs the negatives. The other hotel with more or less the same price tag and location as this was Grand Park Orchard but I read in a review that it was noisy. True enough, when I walked to this area at night, there was this unexplained noise that sounded like hundreds of birds chirping all at the same time.

Universal Studios is right at the Harbourfront station, while Manila Bay Sands has its own station also - Bayfront station. Hotel Room and Access : We requested for a high floor-new wing room and we were granted with a 20th floor Orchard Wing Deluxe Room - Thank you again Mandarin Orchard for accomodating our request. It was a newly built room, that is why it looked good and no complaints whatsoever. There was an elevator that is exclusive for guests that goes to the Mandarin Gallery (shops/restaurants like Jones the Grocer, Marc Jacobs, Armani, etc) and there is also a separate access to the old wing (Main Tower) as well as the concierge. So the elevators are not crowded and they have elevators almost everywhere for every purpose - - you will actually get confused the first time. I have seen comments though on the checkin counters....given that it is a busy hotel, an improvement can be done in accomodating guests for checkin and checkout. There is always a line of about 4-5 guests on both counters....since everything is on the system, processing can still be improved but this didnt turn me off as we were not rushing at any point of our trip. Also, my roommate requested for a face towel and a sewing kit on 2 separate occasions and housekeeping came after 10-15 minutes - this also can be improved in terms of delivery time. Breakfast - Breakfast is very good as the choices are ample. They have a spread of Chinese/Singaporean dishes as well as Continental breakfast choices.

This is perhaps the trump card behind this hotel: a hotel with a strong heritage and sterling reputation in the heart of the tourist zone. The proximity to the Orchard MRT station helps a lot to all visitors whether on business or leisure. The irony of it is of course the number of foreign staff in the hotel and it would have been pretty bizarre for a visitor who would like to savor the authentic Singapore experience by staying in one of the country's established hotel. We had the opportunity to use the pool which was a 15mx5m affair. Any children would have loved the pool based on the simple fact that it's a swimming pool. The depth of the pool however was about 1.2m deep which means there is limited play here and the lack of a staff monitoring means extreme care has to be taken. Prior to the pool, I had called from the room to room service (the only viable option on the phone) to find out whether there was a changing room there. Twice I had called and nobody had picked up. Nevertheless, took my chances at the pool and viola! There were two fully equipped with showers and toilet facilities. No warm water though. You would want to change at the pool because it would have been simply awkward to walk through the hotel lobby past the hotel's triple three restaurant in your bathrobe and room slippers. More amusing when you walk back dripping wet! Ordered room service for my famished daughter after the swim and i was delighted to see an interactive feature on TV where the menu can be viewed along with full-colored photographs of the dishes. This is a good feature for our foreign visitors especially if they had to wonder what is beef kway teow. Placed the order via the interactive feature and I had a phone call from room service (surprise surprise) to confirm my order some 7 minutes later. I thought that was great common sense to confirm the order just in case the order was placed by some young meddling fingers. Ordered their famous chicken rice from chatterbox and it came about 20 mins later. Food was warm and aesthetically displayed. They were also generous with the condiments. Taste was as good as what would have been served in the restaurant. The bathroom was great and was equipped with a bathtub and a shower stall. The shower equipment (yes equipment) was one of those fancy massage-style shower with 5 shower heads. It took a while to figure out how to work them but it's not that difficult. it am not sure if this was a standard across all rooms though because I was told by the recpeption staff that I was upgraded to a club room in the orchard wing. Water pressure was great though despite being on the 27th floor. Flooring was marble so some care has to be taken when getting out of the shower. The body wash and shampoo was delightful and it had a French-sounding name. I was a bit dismayed when it turned out that it was \"Made in China\". Well I wouldn't expect to be provided Bvlgari toiletries (like Ritz-Carlton) but surely the hotel could have found a safer source of manufacturing? (Hint: Just remove that sentence on the next batch of bottles). To round it off, room was extremely clean yet not sanitized. I guess the recliner in the corner (not arm chair) gave it a more relaxed feel. Would I stay here again? Most likely not since it does feel like another Singapore deluxe luxury hotel devoid of a certain identity, but the quality of stay means it's a grape at option for any of my foreign friends visiting.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Honolulu, HI", "Title": "\u201cGREAT HOTEL\u201d", "Author": "Pointman1955", "ReviewID": "UR126912549", "Content": "This hotel has great service and very well kept facilitates.

Many guests came to make complains that their keycard stopped working (in the short span of 3 mins, 2 guests came to make complains) and that got me worried about having to come to the front desk to renew my card on a daily basis. Upon entering the room, I was appalled to find that the furnishings were rather old and needed repair (I stayed at the Orchard Wing on level 23). The lights were not working properly and the floor lamp and desk lamp had to be manually switched on and off. Lighting in the bathroom was also rather poor and I had to call the electrician to check the lights because it was too dim. The mini fridge door was broken so it was leaking water all over the cupboard. Room service took more than 40minutes (and I had to give a miss on picking up my guests at the airport because I was waiting for room service). The towel had obvious stains on them (huge brown patches) and was disgusting to use.

We booked 3 Premier Rooms. There were several issues during check-in but the subsequent reparations were so satisfactory that we have consequently put the incidents behind us. The reparations included upgrading one of our rooms to the Regency Suite (Room 2526 of the Orchard Wing), which is one below the Presidential Suite, complimentary access to the Meritus Club Lounge on Level 31 for Rooms 2526 and 2521, a bowl of fruit and 2 boxes of chocolate. The Regency Suite was luxurious and extremely spacious. It had 2 marble bathrooms, and a large living area and bedroom. The living area housed a 3-seater couch, a 6-person dining table and easily fitted 2 extra single beds. In the bedroom, there was a King bed, a make-up area, a massage chair and desk. The bed sheets were very comfortable and an exorbitant number of amenities were provided every day including razors, bathrobes, bottled water, English and Chinese newspaper, body lotion and shampoo/conditioner. However, we had to request for more bar soap on several occasions. My room was also served with complimentary Internet access, local telephone calls and 2 pieces of laundry daily. Turn-down service was offered every evening at a time convenient for us. Most of my requests were dealt with promptly and the hotel fulfilled some of my more obscure requests, such as my request for a permanent marker and to replace some flickering lamp lights. All the staff were very professional and courteous but I particularly commend the Duty Manager, Morana Dalimunthe, who helpfully resolved our issues at check-in and ensured that our stay was problem-free. We were treated exceptionally well on the phone by Reception, Concierge and the staff at the Meritus Club Lounge. I think this was in part due to us staying at the Regency Suite. For example, at Reception, I informed an attendant of my room number 2526 and I was immediately directed to the front of the line. The Meritus Club is restricted to guests staying in suites and on floors with access to the Lounge (Levels 26-32 of the Orchard Wing). It was a nice place to wind down: surf the internet, read magazines and newspapers, and eat. The Club serves buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails/dinner every day. The food, which included scallops, prawns, smoked salmon, crab etc., was varied, delicate and presented beautifully. We also had breakfast once on Level 5, which is open to all guests in the hotel. Although there was a greater range of food, it was certainly not as delicate, and the restaurant was crowded. The Meritus Club Lounge was a much better option. The hotel also has a swimming pool and a gym, which is open 24 hours and contains very good facilities. It is centrally located in the heart of Orchard Road, sandwiched in between Ngee Ann City (Takashimaya) and 313@Somerset. Paragon, ION, Tang Plaza and Shaw House are all within 5-10 minutes walking distance from the hotel.

Mandarin Orchard is a great example of this personal observation of mine. It's obvious that the hotel building is old, but it does not lack of space. I stayed here for four nights in the Main Tower and the location is surely unbeatable. It is at the heart of Orchard Rd with all the major shopping malls within walking distance (Ngee Ann City, Paragon, Ion to name a few). If I'm being very critical, though, there are a few things which stopped me from rating this property 5/5. First is the lobby, which is located on 5th floor. There is not a single seating accommodation provided. It must be a conscious and deliberate decision by the management, one that I don't see the logic of. I had a local friend coming over one day and while waiting he was forced to wander around aimlessly for 10 minutes while waiting for us get ready. I have a suspicion that the management is trying to make guests wait at the bar of Triple 3 Restaurant which is located right across the reception counter. Not long after checking in, our bags got delivered to our room but one of them was not ours. Not a fatal mistake, and certainly one that got solved instantly, however I felt like I should mention this as one of the reasons this hotel is not getting a perfect score in my eyes. Also, the air-con in our room was very warm initially. We reported this to the hotel before going out for dinner. When we came back, the problem had been fixed. I remember staying at this hotel fifteen years ago with my parents and the bathrooms have not changed since then. The rooms at the Main Tower are kept simple and un-fussy. My room was nice and clean although not overly impressive. The bathroom was a different story altogether. It feels like the decor in the room and bathroom is disjointed. The bathroom is what's left from an entirely different era. Gloomy grey tiles, black stone counter top, shower in the bathtub, and the wall-hung hair dryer all look very outdated and tired. On the first night, there was some banging/knocking noise coming from the room right above us. We complained to the Duty Manager and this issue, too, was addressed efficiently and effectively. Wi-fi is chargeable and in this day and age, it is simply unacceptable for a hotel that already charges such a premium to make more money from wi-fi. Since we rely heavily on internet for work, we had no choice but to fork out more money for it. Now I'll move on to the positives of this hotel, apart from the obvious: location. Breakfast menu is one of the most diverse I've ever seen and very delicious. This is a busy hotel with high traffic, which can either be good or bad. In this case, it's definitey good because it's easy to get a taxi (we never had to wait for more than 5 minutes) but it's very quiet in the rooms. Not once did we hear any kids running up and down the hallway or people talking loudly. Last year I stayed for one night at this hotel at the Orchard Wing (which I suspect to be the newer wing).

The hotel is perfectly located for shopping and business travelers on the best section of Orchard Road. It would not be appropriate for a family with young children. The layout of the hotel is rather odd as the lower floors are a shopping mall and, although the taxi drop off area enters into a lobby, the check in area is on the 5th floor. There are two wings, the Main Wing and the newer Orchard Wing and it is a bit confusing. We stayed in the Orchard Wing. The room was quite nice, large and attractively furnished and looked out over Orchard Road. It had obviously been recently renovated. The bathroom was very big and had a separate shower stall and toilet area as well as a big bathtub. Extremely clean and modern. There is no booklet describing hotel services but if you turn on the TV all the hotel info is available. The amenities were basic no high end brand names but adequate. I had read from other reviews about the lack of hair conditioner, the meager towel supply, and the single bar of soap. Yes, there was only one very small bar of soap and we had to move it from sink to shower to tub as needed. This was easily corrected as I merely asked the maid for soap and was presented with two addition bars. Towel supply varied, sometimes face towels, some days none, some days two bath towels others four towels. Almost comic. Amazingly, there was no clock in the room. These shortcomings, although minor, should not occur in a five star hotel. Wifi was free with our room package, but breakfast was not included so I can't comment on that. We did eat in the Chatter Box restaurant which has been famous for its Hainan chicken rice dish for decades. The restaurant is located downstairs attached to the shopping mall. It was simple coffee shop type decor but the food was good as was the service. This hotel has no atmosphere or charm but it is functional , clean and superbly located. The service was prompt and courteous. Paragon Mall is directly across the street. There is a seafood restaurant in Paragon called Fish & Co. which is a simple mall type restaurant but the fish was wonderful. Try the fish combo cooked and served on a metal plate.

The room I had was room 2435 on main tower which are ideal in size in line with the room rates, rooms I think has been recently upgraded with nice natural wood decor and bathroom is quite modern same as seen on their website Beds and pillows are comfortable, aircon is quiet and coolness is adjustable all creating a good night sleep after a hectic day of shopping But some small matters such as the sofa although comfy, the cover has seen better days, also housekeeping should take note of the tiles lining in the shower area which is black with mould. (As per picture attached) these minor overlook may sometimes put off some guests at times. The Mandarin Orchard is situated right on famous Orchard Road well known for shoppers and location is one of the best with huge shopping mall such as Takashimiya ( Ngee Ann City ) directly on the left, 313 Somerset on the right, Paragon directly opposite, and with other all major shopping centers, also MRT underground station within 5 minutes walk away. After 3 nights of wonderful stay, on checking out had minor problem of concierge services, as had to call 2 times and waited 20 minutes for luggage pickup which in the end decided to carry bags myself but staffs on main lobby were very apologetic as quite understandable for time taken been a 1000 room hotel and assisted to fast track my checkout. Overall stay was one of the best I had in years maybe largely due to the frontline staffs\u2019 warmness with genuine service to please towards hotel quests and will definitely return to stay in future when I am back in Singapore not only for shopping and food but to bring back fond memories of yester years of this hotel", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dhaka City, Bangladesh", "Title": "\u201cNo seating in the lobby area!\u201d", "Author": "Saifurrbd", "ReviewID": "UR125575836", "Content": "We stayed 5 nights in 6 rooms (Family booking through Tradewinds).

The hotel is located in the heart of Orchard Road, 5 minutes from Somerset MRT Station and 10 minutes from Orchard MRT Station. The hotel entrance was a bit uncomfortable because it gave the impression of small and cramped area. Then we were directed to the lobby area which is more comfortable. The check in is quick and efficient. When we first arrived at the room our impression was the room are nice and comfortable. But on the way to our room, we smell smoke from cigarettes and yet we ordered a non smoking room located on a non smoking floor. So that was pretty disturbing. Then on the second night, we found a leakage on the sink of our bathroom coming down to the floor. It was brown and a bit smelly. I called guest service and waited until 30 minutes without receiving any response. Then I called again directly to housekeeping and someone from maintenance showed up in about 10 minutes. He then found out that the leak came from the walls of the bathroom. He cannot find a solution since it is pretty late in the evening. He called housekeeping and asked for some extra towels and put it below the sink to prevent the leak from getting into the floor. I reported this to the guest relation and ask if there is a solution to this problem because it is pretty annoying staying in a 5 star hotel with a leak in your bathroom. She said she will bring it up to manager and will come with a solution in the morning. I left her my cell number since I will be out all day on the following morning. So me and my wife went out and did not receive a call. So I was guessing that the problem was solved. But when we returned, the same problem occurred. I had to raise my temper to the guest service and again they can only come with a towel solution. When I checked out the following day, there were not a single word of apology from any of the staff. And when I complained to the receptionist, she said no note were given on the condition of my room. This was pretty disappointing. I expect a superb service from a hotel using the name of Mandarin.

I started asking her questions about the cakes, while she was handling a customer's billing. Instead of saying excuse me, I'll get back to you after this, politely. She asked me: 'are you a guest here?' I was shocked, and just to see how she would react, I answered: 'no!' Then, she just brushed me off and took off without any excuse. The room itself is so-so.

The hotel was the preferred venue of the meeting organizer but was not actually my first choice, at least for the price. I was hoping it had improved from the time I last stayed there but sadly it wasn't. I was in a room at the Main Tower and admittedly some improvements had been made such as the new entertainment system, which now has better quality TV channels that included a few HD channels, which was a first for me at a hotel in Singapore. The room itself was seemingly refreshed but a few of the facilities were still rather dated and should have been dispensed with. The old love seat in the bedroom, the shower in the bath and the bidet are a few such features. There was likewise a bathroom scale that was grimy and damaged and clearly needing replacement. The bed was also quite odd. It was a queen sized bed, which you would not typically find in a hotel of this category. Admittedly it was comfortable and I did not have any issues sleeping but usually you would expect a king sized bed. I also found that a few comments from previous reviewers on the lack of face towels as well as turndown service were indeed true. Now these are small things in my view but if you are competing with other hotels in the vicinity then I must say that even the little things do count. There were a few other little things that I also noted. I didn't get my morning paper on any of the 4 days I stayed. At first I thought it was because of our company rate but apparently my colleagues who were on the same rate as I got their newspapers. I also found that my used towels were taken daily despite the hotel's policy on saving on laundering towels guests intend to reuse and signify so by hanging in the appropriate places. Worse was that one day the towel was not even replaced. I had breakfast only once at Triple Three and I came in early so did not have the opportunity to observe whether they had resolved the long queues that usually set in around 7 AM. While the food spread was admittedly good, I still don't think it is worth the price. Frankly though, this observation really applies to most hotels I've stayed at in Singapore so not a specific issue with the Mandarin.

PROS: - Location. It's in the middle of Orchard Road and just a few minutes walk to the Somerset MRT or the Orchard MRT. - Room was simple but nice and comfy, overlooking Orchard Road. Bed and pillow were comfy. - On the 3rd floor of Mandarin Gallery, there's a great breakfast place called Wild Honey - I want to commend Duty Manager Isabel. Upon checkout at 12nn, we left our luggage at the concierge and went around Orchard and Clarke Quay to kill time before heading to the airport. I realized I had forgotten to check the safe of the room upon checkout and my passport was still inside. I called up Mandarin and mentioned the problem and Isabel was able to sort things out and I got back my passport when I returned to the concierge to claim my luggage. CONS: - Lobby is on the 5th floor and not the ground floor - Upon check in, front desk didn't ask if we preferred a smoking or non-smoking room. The room I got smelled like cigarette smoke even though it was just cleaned but the room my friends got on the same floor but further down the hall did not seem to be a smoking room. We weren't sure if we were put on a smoking floor or not though the hallway did not smell like a usual designated smoking floor. - No turn down service. Got back to the room late at night after spending the day out to find that the curtains were not drawn and the bed not turned down. It's no big deal but other 5-star hotels I've stayed at have this service so I was surprised Mandarin didn't do this. - Bathroom amenities incomplete. Only 1 bar of soap, no face towels (bathroom had just the 2 bath towels and 1 hand towel), no emery board, no sewing kit. - Comforter could have been thicker (surprised it was thin) since the room was always cold even if we had adjusted it to low and at a temp of 25. - We asked for late check out (Mandarin check out time is at 11am). Front desk lady said she could give us a late check out up to 12nn without charge. Other hotels' normal check out is at 12nn. Check in time: 2pm We arrived from the airport at around 10:30 am, checked in and left our bags at the front desk because the rooms (we booked 4 rooms) were not ready yet. At 2:30pm, we came back to the hotel to get our room keys and 1 room was still not ready. Our friend staying in that room had to follow up for the room until past 3:00pm by phone until he finally went back down to the front desk to make sure they were able to give him their room key. Neither pro/con: - In my friends' room, the hotel slippers that they used were removed (instead of being placed neatly by the bedside) and new ones were placed in the closet.

When I came back at 2.40pm, the hotel told us to wait for another 30min! They said the housecleaning just started. I got so pissed and complained, after 10 min complaining and some supervisor said that he will treat us for coffee. But we were not in mood so we went out for some appointments with our friend. What really pissed me off the most is...the guy kept blaming governemnt's policy of not giving some monetary supports blah blah blah... Does it really matter for tourists? 2. So much cost reductions I was amazed such a big name, so little towels they give. 2 big bath towel, 1 middle bath towel, no face towel...even 3 star hotels in Singapore provide minimum 2 face towels! 3.

They interior is need of some modernising and the rooms need sound proofing urgent. You can basically hear people talk normally next door. Finding your room can be a little confusing as when you check in at ground floor, they give you your room card and show you to the lift. The lift however will take you to the second lobby which is on level 5. From there you will have to find someone to show you to the lifts which go to your room as there are no signs. These are past the checkout desks and completing in a different part of the building. When you have been on a 13 hour flight NOT including the extra hours spent at the airports, transfers, 8 hour jet lag this can be a little confusing. Good points\u2026 The hotel is in a great location if you like shopping and malls. Not to good if you want some traditional Asian culture away from the branded stores you find in most major cities now. For cheap beer and good priced food go to China or India towns. You can from level 5 go straight into the mall, so don\u2019t have to leave the air conditioned buildings to go to the malls. Pool is ok. Staff are actually very polite and smile, which I like. If you need to use the business centre outside the hours of operation just ask main desk and they will open it for you, always good for last minute checking in and printing your boarding pass. Good link to the MRT, buy a pre-paid card for $12 at the station as this will save you money on top ups and each journey is cheaper than singles each time, there is however a $5 non-deposit included in the price so only get if you will be travelling more than 4 return journeys during your stay.

The room is very quiet, and because the room faces the east, i had a superb wake-up view of Marina Sands Hotel and beyond to the South China Sea with all the ships on anchor. TV switches on automatically and plays some soothing music when you slot the doorcard into its place. You can watch all sorts of news and entertainment channels. The bathroom is spacious and clean. You have to climb into the bathtub/shower place so maybe not so easy for seniors, but I am not 100% certain. Sometimes the towels have a dull damp odour but if I put them on the floor they get changed anyway so it may not be a big deal. Each morning the local newspaper is delivered to your door, and it is quite entertaining and informative if you are interested in Singapore as well as world affairs. The staff are all very pleasant and helpful. Taxi wait on a rainy day can be quite tricky though as there seem to be a lot of VIPs from Indonesia or China staying at the hotel and they seem to be allowed to jump queue. One time I ordered the famed hainanese chicken rice online through the TV and for some reason it did not get noticed until quite late at night when I could no longer wait and decided to give room service a call. Not worth the wait and certainly not worth the price at SGD35. I was told by locals that Boon Tong Ke a chicken rice shop is much better. There is a lot of choose from at breakfast table, except they don't offer the local kopi-o! I would think it would be nice if in addition to the espresso and cappucino and all the fancy coffee that it can probably provide also some butter toast and kopi-o!

My TIP - carry your own bags to your room if you plan to use them within 3 hours of getting your room. Sadly the hotel's baggage \"system\" is BROKEN!

It was told that our room was vacant in their system, as a bit annoyed about this, i then called the operator to speak with their Duty Manager, approximately 5 minutes later, a young guy called me back and offered assistance. I then told him about the whole story, and was informed that I have vacated and settled the bill, this was surprised me as i have just woke up by the time their Housekeeping guy break our do not disturb sign, he then promised to re-instate our room status in their system, i guess this never been done, as at 1.30 pm another Housekeeping entered our room despite the do not disturb sign still in place..

Seems they are rushing when they cleaned the room- this is on the second and third days.

The room was large but tired, marks on carpet, old style well used furniture- we were told at check in that it was recently renovated which it clearly was not. Bathroom large and dark, and shower door did not close properly and floor got very wet and slippery. We asked for nonsmoking and the room was OK but smokers in the corridors made the whole floor smoky and we kept the aircon on to keep smoky atmosphere from entering the room. Only 2 ordinary teabags provided throughout entire stay of three nights, a few ordinary amenities provided which were not replaced- only bath towels provided - we requested face washers and hand towels and were brought the latter only- 3SD room service charge for ice as there was no self serve ice. Gym was disappointing- basically machines set up in boring old surrounds- several machines out of order. Beware Internet charges- it is 30SD per day per device- so an iPad and iPhone counts as 2 devices. Finally on charges- hotel took full charges on my credit card a week or so BEFORE I arrived- not just a deposit. This was unexpected.

Needless to say, after all the recent major renovations to the hotel, the place looks pretty impressive....except maybe the rooms in Orchard Wing. I had to make a change to my arrival time and ended up requiring an early check in. The staff were (as always) very friendly and helpful through the check in process, but told me that they did not have any rooms with a king bed currently available, as I had requested, and offered me one available twin room on a lower floor. Unfortunately, this was an adjoining room with a very thin door separating the rooms. As such, I was kept awake all night by the young kid next door who was talking and crying all night and very early in the morning. I called the reception at 6am to complain about this and asked if I could change rooms, they said there was one room available. I won't go into details, but after 20-30 minutes of waiting in my room for them to call me back I decided just to go downstairs with my packed luggage and talk to them myself. Luckily I did as it was very busy at the reception this early in the morning so I doubted if they were going to get to call me back for at least another half hour or more. I soon got to talk to someone at reception who managed to get me an available room in the Main Tower. The room was SO much nicer than the one in the Orchard Tower!!! It was larger, had awesome views. The first room kind of reminded me of a Chinese massage parlor, but I won't elaborate, but just to mention that awesome views of the city was much better than looking into a blank wall of the building next door. Since I was in Singapore for a few meetings only, I didn't get to use many of the amenities, except the gym. It was ok, with a few cardio and exercise machines, but maybe 2-3 sets of light dumbbells. I have a feeling that this may just be a temporary location for the gym as there are buffet counters, mini fridges, etc. in here which is obviously where an executive lounge used to be, or will be in the future. I took a quick peak in one of the storage rooms thinking there was perhaps more fitness equipment in there, but it was just stacked with tables and chairs. Plus, the place was too nicely decorated to be a proper gym, so I'm hoping the hotel is actually planning to put a proper gym in the hotel. Part of the new renovations to the hotel includes a connected shopping mall called the Mandarin Gallery (Galleria?). I don't do much shopping when in Singapore, but it's good there are nice restaurants, cafes, provision shops, a money changer, etc. nearby. Anything else you don't find here you can almost certainly find at Takashimaya next door, or somewhere along Orchard Rd. I loved the fact that there was an outdoor MacDonald's kiosk across the road for a quick and cheap breakfast. The only real complaint I would have is more to do with the design of the hotel. Once you're dropped off at the entrance lobby, you have to take a lift up to the 5th floor to check in, then depending on which tower you're assigned to, you have to walk and talk yet another different set of lifts to your floor. It just seemed like a maze to get anywhere and I was sometimes taking the wrong set of lifts, then wondering where my room had disappeared to.

And it was just amazing. These are 5 reasons why this place blew my mind 1) Welcomed by pretty receptionists. I may be biased since the receptionists were Filipinas but they were tall, slender, pleasing to look at and very good with English. From the moment I stepped out of the taxi I was greeted with a smile and felt like they were expecting us to come. 2) Divine bathroom. Period. I am very meticulous when it comes to hotel bathrooms and the one in our room had all the basic 5-star hotel amenities. We enjoyed a nice bubble bath. :) 3) No questions asked turn down service. It's either they were spying on us or they had CCTV cameras. When my girlfriend went out for a snack in McDonalds (right accross the hotel) when we got back up the hotel, our room was cleaned and we had something special prepared. 4) Something special for our anniversary. We were given a bottle of wine. And being the ever so stingy Filipino that my girlfriend is, she forced me to call room service to ask if it's complimentary or if it will be charged to our bill. And the answer was, \"Sir, compliments from our manager. Happy Anniversary.\" We drank the whole bottle and had an amazing evening. 5) Did not want to leave. This hotel makes you want to stay forever. The bathroom especially, we took a guiltless 30 minute shower each time we would find the excuse to. The service and staff was very neat looking with their uniform and they performed amazingly. Hands down, this is THE hotel to stay in when you visit Singapore.

Sales department is very helpful and cooperative with the room bookings when I contacted them directly to do the bookings. 1st visit : Entrance from Orchard Link, your taxi will drop you off to a small and very busy so called lobby. Greeted by the most friendly concierge ever, Mr. Bakar. Good Job for the concierge. The lobby at the 5th floor. You can see the swimming pool from the lobby.This great hotel got to do something with their check in system. Our check in for 5 (five) rooms took almost an hour. When we got back to check in, it's almost 6.00 pm! Rooms are spacious and Ok, not too fancy up to the hotel standard, our guests are satisfied and said the enjoy the rooms and the bathroom are clean. Overall: We are satisfied with Mandarin Orchard : location and facilities, but check in process need more organization. 2nd visit : As our previous check in time took more than an hour to finish, we visit the hotel early before our guests to hand out their copy passport to make the check in faster. But, still.. when the group arrived, they looked confused about their booking system, and.. we have to wait a while. Don't know why that happens. The hotel are fully booked and very busy at that time. And.. the sales person contact me one day before we arrived, and offered me to move our guests to other hotel -with a free upgrade to a club room at the new hotel- because they needed the rooms for other additional booking. Hmm.. I don't know about you, but we booked Mandarin Orchard because we wanted to stay AT THE MANDARIN ORCHARD. Not some place else. I said No to the offer, and wonder why they even bother to asked? The rooms are still in good conditions, the guests are happy and satisfied with the rooms and staff service. Until the check out time, they charged us a twin deluxe with 1(one) person occupant with a triple room charge -which we canceled already and switch to a deluxe twin- maybe because they're fully booked, the information slipped. Overall : We are quite satisfied with the hotel services. But be prepared for a rather time consuming check in time. The hotel really need to upgrade their check in computer system.

I had also read about the legendary \"long wait\" to register. When we landed, we were quickly directed to the 5th floor (I think) where the registration process was underway. It looked like there would be a long wait but surprisingly there were enough staff mingling with guests and directing them to vacant lines. Overall the process took place about 10 minutes and I don't think this is bad considering the 80+ people waiting to register. The next surprise was being upgraded to a larger room. The room was immaculately clean, well stocked with towels and clearly smelling \"fresh\". It was on the 28th floor and faced Orchard Street. There was always a cleaning person on the floor. We always got extra bottles of water, towels and at the risk of sounding repetitive, they kept the room spotlessly clean. The concierge on the ground floor was always at hand to guide, to provide umbrellas and of course order a cab. The entire staff in-fact were always helpful. I must mention an incident at breakfast one morning. My wife, my 7 year old and I arrived to find a long line of people waiting to get into the area for breakfast. There was a travel group in that day and close to 40 people were in-line. I walked to the front of the line and was quickly spotted by a staff member. He looked at my daughter and immediately found a table in the bar area for us. Within 5 minutes we had our own table. I wouldn't mind waiting in line but its hard for a 7 year old! The only reason I haven't given it a 5 star rating is because in today's age, it is important that connectivity is affordable. I travel the world and have encountered every sort of pricing on Internet access at hotels. This one rates as one of the worst. People who can afford to stay at this hotel are clearly in need of connectivity. I don't mind if there is a charge but $30 a day is ridiculous especially because most people would not use it for more than a couple of hours a day (if they are on holiday). The hourly rate too is absurd. I got around the issue by buying a Star Mobile pre-paid SIM card that gave me connectivity at ridiculously cheap rates. There is a 7-11 around the corner that helped with top ups. I also thought the restaurant on the top floor was a bit over-rated for the prices they charged. Perhaps why I didnt see a crowd even on a Saturday night! The swimming pool is small but very functional. My baby loved the fact it wasn't deep at any end. This is perhaps the first pool that I have seen which has the same depth at both ends. Honestly, I think its a brilliant idea. If I was to choose a hotel to stay in Singapore, this would be my top 5 choices. I would want to stay elsewhere only because I wanted to be away from Orchard Street.

The location is perfect if you want to go shopping in Singapore. One day you can venture on the right side of the road and another to the left. Perfect. But that's the only really good thing about this hotel. The bedroom we had was on the 25th flr of the Main Wing. It's supposedly refurbished but a coat of paint, new carpet, and lcd tv cannot hide the tiredness of the room. What I really hated about it was the bath. It's true about some of the reviews here saying that the water in the shower does not heat up well in the mornings. It is sometimes at best, lukewarm. Also, forget about taking a long hot shower at the end of the day as the shower drain does not work well. With the water not even on half blast, a puddle forms to your ankles right away thus making you want to hurry up and finish your bath. A pungent smell also comes out of the tub when the shower is on, smells like bad drainage. As this is a very old hotel, expect to hear people in the hallway and your neighbors' tv. The bed was definitely too hard, but pillows were good. Sheets had holes that were sewn. I guess this hotel is a very busy one because of its location. We were there for 3 days and every single day you would see a long line at check-in. Thank goodness when we checked in and out we didn't have to wait too long!!! Internet was around S$65 for 2 days... and mind you, it was PER device. They don't make this clear anywhere so be warned if you use a laptop and iphone/cellphone in the room. I contested double billing for this and good thing they waived one charge right away.

However, after our horrible experience on March 28 when we check in, we might opt to stay in other hotels instead. When we checked in on March 28, I asked for an extra bed in the room. The front desk clerk told me she will give me a room with 3 beds instead. What she didn't tell me was that there was a renovation going on - we just found out from a written notice in our table that we might find gondolas passing up and down our windows and we just have to close the blinds to ensure privacy since they were painting. What they didn't tell us though was that with the painting came drilling and hammering. Sure enough, at around 5 p.m., the gondola carrying two workers was outside our window ( we didn't close our blinds) and the drilling and hammering started, drowning out our tv's speakers. We complained to the duty manager and she was nice enough to go to our room personally, see the situation herself and offer to transfer us to another room. She went down to arrange it and when the operator called us, I informed the operator that we will just transfer in the morning before 9 am instead since we were already exhausted and didnt want to pack our bags again. She agreed to take note and inform the duty manager of our wishes. The next morning, I went down to get the keys to the new room and the new duty manager was not as accommodating as the first one. He told me abruptly that I can only transfer in the afternoon. When I raised a fuss since I told him it was the female duty manager who arranged for our transfers, he reluctantly agreed to send a porter to our room for our bags. My husband was very displeased with his attitude but we let it pass. When I checked out on March 30, I wrote a complaint on our experience and submitted it to the front desk clerk to be given to management. I waited for months for them to reply to our email complaint regarding the lack of information regarding the renovation, especially on the side of the front desk people who were suppose to inform guests and not give them rooms on the side that was being renovated and also we complained about the rude attitude of the male duty manager who didn't want to transfer us .

Takashimaya and Paragon, two big shopping centers, are located just across the street from this hotel. Next to Takashimaya are Atria and Ion. This hotel also has its own shopping arcade. To me, no other hotel in the vicinity can beat the convenience of this hotel. From street level, the elevators go directly to room floors (Orchard Wing), otherwise, a short walk to the Main Tower's elevators. I literally shopped till I dropped.....in my own room. The hotel had its heyday when it was opened in the seventies and up to the eighties. It was one of the most luxurious properties in Singapore then. Now, although it is rated as a five star hotel, it can not really compete with the luxury of other newer properties. This hotel is very popular with Indonesian visitors who mainly come for shopping and getting medical services at Mount Elizabeth hospital nearby. As I stayed as this hotel quite frequently for many years, I find that it needs improvements in terms of rooms furnishings, amenities, etc. I like the staff because I feel they are very sincere and seem to recognize me from my previous visits. This especially goes to door attendants, bellboys and waiters at the restaurants. Rooms in the Main Tower are considerably large at more than 30 squared meter with modern style furnishing. Bathrooms come with a bath tub (no separate shower), double washbasins, a toilet and a bidet. The rooms need refurbishment as they are starting to age. In my last stay there I stayed in the Main Tower. I was informed that the hotel was refurbishing rooms in Orchard Wing and started selling those rooms with a premium. In my experience, the rooms in this section of the hotel are much smaller - there is barely enough space to add a rollaway (extra) bed. The bathrooms have a bathtub, a separate shower stall, a toilet and a washbasin. It's better to get a room facing the street (in both towers) because otherwise rooms on the other sides of both towers get noise from cooling towers of the building next door. This property has more than one thousand rooms, so lines sometimes get long for checking in or out. It's better to provide some extra time especially during long weekend or holidays.

Upon arrival in Mandarin at 11.45am we already notice a very long queue and at lvl 5, there were 3 staff serving the check in counter with 3 lines formed behind it so we join the queue. after 10 minutes of queueing, a lady came and told us that she is forming a new queue which is 1 line for all 3 counter and she put the person behind me first because she approached the queue line from behind. When i told her my dissatisfaction, she assure me that she apologizes and promises that once a person is available, it will be given to me. I then ask her why is there such a long queue (it was until the Bar on 5) she mention that the hotel is expecting 600 new arrival today and beside the check out time is 12 since i have not eaten my lunch, I took my family out first, thinking that maybe when I return closer to 1pm, there will be more lines for check in and less lines for check out. to my horror, when i return at 12.30 the lines was even longer and it took me a full hour to check in... 10minutes at the desk where the staff was unable to differentiate between King size bed and a Queen size bed (i booked 2 room and ask for both to be king and she keep repeating that all the hotel room is King and i get 1 room that is king but smaller than the other) another reason was that 1 of our room was not available, it was not cleaned yet she ask for us to return by 15.00 (1.5 hour more...by then the time is already 13.30 and my friend's ROM wedding is at 14.00) disgruntled, i went up to 1 of my rooms and ask for my suitcase to be delivered straightaway as my wife's high heels was in one of the luggage. after waiting 10 minutes, we called the concierge. the reply was baggage is already on its way up then after waiting for another 5 minutes, we called again, getting the same reply \"its coming, its coming\" they say finally after another 5-10 minutes wait, we decided that we could not wait any longer as we are already late so my wife storm down while i waited at the room in case the luggage was there first. then a phone call came, a man claiming that he could not find our luggage!!! my wife had to go down personally to the storage room and retrieve her heels before taking a taxi to the ROM when we arrive, the event was already over.... even the bride&groom has returned to their home @hougang. we return at 5pm to Mandarin after apologizing to everyone about the reason of our lateness. however the story did not end here. even at 5pm, our room was still not ready (the one that was promised at 3pm) after ticking off the person that was checking us in, she suggested us that a king size room is available but on different floor. We are not taking anymore \"bs\" from this hotel. we stood our ground asking for a nearby room at 20th floor where the other room was situated in. She then mention that there is 1 room but it's a double bed. exhausted, we accept it anyway since it is just next door. 2034 & 2035 Later at the room after dinner, we try calling the operator to put us through for someone whom we are able to voice our complaint to. a duty manager she answers and she told us to wait a moment when she try to put the duty mgr to the phone. after 5 minutes, no one pick up the phone. so i hang up. i was tired and promises myself that i will talk with the duty mgr personally tmrw. the next day i go down to the lobby asking for the duty manager. when she arrive, it turns out that she was the one who check us in at 5pm (ms. morana) i told her Mandarin was supposed to be a 5 star hotel but what i just experienced is a poor poor service. i break it down to her in 4 points. 1. long queue 2. luggage issue 3. unavailability of our room 4. phone operator who left the phone she apologizes and offer us a complimentary breakfast. I just missed my friend's wedding because of the 2 hour delay at the hotel and the best Mandarin can do is giving me a free breakfast?

Save your money - a 3-star is better!\u201d", "Author": "SunDiver", "ReviewID": "UR110294778", "Content": "This is the cheapest 5-star hotel in SIngapore on booking.com -- with good reason! The staff, the building facilities and the service are awful and the only saving grace is the location smack in the center on Orchard Road. First, my gripes about the building. There are no chairs or sofas in the lobby on the ground floor. So when my dad (who walks with a cane) was waiting for a friend to pick us up, he had to stand around for 20 minutes. When I asked the concierge for a chair and why they didn't have sofas -- the reply was \"security reasons\". So the Mandarin has security concerns, but the Grand Hyatt and the Marriott across the street don't? I'm sure the hotel manager would say the lobby is being renovated, but when we stayed here a month ago, there were still no chairs. The hotel is designed so badly that you get off on floor 1, then take an elevator to floor 5, then change elevators to go to your hotel room. There are two wings which are completely separate towers -- looks like the hotel has bought out another property later and tried to combine the two into one brand. So if you are stuck in the Tower Wing (which we were first time around) then you have the old, horrid, dingy rooms. And if you get the Orchard Wing (where we stayed the second time around), the rooms are better - much better. But wait..... we had two rooms - one on level 14 and the other on level 22 - and you can go up in the same elevator, but if you want to come down from level 22 to level 14 you have to use a different bank of elevators and you need to come down to the lobby level and go back up a different set of elevators. We wasted most of our time doing this! The hotel has sold it's soul to shopping. It looks like most of level 1-4 has been turned into a shopping mall, which is why the hub of the hotel (lobby, restaurants) are on level 5. Chatterbox restaurant used to be at the ground level, but they have moved this to level 5. And there are no chairs or sofa to wait in the lobby either -- they just direct you to sit in the hotel restaurant instead. I wanted to upgrade one room to a suite - but the receptionist said it would cost an additional $700 per night, taking the room cost to approx $1000++. I refused -- for that kind of money I can stay at a suite in the Raffles Hotel! They then offered a club room at $170 extra, but you know what -- the room is the same size, just on the club floor. But kids are not allowed into the club facilities despite paying for it? So what am I supposed to do with them -- give them up for adoption? And to confirm that the hotel hates kids - get this! The TV has news, Indonesian, Korean, Japanese, Arabic - you name it - channels, but NO KIDS CHANNEL. So when we woke up at 7am and asked if there was a kids channel, the operator said that there is a one hour kids program on channel # 7 between 0900-1000. And what was I supposed to do at 0700 -- operator says, take your kids for a walk or a swim! So once again - the facilities are horrid! The service is unexceptional, uninspired and sometimes downright rude. We didn't get our luggage for 30 minutes, and my kids were sleepy after a long haul so I went to the lobby to check. My 6 year old daughter was with me and when she stepped about a foot into the aisle next to the reception desk (but not even behind it), the receptionist, Mr. Tommy throws a fit -- saying that you cant come in here. I asked him firmly whether this was an airport and whether we had committed a security breach. He smiled but didn't say anything. So I asked him again - even more firmly - and then he apologized. All this for a kid straying a foot forward! Imagine my surprise when the same Tommy shafts me at check out time! My bill came to $859.78, so I handed over $1059.75 expecting $200 in change. Now I haven't seen a 5c coin in Singapore, so I thought this would be fine. But no, Tommy insists on the 3c, so you know what, I handed him 5c and asked him for my $200 and 2c change back! Now the sneaky Tommy hands me a 5c Malaysian coin from his own wallet (not the hotel till). I only spotted this later when I had already left the hotel, but can you imagine the cheek of the guy! Finally, it doesn't look like the concierge desk has it's act in order. I had a package waiting for me, but it didn't show up on their system after I had checked in. The concierge desk said they had no record of it. Yet when I insisted that the package was there, they go into the luggage room too look for it.... and find it in like two minutes! Would have saved me the cost of three long distance calls to my Singaporean friend (who was overseas, hence the drop off) to locate the package if only they had checked even once without saying \"no\". Two good service experiences -- we called Room Service to ask for the kids menu, but when I said I would think about it, the day called back in 10 mins to check if we had decided. And our next door neighbours were making a lot of noise at 6am so when I called to complain, the duty manager said he would speak to them -- and he did! Wi-fi is frightfully expensive, beware! The exchange rate that the hotel gives is horrid - take the elevator down to level 4 and go to the money changer there instead. He usually beats his rate by 2c for a decent amount, and is good to do business with! We didn't try any of the restaurants except the breakfast once (which was good). I have been too scarred by my experience to stay at the Mandarin again. Farewell Mandarin - for ever and ever! The sooner you turn completely into a shopping mall the better - because clearly the facilities are more geared to you maximizing your revenues from retail space rather than running a hotel. The best thing about the hotel is the location - smack in the middle of Orchard Road - so the sooner it decides it wants to be a shopping mall, the better!", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cWe expected the worst!

In general I cant fault anything in the rooms. However come on free internet for all. I got it from a corporate deal but my colleague didn't. 5 dollar per hour or 25 per day I think the rate was.

Location is great. orchard on rolling distance, those that want budget food have kopitiam around the corner where all sort of Asian food are served streetwise and for 5-7 dollar per portion. Great shopping, lots of restaurants and for me that like the more quiet part I walk up to Emerald Hill for a quiet beer after my day working. To be honest get the right tower and its a great stay. and if you look at my previous reports you'll see I usually dont say this. Even a small candy to my little one when we left. Just that extra I usually never receive in Singapore ( I asked reception staff and those that had served me were malaysian Chinese and not Singaporean., that's probably why service was so much more than I usually get in Singapore..)

I was pleased by the big changes. I miss the grand and traditional lobby of 2007 facing orchard road, with its decorative columns, but I don't miss the messy halls near the lobby with their cheap air and oppressive black marble. The new lobby on the 5th floor is sleek, subdued and clean-looking (but be warned: no chairs, sofas, or seating areas). A mix-up with the bell service forced me to leave my check in line and return to the first floor entrance hall to retrieve my passport, but that was a minor issue. I was very pleased to be told that my room was ready for me at 1030 am (requested by email a day earlier). My orchard wing deluxe room was comfortable, rather traditional-looking (with Chinese accents) and nothing to rave about, but a notch better than the main tower room I had in 2007 (which had fake wood panels and felt smaller). The 11th floor view was marred in the daytime by the dominating big black mass of the Grand Park Orchard hotel across the street, but that's not the Mandarin's fault of course. I found the room lighting a bit on the dark side (a friend of mine found it to be just right, with all the lights on). There was a dark spot right where the baggage stand is (I'm glad the baggage stand is a solid platform, not a flimsy rack). I liked the marble floor in the entry area --- nice touch! The bed was a large king-size, a bit firmer than I liked, but nonetheless comfortable (and the pillows were huge). Room was just about the right size. Bedside lights refused to come on on the second night, until I removed and replaced the key card in the master slot ... then the lights worked perfectly well. The bathroom was even better.... a separate shower, a stained-glass window above the bathtub that reflected light into the bedroom area (a classy twist on the usual bathtub window), a spacious feeling over all. Service was friendly all throughout, but I noted a number of lapses: no bath mat towel on the second night (I stayed three nights), no hand towels on the third night, no supply of hotel stationery on each of the three days at all (but I was generously given several sheets upon my request), a 45-minute wait for room service one night, etc. The room was kept very clean, however (but there was a funny chemical smell in the otherwise spotless 11th floor hallway throughout my stay). There were screaming ladies in the room next to me .... young ladies (teenagers?) ran out into the hallway, chasing each other and laughing uproariously even as they screamed (and banged their door twice). So much for soundproofing, but that was an isolated incident. (Not the only unusual event --- one breakfast diner at the coffee shop hurled a plate or bowl onto the ceiling, smashing it to pieces that rained down on the empty table next to mine. That's a first for me!) The breakfast hall is a classy, hushed place with subdued lighting (cozy atmosphere at 630 am). Food was quite good, but the selection was a bit disappointing (not enough Chinese food, with only two dimsum choices; no pancakes/waffles on two of the days I ate there.) The staff and the manager were efficient and very friendly. But eat early .... I saw a very long line of people waiting to enter the coffee shop at around 830 am, and there was quite a crowd inside. My biggest complaint: the SGD3 charge for bringing anything up to the room (even a simple bowl and spoon!). Enough for me to demote the hotel from 5-star to 4-star --- I encountered a similar charge only once before, in a 3-star hotel in Madrid, so it was a surprise to encounter such a charge in service-oriented Asia. I suggest that the management reconsider this unnecessary and customer-annoying practice. Oh, I did appreciate the efficiency of the staff in managing a very long queue for taxis on a busy, rainy morning ---- maybe 40 people ahead of me, but a rather quick wait that took less than 20 minutes. Well done. And the location, of course, is perfect. Less than a 10-minute walk to the Somerset MRT station through the discovery walk pathway ... smack in the middle of Orchard Road.", "Date": "March 27, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Halifax, Nova Scotia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "NatureHigh", "ReviewID": "UR101620966", "Content": "The hotel is rather expensive, but the location is very convenient.

We stayed at Meritus for 2 nights on our way back from Bintan Island. I have to say that I was a bit apprehensive after reading all the comments on the internet. We got there at 2h30 pm. Indeed, the check in process was quite long as the reception was absolutely packed with new guests arriving. After waiting for about 20 minutes, we were told that we had a room with 2 single beds. that was not what I had requested from my travelled agent. The lady said that if we wanted a king bed, we would have to wait 1 1/2 hour for a room, which we decided to wait for. Being on holidays, I didn't want to sleep in two single beds. At the time, I also requested a late check out and was told that we could keep the room until 2pm which was great for us as our flight was a late one. We went for a bite to eat and came back around 4pm and we were told that we had been upgraded to a room on the Executive level. When we saw our room, we were absolutely amazed! Wow what a beautiful, huge room. We couldn't have been more pleased. As I said, the room was stunning. It had a sofa, a massage chair, the bathroom was huge and beautiful. And, we had beautiful views of the city. Great service from the staff all the way. When we booked, we took breakfast with our package. We find it's always easier for us to have it included with our room, hence we don't have to race outside to find a place to have breakfast. Breakfast is very very very crowded. No matter what time you get there you have to line up to get seatted for breakfast. The buffet is huge, good variety. The only thing is that there's so many people that it can get a bit hard. There's no direction, therefore everyone walks everywhere and its a bit difficult as you get push around by people that obviously don't know how to behave in public. People are coming right in front of you and pushing and serving themselves, even if you were there before them. That would be my only complaint really about the hotel. Now, on the day we were leaving, I tentatively went to the receptioin to ask if we could keep the room a bit later than 2 pm since our flight was very late. To my surprise, I was told that with our room, we had a late checkout time of 4pm. Wow! what a treat! We really appreciated that. We will definitively stay at Meritus Mandarin again.

The double room is quite squeezy, considering that the voucher entitled me to an upgrade to a Premier room on the 16th floor on the new wing. There was nothing premier about it. Again, the decor for the room is posh. The view from my room is not fantastic. Though it faced Orchard Road, all I saw were other tall buildings. The swimming pool was small, too. And it was located at the lobby floor, with some glass panel and grills separating the two. Guests can look at the swimmers through the glass and grills. No staff was manning the towel desk at the pool at all. I just had to collect the towels myself. The dim sum restaurant at the highest floor was rumoured to be very good. S, I tried some dim sum there. It was very expensive, even though I have tasted better dim sum at cheaper prices elsewhere. Nothing to shout about. Overall, I will not stay here again.

But it is actually more like 4 star hotel w 2 star hotel staff attitude!!! Me and my family just comeback from spending 3 nights at Mandarin. I had some business to attend and my kids r on holiday so they came w us. 30 yrs ago mandarin was my second home whenever I was in Singapore, I wished to introduce it to my kids too.. but the management was soooo bad my kids said: mom.. I think the hotel not good, actually it's the worst hotel ever!! even the 3star hotel in small city of Indonesia serve their customer better. That is the view of 7 and 5 yrs old kids... To start: with people line up everyday for check in n check out on 2 lobby floor-1st n 5th floor, the hotel only manage to prepare 4 single chair n 2 table for it guests... later when we checked out and I told the manager he replied \"we had hundreds of rooms n it is impossible to provide sitting for al of the guest\" Wow.... what an answer... who asked for chairs for everyone?? a long nice bench will be more than enough instead of 4 single chairs!! n I believe that hundreds of other hotels that also has hundreds of rooms manage to provide better place to wait than this so called Meritus Mandarin hotel!! We got there at 11 something we had to wait for almost 1 hour standing w kids before we went up to our room that we found broken n can't opened. We had to go down again wait another hour to get inside a room that was so tiny.. the bed was really a single bed like 1x2m, w small bathroom. I called the receptionist and asked since I've been staying there soo many times over 30 years and this was the first time I saw they have that small room. The staff agreed to change my room to another tower with 2 conditions: 1> I can not change again, 2.I have to wait for another 3 hours for nonsmoking room as I reserved... I agreed and went downstair. The front desk staff actually was about to gave us the new key directly but then she checked with the inside staff and told us we had to wait 3 hours... I was going to explode w anger but it was already 2 o'clock, my kids had not had lunch so we just said ok n left for lunch. Now that I think about it, my reservation was originally for the main tower plus it was not our fault the first time we switched room.. the room door was broken!!!! to add it, the front office didn't even consider I may need bigger room eventhough I mentioned I need an extra bed!! Anyway, we went back around 5 and they finally gave us the new key.. we got up waiting for our bags which never come.. and the kids r so cranky already since they wanted to change their clothes.. they were up n on the road since 6 in the morning so my husband went down collected the bags himself. We were so tired we took a nap, when we got up I was about to gave my kids a bath when I saw the bathroom rug was stained... badly, smelly stained.. don't have the heart to spill it here what stain that was!! I just screamed on the phone and the superviser, Mr. Gunalan, came.. said sorry a couple time, changed the rug, gave me his card, asked me how many days I was going to stay... I answered, he said sorry again n that was it... to be honest I was hoping he asked how many days we were planning to stay to gave us an upgrade or some complimentary whatever.. but nooooo!!! that was the last time I heard from the management. To complete the nightmare, on our last night the electricity went out twice.. superb!!! not to long since I was up and called directly. the next day when we asked for late checked out they just said sorry can't do.. the hotel sooo fully booked!!!! we explained that we got our room around 6PM eventhough we came at 11 something and they still say sorry can't do.. Great!!! to top it out when we settle our bill we were charge breakfast for our first night.. gezzzz how can we had breakfast there when we got our room at 6PM??? Before I left the counter w so much anger the manager approached me, saying sorry n hope I will gave mandarin another opportunity to serve better. I said to him, well I am sorry too but I don't think I will ever comeback..

Good amenities. 4. Big bed. 5. Nice and spacious wardrobe. 6. Enough light during the day from the window. Cons: 1. Complicated check in process. I can imagine if I've many luggages and I've to be directed to the next level to do the necessary check in and then, take my stuff and go to my room. Going to the room can be complicated as well because they've so many \"wings\" and you might end up going to the wrong tower. 2. The pool is right beside the hotel's lobby. When I swim, I prefer it to be at a nice place with a good and quiet view. Not infront of the many people who walks in and out. 3. The mini-fridge in the room is hidden inside one of the small cupboard. Search for it. 4. The room is separated by a thin wall, I suppose and a connecting door to another room. I can hear the neighboring kids making so much noise even in the middle of the night! My partner and I couldn't get a good sleep at all because of all the baby cries and stuff coming from the next room. Remember also, whatever you say, they can hear you too. Totally no privacy. 5. Ordered room service at 9pm, food arrives at 10:30pm. Ordered a bowl of porridge and some meat sticks. The menu doesn't reflect a very high price, but when you order it, it's scarily expensive. Just the 2 food cost us up to $80! Other than that, the people forgot the pepper, salt, the requested fork and spoon. Felt that they weren't very conscientious about the patron's needs and feelings. 6. If you wake up early, and wish to find breakfast anywhere around your hotel, you'll only be stuck with MacDonald's down at Heeren because nothing is opened until 10:30 - 11:00AM. For the price I was paying, I believe I could get a much better hotel, at a much better location. I gave Mandarin Orchard a try because of it's location and I wanted to experience the plushness of living in a 5 star rated hotel. However, i was very disappointed. Things I hope they change: 1. Control of human traffic at the basement. (Shopping level). Although I understand that there's a shopping gallery connecting to the hotel, I feel that the hotel premise should only limit itself to the patrons and visitors and not any stranger(s). The place was filled with just people sitting around on the chairs and we, the real patrons, end up having to stand while waiting to be served. 2. Offer services to bring the patrons up to their room if their room is like way far away from the check in counter. It is terrible if you have to lug your luggage and desperately search for your tower. The staff who served us was pretty rush in telling us where to take the lift from (simply pointing from the counter where she was seated). She showed no sign of offering some help. Left right, left right, ... 3. Better sound proof rooms. 4. Better lit rooms. In the day time, the room's fine. During the night, there's hardly any good light that we can keep on to last the night except the bathroom's. 5. Better room service if you charge so high for service charges.

The club room rate included breakfast and free internet which the ordinary premier room did not, and if you added the cost of breakfast and daily internet to the premier room rate it worked out much the same as the club rate, so this is what I booked. The inclusive breakfast was taken in the club lounge which featured butler service as well as buffet.

I checked in early morning in the main lobby so no problems whatsoever. As a 'club' guest I was able to check-out in the club lounge - all fast and painless. Staff in the club lounge were efficient, friendly and attentive, and all staff including maids and bellboys said hello to you when passing, and in the club lounge staff addressed you by name. As has been said elsewhere, the beds were very comfortable and the rooms well appointed. The bathrooms were state of the art but the oppulence was let down by the cheap toilet paper provided. The paper was thin with no strength to it especially when in contact with anything moist! Worlds apart from the thick plush towels and bath mat. I raised this point with reception, and a day later their head of house keeping knocked at my door. She defended the choice of paper and would have me believe it was of high quality; she obviously didn't know the meaning of 'crap'! Never the less she said my 'complaint' would be brought up at the next management meeting. I sincerely hope they introduce stronger paper. Would I stay again? Yes. The club package offered good value over other nroom choices at this standard of hotel. That said, their internet rates were not cheap although you had the options of wifi or network cable connections both with reasonable speed.", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clonmel", "Title": "\u201cEmphasis is on business travellers\u201d", "Author": "LeVisitant", "ReviewID": "UR62955534", "Content": "Mixed experience at this hotel.

We always stayed there everytime we went to Singapore due to its central location on Orchard Road. The last time we stayed there in 2009, it was undergoing a major refurbishment and so both my husband and I were excited to go there to experience the \"new\" hotel this year. We were not disappointed. The rooms have gotten \"fresher\", the lobby more spacious and the restaurant has been turned into a very modern and classy venue with many seatings compared to the old one. My only comment on the room is that the lighting tends to be on the dim side for my liking. As most hotel service in Singapore, check-in and check-out was simple, fast and had no-frills. There were no personal touches but then again, since this is more of a busines hotel, for me personally it was proper and adequate. The hotel is now part of a new luxurious mall and it can be very confusing. I saw many tourists coming to the hotel getting very confused and during my morning walk bumped into a confused man with a huge luggage who couldn't find the entry to the hotel. So here's my tip and hopefully it can help if you're coming to the hotel. If you arrive by Taxi, it will drop you off on the lobby which is on the side part of the hotel. Now this is not the main lobby so you can leave your luggage here for the Concierge to bring it your room later or alternatively bring your own and head to the elevator. Tha main lobby is located on the 5th Floor and this is where the Reception area is. If you are coming by MRT, then you can head to the main entrance of the Mall, there is a Glass Door in the middle next to the branded / luxurious stores. Upon entrance, you will find a series of elevators and you can take it to the 5th Floor where again, you will find the main lobby. We will definitely stay here again and if you're coming to Singapore for a shopping spree the hotel is very convenient since you can always go back and drop your shopping bags before heading on to another shopping session.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Christchurch", "Title": "\u201cWorst Ever Check-in Experience\u201d", "Author": "Muggsy23", "ReviewID": "UR62113503", "Content": "We were forced to stay in Singapore two extra nights because of the Iceland volcano eruption.

It must be said that the staff were very pleasant and the room was great, but the 30 minutes we spent either waiting for or being catered to by the check-in staff was the most frustrating hotel experiences my wife and I have ever encountered. There were no queuing arrangements and hence it was a pot luck supermarket type situation that ended with me in one line and my wife in another in order to enhance our ability to be served. When we were finally served there was an incredible amount of detail required including the presentation of both our passports and an inordinate amount of key board operation to record the details. Their computer systems must be verging on useless. When we had finally managed this process we were told the room wasn't available for 2 hours; this was OK because were early, but the thought of having to re-queue again did not fill us with delight.

We stayed in the Meritus once before (about 4 years ago), choosing it for its location: exact middle of Orchard road, next door to Nee Ann City (Takashimaya and Kinokuniya). Irrespective of the price of the rooms, they are VERY, VERY SMALL with virtually no room for clothing storage. Also, the hotel seems kind of sterile! At that time I decided not to return. This time we had no choice. We booked last minute and there were few rooms available due to the Formula-1 events. We booked a Premier room with a view of Orchard road - though I have no idea what is so \"premier\" about it. It was pretty plain and SMALL. We booked directly with the hotel from their site. Rate was higher because we had the bad luck of stopping over during the Formula-1 weekend. Internet rate normally about US$240 but I paid $290 WITHOUT breakfast. Extra bed for daughter very overpriced at US$56. The hotel was nearly fully booked due to the racing events, weddings and conferences. While the staff were very friendly and made an effort to make you feel appreciated (a big feat considering they have 1200 rooms), we got the sense the staff were just trying to keep up with the volume of guests. Question: Why can't 5* hotels ever give you the right amount of towels? In my reservation form I clearly marked THREE people. There was only 1 set of towels!! This might seem like nit-picking, but we just came from a little hotel in Hanoi ($75 for a room twice the size of the Meritus) and they had THREE sets of towels and THREE slipper sets in the room waiting for us when we walked in!!!! The Meritus Manderin has the best location, but it is a very commercial hotel. I recommend it for a SHORT 2 or 3 night stay, spending all your time out on the town.

We checked trip advisor and the Mertius Mandarin seemed reasonable value and a good location for what we were planning. We used the hotel website to book and were impressed with the hotel photos. Our first problem occurred before we arrived. Despite being able to specify 3 adults per room on the online booking, the price we booked did not take this into account. After making the booking we were informed of the extra charge for the third bed. This was frustrating after spending so long choosing a hotel only to find the rate we were quoted for our three bed room was incorrect. Due to lack to time to plan anything else we agreed to pay the extra charge. Unfortunately when we arrived at the hotel we did not see anything which resembled the photos we'd seen on the hotel website, and the hotel was actually under construction. This was not mentioned when we made the booking online. We arrived early and so checked in but without our room being ready, left our bags at reception and began shopping. After spending many hours (easily done) shopping on Orchard Rd we returned to the hotel many hours after we could have got the keys to our room. Back in reception, considering we'd already checked in, it took a long time to get the keys to our room. Frustration increased when once in our room we found only two beds!! A call to housekeeping and this was fixed but not something we expected to have to do. The main problem I had with this hotel was the construction work outside, overhanging the pavement. There were guys welding and banging tools about 20m above the pavement. This was an obvious health and safety issue. The construction work also meant the only entry and exit to the hotel was through the car drop off point where taxis, mini-coaches and cars were moving constantly. There was no pedestrian path, only the driveway which we had to share with the traffic. I was very unimpressed with this, and not something I'd want to have to negotiate with a push chair or small children.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manila, Philippines", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location, wonderful stay\u201d", "Author": "jatv", "ReviewID": "UR39289666", "Content": "During this trip with my wife and 8 year old son we decided to book a hotel in Orchard Road and we enjoyed every bit of our stay.

Our destination was 3-5 minutes from the hotel but the cab brought us around and around so we ended up paying more than we should have.) The rooms are very spacious. We booked a deluxe room through our travel agent. We had a 1yr 8mo baby with us and there was enough room for a crib, our 2 luggages and space for our baby to run around. There were 2 sinks, a bathtub - it was a spacious bathroom. Lights were controlled digitally with the press of a button. There were blackout curtains to block out the sunlight.

If you mind the additional SD15 per dish, order it from the room and then go pick it up yourself and you can eat it in the room. They provide disposable tupperware and utensils.)

The experience at this hotel was very disappointing as I was expecting, the least, an average business hotel. Btw, the Meritus was going through renovation when I stayed there. The room - standard deluxe. I was upgraded - which was a pleasant surprise, but and I wonder what the experience would've been if not... Room view gave to the roof of another building, with the air filtering system above my view, and ears. I was aware that being in the middle of Orchard Rd wouldn't guarantee perfect silence... or maybe I'm too sensitive to noise. Room size itself was quite big. You can see the furniture and room is a bit dated though. Bathroom decent sized with bath. Found a hair in the tub and there were ponctual waves of a sewage smell coming from the water bassin I think... Bed was basic. Comfortable, duvet a bit too thin. I also wondered about the grills on the ceiling in the room and bathroom... ventilation? They weren't closed properly so called room service which was quite quick to act. Breakfast is a complete joke. My fault because I chose to pay for it, but at around 28 S$ I was expecting more than white loaf bread (the sweet square ones), fried dumplings and co, NO fresh juices, a tiny egg station with noone actually there to prepare the eggs, and... the weird sensation you have when you come in a gigantic ballroom and see a little U shaped table with the buffet. Sure, you have female staff members standing in front of the main entrance in traditional red chongseams. But half of the time they are talking to collegues or ignoring you. To finish with a positive point, the location is great if you want to indulge in shopping or having amneties close to you. I spent hours at the Starbucks in the shopping mall facing the hotel, using free internet. For the moment, at the price the rooms go at the Meritus, you can definitely find something else better in Singapore, around Bugis, Marina, etc. Except if you're dead set on staying at Orchard.

I was very concerned about the level of noise as I knew that reconstruction was taking place. However I called the hotel before my journey to request a room on a higher floor so I'm not disturbed - and thats what I got (a room on the 32nd floor in the Main tower) and during my whole 8 day stay I didnt hear a peep of noise. Location: Excellent for a first time tourist to Singapore in the heart of Orchard Rd. The shoppers paradise. Taxi drivers never had a problem finding this hotel. Apart from shopping you can find Western fast food chains like Mcdonalds, Subway and other outlets, Currency Converters, Post office, Fresh fruit juice bars, cinema, bars, Orchard Rd MRT station etc. Check In: Very Smooth, didn't have to queue up. I arrived at 9am and requested an early check in. The lady at the desk was very polite and checked us in immediately at no extra charge. Another lady escorted us to our room. The porter brought our luggage with us in the same lift (as I had said that I need my bags immediatly) which was good. In the room, the lady took my credit card details as a gaurantee and saw our passports. Room: A good sized room with twin beds (as requested). The room had a very effective Air-con system and a iron board + iron . A kettle and stuff to make tea was in the room and was complimentary. The room was very clean and was serviced daily. Bathroom was a good size, fluffy towels, two sinks(?) and a bathtub with a shower. Breakfast: OK I can see some problems. The breakfast rooms got a bit too busy at times - however we never had to wait more than a few minutes for a table. They offered a continental breakfast choice: fresh fruits, crossaints/pastries, breads, beans, sausages, bacon (a bit too crispy for my liking), potatoe wedges, yoghurts and cereals. Omelletes could be ordered from the omellete bar, this could take very long as there was only 1 man with one stove! Local b/f choices were also available which I didnt try. On the whole I don't think one could go hungry. I noticed other reviewers complaining about inefficient staff, I didnt encounter this and thought all staff at b/f were very polite and efficient. Checkout: PROBLEM, two days before check out I called reception and asked what my TOTAL bill will be provided I don't use the minibar/telephone etc. I was given a figure and so I changed the appropriate amount of foreign currency so that I'm not delayed on the day of checkout. So the night before checkout, I go to settle the bill and guess what, the figure quoted is nearly SIN300 higher than before. I told the lady that I was given a different figure and she said that was only till the day I called!! Even though I made it very clear to the man on the fone! So I had to go out again and change more money - very inconvenient! On the whole a good a would reccommend this hotel to someone visiting Singapore.

To compensate we were charged a very competitive room rate through Latestays which we feel more than made up for the inconvenience. Once through the noise and chaos of the lobby and lift area and in your room, you are not troubled at all by what is going on below. The room itself, although a little dated was clean, spacious, airy and bed comfortable. Bathroom had a bath and separate 'spa' type shower. The room was serviced twice daily - that is, bed made/turned down, towels changed, bathroom cleaned tea/coffee and water replenished etc. We found the room a little dark, as the net curtain at the window could not be pulled back and the lighting was not really very bright. Breakfast in the Chatterbox restaurant on the top floor was a bit crazy, staff appeared disorganized and somewhat untrained. Sometimes the teapot arrived with one tea bag, other times with three! The buffet is scattered in a complete circle which no-one really explains and because you can only see a small part of it you may be unaware that it continues right around. Quite frankly we found the breakfast buffet a little boring, especially if you do not eat the asian cuisine. It would have been nice to have some grilled tomatoes or mushrooms, instead of the stock standard baked beans, bacon (which was always cooked to a crisp) and egg. One morning the Chatterbox was so full for breakfast we were sent on a journey to the other tower. We ended up in the ballroom, where another buffet breakfast is served. This time the teapot arrived with no tea bag in it at all! Yes, it had tea of a decent strength but unfortunately stone cold! We pointed this out to the staff only to get another one of the same temperature. So no tea that morning and to top it off no marmalade for the toast - we asked but were told there was none. The staff didn't really go out of their way to please which is unfortunate. Then as we were leaving my husband observed the staff pouring back the unused tea from the teapots removed from the tables back into a big ern. He carefully checked and noticed it was not plugged in or heated in anyway! And yes, you guessed it he then witnessed them pouring 'fresh' teapots straight from this big ern. This explained the cold cups of tea - actually recycled from other teapots! I would have expected much better from a hotel of this calibre in central Orchard Rd. Check out did not go that smoothly either, after getting the bill, it came to $20 sgd more that our Latestays voucher said (and we had no other charges apart from the room) we queried it but the reception staff were unable to explain the discrepancy. Since we needed to leave for the airport we simply paid it and left.

On their proposal to accept a smoking room to have a king size bed, I accepted as in my experience, smoking floors in most good hotels have no appreciable smell. Bad decision - I was wrong.

To my disappointment, I quickly found two long female hairs in the bathroom (the cleaner\u2019s, I guess). My first breakfast at the Mandarin Ballroom was just barely ok, with unattentive service by distracted waiters. Large choice but amazingly no jam/marmalade anywhere unless you asked, and if you do so they bring you one small jar only\u2026 For the first time in my life, I reported my early disappointing experiences to the manager on the feedback form three nights before leaving. On day 3 I even had to give up breakfast: a long queue for seating was being handled by just one poor lady, left alone by a number of lazy staff. After a ten minute wait and recognizing I would not have made it in time, I gave up but did contact the manager on duty to complain and at least recoup the breakfast share of my room rate. Later on that day I received an email with apologies from the hotel manager who offered my to exchange my room (too late) and to be a guest at the executive clubroom for drinks and breakfast on the final morning (I accepted the latter). This was one of the few professional gestures I observed during my stay. Well, there may have been other satisfactory moments and aspects, but at the Meritus Mandarin due to my experience and expectations, I expected a flawless Asian experience. There's lots of renovation going on, with consequences such as main lobby not in use, gym temporarily set up in conference rooms, and pool not available, but this is short term and more understandable. This time overall the Meritus looked more like a tourist class hotel, despite its ambition to be much more than that.

This trip, I booked taking advantage of the Singapore Airlines Stop over package of which I must say, as a frequent traveller to Singapore, I wonder why I have not done that before. You can book via the Singapore Airlines website, pre pay and take advantage of some very good rates. It includes a free airport transfer, discounts on food and beverage in the hotel where you are staying and discounts on local attractions. Great value for money and I will do that again in the future. Back to the hotel review, the Meritus is going through a renovation of the public areas on the Orchard Road side but I must say, management is trying to keep the inconvenience to the minimum. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is great, right on Orchard Road, with plentiful access to public transport and of course the shopping district. The pool is closed due to renovations but shuttles are provided to the Marina Bay Mandarin where the pool can be used. I had lunch at the Pine Court Chinese restaurant which has some fantastic dishes, I really enjoyed that. Breakfast is served at the restaurant on the top floor which has great views of Singapore. The quality of the buffet was a bit disappointing and needs to be looked at as it is a bit of a let down. I choose, despite the Singapore Stop Over 50% discount to have breakfast in town.

I beg to differ. It is, at most, a 4-star hotel rather than the 5-star it claims. While the lobby may be termed \"grand\" it isn't awe inspiring. (I do have to remark, however, that the hotel staff manning the floor from any number of nationalities - Sing-Chinese, to Indian, to Filipino, to European - does imbibe the hotel with an international feel, even if the hotel seems to be patronized by mainland Chinese tourists more than any other nationality.) The standard rooms are spacious, clean and well decorated. The bathrooms are nice. The double sinks will undoubtedly delight couples and people sharing a room. That having been said, the faux wood grain \"wallpaper\" used to paper the cabinets are unworthy of a true 5-star hotel. The fact that the hotel is huge and housed in two architecturally non-descript towers, thereby leading to a degree of impersonality, detracts further from any claim to true 5-star status. Chatterbox claims to be the home of Hainese Chicken Rice. Maybe. But here's an open secret - you can get chicken rice that's just as good, if not better, that costs much less at other places in Singapore. (Be warned, however, that if you want ambience along with your chicken rice, you're not likely to get it from these other places.) What's the best thing about the Meritus? Location.

I tell you, you'll never go hungry in that hotel because they also have the Chatterbox Coffeehouse which is open 24hrs. (i think..) I sampled their famous mandarin chicken and it was really tasty and very tender. The location is perfect for first time travellers in Singapore (like me!). The hotel is right in the heart of Orchard Road where all the major shops are! Esprit for example, is right beside the hotel. Starbucks and HSBC bank right across the road. The hotel is literally surrounded by shopping malls, which some of them are open until 2am! which you never see in London! Imagine, starbucks open for 24hrs! (haven!). The nearest MRT station is Somerset, a few steps away from the hotel so you can travel to anyplace you want anytime, although getting a cab won't cost you much anyway if you want to save your energy and go straight to where you want to go. I found that streets in Singapore are very safe even at night. We were out every night, until 3am without any worries. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Meritus Mandarin Hotel in Singapore.

The location however is definitely 5 star as it is right smack in the middle of Orchard Road and next to Ngee Ann City Mall and near two MTR stations (Orchard and Somerset). Breakfast was average, not much to choose from. Since there were a lot of people staying at the hotel, you had to take breakfast early otherwise it will be difficult to find a table.

I brought along my wife because it was our 20th wedding anniversary and I thought that this would be a nice present for her since the shopping malls are very accessible from this hotel. She can go shopping while I had to do my thing for my client. I'm so glad I chose this hotel. Upon check-in (we pre-paid for a deluxe room at the Grand Tower mainly because of the reviews from this site) we were told that our room was not yet ready. We arrived there at around 1:00 pm. I inquired from the receptionist around what time the room would be available. She replied that the room MAYBE available at around 4:00 pm. I asked her why she wasn't sure about the time. She did not respond and was just looking at the computer monitor. I was slightly irritated by her non-response since I knew that I had a 5:00 pm meeting with my client that afternoon and I had to ensure that I would be able to change to my business attire. After a few minutes of looking at her computer monitor she offered us an upgrade to their Premier room for an additional $100.00 for our entire stay. I declined the offer. After again looking at her computer monitor for another minute or so, I politely told the receptionist that it was our 20th wedding anniversary and to please give us a nice room so that it would be a memorable experience for my wife. At this point, we were very surprised and happy when she informed us that she would upgrade us to their Premier room for free since it was our 20th wedding anniversary.!!!! Gosh!!! The room was very big and exquisite. It was on a high floor (rm 2808) and facing Orchard road. My wife and I really loved the asian theme. My wife and I don't normally take pictures of our hotel rooms but this was something special that we thought we could share in this website. I will not give a lengthy description of the room but instead attach some of the pictures we took of the room to give justice to the room( i.e., in case I fail to adequately describe the room here, hehehe). As you can see from the pictures, the room was absolutely perfect. No complaints about the room. Of course, I have to admit that the previous posts about Chaterbox were accurate.

The room had a slightly worn feeling to it and there was a connecting door to another room - we noticed that our neighbours like to watch TV late at night. The charge for breakfast and for an additional bed in the room was simply outrageous. Especially given the very mediocre quality of the food in the Chatterbox. The Chatterbox boast and industrial strength air conditioner combined with an interior design of '1970s meets McDonalds': red transparent plastic panels of the cheaper kind - definitely not what you would expect in a good hotel. Staff in the Chatterbox seemed to be untrained and unrefined. Even the initial coffee often requied a special request and refills were definitely not automatic. The buffet was very poor in size and quality. The swimming pool was definitely quite different from the pictures shown in some of the more positive reviews on this page, where it is usually shown from the most advantageous angle (which makes me quite suspicious of some of these reviews). It was mostly deserted, with neither guard nor any other attendant available, definitely not a place for poolside cocktails (at least none were on offer when we were there).
