This hotel was in such disrepair that it is incredible that they are allowed to stay open. We were kept up most of the night by arguing drunk people in the next room. The AC was inadequate and unable to be adjusted cooler or warmer, the elevator made so much noise we feared it would break down. The parking lot was so broken down that you bottomed out entering and exiting. I was looking for a basic place to lay our heads as we came in late and were leaving early, and didn't even get that. We wondered how clean the linens were based on the rest of the surroundings. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone and especially anyone with a family. We did not feel safe at all.

But we got the impression that they were extremely over-worked & the very nice man in charge of the lobby didn't even have time off to eat or a place to eat in - he had a folding table & ate hastily in a corner of the lobby, continuing to serve customers whilst he tried to get a meal in - he was still working 10 (?) hours later & was still the only one in the lobby.* The room looked good from a housekeeping point of view but it lacked supplies - no bath mat & very limited towels. Half the drawers in the place were fake & there were no facilities in the room for making anything, not even a cup of tea. Nor was there any such in the lounge or lobby - nor was there a breakfast room - no breakfast of any description, not even an urn of hot water for tea or coffee at any time. We were told we could go to the gas station next door for a cup of coffee (we wanted just hot water for tea) We had been warned by previous reviews that parking was very limited & had even read the hotel's response that their parking issues were resolved. They were not - we were directed to park in front of the restaurant next door & we saw later that others were double-parked on the hotel's forecourt. I do not know how those behind could get out if the ones parked on the outside didn't move first. They said the hotel's car park was \"under repairs\" but, in that case that's been so for many months, & it is a good-sized hotel so, very inadequate space. The housekeeping staff were not noisy but the walls were so thin you could not help hearing the noises they made whilst cleaning. It was not their fault! The place was very noisy & someone started drilling first thing the morning of our departure. In the lobby at night, there were several people hanging around &, judging by their dress & behaviour, they were prostitutes & either their johns or their pimps (& one small boy amusing himself hopping up & down around the lobby floor, poor child) We overheard one man trying to rent a room for an hour. Credit to the hotel - he was made to pay for the whole night. There was also a very competent-looking & pleasant security guard there* who kept an eye on everyone so I could be wrong about the people - but I would not recommend this hotel to anyone with a family - I'm not sure I would recommend it to anyone!

Friday night was quiet, but Saturday, there was like 7 parties going on downstairs and I had to park on the street and could hear music till past 3 am. In 3 days, I never saw another white person in the hotel besides myself. None of this bothered me, I just thought it was funny. I wasn't expecting much for $100, and didn't get much. The only thing that made me mad was when I checked out, some fool had blocked my car in, and locked his keys in the car. I had to wait over an hour until he jimmied the door. Staff at the hotel offered no help at all.", "Date": "June 24, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cWould not go back\u201d", "Author": "tammicpr", "ReviewID": "UR15267717", "Content": "There was no hot water, toilets did not flush, shower took long to drain.

We wound up parking across the street in a shopping mall lot (probably illegally). The motel houses a party center as well, resulting in a very noisy environment and a rowdy clientele. The doors provide very little security, the bedding consisted of only a sheet and bedspread, there were no face towels or shampoo and no housekeeping service.

I'm not disputing what the previous poster said about thin walls and noise----I suspect the place was quiet because there were almost no other guests on the premises when I was there. (I stayed there on a Sunday night, in case you're considering it.) In light of the fact that I spent almost twice as much at the Holiday Inn just down the street on the previous night, and it was noisy, I think this place was a bargain on that score. On the other hand, I didn't think my room was very clean. In fact, it was probably near the lower limit of my standards. (Maybe it was all the cigarette burns in the carpet and furniture that turned me off.) There is one other thing---I'm kind of reluctant to mention it: almost everybody I saw in the motel was black, and I got the feeling my presence was, well, disapproved of. (I happen to be white.) No one did or said anything overt. It was just that, for example, if I greeted someone, they wouldn't reply. Or I noticed people frowning when they looked at me. Subtle signals like that. I'm not saying I felt unsafe or anything, just unwelcome.

I will say right off the bat that everything was clean but that's where the compliments stop. The walls are paper thin, they don't have the best \"clientel\" and it's extremely noisy (and the fact that it's above a banquet hall and next to a gas station does not help). Also, the only lock on the room door was a push knob lock. We slept with a chair pushed against the door and hid our valuables while we were out. Happy to report nothing was stolen, but still not a very safe feeling. Unless you are truly stuck with needing a place to stay (like we were) I don't suggest staying here.
