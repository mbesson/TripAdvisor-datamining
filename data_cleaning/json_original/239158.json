This was one of the cheapest hotels in Barcelona with this good location. Hotel itself is small and quite old, but if you are just looking for a place to sleep, it's perfectly fine. Room is roomy enough and bathroom was nice and big. We had some problems with the room though: walls are thin and you can hear everything your neighbors say. There's some water pipes inside the walls and they make a lot of noise, not a nice thing especially in the middle of the night! Another warning: If your room mate leaves the room and you lie in bed not moving, electricity shuts down automatically. This happened to us when my boyfriend went outside for smoking and I stayed in our room alone. I was lying in bed and watching tv, not moving a lot, and suddenly the lights went off and tv shut down itself. The whole room was dark, it was quite scary... When I stood up, electricity came back on. There's a small motion detector on the wall which turns power back on, and there's some sort of automatic power switcher that turns the electricity off when you leave the room... Location is good, although the neighborhood is little bit restless. Not a long walking distance to the nearest metro station. Nice cafe opposite the hotel, much better breakfast there than in the hotel. Staff is nice, but all of them don't speak English very well, could be a problem if you don't speak Spanish...

We will never forget our horrible experience... we booked online, when we showed up the room wasn't ready, they told us the cost of the room would be more than what we agreed to online, and the wifi wasn't working. When we finally got to our room, it was nasty and we were supposed to stay at the hotel for 4 days. The first 2 days we didn't have any hot water, not even warm. We complained to the staff who said they would not move us to a new room AND we would have to wait a day for the maintenance person to come fix the problem. We asked to be compensated since we could not take showers nor could we cancel the reservation since it was made online. The staff was horrible, they refused to let us speak to a manager saying, \"No one is allowed to talk to the manager.\" They would call him on the phone while we stood there in front of them. It was humiliating. One night, a few guys got stuck on the elevator, which was jerking up and down with the doors partially opened, and they were screaming for help (it was over 100 degrees in the elevator, in the middle of summer). My friend and I frantically ran down the many flights of stairs to the front desk to get help. The staff stared blankly at us and could care less!!!!! Finally, a staff member got the guys out, but it was all very scary. Later, the guys told us lots of things were stolen from their room. We were so disgusted with everything at Hotel Ronda, we left a day early to relocate at a new hotel, losing over 200 Euros for leaving a day early. We were told be locals that this place is run by the mafia. I wouldn't be surprised if it was, as I have never experienced such disgraceful customer service in my life.

I can\u00b4t understand what others expect from a 3 star hotel, because some visitors wrote bad critics of this hotel. Perhaps they had another room or they expect more than the price could offer. The hotel is situated near the center, 10 minutes to walk to the ramblas, 3 minutes go walk to the next metro station, surrounded by coffe shops. What else do you need for visiting a city? The reception was opened for 24 hours, very helpfull and friendly of corse english speaking. I booked by one RatesToGo.com but it would be a little cheaper to book it directly. They have rooms with double bed and french beds. Just tell them, what you prefer. If you book by RatesToGo, your credit card is only charged for about 20% of the rate. If you book directly it would be charged for the full rate. When you arrive you have to pay for the whole. I payed \u20ac 56 for a double per day without breakfast. The breakfast is a buffet for about \u20ac 10. I didn\u00b4t need it, because dinnertime in spain starts after 9 pm. What to do with a buffet in the morning? Allthough it looked good. my room? I had everything I needed. Two clean beds, safe to rent, Tv with international channels (in german only 3 sat) clean bathroom with toilet, bidet and bathtube. Every day fresh towels. Hairdryer - soap and shampoo renewed every day. At our arrival, a lamp was not working, but it was renewed after some minutes. I had a room looking not to the street. Perhaps this is the reason why we didn\u00b4t have any noise of the street. Somethimes I heared the elevator, when the wondow was opened.

Firstly they have parking, at the cost of 18 euros a night, which for the city centre isn't bad, but we parked our bike around the corner, in a little plaza, which was perfectly safe and not tampered with. The room was very clean and quite quirky - with a slightly slanted ceiling. The twin beds were large ( we tend to usually go for twin beds now as doubles in hotels are sometimes really small!). The bath was the small spanish variety, but a little hard to get into if you have problems stepping in and out as it backed onto the toilet - but I expect they would have let us change rooms if this had been an issue. The area itself wasn't the best in the world, but I did know this when I booked it. But it is only a 5 minute walk to the Ramblas, and if you go straight across to it, rathe than down and aross then you avoid the smellier areas - only one street we went down smelt like a toilet.

Seeing as there was no such thing as a free meal, I was expecting a dirty hell hole and very rude staff and can happily report I was proven wrong. The staff was curteous and gave us maps of the area upon check in. We took the stairs to room 110 and found it to have adequate space and was spotlessly clean. Toiletries, fluffy towels (changed every day), even combs were provided. If you want extra, such as the safe or a remote control for the tv, these can be hired. The airconditioning worked well and the beds were fine. You could hear the toilet being flushed in the room above, but only in the bathroom and we had some noisy Czechs in the room adjacent to us so this hotel, as any others can be noisy at times. Bring earplugs or sleeping pills if this bothers you. As noted in other reviews, the hotel is very well placed. Head up the road to Universitat, a short stroll with many good places to eat, a bit further in the same direction is Eixample, the gay district. To the east is La Rambla, you come emerge onto it about a third the way down which is fine. For those that are planning their first trip, try getting the train from the airport rather than a taxi. At the airport buy from the ticket machines a \"T10\" for zone 1 costing approx \u20ac7 (this is pretty much all of Barcelona that you would possibly need!) the T10 is a carnet of 10 single trips which can be used on the trains, metro, buses. Get on either train departing from the airport - they both go to the center. Change at Passeig de Gracia, a stop after Sants, and hop onto the metro to Sant Antoni stop. You will then be about a 4 minute walk from the hotel and the entire journey would have cost you about \u20ac1.40. Bargain!

The carpet was badly stained and ripped up in places and don't even get me started on the bathroom.....absolutely disgusting. The window in the bedroom overlooked what I suppose was some kind of courtyard, but it can't have been more that 15 square foot and every side was surrounded by rooms. So basically straight outside your window were more rooms, above, below, left, right, overlooking, you name it. Now I can slum it when I have to, but what really made this place so vile, was the noise. Full blown shouting, people running up and down the corridoors screaming, all night, every night, till 3 in the morning is not nice for anyone. Sleeping was limited to 4 or 5 hours a night and you were always on edge that someone was going to come bursting through your door.

The cold buffet breakfast was OK and plentiful \u2013 some patrons even made their own packed lunch from it. Unfortunately the Hotel is old, our first room ( a triple) was tiny and very basic. We did ask if there was another room available and got the 7th floor which meant getting the lift to the 6th floor and walking the final floor! This room had only ONE chair (remember it is a triple room), and hardly any wardrobe space and paper thin walls. The sound of our neighbours arguing on return from their night out was the early alarm clock. The tiny window (see picture) was obscured by a heating duct and the view out is well \u2013 of roof tops and aerials \u2013 truly a single star feature. Outside \u2018ladies\u2019 were selling their wares on the streets during the day and night. Harmless enough but the sheer amount of dog dirt on the pavements was truly off putting for an evening stroll. Positive points were 2 minutes to University and 10 minutes from Las Ramblas. As a seasoned traveller I would rate this amongst the worst hotels I\u2019ve stayed.

Yet upon arriving at the hotel, I found it not at all as bad as previous reviews suggested. I personally found the Ronda to be a well-situated hotel (just 10 mins walk to Placa Catalunya & the Ramblas), with friendly staff & service. The breakfast was ok, neither me or my boyfriend had any complaints about it. As for the \"noise\", the only night that there was some noise was on the second night when some loud Italians were shouting quite a bit at around 3am, but at the end of the day people are on holiday and are only having a good time! i'm sure when me & my boyfriend came home drunk on the first night we were probably noisy, too. if people are offended by noise then perhaps they shouldn't stay in a hotel in the middle of a huge and lively city like Barcelona... Overall, the Ronda was a clean, well-situated hotel that wasn't as noisy or as terrible as reviewers of this hotel claim. The beds were fine, the rooms were clean & I seriously don't understand why people have complained about the Ronda so much. I thouroughly enjoyed my stay there & my boyfriend & I are already planning a return trip to Barcelona and the Ronda!
