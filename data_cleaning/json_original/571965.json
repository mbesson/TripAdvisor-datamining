I have been to Venice many times before,I had initally booked for four of us but two others joined us and to get a rely from Mateo for another room was impossible! I resorted to snail mail with a stamp and that awoke him! When we arrived we found that two of us had to share a double bed! The beds were all very uncomfortable, but we managed. Towels were an issue, the toga type that blot you dry and if you wanted to have a clean one you had to pay! The breakfast was simple, good coffee but you cannot expect wonders for the price we paid. Venice is getting very very expensive so you have to take that into account. The great moment for me was when we were given a front door key to our own front door in the most beautiful city in the world! The position of this B&B is super just two minutes from Ca'Rezzonico wonderful! Please go and enjoy this B&B Mateo is very welcoming but remember this is a B&B do not expect five star treatment.

Had to close window shutters due to mosquitoes and run AC, which was really only a fan. Caretaker removed air conditioning controls - had to demand to get back. Location on quiet canal was good.

We couldn't fault the accommodation or the beds! - we had 3 rooms between us - some rooms were a bit nicer and a bit bigger than others (didn't for one moment expect a view at this price) - the bathrooms were all nice and fairly recently renovated.

Though a bit spartan, the location and price seemed good, so when we decided to return for Carnevale we booked them again. From the outset there were some difficulties-- you can only make the reservation by phone, so this required an expensive call to Italy, and after I made the reservation I was warned that I would have to pay the bill (over 1000 Euros-- it was a long stay) in cash. I am not comfortable carrying 1000 Euros in cash, but I was willing to do it. I did notice that a more recent review said that Ca'Turelli did not honor his reservation, but I thought that since I had stayed here before it would be fine. Nevertheless, I was uneasy. The owner asked me to let him know what time of day I would be arriving a few days beforehand, since he is not there all the time. So, four days before my arrival I send him my flight information. At that point he writes back to say he has lost my reservation due to his computer failing at the end of 2009 and there is no longer availability for my dates. He does offer to put me up in an apartment, in a different section of the city, without breakfast, without photos of where I would be staying, for the same price. I looked to see what else was available and found, to my surprise, that four days before arriving in Venice for a major festival I could get a room at a four star hotel for a much cheaper price. That is what I did. Sure, things happen. But why didn't he have a backup of his reservations, presumably some of his most crucial business information? And of the small number of reviews of Ca'turelli I am now the _second_ person not to have his reservation honored. It seems like a pattern. I think I got lucky the first time I stayed here and unlucky the second time.

It never disappeared the whole four nights we were there. Although the room was large, the bed was very hard and under the bed was much dust and debris. The furniture was more junk, than antique. The bathroom was the only good thing, although the body gel/shampoo was never replace the whole time we were there. Breakfast was a huge disappointment with small stale rolls, corn flakes and a wrapped, small apricot tart, not the abundant buffet that is advertised. The juice seemed like Kool-Aid. We paid 110 Euro in October. We tried to communicate with the woman who sat and watched us eat each morning, but were unsuccessful with our three language capability. It would have been nice if the owner had shown up in the mornings to greet his guests but we never saw Matteo. The hotel website does not convey the reality of the place, even thought it supposedly was just renovated. It seems with a little extra effort it could be a great place to stay. There are only about 3 or 4 rooms. Get rid of the odor, pay a bit more attention to cleaning and try for fresh rolls and perhaps a greater variety at breakfast.

When we arrived to the place, we were welcomed very warmly and shown to a beatiful, spacious, romantic and air conditioned room with a new, clean, spacious bathroom and a shower big enough to fit two. The neighborhood was not a touristy area and was in my opinion the loveliest neighborhood that I saw in Venice, with small canals and pretty little bridges in every direction. You will have to figure out the first time how to navigate your way (in the direction of the Accademia) to the wooden bridge across the Grand Canal to San Marco if you plan to walk to the tourist sites (which we did) or you can just walk a straightforward walk of about 3 blocks to the vaporetto (water buses). We walked from the hotel to Piazza San Marco, the Rialto bridge, etc and though it was by no means a short walk, it was certainly not as long as it looked on the map. Breakfast was a bit disappointing, just cereal and bread and jam and coffee/tea. But I understand this is typical of the region. In any case, definitely recommended.

This is a fantastic, family-run place off a little canal in Dorsoduro. It's the best of both worlds: you're away from the tourist hordes and still within moderate walking distance of everything. The express #82 vaporetto from the train station leaves you off just a short walk away (Zattere), which is key when you have luggage. Several good restaurants are located within a short distance. The Accademia Bridge is about a seven minute walk, and it's another 10-15 minutes from there to P. San Marco. The rooms and bathrooms are conspicuously large for Venice (for Italy, in fact), cooled by air-conditioning, well-appointed, and absolutely silent at night. The staff was friendly and very competent. The hotel offers free high-speed Internet access in the breakfast room. Breakfast is decent and continental. This isn't the Gritti, but it's extremely good value for the price.
