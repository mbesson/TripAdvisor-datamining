Well equipped kitchen. Marlin cheated me out of over 150 pounds. I booked a stay for 6 days, Sunday through Friday. My plans changed and on Tuesday I telephoned the front desk and said I needed to change my check out date to Friday. The clerk said \"We have a 72 hour policy, it's Tuesday, so you're within the deadline. I'll take care of it.\" The next day I got an email from Martin saying they I needed to submit any changes in WRITING, and since I hadn't written, and it was Wednesday, I had missed the deadline. I lost 150 pounds (plus taxes) for a night of lodging I didn't use, even though I notified them and was told by their own representative it was handled. If their agent had said \"Please email us\" I would have emailed. But he said \"I'll take care of it.\" I read the contract after receiving the email, and it's true it says that notice must be in writing. However, if you called and were told \"I'll take care of it\" you wouldn't pull out the contract (and a magnifying glass) to verify the terms. They know their own agent took my information and said he handled my request. Yet they used a technicality to basically screw me out of 150 pounds.

We actually at no 9 Byng Road and we rented a two bedroom apartment with two bathrooms advertised as ideal for 2-4 persons. The initial booking was made on-line and the process was simple. We did make enquiries as to whether we could have an extra bed (so everyone could have their own bed rather than a couple of us doubling-up), but were quite astrounded that this would be charged at \u00a337 per night - so doubling up it was! The instructions received by email for the check-in process were clear and the directions were good, had it not been for the roadworks at the roundabout where we were instructed to go straight across. When we stayed there were barriers up which force pedestrians down the first exit, Marsh Lane, rather than allow you access to the 2nd, Westferry Road. However we found during the course of the weekend, you can cut through the City Pride Pub car park which allows you to get from Marsh Lane to Westferry Lane without any fuss. It is a good 10 minute walk from CW Tube to Byng Lane. We arrived at the apartment at 6:30 on the Friday and the check-in process was simple and efficient; the concierge was extremely pleasant. We were on the third floor at the front of the building; the building is served by one lift which will accomodate 4 people and luggage (we were 3 and had space to spare!). The apartment itself was spacious and well equipped, with two well sized double bedrooms which had plenty of hanging and drawer space. However, we did have one observation, that as it is marketed as suitable for 2-4 people, there is only sufficient seating for 3 people on what I'd call comfy seating (sofa). There is a table and four chairs, but personally I feel it would have benefitted from having a bigger sofa. Also whilst advertised as a serviced apartment, in the general instructions it was stated that the occupants had to empty the rubbish bins - which seemed to be a contradication. We did as we were asked as we didn't want to risk the \u00a3200 credit card swipe we had to provide as part of the check-in process. Not really a big deal but something that kind of irked us! One thing we would draw people's attention to is that as we had a room at the front and it was quite warm, we had the windows open overnight and it was very noisy intermitently between 1am and 2:30am outside in the street (Marlin is opposite a low-rise residental block of flats) with people returning home from a night out. Whilst I can't comment what the noise level is like at the rear of the building, I suspect it wouldn't be any worse than the front, so might be worth asking for a room at the rear of the building to try and minimise any intrusion from outside noise. All in all, a good base for the weekend, easy access to CW tube, the DLR and the Thames Clipper. We did get a taxi back on the Saturday night as we didn't fancy the walk from the tube after a night out and it was about \u00a320 from the Embankment area.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cOvercharged and unfriendly staff\u201d", "Author": "Kovan888", "ReviewID": "UR123838939", "Content": "We stayed for 3 nights at Marlin Apartrments Canary South in Dec 2012.. The apartment is clean and has quite a nice and comfortable interior. I like the complete cooking facility and spaciousness of the apartment. However it is not easy to locate the place and we had to walk quite a distance from Canary Wharf station (with our heavy luggage ) to the hotel. A few people we asked on the way do not seem to know where this hotel is located. The staff is rather unfriendly and aloof and it can feel quite scary to walk back to the hotel along the dimly lit street late at night. At the end of our stay we were told that we would have to 150 pounds for losing the room key as they would need to change the lock! Although this rule was stated in the service agreement in fine print in view of the exorbitant charge, it should be clearly highlighted to us verbally when we check in or in the email booking confirmation. So make sure you don;t lose the key. Most moden hotels and service aparatments have the digital card key system but Marlin Apartments are still fitted with keys. The receptionist merely asked us to sign the form and said that a security deposit of 200 pounds would be deducted from our credit card to pay for any damages. They refused to waive the charges even though the key was misplaced whilst we were in the room and therefore there is no security risk. . We had also assumed wrongly that the service would be as fine and professional as that at Fraser's apartment Canary wharf (which is nearer to the train station and of much better quality in terms of service , furnishing and view)..

The apartments are managed by Marlin. We made the booking through a company named Silver Door - this was another story. We would not use them again (they showed very nice photos of the apartments on their website, but the reality was far from those photos - so do not pay any attention to the photos!). These serviced apartments are also known as South Quay apartments. The reception is at no. 9 Byng Street, Canary Wharf. We stayed at 2 different apartments: one at 9 Byng St, and one at 11 Byng Street (the building next door). The location of the buildings is handy to Canary Wharf - about 10 to 15 minutes walk to CW tube and DLR, depending on the route. The receptionist told us to turn right where we would walk along the main roads to CW. However, we later discovered an alternate route, which was quieter, by turning left which took us through the foot bridge into CW (our preferred route). The room size was reasonable and had underfloor heating (positive). While the room was well furnished, the furniture and bedding were so dated and would need to be refurbished. The bathroom has the shower over the bath. The water pressures for the shower were very weak to have a normal shower. It was hard to control the mixed temperatures - water either cold or hot! We did not like the shower at all. The underfloor heating for the apt at 11 Byng St did not work in the bathroom, where we would need it most! The lounge / kitchen was well equipped like most serviced apartments - hot plates, oven, microwave, fridge / freezer, washer / dryer, dishwasher, plus kitchen utensils, crockery and cutlery. However, the lounge suite at 9 Byng St was very old and the vinyl was peeling off the sofa. The bedroom was reasonable size, with wardrobe, however, the bed at 9 Byng St was so horrible. It had to be the worst we had slept on. Truly, Marlin needs to put a new mattress in the room we stayed. We could feel every spring on that mattress. It was so thin and worn out. One of us had to sleep on the sofa. The apartment at 9 Byng St was on a higher floor, so it was bright. In contrast, the apartment at 11 Byng St was on a lower floor, so it was very dark - making us feeling very depressed, not seeing much sunshine! The apartment at 9 Byng St had wired internet connection, but the apartment at 11 Byng St had wifi. The internet connection in both buildings was slow, very intermittent and unreliable most days - which was very annoying for us. Overall, our stay at these apartments had not been very comfortable. We read that some reviewers had more positive experience than we did. It could be that they were allocated better rooms? However, we cannot recommend these apartments at all. We stayed there because they were probably among the cheapest? - other apartments in the area were above 150 pounds a night. It is the old saying, you never get more for what you pay and often it is less, much less!

When we got to the place there was about 6 or 7 rubbish bags by the lift blocking the way not to mention the smell and that took ages to be cleared, the walls need all around maintenance. The corridor for the flats looks like student hall small and narrow, the cleaner blocked our flat door with her trolley and didn't even come to move it when we called the person staying in the flat came out to move it and apologise saying the cleaner was inside his flat. Every time we went to reception there seemed to be a unhappy customer. Now I don't know if people are aware of this but you can't have a pull down bed and called it a luxury flat and even worse no air con, in the times we live in air con is a must, the room was boiling hot because we were facing the sun and overlooking the estates across the road...nice... We went to reception to ask about it and the smart staff lady said that in England it doesn't get that hot so there is no need for air con, I'm sorry but I live in London and not so far from canary wharf in the past 5 to 10 year it has been very hot during the summer not for the whole of it but in patches.

I ended up staying two nights and have thankfully now been relocated (after much hassle) to a far superior dwelling. On arrival, around 11pm after a long day travelling with two large, heavy suitcases and a messenger bag, I was greeted by the night concierge who took ID and made me sign a check-in form. I was then handed the keys to my studio (Apartment 24 in 11 Byng Street) and was left to my own devices. No welcome pack was given to me and I was not offered any help with my bags. Incidentally, when I arrived, the apartments are directly across the road from a block of council flats. At the time I arrived 5 people were lined up, handcuffed next to a riot van ready to be taken to jail. The whole area looked very unsafe at night. Arriving in apartment 24, I was immediately disappointed. The balcony door had been left open so the apartment was FREEZING COLD. I went to close the door but found the door was broken and would not lock. Not only is this poor form but also incredibly dangerous when so close to street level in terms of security. Further investigation of the apartment revealed further problems. The Sky digital card had expired so had a constant error message on screen asking to replace the card or lose viewing. The trash can in the kitchen area was in pieces and broken. The kitchen surfaces were grubby along with grubby walls, floors and light fixtures. I did find my welcome pack in the kitchen though, a half drunk bottle of Malin Apartments mineral water. Nice! I went downstairs to the concierge, asking to be moved to another apartment. After checking I wasn't lying to him by coming up and checking my room he agreed to relocate me to apartment 13. Bare in mind it's late now, around 12:30am. He showed me round, it appeared to be far better than #24. Then he left, leaving me to lock the door. The door wouldn't lock properly from the inside! I called the concierge back, he fiddled with the lock so much that the next door neighbour came out and complained (it was now around 1:30am). It ended up with him locking me in my apartment and feeding the keys through the letter box announcing he'd see it was fixed the next day! Inspecting #24 before bed, I found power sockets on the walls were loose and actually coming off the wall. The walls and floors and kitchens were again sticky and grubby. The radiator in #24 bathroom was also coming off the wall so I dare not touch it in case it fell! On top of all that, the broadband internet in both apartments not only was NOT wireless but the ethernet cable in 13 did not work (lucky I had my own!) but the supposed 'high speed' was none existant. It was worse than a 33.6 baud modem connection! Now it gets interesting. The next morning I explained to work that I wanted out of such a dingy hole of a building. Work agreed to relocate me and found me a much better apartment elsewhere in London. HOWEVER, I had to check out yesterday before 2pm else I would be charged an extra days stay. I arrived at 1:45pm and rather than grabbing my bags immediately and THEN checking out, I explained to the lady on concierge that I was checking out immediately. She said all I need do is hand back my keys as I never made the booking. I grabbed my things and handed the keys in at 1:58pm. I know this to be true as I have email evidence showing I contacted work to inform them exactly the time I checked out, with timestamps. You'd think all would be well. Well no, no it is not. Malin Apartments notified my work stating that the concierge at Canary South TOLD MARLIN that I checked out at 3:30PM AND WOULD INCUR A FURTHER NIGHT STAY ON MY INVOICE! LIARS! BLATANT LIARS! I have CCTV footage as proof and a witness statement to back it up that I arrived at my place of work WELL BEFORE 3:30PM when they told Marlin that I checked out. Right now I am still wrestling for a refund and an apology. I would recommend NOBODY ever EVER book ANYTHING through Marlin. They are LIARS. The Canary South apartments are dirty, badly managed and VASTLY overpriced for what they are. They are also in a rather rough looking area and convey absolutely NONE of the image they conjour up on their website. STEER WELL CLEAR.

I booked a studio suite at the Marlin South Canary at a rate of \u00a3120 for the night. Upon arrival, I was allocated Appt. 41 in building 9 Byng Street. When I entered the room I noticed it was very warm and the only window in the entire apartment would only open about 5cm in a diagonal fashion, rather than opening fully outwards. As the evening progressed, the room became even hotter. The bathroom was also very stuffy and we discovered that this was as a result of the mirror being heated internally, perhaps to prevent condensation. However on a hot day, in a room with a window that only opens a crack, this is definitely not suitable. At roughly 11pm, the temperature in the room was no longer bearable, at which point I went down to the reception in 9 Byng Street to ask the person on duty if there was any way to open the window any further or if there was any help that could be provided. There was a gentleman at the desk, and I told him the room we were staying in and told him it was very hot and asked if there was anything that could be done. He responded by asking \u201cwould you like a fan?\u201d and when I said yes, he responded almost immediately saying \u201cactually sorry they are all given out to other guests\u201d. So why offer me something which you cannot provide?! I then said is there any way the window can open further, to which he replied \u201cno sorry, I know that room\u2019s window does not open very much as a previous guest has also had the same problem and complained about the heat\u201d. I was amazed to hear this and found it shocking that if this issue has been previously brought to the attention of management, and it was a night that was known to be hot, why were we allocated that room? I went for a walk outside for a few minutes to cool down and get away from the heat of the room (after 11pm). During this walk I went to a store and bought some cold bottles of water, however when I returned to the room, we discovered that these could not be kept cold for very long as the refrigerator was broken. We tried to sleep but it was just too hot and we felt like we were in a sauna. At 1am we decided to try and go to another hotel but at that point we realised it would be tough to find another room nearby as it was so late. So we slept very little because of the heat and had an extremely uncomfortable night. The room was still very hot in the morning and the entire stay was very substandard. A fundamental point of any hotel stay is the quality of comfort and sleep your guests get, but we got hardly any sleep due to the conditions in the room. I am amazed at the fact that guests had previously complained about the heat issue in that room, however it was still allocated to us for that night, which was known to be very hot, and on top of that we were told at the time of booking that all rooms had \u201clovely large windows\u201d! When i checked out, I told the duty manager about our experiences, and she herself recommended that I complain officially and ask for a refund. However when I wrote an e-mail about our experiences, I had to continually chase up a response from the manager called Ian. After repeated attempts to contact him he told me that they were unable to offer me a refund as there was nothing wrong with the room. He asked if i could remember the name of the staff member who had taken my reservation and told me the room would be cool. I wasnt aware that I needed to take staff names when making bookings?! As I couldnt remember the name, he told me that noone admitted saying this to me, and \"based on the evidence\", my claim for a refund given that Marlin had misrepresented their room quality was denied. Its not surprising that the staff service was so poor when the manager himself is so incompetent and basically calls his dissatisfied customers liars! I cant get my money back but i definitely wouldnt want anyone else to waste their money by staying here.

When we arrived there was one bath towel and small hand towel despite the booking stating that it was for three adults. There was also no welcome and we had no understanding of how to 'book in' until we rang the main office line and was subsquently advised what to do. The towel situation was rectified however, on our arrival back to the apartments (we went to a concert at the O2 arena) we were greeted by a large number of youths who were 'hanging out' in the stair well. The security door to the apartments was faulty and was therefore accessible to anyone. The youths were aggressive to my friends and I and were clearly intoxicated as there were cans of beer and crisp packets strewn all over the staircase. At one point, a youth threatened my partner with physical violence after he had asked them to move out of the way in order to allow us to retreat to our room. Throughout the night, we were subjected to excessive noise (swearing and shouting) and doors banging. We attempted to contact the duty manager (by their extension) and main reception number several times throughout the night but received no answer. We did contemplate calling the police but as the large group of youths were outside our apartment door all night we were fearful of reprecussions. At 8am, we were disturbed again by a youth asking us whether we had a mop as he had been asked by a staff member to clean up the hallway. The staff member was in the hallway and we asked if we could see the manager as none of us had slept all night. The staff member promised to get the manager. Two and a half hours later, we had not seen the manager and tried to telephone again but without success. In addition to this, we had no hot water therefore, none of us could bathe/shower before we left. We left London very tired and unhappy with the whole experience. It felt very unsafe in the middle of the night and we had no one to contact although I appreciate we could have phoned the police.

We had paid \u00a3250 a night and it didn't seem worth it until I recently stayed in a normal hotel room and I can appreciate the size now. However, there is no furniture ie chairs/tables on the balcony. I was Very disappointed with the location. If you want to travel by public transport to sightsee..this is NOT the apartments for you. You not only have to ge the tube, you need to pay extra everyday for the DLR ( docklands railway service) as there is no tube nearby. The DLR is also hard to find and it a good 15 min walk. There are a few local shops & takeaways near by which are OK but no where to eat out as such. There is a small local supermarket where you can pick up essentials. Our view from the 'top' penthouse looked like a construction site. There is alot of work & building going on around the whole area. It was very noisy from early morning until late afternoon, even on the Sunday. The nearest general surroundings are blocks of flats. These are residential flats and lets just say they're 'council estates'. We spotted a few groups of youths around outside when on our balcony at night.

As I wanted free broadband there was not much choice and I agreed to take a near-new apartment in Canary South. Before the managing agents would accept my booking I had to sign and fax back a contract that agreed to give one month's notice if I had to cancel. I had to pay a deposit and there was a 5% surcharge for using Amex and 3% for Visa or MC. I only needed 6 nights. Finally it was agreed that I had complied with all the RULES and was emailed confirmation which told me check-in time was 3pm. Check out time was 9am. I was to get to the apartments and enter a code to get in and anothercode in a box to get my key. My plane from Australia arrived midday and I arrived at the apartments by taxi just after 2.30pm. Ok... so I got past the first door into a small entry with boxes on the wall. I found my box, put in the code and there was no key. No seat, no concierge, no where to put my luggage. A pager number but no phone - and my Australian mobile phone wasn't active. Although exhausted after 24 hours travel I had to wait it out until the magical 3pm. A lady came down in the lift and I asked if she could advise me who would be putting the key in the box. She was the housekeeper but needed to call the pager. She got no response. I wouldn't let her go!! She kept trying the pager number and finally got authority to give me my key. The apartment was pleasantly furnished and the broadband worked well. There was no dressing table in the bedroom and the only place with a power point and mirror for drying hair was in the lounge. The instructions for all the equipment was well set out and easy to follow. The shower was over the bath with a folding glass screen. There was no non-slip mat in the bath and no handles to hold onto getting in and out of the very steep bath. This would not be suitable for elderly people\u2026 not really safe for anyone. The towels were small. No corkscrew or salt and pepper shakers. A very strange welcome pack that included Cornflakes, tea and coffee but no milk. While staying there I emailed the managers with my concerns and suggestions. I was as good as told no one else had complained and that they would look into a dressing table in the bedroom for future developments. No thanks for my feedback about the slippery bath.
