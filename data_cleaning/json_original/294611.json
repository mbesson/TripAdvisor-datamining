It's so year 2000 to charge for that. Any decent 4 or 5 star hotel should give this as a free service. It is like if you would have to pay for the soap in the bathroom. I would offer a limited free service in the room like 10MBit performance, upload and download limits. But then offer a premium service for 200MBit performance and no limits for instance. That I would be happy to pay for.

I had stayed at the Divan several years ago, prior to the renovation and have watched them building over the past three years. It has been worth the wait. Everything about this hotel is fantastic! From the initial impression upon entering the lobby to the beautfiul rooms, the spectacular spa area and of course the classis Divan Patisserie. I have stayed in all of the hotels that I can view from my room (Hyatt, InterContinental, and The Marmara) and this is hands down my most favorite. The rooms are a ncie blend of beiges and browns. The marble bathrooms are spacious, featuring Molton Brown products with a separate shower and bath. There is an in-room safe to accommodate laptop (with charging station) and a nice selection in the minibar. Little details are well thought out with electronically controlled shades, tv speakers in the bathroom and 3 telephones in the room. The spa/fitness area is one of the finest I have seen - real resort quality with candle lit hallways, high ceilinged corridors, relaxation rooms, steam room, sauna, a hammam,a Pilates studio and a wonderful pool. All of the staff is courteous to a fault and aim to please. I asked for a room change and they were quick to oblige. If you are seeking a nice place to rest after a long day of sightseeing, a romantic getaway or even a staycation, I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rugby, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel but Noisy and Smokey!\u201d", "Author": "matkincc", "ReviewID": "UR125130281", "Content": "I have stayed at this hotel several times and the decor and service are very good and the staff are professional, friendly and courteous.

The staff is extremely polite and helpful! Rooms are so comfortable, size is right to the point and design is great! Even if my windows were looking to the road, I slept like an angel because of silence. The bathroom is huge! They even have scales there. Service was on a very good level. The food is great! Products are fresh and breakfast is very rich and tasty! Hotel has own sweets shop and every day after room service is done you can find chocolate next to your bed! :) The only small minus is that internet is not for free. We also arranged one of the meeting rooms for the presentation and it was very comfortable and neat. The snack set was very fresh with a good range of products and good service.

The bathrooms, in particular, will satisfy the most fussy business traveler and the most fastidious tourist. Large, good products, hot strong shower. Everything you will want. The beds are wonderful even if you have to struggle a bit to turn off all of the lights and lower the shade. The Divan has a great small bar and a very good Turkish restaurant. It also has a Japanese restaurant that has attracted a lot of attention. I tried it and I would urge you to go Turkish. The Japanese cuisine is fine but the staff doesn't know how to guide most people through the incredibly complicated menu. And, the Kaizei menu, which receives rave reviews, has to be ordered in advance which meant that I did not try it. All in all, this is one of the best hotels that I have stayed in over the past three years and I have stayed in some very good ones in London, Berlin, Chicago, Tokyo and Seoul.

They are named in a way that sometimes you might get confused between them. The names of the streets do not help a lot. I am rating here the one in Cumhuriyer cad. Having said that, the hotel is extremely pleasant. Medium size (not a mammoth hotel) which helps to make you feel home. Very elegant without excesses. An excellent feeling of \"new\" (which in my opinion is very important in hotels). Personnel extremely helpful without being too heavy (for example they do not insist in accompanying you in the room at check-in unless you need it, which I find very appropriate). Both rooms and bathrooms are very spacious. Breakfast offers a very large and first class choice. If I have to find one small fault, is about the long time needed to get really hot water in the shower. A you see, a very marginal issue. The hotel is in great location both for tourist and for business travellers which have their business in the surroundings. I'm saying that because, as everybody that has been in Istanbul knows, the traffic is really heavy in this huge city, especially at certain times in the day (late afternoon you better walk) and cars can find themselves stuck for very long time.

This was not our first stay and in one of our previous stays the hotel staff was very kind to supply warm milk to our son at midnight. This was the reason why we preferred Divan as our first choice to stay in Istanbul. Divan Istanbul just opened its door after exclusive renovation. Food is excellent as it always has been. We never wanted to walk off from breakfast as fruits, bread and yogurt was as home made. You can easily feel the quality and sensitive touch of the hotel management at each location. First of all, all the staff is friendly and smiling. They try to do their best at all instances. One night we invited our Australian and Japanese friends for tea to the bar. Although it was not in their menu the staff picked up Turkish tea from the pastry and served Udon from the Japanese restaurant of the hotel. One night we dined at the Turkish restaurant of the hotel. The risotto was the best we ever tried. Our son went for Tandir kebab which was also excellent. Their vine menu and fresh fruit drink were also excellent. Our son who is 12 years old received a connecting room for him. Needles to say, he enjoyed his own TV channels as a courtesy of the hotel management. Although located at the center of Taksim, the rooms were very quiet due to good isolation. A delicate of touch for the bed and furniture including all details of the bathroom makes us think that we will look forward staying in this hotel soon again. The only draw back was the pool that was under construction but we never had the will to swim during our stay. We cordially recommend the Divan hotel due to its very good location and hospitality.

Our main complaint was that the Divan did not offer access to a gym or pool while theirs is under construction. Instead we had to pay ($50+) to use the gym at another hotel next door. The Divan should have made arrangements for guests during construction and found a way to provide guest passes.
