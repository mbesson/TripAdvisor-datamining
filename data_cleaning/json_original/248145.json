{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Quiet, extended stay place This is a small motel / apartment operation that co-exists with a larger condo development. Prices are reasonable - facilities are a little dated, but clean and well maintained. No one at front desk at nite - but if you want to be at this location, it would be a good choice - very quiet. We had no complaints, and would stay here again", "Date": "May 21, 2004", "ReviewID": "UR215397978", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "y7u8i9o0"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g31310-d248145-r2101832-Sierra_Grande_Suites-Phoenix_Arizona.html", "HotelID": "248145", "Price": "$74"}}
