My room was only $77 (cheapest room I could find during Easter) a night yet the hotel was very modern, clean, and trendy decor. The concept is simple; you get a nice room with no perks for cheap. Yes the room doesn't have a closet, phone, mini bar, etc. But for those of us that are on a budget yet we want a nice, clean, and modern room to come back to after a day of shopping and touring this is the perfect hotel. Last year I experienced some issues with the wifi internet but this year I asked for a room close to the router. The front desk clerk recommended a room on the Z floor which is where the hotel gets the best internet. I was in room Z35 and the internet worked perfectly this year.

We chose this hotel for our New Year trip to Berlin and were glad with our choice. The hotel is modern, clean, stylish. The staff is young, very friendly, amiable and helpful. Despite that the hotel is big, it is very quiet and clean, has a nice and cosy bar with good selection of drinks and snacks. The room is small but very comfortable, is equipped with everything you need, plus has a nice and trendy decor. If you pay for breakfast (7.50 euro) you will have unlimited wi-fi access, which was working good in our room. Also there is wi-fi in lobby for free and you can take iPad at reception and use it in lobby for free. Bathroom is the tinest I've ever seen, but also comfirtable and there is a good hairdryer, shower and big mirrors. Beds and linen are nice - we slept very well. Rooms were cleaned every day and towels were changed regularly. Breakfast is very good - plenty of food - corn flakes, muesli, different types of cheese, ham, bread, croissants, eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables. There is no hot dishes (which might be good in winter times), however this does not spoil impression from unhurried and substantial breakfast. Location is the greatest advantage of this Motel One - 3 min from Kudamm, KaDeWe and the nearest U station. It is very easy to get to the both airports (Tegel and Schoenefeld) from it and to the main sightseeings of Berlin. Zoo is 10 min of walking distance. There are only three things i didn't like - payment at check in, very high temperature at hallways and broken towel hanger in the bathroom. On the whole, Motel One Tiergarten is a perfect value for money with a great location.

Internet: When we checked in we asked the woman at the desk if the room came with free wifi. She said only if you paid for breakfast (7.50 per day), but she couldn't tell if we had paid for breakfast. One of her colleagues came to her rescue and showed her that we had not paid for breakfast. So then the wireless internet cost 5 euros a day. What she didn't tell us was because of the password system only one computer/device could be logged on at a time, unless you pay 10 euros a day to get two passwords. And the login screen was deathly slow to appear, and sometime didn't show up at all. The wireless occasionally stopped working entirely, or kicked us off and made us login again. It was quite annoying. There is also free wifi in the lobby, but you need a password to use that as well. ROOM and BED: The apartment was very clean and modern looking. The bed was two twin beds in one frame, with the annoying crack down the middle, and separate twin comforters for each person. The mattress was firm, and we found it comfortable. The room was small with no drawers--just a few hangers to hang shirts up, and open shelves on only one side of the bed. I would have preferred shelves on both sides of the bed, but it was acceptable. Note there is no telephone in the room so if you need to talk to the front desk you have to go down. There is a public telephone in the lobby. NOISE and TEMPERATURE: The room was pretty quiet. We heard only muffled sounds from the neighboring room. The room was quite warm even without the heat on, but we just opened a window and the temperature was fine. The hallways were very warm. BATHROOM: The bathroom had a very nice modern shower with plenty of hot water and good pressure (but no bath). But the shower could not hold a constant temperature. The water switched between cool and boiling hot. I almost got burned several times. This was an issue at all times of the day. The bathroom also had a hair dryer. FOOD: We never tried the breakfast. FITNESS CENTER: None. COST: 74 euros a night. Pretty cheap. (Plus 5 euros per day wireless costs per computer.) LOCATION: The location was okay, not great. It's pretty close to the Wittenbergplatz U-bahn, but at night when it was cold I personally wished it was just a tad closer. (I'm a wimp when it comes to the cold.) The street it's on is pretty busy and the area in general is not at all charming, and there's not a lot in the immediate vicinity in terms of restaurants and cafes. There are more charming areas closer to Savignyplatz or Nollendorfplatz. OVERALL: If you're planning to stay in this area, the Motel One Berlin-Tiergarten hotel is an acceptable choice (except for the constantly changing temperature of the shower and the annoying issues with the wifi). But next time we will probably try a different hotel.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Runcorn, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cUltra modern hotel in a fantastic location!\u201d", "Author": "h_mchugh", "ReviewID": "UR119014174", "Content": "Me and my husband just got back from a 4 night stay at Motel One Tiergarten, and it was fab!
