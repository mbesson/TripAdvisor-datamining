This hotel is so below basic sanitary norms that I am surprised it still survives. The only explanation would be people confusing it with the other Cavendish (in Mayfair) and booking in this disgrace of a hotel service. No lift. This really should be written on their website in big bold red. Single room is not big enough to fit a suitcase. Obviously the personnel of this hotel thinks that suitcases are living beings, so they will walk upstairs on their own, and if you are travelling with a suitcase you should book a double. Audibility is great \u2013 you can hear everything your neighbors are doing! I certainly could appreciate traditional folk singing outside at 3 a.m. in the morning. It was too cold to sleep, anyway - the heater in my room was not working. To get it working, you should go to reception and ask \u2013 they will switch it on for you for a couple of hours. This is not something that I gladly do in the middle of the night. Blanket in the room had no changeable cover over it. It was DIRTY. The carpet on the floor was DIRTY. I was staying there for 6 nights and the room was not cleaned even once. I wonder if they know how to use a vacuum cleaner at all. Once I dropped something on the floor and had to look under the table to pick it up. I wish I had not. There was no hot water in the shower \u2013 only warm (kind of). It does take 10 minutes to rinse off shampoo from your hair because the water is barely streaming. Shower cabin is for S size people only. If you are wearing M \u2013 you will not fit in there. If you are L, you will not be able to make it to the bathroom at all. One brilliant morning reception called me to inform that the shower in my room is leaking on the floor below. I bet this happens with them on regular basis. On their website their advertise \u201cfree high speed wifi\u201d. This does not exist.

The short version is that we dropped our bags in our room, went to a movie theater the desk clerk recommended only to find the theater was closed (no special reason - just regular business hours the clerk should have known and told us about), then returned to the hotel to find that we were locked out of our room. Long story short, it took an hour to get into the room and the help of a clerk from another hotel to get us into the room. My wife, who was getting sick anyway, sat in a hallway that was inexcusably hot while we kept trying to get into the room. All the while we totally kept our calm, though we were both getting upset. We got into the room, again, which was just way too hot for anybody's comfort (there was a single fan blowing in the lobby, the main door was wide open to let the summer heat inside, and no A/C). The next morning, I calmly explained that I believed our inconvenience the previous night was unacceptable and merited a discount. I asked for 20% off, which I felt was more than fair, given that I actually wanted to ask for half off. I was told to come back and speak to the booking manager who would be in later that morning. I did so, and was told it would be taken care of. We stayed there in the middle of July, it is now the end of August. We received our credit card bill, and were charged the full amount for the room. I have contacted them twice (repeating my detailed explanation of our problem) to correct this and receive the 20% discount we were promised, and have still heard no reply of any kind. You should also be aware that the rooms are inexcusably small. I am 6'4\" tall - the room itself is exactly that wide, and maybe 5 feet long ... two people can indeed fit in the bed, but not comfortably (especially when it's hot) and there is absolutely no room to move around in.

Booked two rooms as our party was my wife and myseld plus my 77 year old mother who has moblity issues. Hence a double room and a single room which give rise to slightly different experiences. The overall hotel is superbly positioned for the West End, particularly the British Museum and positioned directly between Euston Station and the Museum - easily walkable. It is an old substantial house which has been converted, hence there are a lot of stairs to reach rooms, but banisters allow impaired mobility access but not for someone who can not leave their wheel chair for short ditances. Reception is 24 hours and they were happy to have luggage left with them prior to checkout and after checkout, so that you can continue with your visit to London without dragging bags with you. The double room was clean and reasonably sized (room 103) at the front of the hotel. The small double bed was comfortable with clean sheets - I needed a second pillow as the ones on the bed were a little tired but this was supplied in the wardrobe complete with clean pillow case. Complimentry tea and coffee making facilites had plenty of supplies. The shower room had a high step to walk into it but it was again clean, plently of towels although they were a little thin together with bars of soap and shampoo were provided. It was a little noisy at times during the night as heavy traffic passed by. There was a small wall mounted flat screen TV with freeview diital channels and free wifi. Overall, for a \u00c2\u00a3125 central London room, including a cooked breakfast - this room left a good impression. The single room was not as good. Room 104 had a single bed which covered the entire width of the room and was against the outside window wall. No curtains - just a pull down blind (in contrast with the nicly curtained 103). The flat screen TV had only an internal ariel in the room and was unwatchable. The bed occupied the room at its widest point and after a couple of feet into the room, the width narrowed to about half the length of the bed where it accomodated the ensuite shower room. This was perfectly adequate and of the same standard as the one in the double room. Overall, clean but very small, and with the bed pressed against the outside wall, quite noisy. The cooked breakfast was served in a room in the basement, not enough tables to accomodated everyone at once but turnover meant that this was not a real issue. the food quality was excellent with english breakfast consisting of bacon, sausage, tomato, beans and a choice of eggs. Cereal, fruit juices, fruit and yoghurt were vailable for self service. Toast was automatically brought to the table and the coffee cafetierre was refilled without needing to be asked. Staff were very good and friendly.

Again, I told the night receptionsit and he said, 'There is nothing I can do until the morning.' Fair Enough. The next morning we had to catch the early train and tried to check out. I complained that the t.v and shower did not work, the receptionist said there was nothing he could do as I did not pay full price for the room as I booked through Hotels.com. If I had known that getting a discount meant that I could not have used the t.v or shower, I would have paid full price! I asked if the manager would phone me, which he never did. I phoned again, no response, tried again, no response. In the end I called the Hotel 13 times over a ten day period! In the end the receptionist said that the manager did not want to speak to me.

Back then the rooms were not exactly up to par -- the breakfast room was not really clean, my room had bare walls and a window that wouldn't shut properly -- but the rates reflected this quality and frankly, the location could hardly be better. I decided to book the same hotel for a business trip to London. I checked their Web site and was encouraged by pretty pictures of modern rooms. I was a litle surprised that such a small hotel, with small rooms to begin with could turn into the pretty pictures on the site. Considering that the rates had tripled (yes, tripled), I figured the quality had also tripled. I booked a single room. On arrival it was clear that the hotel had been renovated. Clean carpets, bright lights, even a front desk. Though the heaters were working full blast making it unbarably hot, I felt reassured that I had made the right choice. Then I was shown to my room #202. The door opened onto a very narrow and long entrance -- the word narrow isn't strong enough. Its width was no larger than the distance from one outstretched arm to the other outstretched elbow. And I am a short person. Towards the end of this entrance, a very narrow desk (barely wider than a laptop). At the end of it, a single bed squeezed against a wall with a window. No room on either side of the bed for lamps or table. In short, it really felt like I was in a sleeper cabin in an old fashion train. I had to put my bag sideways on the floor for it to fit, and could only open it with difficulty. I sat on the bed and realized immediately that the window didn't shut properly. I wondered if this was the same room I had had in the past...at about 2 in the morning, I was woken up by a man on the street below having a conversation on his cell phone. He was planning some kind of a party with his friends. I felt like I was in the street with him. I would not recommend this hotel, particularly considering the high rates. Even its great location isn't worth it. There are many other B&Bs on that street. Note of warning: do *not* ask them to book you a taxi. They use a private taxi who will overcharge you.

The manager kindly let me into 'my' room before the check in time, but when I got there somebody elses things were already in there - I had been given the wrong room. Previous reviews suggest that this has happened before, which raises issues about the security arrangements. 3. The 'full' English breakfast consisted of one egg, one slice of bacon and half a tomato - not very 'full' in my opinion! 4. There was no actual phone in the room, only a phone socket, and I was asked if I was going to want to watch telly - suggesting that if I said no, I would have been put in a room without one of these either! 5. The single room was very small, even by London standards. 6. The management/organisation seemed a little eratic and did not fill me with confidence, even though I did not have any major problems myself. All in all, this was not a bad place to stay and met my needs for the two nights I was there, but I think I would look around for somewhere else next time, as there were too many little niggles and incompetancies.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cavendish Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g186338-d574687-Reviews-Cavendish_Hotel-London_England.html", "Price": "$113 - $246*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">75 Gower Street</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Bloomsbury</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">London</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">WC1E 6HJ</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">England</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "574687", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/1b/3a/1b3a7b4fbb09ee5a5d113727896967c86large.jpg"}}
