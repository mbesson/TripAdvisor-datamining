It was very central (15 minute walk from Central station) and in a much better part of town, in front of a very nice enchanting park, away from the very busy, dirty, and crowded red light district, But close enough to visit it. The rooms were very clean and new. Staff very helpful like my remote control not working properly and being replaced right away or having our luggage safely stored while waiting for check in. The shared bathrooms are very clean and well kept and never busy or engaged given there's 2 per 4 rooms floor. The only downfall is the coffee shop and 2 clubs downstairs which specially during the weekends can be very noisy but not if you are on the 4th floor like we did.

Nice clean place to stay in a great location with alot of attractions within walking distance. Breakfast is in smokeys bar which is to the left when you come out of the door and was pleasent but nothing out of the ordinary. Perfect to set you up for the day though, and no limitations to how much you could have. Didnt really have any plans we just spent the days walking around taking in the scenery and doing a bit of shopping. Came across the zoo which if you are a family travelling would have to be amsterdams best kept secret. Lots of things to do in the area and there is a tram stop just across the road so you can travel a little further out. Stayed on the fourth floor overlooking the square, was a lovely view but did have to close the window at night due to the noise of the clubs below, although after a long days walk fell asleep pretty easily. Bathrooms are shared with another three rooms however never had to wait for them and were always clean and fresh. I would say if your not there for the nightlife it probably isnt the best place to stay, especially if your a light sleeper. The stairs up to the rooms are fairly steep and seem to go on forever after a night out, (but then most places in amsterdam are due to the nature of the buildings). would recommend using the central station to get back and for to the airport as travel is easy and cheap. Got a taxi to the hotel for 45euro, which is a little scary with all the bikes and trams, but then braved it on the way back and walked the 10min walk over to the station and paid 8euros for both of us to the airport. You get out actually in the aiport and only takes about 15mins, was much easier and felt much safer. overall would recommend as the hotel is clean well kept and in a prime location but just be aware of its little downfalls.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nottingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat find\u201d", "Author": "spursaway", "ReviewID": "UR125079460", "Content": "I stopped here when my football team played here and found the cheapest place I could find.a twin room for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 a night an absolute bargain for me and my mate.i was fearing the worst due to the price but on arrival I was surprised how clean the place was.but best of all is the location.my room overlooked Rembrandt square that had an ice rink and Xmas market on it,and the hotel is in the middle of everything in Amsterdam.the steep stairs are a struggle after 15hours partying but it's the same in other hotels due to the nature of the buildings.the buffet breakfast is as good as any in Europe,there all pretty much the same.all in all a cracking little hotel.and smokeys below the hotel is worth travelling to Amsterdam alone a great place where I've never laughed so much since I watched my best mate fall in the river whilst fishing in the summer of 1988", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Galway, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cBest EVER!! great value for money\u201d", "Author": "grace o", "ReviewID": "UR122543838", "Content": "Best value for money. its only a one star so we were expecting it to be dirty, smelly, unhelpful staff but it was fresh, clean and the most helpful staff you could ask for. recently painted. we were on the top floor(not fun walking up them after a few j's or drinks!) bed sheets and towels cleaned single day. best location u could ask for. opposite Escape niteclub few more pubs, restruants and two coffeeshops side by side the hotel.. get bubblegum in the coffeeshop below the hotel. laughed my bum off for an hour. little sink and mirror in room. full length mirror also. it is 2 shared bathrooms with another room on each floor. water so warm and we never crossed path with other guests which was great. television little flatscreen load of channels. book early and you'll get it really cheap. two of us for 4 nights , twin room for 120euro each!!", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Northampton, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cCheap and Cheerful...Close to centre\u201d", "Author": "danni_yelly", "ReviewID": "UR122284120", "Content": "I have been to this hotel numerous times as it is so cheap and very close to Dam Square (about a 10-15 minute walk).

We paid about $120 for a double. Pros: -The hotel is cute and clean -Staff was friendly and helpful -Easy to reach from Centraal Station via the tram line (unless you get one of the old school #9 trams with the narrow door and steps into the tram) Neutral: I was under the impression the bathrooms were suite style, with two rooms connected to a bathroom. On the second floor, there were five rooms for two bathrooms. The toilet and shower are in the same room, so any use of the bathroom occupies all uses of it. We had no problems with this, but left at 7:30 am for a flight. Mornings could be touchy if all rooms are in double occupancy and 10 people are sharing 2 bathrooms. Con: -Steep stairs with no lift. This is typical of Amsterdam hotels and I was expecting it. I need a word stronger for con, so how about Nuclear Option Con: -The lovely square that your room overlooks turns into an all-night discotheque when the sun goes down. I am a city girl, live in the heart of Washington DC, and am well used to street noises. So I generally dismiss hotel complaints about street noise, assuming the reviewers are suburban wimps. You will dismiss complaints about noise at this hotel at your peril. When we checked in I was a little concerned about being too chilly at night as the windows are not sealed at all and air was blowing through the point where the two panes meet. The temperature turned out to be fine. What I didn't realize was that it would feel like my bed was dab smack in the middle of a club when I tried to go to sleep. Shouting, singing, glass breaking, and the pulsing beat of a European club might be fun memories if you intentionally put yourself in that situation. If it's in your bedroom, not so much. I am a heavy sleeper and was completely exhausted so I managed to fall asleep and stay asleep after about half an hour, but my travel companion didn't sleep at all. We stayed only one night and I don't think even I, the champion sleeper, could have handled another.

It is Tuesday evening/Wed morning and there are no signs of letting up (we are also on the third floor, the people on the second floor must be losing their $hit).

I was a little worried about shared bathrooms as I don't usually go for this, but the hotel wasn't fully booked and the bathrooms were incredibly clean and not used by anyone but us (that we saw). The room itself was small, but ok, with comfortable bed, working radiator, fan and LCD tv. Each room had a wash basin as well. In this respect the hotel is pretty good, however it is located in a square similar to Times Square NYC and Leicester Square London and the hotel is not double glazed. Therefore the noise at night is incredible. The nightclubs below the hotel and opposite are loud and go all night. Personally we were there to party, so I didn't mind, however be warned, these clubs don't close until 5 - 6 am and only then does the square become quiet. During the early hours it is alive with people screaming and shouting, music playing and general city centre noise. It is very difficult to block out. We were at the front of the hotel so it was pretty bad, I am not sure how the noise compares if you're at the back of the hotel, and therefore not directly facing the square. Difficult one to really review, however it was clean, breakfast was ok, the rooms were fine and service was friendly. Location could be ignored if you're in Dam to party, but its for teenagers, travellers and stag do's, less for families and couples etc. Oh and it was being renovated whilst were there, so may well be even nicer inside very soon.", "Date": "February 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood location at a great price!\u201d", "Author": "whirldtour", "ReviewID": "UR45660502", "Content": "Good location, close to siteseeing activities, well connected to the transit system, close to top-rated clubs and restaurants.", "Date": "October 2, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cBetter than expected, but bring your earplugs !\u201d", "Author": "Daveyboy03", "ReviewID": "UR35030929", "Content": "The rembrandt square hotel was better than expected but only just ! I was handed the 'short straw' & given a room two doors away & two floors up. The climb up the stairs was a steep climb & the carpet & walls were stained & grubby. However, my room was clean & freshly painted & the bathroom looked newly fitted & brand new ! The room was basic & the bed very comfortable. The rembrandt is a family run hotel with the rooms situated above & next to the noisy clubs below. I thankfully brought my earplugs & had a few drinks & slept through the music which continued till 4am. My major issue with this hotel was the manager & his staff at the breakfast room. The food was laid out on bar tables inside smokeys nightclub & was in no way plentiful. The manager noticed that i had gone up for 'seconds' & looked me in the eye before removing my first plate & unfinished drink ! This i found an insult !! On the 2nd morning the manager & his staff were watching & following my every move & this disgusted me. The manager obviously awakes in the morning with euro/pound/dollar signs in his eyes. I am glad mine was only a 2 day stay as i would have commented to the manager & spoke my mind in no uncertain terms !!! The location & price of the rembrandt square hotel were great but the managers style of business would irritate a saint !

After my experience, I think I paid too much. This is a no-frills hotel, which I do not mind, as I have stayed in many cheap hotels and hostels around Europe. No TV or Phone, only a sink in the room and a shared toilet and shower. Towels are a 5 Euro deposit, also not a big deal, but the man behind the desk was not friendly to deal with. The hotel staff was unorganized and impersonable. The man behind the desk was smoking in the adjacent room when we arrived, and the smoke filled not only the stairwell leading up from the street, but also the stairwells up to the rooms and even the hallways outside the rooms. It took him 15 minutes to find which two rooms to give us (changing the number several times on his scrap of paper where he was keeping track). When he finally picked two rooms, he talked to the cleaning person and one of them had still not yet been cleaned. So we had to wait and come back a couple hours later. The window in the room was nailed shut, so we could not open it for fresh air. To make matters worse, during the night the heater turned on and we could not turn it off. Either the dial was broken, or they control it down at the front desk. Thank goodness the sheets were at least clean or I would have checked out (from what I could see). Overall I would not recommend this hotel. I know from experience that there are other cheap hotels in Rembrandtplein, and I'd strongly suggest staying in any one of those instead.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "england", "Title": "\u201cA Great Find\u201d", "Author": "EnglandBarry", "ReviewID": "UR16267185", "Content": "When we decided to go to Amsterdam, we booked the flight and then found that the hotels where not that cheap and a lot of them where booked up.

Each time you left the hostel, you would have to hand in your key.

We booked for 2 nights for 3 people. The rooms were too narrow and maximum 2 people could stay there. Even the bathrooms and toilets we too small.. You could't even move to change clothes At 3rd day we decided the 2 of us to stay 1 more night. We asked the \"friendly\" receptionist and the \"super manager\" for a room for 2. I told them we want a room for 2, with no other people stay with us. Ok they told us, 60 euro per night!!!!!!.....for that terrible room,.... I told him the turist office told us the double room is 77 per night for 2 people ( 38 euro per person ) \" no no this is not the turist office.. There, there are other prices \" We refused and were about to leave. The manager tell us then \" ok ok 50 euros for you.. Special price!!!!! \"... Since the availability of other hotels were limited in amsterdam due to conferences and other events we accepted the price as we wanted to stay 1 more day on amsterdam. The next morning we checked out from the room we stayed 3 people and the manager said.. By 12 the room will be ready for the 2 who want to stay .. \" ok we said\" We went to town and return at 16:00 .. We were suprised as the room wasn;t ready to check in.. We said doesn;t matter let's take our laggage to room and go another round to city.. We returned at 17:00 and room wasn;t ready as expected We were surprised as the room was not on the same building we stayed before. They took us to another \"hotel\" if can be named a hotel where\" 1. At the entrance there were pornographic magazines, 2.there were plates of food thrown down 3. Old bicycles in front of entrance First impression was terrible Once the door is opened what we see: Stairs that were almost 70 degrees,, i wasn;t carry my big bag just a small handbag and i could;t get up to the floor...i wonder if a person wanted to take the big luggage up to the first floor , how will manage this? Take it up with rope like in old ages? Then we entered the room.... The smell was terrible with cigaretes and food and was so disgusting... All this for 50 euro per night per person We went to reception and complain about this terrible services offered by that people... I wonder if they could stay in that dirty disgusting place Do they think we don;t have iq and we could stay in that disgusting place!!!! We take our money back and live same night We went to stuttgart and we found a room with 35 euro per night. Full breakfast.
