There is no bar or restaurant to speak of in the htoel in case you have the idea of any nightlife and the active centre is about 45 mins walk away. If you are looking for a quite sedate hotel whcih is clean and socialble then its fine.

You can also get the A or B bus too or get a taxi for about 10 euro's and would be worth it on the on the way there! To catch the A and B bus from the hotel walk out of the hotel and cross the road and just walk up that road and the bus stop is on the left. The hotel its self was lovely and clean. The staff were helpful and spoke English. Reception have maps so just ask. We had a lovely sea view and it was beautiful to wake up to( we had a balconey too). The breakfast was good croissants,ham,cheese,cereals and fruit-loads of choice. The bed was MASSIVE! And the room was a good size. The shower was huge too and loved the little toiletries and slippers they give you. The mini bar i reasonably priced but not a lot of choice, there is a Billa supermarket a short way from the ferry. The hotel is about 15 mins from st marcs sq and is really peaceful, not much night life around the hotel and the vaporettos stops quite early but after a busy day walking around Venice it was nice to return and relax in the evenings.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Guildford, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cBeach Hotel in Venice Lido\u201d", "Author": "ChrisM1402", "ReviewID": "UR118373818", "Content": "Chose this Hotel as we thought it was good location next to the beach.

The Hotel was fine it was clean and the rooms good. Our friends changed rooms as the rooms to the rear of the hotel have some pillars in them and made them feel very small. We had room 303 and our friends had 308, which were on the top floor and had great sea views. We had a small balcony. Breakfast was very good choice and the staff very good. The hotel reception staff where very helpful, particularly Nicolas. They helped me choose a good restaurant in Venice to go to celebrate my wife's 50th called Bancogiro. The food was great but was quite pricey. Another good place to eat out on the Lido is the hotel Villa Laguna. Go and have a meal here and enjoy the best sunset of Venice you will get, again great food and staff excellent, we went here twice. The hotel enjoys the beach right in front of it and would recommend this hotel and will go back. The Lido is a great place to stay and do day trips into Venice from and come back in the afternoon and just relaxed on the beach and plan your evening out or back into Venice. The Excelsior hotel next door go and have cocktails there and enjoy the band on the terrace average of 65 euros for 4 cocktails but well worth it. The good bit for me was my wife had no clue about this holiday until we got to Gatwick so it was important to me it was a good hotel I had picked and it sure was. Also booked a private water Taxi from the airport to the hotel a great way to arrive. Going around the island and to and from Venice buy a 7 day pass.

There's a gym next door to the hotel so you hear a little music from the dance studio, but it wasn't distracting for us. This hotel is highly recommended. We got an Alilaguna water taxi directly from Marco Polo airport to the Lido and it took under an hour. We then walked to the hotel as we only had small hand luggage cases. It took us about 20 minutes. Although there is a very regular bus that goes up and down the main lido roads if you don't want to walk or can't walk too far. Or you can hire a bike for two!

The hotel receptionist greeted us when we arrived and he was very friendly and smiley. He was also very helpful, he gave us a map of Venice and talked us through the areas he thought would be of interest for us to visit as we told him it was our first time in Venice. He also told us which bus to get into lido centre and water taxi times, bus times etc so very helpful gentleman. Our room was a good size and everything we needed i.e extra pillows, bed covers, plenty towels, mini bar and plenty coat hangers in the wardrobe. We even had a small balcony.

We booked a standard double room directly on the hotel's own website for 75 euros a night which compared very well with Venice hotels even taking into consideration the cost of a travel pass. The hotel is literally 20 minutes from St. Mark's Square. The vaperetto number 1 runs every 10 minutes and there is always a bus waiting at the boat station ready to board for the 5 minute bus ride to the hotel. From the bus stop there is a three minute walk. I had been concerned to read in a previous post that the hotel has been known to bump guests to another hotel. I, therefore, emailed the hotel a week before to make sure that this would not happen to us and was assured that our room would be available. And this was the case. However, on entering the room allocated (108), I was upset to find that the full length windows were frosted over so that it was not possible to see out. On opening the full length window/door, we found it opened out onto a 12 inch drop onto the street with no balcony or parapet. This meant that to open the window to see out gave an open invitation to anyone passing by to step up into the room. With the windows completed frosted over and it not being safe to open them, this had the effect of being in a windowless room. I immediately returned to reception to ask to change rooms, but was told that all the rooms had been allocated and it was not possible to change. However, the receptionist said that a large group would be checking out the next morning and promised to move us then. At 8.00 a.m. the next morning, we spoke to the new receptionist on duty who had already been notified by his colleague and promised to move our luggage to a room on the third floor with a balcony later that day. When we returned to the hotel late that night, this had been done. The new room was much better with proper windows and a balcony. I mention this to first of all alert people to the fact that of the 26 rooms in the hotel, two or three at the front of the hotel on the lower floor, are rooms which do not have propery functioning windows - i.e. that you can see out of and open. However, the rest of the rooms in the hotel are good. The bedrooms have modern decor, comfortable beds and are very clean. The common areas - reception and bar/dining room are also quite stylish and comfortable. Breakfast is nothing to look forward to. As far as the hot food stored in a bain marie is concerned, it is better not even to open the lid. There is, however, a good supply of cereal, rolls, jam, cheese, ham, crossants and yoghurt. The butter seemed to be rancid, but there is also butter substitute. There is also plenty of coffee and tea, but the coffee was horrible and appeared to be instant (!). The reception staff were very pleasant and helpful. When we had difficulty understanding how the air-conditioning worked a maintenance man was sent up to us without delay. The locality is quite pleasant and safe. It is a quiet hotel at night. There is a good restaurant just three minutes walk away called Tiziano, but there is more choice of restaurants near to the boat station. Unlike a previous reviewer, I did not find the beach 'way ugly'. I thought it was a pleasant beach and enjoyed walking a good way along it. The sea is a little murky, but we are Irish and used to this. In fact this part of the Adriatic reminded me of a warm version of the Irish Sea. All in all, this hotel is good value for money if you can get the sort of price that we paid.", "Date": "October 2, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cPerfect petit palais........\u201d", "Author": "minnie061", "ReviewID": "UR70745787", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 day break staying at the Petit Palais. Had a wonderful time. Hotel was clean and modern and we opted for a superior sea view room which was a very large room with beautiful views. I can't really complain about with this hotel, it is what it says it is on the website. The room and view pictures are exactly as the photos on their website. There is no showever curtain in the bathroom so you can accidentally manage to make puddles on the bathroom floor. There is a basic self service breakfast with something for everyone. It is situated on the beach, but as someone else said, the beach is exclusive to the Excelsior Hotel. However, 20 metres to the right is a public beach. There is no restaurant for dinner and lunch but there are quite a few little restaurants and cafes on the main street of the island, 5 mins by bus, also many cafes/restaurants along the stretch of the beach where you can also hire beds and parasols. Staff were wonderful and extremely accommodating. All were polite and not without a smile. Gianluca, who worked mainly the morning and day shifts was especially nice. He was very helpful and fixed any problems that we had immediately. We bought a 72hr waterboat travel card which meant we could travel to the other main Venice Islands and back again at any time, allowing us to sightsee and then return to Venice Lido to get away from all the hustle and bustle. The main Venice Islands were heaving and you need to navigate through the back streets to find Venetian taverns to avoid a sea of tourists.

I think it had maybe 15 rooms. It was very modern and ECO friendly. It sits on the beach so you can walk on the sand and then sit in your back patio. Not all the rooms have patios. We were on the 1st floor in room 103. The two complaints I have are that there was only a tub in our room and no shower. We did have a hand-held shower handle but absolutely no curtains so needless to say the floor and everything in the bathroom got soaked. If you need a blow dryer, buy an inexpensive one in Italy because you will be dissapointed with the one at this hotel. It blows hot air but is very low and you can't control the setting or the direction of the air. The other negative is that the key to your room controls the electricity and the air conditioning. So when you leave and take your key with you, the room gets dark and the air shuts off. I'm sure it's an ECO thing but very frustrating if you are coming and going at different times than your roomate. They didn't even offer an extra key! Breakfast was just okay. Very continental. Runny eggs and overly strong coffee. This hotel is not anywhere near Venice. If you are looking for an exciting place on Venice, stay on Venice.

Rooms: Very big and elegant. Though bathroom was really small. Had a normal room (not with ocean view), facing the main road but was still quite silent. Location: The hotel is on the beach side of the Lido. If you don't have a car, then you can easily move with public buses (there were 3 lines, all bringing you in 5 minutes to the port). The beach is nice, with golden sand and the sea is quite clean (better than Iesolo, Caorle and any other place on the Riviera Adriatica) . The only bad thing is that it belongs to the Hotel Westin Excelsior (5 star) which does not allow you to borrow sunbeds at their \u00e2\u20ac\u0153lido\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. So if you want to have comfortable beach life, you would have to move forward, towards other lidos like MIRAMARE and so on (price approx. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 25 in 2 pax/day). The building looked nicer from the pictures on the web site actually, it had no big entrance and was not very visible on the road. Though it is located just 100 mts from the Cinema Palace, where the Festival takes place. Hall & breakfast: the hotel hall was very nice and clean and breakfast was quite rich (eggs, bacon, bread, toasts, ham, cheese, yoghurt, jams, fruit and good selection of Italian cakes and bakery). Venice: This 4 star hotel offers good money value if you want to stay in a nice place near Venice (we payed \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 270 for 2 night through booking.com) while enjoying the beach. (in case you are not willing to swim, then you could choose one of the hotels located right at the port \u00e2\u20ac\u201c hotel PANORAMA \u00e2\u20ac\u201c even cheaper). From the port the vaporetto's would bring you to S. Marco o Rialto in 10 minutes lagoon ride. That was a great choice! With good price and short ride you could easily get to crowded Venice, which is far more expensive. Same thing in the evening. After spending dinner in Venice you could easily get back to the quite Lido. (vaporettos every 5 minutes at all time) The ticket is though expensive (\u00e2\u201a\u00ac 6,50/ride). So it would be worth to buy the 24 or 48 hours ticket (approx. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 15 - \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 25/person). While would not recommend staying in Lido, there's not much life and no special shops or restaurants. (if you go to Venice, then must try \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Trattoria della RIVETTA\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, located in the streets on the east side of S. Marco. Casual and cheap place with great Italian specialities (spaghetti vongole, parmigiana melanzane, grilled and fried fish \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in 2 approx. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac 60!)
