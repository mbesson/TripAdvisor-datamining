This hotel is a sham and the people who work here are disgustingly greedy and borderline insane. We came here planning to stay here for a fun weekend trip to Montreal. When we got there some woman who claimed she did not work there but was \"filling in\" was manning the desk. She then proceeded to explain that something was \"wrong\" with the card when they ran it that morning and there were no rooms available anymore. Two questions: (1) Does anyone know of a hotel who randomly runs your card without authorization and (2) Does anyone know of a hotel who pretends there are issues with the card - neglects to inform the booking agent or the customer- and then gives away the room. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the card and the hotel simply made this up as an excuse for purposefully overbooking. Beyond this, the hotel manager yelled at both the booking agent and myself and my husband (while laughing and mocking us) for the entirety of the situation. The hotel is not clean, the location is not good at all; in fact we saw what looked like dirt and blood stains on the floor of the breakfast room. Regarding the location, I am not sure what people are basing their location preferences on but in Montreal you want to be close to St. Catherine street, Crescent Street or Latin Quarter, this hotel is pretty much in the middle of downtown where there is nothing around. The area seems deserted and pretty unsafe. The taxi driver even said not to stay there. Just please do not stay here, if you have any value on customer service, I believe that the members of TripAdvisor need to stand together and demand that we are treated with respect and not support establishments such as this one. In fact, I will be filing a formal complaint with the equivalent of the better business bureau and the hotel governing agency in Quebec, so quite frankly not sure how long this place will be around if they continue.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Majorca, Spain", "Title": "\u201cWas tolerable but one employee was great\u201d", "Author": "Maria B", "ReviewID": "UR117477668", "Content": "Hotel was below average small out dated rooms however one employee named Guilliana was great made us feel welcomed and was extremely courteous.

Still, there was a fridge, a TV, and reliable wireless. Breakfast each day was: black tea or coffee, orange juice, and the choice between a croissant or a chocolate chip or blueberry muffin. The muffins were gigantic and quite good, and there were several small tables in a small room off the front desk where you could sit and eat and look out onto the street. There was also a computer crammed into one corner, and things got pretty tight when three different pairs of people tried to eat at the same time one morning. Still, the man at the front desk was very nice, always said hello and goodbye, and never tried to gip us on money.

Anyways, we were quite nervous, but ended up really enjoying our stay. With the amount of money we saved we were able to do some more shopping.

The good side was the bed was clean, the tv works, the location is great (we walked everywhere the whole weekend) and the guy at the front desk was really friendly towards us.

All I told him is that I wanted a room with 1 bed for 3 nights and he showed us this tiny room with a queen size bed in the middle. The one night stand, one little lamp, a bar fridge, a bathroom and a TV, so we thought not bad and it's quiet. So we ask how much, he says in broken english 70$/night, I ask him about the sign outside, he that's a room with no bathroom. I was able to bargain with him, by telling him I was going to somewhere else, and I finally got the price down to 45$. So I book it. I start bringing the luggage in and I notice the bar fridge isn't plugged in, no big deal. But after dinner went we got back, we found out that it was hard to find parking, the A/C barely work, the shower was leaking, the phone line was cut and there was no TV. I tried to complain to the desk clerk but he was so rude because of his broken english, that he hid in his room. The next night I got a call for a family emergency, so I went to tell the desk clerk of this information, and that I'd like a refund for my 3rd night that I paid, he refuse, telling me that he didn't know how to do a refund on a credit card, and that it's 48 hours notice he needs... TOTAL BS, because he never said this info to me, NOR is it posted in the lobby, on the back of the receipt OR in the room. All he told me is to go to the aiport and they'll give me my money back. I call the aiport the next day on my way home, and the lady told me that the airport doesn't do hotel reimbursement and that I was had by him.

The next day (Thursday) we mentioned the late check out, to the girl with the french accent and she said it would be no problem. We went out and did our sightseeing and had a nice time. That Friday we went out to do some shopping, when we came back to drop off our bags to the room, the girl stopped us and said that we had to check out of the room, she said that they needed the room and she asked if the lady really said that we could have a late checkout. She said that the lady never said we could check out late, accusing us of lying. What would we have to gain from lying. That made us feel terrible, after we just had an enjoyable visit in Montreal. It left a bad taste in our mouth. If we could not have a late check out they could have told us that from the beginning so that we could make other arrangements. We had to pack up all of our things and take them to the car. Another sore spot was the parking, the lady (who had told us we could check out late) suddenly changed her tune. She said we had to pay the $10.00 for the parking and return the parking pass, because the man had to get paid for the parking, when clearly the parking pass was paid for the month of June. She then changed her mind and told us we could keep the parking pass until 3:00 pm if we gave her another $3.00, which we assume she quickly pocketed for herself. She offered to look after our bags until we came back but we had an uneasy feeling and we decided to put all our bags in our car. We agreed that for the price of the room, we got what we paid for, and $64.00 was not expensive, but it was misleading when the rate is advertised as much lower. It would be better if they had told us straight away what the price would be, we would gladly pay it. The room was basic, just a place to sleep and shower, although the towels could have been thicker, and a bath mat would have been nice, instead of the paper laid on the floor.
