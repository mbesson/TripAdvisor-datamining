The decor, ugly and worn, the amenities we had been promised over the booking website (no names, but they have since given us a refund - thankyou very much for your good service, you know who you are) were not there. We had no shampoo, toilet paper, shower curtain, hairdryer, in-room safe, soap, minibar or fridge of any kind, and we had to ask for towels at reception. We were generously offered as many handtowels as we wanted...yeah, handtowels. The room had random mirrors slapped up all over the place including two on the ceiling, and a framed picture literally the size of my hand, why even bother? The room had mold on the carpet as well as some sort of stain like chemicals had melted the pile. Mold also on the bathroom ceiling, and dust on the curtains. The wiring was exposed on the phone only power socket, and the only other way to get any electricity was to risk the grimy multiplug that was running the tv. The TV was a 14 inch CRT, with terrible reception on every channel, and no remote so we couldnt adjust the volume or try and retune it ourselves. The bathroom...imagine someone was putting in the shower and his mates brought up the toilet and sink, gave them to him and he installed them inside the shower stall. You dont need to imagine it, just stay in room 4 and see for yourself. If you want to use either the sink, or the toilet you need to stand to the side, neither one can be used from the front without some sort of gymnastic endeavour. So if youre a man, your options are to climb over the toilet and stand in the shower, or stand outside the bathroom, and fire into it hoping to strike the target. Ladies have the benefit of being able to brush their teeth at the same time they use the toilet, as the handbasin is literally jutting out over the knees as you sit. The door closes with no room to stand next to the toilet unless you climb over it to get into the bathroom. Theres no shower curtain, so at least the toilet gets a clean while you shower, as long as you dont mind standing in whatever is washing off it at the same time you are trying to get clean!! Then you can try not to break your leg as you clamber over the wet porcelain and back out of the bathroom. Others have mentioned in their reveiws of chemical smells and my girlfriend got so sick during the night from this, we nearly called an ambulance...this Scummy dive poisoned her! It was so cold we had to wear our clothes, there was no heating at all, and during the day the room was cooking because the window didnt open...marvellous. There are people on here saying you get what you pay for...thats just not the case here, you do not get a safe clean hotel room, you get a run down craphole with a door that barely locks, up flights of narrow stairs past piles of laundry that did not move the entire time we were there. You get signs of the giftshop that used to be in the foyer, but no giftshop. You get a breakfast you dont want to eat because it is prisonfood, actually no, prisoners are quite well fed from what I hear. We were offered bread and a toaster to D.I.Y. and a warming tray, with some scrambled eggs in one of three trays inside, the other two trays were missing, so I didnt even get to see how bad the rest of it would have been. The other positive reveiws would suggest this hotel is worthy of four or five stars??? So this place is equivalnt to the Dorchester, equivalent to Vegas's finest? This place that has cellotape holding the wallpaper onto the main staircase is rival to the Beverly hills Hilton?? NO it blimmen isnt, it is Ridiculous and disgusting, a fraud and a health risk, a shame and a disgrace and judging by these reveiws it has been that way since at least 2005.

We should have been prepared when we booked in and the receptionist told us that our towels would be available the following morning .... I can only guess that we had a room usually designated for casual staff and late-night drunks. It was so bad, we laughed - had no choice, really, as there were no other rooms free and the manager/owner was never 'available'. I could write my name in the dust on the windowsill, we failed to get any loo paper out of the locked dispenser, we froze in the unheated bath/shower room and separate toilet (ventilation was an uncovered hole in the wall leading to the outside). This room simply should not have been let - and it's not just that it needed refurbishment. All the public areas we saw were well in need of a good clean and redecoration, the linen was threadbare, and the hotel 'amenities' as advertised on the website simply were not there. There really is no excuse for a hotel in a city like Amsterdam to provide this quality of accommodation. It's nothing to do with 'value for money' as the cheapest backpacker hostels are better than this.

They offered us a basement room for the other 2. We looked at it and it was just a mattress on the ground, with no windows or even bathroom facilities. We asked instead for them to put bedding on the floor of the 2 person room, and we would cram into that room for the night (the next 3 nights we were moved to a 4 person room). This was quite annoying, and they did give us a discount for the inconvenience, but had it just been 2 of us with no alternative, we would have had to possibly sleep in the horrible basement! I asked the guy on the desk if it happened very often, and he said \"all the time\" and it was a \"major problem\". I have seen others mention the basement on here, so I would recommend contacting the hotel directly to make a booking - not through a 3rd party, to ensure this doesn't happen to you!", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cPicturesque on the outside, dissapointing on the inside!\u201d", "Author": "bibs74", "ReviewID": "UR60901310", "Content": "On first arrival to the Rembrandtplein Hotel in Amsterdam, you wlk up a lovely cobbled street with bridges over the canal to either side. The first appearance of the hotel looked lovely and welcoming and you flet pleased with your choice. On reception we were greeted by the owner who seemed nice enough and he gave us our keys and pointed us towards the stairs and said we were in room 14. This is where the nice part of the experience ended for us. What he didn't tell you whilst carrying a heavy bag was that room 14 was infact on the 5th floor of a 6 story hotel and that the stairs were steep and winding so making it more difficult to get up with lugguage etc. When we finally arrived on the 5th floor the arrowpointing towards our room was drawn on in marker as the arrow was missing so we made our way to the room. Once in the room I could not belive I had paid the money I did for it as there was peeling wall paper, no tolietries in the extremely small bathroom (the toilet was near enough in the shower and was only divided by a curtain), the carpet ran up the side of what I can only describe as a box with a mattress on top, and the carpet did not reach to the side of the room under the radiator, the carpet was filthy and heavily stained and looked like it hadn't been vacced in years let alone months, and there was a layer of mold on the bathroom door as there was no extractor fan for the steam. There was an electrical wire sticking out where i assume it once was. This hotel was only 100 yards from the Raddison and was very close to the main part of town yet they were literally worlds apart. This hotel was awarded a 2 star yet I would say it wasn't worthy of that, I have stayed in better B & B's in Blackpool and thats saying something. I wouldn't advise this hotel to anyone who likes cleanliness as that it did not have in any shape of form. However there were a couple of plus's to this. The night receptionist was friendly and welcoming and always happy to help when you returned from your trips/nights out, the continental breakfast was simple but adequate and there were maps and leaflets on things to do and how to get about in the reception area which did help. The moral of this is to stay out of this hotel as much as possible to avoid the horrendous stair climbing and the room in general or get drunk and try and forget where you are staying.

I have travelled a fair amount and have stayed at a range of hotels from luxury properties to hostels in my younger years. Never have I stayed in a hotel as filthy as the Rembrandtplein. Granted, the location is extremely convenient to all the sites of Amsterdam and is situated in a pretty canal with beautiful church bells ringing in the distance. However, I would never stay here again and strongly recommend others to stay away as well. We were travelling as a group of four and had originally requested two twin rooms. Upon arrival, we were given room 7 and our companions a room on the 3rd floor. Immediately upon leaving the reception it was clear that this hotel is in dire need of refurbishment. The condition of this hotel cannot be described as charming outside of it's architectural gems such as the breakfast room ceiling and steep staircase. Our friends requested another room immediately and after a second request were given room 18 which was larger and appeared to be somewhat cleaner than their original room. Our room looked over an internal courtyard - more like an air shaft. The ground was littered with various garbage including cigarette butts and unused tiles. Upon entering the room we were immediately shocked by the obvious filth in which we were staying. The bedspreads were stained and had cigarette burns, the carpet was equally stained and the ceiling was grey with dirt. Perhaps it was a blessing that half of the lighting was inoperable as it would have certainly revealed more of the room's dirt. The bathroom was even worse, the tub surround and ceiling covered in black mould. The tub itself was relatively clean but the ledge had obviously not been cleaned for some time. We finally took a shower our last day before departing for home and made the mistake of using the shower curtain to prevent water from splashing onto the small floor. Once the hot water and steam from the shower came into contact with the curtain I nearly gagged from the stench that arose. It was a mixture of urine and such dirt that the smell permeated the entire bathroom and even our room. The neighbouring room was occupied by a number of males and the marijuana smoke was so thick in the hallway it entered our room as well. The only thing that appeared to be clean were the sheets - we did not unpack and tried not to touch any of the other surfaces at all. Reception indicated that they clean daily and thoroughly but this is not the case at all - the lamp bases were obviously filthy and the wardrobe dusty as well. Breakfast was average at best. Orange juice, coffee and tea were accompanied by scrambled eggs (ok) and the saltiest most fat riddled bacon I have ever eaten. There was ham and cheese however, the cheese slices were obviously dried out indicating they were sitting there for a long time. Reception was friendly enough however, we asked for wake up calls both mornings and never received them. We ordered a taxi for the morning of departure and it was not ordered until we reminded them again and a call was made. This hotel was definitely not worth the 75 Euro we paid per night. Due to the fact that we were staying only two nights we did not want the hassle of finding other accommodation but I would never stay again - not even for one night.

On arrival the booking fee of 3% was due plus an 8% charge for tourist tax in Amsterdam (this was the first i'd heard to these taxes as the website i had used when boking expressly stated that there was no booking fee). Then the bathroom stank of bleach so much that i gagged when i tried to pee. There was no toilet paper supplied and i had to insist that the reception staff give me toilet paper, while they repeated over and over that the cleaner had left some in the room if i cared to look. The location, while good isn't great. Leidesplein is a much nicer friendly area with a lot more life and much more to do around the area. The pillow cases had blood stains. The towels weren't replaced by clean ones during their \"room clean\", nor was the bed made. The top blanket was pulled up over everything. So when we pulled back the blanket the bed was still a mess. What i didn;t understand was why bother? Why bother pulling the blanket up on the bed when they aren't going to make it or replace the towels? That made me very uncomfortable, these people had been in our room with our possessions and hadn't even cleaned up... Very Weird! DO NOT STAY HERE, if you are really really desperate (now really desperate, and willing to pay more than the quoted price) and you have no where else to go, then please DO NOT leave any valuables around. These people are unhelpful, unfriendly, unappproachable and sneaky. Oh, and make sure you bring somrthing to stand on in the shower because it is disgusting. Plus side: the water pressure in the shower was good and the TV worked. And the mirrors do make the place look cleaner than you think. Each morning we were woken by church bells, if that's your thing.", "Date": "May 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4112617", "Content": "We booked this through A1 Discount Hotels on the net.

The breakfast was OK with eggs, cheese, ham and toast available with juices and coffee or tea and was available from 8AM to 11AM which was good if you had a night on the town and did not want to get up too early.

And look at how tiny the room is; I can't even stand up without banging my head on the eaves.\" I shouldn't have to ask for towels like it's a privilege. The hotel has a quirky feel, like it was renovated from some other use. Steep, crooked stairs that give the place a very old school feel. The bathroom is literally a toilet, a shower head and a drain in the middle of the floor, and I was even OK with that. The neighborhood is quiet but very centrally located. Location is the best feature of the hotel. Overall, I was able to adapt to everything since I had the bare necessities.

On arrival late afternoon we were told by the receptionist that there were only 3 rooms available and for one night only. When a copy of the emailed booking was shown we were told that there were still no rooms available and we asked to speak with the manager who would not come to reception but told the tearful receptionist to sort it. Eventually she managed to find 6 rooms which we kept for the whole weekend but watched when other visitors were turned away, equally having booked rooms.One couple from our party had to find alternative accommodation elsewhere (approx. 25mins away) and we received no apology for this. When settling the bill at the end of the weekend, one of the party who had booked a single room was charged for a double (she took the double because she did not want to be somewhere else on her own and her single room was not available). The hotel was definitely a 2 star with some rooms disgustingly dirty, well worn and like prison cells in some cases. Breakfasts were very basic and cleanliness was not a priority anywhere in the hotel apart from the reception! Would not recommend this hotel to anyone and if a booking has been made I would definitely go through an agent rather than the hotel direct as at least you have some chance of a refund or alternative accommodation if (or when) they overbook which seems to be the norm here.", "Date": "October 27, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "ATHENS", "Title": "\u201cDisgrace for the City of Amsterdam\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3768446", "Content": "Booked one of the cheap rooms through Internet.

The room was full of mirrors, not only on the sides but on the ceilings in the shape of the letter V. It seems that Rembrandtplein was a brothel before.

The hotel gives the impression of being haunted with malfunctions in the doors and reflections from all the mirrors and the 1300 feeling. The stairs are steep. The restaurant seemed to be a fancy restaurant in better years, now is a confy caffeteria for the breakfast that was not bad at all considering the price.

One couple had to leave immediately to find another hotel as their room was extremely hot (no exaggeration) because the heater was on, could not be turned off and windows were impossible to open. Additionally cigarette smoke leaked from the neighboring room underneath their door. The other couple were content with their room. In our room, both two radiators were hot. I managed to shut off one but the other was totally stuck. We asked the reception several times for help but nothing happened.The first night was terrible because of the heat. On the next day we had to \"discuss\" quite intensely with the receptionist to change rooms but finally we got another room which turned out to be a lot better. However, returning from dinner late on the last evening, it turned out somebody had kicked in the door to our room, stealing, among others a laptop PC that I had kept hidden in my suitcase at all times. Only our room had been broken into. Did somebody know beforehand that I had my PC with me, stowed away deep down in my suitcase? I don't know... There are no safes in the rooms. It is possible to store valuables in the reception they told us - afterwards... The manager told us that two weeks ago exact the same thing had happened; the doors to three rooms had been kicked in by unknown burglars. So far he has accepted no responsibility for our loss.

The location is central and the area is quiet with no traffic noise. It is a small hotel with 15 rooms. You might find this hotel OK if you get one of the good rooms.

There were two single beds, one six inches lower than the other, as it had had it's legs removed so it would fit under the eaves! There was a desk with tv on and a tiny wardrobe which had no means of hanging anything up. The sheets were clean but the breadspreads were covered in hairs and cigarette burns. The bathroom was a typical Dutch bathroom where the shower and tiolet are in the same cubicle but there wan't even a curtain and the toilet paper got wet when we had a shower. I had also emailed before we went and was told there was a hairdryer in the room - there was no sign of one.
