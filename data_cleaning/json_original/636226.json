The actual room was so small you couldn't even swing a cat in it. Husband had to sit back on bed if I wanted to pass. Bathroom smelt of sewarage. Recemented our ceiling whilst we were staying and no shower curtain. In the hotel leaflet/city map, our room was advertised as a Single room and a double (with twin beds) was called a double. Confused!!! Charged for a double room. Breakfast was boring - powdered orange juice and instant coffee and coffee mate - disappointing. Lost all enthusiasm to eat. No variation in food either. The air conditioning case was above our heads over the bed so it was very draughty. Duvet on - too hot, duvet off too cold because of A/C. I will mention that the actual bed and pillows were very comfortable.", "Date": "October 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Southport, Australia", "Title": "\u201cThe hotel has bad attitude\u201d", "Author": "malcolm16", "ReviewID": "UR119093134", "Content": "The room is just big enough for 2 and a bag.

The location in Kumpkapi is good as it's off the main tourist drag in Sultanahmet and near some good fish restaurants. The bedrooms are small, but we were only there to sleep so not a problem. The bathroom was small but clean and serviceable, good shower. Breakfast on the roof terrace was lovely, though air conditioning unit completely inadequate so advise going up for breakfast before it gets hot outside if visiting in summer. Lovely views from breakfast terrace. Breakfast was ok, average Turkish breakfast, though eggs were always hardboiled and black so we avoided. Staff was OK but not particularly friendly.
