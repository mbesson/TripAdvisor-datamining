Despite its location, where two of the busiest avenues converge, the hotel is extremely quiet. The entire staff are extremely courteous and seem very knowledgable. At all times, there was somebody willing to assist with a big smile. The front desk staff, bell boys, room service and restaurant staff, they all where fantastic, met every one of our very demanding needs and treated our children like super stars. The food is very good and reasonable priced for a hotel. We never had to ask twice for things to happen, it seems that the GM has a very well organized and trained team. Kudos to all!", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Buenos Aires", "Title": "\u201cFair hotel, just a place to sleep for business travellers\u201d", "Author": "Luz1980", "ReviewID": "UR63431462", "Content": "The Fiesta Inn Insurgentes Viaducto is an OK hotel if you plan on just having a place to sleep at night after a long day and have breakfast before heading on to a full day of meetings or business events. It\u00b4s fairly well located if you\u00b4re doing business around the WTC, and just a short stroll away from the Metro and Metrobus stations. The rooms are average and have wireless internet, which is good. I didn\u00b4t like the bed too much, since one night I found the sheets had holes, and the bed comforter and comforter pillows looked kind of dirty or at least worn out. The big issue for me was the bathtub: it was small and not very deep, and half the time the hot water came out warm instead of hot. This may sound high maintenance to some people, but i\u00b4m sure it won\u00b4t to people who rely on a comfortable bath to relax sore muscles after a long day, like myself. Plus, the bathroom itself was very small, and once you got into the tub you had a nice and detailed view of the toilet bowl right next to you. Taking a bath was kind of depressing. Also, on the first day, the shower didn\u00b4t work, so I had to wash my hair with the water from the \"bottom tap\", and have my hair sucked down the drain until I could eventually stop the sucking and save my hair from being damaged and cut. In the mornings, the housekeeping staff is very loud, even on Sundays and Saturdays, so if you plan on getting some quality sleep after 7am, this is not the place. Plus, there\u00b4s no alarm clock, so there\u00b4s always the fear of not getting the wake up call and oversleeping. Not what you\u00b4d expect at a business hotel. Last, but not least, if you are planning on making reservations at this Hotel, make sure they don\u00b4t put you in one of the rooms that look into the internal foyer, to make sure you can be on a room that actually gets some daylight. I could never know if it was cold, warm, sunny or raining outside, the internal rooms don\u00b4t get ANY daylight at all. Other than that, the staff was nice and helpful, and the breakfast food was fine. The Room service was the only not-so-good part, since it took them forever to get your meal, and it always arrived cold.", "Date": "May 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford", "Title": "\u201cHad our booking but no rooms!\u201d", "Author": "Off-piste_Oxford", "ReviewID": "UR22738575", "Content": "This hotel took our booking 2 months in advance, but when we arrived, they would not give us rooms. (Even though, as they admitted, the booking was still valid.) It was 10:30 at night, and we were exhausted after long flights from abroad. During the subsequent hour of discussion and attempted negotiation, the front desk kept insisting that we stay instead at a particular cheap hotel around the corner, and they refused to let us speak with their boss. In the end, we just left. (After a bit of searching, we did find a good - although expensive - hotel in the Centro Historico district.)

Fiesta Inn is a large Mexican hotel chain, hence it may be less well known by those outside the country. This high-rise property is close to a major highway and near the neighborhood of Condesa/Roma. Ride to airport without much traffic is 30 minutes. Service/check-in was good for the duration of stay. Despite proximity to highway, hotel appeared quiet. Hotel is a modern style,, open just over 1 year, rooms decent size, in good condition, though furnishing somewhat sparse (first hotel without a clock/radio in it), bedding hard but in good condition. Bathrooms are fairly small. Not much is located nearby to this hotel in terms of restaurants (Condesa area is about a 15 min walk). Staff friendly and spoke good English.
