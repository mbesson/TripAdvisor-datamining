THE MOST HORRIBLE THING WAS, what they call \"house keeper\" opened our door after we told her NOT TO COME IN and she still opened the door while we were undressed. We were so angry ! When I gave back the key I told at the front desk all about the situation and room condition and that I am going to leave a very bad feedback about the hotel and the very poor house keeping service.

The odd thing is, when I checked out at 10:00 am the next day, I had to wait in line behind 2 other parties checking in. So they could check in way early, & I had to wait. When I parked my car, a guy was blowing leaves & dirt in an effort to clean the parking lot, right at me & my car. This was typical rudeness of the motel's staff. The shower had no pressure, the towels had more starch than fabric, and there was no clock nor radio to awaken by. The place needs a major renovation. I saw a kid in the jacuzzi, with his parents watching from neaby chairs. I was agasp because I could smell the bacteria & see the clumps of foam. After they got out & the bubbles stopped, it was pure green. There were lots of rules in the lobby, & they make you sign a form saying you will abide by the rules. It is apparent (perhaps from the early morning check-ins), that the place may double as a house of prostitution. I know there was a prositute standing in front of the motel - trying at attract my attention (good luck, I'm gay!).

I had asked for a non-smoking room but the room reeked of stale smoke (esp. the bathroom). Someone had carved grafitti into the inside of the door and the screens on my window were broken. THere were stains on the cieling and obvious red wine stains scrubbed out of the bathroom counter. The linen really stank of cigerette smoke as well and the bed was pretty stiff. I was a bit nervous by the neighborhood, but basically it was a quiet night and no one bothered me. I got into my hotel at midnight. There was a security staff patrolling the parking lot at night, but that actually made me feel better about staying there. They were nice enough.

I believe our hotel was priced at $50 after all of the taxes and I know the adage of you get what you pay for.

I went downstairs to asked to be moved to the other side of the hotel and the guy at the front desk accomodated that. After moving to a new room my girlfriend said the smell was overwhelming her so I walked to the mini mart and bought a pine tree car air freshener and some spray. We had reservations for three nights but left after two nights. If you need a place to stay for cheap (which we did) it is okay.

Visited front desk to request plunger and were told we were out of luck - no plunger and no alternate bathroom to use. Told them this was unacceptable and our bladders were about to burst in the front lobby. Finally, they relented and said we could use the toilet in a room on the other side of the complex.
