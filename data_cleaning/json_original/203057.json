I stayed in a single room so expected small just not that tiny. Bathroom however was big. The hotel was nice but just not as grand or as amazing as the photos you see on internet sites. My room definitely did not look like any of the photos. But reading other peoples reviews it seems that certain areas of the hotel may be nicer, ie nicer room.

The service was terrible with rude receptionists, and you have to pay 2 euros for 30 min of internet time. The only positive thing I can say about the hotel is the location, it's close enough to the train station \"Ottaviano\" and to the Vatican (and a tip for those who want to visit the Vatican, there are ticket sellers everywhere outside the long line into the Vatican, they require 25 euros for a ticket but they only paid about 15 euros for it and I recommend standing in line instead of buying a ticket from them because you still have to wait in line to get in anyway.

Some better establishments may offer a buffet with fruit, cereals, cheese and cold ham. A few times we've seen cooked eggs on offer, for an extra charge. If you stay in as many Italian hotels as we have, you dread the sight of the revolting sweetened watered-down orange juice invariably served, even at smart establishments, and the hideous 'fette biscottate': dried crunchy toast-like slices wrapped in cellophane. If you read hotel reviews, you'll see that foreign visitors almost always complain about the breakfasts served. We'd recommend you console yourself with the thought that you are paying less (no chefs cooking up eggs and bacon) and stop off at a bar to fill up on fresh pastries if you're still hungry.

The rooms, although small, were similar to a European 3-star hotel, not bad but nothing really to brag about. There is a bar where we watched some World Cup matches and I liked it. We stayed 4 nights which was too many and we ended up with some sleep deprivation issues due to the outside noise (and we were on the 3rd floor!!). The beds were very small but fairly firm.

The staff was friendly and we had no complaints up until it was time for us to pack and leave. During the time we were there, we did not want to travel with all of our documents in the event my purse was snatched or something. The safe was not securing well, so we decided to walk with our passports and leave our wallet and one cell phone in the room tightly hidden away in our suitcase in the closet. While packing the night before our departure, we noticed the wallet and phone were missing. We looked everywhere, ransacked the room over and over, search dirty clothing, under the beds, everywhere. Our only conclusion was that the cleaning person took our belongings. We had no proof of this; however we knew exactly where we had put our documents (credit cards, ATM cards, driver\u2019s license, student ID card, and military ID cards etc.) This was frustrating because now we had to cancel all credit cards, debit cards and cell phone. We also had to call long distance on my cell phone because the hotel desk phone would not allow us to dial to the states. We called the police to file a report and they would not come to the hotel because it was late, so now we had to walk five blocks to the police station to make a report. Thanks to one of the guest who was on business from Barcelona, helped us throughout this ordeal, he even allowed us to drive in his taxi the next day to the airport. Needless to say, the hotel was not much help and did not even seem to be concerned. We called the Manger who was out at the time and explained what happened, she told us to give them the police report and we will get the money back for our phone and that was all they could do. We are still waiting to see if they will actually give us our money for the phone. Rome was definitely beautiful and we would do it again, but will not stay in this hotel. I know sometimes one cannot control what employees do, however for the hotel not to show any concerned was really disappointing. Another thing I found interesting was the fact that the front desk clerk knew what we had taken out of the room refrigerator without us even telling him. At the time of check out, the desk clerk told me exactly what I had owed him for from the fridge; I did not even fill out the form with the items. That was a mystery to me. I f you want to stay in this hotel, I would think twice because you never know when someone will actually take the time and effort to go into your room, into a closet and into a suitcase to steal your belongings, and to have a manger who shows no concern what so ever.

The hotel is ideally located for all the tourist areas of Rome, particularly the Vatican which is 5 minutes walk just around the corner. The basic structure of the building is very nice, with marble floors and high ceilings. The carpets, curtains and internal furnishings of the corridors and bedrooms are however, a little tired. There are nice touches in service, the sheets and towels are all renewed every day. There was an electric powered shutter on the outside of our bedroom window, and I'm sure if it had worked properly it would have made our room nice and dark for that relaxing lie-in. No tea or coffee making equipment is provided in the room, though there is a mini-bar. I appreciate that buying from the mini-bar is often expensive, but we were charged an extortionate 12 euros (about \u00a38 or $16) for a small bottle of water (500ml). Far better to buy from the small shop at the market entrance opposite the hotel, where you can get 1 ltr for only 1 euro. Bedrooms are small but clean, as are the even smaller bathrooms, though the tiles were cracked, as was the tray of the shower cubicle. Don't expect nicities like complimentary shower gel, shampoos or shower cap etc.....take everything you may possibly need. Staff are pleasant and usually helpful. Breakfast is provided as a continental buffet in the basement between 7 and 10am every day. I advise anyone to go early, or late, as the peak time between 8 and 9am you'll do well to get a table. There simply aren't enough for the number of people staying there. On the whole the hotel was adequate for our needs. If you can manage to get a cheap 'deal' then the hotel would be good value. The location, the structure of the building, and the service of most of the staff give this hotel the possibility of being somewhere special to go and stay in Rome.

Breakfast was basic, and the hot water machine broke while one of us was using it and boiling hot water poured out of the tap narrowly missing her hands.The rooms were clean and so were the bedsheets, and the bathroom again was clean and well fitted with a powerful shower, But the service we had from the staff in this hotel was dreadful, the barstaff in particular, We had to check out of the hotel at 11.00am, but our flight wasnt until the evening, so while we were waiting for our taxi we decided to have a drink at the bar, After ordering our drinks we were told that he had no change to go and ask the receptionist for change, who then threw the change at us over the reception desk, when we took the change back to the barman, he became abusive saying when are you going back to england, not soon enough, he then phoned another collegue in the hotel and spoke to him presumably about us in italian, the porter whom he was speaking to then came in to the bar and sprayed excessive air freshener right in our direction making us cough, and then him and his friend the barman fell about laughing, we felt insinuating that something smelt bad in the bar. This man was so rude i was unable to stay in the hotel bar any longer and preferred to stand outside in the cold. Rome was a beautiful city and the location was fantastic.

They should think about having the furniture in the downstairs lounge reupholstered as there doesn't seem to be any springs left and offer European as well as awfull American style (I am American, this is expresso with water Ecch) coffee.

The biggest surprise was seeing the hotel as it didn't look anything like the pictures on the web - they've certainly been artistic with their publicity material. Our trip was taken shortly after the death of the Pope and the city was swarming with journalists. I presume this was the reason the staff tried to palm us off with staff quarters in the basement!! I guess they were hoping to get a much better rate for our room. We had to complain 3 times to get moved. We were offered no explanation for the state of windowless room we were shown to in the basement. It was only after complaining that we were told the hotel was fully booked and they would \"move us tomorrow\", as the hotel was full. We were only there for 3 nights, and after consideration complained again. We were assured the hotel was completely full. After going out for dinner, we asked to see the manager. We hung around for 20 mins waiting for him to appear and then witnessed a full blown Italian row in the manager's office as he yelled at his staff and refused to see us!! We were however moved by another member of staff to an empty, adequate room, that was mysteriously available, while the arguement continued. The hotel is situated in a good area of Rome, with several good places to eat close by which is lucky because the breakfast is very poor and after the first morning we chose to give it a miss and eat breakfast out.

This hotel is really of average 3 star rating, certainly not a four star. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.

The location of the hotel was great. It was literally around the corner from the Vatican and a few blocks from a Metro station.

When we arrived, there was nothing but sheets on the bed, no blanket, no comforter. We found a blanket in one of the cabinets in the room. We slept in our clothes on top of the blanket. The walls were dirty and the room smelled as if it had been closed for months possibly years. The shower door was broken so it was impossible to take a shower with the door closed. Which turned out to be fine because I didn't want the shower door to touch any parts of my body. When my husband went downstairs to complain, the clerk at the front desk told us there was no availiablity to switch us to another room and that we would have to endure this slum called a hotel room for the remainder of our stay. Fortunately for us we were only in Rome two nights. Our initial thought was that all of the rooms were as yucky as this one. However, the next morning on our way to breakfast we were able to peek into some of the other rooms. Other rooms didn't seem as bad but that was just an initial glance. The breakfast leaves a lot to be desired as well.

Good points: room was quiet at night, air con worked fine but a little noisy. Maid did a good job cleaning the room and the people on desk were polite. Having read the other reviews on this site I can contribute the consensus of the tiny shower and undrinkable coffee. There was not enough room to swing a mouse in the shower, let alone a cat. The hot water was fine. The cistern on the toilet took forever to fill up (well it is the eternal city!). My main moan was the breakfast. Coffee tasted like gravy, quality of the food was poor. I ended up going to a nearby bar and having a coffee/sandwich. While the hotel is near the Vatican, it is about a mile (25 minute walk) to the historic centre. The metro doesn't go every where and it is advisable to find bus and tram routes, as they pass close to the hotel. There are some nearby resturants in the streets around the hotel that are good value and plenty of shops. This was a budget option and from what I had read about other hotels in the same price category it isn't bad.

It is rated 4 star, but of course in U.S. it would never rate as high...kinda looks like an old motel inside. But is clean. There is a \"center\" corridor to the hotel, which is what our room faced, so we looked at a wall - so if you want a view, try requesting at the desk....it was no biggie to us as we were out all day. Air worked well in our room. The rest of the hotel was warm. Our room was about the same size as a normal hotel room, so not small. Bathroom big but the shower was tiny..had to shower w/the curtain open to make for more room....You have to be open minded as these things are expected as most structures in Rome are old. Didn't check out the hotel bar. Took a glance at the breakfast, but didn't try anything except a cup of coffee - coffee no good - I think it's the \"Guiness\" of coffees. Go right across the street to the market (mercado). Right when you walk inside there is a little cafe/bar - they have good coffee/cappucino for like .90 euro (about $1 american), plus they have little sandwiches for cheap. There's a cool bus tour called \"Open110\" or something like that with a red double decker bus.....they'll give you the info at the front desk. It's maybe 30 euro full day/13 for half the day and you can get on and off the bus whenever you want - as there buses goes round and round the city till about 9pm. You get to see all the spots.
