The room was cute and clean, and the hotel was near everything. It was an easy 10-minute walk from the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia and about two blocks from a number of restaurants. I also really liked the rooftop terrace with a view of the sea, and there was a good spread at breakfast and nice little outdoor grotto in which to eat it. I also liked that there was a safe in the room. Now, obviously, this is a budget hotel, so don't expect a Marriott or Hyatt or Ritz. The rooms, as in most budget hotels, are small, but they're nice, and the bathroom was clean, cute and totally functional. It was an EXCELLENT value for the money, and I honestly can't think of one complaint. It exceeded my expectations for a budget hotel, and I would definitely stay here again. One note, though, I would definitely recommend taking a cab from the airport as opposed to public transportation, but I think that applies to almost any hotel in this area, as the streets can be a bit confusing. My husband and I usually try to take public transportation to save money, but we took cabs to and from Sphendon and considered it the best money ($25/$30 each way) we spent.", "Date": "October 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cENDED UP HERE BY DEFAULT!\u201d", "Author": "fatih2011", "ReviewID": "UR119137356", "Content": "I was given the option to stay here by Al Mina hotel.

We chose this hotel based on the Trip Advisor reviews and we were quite happy with them. The hotel was really nicely decorated, very clean and the staff was very friendly. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a restored old house, so the room was a bit small, but that was what we expected anyway. The room had a facility we really appreciated\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a kettle & a selection of tea/coffee. (And I fell in love with the lamp in the room\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6) We wished there were more fruits for breakfast since my husband\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s diet was somewhat restricted (no salty food, no dairy & no preserved meat \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which left him with only toast & jam). But if you are not picky, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plenty to eat. I enjoyed cheese, pickles and pastries. We were given the room just above the reception facing the street, so the brief but loud noises from outside (carts going up and down the cobbled street, shout from the vegetable seller, truck loaded with gas bottles, etc.) was quit overwhelming from time to time. If you are out all day visiting places, these daytime noises wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be a problem for you. We just like to break the day in half and like to have a nap in the afternoon, so\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 If you are like us who enjoy your little afternoon sleep, we definitely recommend booking a room facing the courtyard. The staircase was a bit noisy as well. Again, this is a restored old house, so it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s understandable. The hotel is located in the residential area off the main street, only a short walk to the Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace and the busy area of Sultanahmet. The streets are quite dark in the night, but you wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel threatened. We felt absolutely safe walking around the surrounding streets after dark. By the way, the hotel has very efficient heating system.
