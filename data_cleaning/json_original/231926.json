My boyfriend and I visited the city to celebrate my 30th birthday and unforturnately, despite the research, the hotel really let us down. The main issues - really noisy room, including cleaners vaccuming and cleaning the rooms (while loudly banging the doors frequently as they go in and out) at midnight! A pain to get to, and overpriced for what you get. Plus staff who are really unhelpful for tourist info and ideas. And really slow, rubbish internet 6 euros an hour. One of the best things about going on holiday is not having to get up early. So if you do plan to stay here (although I would strongly recommend finding somewhere else), when you arrive, if they offer you room 20 or 30, ask for another room. Unless you plan to get up before 7am every day. As this room was the noisiest I have ever stayed in. What we weren't told when we arrived is that the room is right next door to the breakfast room, so you will be woken every morning by the horrendous screeching and scraping of chairs on the floor from 7 till 10. You can feel the vibrations in the bed it's that close! They also decided to clean the room next door one night at midnight, including vacuuming and going in and out frequently letting the door slam, while talking loudly right outside our bedroom door, with no regard for us. Awful, awful behaviour. The location is rubbish. Unless you like very long walks, you will need to get the metro to Flaminio then a tram for three stops to Ankara. It's just a pain, as there are thousands of hotels in the centre itself, it's really annoying to be that far out. I also found the staff unhelpful when it came to tourist info. We wanted some ideas for something amazing to do on my actual birthday. But the only things the staff could suggest were a night tour of the city, and an opera (which wasn't even on during our stay!) I know they must get commission for these two activities, but that is very poor. I refuse to believe there are no other options! The night tour is 70 euros per person, completely overpriced. It includes a meal, but we ate in a lovely restaurant called Biga right next to the Colosseum, with main meals, wine and side dishes for two, for a total of 30euros. The tour doesn't even take you in to the sites, so it is basically a very costly bus/taxi round. We would not stay here again and would recommend finding somewhere nearer the centre.

I traveled on my own, so I booked a single room. Personally I'm the type of traveller that I want my hotel to be just a place to sleep well after a tiring day visiting all the sights around (each) city. I'm here to tell you that Villa Glori is ready to offer you much more than this. First of all, as I have already told, I ordered a single room, and that's i got of course. But, it was a single room with a double bed. I don't know if this is common experience for others, but I saw this happening for the first time. It's great to see after all that there are still people who care about their customers and give them special treatment. Furthermore, the hotel stuff except for being professional, proved to be amazingly polite. It was the most polite stuff I've ever met at a hotel. They will surely steal your heart with their behaviour. My room, room 50, was very clean, roomy, really functional, and had everything I needed to feel comfortable and honestly, almost like home.Nice design, modern furniture, everything great. The only average thing in the room was the TV, although you may watch a variety of channels, coming from many different countries, including CNN, BBC, Eurosport, etc. After all these, there is no need to refer to the sleep quality-It's expected to say that I was really satisfied. Quiet hotel, great matress-pilow combination. Better than what I have at home-and that's what you expect when you stay at a hotel. The hotel's value is exactly what you expect from a 4 star hotel. Nothing more, nothing less. The only thing that was not as good as I expected, was the location of the hotel. Well, I have to say that I'm very demanding in this matter-I want a metro station just outside of the hotel's door, if possible. The location is not bad, but it's not amazing either. The hotel is located near a tram station, which averagaly passes by every 5-7 minutes, and takes you via \"Via Flaminia\" to the \"Flaminio\" metro station within 6 minutes-and from there, by train, you go wherever you go. If you decide not to wait for the train and to walk all the way to the Flaminio metro station, you'll need about 20-25 minutes. It has to be noted that at this station is located also the quite famous \"Piazza del Popolo\". In addition, the hotel is close to the \"Maxxi\" museum (sth like London's \"Tate modern\") and 15 minutes on foot from the Olympico stadium. How to get there from Fiumicino airport: It's really easy in fact. First of all, you need to reach the Termini station (city centre) and that's not hard no matter which your terminal is. You may go there by train (Fiumicino-Termini with 15 euros) which takes way every half an hour. Some airlines also support shuttle buses to Termini(8 euros).A local taxi to Termini will cost you 35-40 euros. When you reach Termini, you'll have to walk a little if you go there by train, and then you follow the red metro line to Batistini. 4 stations away is \"Flaminio\", and from there you catch the tram, just outside the metro station, and then you will need to get advised from a map to find the excact location of the hotel. It is very easy, though. P.S: Do not look after \"Via Bernando Calentano\". There's nothing like this-or at least I didn't find it. You will easily see the hotel's label on the right side of the \"Via Vignola\" (with direction from the tram and to the Olympico stadium). Believe me, it's very easy to find the hotel even without map.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cAbsolutely Fantastic...just not Catarinah!!\u201d", "Author": "london129", "ReviewID": "UR82788990", "Content": "My family stayed at this wonderful hotel for 5 nights recently.

To get to it, get the metro line A to Flaminia. Once you exit the station, follow the road for 100yrds until you see a tram stop. It has two lines, but only one ever seems to be used. If you get on the tram, I think it is around 4 stops in or can be described as the stop after the tram has changed roads (right turning) and gone past 1 petrol station (right hand side) and the stop is just by an esso petrol station (left) The hotel is on the street opposite and is a two minute walk from the tram drop off. The hotel is lovely and clean. After reading some reviews about how small the rooms were, I did get a little nervous, but we didn't find them to be too small. they weren't the largest, but we had a travel cot and pushchair up in there most of the time and we weren't falling over anything. (oh and travel cot hire charged at E10 / night) Room temperature was perfect for us, but not as cold as many people seem to think it should be, but it was perfect for us and we slept really well. Beds are very comfy and rooms quiet Staff are polite and helpful, you only need to ask! There are some maps of Rome in the reception area, which are really useful for seeing the sites. We didn't use the wi-fi which was E6 for 24hours in your room and E6 for 1 hour in reception. Breakfast was standard continental fare, with plenty on it including scrambled eggs, ham, cheese, salami, bread, pastrys, cake, cereal, yogurt. Coffee isn't great, but as mentioned before, just ask for a cappucino as everyone else and that is much better. No tea/coffee making facilities in the room, which is a shame. Rooms kept clean, but had to ask for toilet paper to be replenished as that wasn't done in the mornings (I did have a stinky cold) I would most certainly recommend this hotel due to ease to get to and from it, it's reasonable rates and comfortable rooms. I would recommend paying E16 to get a week long transport ticket for Rome (metro, tram and bus) as it was really useful getting to places further afield. Book Vatican tickets in advance, as the queue was around 3 hours long by 11am (we did book in advance) Just be warned there are lots of steps in Rome and on the metro, something we didn't take into consideration when bringing a pushchair and toddler!

Now, no driver in Rome would not know about this match and its consequences on traffic so I was a bit upset.

Room - double bed ( well two pushed together securely ) took up most of the space in the room. ( see pics) Pretty clean. Shower only - not an issue for us. No tea or coffee making facilities - a big let down. I consider this pretty standard for good hotels. Satellite TV - only Italian channels on the Sky box - BBC World news in english on the ? Freeview but really terrible picture. Told the Sky isnt working properly - but I dont see how some stations would work and others not. I suspect paying the bit extra for english channels isnt worth it for them. Clientele - a 50/50 mix of tourists and cheap business travellers.

Got a taxi to and from the hotel to the station as it was a hot day - it was well worth it. The room was away from the other rooms, half underground and past the lift at the back of the hotel. Initially seemed very dark with view of concrete, but then again it was also very quiet, cool, and comfortable. Got a room with a shower, not a bath, but still it was a good size and again very clean with plenty hot water. Breakfast was also quite good and kept well stocked. Coffee really does taste odd as mentioned by other reviewers (the Italians left the coffee and requested espressos). Wireless was available at \u20ac6 for 24 hours. Reception were friendly and helpful. Although on the first night they recommended a nearby Restaurant - Ristorante Flaminia or similar. it was the most expensive and worst meal we had in Rome. It was also almost empty - yet the Vignola over the road was very busy and probably a better bet if you want to eat locally. Location is a little out of the centre, but only a short tram ride followed by a few minutes walk, so close enough to get back to after a days sightseeing before heading out again for a meal. The tram is just round the corner (This line also goes to the Vatican) and if the line hadn't been in the middle of some upgrades it would have taken us further into the centre.

Keeping in mind that I had never left the North American Continent and that work decided NOT to spend top dollar on me I was unsure what to expect in Villa Glori. The website is a little misleading with lots of pictures of what seem to be large rooms. WRONG- they are mostly pictures of the common areas and the dining room- which are much smaller in real life. Now, this is not unusual for in Europe space is elusive and even if you have Donald Trump money you will still most likely have to suck in your gut when entering a room! Villa Glori is outside of the downtown, Vatican, tourist area. It is nicely settle in the middle of a Roman neighborhood. That means that it is high density all around The Hotel has something in the neighbor hood of two parking spaces so unless you want to fight the locals for a spot (and they have the edge in this battle) I would take a cab. The desk will gladly call a cab service for you and they are very friendly. The English is so-so, but since Rome is an international city it is possible to get aropund with any of the top 4 languages- even at Villa Glori. There is an elevator, though tiny (maybe two skinny adults fit) it is also extremely quiet. If you get a room by the elevator do not be concerned because you will not hear it. The hotel has less than 50 rooms and the desk will require that you leave the room key with them as you leave for the day. thats just fine because very room key has a large metal plate on it. The plate is used as an electrical key in your room. You slide it in a slot to get the power to turn on. Trust me- you will not want to put the key in your pocket. The rooms are typical European with twin beds unless you specifically book something else. The Tv's are flat panel HD but only CNN international is in English. That's should be fine because when in Rome...you shouldn't be watching too much TV! The decor is modern and the bathrooms are newly renovated complete with towel warmers! Seriously, the bathrooms are spacious, and the showers are comfy for all but the widest Americans. Breakfast is traditional Italian continental. Sliced meats, hard boiled eggs, and plenty of breads. The hotel does only breakfast as they do not have a full blown kitchen. Cereal, milk, sparkling water and fresh juice is also part of the free meal. Since the hotel is in the middle of a nice residential area there are a few restaurants within walking distance. During the day there is plenty of activity, but come evening it slows down to a trickle. Keep in mind that Italians eat pretty late so evening is longer than you might expect, but at night the streets are quiet. I would not walk around too late as the area, like most places in the world, has some scary dark alleys. If you decide to venture into the historical side of Rome (and why not) then the desk will call you a respectable cab and you are about ten kilometers away from Vatican City. I can not wait to visit Rome again. When I do I think Villa GLori will be one of the places I consider staying in. They were less expensive than the hotels outside of Vatican City. Two hundred dollars per night when I compared the rates to some of my business competition. The hotel is part is part of a small regional chain of hotels and they have quality standards and even nice smelling soap.

We reviewed many hotels in the budget to medium price bracket on Trip Advisor before making our selection, lots were around the Termini (Main railway station) area and many of the reviews talk of tired fittings, stained carpets and surley staff. Although the Termini is more central it is a busy, crowded and noisy area. The Quiet suberb where to Villa Glori is situated seemed to us to be the perfect place to unwind and recover after each days busy siteseeing schedual. We also found the local restaurants to be great. Friendly and unpretentious, packed out with local Roman patrons. Trentino's a couple of stops further out on the tram in the Piazza Mancini was a particular hit. Having typed the name of the restaurant I am not sure thats the right name.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Villa Glori. The ladies will love the abundance of mirrors in these rooms and the lighting in the bathroom was fabulous! The view from our room was gorgeous - overlooking an ivy-strewn courtyard and beyond onto some gorgeous Roman residences complete with shutters and roof terraces. It is very private. Our room was small with barely enough room to walk around the beds (2 singles) but had a decent sized and very clean bathroom (exhaust fan not working), safe for your valuables and decent amount of hanging space. The service was polite though we wern't floored with kindness. Our TV wasn't working and it was promptly fixed (a plasma with a pay to view option) and there were no utensils or glasses for eats or drinks you might want to consume in the room (only plastic cups). Air con was great. The one thing I must emphasise is the quietness of this area - it is central but so so quiet. It's just north of Piaza Del Popolo / Flaminio metro - about a 20 min walk to both of these attractions or 10mins on the number 2 tram which is just outside the hotel. A cab from the hotel to the Pantheon or Piaza Navona should only cost 8 euro and from the Termini about 9 euro. It is very reasonable. Don't try any restaurants around the hotel they are all rather average - head to the Jewish quarter or Travestere instead. The breakfast was okay - a plain spread of boiled eggs, rolls, ham/cheese, yoghurts and croissants with coffee and red orange juice. Two things may have helped the ambience of the breakfast room which was lacking in 'vibe' somewhat - some music and the blinds being drawn. I didn't understand them not using their gorgeous courtyard areas during summer - some seating/tables out there to eat breakfast at would be a great way to start the day. This hotel could easily fill a very boutique sector and up its rating and prices to suit if they made some changes like adding a bar/cafe to rest at at the end of an exhaustuing day exploring Roma, and using their space better, because overall it has great bones and is very clean and quiet. We arranged the Terravision shuttle to and from Ciampino airport which was fine but the transit time is quite lengthy (we had to leave at 7.45am from the Termini to catch a 10.45am flight).

If I could, I would rate this a 3 1/2 star due to an issue at check-in, but otherwise we were satisfied. OVERBOOKING ISSUE: When we arrived on Friday midday, reservation in hand, we were told that they overbooked and would move us. I research properties before I go, and on top of this we were exhausted, so moving to another property I did not know was unacceptable. I told the desk this and, after a time, checked us in. While I was talking to the desk person, another family came down and told me that the same thing happened to them the evening before, and that he learned that around 10 parties were similarly \"overbooked.\" In this age of computerized reservations and to-the-minute updates, I have no doubt that the overbooking was intentional, not a system issue. EVERYTHING ELSE: Other than this issue, the hotel was very good. The room was small (9x11) but typical by European standards, but impeccably clean and very comfortable. The bathroom was also impeccable, with a powerful though very small shower. Beds were generally comfortable though just a smallish double; I'd prefer a feather top or other more comfortable bed. Closet space was also a bit tight, but acceptable. The hotel is in a small alley/street in a lovely residential neighborhood, very pleasant to sit outside or walk around and quiet. Breakfasts were average European fare, good but with modest selection. Service after we checked in was good. Our room was cleaned early, and they seemed to get in there even when we were only gone an hour or so. The front desk called taxis for us and provided some other guidance; only the day staff was very fluent in English. Location was reasonably accessible from Centro Storico (downtown monuments) and other areas, but not as close as being there, of course. The tram, which we used frequently, takes about 8 minutes to get to its last stop on Flaminio, and from there the metro is about a 5 minute walk. Taxis to Centro Storico varied from 7 to 13 Euro each way, depending on traffic and time of day. There are several local dining options: three trattorias, fairly comparable, on the street opposite and a gelateria around the corner. All had good service and deep menus; we recommend them for moderate-cost, satisfying local fare or a wine break. In summary, we enjoyed this hotel, but the check in overbooking issue left a bad taste.

Getting around on the metro is easy and a taxi to the Trastevere area for dinner was 10-15 Euros 1 way, so it was not an issue for us that you couldn't walk to the major attractions. A great stay for a reasonable price.", "Date": "October 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "UK", "Title": "\u201cVery smart hotel\u201d", "Author": "MelMama", "ReviewID": "UR5788741", "Content": "I was delighted with the Villa Glori, our room was much smarter than the photos show. There were plenty of large mirrors, a large fully tiled shower room, good sized roomsafe and minibar. The hairdryer isn't fantastic though so bring your own if you're very fussy! The only downside to the location of the room on the ground floor was the proximity to the breakfast room directly opposite. We were woken early with the scraping of chairs on the tiled floor either the early guests or staff preparing for breakfast, I'm not sure which. This served as an alarm call! The breakfast had a good selection of croissants/rolls etc plus cereals,yogurts and the usual continental cheeses and meats. The reception staff were very helpful and we thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay. The no 2 tram stop is very close to the hotel and it's only a 20 minute walk to Paizza del Poppolo, which was fine during the day although we used taxis in the evening which cost 5 or 6 euros from near Piazza Navona.", "Date": "September 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "NE England", "Title": "\u201cA great place\u201d", "Author": "LittleOl", "ReviewID": "UR5622473", "Content": "We were in Rome for only a few days and this hotel proved to be ideal. It is only a short and cheap tram ride towards the centre of Rome yet far enough away to be out of the tourist trap. The hotel was spotless and the reception staff were all fluent in English and very helpful. The reception desk is manned 24-7 so there is no trouble getting your key. Breakfast was basic but adequate and don't really have any major complains. The room was spotless and it was great having an LCD TV with sky with channels I could put into English! The room was quite a good size and very comfortable. The only thing that I could complain about was that the air conditioning was not that good and the room was quite warm - not good in Rome in August. Would easily stay there again. There are two restaurants on the same road as the hotel and I wouldn't bother with either of them. The one at the bottom of the street spoke no English and even though my Italian is very limited I am sure that it was her fault that we didn't get what we wanted. We were also charged for drinks that we didn't order. We just paid up and left without leaving a tip. If you do onto the street running parallel to the hotel (nearer the centre of Rome) there is another restaurant about half way up. Again the staff didn't speak English but this made no difference. The staff were helpful and friendly and the food was fantastic. We wanted to go back on our last night but unfortunately it was closed. The best meal we had in two weeks. A good place to stay and if I return to Rome I would probably return there.", "Date": "August 18, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Villa Glori Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d231926-Reviews-Villa_Glori_Hotel-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$98 - $344*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via B Celentano 11</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00196</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "231926", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4e/c0/4ec0d69b643fff955f90bc34259b3e0e4large.jpg"}}
