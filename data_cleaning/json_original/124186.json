We were on the 12/5 sailing of the Enchantment of the Seas and since the Comfort Inn is closed due to renovations we got moved next door to the Sleep Inn. First off the Hotel is very nice and in a nice location. When we checked in all the parking spots in front of the hotel were full so we waited until the next morning and as others came off their sailing we moved our vehicle to a spot in front of the lobby parking and had no problems whatssoever. The hotel was clean, comfortable and easy to get to the major highways. Since there were a large group of people going on the cruise there were always people in the lobby area talking, reading and socializing with each other. The breakfast was a continental breakfast and was constantly being replenished. The Front desk was kept quite busy and for the most part very pleasant. I did feel sorry for the staff in the morning when everyone was trying to sign up for the shuttle and also people trying to check out. As for the shuttle let's talk. The day we were leaving there were so many people downstairs waiting early. For the first hour there was only 1 shuttle running and then another drive came on so we had a total of 2 vans that held 10 people. One thing the hotel did was they would not let you sign up for the shuttle until you were checked out of your room. So since DH wanted to sleep in a little we didn't check out of the room until 9:45 and didn't get on the shuttle until 11:15. For me it wasn't that bad since I like to talk I found plenty of people from our roll call to converse with. Now coming back that's another story. We were told to not call the hotel until we were through Customs and had our luggage. So of course I did the opposite and called when we docked and asked for a number and was told it would be #5 so I thought no problem. Well after talking with the hotel I realized that it was 7:00 and our departure time was 8:20 - 8:40 and still had to go through customs and pick up luggage so I knew that no way would we make that so I told her to cancel our number and we'd call back later. I'm so glad we did. When we got off at 8:25 and went through everything it was approx. 8:55 and I called the hotel back and were were now #25. So we went out to wait and found friends of ours that had gotten off with the carry off luggage and had been waiting 1 1/2 hrs already and still had 5 more numbers to go until they could get on the shuttle. So I said forget it I'm not waiting and we got a taxi which cost us $30 w/o tip and we were back at the hotel by 9:30. I did go in and let the Hotel know to cancel our number and they were very appreciative since they had so many people still to load. Sorry this is so long but I wanted to give you all the details and unless you don't want to wait after the cruise take the taxi especially since it's cold outside and it's an open area. Hope this helps.

But my last visit will be my last stay at this hotel, and also will make sure my friends and family avoid it also. I am VERY upset right now! The story is\u2026...After returning from my trip @ 10:00 PM we called the hotel for the shuttle to pick us up, we were told to rush up the drop off area of the airport, or we would need to wait appx 40 minutes for the next shuttle to arrive. No problem, we get upstairs with a few minutes to spare. Shuttle arrives and we move our luggage (even though driver states, he will move it) and STROLLER (grandmother remembers)....specifically, putting stroller right with the luggage in the rear of the shuttle. Driver has numerous people to load, so he tells us to start boarding the shuttle, because he also has to pick up a flight crew at another spot in terminal, we all board the shuttle. And assume that all of our luggage and STROLLER are placed on the shuttle van. This is occurring at about 10:30 PM. So we get back to the hotel and he drops off some travelers at the door and proceeds to take us to our car (driver was very nice gentleman) he unloads are luggage and places it in the vehicle, as I am putting the baby car seat back into the vehicle, and loading my grandson. We all get home safely. Several days later, I called my daughter, because she traveled with us, and I again assume that she has the STROLLER, only to discover, she thinks I have the STROLLER. After discussing the scenario with each other, and our other traveling companion, we realize that the stroller never came off of the hotel shuttle van. So, now I contact the hotel and speak with a young lady at the front desk (did this for 2 1/2 days) while she contacted housekeeping and whoever else. Finally on the 3rd day, I was able to speak with a manager \u201cGlen\u201d, who took the information and stated he would check around and get back to me within 24 hours. 24 hours came and went with no word from Manager \u201cGlen\u201d so I proceeded to call him. Manager, pretty much told me, I am out of luck and there is nothing they can do for me, I should have made sure luggage and STROLLER were placed in van, instead of following the drivers orders, when driver stated to proceed getting on the van, so he could load up and move on. I should have ignored the driver, and made sure everything was placed inside of the van, prior to getting myself on the van. Manager was not very helpful nor apologetic about my situation. I recently purchased this Chicco STROLLER for my grandson, because it was more comfortable then your average umbrella stroller. I am now in the process of working with the airport in hopes that the stroller may have been turned in by a kind soul. IF the stroller was left sitting at the curb and did not make it on the van. I have no way of knowing if it did or not, due to Sleep in Suites, not being very helpful with the situation. Personally, I don\u2019t think they did any research and did not care one way or the other about the missing STROLLER. And the manager\u2026\u2026.in my experience of working with the public, has no people skills at all.

Their answer was 'we were not able to locate your shirt'. Keep in mind that it was in the closet on a hanger... now why they felt they needed to keep my top is beyond me.

Once I checked into my room I found that the light bulb in the bathroom blew, the smoke detector was hanging out of the ceiling, and you could hear everything on both sides of you. I tried to order a movie to drown out my neighbors and the movies didn't work! I had to have it credited to my account because the screen kept jumping. Breakfast is a selection of bagels and cereals, no eggs, bacon or anything like that just in case that is what you think when you see the banners everywhere - they aren't for the hotel, they are for a restaurant next door, which you must pay for. In addition, the woman who keeps the breakfast area going was completely miserable, and stood in everyone's way as they were trying to get food, and then had the nerve to throw an attitude about people bumping into her. It was quite obvious to everyone that she hates her job! As if this isn't all bad enough, the front desk people were rude beyond belief. Everytime I called to ask them a question they acted as if I was inconveniencing them. The printer in the computer area was out of toner and I was told that \"yep, they are waiting for it, don't know when it will be here\" and that was that. One might think they would offer to let me use their copier or printer but that did not happen. I am military and was put up at this hotel while I awaited a flight to the Middle East for a deployment. My flight didn't leave until 9 at night. I asked if I could have a late, 4pm check out. I was told that I would have to pay for another night unless I checked out by 2. When I asked to speak to the manager I was told that the manager works 7-7 but at 11am had still not come in, that they show up when they feel like it. On top of that, she was very quick to tell me that the manager would tell me the same thing so there was no point in waiting to talk to anyone else. Apparently, despite their many yellow ribbons in support of the military, they could really care less about making my last experience before I leave a good one. They have tons of awards around for great customer service. All I can figure is that they have a friend on the awards board.

Secondly, we had an adjoining room and th guests in the other room had children who were up before 8 a.m. and were really loud.

Now, I've never stayed in a hotel where I had to turn the refrigerator on, nor did anyone tell me that I had to. She then told me that she's stayed at many hotels and that she has had to turn the refrigerator on. I told her that's not important, but the fact is, I'd spent money on food that I couldn't eat. She put me on hold for five minutes. I called back and she told me she had an emergency at the front desk and that's why I was on hold so long. As we continued to talk. she then told me that while I was on hold she had gone to find the housekeeper who was on duty Sunday.

They have a free 24-hour shuttle service to and from BWI that picks you up when you call them, and leaves the hotel on the hour and half hour. The Sleep Inn and the Comfort Inn are adjacent and share the same shuttle. I almost missed my shuttle pickup at BWI because the van was marked \"Comfort Inn\" on the front, and only had a small Sleep Inn icon on the side. Other than that, the shuttle service was fast and courteous. Sleep Inn is a couple of miles away from the airport, about a 7-10 minute drive. The employees at check-in were nice, and the lobby and public areas were clean and appeared newly renovated. There was a little business center with a couple of computers for guests to use. I think this hotel caters mostly to airline flight crew. The continental breakfast (a couple muffins, bagels, some cereal) started at 3:00 AM to accomodate people on early flights. My room was clean but spartan. The bathroom was spotless, and came with some shampoo, lotion, a couple bars of soap, and some thin towels. The bed and linens were clean and comfortable. The HVAC system was loud, and the room was somewhat musty when I first arrived. I appreciated the free wireless internet, although I had some problems with connectivity, probably due to my room location at the very end of the building. There was a mini-fridge and a coffee maker in the room. I was looking for dinner at 11:00 PM, so the desk clerk recommended Rose's and gave me a coupon for 10% off. Rose's is in the same complex as the Comfort Inn/Sleep Inn. They have late-night food and a lounge (I think the kitchen closed around midnight or 12:30?), but a very limited menu after 10:30. Other than Rose's, only a Checkers burger stand and a gas station were within walking distance. I felt a little uncomfortable walking around the area at that hour. I would be unlikely to stay here again unless the rate was very cheap, or I had an extremely early flight.
