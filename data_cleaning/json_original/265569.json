The hotel itself was a decent value for the money, however the hotel staff were next to useless. They operate on a system where you leave your room key at the front door. Maybe I'm a bit paranoid, but they don't do any type of check to make sure it's actually your room key you're taking when you come back. I felt like anyone could come in say my room number and get into our room.

So I arrived at the hotel with my expectations very low. I think some of the reviews haven't really factored in that it has a 2-star rating... So my overall rating was based on this. I have stayed in 4 & 5 star hotels in the past, and you just have to adjust your expectations accordingly. If some reviewers received a poor service though, this is fair enough. I was down on business for 3 nights, so really I was just needing a bed & place to wash. My double room was on the first floor at the back of the hotel. So although the window was single-glazed, I wasn't disturbed by noise at night (and I'm a light sleeper!). Saying that I was only staying mid-week. The room, although not large was fine. The decor was fairly modern, and it had a tv, tea/coffee making facilities, shampoo, soap, hairdryer, hot water(!) etc. Not bad I thought for 2 stars! I didn't actually use the breakfast room at all, as I just ate at the office. Nor did I pay for the wifi. So I can't comment/rate on this. You're probably wondering why I didn't give it five stars. There were a couple of small reasons for this. The TV signal kept going fuzzy every 10 mins or so then back to normal. But then I wasn't really there to watch TV, so didn't complain. Also after making myself a cup of tea in the room on the first morning, I realised there was no spoon/stirrer to stir my tea. So I improvised & then mentioned it to reception as I left that morning, and to please give me a spoon tomorrow. But they didn't seem to remember. I didn't bother making a big deal of it for the rest of my stay. Just a bit annoying. Overall though my stay was fine & uneventful.

Drafty door in the corner disguised as a window with bed pushed up against it, the head board leaning free against the door. 5. Hotel on main road, our room was on that side. Traffic picked up around 5am and was quite niosy. 6.Breakfast room smells strange, no windows and staff were not talkative, food was basic cornflakes, toast, plastic ham and cheese, no fry ups or pastries.

My friend and I checked in, and our room was at the very back of the hotel.

Yes, it was a large room (we booked a twin), and yes it was clean. The wardrobe could have been put against the disguised door in the corner, eliminating the draft. Breakfast was basic with just cornflakes or bran flakes, orange or apple juice, toast and the continental option comprised of plastic ham and cheese. No fry ups or pastries here!

That said, it was a Fawlty-Towers-type experience (without the humour) which I do not wish to repeat. I had emphasised in the booking that it was conditional on there being a functioning lift as stairs would be a problem to us, and asked that if there was no functioning lift the management contact us. No contact received other than a confirmation of the booking - and when we arrived we found we were in a basement room (down stairs). On enquiring about the lift we were told, offhandedly, that it was 'out of order'. No apology. When I said that this posed a problem I was told 'Oh, it's only one or two stairs - maybe three'. Actually, it was more than 20! The (male) receptionist did not offer to carry our heavy luggage down said stairs and initially stared at me when I requested help with it. Fortunately I can be assertive when required and eventually he did help. On arrival in our room we found that the advertised tea-making facilities consisted of cups and saucers but no kettle! The man on reception was unapologetic about this omission but agreed to 'see whether he could find us one', and brought it to our room half an hour later. By that time we had discovered the unbelievably uncomfortable mattresses, which appeared to have no padding between the springs and the fabric cover. Fortunately it was a hot night so we could lie on top of the duvets, which insulated us slightly from the springs. On trying to turn the light off we discovered the next problem, which was that it continued to flash on and off for the next half hour - but by this time we had realised that if we asked for anything to be done about it we would be likely to be up for a lot longer, waiting for something to be done, so we closed our eyes and tried to ignore it. In the morning, after an extremely uncomfortable night, we were foolish enough to go to breakfast: cornflakes, milk, white toast (they said they didn't have any brown, despite my having asked for that on the booking too), jam, and tea or coffee, served in a dingy, windowless basement room. When the 'waitress' said they had no brown bread to toast I asked whether anyone had read my booking request, and she unapologetically said 'no'. To be fair, the reception man did (on being asked) help us back up the stairs with our luggage. None of the staff seemed to have the slightest notion of customer care, hospitality, looking after people or even basic courtesy, and I was truly embarrassed that the many overseas visitors there would have this as part of their experience of Britain. If you had a category for 'attitude' I would rate that as 'terrible' too.
