{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Nice Little Hotel with a Difference (from the hotel chains). I stayed in a standard room on level 4 @ the hotel for three nights recently as a single guest. The room was average in size but was very clean and tidy. It offered all the normal comfort and supplies you would fine in any international hotel chains. What sets it apart from the hotel chain properties is the service. Service was there before I could finish requesting it! Well, just about. The location is excellent. The price is very competitive. I must add that I am a Chinese speaking guest and I can not comment on the staff members' English proficiency. They were always ready to help neverhteless.", "Date": "Oct 18, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR801286832", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Melburnian-3125"}, {"Content": "Good choice in central Beijing The Cui Ming Zhuang is a pretty good choice for hotels in Beijing. As other reviewers have said, it is in a convenient location, and the rooms are pretty nice and very clean. The staff is efficient and polite, and my requests for towels and room amenities met with rapid, polite response. My room was rather strange, in that the window overlooked the dining room, and did not give on the outside, so there was no way to get fresh air; however, the air in the summer in Beijing is not particularly fresh, anyway, so I did not perceive this as a problem.Hotels in China seem to have their air conditioning programmed so that the cooling (but not the fan) turns off sometime in the night, no matter where you have the thermostat set., Cui Ming Zhuang was no exception -- we would come back in the afternoon to a very chilly 20 deg (68 deg F) room, not change the thermostat, and by morning it would be a somewhat stuffy 25 deg (77 deg F).", "Date": "Jul 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR671774844", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "MartineB"}, {"Content": "Decent Hotel We stayed at this hotel on two separate occassions during a three week trip to China. For location, you cannot do better. You can actually see one of the gates (not an entrance though) to the Forbidden City from the sidewalk in front of the hotel. Tiannamen and Beihai Park are 10-15 minutes walks. One block away in the opposite direction contains great shopping and some Western restaurant options. The rooms were clean and in very good condition. HINT: ask for a room on the second floor or higher. The room on the first floor was noticeably smaller than the room on the third floor during our second stay. The first floor bathroom was also smaller and apparently traditional for Chinese guests, with no tub, a hand held shower head and a wooden grate over a drain. The third floor bathroom contained a traditional bathroom. One drawback was the limited English skills of the staff, although they were very earnest and tried very hard to provide assistance. The best English speakers were the overall hotel manager and oddly, the dayshift bellhop. Our expectations were also tempered by the understanding that we were traveling in China and English speakers are a luxury. A second drawback was the A/C units in both rooms. Neither made the rooms very cool. Both thermostats were set at the lowest setting of 15 Degrees Celsius, although the room temperature never approached this level. Also, the cleaning staff would always readjust the thermostat to 25 degrees while we were out during the day. The breakfast buffet at 68 yuan (about $9) was very decent. Except for the AC issues, overall a very good hotel.", "Date": "May 21, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR584295635", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "BamaTraveler07"}, {"Content": "very good hotel at a very good price I just returned from Beijing and stayed for a week at the Cui Ming Zhuang. Be aware that the hotel is also known as the Jade Garden Hotel. That\u9e93s what the sign in front of the hotel says.The location is excellent... 2 blocks from Wangfujing Street, 2 blocks from the Forbidden City.The hotel was very good. It was remodeled last year so everything is new and clean. The breakfast buffet has western and chinese food for 68 yuan per person. You can get a cheaper breakfast at a cafe about a block away if you are going towards the Forbidden City... I think it\u9e93s called Gate Cafe or Egate Cafe.The only downside to our stay was the limited English of the staff. The man at the travel counter and in the gift store spoke no English at all.
