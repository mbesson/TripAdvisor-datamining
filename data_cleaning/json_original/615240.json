{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Tuscan Perfection! During our 2-month tour of Europe Podere Marciano was surely one of the highlights. Tucked away off of a long dirt road\u9225\u6515o remote you begin to wonder\u9225\u6501nd clinging to the high point of a hill, appears this lovely, authentically reproduced Tuscan farmhouse with extraordinary views of distant hill towns. The owner, Federica, employed a skilled decorator who has finished each of the rooms and public areas with top-notch furnishings conveying an elegant Tuscan feel. The property is surrounded by lush woodlands, working farms and vineyards. After you arrive and settle in, you\u9225\u6a92l wonder how you can ever tear yourself away.During our week there in July, blooming lilac bushes and an assortment of potted and planted flowers attracted butterflies (and wasps). The huge, stone-lined, infinity pool is gorgeous\u9225\u6506lanked by a typical row of cypresses and a waterfall. On hot days Federica brings down cool drinks to be purchased on the honor system. At breakfast you are provided with vast array of bread, cheese and meat options, along with a variety of fruits and cereals, all beautifully presented.Our spacious room was a suite with a gorgeous canopy bed, an unparalleled view, a large sitting area, stepping down into a hallway with closets (and a safe), a separate toilet room, and a claw-foot tub. Every imaginable amenity is provided, and here we had one of two true king-sized bed during our travels. Our room, as well as the public areas, was softly washed in warm, coordinated colors. We had a lovely terrace with a panoramic view, but unfortunately the hungry wasps (and my phobia) kept us from enjoying it fully. Our room, and several of the others I saw, was elegant and romantic. Twice during our stay the family offered catered dinners (for an extra charge) which were thoroughly enjoyed by the guests. The hosts, Federica and her husband, are extremely gracious and friendly.Podere Marciano is such a serene, beautiful property that I\u9225\u6a93 afraid it will be \u9225\u6e04iscovered\u9225?and will sell out when I want to return! If you are interested in the Chianti region, particularly the Castellina area, I cannot imagine that Podere Marciano can be beat. From here you can easily visit every corner of the region, including Pisa, Florence, Cortona or San Gimignano.", "Date": "Sep 19, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR704613085", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Litlove39"}, {"Content": "Podere Marciano....heaven on earth!       podere marciano", "Date": "Jun 28, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR494646010", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "KathyAnn"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d615240-r5816867-Antico_Podere_Marciano-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "615240", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
