The rooms need refurbishing since the hotel is a bit old. The hotel is always buzzing with activity, the staff is very helpful, choice of F&B is excellent and the faciltities are very good.

It's pretty far north of IST airport and really not walking distance to the heart of istanbul. You can't walk anywhere and there's no subway station nearby. Yes, it's right next to the Bosphorus, but you cant' really walk to it nor can you really see it from your hotel room. For the tower that i was assigned, just the first room in the end can see the bosphorus. that's if you're lucky you received that room. unfortunately, i had the other end. i only stayed here for the bosphorus and feel i got jipped. it's just too far from the action. without traffic, it'll be about 10 lira to taxsim square by cab. from/to the airport, it'll cost about 70 lira by cab. you'll use the cab a lot if you need to travel out of this hotel, which is why i'm giving you these reference points. hotel: security is super tight. when you get thru with a taxi, there's a person checking underneathe the car and the trunk. and, when you walk in, there's a metal detector you walk through. does it ruin anything? not really. but i don't feel safe or unsafe. just neutral. the grand, open lobby is the place with the amazing view of the bosphorus. that's about it. had a glass of wine and cup of coffee that totaled US$30. yeah.... rip, but that's hotel prices for ya.... the best thing about this place was the concierge. they were super willing to help make restaurant reservations for you or help you find a location in a map. room: clean and modern within the bedroom. bathroom is spacious, but the showertub can do some work. there was no shower door -- just some rinky dinky window shielding some splash. staff did a good job cleaning up the place and making it homely with a turkish delight treat for you in the evening. there's complimentary water and wifi, so those are big pluses to me. most luxury hotels don't offer them for free. breakfast: not included.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sausalito, California", "Title": "\u201cClassic Istanbul Hotel\u201d", "Author": "MissBabblicious", "ReviewID": "UR127778063", "Content": "We arrived here straight from the airport and got amazing service from the moment we arrived. When we checked in, the front desk manager, Utku Dizdar, said he was upgrading me because I'm a travel agent. Not expected, but certainly welcome! When he saw it was my birthday, he upgraded us to the Bosphorus corner room. Before we could even finish unpacking, there was a knock at the door. Mr Dizdar had sent up a small cake and a bottle of wine also for my birthday! I was speechless- he had gone above and beyond to make this a VERY memorable birthday. This room was an absolute dream. Words cannot even describe the view. We left the curtains open so that we could wake up to the sunrise every morning. What a fabulous way to start a morning! Their champagne breakfast buffet is maybe a little pricey compared to everything else in Istanbul but definitely worth it. Omelet station, crepe station, breads, pastries, cheeses, homemade jams and compotes, nuts, cereals, and everything else you could want. Not to mention the superb staff there. We spent at least an hour there each morning. As for other reviews about this hotel being in the middle of nowhere, those people clearly didn't bother to walk around and explore. You are less than a 10 minute walk from Nisantasi which is a very chic and upscale part of Istanbul. It is a shoppers dream with everything from Gap and Banana Republic to Gucci, Prada and Alexander McQueen. If you walked down the hill, it was a 10 min walk to Dolmabahce Palace. 5 minutes further was the main hub of buses, metros, and ferries. The metro took you straight to Sultanhamet and was only 2 pesos. Taksim was probably a 15 minute walk away. If you stay here, there is NO reason to have to take a cab because everything is a short and beautiful walk away. They have a great spa with a pool, sauna, steam room, and whirlpool. They also have a fitness center with daily classes as local residents also use it as their gym. This is actually really nice as you meet locals and find out the cool, non-touristy places to go.

The Swissotel is a different price category but you would still expect some cutting edge accomodation from a \"Leading hotel of the world\". The entrance, hotel lobby and bar + restaurants on the lower floors are definitely glam bam eighties but not fit for 2012. It is a very big and very busy hotel. Expect conventions and groups to occupy large parts of the foyer and the lobby at all times. Reception was very polite and swift, off we went to the executive club lounge which is comfortable, well stocked and where you will find an extremely courteous welcome. Service through the 4 days of our stay was immaculate. The room, upgraded compliments of leaders club, was the letdown. Spectacular view, no terrace and if you tried to open the window slits to get some fresh air a spectacular draft set in. The room was totally overheated (in wintertime Istanbul gets pretty cold) and it took us 2 days to cool it off to a somehwat comfortable range. Furnishings again very 80s and outdated, but in reasonable shape. Espresso machine with one capsule of espresso and one capsule of decaf (period). Control of lighting was cumbersome and not adapted (only one side of the bed could control the lights, including what was supposed to be a reading light. Functional bathroom (luxury Sheraton 70s style), but do not attempt to draft a warm bath as the tub takes over an hour to fill (no pressure). The shower changes from cold to scolding hot water within the blink of an eye. Bath products were ample and adequate.Quality of bedding was ok, although upon arrival our bedsheet was ripped and damaged.Cleanliness and housekeeping as expected (very high standard). Breakfast at the buffet restaurant is a very pedestrian and typical large hotel affair which is a functional way of getting as many people in as little time as possible through the procedure. The executive lounge is a welcome respite from this madness and was very appreciated. One evening out at Gaja restaurant showed what Swissotel is capable of. We have been a dozen times to Istanbul and could witness the quantum leaps this city took lately in the restaurant and hospitality business. At Gaja restaurant Swissotel offers a world class culinary experience for the seasoned gourmet. We like to be surprised by a good restaurant and surprised we were. Cudos to chef William Mahi who will surely turn this hotel restaurant in the Istanbul frontrunner on the local restaurant scene within a few months from now.

As Sunflowers by the Sea rightly says, The Swissotel The Bosphorous is five stars and part of the Leading Hotel of the World collection, but the criteria for these is questionable. The rooms are dated. I was upgraded to a room with a better view - of the parking lot. The rack rate posted in my room was 800 euro. The room was no better than a standard room at an older Marriott. Some of the furniture could use a spruce and the light switches are positively puzzling. There is no extra plug next to the bed to charge your phone, so I had to unplug the night light each night. I liked the Purovel bath products, but because of the half screen on the side of the bath tub and the big gap between the wall and the screen, after having showered there would be a large pool of water next to the tub. Very annoying. Everything here is overpriced. Bar drinks average 17 euro for a cocktail. They charge 19.95 euro a day for WiFi. Outrageous. In this day and age, where internet access is expected. Boutique hotels like Hotel Amira offer WiFi for free; any large hotel should be ashamed to charge for WiFi, let alone that much. As we were here for a conference - and it snowed non-stop, we didn't have a chance to leave the hotel much. The buffet food was the same every single day, lunch and dinner. The same steamed vegetables, the same chicken and salmon dishes, the same rice pilaf, and the same desserts. Judging from the quality of the food by day 4, some of the food wasn't just the same recipe, but literally the exact same food.

This included desserts! Unacceptable for a five star hotel. I stayed in an average room in the West Tower on the 12th floor. The rooms had an 'antique feel' - I'm sure the carpets and fixtures were expensive at some point, but now they seem outdated in need of repair.

A beautiful hotel on the Bospherous with all the trappings of a 5 star hotel . Clean rooms with great views - if you can stay on the East Wing . Great breakfast , superb concierge service esp Murat -very helpful in booking resteraunts , very knowledgeable about the city and its wonders . Istanbul is a place where the east meets west and its this mix thats greets you be it the spice bazaar, or grand bazaar or the numerous shops , street vendors, monuments . The sightseeing , numeorus shops , bazaars however are in Sultanamet which is a 15 min taxi drive in the morning and a 45 min drive if you and you will get caught in evening traffic at some time . So if you want to be where the action is and save your self the agony of getting caught in traffic every time you venture out stay in Sultanament , its got tons of hotels ,cafes, easy to reach monuments, and is more lively place i feel. The Bospherous is however the calm in the whole storm of activity and if you like to come back after an action packed day to some peace and calm then the bosperous side is for you. Sitting by the waterfront or watching the last ferrys depart from their piers from your hotel with the lights all lit on both sides is just very peaceful and a nice way to end your day, esp in December when its cold . Having said that all the five star hotels or most of them are in this area and so if 5 star hotels and their dinning is your thing then this is the place to stay . The Dolmache palace is also the only main monument close . Some of the premier night clubs are also to be found on this side but its mainly quite after dark unless you head up to walking street where the action is which is about 10 min walk from the hotel. So just as Istanbul is all about the east and west so is Sutanament and the Bosperous . Both areas have their charms Familys and Business minded people ,,or those who just want some peace after a full day may prefer this side over the other Buts thats just Istanbul......", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oslo", "Title": "\u201cMeeting high expectations\u201d", "Author": "SDtraveller55", "ReviewID": "UR122476264", "Content": "A modern hotel in a great location.

Things I liked about the hotel include great view (my room had a sea view), grand view from the lobby, excellent facilities including great spa gym in door pool, and my experience with the concierge was excellent (they were the best staff in the hotel). A sea view room could make this hotel enjoyed best by honeymooners. Now as for the bad, the front desk staff were not as helpful, I was checked in to double room bed which are small instead of one king size bed, room rate is somewhat high, I caught error in extra billing (this was corrected fast but these things shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen), my reservation was supposed to have internet connection and 1 complementary dry clean for some reason on check in this was not included in my room, my breakfast was included in the room rate but first morning I was stopped by staff checking names for breakfast because she couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find my name, she called someone and after 5 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 10 minutes she let me in. Finally, location is not within walking distance from Taksim square, you will need a 5 minute ride by taxi to get to this area, which in my opinion you will enjoy any other hotel much more if it was within walking distance from Taksim squire. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t get me wrong, with all these issues, the hotel is still good, the room is very nice and spacious, and view is maybe one of the best in Istanbul. Yet, my opinion is if you are in a city (not in a beach resort) then you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need fancy hotel as much as you need to be close to where the exiting events are.

You step out of e taxi and they have already checked your luggage for your name and greet you by name, ensure you can find reception. As someone else said, nice foyer - very grand. And then I got to check-in. Thought I had a room with access to the executive lounge, but apparently not. Reservation was quite confusing to me, but then apparently it was also confusing to the receptionist. She told me I did not have breakfast included in the rate and I did not have Internet access. I assured her I did and once I went to show her the reservation she suddenly noticed these were included plus a newspaper, dry cleaning and an evening cocktail...and I could have the evening coktail in the executive lounge! Get to my room and am very happy as the window opened. No view to speak of, well unless the cars arriving excite you. Was supposed to have a view of the park - did not appreciate this meant the car park. Based On the views from the restaurant go for the rooms with a view of the Bosphorus. Bed was comfortable. WiFi was very intermittent and so glad it was included in my rate as otherwise I would have been very annoyed by the spotty reception. Bathroom had a close up mirror and large bench. But for a hotel of this class not to have hair conditioner was an insult. Went and bought a bottle so that I had some. Then I went to the hamam. Awesome massage and sauna and steam room. Had a facial the next time. Fantastic treatments. The spa is excellent as is the indoor pool. There is a mosque close by and could hear the prayer to call before sunrise and the last call each night. Fantastic as I love hearing the call to prayer. Went to the Dolabache Palace. Very close, and the concierge told me of the quick way out of the hotel from the fifth floor past the pool - exemplary service. The food from room service was okay - the Turkish food was a bit disappointing. Breakfast was a nice spread with something for everyone. But strange breakfast experience on the second morning. I was seated and then came back from the buffet (having left my BB, paper and glasses at my place) to find two Turkish girls had planted themselves at my table at a table for two with only a setting for one! They acted like this was very normal. I was astounded and the wait staff just ignored the whole thing and brought them two extra places - it was bot crowded to scythe least! Then check-out. OMG - I was charged for numerous things from the minibar. I never use the minibar as my work does not reimburse. So they removed the items. And then I asked about the charge for the cash out. They told me I took a cash advance the afternoon before. I explained that that was not possible as I was at The Palace at that time and showed them my ticket. So then they said must have used the hairdresser, no not so. Finally they decided it was when I had my shoes shined. Now the hotel directory discussed a free shoe shine each night, but apparently I was wrong. I said in that case I would pay as that was mu misunderstanding and was not fair to the poor shoe shine guy. I know what the book said and I did not use the dry cleaning nor the cocktail each night. By this time it had taken me 20 minutes to checkout and I needed to get to my car (I was 10 minutes late). Room and desk in the room are a good size and a couple of outlet plugs at the desk level which was nice. As I have stayed at a number of different hotels in Istanbul, if I need to be in the Bekistas area again for business, will go back to the Intercontinental. The Swissotel was closer to my business meeting and the Palace hence the reason I chose it. So check-in and check-out were atrocious, but concierge was great. Waitstaff ignored locals planting them selves at my table, but spa was awesome.

I stayed at the Swissotel during my visit. I had reserved a non-smoking room. Upon check-in I was told I would get a lawn facing view. I requested for a Bosphorus view and was given one - a smoking-room - but to my surprise a much bigger one than what I had booked. the view of the Bosphorus was great but the room smelled of smoke. I told the housekeeping and they did some ozone-treatment (or so they called it) while I was out having dinner and upon my return the smoke-smell was gone. So I got a bigger room than what I had booked with a Bosphorus view - what more could I ask for. Since I was out on business almost the entire time - I did not explore too much in the hotel. The buffet b'fast was quite good and elaborate with lots of choices and a nice indoor + outdoor seating arrangement. One major concern was the Internet cost - at EUR 20 per day (unlimited) - or Eur 7 per hour - it seemed a bit expensive. Same with TV. The free TV channels in the room were all crap and ordering a movie from the hotel was quite expensive again. Another concern is the location - from a traffic jam perspective. It took about 1 hour from the airport to reach in the hotel in mid-day (that is off-peak) hours. Also going out anywhere in the evening meant half an hour of traffic jam just 2-3 mins out of the hotel. The staff seemed quite nice and eager to help. Thanks.

I must say that I have stayed in many nice hotels but this one is on the top of my list. I went to Istanbul to meet an old friend but as I arrived my friend had to be away for a business trip. So I ended up staying for only 2 nights at the hotel. I was very pleased overall that I chose Swissotel. The lobby and entrance was gorgeous, I would say the views are some of the best in the city. You look out right into a palace and the Blue Mosque is right across the Bosphorus. I chose (upon reading many reviews) to upgrade to the executive level suite that allows you access to the top floor for drinks and food throughout the day. This includes a great breakfast, lunch and snacks for Happy Hour. It was well worth it and the views from the top floor executive level are amazing! Each morning I had a friendly breakfast and my little friend met me on the perch, he was a bird who liked to nibble on my salmon while I enjoyed my turkish coffee. The room was very cozy and came with all of the comforts of home including a view. It had a great shower and marble bathroom, wireless internet, comfortable and soft sheets and bed, minibar, nice adjustable lighting, and a safe for your valuables. I enjoyed looking out the window and seeing the Bosphorus from the other side looking at the bridge....at night it was breathtaking. If you are looking for ultra modern decor it is not that type of hotel but it is elegant in every way imaginable. I felt safe and I felt secure being in a city alone for the first time. There was a conference at the hotel and I got to meet some nice wives around during the day. The gym and spa was really top notch. I took 2 classes with an instructor and the gym itself was complete with cardio machines and weights and weight machines. The people there were on a membership and a nice class of people. I had to meet my friend finally at 8 PM on my check out day so I enjoyed the pool and gym all day long. I had a nice lunch at the pool with a healthy salad and glass of wine, the service was great. The only complaint that I had was that I couldn't go back up to the club level again for Happy Hour since I already checked out. When I checked in it was at 8 PM, which was pretty late so I didn't get to use the club level that first night. I thought I would be able to use it up till the time that I actually checked in but it was not their policy. It was fine though, I enjoyed the spa and gym and they checked my bags safely that entire day. Overall, this hotel exceeded my expectations. The rates are a little less expensive than most of the other fine hotels in the area. I feel that my stay was worth it and my experience was one of a kind!

Accomodation in the seaside rooms is a pleasant one and the general feeling is you are getting well from your money. Never experienced a garden room. The really weak point is the price for extras, from beakfast to internet connection, not to mention a brunch or their restaurants where one really does not get what he is paying for. I am never really travelling on a budget but prices are well over a magnificent Tokyo's hotel, without getting really much.

On the other hand, the staff were friendly and hospitable as always and the roof top terrace may not be missed: it offer maybe the most spectacular view over the old city, the entrance to the Golden Horn, the Bosphorus and the exit to the Marmara Sea.

The first turnoff was the reception service. I stayed here on business because my company has a special rate with the hotel. The rate is supposed to include breakfast. When I checked in, the guy told me that my reservation did not include breakfast. Luckily I had a printout with me that proved it did. Then when he was assigning the room, I asked for a non-smoking room with a view of the Bosphorus. He told me that for a view, I had to pay an extra 40 euros. I declined because my company would not cover it. So he gave me a room on the 3rd floor. I asked for something on a higher floor, but he told me there were no more non-smoking roooms. One thing you should know is that because it's on a hill, the entrance to the hotel is on the 9th floor. So the 3rd floor was six floors down with a view of a parking lot and nothing else. I went back to the reception and asked for a higher floor, even if a smoking room. The guy told me nothing was available unless I paid 40 euros. But then I asked a young woman at the reception and she magically found me a non-smoking room at the same rate on the 15th floor. This was much better, with a decent view, but it was annoying that the first guy seemed to be misleading me in order to sell me a more expensive room. The location is the best thing about this hotel. It does overlook the Bosphorus, and it's close to the popular Nisantasi shopping area. But it's not in the old city where the main historical sites are located. And I found that Nisantasi contains many shops like Gucci and Armani that you can find anywhere else in the world. The room itself is okay, with a large bed and a small marble desk for working. But in general this hotel is in bad need of a renovation. The decor is not modern, but rather looks like 20-year-old pseudo Ottoman, with fraying carpets and peeling paint. Also, when I arrived the room reeked of cheap room deodorizer, like they were tring to cover some some foul odor. But I could barely breath and had to open a window. The other thing that annoys me about a \"luxury\" hotel like this is that you pay a lot for a room, but then they still try to squeeze you by getting you to pay ridiculous amounts for using the internet or the coffee machine in your room (if you want, bring your own Nespresso cartridges or tea bags!).", "Date": "March 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Service\u201d", "Author": "sbk225", "ReviewID": "UR98676351", "Content": "I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for 2 nights.

It was wonderful and we had a fantastic time. I organised the trip because my friends wanted me to show them the sights of Istanbul, which I know quite well. As I had stayed at Swissotel before, it was high on my list of favourites and I certainly did not regret my choice. I booked our rooms on the executive floor with access to the executive lounge on the 17th floor. We spent some time every day on the balcony there just watching the ferries on the Bosphorous below. It is one of the best views in the city in my opinion. Of course I was worried that everything would work out, so I contacted the hotel in advance to make sure our rooms were not near the elevators or roof bar and to arrange a dinner reservation for the first night. Everything was handled very professionally and quickly. Our reception at the hotel was great - we were whisked up to the 17th floor lounge and were in our rooms in minutes. The luggage arrived quickly and we were able to go to dinner right away. Next morning, breakfast in the lounge was good - out on the balcony in the sunshine. The staff were excellent, friendly and courteous. Our rooms were spacious and very clean. The housekeeping staff helped us in every way they could. One morning it rained, so we needed extra umbrellas in addition to the one already provided in the room - no problem - service with a smile. The indoor pool is great for swimming laps. The spa is beautiful with fantastic staff. The outdoor pool is very spacious for a hotel pool and there were adequate loungers positioned around it. Both pools were very clean. Any time we needed a taxi, the doorman was immediately at hand and gave us a card with the taxi's registration number on it in case we forgot something in the car or had any problems. Here I would like to mention the fact that we had no problems at all. The drivers used their taxi meters and were even prepared to drive us a very short distance when it was pouring with rain. I do speak some Turkish so maybe that helped a bit. The concierge was friendly and pleased to make reservations for us, although I chose the restaurants myself (with the help of Turkish friends). All in all, we really enjoyed our visit and I can recommend the hotel to Istanbul visitors. Certainly you have to take taxis to the sites, but Istanbul is so huge that you have to take taxis anyway, so it doesn't really matter which area you stay in. The Swissotel is located in a nice garden - which used to belong to thegrounds of the Dolmabache Palace and it is just a short stroll up to Nisantas with many restaurants and nice shops.

Maybe some rooms need a bit of renovation, but everything is extremely clean and offering you the best comfort. We stayed in a Classic corner room on the West Wing: the room is big enough to accomodate two person even for a long staying, with a useful working-table, a spacious closet and plenty of shelves and drawers. The bathroom is a good size, with a spacious marble sink and big mirrors everywhere. Maybe the only negative point is the bathtub/shower, which looks a bit old, is very slippery and let a lot of water on the floor while showering. The room was very quiet at anytime and the housekeeping service one of the best we've ever experienced: always quick, personalized and just perfect. The only minus I could find: Internet connection is not complimentary and quite expensive (6 Euros/hour or 19 Euros/day), and that goes as well for minibar and coffee in-room facilities (there is a nice Nespresso machine but it costs you a fortune to make yourself a coffee!) - I think that at the rate people are paying to stay in this hotel, maybe Internet and a coffee should be offered for free. On the other hand, you get complimentary bottled water in-room and even at the pool. The external pool is really beautiful, surrounded by the old trees of the well-kept garden and with a fantastic view over the Bosphorus. You can enjoy the sun laying in one of the different sunbeds, with towels service and a nice bar-grill where you can have a good meal without leaving the sun. There is as well an inside pool and a great fitness room. We didn't try the SPA but it looks to be high level. The hotel has several different restaurants. We had breakfast at the Swiss Cafe`, offering one of the best choice of buffet breakfast I've ever tried, that you can enjoy from a beautiful covered terrace with a spectacular view. But the best view at all is the one you can enjoy from the top roof bar (16th floors): it can turn a little windy during the night, but it is a great place to enjoy a drink.

Surprisingly, we had found that there were very few hotels with outdoor pools in Istanbul. The Swissotel is a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleading hotel of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and we expected great things. When we first arrived at the hotel we were very surprised to find an extremely high level of security - this may be because a particularly important person was staying there at that time, but none the less our car was checked for bombs, mirror scanned and the boot opened. On entering the hotel itself we then needed to pass through an airport style security scanner and carry bags were searched - rather pointless given that luggage itself wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t! Security guards abound everywhere at this hotel and I think that this is a permanent feature. The hotel is grand in the international style, it looks like it was designed in the late 70\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. Marble foyers, super smart boutiques, Bulgari, Van Cleef etc. there are about five restaurants, I think only two were open when we went, this was a disappointment as I had looked forward to the Sushi restaurant. A large roof top bar with excellent views. Awesome spa and the best hotel gym I have ever seen! IMO Too many day passes are sold to day trippers to the pool area and this is at the expense of the hotel guests, feral cats everywhere, which is Turkey I suppose. Prices are five star but not London five star - a cocktail could be had for about \u00c2\u00a315.00, you could eat simply for circa \u00c2\u00a330 a head. The Hotel is a \u00c2\u00a315.00 cab ride from most of the sites and town centre, you could walk it and I wanted to but was overruled! So. Problems. Problem 1. When we arrived from a four hour long flight we were very surprised to be told that we did not have a reservation at the Hotel. We had the paper work to prove it with us. The hotel could find no trace of our booking which had been paid for in full and at first we were asked to sit and have complimentary drinks whilst they investigated. Half an hour went by, head office was called and no booking found - we were getting and going no where. It was obvious that I was going to have to be pro active. We, myself and two of the check in staff, went to the business centre where I downloaded further info and various numbers for BA in the UK. Meanwhile I had to provide Swissotel with the number of BA in Turkey - they called and again could not find the booking. After some time I managed to get through to BA in London and had someone there email Swissotel Istanbul with further details and an agreement to cover the cost of the booking. Only then were we taken to our room. The hotel guys were very pleasant and were very willing to help - it seemed to me that they had been very badly let down by head office, BA confirmed that Swissotel had been made aware of the booking in June. I think what really shocked me and what concerns me is that a less pro-active and perhaps less \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcable\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 guest would have been left panicking and without a room somewhere in Istanbul. Swissotel seemed to reach an impasse with what they could do to find the booking. Long story short, although there was no apology, we received an upgraded room, wine and chocolates for the bother and without asking. Problem 2. Service is very inconsistent, one minute exceptional and the next bad. The hotel really should address this. You will find waiters chatting and laughing whilst you are waiting to order and then once you have ordered will return to chatting and laughing before finding time to serve you your order. Then you will find a waiter willing to continually re light candles that go out, and provide you with five candles to read by and for whom nothing could be too much trouble. Pool side service varied from appalling to OK - again really inconsistent, on one day you had to go and find someone to order drinks from, on another, a drinks trolley, cool towel trolley and even a towel laying service is provided. My point about inconsistent service is that it may be acceptable in a three star hotel but not in a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcleading hotel of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122. Problem 3. The open air roof top bar whilst amazing, plays loud thumping music until 0100 - and later I think at weekends, or so I was told. I cant speak for others but it woke me up and kept me awake and I had to telephone the desk about it - three times, it was I am told, turned down, I had to take a sleeping pill. The next day more chocolates and fruit to apologise. BUT I really would much rather have just not been woken in the first place. Management says music is limited to 90 decibels - I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know what this is, but for me anything which is loud enough to wake me is too much. If you want peace and quiet I would suggest you check the room you want is not affected by the bar\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s music. All in all a good hotel. One of the best in Istanbul - if not the best - I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know. Very clean, very friendly, very Turkish. BUT we had significant problems in only a four night stay. Ultimately I would stay again but only at a value price. If you pay rack (800 euros for our room per night according to the plaque on the wall) you will probably be very disappointed.", "Date": "August 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cWhat a terrific location and renovations are top notch!\u201d", "Author": "RobHus100", "ReviewID": "UR75871899", "Content": "Overall delighted that I stayed here and I would recommend strongly. Now, I am not used to a Swissotel being so luxurious; in my experience Swissotel franchise properties are similar to having a 3 series BMW, they are a nice, safe choice but quite uninspiring. However, this hotel firmly bucks that trend and I was really pleased to stay here. Good points - so many that they deserve a fuller mention: - the spa area has undergone a transformation - the changing facilities are top notch and the steam room, chilling room etc have an air of modern luxury. The staff are unfailingly polite, even when they are delayed from closing by a guest (repeatedly, sorry!) having a final shower. The interior pool is a work of art and quite serene. - I spent a whole relaxing Sunday by the very good pool area and didn't feel bored. The pool area and pool itself is resplendent, water not too cold or warm and the Movenpick yoghurt ice creams keep oneself cool. I guess the prices keep the riff raff away and the fellow pool loungers are appropriately polite and friendly. Quite an interesting mix of young, middle aged and young at heart people. Pool lounging varies from the usual flatbed loungers to multiple occupancy structures. - The roof bar and restaurant is styled with a modern twist and the great and beautiful people come to enjoy the magnificent views. - The tennis hardcourts are literally next to the hotel and serviced by a genuinely friendly coach, very nice person. - The young front staff are really pleasant and charming and the hotel does not have a 'stiff' feel to it, probably because all the staff from the bottom up are pleasant. - don't think I spotted any 'uncles and nieces', or 'nieces' looking for uncles during my 2 week stay - The view when entering the lobby over the Bosphorus is simply amazing. Clever use of gigantic wall windows. Congratulations, Mr hotel designer..... Not so good points - Not many bad points to count. - no free WiFi offered to guests. At prices like these and given the proliferation of netbooks, smart phones etc this should be addressed asap. - The food is an excellent standard but it is at eyewatering prices. - Located very close to a popular football stadium, the fooball fans are notoriously loud and passionate (but I didn't notice much noise in the hotel during a match.) - I had one small issue with the telephones but that was resolved by the front desk after I blindsided the pedantic middle aged 'jobsworth' that originally fielded my complaint", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "bucharest", "Title": "\u201cNot so great !

We waited for 2 hours after which we asked about the status, moment in which we received the keys. I have to say that the reception stuff was very not welcoming at all (one of the persons was talking with us and looking at his colleague), except for one gentlemen at the Concierge. We roomed around until we found our room (big hotel) as nobody could guide us to the room. After 1 hour we received the luggage in the room and after 2 previous phone calls. About the internet??!!! It is charged 6 euro/ hour or 20 euro/ day, or...... In 2010, a 5 star hotel to charge the internet is absolutely outrageous. By the way one day the internet card costed 12 Turkish lira, the next day was 12,50 lira. Funny, ain't it? The parking fee is 10 euro/ night and so on, you have the feeling that they want to charge your soap as well. The hotel is old, the same as the furniture in the rooms, in our bathroom the water was going almost intro the room at some point. One night we got up in the middle of the night because there were 2 Saint Bernards barking outside , thx God we were at the 7th floor ! I don't know what happened to the neighbors below. The good parts: everything related to the Spa (fabulous, fabulous, fabulous), pool, cleaning services, breakfast (super super good) and very nice stuff, doormen, the daily water, Turkish delight and info for the next day (weather, bla bla) brought in the room as surprise and the view (that made us feel good), as we had a Bosphorus Corner Room.

The enormous lobby was decorated in a classic, and beautifully timeless neutral theme. The service was exceptional. The food, though pricey, was great too as they had something for every nationality for that all important breakfast to get you going for the day. The spread was just amazing. They must have had at least 4 places to eat on the premises--all with views too beautiful to capture w/pics. The surprise at this hotel was the rooftop bar/cafe overlooking all of Istanbul--basically a 360 view. It had \"umbrella sails\" during the day which made you feel like you were on a cruise ship--w/multi-tiered areas, and a DJ at night in the beautiful \"blue\" bar area. The other cafes felt as though you were atop or amidst the trees. . Always an incredible view. The rooms were comfortable & spacious enough, though the beds throughout our trip through Turkey and Greece were all so hard...wish they'd do something about that. The concierge outdid himself as we had some bothersome mailings to do, but he accommodated us graciously. Great recs on restaurants too. The location of this hotel is a few minutes' walk downhill to the ferry & bus area, but you may be cabbing quite a bit anyway as so many sights are spread out in Istanbul. It really didn't matter where we stayed as there are several means of transportation at every intersection it seemed. At the end of the day, after sight-seeing in beautiful and exotic (though polluted) Istanbul, it was heaven to get back inside the doors of this relaxing hotel. We would have liked to have just hung out more at the pool and 4-star spa there if time had permitted us.

My room wasn't ready when I arrived so I wanted to use the business center but found out that it was closed because it was a Sunday which came as a surprise to me. In any case, I was advised to wait in the executive lounge and used the computer there to do work until my room was ready. I was told someone would come let me know when the room was ready but no one did so after an hour plus I went to the front desk and got my room key. Unfortunately it took over an hour for my bags to arrive after that and when they did arrive I was told \"sorry, it's mother's day, so we are busy\". I had just arrived on an overnight flight and by this time was feeling pretty gross. While staying at the hotel I was sick and it was impossible to call and talk to a concierge so I ended up having to go wait in line to speak to someone to get medicine. When the medicine arrived at my room I asked the staff to wait to see if there were instructions in English and he said there would be but when I opened the box the directions were in Turkish only. Again, I had to go up to the concierge and wait in line to get them translated. It was small hassles like this that added up and made the stay not as pleasant as I would have wanted it to be. The hotel's location is a bit isolated so you have to like to walk or take taxis to get around town, but it is quiet and the views of the Bosphorous are fantastic. The breakfast was the same every single day for a week and more variety would have been nice. The rooms are large but not very elegant.

Although most of the reviews I had read about this hotel were very positive, one questioned the rooms calling them old and tired. I have to say that although the rooms are not modern in design, they are extremelly comfortable and we found them charming - the bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in and all the amenities offered worked well. Another criticism I read was concerning extra charges and being charged for the nespresso service in the rooms as well as other charges being very expensive. This was not our experience as the nespresso service was complimentary - possibly this has changed - and we ordered room service and pool-side service a couple of times and found the rates very reasonable - they compared quite favourably with prices at local restaurants. When we payed our bill there were no hidden charges. Perhaps the highest praise for this hotel came from my partner, for whom the trip was a birthday surprise. Although he is not easily impressed he did say at one point \"All hotels should be like this.\" and I can't help but agree.", "Date": "August 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Istanbul", "Title": "\u201cBest anniversary ever\u201d", "Author": "Duckaustria", "ReviewID": "UR38122913", "Content": "Our anniversary of wedding was excellent.

Never mind we thought we will be moving to our Bosphorous View the next day. When we got retuned from a trip into the old town the next day our bags had been very efficiently moved to our new room - at last a view of the.... rooftop tennis court - you could see the Bosphorous but only if you stood in one corner of the room This time we complained and were shown a room on the same elevation but 4 floors down - a view of the road! Eventually we took up our case with the manager who told us that all bosphorous view rooms were partial view rooms unless you booked the more expensive corner room or suite. To be fair we were moved to a corner room with a fabulous view of the Bosphorous - finally we had what we thought we had paid for - but be careful about booking a standard room if you want a good view. The staff were generally excellent (especially the conciege team who found us a great reastuarant for our anniversary) as was the Spa Facility which really did provide a great way to wake up in the morning. The resaturants and bars good but were crazy money to the point of being prohibitive - 50 lira for 2 G&T's and 60 lira for 2 cocktails - but then we found this generally to be the case in Istanbul. We had taken 2 bottles of champagne with us purchased at the airpot (it was our anniversary!) and I would certainly recoomed that you take some alcohol with you. The location was pretty good with a cool modern district close by which was great for breakfast cafes, restaurants & bars full of locals and top brand shopping. The old town was easily reached by taxi the first morning but after that we used the very simple linear tram line which cost about 60p each and was a much better experience than a taxi.

The room was large, clean, beautifully furnished, with large bathroom and lots of closet/storage space. The towels were changed twice a day, and the turkish delight with the turn-down service was a nice touch. The breakfast area is beautiful, with a wide variety of options from American-style to continental to Turkish and even Japanese. The hostesses were always very pleasant, and the coffee/water service prompt. We had a couple of urgent requests for dry cleaning and pressing service (was there for a wedding) and everything was taken care of very promptly. Throughout our stay, everyone from the cleaning staff to the concierge to waiters seemed to enjoy helping guests and really made our stay memorable. The location is convenient, with quick and cheap taxi service anywhere (the taxi staff were also very helpful, explaining directions to the drivers and giving us the taxi plate numbers for each ride) - but I wouldn't walk anywhere from the hotel, since the sidewalk goes down a steep hill and it is not well paved. Overall, I will absolutely stay at this hotel when in Istanbul again - especially if I can get that rate again!", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "los angeles", "Title": "\u201cWorth the price\u201d", "Author": "mayla", "ReviewID": "UR8601707", "Content": "You can sit in this hotel and watch the entire world go by.

We also liked its location very much. We had, what they call, a standard room with a view on the Bosphorus, and it was so big, so well kept, so well lit, with all the essential amenities (among which, bathrobes and slippers) and so well serviced that we enjoyed every minute of our stay. The breakfast buffet was one of the best we had in similar-class hotels, and they serve it in a lovely terrace with a view on the Bosphorus! Security is evident througout the hotel and during all day and night and the service is friendly and efficient. All in all it was a memorable stay. If I go to Istanbul again, I will definitely stay at the Swisshotel!", "Date": "August 11, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cmixed feelings\u201d", "Author": "dokanman", "ReviewID": "UR7973513", "Content": "Booked on hotel website and not having been to IST for 20 years requested car to pick me up at airport. Arrived airpot- no car. Waited 10-15 minutes (I didn't have hotel no. on me) and got a taxi, which was surprisingly very straightforward and honest compared to my last visit in the 80s. At check in told I had been upgraded to a club floor where I would find a lounge for breakfast, evening drinks etc. BUT if i wanted to use the lounge....... the receptionist launched into a sales pitch that for a modest charge etc. I was being hustled by check in!!!! I reminded him that I'd just spent 15 minutes waiting for their NO SHOW driver at airport, and I'd go and stay elsewhere. The lounge access was then given free of charge. SWISS HOSPITALITY!!! Wifi access is unnescessarily complicated and frustratingly difficult to access. Is this a business hotel or stop of point for americans on expensive package tours? Very pleasant, if busy pool area. Good food too, albeit weighted in favour of US carb bomb style. Room OK. Very good housekeeping service. Overall? Good enough, but propensity to nickle and dime - staff appear to have been on over intensive \"up selling\" classes at the expense of leaving the impression of any genuine hospitality. I suspect that there are better options elsewhere.
