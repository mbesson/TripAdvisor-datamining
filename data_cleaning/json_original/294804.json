The hotel is in a lovely little street with many restaurants, a convenience store on the corner and a travel agent. The rooftop breakfast room was amazing. Apart from the great continental breakfast the views were wonderful. It was worth paying a little extra for a Superior Deluxe room which gave us a bit more space and and windows overloking the street. We booked directly with the hotel via their website and got a discount....maybe because of the length of our stay I'm not sure. Yes the toilet in the bathroom clogged up a few times and cable conncetion on the tv was iffy but they got fixed and were only small glitches in the wonderful stay.

Together with 4 Seasons, Uyan Hotel are the 2 closest hotels to the Sultanahmet area. It literally took us a 2 minute walk to reach either Ayasofya or Sultanahmet. I also loved the view from the side we walked to the main square from as it was great. How I would have loved to live during the Ottoman times. The hotel manager was very quick and detailed in all their email responses. Nearing our trip I realised we needed to have a large suitcase stored somewhere in Istanbul till I returned back to Istanbul as we would be staying in Istanbul at the end of our trip so we asked the hotel if they could store the large suitcase and they were only too happy to oblige at no cost. This made us happy and the hotel already had a plus in our minds. I chose this hotel based upon the internet reviews I had read and believe me none of them were wrong and we are glad we chose this hotel. Their breakfasts were delicious. They had a great roof top terrace eating area which has a great view. The hotel staff were extremely helpful, approachable and friendly in assisting with all of our queries. The hotel is in a very quiet location and street noise or other annoying noises were nonexistent. The only noise there was is the beautiful call of prayer to the mosque to which we accepted. Because we stayed at the hotel for 5 nights we were entitled to an airport transfer which we utilised upon arrival there. Our plane was delayed to which we told the hotel and they advised their driver has access to the arrival details and would be waiting for us at arrivals. We arrived at the domestic terminal of Istanbul airport but had to go to the international terminal to sort something out so the hotel gave us the driver\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s number where we arranged to meet at an alternative place which worked out well. Definitely will stay at this place on our next visit to Istanbul and can highly recommend it to others considering a hotel in the Sultanahmet area of Istanbul.

The staff is very kind and the building itself very decorative. Living in New York and traveling through western Europe often, I've begun to truly appreciate a hotel that provides genuine living space, and Uyan provides just such space--provided you reserve a \"Standard\" room or better. I peaked into the \"Small Single\" room and it looked pretty cramped--perhaps for a traveling student or longtime studio dweller these would be fine, but for a man of my size (6'8\") and temperment (grouchy and bitter), I'm glad I went with the standard. The windows open out onto the city street, meaning you get to look out at whatever's below, but also that whatever's below will wake you up. And believe me, it will wake you up. There was a man who came through the street collecting trash on a wheel barrel yelling something in Turkish--it was like the \"Bring Out Your Dead\" scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail; this happened around 9:30 every day. The roof offers a restaurant and beautiful views of the Haghia Sofia and Blue Mosque--make sure you don't miss it. This place is located just behind both of the aforementioned landmarks, placing it front-and-center amongst tourist sites. This can be a traveler's dream or nightmare. As a traveler who prefers the nightlife and feel of the \"real\" city, this was a little removed from everything--Beyoglu and Istiklal Caddesi are far away, and even that area is a \"tourist\" hotspot. For the real nightlife you have to take the ferry over to Kadikoy on the Asian side, which is quite a trek on the public transit system.

It is located in the famous heart of their eastern side of the city, close to the H. Sophia and the Blue Mosque, the Ottoman Palace -not far from the strait (that divided Europe from Asia) and the city's main tourist attractions. Located in a highly touristy area it may be more expensive than other options in less popular neighborhoods. Upon registering, what first struck me was the fascinating somber, deep and loud raspy Muslim \"call to prayer\" emanating from the Blue Mosque....at the front desk, they'll politely ask you to sit down \"for a brief introduction\" of the hotel. At first, I thought It was a nice touch, they'll serve you warm tea and cookies. However, after 30 minutes of being \"introduced\" to its services, after flying for 13 hrs - I was beyond antsy to get away from the reception lobby area and onto my bedroom. I politely cut off the lingering red carpet welcome and sped away. The rooms are nice, but pretty standard - clean, medium sized with a spartan version of the amenities we are used to in the US. i.e- tiny soap, shampoo, few large sized towels. Shower sprinkled water everywhere outside its limits, so be prepared to repeatedly ask for towels to dry up the pool of water waiting to be formed by the sink and toilet. it was a mess. Unfortunately, I did not ask for a room with a view, preferably of Istanbul's grand structures standing right before my nose, so make sure to insist for \" a room facing the strait - the beds were comfortable and the pillows soft. However, given the hotel's location, in my room - it was brighter that expected at night with the curtains fully drawn. Not a big deal, but a bit annoying. DO NOT MISS having breakfast on the outside terrace overlooking the city's grand structures, it is by far breath taking and impressive. when out and about, I recommend you leave your bulky hotel key at the reception. If you need a cab, they'll call one for you - however, given the city's touristy location - they'll tend to overcharge. Make SURE to forcefully negotiate rate \"before\" hopping on, otherwise you will definitely be ripped off. When flagging a cab from downtown to hotel - follow the same mentioned rule - and don't be intimidated by Turks' often colorful, expressive mannerisms - they are not being rude.

We arrived at the hotel shortly after 9AM and we were so impressed that our room was ready - we had expected to be able to drop our bags but have to return much later to actually get to the room. Not only that, but they upgraded us to their \"Blue Mosque\" room as it had a balcony and there were none available for our category of room. The one side of the room was all windows and most opened as well as the patio door so we were able to really enjoy the sights and sounds from our room. The room was large and we looked directly across to the Blue Mosque and also see the water. We also had the big jacuzzi tub in the bathroom. The a/c worked great and was very quiet. We were on the fourth floor so just down the hall from the breakfast dining room. We almost missed the fact that there was a door leading to the roof and there are several tables up there to enjoy a great view and breeze while you eat.

We also sat up there one evening and no one was there and we enjoyed a beautiful breeze.

In terms of the actual stay, our room was clean enough to perform open heart surgery in, and comfortable enough to make it hard to get up in the morning. When we finally did manage to escape from our beds in the morning, we were invariably provided with an excellent, healthy breakfast, and virtually anything else we asked for. This latter point is a crucial feature of the hotel: Both my friend and I agreed that the staff at this hotel were vastly superior to any we had ever stayed at. It seemed like they knew everything! How to get places, what would be safe and fun to do, you name it. I suppose that a wealthy tourist might prefer to stay at the intercontinental, or the four seasons which is directly adjacent.

The Spice Market was a bit further (about 20 minutes) but you could also easily take the tram one or both ways.

This turned out to be a good thing as it was pretty quiet (other than during the call to prayer, which given the closeness to the Blue Mosque was loud), overlooked some green space, stayed cool (despite 30 degree weather) and was definitely a good size, especially the tub/shower. The wiresless internet connection was very good and available 24/7. One small complaint was that the room, although clean, could use some upkeep as there was paint peeling off the wall above the bed.

The cavenous stairway and foyer amplified the noise, so that I felt we were sleeping just inside the front door. I complained next morning and requested another room.

The taxi driver had a hard time finding it, but after asking a few people on the street, we arrived. We got there fairly late, and the manager was very friendly and accomodating. He brought us water and checked us in. The hotel is very quaint and on a nice little street near the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. It is also close by to the tram and within walking distance to the Grand Bazaar (10 mins). Our room was on the second floor of the 4 floor building. It was clean, old, slightly smelly. The TV worked by pressing the #6. Overall, for the money, I would say it is a good deal. Breakfast in the morning is good - fresh bread, cheese, juice, coffee. The view from the terrace is incredible. Every morning you will get a wake up call from the mosque around 6am. That at first was shocking, but we got used to it. If we went back to Istanbul, we would probably stay there again. But this time, I would make sure to be more assertive with the desk clerk. A few words of warning about the hotel and Istanbul: When checking in, the manager pulled out a map and showed us where we were and where the main attractions were. When I checked out, he charged me for the map! He never asked me if I wanted a map. Second, they have a nice trick in Istanbul, and I was sadly upset to see the manager pulled it on us. Unfortunately, Istanbul uses both the Turkish Lira and the Euro. They tend to quote prices in Lira and then charge Euros (about 40-50% higher). The manager arranged a car to take us to the airport and said it would cost 20 Lira. When we got there, the guy charged us 20 Euro. This was typical there, and you MUST be careful. Also, the hotel offered us help with some sightseeing tours. We took one that went down the Bosphorus and to the Spice Market with SHE tours. This was a TOTAL waste of money. We could have gotten in a taxi and gone down to the Spice Market and walked around on our own and then gotten on a fairy for one quarter of the cost. The guide offered no colorful info at all. ALSO, do not believe a merchant when they tell you that you can go to the local post office and buy a nice thick box to send your things that you purchase home in. We bought some nice Turkish plates, and were told that we could send our things home through the post. (We were also told this about a rug we purchased). First of all, the post does NOT sell boxes. Secondly, you can only ship things max 5kg. SO, always have the merchant ship for you. Believe me, it will save you a huge headache and a lot of money. When bargaining in Istanbul, immediately cut the price in half and always make sure you understand that the currency they are bargaining in is Lira.", "Date": "December 1, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Coral Springs, FL", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel at a Great Location\u201d", "Author": "bos2677", "ReviewID": "UR11135415", "Content": "The Hotel Uyan is a botique hotel located between the Hagia Sophia and the Blue mosque.

It also fell into the top end of our price range which has always gotten us a good room in a nice hotel. (We have used this website for booking hotels with success on several occasions) one of the comments on the website was about the call to prayer which we fully expected. Having visited a number of middle eastern countries we are used to it. Nothing prepared us, however, for the incredible sound coming at us at 4:30 in the morning. We expected the windows to be fully sealed, they are not, and you should all be aware that you will hear the entire call to prayer as if it was being delivered outside your window. We arrived late (expected) and the desk manager was friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious and clean although the decor screamed the 1950s (serioulsy right out of some weird movie). However, the location was good so we were very pleased. Upon arrival we were given a brochure for day trips in and around the city. When we checked with the desk clerk about these he gave us a different brochure telling us IT was a better company. The prices were the same so we tried to book two tours. One was of the Asian side of Istanbul and the other to Bursa. The first tour was no problem. The day desk clerk told us the second might not go, but it should be okay, she would call back within the hour and let us know.... We had to keep after her for TWO days and kept suggesting that we find another tour if that wasn't going to be held. Finally, when it was too late to get another tour she told us the trip to Bursa was cancelled and she actually said there were no tours at all being held anymore for the following day (does that sound credible to you? I didn't think so) . Needless to say we were disappointed. The only thing they were excited about booking us into was the show at the Galata Tower, which as it turns out they get a commision for. Although the performance was fun, it is absolutely not worth the price and the food make us sick. We ate at many other restaurants and we were fine. Also, after the first few days the maid stopped fully cleaning the room. Glasses we had used were left uncleaned on the counter where we left them and some powered sugar that spilled on a table when opening some Turkish Delight sat there for two days. She also did not change the sheets and only sporadically refilled the mini-bar. Basically, all she did was make the bed and change the towels. Upon check-out we tried to pay for our mini-bar bill and our car to the airport with credit card. Apparently they don't take credit cards!!??!! We gave cash and asked for an itemized bill since it seemed to be a little high and we weren't sure how much we had actually used. The clerk said she didn't have a bill but would prepare one for us to have when we returned to pick up the car for the airport. I'm sure nobody is surprised that there was no bill waiting for us when we got back to the hotel. We didn't get a chance to ask for it because we were making sure that our luggage (which had sat in their lobby under the watchful? eye of the clerk all day) was intact and present. Ironically enough while we were riding the airport they called the driver to see if he picked up an extra bag because one had gone missing from the lobby. We are 85% sure we were overcharged on the final bill but were so glad to leave the hotel it was worth it. Does this sound like a rant? Yes it does! Take my advice and don't stay at this hotel.

I found all of the front desk personnel to be very helpful, especially Osman. As others have noted, the location is excellent for sightseeing. Most tourists sites in Sultanahmet are within walking distance. In short, I cannot think of anything that the hotel could have done to improve my stay. It was a very enjoyable vacation.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cAsk for the sea view rooms on 4th floor\u201d", "Author": "savvychic-travels", "ReviewID": "UR6175274", "Content": "I stayed here 4 nights in July 2006 and we had the opposite experience of the last two reviewers. The driver not only met me at the airport but when I mentioned that I liked to fish, he drove me through the fish market on the way to the hotel so I could see the fresh catch that morning. He'd slow down and shout out to people in Turkish, \"hey how much for that one?\" and then he'd tell me in a very animated voice how expensive a bass or flounder-type fish was as I hung out the car window gawking at the stands. Our standard room on the 4th floor (401 or 403?) was flooded with light and very lovely with a view of the water in the distance. These rooms on the higher floors are not the \"deluxe\" renovated rooms and so were fairly inexpensive -- IIRC we paid 82 Euro after the cash discount (we booked directly through the hotel website) and had two twin beds. We were also offered the cute room next to us which had a tiny and very cute balcony -- that room only had one double bed, however, so we couldn't take it. I'd suggest you ask for the room with the balcony and sea view if you're a couple. Loved the hardwood floors in these rooms and the bathrooom looked newly tiled and was immaculate although there was a moldy smell that wouldn't go away. A/C/ worked great and there was a mini-bar fridge with room for our drinks and fruit. Service was relatively efficient and very friendly -- personally greeted in the mornings and afternoons by the hotel owner's son who did much of the renovation. The staff in the morning breakfast room were very accomodating and made us turkish coffee in the mornings when they saw we didn't enjoy the watered-down American coffee. Staff chatted with us on a daily basis about our plans and answered all our questions and they were happy to store our luggage on the day of check-out and even put our laptops in a locked office when we voiced worries about leaving our luggage behind. The rooftop is as beautiful as it looks on their website and like everyone else says, location is very central and their buffet breakfast is very good with many options. Sorry and surprised to hear that people had problems with service -- was it one particular person you were dealing with? The older front desk guy was friendly and efficient, the younger guy who took our luggage up was also very friendly and jovial but didn't seem able to do much about our concerns with the mold smell in the bathrooom -- he said it would air out if we kept the fan on. Overall, we had a great time here and would definitely stay again.", "Date": "November 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stratford-upon-Avon, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cpoor cutomer care\u201d", "Author": "starjohnday", "ReviewID": "UR6149802", "Content": "We booked a 4 night stay at the Uyan hotel in October through Venere and after arranging the complimentary shuttle service from the airport to the hotel (by Email and confirming by phone) we where disappointed to find nobody at the airport to meet us, after locating a phone and waiting a further 1/2 hour we where eventually picked up. The room (205) we were assigned was the standard Deluxe which was clean and tidy even though there was no satellite reception to the TV. We complained about this and I believe as a token gesture the bell boy was sent to our room to say that they would get a tecnichen up to our room to fix it. As an ex TV engineer I could see that the room was not wired for Satellite and that the bell boy was sent to ''placate the tourists''. In view of this lack of customer care and having no faith that my complaint/issue would be resolved I could not be bothered to report the shower tray that constantly leaked and took 10 minutes to drain. In my mails and confirmation calls to the hotel I had made it known that the trip was both a wedding anniversary and birthday celebration in the hope that the hotel would at least place some flowers in our room (which I would have been happy to pay for) but no that was obviously too much to ask for. The only positive I can add to this review is that the location of this hotel is perfect for the sights and the breakfast is to a good standard; just don't expect good customer care.", "Date": "November 18, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cairo", "Title": "\u201cPoor, poor staff\u201d", "Author": "fromdenile", "ReviewID": "UR6124159", "Content": "We were booked to stay at the Uyan Hotel for 6 nights in early October.

The next morning, we asked about the change and were then told it would be impossible (even though we had 5 nights remaining) as they were fully booked. At the time of this conversation, two separate couples were waiting to check out. When I told the Uyan staff that we would have to find other accomodations if they were unable to change our room, they just shrugged their shoulders.

It also benefits from bei\u00c4\u00b1ng very close to the Four Seasons Hotel which has bars and restaurants that are open. The staff at the hotel were generally friendly and charming although this could not make up for their general lack of competence and experience. The rooms were newly (though very simply) furnished and the bathrooms were new and very clean. After booking and prepaying our room in advance through Expedia. we were dumbfounded to be told on arrival that the hotel was full and that we would be staying in the inferior hotel next door. Having made clear that we were not prepared to stay next door the manager suggested that our friends, due to arrive later on in the afternoon, would stay next door! After lengthy conversations and a call to the local Expedia office they eventually found a room by moving the belongings of some of their other guests into storage whilst they were temporarily away.These guests were later to be seen complaining at reception. Our so called 'deluxe' room had a view of a stack of 10 broken toilets and a large back wall. We were woken in the morning by heavy traffic down the uncarpeted corridor outside our room.

The location was very central and was within easy walking distance to all the major sites to see in the old part of the city, and in a very safe area. The Four Season Hotel is right next door.

Decorated amazingly, nice bed, gorgeous brand new looking bathroom. Amazing. Granted our last two days when they moved us back to the small room..it is SMALL! You can barely move.

Prior to my trip I looked at numerous web sites at various hotels. Because I flew on a frequent flier ticket ($91 RT international business class from Knoxville, TN) I felt that I could pay a little more to stay in an upscale hotel rather than in places like I normally stay, NOT as upscale as the Four Seasons though which is three times the price at their lowest rate and only 30 meters away! I had no outside recommendations for the hotel. From the time the shuttle picked me up at the airport (n/c too) after my long flight from Knoxville, TN to when the shuttle took me back to the airport at 3 AM for my departure my hotel experience was excellent. I was met with a friendly and helpful staff, Genghis (not spelled correctly, sorry) was all smiles every time I saw him and at breakfast too, he even made an omlette for me for breakfast even though he didn't for other guests. All I did was ask! My superior deluxe room was fantastic, room 302, on the front of the building, no noise, had the windows open and heard the calls to prayer at night, the room was spotless, vistas fantastic from the roof, the king size bed and down comforter begged me to relax, M. Uyan actually exists too, he's a extremely nice grandfather type man who was so cordial to me I felt like family. And he told me that hotel guests receive a 40% discount at his rug and ceramics store next door. There are good restaurants close to the hotel even though the reviews said that there are not. Believe me, I didn't go hungry! Be sure to go out the front door, turn left to the corner, and left immediately to the restaurant on the left. It was popular and has good foods too. And the rooms have a mini refrig so you can buy yogurt or something at the store rather than eating out all the time, or when you get hungry late at night, or if you don't want to go up to the 4th floor for their excellent breakfast. Like every other hotel though, the prices for the items (sodas and beer) in the refrig are high, so just go to the store! The location is excellent, everything from the sea to the historial places, to the Galata Bridge, to the University, the Grand Bazaar, and the Hippodrome is within walking distance. This was my first trip to Turkey, I didn't know what to expect. I didn't expect the friendliness in general, and was rather annoyed at being approached on the streets for the invariable hustle of some sort, but I became used to it and could avoid it. I always take Knoxville chocolates with me when I travel (the owner of the chocolate factory is a friend) because I'd rather give something that is more personal than a tip could possibly be. And Genghis said that everyone said they were really good too. A little friendliness in return to the staff in the hospitality industry is always more than welcomed. I met wonderful people on the trip ranging from a couple from Texas, people from Istanbul, Kurdish Istanbul residents, and all without exception were friendly and I felt welcomed and comfortable at all times. My hat is off to Mr. Uyan, the Uyan Hotel, and it's staff for making this a remorable vacation for me.
