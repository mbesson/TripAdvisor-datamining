The parking lot was very tiny and tucked away around the corner so that was my first worry. The lobby was clean and bright and the young man that assisted us was very friendly and willing to accommodate when we asked for a smoking room (ok I know! ) After a ride in a tiny elevator we found , our room was at the end of the hall, right next to a fire escape door that was propped open.This building is very old and I think was a studio apartment house in it's younger days. Building materials were propped against the walls in the hallway and it smelled musty and slightly of curry. In our room large cracks adorned the walls, paint was peeling from the door frames,there was no phone, the heater was right against one of the beds, slats broken and didn't work on the heat setting. The carpet was old and dirty. The bathroom was ancient, cracked tiles and the toilet was up on a raised platform. There was a little kitchenette but the light didn't work. It didn't seem too clean, but there was a working fridge and two microwaves. I went to the lobby to ask for an ashtray and was told that you couldn't smoke in the building because it would smell up the hallways,but out on the fire escape, which is why I guess that door was propped open. This led me to feel unsafe as anyone could come up the fire escape stairs and into the building virtually unseen. I worried about bed bugs, the mattress were very hard and the pillows flat.I took pictures on my cell phone but need to get a cord to download them to my computer.

Instead of stopping along the way, we decided to drive all the way down last minute. After being in the car for 10 hours with two young children we found out that our original hotel the Hyatt Regency Mission Bay was completely booked that night. I tried calling all the other hotels in the area but they were all completely booked for the night also. So, I decided to call hotels.com and ask for some help in searching for a hotel for my family just for one night before we check into the Hyatt the next day. The lady on the phone told us that she found a \"great hotel\" for us in downtown San Diego with a view of the harbor and it's luckily the same cost as the Hyatt. It sounded good on the phone and I put my trust in her to help my family out because we were all exhausted from the road trip. After I got off the phone with her I checked the hotel on trip adviser and found out it was not a good fit for our family. I called hotels.com back and they would not allow us to change hotels. We had no other choice but to go to the hotel and check in. The front desk lady looked at me crazy when I asked for a room with a king instead of one queen. She said, \"WE HAVE NO KINGS HERE!\", like it was a stupid question. My family of 4 piled into this \"suite\" with one queen and a smelly old sofa bed and I wanted to cry. It had a nasty dingy smell and the carpet was wet in the living area of the room. It was really gross and I couldn't wait to leave the next day. I was told by hotels.com that it had a view of the harbor and we only had a view of the parking lot. In fact, I don't think any of the rooms had a view at all. We heard cars honking and airplanes flying over us all night. My two little girls had a really hard time sleeping. I can't believe hotels.com took advantage of us like that. I'll never use them again. This room was the same price as the Hyatt?

There are only two positive things about the hotel. One is the location, couldn't complain about that other than the street was very noisy and the planes fly directly overhead (and I mean to the point where you feel they are going to land on your room) until well after midnight. Other than that, it is close to excellent places to eat, transportation, freeway and the harbour. The other was aside from the up charging that the hotel staff does, they were very accommodating and friendly and as helpful as they were able to be. The hotel smelled and was old and uncared for. The room was disgusting. I asked for a non smoking and got one that had been covered up with highly allergenic air freshner. There was mould in the fridge, old food in the drawers, cracked walls, cracked casing that had come off and was just banged into place again. The kitchenette had a sink and fridge, no cutlery or dishes and the sink was completely corroded. The windows didn't close properly, likely original ones. The bathroom was old, fixtures were chipped, towels frayed, no kleenex, the cheapest soap I have ever seen. Beds were ok, no bed bugs or cockroaches but when I stripped off the sheets to check the mattresses, there were old blood stains on the mattress cover. Breakfast was a joke, coffee with creamer, toast, frozen waffles. Might as well lower the rate and not have breakfast. Everything was an up charge, with a \"resort\" fee (of course there was no resort) and extra for another bed. When my friends and family called the staff was indifferent and never offered to take a message. There was no voicemail so that wasn't an option either. All in all a dismal experience for what Hotwire rates as a 2 star hotel. I would maybe give them a 1 star for location. Sad because the hotel has tons of potential with some of the original finishes and could be a gem in a fantastic location. The grande dame has let herself go!! I would not recommend this hotel to any but the most indifferent or adventurous people who don't care where they lay their head down to sleep!

One reviewer ended his/her report stating that somebody should be reported to some authority, and I completely agree. This is not a two star place to stay, no way. Where to start? The inn is dirty, worn out (its site reads \"remodeled\", give me a break), rooms so small, that the relatively cheap price turns our expensive. Towels are always two, very small and thin. If you ask the lady that owns the business, the one at the front desk, for more towels, she automatically smiles and asks for money for extra people, even though we already paid for the two queen beds room. Next, rooms have cigarette odors. In the morning, if you go to the kind of lobby, you find coffee instead of the \"continental breakfast\" they claim to give. The funny lady notices you and runs to the kitchen to cut cheap chocolate cupcakes, which we haven't tried but looked old, on a dirty tray. No, thanks. Many more...

When she saw me leaving she agreed to give the room at the price of $49.95 for the first two nights and 84.95 for the weekend. I was given a very old dirty smelly room at south side of the building that had a kitchen! The kitchen has a Microwave and Fridge. No stove or anything else. No dishes! The cabinets were very dirty and some broken. Then I noticed that the bathroom doesn\u2019t even have a exhaust fan. I wanted to stay 2 nights and cancel the weekend.

Then I told her that they have charged me $11 extra! She said that it\u2019s $2.5 per day charge to use my credit card!!! That was funny! Then I told that it\u2019s still $10! Why did you charge me 11.02! She said that it\u2019s 2.52 something and she doesn\u2019t know exactly how much it is!!! She was making that up! I asked why she didn\u2019t tell me and told her that I could pay cash to avoid paying $2.5 per day! She said that there is no need to tell the guests about these charges. $11 is nothing!

If you want a low cost place to stay, try anywhere else.", "Date": "February 27, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Texas", "Title": "\u201cshut this one down.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4243244", "Content": "I stayed here one night and had to cancel the other two nights because my plans changed. I knew the policy rules and was prepared to lose the remaining money I spent on the reservation...no problem. I went to the lobby and spoke directly with the main manager just as I did upon arrival, and instead of a queen he offered me a king sized bed at no extra cost. I told him I had to leave early, I apologized and handed him the hotel swipe card. He mentioned that when EXPEDIA called he would let them know we talked and he agreed to give a refund. When I returned home and called to see if the matter was cleared, I was told the manager was not around, he was in conference calls, or he was dealing with other customers. This went on for 3 days. Finally I gave it one last try. When I called I was told that the manager told EXPEDIA that I didn't turn in my key, left without telling them and he couldn't rent out the room to other guests. All that was needed was to say he didn't want to give the refund, where did all the anger come from?", "Date": "December 14, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0", "Rooms": "1", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas", "Title": "\u201cSo bad, we checked out before checking in\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3375717", "Content": "After booking this place over a month in advance (and not bothering to read reviews before hand, my bad), I arrived with my girlfriend, knowing the place had some bad reviews (i found this website the night before our trip). My girlfriend asked the nice Eastern lady at the desk to see a room before we checked in. We got the key for one that had an outside entrance (not safe), the toilet wasn't working, there was standing water in the bottom of the refrigerator and it smelled of mold. So back to the front desk to ask for a refund. The lady was very cooperative (I think this happens a lot) and promised not to bill us and called the parent company. I talked with the guy for a few minutes, answered the usual questions (what's wrong with the room) and was told they'd notify me within 5 days if I was getting a refund or not. I was shocked that upon return from my vacation, about 5 days later, I got an email confirming my refund (I confirmed that with my credit card company). So, I got my money back and hope everyone spends a bit more money and go one block to the Super 8.

We stayed here prior to a cruise and had reservations here when we returned. We arrived early after the cruise and were told our room was not ready but they would keep the luggage and put it in the room for us. That evening when we returned to the hotel I was told that I had not prepaid Hotels.com for the room. When I showed them the receipt they gave us the key to the room but called Hotels.com. Hotels.com phoned us several times during that night, telling us first that I had cancelled the reservation earlier in the week. This was not true. Then the front desk called wanting us to leave $20.00 on the dresser when we left, supposedly to pay for a balcony attached to the room -- if that is what one could possibly call it. Finally Hotels determined that the hotel planned to charge us $199 that night instead of the prepaid rate of $90, and of course, the hotel had been the one to cancel the reservation. I want to commend Hotels.com for working for two days on our behalf to force the hotel to only charge the $90.00.
