The only bad thing that I will say about the hotel will be is about the cleanliness of the swimming pool. Although is a very big pool and is only 3 to 4 feet tall. Not having the pool clean was not a good experience and the water was very shadow and it look that it need more chemicals. In the morning someone was cleaning the pool but he just clean the sand and didn't put a lot of effort to really clean the water and by 11am when we tried the pool it it was still dirty and with a lot of things floating in the water and the water was very shadow. Overall everything is great and excellent. We use more the beach which was great.

The clerk that checked us out never thanked us for staying with them. The hotel is \"tired\", and not being kept up well. Weeds in the gardens, chipped tile, and plumbing in our room that did not work well (running toilet) were some of my observations. They didn't provide face cloths with the linens, which I didn't like. The music at the pool was \"Techno latin\" which drove me nuts. I couldn't sit at the pool for long. These little things all added up. On a positive note, our room was quiet and comfortable, and clean. The hotel is situated in a convenient location, and has a pool with a swim up bar.

The poor tourists stayed since they probably had no idea where to go for service. We might has wasted some time but in the end free market justice set things right. The resort did not get my purchase and given that I am a local, they also lost my future purchases because it will be a long time before I give them another chance. But the tragic thing is that the tourists will probably - and justifiably - leave with a poor impression of PR and its hospitality. They will tell their friends and maybe even go as far as leaving a review here. And see, for all of us living here in the island, that is a big loss.

The employees are pleasant and helpful (when you can get ahold of someone) but the overall feel of the place was just ok. The room was just cleaned prior to our arrival (in fact we had to wait for it) and it was apparent that bleach is the cleaner of choice! The blankets/sheets were questionably clean and I had to hunt throughout the entire hotel for plastic bags for the trash cans. The pool was nice, with a great (little) kids section only a foot deep. The \"continental\" breakfast is decent if it's included in your room. Which I found out was just more expensive if you buy it with the room! Definitely not worth $10 a person considering it's bagels, toast, fruit and deli meat. The lunch menu at the pool bar is decent but overpriced. The chicken quesadilla is great, good fruity drinks, and the bartenders speak English which was helpful. We were there in early Dec (wed-thu nights) so it was very slow! I think they had 4 rooms booked in the entire place and we had a hard time finding staff at times. Overall it's definitely the \"resort\" of Rincon. But don't expect much as Rincon is very small and \"remote\". Could be an expensive trip if you stay a while! There are several small \"hotels\" and guest houses available as an alternative option. I met the owners of Dos Angeles Del Mar guest house and they are WONDERFUL! John and Yolanda (originally from Jersey!) were so helpful with information, directions, recommendations for restaurants, and even first aid after I split my eye open surfing!

Overall, it was fine but I wouldn't rave about it to others. Our rooms were nice but nothing special. I did enjoy having a balcony and a fridge in the room. The staff members were nice, but certainly not overly eager to help. Apparently, we went during slow season, which I think gave us a less impressive experience. For example, during our entire stay the internet was down and never fixed, the restaurant was closed, the wine bar was closed, the gift shop was closed, etc etc etc. My biggest gripe was the music at the pool bar - it started around 11am and went until dinnertime each night. It was loud, bad, and just plain annoying. It made it very difficult to relax by the pool, and you could even hear it all the way at the beach - incredibly annoying. Also, they chain the beach chairs together, so you can't really move them around to where you want to sit - also annoying. That all being said, the pool bar has the best mojitos ever! Absolutely delish (although overpriced). Food was good - great cobb salads and burgers/sandwiches (although again, overpriced). Breakfast was lacking at best - they have a buffet and like to let you think that spending $14 on it is your only option. It's not - just ask for the a la carte menu. Coffee at breakfast is free - that was very nice! In general, I would absolutely recommend a vacation to Rincon! I went with my husband and 2 friends, all of whom are surfers, and I am not. The beaches are gorgeous though, and I was happy to just lay out while they were in the water. Nightlife is fun and there's plenty to do. We did happy hour at Calypso a few nights - it's an absolute must if you go to Rincon! Shipwrecked was great for dinner (get the mofongo!!), as was Pool Bar, Tamboo Tavern, and the tapas bar at Casa Islena. Rincon Tropical (right across from Rincon of the Seas) was great for authentic food. As another reviewer mentioned, there is a supermarket within walking distance, too.

I should have followed my gut instinct, and stayed in San Juan, and stayed here for the night of the wedding. We drove a great deal, but there really nothing in the area that is worth seeing.

There are several reasons you will want to stay here: 1) Ammenities The pool bar was delicious and always had bartenders, the pool was clean and had very few people and always open beach chairs, and the beach was steps away and gorgeous. 2) Location Steps away from Villa Cofresi for great dinners and happy hours, close to Sugar chef for great ice cream, walking distance to grocery stores and bakery. The only places you probably need to drive are The Spot for lunch and the Lazy Parrot for dinner. 3) Privacy Villa Cofresi was packed, Rincon of the Seas was not. We felt like we had our own private vacation, where we could choose if we wanted to have peace and quiet at our hotel or lively bar scene just down the beach. **If you are looking for a luxury hotel, this is not necessarily the place for you, but if you want a romantic and wonderful spot, this is the place!!", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Piedras, PR", "Title": "\u201cI loved it!\u201d", "Author": "viajera00771", "ReviewID": "UR54028822", "Content": "The rooms where clean, the gardens where beautiful, the pool and wetbar where just very relaxing.

First of all, It is too expensive. They have a $500 per weekend which only includes two breakfasts, which by the way, were ok. Do not expect a grandeur room; it is just a standard room, with not too comfortable beds not too nice bathtubs and not to cool air conditioners. For $500 a weekend, I expected a plasma TV, but all they have is an old type TV, with weird red push buttons on it. The pool is ok, with a nice wet bar, but you have to request the pool towels at the front desk and they charge a $15+tax charge for deposit per towel, which are credited when you take them back to the hotel lobby, so do not get them too wet, because you will be dripping all the way back to the hotel lobby, otherwise, pay the $15 fee. The hotel does not have a gym. They also have a nice ambiance on Saturday nights with a nice local group. Since I went for a wedding, the ballroom, and the food in the wedding were excellent, as well as the service. Being a large group with different size budgets, other than the wedding night, we choose to eat outside the hotel, for a cheaper tab. Hotel is appropriate for families with kids, or a romantic getaway, as long as you stay out of the room.

As soon as we arrived we noticed the warmth and welcoming service of all the employees, during our whole stay every employee we walked by greeted us and smiled. Excelent service. The front desk staff is very accomodating and willing to answer all your questions and help all the way. Since we got a great deal ($99 dollars a night) with breakfast included and a $50 dollar credit in Food & Beverage, we stayed five days (mon - fri). We noticed that during weekdays there are less guests, so you have this great feeling of privacy, as if you had the place all to yourself. The hotel has a great Hindi - Tai decoration motif, you will see a lot of carved wood furniture, statues of Shiva, Kali and other Hindi staples. All so beautiful. It gives you a vibe of peace, very Zen. By all means pay extra for the ocean view rooms, it makes a great diference, rooms with ocean views are in the main building, floors 4 & 5. (We got room 521 (see the pictures), it had a fabulous view, even from the bed I could see the ocean. If you get a room on the side wings you will face the courtyard. The good thing is that since the hotel has a lay out of a \"U\" all the balconies look inwards so there is no parking view, or garbage deposit view, the worst view you could get is a huge palm tree right in front of the balcony. Rooms are clean and comfortable, this is not a luxury hotel, so you wont find much amenities in the room, there is no coffee maker,however ther is a mini fridge so you can buy snacks and keep them there, no mini bar, no internet in the rooms (there is Wi-Fi in the lobby but it reached my room in the main building, I'm not so sure about the rooms in the side wings). There is no pay per view, just regular basic cable, which is fine with me, who comes on vacation to watch TV ? Another thing is that they leave two extra bath towels for you to use at the pool, there is no pool stand so you have to take the ones they leave at the room and bring them back with you to either let them dry in the room or call to have them replaced.The room it self was in very good condition, housekeeping was very attentive with us, always left extra towels and soap, even friendly notes. Close to the resort (maybe two blocks away) there is an Econo supermarket where you can stock up on everything from beer to ant type of food and keep it in the mini fridge at the room. The food at the hotel is very good,a little less expensive than the food of hotels in the San Juan area. The portions are massive, the Cobb Salad is great and is big enough for 2 people so be careful when ordering, for example, we ordered a fajita trio dish which comes with a plate of tortillas and plate of grilled chiken, skirt steak and jumbo shrimp. My husband and I ate till we were stuffed and there was still enough for two more persons. And the dish just cost $11 dollars. *** Tip: 1- Take advantage of the \"Day's Special\" for $14.95, it includes soup of the day , house salad, and the entree thats on sale that day. 2- The Room Service Menu is the same as the restaurants, but they charge you gratuity plus a service charge for delivey, instead you can call the restaurant or the pool bar, order, and pick up yourself, so you get to save some good money.**** We had dinner one night in Deco, the signature restaurant of the resort, it was great, the service was awsome, we had a Seafood Asopao ( spicy soup) just perfect, and we tried the Pork medallions in passion fruit sauce, it was excelent. You gotta try the pecan cheesecake, heavenly!!!! On another night we did the \"Dinner under the Stars\", for $125 dollars, you gotta reserve ahead. It was sooo romantic, they set a table for you right in the beach,decorated with flowers and candles, very romantic music, and they prepare for you a very special three course dinner while you drink champagne or wine and see the sunset or gaze at the stars. We reserved after the sunset so we got to look at the stars and enjoy the full moon. A must do if you are on your honeymoon or aniversary!!! The beach area is very nice, there is jet ski rental for $55 dollars and Kayak rental for $11 dollars. In the afternoon you can sit at the beach and watch the most romantic sunsets, the pool is big but shallow, around 3 feet, 4 feet near the swim up bar. It was very clean and was open since 8 am. Since its summer there was a camp for kids, everyday they had surfing lessons in the pool for kids 6 to 10 and at the beach for older kids. There's a playground for kids right in the side garden.There is also a game room open 24hr. My husbsand and I dont have kids but we went a few times and had fun. On weekdays there is really no nightlife going on unless you have a car and go out, there is a movie theather 15 minutes away, several restaurants, bars and pubs also are close by. During the weekends the hotel has a wine bar that features live music, kareokee and salsa lessons. I dont understant other reviwers who take their time to complain about silly things,and spend their precious vacation time complaining about everything. why come to a hotel to look under the beds, under the sinks and swipe your fingers under every nook and cranny looking for something to complain about? Vacation is about fun, relaxation, about leaving it all behind . I will definetly recomend this place to everybody, It may not be as luxurious as the Caribe Hilton in San Juan but it sure beats them in value,quality and most of all in Guest Service.

On the positive side, the staff is friendly and helpful. The main desk people were nice and the housekeeping crew were outstanding. The room, and, in fact, the whole hotel were spotless. The pool was clean and nice, but only deep enough for a kiddie pool. The beach was great with plenty of chairs. Housekeeping provided a lot of fresh beach towels. The 5th floor oceanview room had a spectacular view of the sunset, and a good large balcony, however I had to fix a drainpire with a coke can so it wouldn't flood the balcony. The room was small with not enough surface space to put all the stuff that one spreads out for an 8 day stay. Only one side of the bed had a night table. The furniture was servicable but tired and certainly never high end. The linens were okay at best. The bathroom was all right, but again tired and the tile and fixtures were not what one would expect at a hotel as expensive as this. Both ice machines and one of the two elevators were broken and never fixed during our stay. You had to trek to the pool bar at the other end of the property to get ice. The bartenders at the pool bar were incredibly busy doing things other than serving the customers. I once tried to order a drink when there were only 4 people at the bar. The other three already had a drink. There were 4 servers behind the bar who were extraordinary at avoiding eye contact and not hearing your order. When one finally came up to take my order, she apologized and shrugged as to suggest that she was so busy. I looked behind me to see if 30 more people had snuck in, but no, the same four thirsty souls. Perhaps the worst was the fact that there was a wedding at the hotel and the wedding party had the rooms on both sides of us. They commenced to play loud music and talk and laugh loudly at 10 pm, cranked up the decibel level at midnight, and started screaming at 1 am, which they continued until two or three am for three consecutive nights. There was no response from the front desk when I asked that security be sent to at least talk to them. They said they would, but the noise continued unabated. In fact, I can't say that I ever saw a security guard at any time while I was there. Many guests had similar experiences as ours. One couple, who were on the 3rd floor, thought the screaming was a terrorist attack, and they were figuring out how to protect their children when the desk told them it was only a wedding group. There were rumors that the hotel was about to change hands, so maybe the management is just hanging on until something happens. All in all, I would have to say to keep away from this place especially at the prices they charge.

The beachfront area in front of this u-shaped hotel was small, but you had a lot of beach to walk on on either side. There were other small hotels to the left and a water sports rental place not far that had jetskis, banana boat rides, kayaks, etc. (but no sailboats). The beach was ordinary, with some waves and water more dark green, like the Atlantic. Rooms were ordinary, clean, of the Holiday Inn type of decor and size with a small balcony. The hotel has a sweet courtyard with a kids swings area and a garden with lots of hammocks and a couple of picnic tables for shady napping or reading - a nice touch. Good service at the front desk and by housekeeping. The gift shop was never open; nor was the wine bar in the lobby. Room service got most of our orders wrong. The room comes with free buffet breakfast, which was fine for free - the usual stuff, eggs, breakfast meats, greasy potatoes, some fruit, yogurt...but very good coffee. Not sure if I'd stay in the same place when I come back to Rincon. I'd probably want to stay in a funkier, smaller place near the surfing beaches or one of the paradors to get more local culture.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nantucket, Ma.

The hotel is well maintained, clean, with pleasant grounds, a nice large (albeit shallow)pool, nice poolside bar, and an excellent location on one of the best beaches in Rincon. It really is very nice. Oh, and the sunsets are to die for. The Bad. Get your reservation confirmation in writing as they are not above changing the deal prior to arrival. It took quite a bit of effort (even after booking in June for New Years) to get a written confirmation. The \"Beach Cabana\" rooms are not cabanas at all but simply ground floor rooms of the hotel. When we discovered this, we asked to be moved and were promptly found a room on the third floor. The views from the balconies are pretty much non-existent except for maybe 10 or 15 rooms at the very ocean end due to palm trees which have grown so tall and lush as to blot out any view. If you like palm fronds, you'll love it. The air conditioning units blow hot air right on to the balcony so there is no sitting on the balcony while the AC is running. By morning, the balcony is very warm, too warm to enjoy. Noisy. It seemed there was a wedding every night, and loud music was constantly blaring. At one point, there were two receptions going on at the same time and the resultant cacaphony at 10:30 pm was enough to rouse me to complain, twice. A real drag. The Ugly. The food service was abysmal. The breakfast buffet was fine, lunch extremely iffy, once you got it which was often 40 or more minutes. The dinners provided with the meal plan were really bad. Whatever you do, don't get a meal plan. There are a lot of really great places to eat in Rincon, enjoy them. The Bottom Line. If you are looking for a resort style hotel with a big pool and swim up bar, this is the only game in town. And the kids will love it! All the kids I saw were having a blast. Would I go back? Maybe, but only because I am armed with the knowledge I have now and wouldn't be so disappointed.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Des Moines, Iowa", "Title": "\u201cLaid Back Paradise\u201d", "Author": "jesslee1906", "ReviewID": "UR10860655", "Content": "I stayed at the Rincon of the Seas for my honeymoon and it was the trip of a lifetime. We were ecstatic to find our hotel after the 2 and a half hour drive from San Juan. When we first walked in we were struck by the grandeur of the open air lobby and the antique furnishings. Also, the front desk staff was very helpful. Our room was acceptable. The bed was comfortable and the balcony was a nice touch. The satellite TV was on the fritz so we didn't get many channels but we weren't in the room much anyway. The main restaurant was not open but the open air restaurant was very nice. I think we ate there 4 times during our stay and didn't get tired of the food. Rachel was our waitress and she happily answered all of our questions no matter how stupid they may have been. Also, we got the complimentary breakfast. The breakfast could have been warmer but I think if we had gotten there a little earlier it probably would have been. The pool bar was fantastic. Jose, the bartender, was very friendly and prompt with our drinks. (he makes a great martini by the way) The beach was lovely. There was a little erosion due to the recent tropical storm but that didn't stop us from enjoying it. We did some swimming and some sunning. But mostly we spent the evenings out there, watching the sunsets (which are AMAZING!!!), listening to waves and the coquis and drinking daiquiris. Also, the landscaping was great. Beautiful trees and beatiful flowers. We did spend one morning lounging in the hammocks. The hotel was great but I recommend that you don't spend all your time there. Get to know Rincon. Take the time to explore the crazy hills and winding roads. The beauty of this place will not disappoint. Also, everyone in this town is laid back and friendly. I recommend that you make the trek to the Americanized area of town and check out the surf and the surfers. The waves were HUGE when we were there. (Oh, and the lighthouse everyone talks about, \"El Faro\", it's not much to look at. The natural scenery and beauty outdoes it BY FAR!) As for the local establishments: We visited a restaurant called Angelo's for dinner one night. We got all dressed up and headed out, only to be quite disappointed when we pulled up. The restaurant didn't look like much from the outside. However, when we went in, our outlook changed. Flowers on every table, beautiful furnishings and Angelo himself was our waiter. Check out the Angelo's specialty. This place could not have been more welcoming and the food, well it just doesn't get any better than this. We visited Calypso for lunch. Great steak burritos. Again, a fabulous atmosphere and a wonderful view. The staff was welcoming and friendly. Also, be sure to visit the Tamboo Beside the Pointe. This is one of the most amazing bars I've ever been to. Again, it was the laid back atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff that made me want to come back again and again. The food's good too and the drinks are CHEAP compared to the hotel! It's a little hard to find but as they'll tell you in Rincon, every road goes to the same place. Keep driving and you'll find it!! We were there in the off-season so we didn't have many other tourists to contend with. I can't speak for the high season but as far as my experience goes, if you like seclusion, relaxtion and friendly people I would definitely recommend Rincon and the Rincon of the Seas.

The rooms are quite tired and dated, but since the hotel was so reasonably priced, and breakfast was included, we were not unhappy with our stay. The beach is lovely, as is the pool area, but the strap chairs are quite worn and need to be replaced. It was pretty quiet when we were there, which we were very happy about, but were told that it is the off season and it is much busier from November on.

While the accommodations are not luxurious by any means -- well-worn furniture, limited restaurant choices/menu, and spotty front-desk service -- we loved the super friendly staff, expansive (but shallow) pool, and beach front location. This was our first trip to Rincon but it won't be our last. All-in-all, Rincon by the Seas seemed to be above average for the area and was perfect for our group. The teenagers used the free wireless internet in the lobby and free wired internet in the rooms (bring your own Cat 5 jumper), our little guys had fun in the pool, playground and chasing the geckos, and everyone enjoyed the beach and breathtaking sunsets. We had a beach cabana, which was a regular room that opened onto the pool level. We paid a little extra, but really enjoyed being able to come and go into the pool level directly from our room (the patio door has a card reader lock) We found Rincon to be a wonderful area where visitors can see some of the old, traditional Puerto Rican lifestyle with some of the touristy items like good restaurants and bars, parasailing, and world-class beaches. Please note, however, that the emphasis in Rincon is surfing the big waves, not floating in calm waters. Swimming beaches few and far between and the water was more murky green than turquoise.

It has a beautiful entrance drive and respectable lobby. After that it goes downhill. It took us 30 mins to check in because they had lost the booking of the people ahead of us and our booking too. There was only one person working the desk and she was also handling all phone calls in and around the property. There were no bellmen around when we arrived but some surfaced after we got settled in the long check in line. I switched rooms after my first night but neither matched my booking. The first was a double and the second a king handicapped room. Both were satisfactory by motel standards but both had various damage such as scuff marks on the walls, pee soaked blanket, broken shower head, low water pressure, worn appliances, toilet seat won't stay up, loud noise from the hallway, shower at crotch level, shower doesn't drain well, super loud window A/C unit with the sound of marbles bouncing around, unmuffled noise from pool area and \"band\", service attitude that the guests are here for the staff, not the other way around. The guests here seem to be overwhelmingly from New York, of middle class, 50+ lbs overweight, families with kids. You _will_ hear screaming kids here. The pool area is fine with a sunken swim up bar. The beach is fine but steep, maybe 10 yards from beach head to water at low tide. There is free internet in the lobby and it can also be accessed from a few rooms close to the lobby. Otherwise you'll see many people camped in the lobby to check their email. I've avoided the restaurants and eaten away from the hotel. The local area is fairly run down and does not have many attractive places to go. At night there is a two person band with tape backup playing at the pool bar until around midnight.

I told him he could sleep for 5 days and that 's essentially what he did. I chose the hotel after looking at reviews on this site and speaking to a friend born in PR who returns on vacation annually. She recommended the Rincon area for its beaches without hesitation. My own criteria were: 1. Easy plane flight from the NYC area 2. Easy ground transportation to hotel from airport 3. Comfortable, clean hotel with good beach, good pool and good food and, finally 4. Reasonable prices. We flew Jet Blue from JFK to Aquagilla and a taxi delivered us to the hotel within 30 minutes of landing. No customs, no immigration, excellent roads, large modern taxi. The hotel was about 120 rooms, all facing towards the interior courtyard garden, restaurant and pool. We had a large suite with huge balcony on the 3rd floor facing the ocean on one side and the garden on the other. The price of the suite was the same as two rooms, but allowed us to both socialize comfortably with our son and maintain some degree of privacy. The rooms were clean, modern and tasteful. The bathroom was large, immaculately clean and had a separate room for the toilet facilities. There was a refrigerator and bar area. The gardens were lovely and lush. Our son was able to spend a good deal of time every day asleep in one of several hammocks in the gardens without getting sunburned. The pool was huge but shallow throughout (just over waist deep on my average female frame). There was more of a beach at the hotel than any of the surrounding properties and we were told that erosion had been significant over the past 30 years, virtually eliminating some of the beaches in the area. The sunsets were spectacular. Dining was acceptable but totally undistinguished. There was a simple but colorful local restaurant across the street. A grocery store was located within a 10 minute walk from the hotel and carried a full line of supplies, including liquor. The town beach, a longer walk but do-able, had kyak rentals. We didn't go to the surfing beaches, but Rincon is known for wonderful surfing and several people in the airport had their own boards. In summary, we got what we paid for, we relaxed, we spent a minimal amount of time travelling and we never had to deal with long government lines because we were in the US the whole time!
