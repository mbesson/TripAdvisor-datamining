I flew to Mexico City alone to go to a 2 week language school in Cuernavaca. I wanted to spend my first night in a hotel before moving on to stay with a family for two weeks. I felt I needed the extra time to adjust to being in Mexico and get oriented. I had never been to Mexico before. The Fiesta Inn Aeropuerto shuttle was a welcome sight, as I had heard that some taxis can be dangerous. When I arrived at the hotelat around 11 pm, staff helped me with my luggage. The mood in the lobby was exciting and festive; some sort of jazz was eminating from the hotel lounge, and there was much activity around. My room was quiet, clean and adequate; it was your typical American style hotel room. It had everything I needed to feel comfortable. The hotel restaurant has a buffet for all 3 meals. Yes, it is more expensive than eating from a street vendor, but it is very nice after a day of flying to be able to fill your plate yourself with a whole bunch of stuff, from salads and fruits, to Mexican specialities, to more familiar fare. I enjoyed my stay so much that I arranged to stay here my last night in country, in order to avoid stress the next morning on the way to the airport. I highly recommend this place and would stay here again, no problem!!!", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Idaho, USA!", "Title": "\u201cServed its purpose\u201d", "Author": "Bodeen72", "ReviewID": "UR7186867", "Content": "We booked this hotel to save $$ compared to the airport Hilton.

We were charged $180 USD with tax. The prices were outrageous for dinner in the hotel restaurant. It was empty for dinner as there is a Wings Restaurant around the block and it was packed. We were easy targets for someone coming in and stealing my jewellry case which contained costume jewels and some silver bought in Mexico. We arrived in the morning and left our bags unpacked as the taxi driver was waiting to take us out. We were gone for 6 hours and when we came back, my things were missing. Later that evening, we went out to dinner and when we returned, we found a catalog for porn available on the bed. This indicated to me that staff could come and go at will and the theft was an inside job. I did not report anything. It would have been a waste of time, I thought. Staff was distant and uncaring enough when we checked in. Mexico City was a friendly and safe city, but we were warned about unsafe neighborhoods. We did not have any problems, except this last incident. The airport area probably should be avoided, or take valuables with you when you go out or leave in hotel safe.", "Date": "January 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Whittier, California", "Title": "\u201cF Y I\u201d", "Author": "Miguel-Mex", "ReviewID": "UR3937436", "Content": "I forgot to mention that the PICTURES posted at the top DO NOT BELONG to the HOTEL AEROPUERTO.
