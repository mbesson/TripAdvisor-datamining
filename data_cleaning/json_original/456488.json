Literally minutes from the Spanish Steps, Via del Corso and Via dei Condotti. We had the 1st room just off reception, had no view and did have some early morning noise, but nothing major. We spent very little time in the hotel other than breakfast and sleeping but it was very clean and the staff were friendly. Breakfast was ok - very small area but fine, self serve- plenty of tea and coffee, scrambled eggs (never hot), frankfurters, bacon (I think!), pastries, cakes, yogurts and toast - it was more than adequate. En-suite was good, with great shower, hairdryer and shampoo sachets. Able to leave suitcases but only in reception - didnt feel unsafe though. The only downfall to our trip were the prices (paid 30 euros for 2 paninis and small beers in a not so good cafe) - it is very expensive at the moment, particularly for food and drink - a beer ranged from 6 euros (for a very small one) to 11 euros for a litre!!! Wine started at around 8 euros for a glass. Pastas and pizzas range from around 8 euros upwards, and meat dishes start from around 15 euros. Found a great sandwich bar on the main road just outside the hotel called IL Baretto (used by locals) - 2 excellent paninis for less than 5 euros. Also a supermarket (quite hidden) one of the side streets opposite the hotel for water (0.35 euros instead of 3 euros!), etc. Restaurants and and cafe's really do charge extortionate prices at the moment. Flew with Ryan Air and would definitely recommend the bus from the airport to Rome city (4 euros per person each way - excellent value). Be careful at the Vatican - it's not clear what you are queuing for - there is a main queue to get through security, but then it is free to enter the Basillica. If you want to climb to the top of the dome there is an extra charge (there are 330 steps (approx) to get to the 1st level in a very small winding staircase (with no turning back!), then a lift to the very top - but a brilliant view). To see the Sistene Chapel, you have to leave the main Vatican area and walk around the outside, then pay to go through the Vatican museum (amazing) - the Sistene Chapel is one of the very last rooms, but well worth it. Try emailing the hotels directly or looking online for the best price. DO NOT get caught out by the \"gladiators offering photographs\" at the Colloseum - they will charge you around 30 euros to be photographed with them, but there is no indication of this initially. Also wouldn't recommend paying extra for the video aid (mainly old1950's clips of old gladiator movies!)-not sure how different the audio was-if you want this, you can also buy your entry ticket at this desk and avoid queuing twice . Overall we had a brilliant time, fantastic city, weather was brilliant, hotel was great - only thing spoiling was the cost of sitting in fantastically located cafes and restaurants. But, would definitely do it again :)", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Netanya, HaMerkaz, Israel", "Title": "\u201cNice little Hotel in a Great location\u201d", "Author": "Danny K", "ReviewID": "UR125923860", "Content": "This Hotel's location is supreme, all the major sites are in a walking distance.

Our room was one floor above the reception desk and yes, the room was small but we expected that. After all, we had reserved just the basic double room. It was not a fancy room but it was nicely appointed and very clean. We thought the breakfast was very nice, just enough to get you moving and out the door. The gentlemen at the front desk were always very eager and helpful in giving us directions and restaurant suggestions. I am planning a trip to Rome next summer, this time with my husband, and hope to stay once again at the Hotel Forte.", "Date": "September 15, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beirut, Lebanon", "Title": "\u201cvery good ! recommend 100%\u201d", "Author": "rita n", "ReviewID": "UR117967053", "Content": "the location was amazing. staff was very kind. breakfast was a normal.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgood value and convenient\u201d", "Author": "789anonymous", "ReviewID": "UR117945180", "Content": "nice clean hotel, good breakfast, convenient location near piazza popolo on side street isolated at night so take care", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Haifa, Israel", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location and Staff!\u201d", "Author": "Elad K", "ReviewID": "UR117907942", "Content": "we took 4 nights at the hotel. the staff were polite, nice and very welcoming! the location is very good - that's why the hotel is not so chip.... the food in the morning is nice - delicious croissant and coffee the room was clean but very very small - take it into consideration.... very recommanded for those who wish to be close to everywhere...", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Location!!\u201d", "Author": "Natalie631", "ReviewID": "UR117764114", "Content": "My mother & I spent 4 nights at the Hotel Forte.

A little window opened onto a little \"courtyard\" but really faced another building so it gave some light and air and privacy. Great to have the extra room.

Cons: we asked our hotel to book reservations for the Vatican (4 euro) but they booked us for a private tour company instead (60 euro). \u00a0We weren't do upset because the tour was good, we skipped the 2-hour line, and a driver picked us up in the morning while a bus returned us to the hotel. We then asked them to call a taxi to take us to the airport when leaving. \u00a0Instead, we got a private driver in a Mercedes for 50 euro. \u00a0It is law for a taxi in Rome to not charge higher than 45 euro from airport to downtown. \u00a0Of course the private driver is exempt so we paid the extra 5 euro.

Breakfast is abundant but so so. My chief grievance is the way the hotel handled a serious mishap. Upon embarking on my flight on the following day, I realized that my passport was missing. After searching my handbag, it occurred to me that it might have remained with the hotel receptionist who had requested it when I arrived, along with my credit card. For some reason, he had returned my credit card but forgotten about the passport. I called and was told that a taxi would be sent to the airport to hand me the passport...but at my expense! I thought that was inelegant. The taxi would not arrive early enough for me to board the flight. I had to buy a new ticket and also a hotel room in transit because I had lost the last connecting flight to my destination. I showed my displeasure and the hotel reluctantly agreed to split the cost of the taxi. When the taxi arrived, however, I discovered a last pettiness - the additional surcharge for ordering the taxi, had been charged on me and not split. Too bad! i was about to adopt that hotal for my future trips.

There was one tiny window which was covered in heavy draperies, so the room was really dark. I was only there for one night, so it was okay, but it would've been uncomfortable for more than that.

Plus, it was convenient to shopping and the sights. There was also a nice little restaurant down the street which I liked.

We went to Hotel Forte's Web site, which is very easy to navigate, and found GREAT rates and decided to book our reservation.

We arrived around 10:30 a.m. and our room was not yet ready (this did not come as a surprise as check-in is not until later in the afternoon). They checked us in and were more than happy to hold our luggage while we explored Rome. The staff provided a great map, showed us where we were on the map and we were off! Once back at the hotel, we were taken to our room. The room was BEAUTIFUL and IMMACULATE! We had a great view of the little cobblestone side street. The shower and bathroom were spacious and again, very, very clean. Breakfast was excellent - a traditional European style with assorted meats, cheeses, breads and pasteries. Don't pass on the cappucino - it too was excellent! Other reviews cite various issues with noise at the hotel. We didn't experience any problems with noise and could not have asked for a better stay. Other reviews also indicate problems with cancelling/changing/altering reservations.

Most hotel room are on the small size, however Forte was quite roomy for the price. Second you need to consider location, safety, and budget. With the city of Rome you also need to understand most of your time is spent outside of the hotel and room. There is so much to see and do there! Hotel Forte's location is ideal for the \"walkers\" and those wanting a location near the subway. You are only about 1 block from the subway station at the Spanish steps. This is great if you plan on doing longer trips. If you are decent shape you can walk to everything in Old Rome. We walked to the Vatacan, Coloseum, Forum, Trevi Fountain, etc. We did take the subway and buses out to the Catacombs. For those into purchasing reasonable art on your trip make sure you are there during the weekend. They close Via Marguta (sp) which is the street which the hotel is on and all the local artist set out their stands and it is open to foot traffic only. We bought a great water color from a local that was fantasic. I also called the hotel direct and found a better rate than was posted on the internet. The hotel also arranged a car to pick us up at the airport. Very nice! They were standing with our names on a sign as we exited the arrival lounge at the airport. No stress or haggling with local taxi scammers! :) Enjoy your trip and see the city!

The mattress on the bed was a bit hard for us. We found the bathroom with tub spotlessly clean and modern. The room was serviced daily to our satisfaction. The noise problems at the hotel have been noted in other reviews. The street noise didn\u2019t bother us so much as that from the hotel activities particularly early in the morning.

We stayed in Rome before in 1996, at the Regno in the Via Del Corso, so we thought we knew the standard and area we were booking. The Via del Corso is more central but the Hotel Forte was adjacent to the Spanish steps and therefore close to the Metro. On balance I would opt for the location of the Regno, as there are not to many attractions North of the Hotel Forte, whereas the Regno was in the Middle of everything bar a trip to the Vatican.

In comparison with other three star hotels in Rome, this one is lacking. It is basically clean, but not spotlessly clean, which is something I would expect even at some two star hotels that I have been to in Italy. The mattress in my room was horrendously uncomfortable. Thank goodness for the feather bed which I slept on top of because I was seriously concerned that the spring might bust through the mattress. There was an unspoken battle with the maid concerning my only blanket. After my first night, it was taken away, rolled up into a ball and thrown atop the armoire. On my second night, it was in my armoire, on top of all of my clothing which had fallen off the hangers. Horrible. The in-room safe was barely big enough to hold a camera let alone my tiny little laptop (12\u201d). Besides the bad bed, the battle with the maid, and the tiny safe, there was the typical Italian hotel experience of having to place your key into a receptacle in order to have electricity. This I can understand as electricity is not cheap in Italy. Mine, however, loudly buzzed all night long, so I was forced to take it out of the wall. The next day, all of my electronic equipment was uncharged, and I had to fumble around in my dark room (yes, in day time because the window was so tiny) in order to turn on the light. There was also a smoke detector that flashed lights all night long that was right above the bed. Very distracting for this light sleeper. On that note, the walls are rather thin as well. In regards to service\u2026 On my first night, I had a bottle of water from the minibar. It was never replaced throughout the week even though I asked repeatedly. The breakfast attendant was fairly rude as she slapped down my hot drink order on the table spilling half of the hot water on the table. The breakfast itself is among the worst I have seen in all of Italy. There was no fresh fruit, and there was only a bit of curdled yoghurt, stale corn flakes and some slimy looking meat and boiled eggs that smelled a little strange. This was at the beginning of the breakfast service. The front desk staff, though, was polite, although I never really asked much of them besides checking me in, wake up calls, and for a taxi at checkout. My direct dial phone in my room never really worked, and I was never able to successfully dial out. People who called in to me were never able to get through to the room. So much for my business trip. There is wireless access though, which was nice. The location is great though. Via Marguta is a wonderful spot, so close to everything by foot or it is right between two metro stops on the A line if you are not a big walker.

Overall, this is a lovely hotel in a great location - would reccommend.", "Date": "October 12, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin", "Title": "\u201cDouble booked and unconcerned\u201d", "Author": "SCS", "ReviewID": "UR2521973", "Content": "We booked this hotel a month in advance after reading the great reviews, planning to stay for 4 nights. We arrrived at approx 9pm, to be told via the hotel intercom that we were not to go to the Forte reception as they had no rooms remaining -despite the fact that we had a confirmed booking. They had arranged a room in an adjoining hotel, who would accommodate us for one night and then we were to come back to forte. We went to the Forte reception to try and sort out the confusion and to provide our confirmed reservation. The receptionist was very offhand, telling us that it was common practice to overbook and that sometimes it's someone else who it happens to, and sometimes it's you who is unlucky! He then told us to go to the other hotel as there was nothing more he could do and he walked away!!! The room in the other hotel (the Manfredi) was tiny - in other hotels it would have been classified as a single rather than a double. However the staff there were very helpful and we asked if we could stay on rather than go back to the Forte. I've since read from reviews on other sites that others with confirmed bookings had been turned away. I'd therefore not recommend this hotel as you do not know where you'll end up staying!", "Date": "September 10, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Forte", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187791-d456488-Reviews-Hotel_Forte-Rome_Lazio.html", "Price": "$95 - $376*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Via Margutta, 61</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">00187</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Rome</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "456488", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/8e/12/ff/hotel-forte.jpg"}}
