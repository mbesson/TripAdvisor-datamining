{"Reviews": [{"Content": "First and Last Stay at the Etap I selected the Etap Hotel because of price since Berlin is expensive.This hotel has no lift, so I had to get a room on the ground floor asI am disabled, although ambulatory. The room was very small even for one person, although it had enough beds for 3 people. The lighting was so poor I had to go around the corner to the building materials store to buy a stick light in order to have enough light to clean andapply my contact lenses. The toilet and shower was modular, but the toilet was separate from the shower. The shower head was mounted in the ceiling and could not be adjusted. The bed was extremely hard anduncomfortable. The location was so far out that there were no restaurants in the area and I had to drive back into the city to finda restaurant. The best thing about this hotel was that it is clean, cheap and the management is friendly, helpful and speaks good English. I will never again stay at another Etap Hotel and would advise others to avoid it if you want even a minimum of comfort.", "Date": "Oct 13, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR820795457", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "RevImmgrant"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d735574-r10073933-Etap_Hotel_Berlin_Ost_Hoppegarten-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "735574", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
