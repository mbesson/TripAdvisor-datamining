Free wi-fi, which was great. My room was at the front, looking out over the Rue Legendre, but it wasn't at all noisy. The only drawback was that there weren't any tea-making facilities in the room, but I found a travel kettle for 9 euros in a hardware shop nearby, and a nice mug in a fairtrade craft shop down the road, so that was easily sorted (I didn't think to borrow a kettle like another reviewer...).

The bathroom was also very modern and fitted with a lovely shower. However, unfortunately on our last night of our 3 night stay, the hot water stopped working and the hotel was only left with freezing cold water. We could therefore not take a warm shower, which was necessary as we had been in the hot sun all day, and this continued through to the next morning. The staff were very apologetic regarding this and breakfast was offered to all the guests for free the following morning. This was unfortunate as sometimes these things can not be avoided but the staff were very good by keeping us updated and the free breakfast was good too. There were some nice restaurants and caf\u00e9's in the local area, including a great bakery just down the road and on a main square.

The rooms also have air conditioning, which is very handy when the weather is freezing cold outside. The bathroom was again spotlessly clean, with towels and shampoo/shower gel/soap provided.

On the negative side, they advertise with free WIFI, and that may be true, had it only worked. We never managed to connect. Once it connected, it was down the next second. The staff tried to fix it during our stay, but did not manage to do that. All in all, we will probably book this one again on our next Paris trip.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cVery modern and beautiful hotel\u201d", "Author": "BumbleBee10_10", "ReviewID": "UR78887627", "Content": "I loved this hotel. Myself and my boyfriend went in september and had nothing to complain about when we left. Were from Ireland and was our first time in Paris so didnt know the area but got used to the metro very quickly. Its 2 metro stops and a small walk. Area is brilliant. Theres shops and restuarants surrounding the hotel. The area was very safe. The rooms were exactly how the pictures on the website show. There is a flat screen tv in the room with a dvd player. Air conditioning was very handy. Shower was very powerful. The staff were very friendly and all spoke english. I would definitely recommend this hotel:)", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "D10", "Title": "\u201cGreat Hotel with Great staff\u201d", "Author": "x-y-z-d10", "ReviewID": "UR78213744", "Content": "I spent 3 nights at this hotel during its first week of opening. During this time I found all staff members to be both helpful and courteous in dealing with any request or query I had. Location wise the Hotel is in between 2 metro stops Brochant and La Fourche station on Metro line 13. I choose to use the La Fourche station as the Metro line splits in two here and you could choose the wrong branch line. The rooms were of a good size for a hotel in Paris, clean and with good air conditioning systems. The room had a nice colour scheme with solid and well built furniture. The finish in both the room and bathroom was of a high standard. Bathroom / Shower was clad in stone for the floor and walls with chunky/solid fixtures and fittings. Water pressure and temperature in the shower was very good. The rooms are fitted with a proximity keycard which needs to be left with reception when you are not in your room. I though this slightly odd, in other hotel I have been to in Paris they used an old fashioned key on a large keyring which had to be left at reception. With this new type of credit card sized electronic key I would assume you keep it with you when out and about. Just outside the hotel are 2 caf\u00e9 / bar establishments, both looked good and were open from early to late. I did not go in to them but they always had customers. I did not notice any noise from them in my room. They could be an option for a nightcap. The hotel offers breakfast at an additional cost, I did not take this option. As well as price another part of my reason to choose this hotel was the free WiFi which worked very well in my room and also in the lobby / reception area. As it was a new Hotel I had a small issue with the password on my first day but both ladies working in reception were very helpful in obtaining the correct password for me. During my stay the owner of the hotel was in the lobby while I was talking to reception. She introduced herself and asked my opinion of my stay. She was very eager to hear my opinion and was also excited to tell me about the hotel. Unfortunately I had just returned from spending the morning walking around the city and was hot and tired so I was not in the humour for talking at that time. I did not get the chance to see her again to give her more information. This is why I have taken the time to writ this review. Over all the Hotel is well designed and rooms are nice and comfortable. The two ladies on reception who I mostly saw during the day were very very helpful and friendly to deal with.", "Date": "September 4, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Art Hotel Batignolles", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187147-d1875252-Reviews-Art_Hotel_Batignolles-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "Price": "$116 - $321*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">110 rue Legendre</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">75017</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Paris</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">France</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1875252", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ce/86/62/chambre.jpg"}}
