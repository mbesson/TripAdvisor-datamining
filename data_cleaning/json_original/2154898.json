The decor is modern and classic, it is comfortable without being stuffy, and its immaculately clean. The entire staff will bend over backwards for you. The rooms are just right for being comfortable and cozy, you enter to a dressing area with closets and a dressing table which has the bathroom off to the right side and the bedroom directly in front. Each room has a private balcony with beautiful views from the higher floors (especially if you are facing the hills away from Pico). Upon entering the hotel you are greeted to a free bellini while the concierge shuffles your bags to your room. The bar is open and conversational, with additional indoor and outdoor seating areas to the side. The drink prices are high, but this is a 5-Star hotel in LA, so they are actually standard. The only con I can think of is that its a bit of a walk from the hip spots in LA, but there is a free shuttle service (in an Escalade) which we used frequently. And once you get your bearings, you can walk to several areas in about 10-15 minutes (including Rodeo Dr.). I never ate at the restaurant, but the entire hotel is simply fabulous. I dont think there is much better in LA or anywhere for that matter. I have turned my colleagues onto this hotel and they all love it too.

My 8-yr-old daughter and I arrived at 10am on March 10, and because of the excellent service we received the last time we were there, I knew there would be no problem with arriving at the hotel early and asking them to store our bags till check-in. I was correct. Upon arrival, we were greeted at our cab by wonderful members of the valet staff...the most fabulous I have ever encountered. They took our bags to storage while we enjoyed Bellinis (a virgin Bellini for my daughter!) at the lobby bar (where the bartender was very personable) and got checked in. So far, so good! Both times we have stayed at the hotel, I have been absolutely amazed by the service of the valet/bell staff. They remember guests' names, and by the end of the stay, they felt like friends. Because we are from North Carolina, we were partial to Brandon, who quickly introduced himself to us as another North Carolinian...making everything seem more familiar. We were waiting for friends to arrive later in the day, but I wanted to get some shopping done on Robertson before their arrival, so I asked if the house car would be able to take us there. Not only did Art, the very warm and friendly driver, take us to Robertson; he told us to call him when we were ready to return. We shopped our favorite places on Robertson and had a late lunch at Newsroom Cafe before calling Art , who promptly picked us up and didn't seem to mind at all when we asked him to make a quick stop at Sprinkles Cupcakes on Santa Monica Blvd before returning to the hotel. Not only did he take us, but he circled the block while we got our cupcakes! Now, THAT'S service! Let me now tell you some important info about location. This hotel is located at the intersection of Beverwil and Pico, which places it JUST outside the Beverly Hills city limits, but it is the perfect location for anyone who wants to explore the city. Walking to the shopping/restaurants of Beverly Hills is several blocks, but easy for anyone in relatively good health, and it's a beautiful stroll! For those who cannot do it, the hotel car is available most of the time to take you anywhere within a three mile radius of the hotel. If you need to go a greater distance, the valet/bell staff is always happy to help you with a cab. We found them to be very prompt. Also, if you need to rent a car for a day or two, I'm sure the hotel can help you. We wanted to take the kids to Disneyland one day, so we just called the Enterprise location on La Cienega, and they were able to pick us up before our rental and drop us back at the hotel afterward. I would like to add that we used the hotel car a lot during our stay, and both Art and Angel, the drivers, were most courteous and friendly. We truly felt like we had made new friends with them before we left the hotel! As for the rooms at the hotel, they are quite comfortable. Every room has a balcony or even two, and we found the beds and pillows to be quite comfortable. We had no problems with noise from other guests, and we were thrilled to find a newspaper at our door every morning. The room we stayed in had only a shower and no tub, but that was not an issue for us. I'm not the person who takes a bath in a hotel, anyway. The soaps/shampoos the hotel provided were good and plentiful, and the towels were good too. The hairdryer in the room is better quality than the one I have at home, and there is an iron/ironing board if you need it. The bar in the room is fully stocked, as well. No complaints at all. I also must commend the housekeeping staff, who did an excellent job of keeping our room clean and neat while we were there. With two 8-yr-olds in the room, it wasn't always easy to keep it straight, but every evening when we returned, we found everything had been returned to order! Because we were on the go during this trip, we were unable to enjoy a meal in the hotel's restaurant. We did order room service one morning, and it was prompt and delicious. If you are a coffee drinker, you will not be disappointed. Just as when we left the hotel last July, we were sorry to leave. Almost everything about our stay was perfect, and we could not have been more pleased. Thank you, Mr. C staff, for another wonderful stay. We look forward to returning and would like to commend the following people on their excellent service: Brandon (valet/bell staff), Emily (lobby bar), Ben (bartender), Joshua Garman (a friendly member of the staff) and especially Art and Angel, who helped us navigate the city!", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pasadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cAmazing and Fun!\u201d", "Author": "Jennifer L Posted by an Easytobook.com traveler", "ReviewID": "UR126283943", "Content": "Perfect hotel to lounge and relax in after a long wedding day!

The hotel is amazing in every way. It's like a bit of Europe in LA. These people DO know how to treat guests and run a beautiful and trendy hotel. The front desk is smart, helpful and professional, but at the same time, friendly. You are greeted in the valet area at your car and whisked away to the long, sleek marble bar in the lobby for a seat and a complimentary Bellini (this is a Cipriani hotel after all). While you sip, someone takes your credit card and checks you in. He then comes back to you (still sipping) with your room key. So relaxing and simple. The rooms are stunning. I was given a high-floor King with every amenity I could possibly need with a view that I am still talking about. On my small but big enough balcony I could see miles and miles into Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, Brentwood, Century City, and even to the Hollywood sign and Griffith Park and Observatory. Wow. The beds are fabulous. The sheets are crisp and luxurious. The decor was uncluttered and sleek - leather everywhere. Mirrors on every wall. No tubs, but huge showers with rain and hand-held heads. There was even a make-up vanity with a leather seat and mirror. Room Service was quick and they never got the order wrong (that's a first for most hotels) - in fact, twice they sent us (my college-aged kids were next door) extra nibbles. Nice. The lobby bar is handled by Emily, a true Southern Belle, who cannot do enough for anyone. The valets are a group of guys who greet you every single time they see you with a smile and a \"Welcome back to Mr. C. How was your afternoon?\" So polite. The concierge desk is manned by Kimberly, a beautiful and trendy British gal who knows just where everything is and is happening. She won't let you eat anywhere that isn't fabulous - she's got your back. The other concierge that I used was Solomon, a warm and smart gentleman who truly cares for his guests and treats them as if they were family in his home. When I had a problem with a restaurant, he told me that he wasn't going to send guests there anymore. He made me feel better about this restaurant and the shabby way that they treated my daughter, son and I. He then made sure that we enjoyed dessert in the lobby on him. Not necessary, but so thoughtful. There is a fitness center with many machines available 24/7. The magnificent rooftop is used only for private events, but any hotel guest can go up there to look around and enjoy the 360 degree breathtaking view. We only ate the restaurant food by the lovely, but small pool but it was excellent. Even the poolboys cannot do enough for you. When my daughter and son decided to move their chaises so to be in more direct sunlight, the poolboy insisted that they allow him to arrange the proper angle, new towels with headrests and a table between. Even my kids were impressed. The restaurant itself is beautiful. With a car, the location is great. Midway to everything. I would stay at this hotel again and again. No other hotel in LA could come close to the care, beauty, and professionalism of Mr. C.

I stay with friends more often than not but I've also used several of the \"go-to/must-stay/blah-blah\" hotels here (I won't be mentioning or dissing any of them.) I needed to come back to LA on business this month but decided to extend my stay for a little vacation time too. I'd heard about Mr C & was intrigued by it's locality - it's in Beverly Hills, so it's not surrounded by flashing neon & wide-eyed tourists gasping at their Star Maps - but it's close enough should you be unable to resist the temptation to drive past & point at a house where 'somebody' actually lives! Saying that, if the roles were reversed, I suspect Mr C would be the hotel that those 'somebodies' might drive past & point at. Because it is a GREAT hotel...the best I've stayed at in LA...it feels unique without trying too hard. There is a surprising (but most welcome) lack of pretence here - from the subtly grand entrance & the efficient valets waiting to greet you; to the bar & waiting staff; the reception staff & the exceptional concierge. I don't recall ever being in a hotel, where the bar greets you before the reception desk (or indeed hides it from view) - but on reflection, this seems to be the entire attitude of this hotel. It's like they know that they're cool & fancy, they know that we know that they're cool & fancy but they want you to know that it's cool to be cool about them being cool & fancy - because they think that you are cool & fancy for being there. You are just plain old 'welcome' here (e.g. - I found out that the space-age pool table in the lobby cost upwards of $50,000 but no-one scowls at you for playing on it...it looks like (& is) a work of art but \"it is a pool table, that is used to play pool on!\") The hotel has the feel of a members club, where no-one needs to check your card to let you in. It's friendly, it's cool, it's business & it's family. Oh & did I mention that the C stands for Cipriani? The food is good. The food is very very good. Mr C pizza is the one! If you come to LA often or if you've never been, I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. And I said I wouldn't diss any of the other hotels that I've stayed at here....so I'll veil my thoughts thinly...whatever you've heard, whatever you've been told, Mr C Beverly Hills, is 'More' Seasons.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood Service From Staff, Immaculately Clean\u201d", "Author": "Faz01", "ReviewID": "UR125052724", "Content": "We stayed at Mr. C in October 2011 for 3 nights. The room was exactly as it is on their website photos. Lovely room which was spacious and very clean, nice leather sofas etc. This hotel gives a personal touch service to its guests, for example the manager himself welcomed us and showed us up to our room and drinks offered on arrival. The Concierge staff gave us an excellent service, booked our restaurants, taxis, and universal studio tour etc. The bed is turned down for you and the newspaper is always delivered in a little cotton bag hung on the door. Very polite courteous staff. On the down side there are no tea and coffee facilities in the room. Food and drink are typical five star prices, we had breakfast in the restaurant for two people which cost just over $50 - I think it was $7 for a cup of coffee (small). In the morning the hotel do put out some complimentary coffee which you could go down and get to bring back to your room but we only found out about this on the last day. In terms of location this hotel is in a residential area and NOT near any tourist type of places if that is what you want to do - i.e. hollywood/sunset boulevard/universal studios/Downtown LA etc. Rodeo Drive is about 15/20 minute walk but the hotel really is located in a residential area - so be warned as taxi fares can start adding up - there is a house car which takes you within 3 miles of the hotel but this is not always available. We ate at STK in West Hollywood - food lovely, typical five star prices. We also had dinner at the Beverly Wilshire hotel and got a window seat looking onto Rodeo Drive. I was extremely disappointed with the food - I think they just re-heated the mash potato the food was very, very average and not of a high standard. We went to downtown LA and ate at the nickel diner - I had an avocado dish, it was delicious and soooooooo cheap. We didn't feel very safe in downtown LA probably because we have never been before and ventured down some dodgy blocks, needless to say we swiftly turned back. Also went to Universal Studios for the first time and thought it was brilliant.

This was an amazing value. The beds were incredibly comfortable, likened to Marriott bed quality. The decor was chic modern. The room had a flat screen TV and a small but beautiful bathroom with rain shower head and hand spray. Very beautifully designed. I will say that I found it odd that there was absolutely NO drawer space? Yes a closet but no drawer space. That would be my only criticism.

It is hard to separate the two as we pretty much spent our entire weekend at this wonderful facility. This is easily the best time we have all ever had in LA. Four of us gathered for a girls weekend of shopping and dining and I chose Mr. C due to the location and the photos on the website. From the moment we walked into the lobby we knew it was the right choice. The friendly and accommodating manager, Richard, greeted us and offered complimentary bellinis in their gorgeous airy lobby bar. While we sat and chatted, Richard handled our check in process. He returned with our keys and escorted us to our spacious, beautiful rooms - both with amazing balconies. We were having so much fun at the hotel we decided to give the restaurant a try. Again, the minute we walked in we were warmly greeted by the manager, Eric. He was the perfectly charming host for our evening. Our waiter, PJ, was helpful and proficient yet very personable. All of us continually commented that everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy working there. The food and service were amazing throughout. As gals, we like ordering appetizers and then will maybe split an entree or two. They accommodated us generously and without fuss. We ended up staying at our table for over three hours just having a great time catching up. When Eric noticed we hadn't ordered dessert, he treated us to delicious crepes - flamb\u00c3\u00a9ed tableside. Though we had reservations elsewhere the next night, we cancelled and chose to return to Mr. C's restaurant again. And the 2nd dinner was just as amazing as the 1st. Mind you, this was Grammy weekend and the Grammy host - LL Cool J - was also hosting a big party at the hotel. We had no reservations but they carved out a perfect table for us and treated us like royalty - even though the place was full of celebrities. Again service and our meal were perfection. This time, dessert was a piece of white cake - something I would never order - yet it was heavenly. Again, we pretty much parked ourselves at the table until closing. The next morning, we didn't want to leave so we headed to our favorite lobby bar where the adorable Ben made perfect cappuccinos and mimosas. Richard, the manager, checked on us throughout the weekend to make sure our every wish was accommodated. All of us agreed, they were. It really was a perfect weekend at Mr. C.

I selected Mr. C's at the recommendation of a friend, who is a regular n the Beverly Hills area. After looking a the past reviews and the hotel's website I decided to book a premium Beverly Hills view room on a high floor. Before arriving, I received an email from the hotel's concierge, offering assistance with airport transportation and other arrival details. I have to say that the concierges at Mr. C's are among the best I've ever interacted with. Not only are they very corteous and professional, but they are well connected, experienced and effective. They fond the perfect solutions every time, from renting a Fiat 500 to getting me on the guest list of a popular night spot. A big recognition to Solomon in the concierge desk! The valets and doormen are equally effective and very elegantly appointed in non-ostentatious but classic Barbour jackets. The hotel lobby takes you straight into the main bar, where I was treated to fantastic bellinis. So good that I went up to my room after 45 minutes of arriving! The bar and lobby scene is relaxed, refined and dressed up in an Italian/bauhaus design mix, with the friendliest bar servers that you can imagine. There is an outdoors terrace on the bar, which is perfect for an ever more intimate experience. The hotel's reception is cleverly hidden behind the bar, so that at no moment do yo feel in a hotel. I always felt as if arriving to a friend's apartment. Very cozy and welcoming! I used the hotel's gym several times and it is very well equipped with cardio and weights although it is on the smaller side and I could see it crowding up on peak seasons. The hotel's pool is next to the restaurant! which makes the entrance a bit intimidatng at lunch time, however, it is ver cutely arranged and I would really like to come back in the summer heat to dip in and enjoy more bellinis there. My room had a striking view to Beverly Hills and Hollywood. I slept with the drapes open as it was impossible not to fall in love with the sight. Very quiet day and night, although I can imagine that rooms facing the city side on West Pico Ave. must be noisier. The rooms are all very elegantly decorated in a matching blend of French riviera, sea-side villa and Italian country side. You experience wood, leather, pastels and rich fabrics. Very complete mini-bar (including intimacy and healing kits!), iPod compatible stereo, flat screen on-demand TV with movies and very fast and free wi-fi everywhere.

Truly, something else! from the proseco to the slow roasted chicken, I very much enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner at Mr. C.

We typically travel every month and usually stay in hotels like the Four Seasons and luxury boutique hotels. The opening of Mr. C Beverly Hills intrigued us and we therefore booked ourselves a weekend away. Check-in was quick and easy (with a complimentary \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcBellini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 in the bar) however, it took quite some time for the bell boy to bring up the luggage even though the hotel appeared to be not very busy. Several other guests spoke of a similar experience over the weekend. The rooms are decorated very nicely and come with complimentary Wi-Fi and bottled water. Our only concern was the noise level. We requested and were given one of the quieter rooms (facing the hills) which was quiet with respect to street noise. Design details of the hotel however resulted in the room being quite noisy. Rooms are fitted with hard wood floors that echo footsteps from above. It seemed to never end. We heard kids jumping and running around and the clicking of shoes throughout our stay. Voices, TV noise, and music reverberated through the walls. In addition, guest room doors are large and the sound of slamming doors can be heard up and down the hallways day and night. We ended up stuffing towels under our door (as the gap is quite large) but this did not insulate us from the almost constant noise. On the second night of our stay there was an engagement party in the 12th floor banquet room that had a DJ playing music until 3am. The music could be heard all the way down to our 9th floor room. Management were quick to apologize and ended up not charging us for one night and agreed to move us to a quieter room. The second room ended up being no quieter. By far the best part of our stay was the restaurant. Staff were friendly and attentive. Although we were usually the only couple having breakfast, the place was jammed at dinner. The food and service was fantastic but again the noise level was uncomfortably loud; more like a sports bar. Clearly the place is full of locals at night and on the weekend as everyone seemed to know each other. In the end it was a good stay, however next time we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be back at the Four Seasons or L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Ermitage. By the way, Mr. Jagger (the manager) and Mr. Cipriani (the owner) were in town and were around all weekend. Mr. Cipriani held court in the restaurant each evening. I mentioned to the front desk that we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to meet with either one to give them some feedback, as I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m on the Navigator Panel with Conde Nast Magazine, but they did not bother to connect with us.", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "westchester county, NY", "Title": "\u201cA lovely, quirky boutique with outstanding service\u201d", "Author": "tuckie", "ReviewID": "UR120613730", "Content": "It's rare that you stay at a hotel that you actually feel happy to come back to after a long day....but Mr. C fits the bill. It's mostly about the extraordinarily warm service, but it's also the small scale of the hotel. Excellent service comes in many forms. I usually stay at the Peninsula when I'm in LA and their service is certainly excellent as well, but it's different at Mr. C. At the Peninsula or the Four Seasons the service is discreet, professional, efficient....all of the superlatives you would expect but it can also be a bit cold and distant. Now don't get me wrong, I usually appreciate this....I'm not staying there to make friends....but at Mr. C it's quite different. The staff somehow makes you feel genuinely welcome and part of their small community without seeming artificial or obsequious. The small scale of the hotel adds to the feeling of intimacy. The public spaces and the rooms are quite small but are beautifully appointed and met all of my needs. The term boutique hotel is bandied about quite a bit nowadays but Mr. C really is a boutique....a small, bespoke gem that is a great contrast to the larger, more corporate hotels in LA. Mind you, that may not be for everybody. Many business travelers will complain about the lack of an in-room coffee maker and many leisure travelers will complain about the lack of a bathtub. And everyone will probably dislike the location....it's off the beaten path and is on a busy street.

The bar was in the process of closing and they even went out of their way to provide two complimentary drinks for my guest and me.

We ordered room service a few times (both during the day and on a late, late night) during my five night stay and the service was prompt and nicely laid out each time. The club sandwich is a must try. This had to be one of the few trips I've taken where I have had no complaints about where I was staying.

It wasn't the perfunctory, robotic service but one with warmth that made the hotel stand out. I was visiting LA to attend a wedding and opted not to rent a car so the complimentary car service (within 3 miles radius) was a key benefit. Drivers Francis and Angel were a big plus. Besides the good service, the room and particularly the bed was comfortable. There were enough electrical outlets for all the gadget recharging we needed to do. Wireless internet charges are inclusive (aka \"free\") in the rate - one of the reasons I opted to stay here. The location is good if you want to be in the Beverly Hills area - LA is so spread out that no one location is likely to meet all needs. My husband also liked the comfortable patio areas, especially off the lobby, where he could smoke his cigars. Regarding other comments about guests' dressing - it was only dressy in the evening/night and most guests were in shorts & t-shirts during the day. Concurring with other comments, however, the main drawback was the high cost of the meals in the hotel's restaurant. While the quality of the food (excellent pasta) and coffee (European standard) are high, we felt it did not deserve such a high premium. Breakfast, outside of the coffee, was disappointing. We walked to nearby eateries for breakfast and would recommend Urth Caffe, which is within a 10 minute walk.

It was an absolutely gorgeous room. We were entranced. I even jumped on the bed. Our bellman was great. He was very genuine and gracious as well. As well as very relatable and we had a good conversation with him. Following that, we went down to check out the pool. We were amazed with the pool. It was beautiful and the perfect size. The server by the pool came by for drinks, but we still had our bellini so we were set. :) After the pool, we went to check out the gym. OH MY GOD! The gym is beautiful. There was no one in there but us so it was like our own personal space. If you need water or ear phones they are provided. The equiment is very state of the art and the latest and greatest. After we were headed to get ready for the evening out in the beautiful restroom. We did not eat at the restaurant but headed for happy hour across the street at the sushi restaurant.

There are some hotels that just blow you away from start to finish, and this is one of them. I have stayed in so many hotels in so many cities, and I have stayed all over Los Angeles in different spots. This is by far my favorite. Every time we had a potential problem, they bent over backwards to fix it, and that is perhaps the strictest measure of quality and attention to detail. Decor: Impeccable. An interesting mix between modern and art-deco (just because of the lacquered wood in the lobby). The rooms are beautiful, which you can see in my photos. Crisp, clean, white. Cleanliness: Perhaps the best ever. I walked out this morning on my way to check out, and there was a maintenance man washing the walls and the door frames to eliminate those pesky dings that eventually detract from the ambiance. With respect to housekeeping, they actually gave us new, freshly washed robes every evening, rather than merely hang up the ones from the night before. Furthermore, this is one of the only hotels where they keep you practically overstocked on bath products at all times. Their products are good, and to make sure you have enough, you always have an extra set - one in the shower, one on the shelf by the sink. Finally, one day, I left my makeup in disarray, and the cleaning lady organized it meticulously on the dressing table, so much so that I took a picture. I think I'm going to explore implementing this system at home, too! Management: The manager who interacted with us was Jessica Fernandez. She was outstanding. When we complained because the room wasn't dark enough, she sent in engineers to cover the windows with film that made us completely comfortable. She checked on us for the rest of our stay, comping our breakfast for our inconvenience and even sending strawberries, champagne, and chocolates to our room for our anniversary. She and the concierge talked to us like we were old friends, and we actually felt at home in the lobby - a real first. The beds: Great. Lots of pillows. Crisp linens every day. The pool: Nice. Private. Perhaps a little small, but perfectly adequate. Value: Well, you really can't think about that so much in LA if you want a good hotel. Yes, I am sure there are hotels that people would claim represent a far greater value for the dollars spent, but I don't really know what they are. When I go on vacation or leave the comfortable crannies of my home, I want to stay somewhere that envelops me. This place does. It's expensive, but it feels good. Plus, it's much more reasonable than the Beverly Hills options that I won't mention by name here. Bar/Food prices: Well, if you raise an eyebrow at the hotel prices, you'll probably be alarmed by the food and drinks. However, I think they're pretty standard for 5-star LA hotels. Absurd. But, you're paying for the pampering. If that bugs you, go elsewhere for food and drinks. You're in the middle of an enormous city, so you shouldn't have any issues finding amazing meals and delicious cocktails. Overall, I can't really recommend this hotel enough. It's a showstopper with unparalleled service. And, it's convenient to everything without feeling like it's on a bad reality show or trying to create its own club scene.

The hotel had only re-opened (after major renovations and refurbishment) on 1st June 2011. The staff and service are second to none and definitely rivals any world class hotel I have I stay in around the world. The atmosphere, from the moment you pull up at the front, is welcoming and friendly. Nothing is too hard or too much for the staff and it is obvious they love their job and the hotel. I stayed on the 5th floor in a Deluxe City View room. I was fortunate to get a corner room with 2 balconies, one overlooking the gorgeous pool area, the other over-looking the city. The rooms are large and comfortable, with great amenities and layout. I don't think the room rates are high for this calibre of hotel. In fact, I would say the rates are quite low, compared to other 5 star hotels in the area and for what you get for your money. However, if you dine in the restaurant downstairs or order room service, or anything from bar or pool area, you will pay ridiculously high prices. A vodka/tonic by the pool cost me $24.95 but this was credited back to me when I complained about the price. There is no price list, so ask before you order. The restaurant menu and room service menu does have prices, but don't forget ... you have to tip also. There is a $4 surcharge for all room service orders, so bear that in mind, on top of what you order from the menu. Although the restaurant prices are high, after having breakfast and dinner in there a few times, the prices are on par with the quality of food, service and ambience. You will pay the same prices in any other restaurant in a 5 star hotel. I was blown away by this place. Everything about it oozes quality and luxury. I have read reviews that say the hotel and staff are obnoxious and pretentious. I would strongly disagree! If you want staff who are going to treat you like a backpacker, then go to a backpacker establishment. This is a world class hotel. The staff are trained to be friendly, courteous and obliging. I would say that some of the \"A list\" celebrity and affluent guests who stay and dine at the hotel are a little pretentious, but certainly not off-putting. This is what money buys ... luxury, fine wining and dining and an establishment that will spoil you. The only thing I had an issue with is the placement of the power points in the room. They are all tucked away behind items of large furniture. However, even this was quickly addressed with one of the staff members coming up to my room and plugging in a powerboard for me. This place is going to be near impossible to beat, for me anyway. Having stayed in more hotels than I can count, around most of the world, this will be THE hotel I stay in every time, whenever I am in Los Angeles. Whether you are on business or holiday or simply want to spoil someone for a night or 2, this place will not leave you disappointed. You will not want to leave.

When entering, the hotel lobby appears a mix of old-school NYC Yale/Yacht/21 club lounge [tho modernized a bit] + high-end-home dining room / library-esque - which in LA, seems off. Its almost too open/airy in terms of spacing to feel intimate enough to share a drink as a couple or small group. The decor is high end and 'nice' but over-thought, and while you want to imagine a vibrant bunch of beautiful, well-dressed people standing around sipping belinis - in reality it would be entirely awkward for such a scene to take place in a location like this because of the lay-out and decor. As an aside, the bartenders stand on a lower level behind an expansive bar when entering, which is also just the wrong amount of edgy - the sofas in the lobby too deep to comfortably sit. Hotel staff & loiterers alike were nearly all dressed just a little too-nice for a mid June vacation/afternoon - groups of men in 3 piece suits on the pool deck & women in little black dresses around brunch time on sunday. High end cars frequented the premier 'show-off' parking spots at various times of the day - a white bentley affixed on the grass by the entry fountain, several black maseratis strewn about other locations midday seemed more like props - even in \"kind-of Beverly Hills\"- than actual guests' vehicles. The hallways are carpeted w/ a plush velour maroon or blue (depending on your floor) w/ walls that accent said colors (pink/baby blue) - which is kind of just like \"huh?\" The rooms are decent, not that large or small - the views from floors 2-9 on both sides leave a lot to be desired - especially \"downtown facing\" given you largely overlook a large shopping complex w/ glowing lights from the ever popular Ross's grocer - the pool deck has no views as it is surrounded entirely by concrete walls and a few oddly placed, very tall palm trees. The pool is incredibly small & most of the comfortable sofa-chairs are situated underneath said tall concrete walls blocking the sun - leaving guests to choose from oddly shaped lounger chairs or those which are non-cushioned. If you're looking for a nice, spacious cabana - this also is not the pool for you. We much rather preferred the views, pool deck, seating & overall 'scene' at the Mondrian LA, for instance. The location isn't great - cabs anywhere are a must - or you find yourself wandering through residential stretches or questionable strip mall lined streets - the complementary car service is sort of a farce - 1 car, fist come first serve. Mini gripes mostly associated w/ new hotel growing pains - our room wasn't ready at 3pm check-in, wireless internet runs the speed of dial-up, no #'s on the telephones, simple computer paper printed menu, no mini-bar price list, & no specified hotel concierge are all side complaints. My friend and I are in our late twenty's and feel this hotel caters more to the 35-40+ married couple, retiree, or business trip clientele. And even at that, hopefully you dress well, have frothy high end taste, and don't mind wondering every now and again if perhaps you're at the wrong place and instead stopped by a scene out of Mad Men - this would be the hotel for you. It's not for lack of trying - rather trying too hard.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Los Angeles, California", "Title": "\u201ca day in heaven\u201d", "Author": "ericgh3", "ReviewID": "UR112821500", "Content": "First of all the pool was extraordinary and relaxing.
