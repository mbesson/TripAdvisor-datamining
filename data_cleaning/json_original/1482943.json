There is no breakfast room or restaurant in the hotel, but there is a nice lounge/conservatory where we went to sit and drink a bottle of wine in the evening, and there are plenty of places nearby where you can go for meals - we had breakfast a couple of times at Matamala, a block or so nearer the Placa Catalunya, where you can get a very nice coffee and croissant for \u20ac3. The hotel is extremely central, very close to the Catalunya metro station and a few minutes' walk from the Ramblas.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to come back!\u201d", "Author": "EmilyOhh", "ReviewID": "UR125524375", "Content": "My husband and I stayed her for the first half of our honeymoon and could not have been happier.

He even gave us a few hours to pay for our room when our debit card wasn't working overseas (had to find an ATM). The room went above our expectations!

We read a lot of reviews online that we shouldn't stay on Las Ramblas so we stayed here upon the recommendation of a friend. This hotel is in a perfect location! It's in an area called Catalunya which is full of shopping and restaurants. It is a 5 minute walk to the double decker city bus and touristic center to book other trips. It is less than 10 minutes from Las Ramblas and if you really feel up to it, you can even walk to La Barceloneta (the beach) which is probably about a 30 minute walk. The front desk staff is very nice and super helpful. Very knowledgable about touristy type questions as well. The hotel itself is very tiny and quaint. Typical European style. The good thing is, while in Barcelona, you will barely spend any time in the hotel. The room itself is super small but the bathroom is a very nice size. The hotel is very modern and clean. There is a courtyard area on the roof with lounge chairs that is really nice. There is no kitchen or bar on premises but food and drinks can be found right next door and all around the area. We spent 4 days there and one day we did the double decker bus tour which I would highly recommend to see all of Gaudi's work. We also did a day trip to Montserrat- just took the train out there which was super easy. The views were just gorgeous. We went to a flamenco show, visited the impressive W Hotel, ate some great food, got lost in Boqueria, hung out at the beach, partied with the locals and walked the entire city.

I would say good best describes it. So I visited Barcelona for three days in January and not sure where to stay. I found Praktik through Tripadvisor and it got good reviews so I thought I would check it out for myself. As soon as I booked my non refundable stay I saw a pop up advertising their sister hotel about five minutes away for about 30% less so that was a bummer. I still got a reduced price with Praktik Rambla (probably because it's winter season) and if you stay for three or more nights you get a free 10 ride metrocard. I booked a room with two twin beds for myself and guest but we were upgraded to a room with King bed. When we were told of the upgrade at the front desk I didn't understand that there was only one bed, I just thought the whole room was larger. Luckily I was with my mother so we didn't mind sharing the bed and when we got to the room we found it was just two twins put together to equal the king (did they not want to take the time to separate the beds?) so the room was probably about the same size as a double twin anyway. Some people might consider the room to be small but I thought it was very spacious for European standards. There was plenty of room to move around the bed and the bathroom was quite large. *Bonus* the bathroom has a good strong hairdryer! The decor of the room and bath was dark and sleek and the hotel had an overall Gothic look to it and it was pretty. There IS an elevator here and it does hold more than ONE person. Anyone who has been in a French elevator knows how small they can get. The front desk staff were friendly and guided us to various locations by map. There is free wifi although the signal can get a little weak on tablets I had no problem with my laptop. There is also free use of a computer near the lounge. There is no kitchen on site so if you order breakfast you actually take it at the restaurant right next door. My only annoyance during my stay was being woken up by my neighbor practicing guitar. We asked the front desk to take care of it and they did contact the room but the quiet only lasted a few minutes. We gave up and left the room. So just beware that the walls are thin. On a positive note,one of the best things about this hotel is the location. It is on Rambla de Catalunya which is full of restaurants and shops. You can spend the whole day just walking up and down this street. It is only two blocks from Placa Catalunya which is where the open top tour buses, 10 min walk to La Boqueria, and 2 min walk to Passeig de Gracia, so for tourists I recommend this hotel.

Amenities were not extensive, a soap, shampoo and bath gel but the quality was really good. The towels were really nice-smelling, better than in many hotels we've been to.

Many of the wonderful restaurants I found recommended on the internet is within walking distance from the hotel. The main shopping street La Ramblas is just 2 blocks down, as is Placa Catalunya, where the Aerobus stops. There's a small minimart just across the street to stock up drinking water (only 80 cents for 1.5 litres!).

We found the staff to be very helpful and we liked the fact that the checkout was at 12 - Barcelona is a great city for late nights and lie ins!

(for those familiar with the area, you are right in the block near the statue of El toro assegut or thinking bull) It is also a short walk from metro station with transport from airport. 2) VERY comfortable large bed (US king sized) with nice bedding 3) big comfortable shower with hot water and good water pressure (both rain shower and hand held) 4) pleasant, courteous staff- all of our requests were met with a cheerful \"no problem!\" As a bonus, the building is also lovely and has some character- they seemed to have done their best to carve a modern hotel with amenities while preserving the character of the building. I think that they could utilize their common area/terrace more than they do- they offered free juices there in the afternoon, but that wasn't too exciting and very few guests seem to utilize it. The terrace area is lovely, however. The wireless internet access was free, but was a bit wonky (signal came in and out)- overall was decent, but not something you could rely on if you really needed internet. They do have a small computer for guests to use if needed. There is also a small (free) in room safe which is very handy. We paid 151 Euro/night in July so not a bad price all things considered.

The room was about the size of a standard, budget hotel room in the U.S. The bed was large (U.S. \"king size\") and comfortable enough (if a tad bit firm) and there was just adequate space for hanging and storing clothes, suitcases, etc. Overall, we were quite pleased with our stay at Praktik Rambla and would recommend it to visitors that don't require the amenities. For example, if you get up early and want that first cup of coffeee right away, your best bet is to make the short (one-and-one-half block) hike to Starbucks for your morning Joe. The cafe next door (where you go for the inclusive breakfast, which we did not opt for) didn't open until after 9am while we were there.

We called reception to alert them to this and see if we could change room but were pretty much told that it didn't smell!! It really did, why would we lie!? The small window in the room did little to ventilate and the massive monolithic console in the middle of the room dominated the entire space needlessly and was impossible to find anything in due to the 'subtle' lighting.

It is just north of the most touristy area of Barcelona, which makes it very convenient but also not as chaotic/messy as the area south of it.

Location is perfect for a touristy visit to Barcelona. Walking distance of metro stations Passeig de Gracia (airport train) and next to Placa de Catalunya (airport bus). You are very close to all the hustle and bustle but far away not to suffer its negative effects (drunk tourists, massive tour groups). Rambla de Catalunya is a shopping street with good stores, but less busy than its neighbour Passeig de Gracia. We were a party of three so booked a double with extra bed. This hotel is spacious and easily accommodate such a request. Sadly the quality of the 3rd bed is crap and makes for a sleepless night. It is the one fault I have with this hotel. The hotel looks like a funky boutique hotel, yet is priced very reasonable, especially for its location. We had one of the very spacious rooms at the back of the hotel, overlooking the court yard with the massive green bathroom. You don't get a view of the street nor have a balcony but it does get you a really quiet room. Bed was large and very comfortable. AC was working perfectly. Digital flat screen TV had English language channels (rare in Spain for a ** hotel). Shower is wonderful too. Breakfast is not had in the hotel but in the bar/restaurant next to it. The free wifi reception in the room was a bit iffy, and at times only worked well near the door or in the hall way. But the hotel also has a free pc all guests can use, which is very handy for flight check-ins etc. Hotel also offer luggage storage, with a ticket for your luggage items as an extra safety check. Now, my big hang-up (as you can tell from my title) is their spare bed. You'd think a futon couch would be one mattress. Sadly not. It were separate pillows held together with unpadded fabric. Which meant that as the couch is not completely flat when unfolded you roll towards the middle, end up on the unpadded fabric and consequently onto the metal frame. Obviously, that means you don't sleep well. After our complaint staff did offer us another room straight away (the smaller regular double room with the balcony) but that too had a similar separate pillow mattress going. So we decided as everything else was great to suck it up and take turns sleeping on it. Seriously, hotel Pratik, go to IKEA, buy their cheapest futon, problem solved.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Yorkshire", "Title": "\u201cVERY GOOD HOTEL WOULD STAY AGAIN !!\u201d", "Author": "jsp55red", "ReviewID": "UR114767301", "Content": "This hotel was absolutley superb.

There was a restaurant next door and the hotel had an arrangement with them for breakfast. We were given vouchers for breakfast and on both mornings sat outside which was lovely. I was suprised to be offered english breakfast as in all other european cities we have visited it has been continental only so again this was a plus point. We had extra coffee one morning which we expected to pay for but they would not accept payment. The staff were also very friendly in the restaurant. The position of the hotel was excellent for getting around the city.

(We like to walk and don't consider it too far to walk 15-30 minutes or so to get somewhere...) And since Barcelona's public transport is so cheap and easy to use, we took buses for Park Guell and the metro for Montjuic, Barcelonetta and etc.. We spent our first night in Spain after long haul from Australia at this hotel and found it very comfortable - we had a front room with two small balconies and didn't mind the \"noise\" as some other reviewers have stated. I think if you aren't expecting a little street noise on one of the most major streets in Barcelona, you are choosing the wrong hotel. For me, that constant hum drum into the wee hours is part and parcel of being in Spain and living the life there! That said, when we left for Madrid at 630 am, there was not a soul on the street, bar a few taxi drivers, so it is a place where you can be right in the centre AND get a good night's sleep.

In a convenient location, I found this hotel quite impressive visually, given the price we had paid. Upon entering, it felt as though we'd found somewhere special at a budget price. It has a delicious ambiance created in part by the bare stone walls and patterned tiles in the reception area and corridors. The staff were very helpful, and whoever was on reception was always happy to make recommendations about local restaurants and bars, and give directions and maps. The building is lovely with the old and the modern combined well. Our room was a decent size, and came with a balcony overlooking the street. The bed was comfortable and of a large size. So what were the down sides? Let's start with breakfast. We'd paid for breakfast to be included. The hotel itself does not have a restaurant, but you are given a ticket to take to the tapas restaurant right next door, who then provide the breakfast. On the first day we decided to see what their take on an English breakfast was. First, we were brought a plate with two rashers of bacon forming a cross (Flag of St George maybe??), with two underfried eggs sat on top. Then, a kind of sandwich made from ciabatta and containing one thin, continental sausage. Oh, and orange juice and coffee. Not good. It seemed that they were trying too hard to be 'gourmet' about the whole thing. The next day, we decided to try the continental option. This consisted of a pastry (croissant or pain au chocolat), the same drinks as before, and a choice of a ham and cheese sandwich or an egg and potato omlette (which also came in a sandwich?). The continental was also supposed to come with a yoghurt, but we were told they had none left, and no alternative was offered. It's not a major gripe, but when you've paid extra for something, you expect it to be of a decent standard,and frankly I'd have been disappointed even if the breakfast was included in the room price. Another problem was the wi-fi, we had problems connecting all of the time during our stay, however there was a computer in the pleasant lounge area for public use. The hotel is close to Las Ramblas, a great place for tapas restaurants, bars, and La Boqueria market. Public transport including the metro is widely available from this area to other parts of the city. I'd certainly recommend the hotel to others, but I'd steer away from paying for the breakfast, just go out and find something from one of the local cafes etc. Oh, there's no minibar or fridge in the rooms, which I always find to be a minor drawback as I appreciate being able to store a couple of beers or soft drinks for in-room consumption. Despite the minor drawbacks, I liked the atmosphere so much I still have to give this place 4 stars, which is probably fair if I ignore the breakfast situation.

We were at the tail end of a European adventure and were keen for a quiet, comfortable hotel to use as a base to explore the food delights of Barcelona. Praktik Rambla certainly delivered that for us. We had an extra large room on the third floor, with a small balcony overlooking Rambla de Catalunya, with great views up and down the street, and although we had some of the noise from the busy street, the room had enough doors/shutters to block most of it out. We loved the comfy bed (possibly the largest bed I have ever slept in), and the big shower. We spent a lot of time in the room recovering from all the food and wine Barcelona had to offer, and we were glad of the amenities in the extra large room. The rest of the hotel was quite elegant, with an amazing internal space around the lift/staircase and a great little library/lounge area leading to an outdoor patio. We occasionally chilled out here with a travel book or drink pre/post-daily adventures. The hotel must have been quite empty when we were there, we didn't see too many other guests in these areas. The staff were consistently friendly and helpful, with a \"Hola!\" every time we walked past. We greatly appreciated our helpful welcome, complete with a local map and indication of the nearest landmarks (and a few questions about Australia). The front desk was also very accommodating when we needed to extend our stay by a night due to snow in London delaying our flight out of Barcelona, we were even able to stay in the same room. The only downside on the service was the maid/cleaning service, which was a bit erratic on which towels they replaced/didn't replace, and was sometimes finishing quite late in the afternoon when we were returning from our travels.

We just returned from 5 nights there and would have only enjoyed our stay more had there not been other inconsiderate hotel guests running down the hall upstairs from us at 2 a.m. Of course, their behaviour is not a reflection of the hotel by any means. Cons: I will start with the one negative first as the positives by far outweigh the negatives. The room did not seem to be cleaned very well. Two things that were quite apparent was the half used bottle of body wash left from (I assume) the last guest in our shower which stayed there the whole time. Second, as our room was small, a bag got kicked under the bed and when we pulled it out it was covered in dust bunnies and lint. Pros: The hotel is in a great location \u2013 close enough to everything, Pla\u00e7a Catalunya, La Rambla (but thankfully not on the actual Rambla), Casa Batll\u00f3, lovely restaurants, air port shuttle bus (cheaper than a taxi at 5.05 euros per person one way), etc. We did not have a room with a balcony so it was quite small but luckily we had small bags and the room was well laid out with shelves and hanging space so it was not a problem.

I actually wanted pay by cash. 2.They recommend a restaurant which was closed for the season ( they should have at least called and made sure it was open). We walked all the way to find it shut. 3. When I asked them info on some sights in BCN, they told me to walk down the road and find a tourist information desk. LOL. This hotel definitely needs a concierge. 4. On the first night when I wanted a quick info on the metro, the guy at the reception was engaged on a long telephonic conversation. I initially thought that he was attending to a query/guest.

Very quiet at night. 7 Euros gets you breakfast in the restaurant at the base of the hotel, owned by the same people. Breakfast was a bit too oily and undercooked so we started eating elsewhere.

Complaints: No English TV other than CNBC Money program and CNN - despite the fact we kept meeting English speaking guests. Our room (207) was really only a giant bed. They have a huge unit across the end of the bed (see photos) to form a giant cot. This unit takes up most of the floor space and blocks the room. It is a weird design. The unit forms the end of the bed and the TV is fixed on the back of this unit facing the bed. If you want to watch TV you have to be on the bed. In fact there really was nothing we could do in the room other than sit on the bed because there is only this giant unit and the bed in the room. There was about 2ft/30cm down either side of the bed to get in and out - the space is useless for anything else. The lights over the bed stick out on stalks and my wife cut her nose on it in the dark returning to bed, we found that we could push them to one side but it was very hard. No bed side tables but there is a ledge down the back. No clock. No chairs. No desk - nothing in room but the end of bed unit.

Walk through the entrance, through a stone \"tunnel\" into the center of this (6 story? can't remember exactly) townhouse and you find yourself in an open atrium that reaches up to the glass roof at the top of the building. A small reception desk, a central elevator, and a central staircase are on the ground floor. the effect is pretty cool You will be warmly greeted by Estaban or his associate who were both very helpful and courteous. On the first floor is a computer workstation with internet connection, but there is free wifi available as well. A wide open, sunny library with plenty of comfortable seating and a large table/workspace are also available. Outside the library is a sunny terrace with plenty of seating, chaise lounges, and tables/chairs for relaxing or getting some work done. The hotel is very simple, but very elegant. In a way it is really \"no frills\", but the design is really lovely. I had a single room as I was there on business. I won't lie...the room was tiny. The closet was not deep enough to hold a jacket on a hanger perpendicular to the pole..everything had to be on an angle. Not much room for storage, my garment bag went under the closet and I had to slip my suitcase under the bed. Now I knew why there was so much communal room to lounge in, lol....but, its better that way, why do you want to sit in your room? Again, room was very small, but very nicely done. Long narrow room with bed at one end, bathroom facilities at the other...simple stark white walls, white/black headboard and storage area, white linens. Tile floors. One glassed in cubicle for the toilette and sink. Another glass cubicle open to the room with shower. Shower had one of those great big overhead shower heads (nice) as well a hand shower. Bathroom area was done in a neat green glassy tile on the walls. Spotlessly clean. Did not get a chance to peek in at a double room or any higher rate rooms. Hotel is in a great location, with restaurants and shopping all around. The best place in Barcelona for tapas, Ciudad Condal, is on the corner across the street from the hotel. Little place next door is where you can get breakfast in the morning. Some rates have it included with the room, others don't. You get a voucher from the front desk. Honestly, i think it was a touch cheaper just do get coffee, a pastry, and maybe a little ham on a baguette on your own. Walk around the corner for a convenient subway stop. Walk a few blocks to reach the old town. Would absolutely go back to this hotel, particularly if on vacation. The negatives: 1) The high ceilings, central atrium, bare walls, and solid floors means sound carries. The doors are a bit heavy and everyone on my floor seemed not to get the concept of not letting them slam. It wasn't crazy as the hotel is generally quiet as people spend their day and evenings out on the streets, so I guess a minor negative...I just got startled a few times when trying to doze off, lol. 2) Tiny room means a tiny bathroom. I can picture someone with a complicated morning routine crying in frustration. I know my GF would have gone nuts trying to get ready in there in the am. No counter space...there are no counters. Small sink is wedged in the corner up against the wall and I couldn't even stand over it to brush my teeth 3) If you are there on business, don't expect to get any work done in your room. There are no work surfaces. This was a drawback for me. I was there over the weekend, so I took time for sightseeing, but I had to get work done, too. So, you had to go out to the library to do it....some of my work is sensitive and I don't like being out like that. Again, i had a small single room, so I can't say that its that way in the doubles, but I get the feeling it is as I hear someone from a double complaining that there were no chairs in the room. Its not a business hotel, its a vacation spot. the only other negative I can say is not a negative about the hotel itself, but about Barcelona in general. WATCH YOUR BELONGINGS LIKE A HAWK...the city is full of pickpockets and thieves. I know too many people that have lost stuff on the streets. A couple had their backpack stolen righ in the lobby of the hotel while I was checking in. Let me stress that this is not the fault of the hotel or staff...just a fact. I was targeted by a woman who saw me fumbling with my bags getting out of a taxi (I was on a 2 week trip and had a garment bag, small roller, and computer bag)...she followed me in pretending to read a tourist map, hoping that I would get distracted and she could steal my computer bag. By training, i dumped all my stuff in front of me agains the reception desk. When she saw she couldn't get my stuff, she sidled over to a lone bag that the other couple had left unattended by the door, picked it up and casually walked out the door, all the time reading her map. None of us realized what had happened for another minute or so, when the couple realized that their bag was gone. The receptionist was occupied speaking to the couple and his view of their bag was obstructed by his computer monitor. He was absolutely mortified that it happened and ran out the door trying to find the woman. No luck.

Noisy, yes, but not a problem for us. food options in the area weren't as good as in El Born (where we stayed the first 3 nights in Barcelona) and was pricey, which was a downside. Definitely more upscale, older clientele as well (compared to the Born), but I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again for the atmosphere of the hotel itself! wonderful outdoor patio as well, with showers, but no pool? kinda odd...", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Gothic Boutique Hotel\u201d", "Author": "OliAtkinson", "ReviewID": "UR82169004", "Content": "My girlfriend and I recently had a very enjoyable stay at Hotel Praktik Rambla.

We upgraded to a Praktik WOW! room, which meant we had a good-sized room overlooking the relaxing sun-terrace. The room itself was beautiful, with high ceilings and big windows. The walk in shower was another good feature. The best feature of the hotel was the relaxing sun terrace. It was a lovely place to spend the morning, soaking up the sun, enjoying a coffee and listening to the relaxing background music.

Thankfully, my son and husband let me out when I was done showering! They also had internet available on a computer in a shared area which was handy.. The staff really stood out for us. We had flight trouble, arrived 6 hours late at about 6:oo pm and didn't get 2 of our 3 bags (the one we did get was broken and wrapped in plastic). They suggested where we could look for a replacement bag, took our lost luggage information and followed up with the airline and delivery service regularly. This was a huge relief as we'd been traveling for over 24 hours. We went and bought a new bag, had dinner and hit the sack. We still didn't have all our bags when we checked out the next day so left what we had with the hotel and went to see Barcelona. When we returned about 4:00, we were happy to find that the rest of our luggage had been delivered so we proceeded to the ship for the rest of our trip!

We are a family of 7, booked two rooms prior to our 10 day Disney Cruise. Entrance: Very charming and has a ramp, so not a problem at all for wheelchairs. Location: Close to Plaza Catalunya (5-10min walk), but not in busy, nosiy area like off La Rambla. Many great restaurants right out the door, don't miss Ciudad Capital for excellent tapas. Rooms: My husband and two small children (age 1 and 4) fit comfortably in a standard room with a king size bed and small couch. Room was small, but clean and bed was comfortable. The rain shower is amazing, they provide hair dryers in every bathroom. We also had wonderful view from our balcony. Airconditioners worked fine in every room. My parents and younger sister stayed in a handicap room which was HUGE (even for american standards)! There was a roll-in shower and the toilet was an appropriate height for my father's rolling shower/toilet chair, the large bathroom was very easy to maneuver around. In addition,they provided an extra full size bed for my sister. No problems at all for my father who is completely wheelchair bound, plenty of space...probably triple the size of a standard room. The Lift is small, but still not a problem for my father. Decor: Primarily black and white, modern and elegantly simple. Cons: the hotel lobby is tiny, but that can be a good thing...no lines. There is no bell hop (but the staff were very helpful in assisting us with our bags...tons with small kids and one handicap traveller), and no ice machine, which is sometimes useful in hot weather.

As soon as you open the door you have to side step to get in b/c the edge of the bed is there. However, we did receive housekeeping every day and the room was clean and well kept.

We did not eat breakfast at the hotel so I cannot speak to that. Breakfast doesnt seem to be a big deal in Barcelona but if you want something hot u can go next door to Piso labis I think its called (red awnings on the tables) and they make fried eggs and toast or Happy Bar and Grill a couple blocks away has a simple hot breakfast. You also get a 10% discount at some of the surrounding tapas restaurants. When they give you the room keys its held in a card that states on there which ones. Try Sangria de Cava if the restaurants have it. very refreshing.

We have been lucky enough to travel with both high end and budget accommodations. From Santorini to Prague to Rio, we've seen a lot of nice hotels, but this one really stood out. Location: Superb! The hotel is located just off the main drag of La Rambla enough to escape the madness but still so close you can feel the action. There is a metro stop just a short 2-3 minute walk away that will take you to the beach or any other destination easily. The street outside is a bit more classy than La Rambla and is full of many different types of restaurants and other hotels. Below our balcony, the center walkway between the smaller streets was sprinkled with cute, outdoor seating for nearby restaurants. It was a quiet area but you can also open the balcony door and hear the enchanting sounds of the city, including the faint sound of clinking glassware and hushed chatter, if you so wish. Aesthetic: Trendy, cozy, modern yet classic. We loved the d\u00e9cor in our room and around the hotel. Our room was black and white with bold furniture pieces with unique shapes, a plush king size bed, couch for lounging and flat screen television. The bathroom is dark green tile, enclosed by walls that are all mirror on the outside. Its makes the room feel much larger and creates an effect that can be quite fun. The bathroom showerheads are also worth mentioning. It is directly overhead and wonderful! There is also an additional, removable showerhead as well. The common area of the hotel includes a large study with masculine table and a large patio on the second level with swanky furniture. From the patio, you can see the tops of buildings that surround the area and highlight the beautiful architecture of Barcelona. Furthermore, there is an internet spot which provides free internet access on the hotel's computer. Staff: The staff was very helpful and eager to answer all of our questions. We were even surprised upon our arrival to learn that they had upgraded us from a standard room to a superior room that faced the main street below. Remarks: For its price, this hotel exceeded all our expectations. To be in a the heart of the action but yet still away from it all is the perfect balance.

There isn't much to look at outside but the floor-to-ceiling windows in the bathroom were still dramatic. The walk-in rain showers were excellent! The beds were comfortable with the exception of my sister's roll-away. The size of the rooms were a little on the small size, but who comes to Barcelona to sit in their hotel room? We had enough space to be comfortable and unpack our things. There are plenty of places to sit and people watch just steps from the front door of the Praktik. At many of the restaurants you have the choice of sitting inside or at the outdoor tables in the middle of the boulevard. The hotel is just a few blocks north of Placa Catalunya. This is a great access point to all areas of Barcelona via the HoHo buses. Upon check-out we were able to leave our bags until early afternoon.

It is very close to La Rambla, shopping, and the metro but not very noisy. The cheaper rooms are extremely small with no closet or room for suitcases etc. The beds however are very comfortable and clean. The back of the hotel faces adjacent buildings which proved to be a problem for us and some other unlucky guests when the neighbor building started farnishing their floors and then leaving their windows open. We slept one night with toxic fumes in our room. We used our sheets to protect us from the fumes. The hotel was full and couldn't move us anywhere so they said. This was very upsetting and felt like because we were in the cheaper rooms, we had no recourse. They were not very accommodating to us. I thought about moving to the first floor indoor outdoor lounge which is spacious and comfortable and probably should have. As an aside there is also one computer with internet access on this floor. The manager moved us to a large room on the 3rd floor with views facing out on the third day for one night only to make up for our inconvenience. He offered to have us stay the last night there if we paid the upgrade. I decided to not pay the upgrade fee for the next night and then changed my mind when I saw the space. These rooms cost more to upgrade to but are really worth it. They are huge in comparison to the inside double rooms. When I went back down to say we definitely would stay in the big room and pay the difference, they said we couldn't. We stayed another night in a smaller room without smell because they needed the large room for someone else. We were upset to have to move 3 times during our 4 day stay but Ruben was very helpful to us. Thanks. If we had not had the problem with the fumes, we would have enjoyed our stay there even though the room was so small. If you go, make sure to pay more and stay in the front rooms.

Our relevant experiences: free wifi that worked flawlessly, uniformly friendly and helpful staff, a stylish, quiet and peaceful room despite being on the busy street, an amazing location close to the action but away from the fray, and a clean, comfortable, affordable home base from which to explore the city. We had no need for a pool, room service, an ice machine, a gym or a restaurant and did not miss them. Our room was lovely - compact, but with strategically placed mirrors and clever furnishings that maximize space. Two small balconies were a real treat from which to observe street life. Each balcony had 4 ways to shut out the street - double glass french doors and three \"pocket door\" shutter/glass choices to close out noise and/or light - an additional set of glass doors, a set of louvered doors and a set of closed panel doors. Close them all and it's as dark and quiet as a tomb. The beds are great. The temperatures were in the 90's during our stay and the AC was adequate but we're from Miami and used to the heat. The cupboards and safe are black inside, so check carefully to be sure you don't leave anything behind. The green bathroom tiles are elegant but dark compared to the beautiful light in the room. The shower is exceptional. To answer a previous concern about triple room bathrooms - our bathroom door was mirrored on the outside but a closed panel on the inside. Very roomy and totally private. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel (alas, I could not manage to win a free breakfast by guessing the correct soccer scores). We enjoyed the healthy and inexpensive takeout breakfasts and lunches at Nostrum across the street. Tapas were almost always a hit, as were fruit cups and smoothies from the market if you shop carefully for freshness. Our only disappointing food experience in Barcelona was paella in Barceloneta - a much less delicate version than we are accustomed to. We loved the location. An easy walk to Las Ramblas and other tourist destinations, the Airport Bus in Placa Cataluna, and several metro stops. The street has some foot traffic during the day, but was often closed to cars. This hotel is a winner if you are looking for a stylish, comfortable, friendly and affordable hotel from which to explore the city. It is particularly attractive if you need a triple room and have no need for room service, pool, spa, etc. Don't be afraid of the street side - it's lively and exciting, but can be totally quiet at night if you choose.

Hotel Praktik Rambla delivered on all three counts. Pro's: 1. Location: At the \"top\" of the Ramblas, Barcelona's touristy but fun walking avenue, the Praktik is well located. In fact by being 2 blocks up from Placa Catalunya, this means that you are just removed enough from the insanity of the Ramblas, but really by only 5-10 minutes walk. Restaurants abound (although we have yet to find decent, regular food in Spain after 1/2 dozen visits, more below), cafes are everywhere (Starbucks a block away - sorry it had been 5 weeks!) and parking is alright too (20 euros by special arrangement with the hotel). Driving in from the highway was a breeze. Placa Catalunya's proximity means that the excellent and sometimes air conditioned metro is right there too. 2. Room. First thing to mention is that getting a room with a third bed in Barcelona was very difficult. But this place does it, in a very large and comfortable room (room 410). Now if modern makes you cringe, don't think about this place. This is old building completely \"funkified\" - old wood stripped bare and juxtaposed with crazy colours. Gaudi left his mark on Barcelona and since then its citizens have had license to get away with anything. But it works very well, IMHO - as a modern design fan. Some more below on the room. 2. Service. This was a mixed bag that ended well, so it is a pro for me. First, the receptionist on arrival was quite a \"business-like\" person - formal almost school-teacher-like - lighten up and join the customer service world! A request for a good venue to watch a world cup game was met with: \"just go out into the street, there are lots of restaurants to choose from\". Thanks for the advice, that thought never came to me... The next few problems were resolved by the receptionist we had in the morning. She was a delight to deal with, giving us advice of all sorts and even booking a restaurant for us. THAT was service. The 3 complaints we had with the room: 1. The \"rain' shower was completely plugged with calcium deposits and was shooting painfully out of the remaining few unplugged holes. Upon our return this was sorted out. 2. The aircon was a bit lame. I think they fixed it a bit, but it never did work fully. But we were comfortable enough. It was very hot outside 3. Finally, the morning room cleaners made an absolute racket going in and out of their storage room down the hall and slamming the door each time. It did not recur the next morning (after we complained. Con's: 1. Service: See above complaint about receptionist. Also, they have this empty patio on the first floor that has this modern, BRIGHT light. As we overlooked it, it was quite bright well past midnight (with nobody ever there) in the room. Tone it down about 10,000 lumens and save the environment in the process! 2. WiFi: They have free wifi, but it could not reach our room! That's not very useful. In this day and age, people are not using it just to send emails, but they use it to plan their trip, reserve restaurants, book trips, checkin. Given the low cost of a wifi setup, free and well-functioning wifi is as essential as a good toilet. Hints: 1. Starbucks: A block down for those who need their \"home\" fix. 2. Food: Bring your own food to Spain. Of course this is in jest, but there doesn't seem to be anything in the mid-price world that is not Italian. And it is really, really bad Italian, worse than the Olive Garden chain (never thought that was possible). And tapas just don't appeal to me. I have no expectations for reasonably-priced, good food anymore. The \"El Raco\" next to the Praktik is awful - run away unless you hate yourself. \"Happy Grill\" dpwn a block was not much better. \"Pans & Company\" was ok for a sandwich and coffee. But frankly, prison food is probably better. Next time, go to the French border and do take-out... 3. FC Barca: Do the visit of Camp Nou - excellent, excellent with the new interactive setup. 4. Servicaixa: Book your event tix online and pick them up at the bank machine at the Caixa (bank) outlets. Wow, nice to have competition to Ticketmaster!

It was a old hotel with lots of character yet the room was very clean, recently renovated and up to date, and the bathroom was very, very nice; updated and very clean. The location was great on Las Ramblas and we were very comfortable in walking around the area, and enjoyed a wonderful Tapas and Sangria dinner at the outdoor cafe just next door to the hotel. The hotel staff spoke English and were very helpful with our questions and provided great recommendations, including a double decker bus tour of the city (taken from a spot just a few blocks from the hotel). The tour was very informative and a great way to see lots of Barcelona in a short period of time. I wish the hotel served a light breakfast or coffee in the morning, but there is a nice local bakery just a 1/2 block from the hotel. Also, we had a room that faced the Las Ramblas street and it was a bit noisy during the night as residents like to eat late and enjoy a beautiful evening out.

We took our own travel kettle as there arent any provided, I prefer to eat and drink before going out in the mornings, we bought some fruit from the market .

The outside seating area was lovely although we did not have time to try it out, there were plenty of tables and chairs. We stayed from Monday to Friday and our towels were only changed once, I did request clean ones as they were too wet to use, unfortunately they arrived after 12am when we were in bed, needless to say we did not answer the door, so did not get our towels changed. The good points are the hotel is in acentral position, is an amazing building with original features. There is a good tapas restaurant next to the hotel but do not go to Italian to the right of hotel exit as we found it to be very poor.

Check in is actually a lovely experience! (where in any hotel it would be a dull or annoying moment, in this hotel it's nice and easy). The hotel is situated on Las Ramblas the most beautiful boulevard in Barcelona. Please note that the location is not Ramblas Catalunya where the crazy partying goes on in the city; Las Ramblas, the one of the hotel, is a charming and rather quiet street in the center of Barcelona, just one block away from the famous Passeig de Gracia with plenty of restaurants and exclusive boutique shops (Casa Batllo, a famous Gaudi masterpiece is at a 8 minutes walk from the hotel). There is a metro station half a block away. If you need a taxi, don't worry there are several cabs parked across the street from the hotel. On site there is one of the fines tapas restaurants of Barcelona, called Piscolabis, where breakfast is served every morning at an aceptable rate. There are several tapas restaurants and a pizzeria (pizza place) a stone throw away. We had a superior room which was spacious and well fitted and a double room which was rather small, yet cozy and comfortable . I would suggest you request a superior room, for just a small extra amount it is quite convenient. The building of the hotel is the admired La Casa Climent Arola, a beautiful design by the renowned catalan arquitect Francesc Villar. The facade is precious, the entrance is magestic and the lobby, although small, is very special. There is a lounge on the first floor with books and a nice decor with a door that connects to a lovely terrace with a shower and vending machines hidden behind a white curtain. There is a computer for everyone to use on the first floor with free Internet. There is wi fi free Internet throughout the hotel. There is nothing to complaint about the hotel.

The entrance to the hotel and the design in and around it is great and modern but with a rustic feel. The staff (and I think we met about 3 different front-desk-clerks) was all amazingly friendly, always cheerful and happy to help and were fun to joke with (I prefer fun staff instead of purely professional staff, these were both). And should they be busy with another guest, sit like a king in the \"Princess chairs\" in the lobby while you wait. I read all the other reviews (for this and the top #30 hotels in Barcelona) before deciding on this one, and as I've now been there, I can say they are nearly all spot on. Those who got unlucky with some aspect of the hotel staff or cleaning, probably got just that, unlucky, happens at any hotel. I saw some less-than-accommodating guests who gave the staff a hard time over literally nothing (directions to a Museum for example), and they treated that person like a king regardless. That's good service - and it always came with a smile. The room was surprisingly small (not much space beyond the bed) but tastefully decorated with bold but neutral colors and (very) high ceilings (they should almost make some pully-system for hoisting up your suitcase into the air). The bathroom was in contrast very big, and decorated with funky green tile and the shower-head is the biggest I have ever seen, you'll love it! The only drawback to the room was that it felt slightly cramped at times and there was no good place to put your suitcase, and clothing storage was also scarce. That said, after the initial \"surprise\", we made it work just fine and thought no more of it. There's also an in-room safe that's quite large (although beyond a 15\" laptop you won't fit it). The room got cleaned to perfection every day, and the \"Spa products\" (shampoo etc) are truly top notch, I think every guest \"steals\" a few of those. If you plan on spending lots of time in your room, this is not your hotel, and probably not your city either for that matter, for any other type of trip, this is a brilliant hotel. The beds are very comfortable and the pillows are great (this goes a long way in my book), and in our case the room (number 311) was quiet and we slept with the windows open (there is an A/C as well if needed, in April the nights are still slightly chilly). The back patio of the hotel (first floor) is wonderful, with loads of comfortable lounge chairs and sofas and is very secluded. There's no pool, but if you're in Barcelona for that kind of activity, just go to the beach instead. Instead, buy some Cava (Spanish Champagne) and some Chorizo (spicy sausage) and take a siesta on the deck, that's what we did. The restaurant next door serves as the \"hotel restaurant\", but in Barcelona you really don't need a restaurant in the hotel, there's food to be had literally everywhere. That said, the restaurant next door serves excellent food, their egg-based breakfast tapas are amazing, try one. All in all, we loved the hotel, the staff (A+), the location, and we were happy to come back to it after trekking, eating and shopping all over Barcelona.

No communication was received about the request but when we arrived we were given a small, dark room on the fourth floor with one window looking out onto some back walls of other buildings. The room itself was nice enough, the bed was large, and the bathroom was terrific - large and well-appointed with a great shower. Unfortunately the room had nowhere to sit other than the bed itself which is not terribly comfortable for a multi-day stay. The communal lounge area on the first floor is comfortable though, with a large area inside and an even bigger terrace. When we asked about the room we were given there was a half-hearted response about the fact that the hotel was full and there wasn't anything else available. The second day we were there we again asked if there were any brighter rooms available and were told that you have to request balcony rooms when you make the reservation and pay extra and that the hotel was full. In fact, we would have been happy to pay extra for a better-located room, but that had never been communicated to us in any way. Other than not being terribly helpful about the rooms, the staff seemed ok, friendly enough as we came and left each day. Free wi-fi is a plus in any hotel and the signal here was strong but the internet never worked properly for us. Some sites were never accessible and it was impossible to post blog entries or upload photos or check in for our flights. The PC in the lounge area seemed to connect to sites better than our laptops so maybe the wireless network has some different configurations. After the lukewarm response to our room enquiries, we never did talk with the staff about the wireless problems. The elevator broke on our second day at the hotel. With a room on the 4th floor (with very high ceilings) this was a tiresome inconvenience. The elevator was fixed promptly the next day though. The location is very nice, just a block and a half from Placa Catalunya, very convenient to public transportation, restaurants, shopping and sights. I would really like to say we had a fantastic stay at the hotel but with the internet, elevator and room hassles I would have to say it was just ok.

The guy was gone and a girl in her early twenties was struggling to check in a large family. We waited (standing) in the tiny lobby for 45 mins before she was done with them and we could get her attention. I tried to explain to her that our room should be ready but she insisted someone else before us was waiting for a room so we'd have to wait. Another 30 mins wait plus ten for her to check us in we were so exhausted that I agreed to their full prepayment up front which I wasn't aware of just so we could get it over with and lie down. Finally we get to the room at about 340 an hour and 40 mins after check in and almost three hours after we arrived. But the room is nice and we lie down in blissful rest. Half an hour later woken up by bandsaw/power drilling/hammering next door. Figure it's probably one off and we should explore so we set off out of the room. Fast forward to 9am woken by power tools next door again. We complain and they deny all knowledge of it, say they'll look into it and never call us back. When we head down later we bring it up again and manage to get them to move our room though they do not apologize and infer we're imagining things. (we later find out two other couples on our floor had complained as well.) the rest of the trip went mostly without incident. I should say that the hotel is nice but the staff are borderline incompetent and if a problem arises you will not have a good stay and prepayment makes leaving/refunds impossible.
