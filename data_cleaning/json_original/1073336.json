The best thing about the location is that you are a few blocks away from Orchard Rd and its legendary shopping. We found a great happy hour at an Italian steakhouse on Killiney in the first block toward Orchard with a great happy hour and surprisingly extensive menu, so you don't have to go far for food. When we needed a taxi the concierge would call, and we never had to wait long. The room was spacious and had enough room to sit and bathroom big enough for sharing for a couple. The bath was nice, but sometimes hot water was scarce. Breakfast is adequate, but repetitive. My main comment, though, is about the gym. The treadmill is not suited for running, there is no elliptical trainer at all, no warm up or yoga mats, no water cooler, etc. In short, it did not appear that the exercise room was expected to be used. That was a disappointment because the closest gym is on Orchard and charged 55 sg dollars per day for use. At that price I should have just checked into a more expensive hotel that had a decent gym.", "Date": "February 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "KL", "Title": "\u201cBig rooms, great service!\u201d", "Author": "bt63", "ReviewID": "UR122565826", "Content": "Good location.

For an orchard hotel, OGC has (sometimes) better rate thatn the others around. However, on our Dec 2011 trip, the hotel looks really old. Our room was nothing like a SGD260 room at all. 1. The lighting was very limited. All the furnitures are really outdated. 2. What made it terrible was the non-smoking room was full of smoke during 10pm-3am. A complaint through the front desk didnt result anything. 3. I requested a power adaptor 3pcs (one for laptop, the other one for boiling water and another to charge my camera). The front desk just declined the request and said that they only limit one per each room. They also ask you to sign a form when receiving the power adaptor", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vilonia Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cBest for the money that I have stayed in in Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Lmcintyre57", "ReviewID": "UR120891561", "Content": "I stayed here several years ago and was there off and on for about a year. it is hands down a better bargain the the Landmark Village and is more centrally located to the city center.

One minor drawback: Although I stayed on a non-smoking floor, there was occasional cigarette smell.
