The Meridian seems like it could make for a really great stay in Vegas, with its convenient location, 2 gorgeous pools and lovely plantings on the grounds, the suites themselves tastefully turned out with nice furnishings. But the beauty of the property was matched by the total disaster that was our booking broker, Travel Link. This organization cannot possibly be legitimate, because no legit operation would cause the single worst experience I ever hope to have while traveling. My company booked 9 apartments (the Meridian is a mix of actual homes and condo's for rent) during April 2009 to accommodate our group, two people to each apartment. We booked a YEAR in advance. Travel Link only came up with 7 apartments for us in the end, breaking the contractual promise. Luckily we had one no-show in our group, and someone else stayed in a different place last minute. It was a major battle to obtain the keys..the KEYS to the rooms...a major battle fraught with many phone calls...yes, simple room keys should be a no brainer. It only got worse from there. Some rooms had no power, some had no water, some had no cable. One of the apartments, the rightful owners walked in on us, expecting to stay there themselves for the week, seems Travel Link had somehow given us an apartment that was already occupied? Awkward! Two of the seven apartments literally got seized by the bank DURING our stay. Imagine being on a business trip, coming back to your room from your daytime conference to find a foreclosure notice and your door bolted shut. The police had to be called because my colleagues were unable to get back inside to rescue their belongings! It turned out that in the year since we booked, the Meridian had lost its hotel license and wasn't supposed to be leased, which explained the lack of any normal amenity such as keys, room service, a front desk or concierge, maintenance, Internet, cable or actual access to the place -- we had been promised the gate house for meetings, and poolside breakfast, both of which were denied because of the whole licensing issue. Lack of all those amenities was twice as disappointing, because we had conscientiously sent an advance scout in October, from Boston to Vegas, specifically to confirm all of these details. Who is that careful? We are. But it didn't help, it was all smoke and mirrors. Talk about a bait and switch. From keys to lack of wifi to strangers barging in, so many things went wrong that week that several of us quite literally ended up in tears. And it's not over, Travel Link is still wreaking havoc -- when our credit card bill arrived, it showed that they had charged us not for 7 rooms, but for 18! Shocking. We're still dealing with that fiasco with our credit card fraud division. The only way I would ever recommend the Meridian is if a) you confirm with the city of Las Vegas that they have their hotel license back and b)you do NOT book via Travel Link. I must take a moment to say that the guards patrolling the property and manning the front gate are very courteous, and sympathetic, seems they're all aware of the situation at this place and do their best to at least be kind to the poor walking wounded unlucky enough to have booked a stay.

Since we were driving to Las Vegas the following morning, I was in a real jam to try to find adequate accomodations with such little notice. The reps at Expedia had to try to placate any guests who had booked through them. One of the reps who helped me called the Meridian twice and spoke with Tim, a manager there, who insisted that the best they could do was to give us a room at the Westin (a neighboring hotel). One small room, two beds, for four adult women - not what we had planned. I requested that they at least provide two rooms, but Tim refused. I never did get a full explanation of why this happened, but they could have at least given more notice - if I had cancelled at the last minute, I'd have probably been penalized. I was really glad to have booked through Expedia. Their reps intervened and made sure we had terrific accomodations, matching the great deal we'd gotten at the Meridian.

The rooms were fabulous, we had a two bedroomed suite, which consisted of 1 king sized bed in one room with en-suite bathroom and walk-in closet with french windows onto the balcony. The second bedroom was also very large - queen-sized with separate bathroom, each with its own loo so you can be completely self contained and not need to enter into each others space. The kitchen was fully equipped with full sized american side by side fridge freezer dispensing ice and water. There was a large combi microwave plus cooker and oven and full-sized dishwasher.

The living space is well proportioned and very well decorated in a contemporary way with leather furniture and a huge plasma tv, plus plasmas in both bedrooms (which we didn't use). There is a coffee machine with coffee supplies for guests to use, plus all other self catering equipment. The rooms are fully air conditioned and ours had a washing machine and dryer, iron and board and everything else you might need. The only maintenance issue in the room was my shower door didn't run smoothly and came off the runners on one occasion but these small issues are immediately rectified by Rebekah Desmet the Hotel Manager, who is completely charming and really cares about the guests' well being and ultimate satisfaction. Rebekah went that extra mile to ensure we had the best experience possible during our stay and even bringing the guests out some bottled water to the pool one afternoon. The pool area itself is sublime, with crystal clear water and tropical gardens surrounding the paved area.

But let me go even further into it by saying that after a long Friday my husband and I returned to our room around midnight and went to bed at around 3am we were awakened by rude party goers 1 floor below and we tried to ignore it but after about 20 minutes I called the front desk to see if they could ask them to quiet down. Well it was nearly 4am when I finally got back to sleep. Around 5:56am I woke up since it was quite bright from the beautiful sun when all of a sudden the fire alarm rang! My husband shot up out of bed and my ears where in pain I called the front desk and they said there was no fire and they could not explain why the alarm was going off but did say they were working to stop the alarm......well after about 20 minutes of that scorching alarm we decided to get dressed and out of there and for someone who takes about 2hours to get ready I was out the door at 7:30 and the fire alarm was still ringing! It was horrible! We returned in the afternoon and thankfully the alarm was off but there was no explanation as to what had happened no acknowledgement that anything had gone wrong. I agree with one of the other reviews that mentioned the staff was non existent, we called to have our television fixed and they said maintenence would be over and they never arrived. So when we checked out on Sunday the young man at the front desk did not have an answer for us regarding how they were going to handle waking us up at 6am!!!!on a Saturday morning!! We were not the only ones complaining there were several people who were just as upset, some families had infant children who were awakened and even traumatized by the loud rude awakening. Mary Harvey was supposedly the manager on duty that Sunday and she was unable to be found due to what the young man called \"a real fire\" that she was called to take care of in another building.

I've done strip hotels, downtown hotels, and stayed off strip, but this is the best off strip experience I've had. The Meridian is easy to find, just a couple of blocks off center strip on E. Flamingo. The grounds are luxurious. The pool and jacuzzi open 24 hours as well as the fitness center. While the pool is smaller by Vegas standards, it is lovely and nowhere near as crowded as the big hotels. You will also find BBQ grills for your use during your stay all around the pool area. I was upgraded to a 2 bedroom unit upon arrival, and no, I didn't use the $20 trick. Actually, I didn't even ask for an upgrade. As I was traveling alone I didn't need the 2nd bedroom, but an upgrade is an upgrade! WOW! The photos you'll see at their website are really, truly what the rooms look like. Marble floors in the entryway, kitchen and living room. Huge leather couch, flatscreen tvs, DVD player, marble countertops in the kitchen, all the pots, pans and table ware you need, topped off with beautiful china and stainless steel appliances. Even though the bathrooms aren't huge, they are big and include the rainshower heads. Amenities are not top of the line, but they aren't Super 8 quality either, and I was very happy with them. And the beds? Oh my! Satin stripe linen. Plenty of pillows. Very, very comfortable sleep. The furniture is all high-gloss and dark, but the color scheme of the entire bedroom is comforting and warm. I stayed over Memorial Day weekend, which is generally a high-cost weekend, but my stay at the Meridian was just under $400. To me, considering the property itself, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff and the ease of getting to and from the strip, it was well worth the minimal cost. As a side note, this would be a wonderful place for a honeymoon or for a couple to reconnect. The grounds at night are softly lit and absolutely gorgeous. As for security, I felt absolutely safe at the Meridian. There is a guard at the front gate. You're given a remote for the outer gate, inner gate and the parking garage upon check-in, all of which are very easy to use.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle, Washington", "Title": "\u201cBORING\u201d", "Author": "estpierre", "ReviewID": "UR16467165", "Content": "We stayed at the Meridian for my husband's 35th birthday. All I can say about this place is that it was so boring. If you're looking for the fun and glamour of Las Vegas, stay somewhere else. The property looks like it was a timeshare with multiple buildings and converted one building to a hotel. The rooms were nice, but getting to them felt so isolated and weird, with your rolling suitcases echoing through the desolate parking lot. Normally, when I arrive in Las Vegas, I'm excited for a great time, and arriving to your hotel with a big lobby and beautiful decor always adds to that excitement. My excitement fizzled when I arrived tiny check-in with florescent lights and messy workstations. My distasteful initial reaction actually affected the rest of my trip. The pool accomodations were limited, with no place to buy refreshments, I felt like I was hanging out at my Grandparent's retirement community. Getting a cab was also horrendous, as we discovered from speaking to our cab driver later, that a lot of companies won't go there anymore because the employees have angered them with ordering a cab, then hailing one from the street and leaving the called cab with no fare.

We checked in around 11am which is early since most hotels are 2-3pm and they didn't bat an eye...got us right into a top floor room. So, we walk in and are stunned to see this posh place decked out in leather, marble and granite looking like Ethan Allen came in and furnished the whole place! There was a full kitchen with stainless steel appliances (water/ice maker in fridge door!), really cool square dishes and a full spice rack among other things. Dining room, living room with an awesome flat panel TV and free wireless internet access! Bathroom had tons of space and the bedroom (also had flat panel TV) was beautiful and had a huge closet the length of one whole wall and the doors were all mirrors. There's a coat closet and another closet holding a washer and dryer with detergent already there! The only issue we encountered was that the bathroom faucet was missing the screen so water splashed everywhere...well I briefly mentioned it to the concierge on our way out and we come home a few hours later...voila! Screen on bathroom faucet! There are two gorgeous pools and beautiful lounge chairs that are like big couches...very chic! There are other great amenities that we didn't even get to...like tennis courts, sauna, and more stuff that I can't even remember. The concierge was very helpful with all of our questions, making plans and she recommended some great towns to see and restaurants to eat at. I also found out that this place will stock your fridge before your arrival with anything you want! I think they have a grocery list that they email you. The last day I was concerned because we flew Southwest, we had to check in exactly 24 hours before to get a decent place in \"line\", so I stopped at the front desk to ask if the kiosk they had there would print out my boarding pass and the she said it would but insisted on doing it for me! They were so helpful! Housekeeping did an excellent job every day. It was very quiet...we barely ran into anyone. I really liked that you could go to the Strip for all the action and come back to a nice quiet relaxing place to sleep off all the partying ;) I can not say enough good things about this place.

However, the pool cushions are really dirty. (You must lay towels down on the cushions to avoid sitting on dirt) The pool decking is really dirty and did not want to walk barefoot on it. The bbq's at the pool are just plain disgusting and would never in a million years cook on them. The other thing that was real disturbing was that I stayed on the 4th floor and the flooring is just unsightly. All the paint is peeling and coming up and it looks like the floor has not been swept in years. Just plain unacceptable.

We ended up trying to hail a cab from the Koval gate of the complex and were able to hail just one. The Strip is walking distance but if you must take a cab, you're better off walking over to the Westin Casuarina's taxi stand across the street. The suites were fully equipped with a washer/dryer and all kitchen utensils and appliances (including a blender!). Beware, however, of dishes in the cabinet. We pulled out a couple of dishes with food still stuck to them!

This is something I always pay close attention to anywhere I go. Admittedly the pool lounges could use some updated cushions but other than that the pool area was a nice little haven. I sat in the jacuzzi and did not feel like it was dirty at all. The pool was heated and well maintained. There was beautiful landscaping around the pool. As far as the hallways and common areas, they were also very well-maintained (NOT dirty!). I am into being CLEAN and staying in a CLEAN and well-maintained facility. Our apartment was thoroughly cleaned every day and any employee I saw was always working hard to keep the place looking great. I would rate this complex as Above Average (I would have given it Excellent ratings if the pool lounge cushions were updated and better maintained).

Easy access to main roads and we felt very secrue as its a gated complex. Location was good for us but we never walked to the strip. Honestly, I was a little bit surprised at the distance...its definately in walking distance but keep in mind its 2-3 gigantic blocks from the strip with several alleys and side roads in between the complex and the Blvd. Depending on where your accomodations are, it might take several minutes to just get to the main road outside the complex. I would say closer to a 15 minute walk to the strip. We always drove up to Imperial Palace (our friends were staying there) and used the valet.

I picked the Meridian because a.) the price I found on Travelzoo, b.) the reviews I had read online, and c.) the fact that it had a kitchen, which was important to me because of my daughter. Overall, I thought the Meridian was nice, although I encountered some significant issues with the hotel that would most likely keep me from staying there again. The Pluses: The rooms are very nice. It's obvious they had been remodeled recently. The marble floors, the granite counters, the stainless steel appliances, the 2 lcd TV's were great. The 1 bedroom suite that I got was clean, tidy, and spacious. The room had a nice leather sofa and chair, the kitchen was stocked with plates, glasses, silverware, cooking utensils, and a coffee maker. The washer/dryer was a fantastic convenience, as I was able to to laundry whenever I needed. The Minuses: My first complaint is the location. It's not so much where it is, but the fact that it's hard to get anywhere from the hotel. While attending NAB, I walked to the Flamingo each morning to take the monorail to the convention center. This walk is not trivial, as you have to pass under the monorail, go into the Flamingo, then walk BACK on the walkway to the station. From hotel room to monorail platform is a minimum of 12 minutes. Now, you do this twice a day, walk all around a convention center, and you have sore feet by the end of day 3. Also, there is NO grocery store within walking distance. One day I stopped at one of the gas stations/quickie marts on the way and could only find a handful of provisions that I would eat. Further down on Flamingo there is an Albertson's, but you would have to drive to get there. My wife and I took a cab one night to the CVS next door to get a prescription and it cost $20.... Speaking of cabs, it seems difficult to get one at the Meridian. Sunday morning my wife and I had a 7:10am flight out of McCarran. We called the front desk at 5am to get a cab. They said it would take 5 to 10 minutes. By the time we walked to the front gate 10 mins later.... no cab. I went to the front desk to check, and they said they would call again. 10 mins later... no cab. Needless to say, I was getting perturbed. At 5:35am I finally went to the street and hailed one driving by. Ridiculous....... If the hotel is reading this, I would strongly suggest having a shuttle that runs at the very least to the strip every half hour or so. That would make life SO much easier for guests. Also, work out the cab issue. Any other hotel on the strip has a queue of taxi's waiting at a moment's notice...... Another thing I wasn't crazy about was the housekeeping service. 2 days in row we had no service. One of the days we called the front desk and they did come to clean our room while we were at dinner.... the next night we came back from a long day out and nothing had been touched. It was frustrating to come back to a dirty room with a pile of dirty towels and sheets..... that reminds me..... I'm not sure they change the bedsheets. One day my daughter spilled something on the sheets.... after housekeeping came, we noticed they had just made the bed back up, stains and all. My next issue is internet service. Although they have cable modems in each room, I could NOT get it to work. I have worked in IT for 12 years now, so I think I can troubleshoot something as simple as a network connection. For reference, my father, who stayed down the hall from us, could not get his to work either. The only internet available was in the business center (you have to pay to use the computer) or WiFi by the pool. So, I basically had to walk down the pool every morning to check my email. Ok, I know it's not torture or anything, but it sure would have been nice to be able to do that from my room..... Speaking of the pool, I will say that it is pretty nice. The pool is in good condition, lots of chairs and tables... even grills that you could use for a poolside cookout. My complaint is that many/most of the chair cushions are badly stained, have cigarette burns in them, or both. I have stayed at several places in Vegas.... the Palms, the Venetian, the Bellagio, the Hyatt at Lake Las Vegas (Now Loew's) and the Ritz Carlton. That being said, I think the room at the Meridian ranked right in the mix with quality of those other hotels, with the added perks of the kitchen and washer/dryer. What the hotel is really lacking is the service those other hotels provide. If you want to get people to come to your hotel, you MUST focus on that.... In conclusion.... while I got a great rate on my room, I go to Vegas for the experience. I will pay more in the future for a better location and better customer service. For me it's worth it to add a few hundred dollars to my vacation to have someone say, \"Welcome back, Mr. Martin\" when I walk back into my hotel. For that reason, I will most likely not stay at the Meridian again.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "detroit, mi", "Title": "\u201cwhat a pleasant surprise!!!\u201d", "Author": "sweetdannid", "ReviewID": "UR15175827", "Content": "i must say that this hotel was alot better than i thought it would be. i received a promotion rate email from hotwire.com about the meridan. i was going to las vegas, on business and it was a last minute trip.(by the way, this hotel always have some kind or promotional discount rate. just call them directly and they will hook up you up). it is an all suite hotel and gated. the thing is they have a few actual residents that live in a few of the suites. there vision is for half the resort to be occupied by residents and the other half the hotel. they offer studio, 1, and 2 bedroom suites. they also have a 2bdrm w/den, but i didnt look at that one. the rooms are beautifully decorated w/leather furniture, california king-sized beds, full kitchens w/stainless steel appl, and every room has a balcony. they offer free wi-fi and the cable provider is cox communications. this hotel has 2 swimming pools, full fitness center(24hr), raquetball court, bball court, and a dry sauna. the pics of the website look exact like the rooms. you know how you look at pics of the rooms and it looks like they take pics of every angle of their suites, then make it seem like all the rooms look like those pics? not the case here. the only knocks i have on the hotel are as follows: at the time that i arrived, there wasnt a bellmen on staff. so i had to carry all of my bags myself and there was alot of walking and stairs. the hotel is separated by building(1-7). once you get inside the gate of your building, its fine because you can take an elevator to get to you room. also, you cant order movies. this isnt your typical hotel where you can press a button and order a movie. lastly(i dont see this as a knock, but others might), the hotel is located a couple blocks off the strip. there is a walk involved. the good thing is when you get to the corner of flamingo and las vegas blvd, you bump right into casears palace and ballys. overall, this place this freakin great. i would certainly recommend this apartment style living hotel to anyone. i hope this helps. again, dont forget to call about promotional discount rates. regular price, the hotel can be on the expensive side. the discount rates are well worth it.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cLuxurious and Hidden\u201d", "Author": "Pinkflamingo220", "ReviewID": "UR14963425", "Content": "This property is a luxury resort with the convenience of condo living.

I thought I should write this review as I am extremely picky about accommodations. This is a large complex so request rooms close to what you want entrances ,pools etc. and you will enjoy your stay more. You really can't beat the price for Vegas for what you get. We had considered the larger strip hotels but where so thankful we chose the Meridian instead. The larger hotels were extremely crowded, and noisy and it takes forever to get to their pools ,or your room, or through the casinos, due to their size. We took a limo from the airport because the taxi lines are so long, The concierge Debbie did a great job. You can send her a customized grocery list prior to your arrival for a minimal fee., $10.00 and your kitchen will be stocked prior to your arrival. Check out their online concierge service , it was well worth it . The hotel provides coffee, laundry and bath amenities. Our condo location was perfect, right next to the pool. with balcony overlooking it . The room was very clean ( not immaculate). Furnishings were top of the line -kitchen appliances sub zero fridge, viking/wolf gas stove ,bedding high quality linen, bath travertine and granite and toilet self flushing and heated, plasma TV's in both rooms, nice leather furniture and teak dining table. Walk in closet. Washer and dryer. Nice carpet and paint. No problem with the drapes/sunlight. Daily maid service. Our room must had been recently updated. Please note the plumbing was just the reverse of normal hot for cold and cold for hot in both the kitchen sink and the tub. The Meridian has 2 pools -the one near the club house is the nicer. Perfect location! It is only a 7-8 min walk to the monorail stations at either Ballys or the Flamingo and just a few more minutes to the strip to Caesars and Bellagio.. A cab is not needed; Liquor store on the same street as you walk towards the strip. Ellis Island within one block- $6.99 steak special. . Other restaurants Lawrys and Bahama Breeze within 2 blocks or 10 min walk. We would recommend eating at Marrekech if you like Morrocan and belly dancing-but take a cab. No concern about safety as the community is gated with security guards and entrance cards required. If you have guests arriving just notify the front desk. Nice grounds and very quiet.. We took a cab back to the airport. the front desk can get you one. It arrived within 3 min and we were at the airport in 10 min -$12.50. We would definitely stay at the Meridian again.

Having stayed on the strip on previous trips to Las Vegas, I had a few concerns with being off the beaten path but upon our arrival we were thrilled with our decision. Because of an early morning flight into Las Vegas, we arrived at the Meridan at 11am thinking we would have to wait to check in but were informed that our \"room\" was ready and that we were upgraded to a 2br unit. Although we never used the second bedroom, we were delighted to have so much room. The second bathroom certainly came in handy. The gal who brought us to our unit infomed us that the complex had been built 12 years ago as residential condos and within the past 2 years had gone through updating of each unit to convert them to rental units. Our unit looked pretty much like the photos on line, what you see is what you get. Other reviews mentioned issues with cleanliness and I cannot say it was a problem for us. Keep in mind these units were built 12 years ago so not all is brand new and the furnishings are not top of the line quality and there were a few chips in the paint where suitcases most likely were the culprit. If your the type that wants nothing less than 5 star you may not be totally satisfied but overall I think it might be one of the best values in town. We had very little interaction with the front desk, only at check in and check out. The work out facility was above average. The pool area was a relaxing retreat from the business of the city. We sort of felt like this was two vacations in one. I was hoping to make better use of the kitchen but there is no supermarket in the area. Just several small gas station/mini markets in the area where we picked up a few items. If you have room in your luggage, pack a few food items, you'll be glad you did. The walk to the strip was not a big issue, stop at Bill's when you get to the strip for a 98cent margarita! I will say it again, overall we were delighted with our stay at the Meridian. At $129 per night it was great. We'll definitely be back.

We wanted an affordable place on or near the strip with a kitchen so we could provide some of our own meals. This hotel, which I stumbled upon on Travelzoo.com, was one of the nicest I've had in Vegas, and I've stayed at many LV hotels. We had a few smallish issues, but I consider these minor \"nits,\" noted here only to help your decision. LOCATION / LAYOUT: On Flamingo, about 10-12 minutes from the room to Bally's, The Meridian is truly walkable to the strip. There is no dining on site, but it is adjacent to Lawry's, and within 2-3 minutes of several restaurants on Flamingo. It's directly across from a small local casino (I forget the name). Overall, this is a very convenient location, and close to the airport. There are 7 (?) condo complexes, each 4 stories plus underground garage. You get assigned parking - a HUGE plus if you have a car - and secure entrance (gated entry to complex and garage). If you are having visitors, make sure the gate security is aware, otherwise they may not get in (just ask my mom :-) POOL / GROUNDS: Well maintained grounds. The pool was very nice, but modest in comparison to the gi-normous pools of hotels like Mirage or Bellagio. Lots of comfortable seating and a very large (15' diameter) hot tub. The complex was relatively quiet, a kind of oasis close to the Strip. -- NIT - they advertise the pool as heated to 79 degrees. It felt cooler than that, perhaps closer to 70, so it was a bit cool for my taste. ROOM - A 1BR condo (they also have 2 BR and studios), this well appointed, clean, up to date room was very comfortable. The bedroom had a comfortable king bed, very large closet space and bureau. The living room / dining area had leather sofas, and both the LR and BR had cable flat screens. The deck was standard apartment size, enough for a small table and 2 chairs, which worked well. We had a view of a few of the hotels on the strip. -- NIT: One of the sofas was in front of the deck entrance, making entry and exit to the deck a nuisance. The shades in the BR were not well fit, and thus let in a good amount of light; I prefer darker window treatments. The clock radio in the MBR was a pain. I understand all manner of electronics, and could not figure out how to turn the radio off. KITCHEN - exactly what we needed, this kitchen, smallish but functional, had a full size refrigerator/freezer, gas stove / oven, d/w and enough dishware, glassware, storage and such for our purposes. We had breakfast and lunch here most days and, as a result, saved a lot of money. The hotel had a grocery service, very convenient and relatively reasonably priced. -- NIT: I'd add a few more plates and perhaps a quality frying pan . OTHER ROOM THINGS: It was very convenient having a washer/dryer in the room - great plus! Housekeeping provided laundry detergent upon request. The TV had problems, but a call to the front desk had it repaired within the hour. I loved hanging out on the deck. The bathroom had a rainshower (large) showerhead; this was OK but underwhelming. The rooms were all well kept, clean, modern and very comfortable. SERVICE - generally attentive. I had the sense that the front desk staff was not particularly experienced (they were a bit hesitant on a few things), but they were certainly pleasant and focused on customer satisfaction. -- NIT - The desk told us they could not tell which rooms had sofabeds and which did not. As someone with a hotel background, I found this odd. We compensated by bringing a $30 air mattress, but would've preferred to confirm a sofa bed. Also, be sure to ask for the entrance code to the secure gates throughout the complex; the desk only gives the pool code upon check-in. OVERALL - The Meridian met or exceeded all the expectations of my family and I (wife and daughter shared the room). It's a great place if you want more space for rates at or below the major hotels. That said, the major hotels generally have more activity, casinos, on-site entertainment and dining, and in some cases more of a WOW-factor for their pools. I highly recommend The Meridian if you want to be close to, but not actually on top of, the strip and it's activities.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Foothill Ranch, California", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice!\u201d", "Author": "Jrdry", "ReviewID": "UR14347830", "Content": "Spent a Friday night with the boys at the Meridian.
