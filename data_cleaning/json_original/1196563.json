The staff and other guest are like your family and you immedeately start feeling home. Though it is not a luxury hostal. But the atmosphere is the best of all the hostals in Playa del Carmen and the location - 2 blocks from the beach, 1-3 blocks from the party-zone- is just great! I can highly recommend every one to stay at this friendly and welcoming place!", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, fun vibe\u201d", "Author": "grippyjaxx", "ReviewID": "UR116541211", "Content": "they give u clean towels.

The social scene was good but since its not a huge bar, even sleeping in the dorms near the rooftop bar you can still sleep. It had A.C which was great, most places in the same price range don't. I have conversational spanish, which was great because most of the staff don't speak very much English.
