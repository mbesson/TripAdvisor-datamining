First impression was a very very disorganised front desk. it would have been comical except I was a paying guest. I should have realised the error of my ways when a Chinese resident was trying to ask for something in poor English, the receptionist just couldn't be bothered to try and understand his needs and practically ignored him whilst she did something else. My own check-in person (who was Russian) was so cold and matter of fact about things I thought I was in Russia! Room decor was appropriate for the hotel class, but then I noticed I'd been given a smoking room that stank of stale cigarettes, when I spoke to the Russian receptionist to change rooms, she informed me that there are only 2 designated non smoking floors for the whole hotel (hotel has at least 16 floors) which I guess is a great ratio if you are a smoker, and I got the clear impression my Russian girl was saying I should start smoking......she begrudgingly offerred to send house-keeping to spray air freshner.....he came promptly was a nice kid, but he used some weapons grade fumicide spray or something that really iritated my throat, and guess what the windows don't open... There was a constant banging and drilling going on somewhere nearby, very annoying. Next thing, connecting to the internet was a nightmare, same Russian girl again, told me what to do but sternly warned me there was an hourly charge, fine I said, alas, it didn't work, you had to enter your room number which it promptly said didn't exist....so Russian girl said she would send up an 24hr internet voucher but, she warned me would cost AED100, fine I said, I just needed to do some work. 30 mins later I decided to go down to front desk to get it myself, where I had to sign for the crappy internet voucher before getting it, I thought I would mention the civil engineering work on-going in the room next door, to which Russian girl replied, Oh its ok they should be finished by 18.00 it their end of shift!! I then asked for my passport back as I wanted to go out (passport is required to be scanned on arrival), however they were so disorganised when i checked in they said they would do it and return it later.....guess what I'm still waiting for it as I write this review. My booking is room only so no breakfast included, anywhere else i've stayed would have been upgraded or comped for that at least.

There is a very small gym on the second floor. The trainer attached to the club spends all his time in there watching tv, which can be off putting. The 'traditional British pub' is ghastly.

Charging for internet access (15Dhs/hour or 100Dhs/24hr, both valid for 24hours) really annoys me. It should be free in a 1000Dhs a night hotel.
