However, my room was clean, there was a very good choice of breakfast items in the refrectory dinning hall, the security staff were very friendly and above all other factors it was extremley good value for London accommodation and in a very central location - 5 minutes bus journey from Kings Cross, 25mins from London Bridge and 30 from Waterloo. On my first night my key turned constantly and didn't work but when I told the secuity staff he moved me to another room.

I prefer the bus, but Angel tube station is very easy to get to. Easy access to Shoreditch, the City, Islington, Holborn, Soho, and South Bank. The room was small, but, yes, it's a dorm. I stayed in a single and since I wasn't there a lot, it suited my needs. I did bring my own sleep sack and was glad I did because while the sheets appeared clean, there were quite a few strands of hair sticking to things that weren't mine--ick. Though I didn't have it often, the breakfast was much better than I expected. An array of hot foods, pastries, yogurt, fruit, and cereal. The majority of the staff, by email and in person, were amiable and helpful. Only once did I encounter a girl who couldn't seem to be able to tear her eyes away from a computer monitor to answer a simple question. Things that could've been better: 1. WiFi---I really don't care if I can now use it for free at a nearby cafe. How hard is it to sell vouchers to LSE's basic wifi, which one can pick up in the room and common areas? I've never quite understood why British businesses are averse to making money. 2. Selling water and disabling the drinking fountain in the cafeteria is beyond cheap. Seriously? Water's kind of a necessity for, well, life. 3. A better system for getting a new towel. While I don't need a new one every day, I had to leave a note more than once to get a fresh one. 4.

The last straw was when workers broke an expensive bottle of wine I had left in my room, and I got back at the end of the day to a carpet soaked in wine, the room reeking of alcohol (they didnt even bother to change my room for me), and a note saying they'll replace the bottle (they never did, and the management claimed no responsibility).
