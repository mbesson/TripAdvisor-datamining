All the key attractions - the Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Restaurants etc are a short walk away. The trams are close by as well. The hotel premises are small, but the rooms are fairly large (bathrooms decent size) and can comfortably provide for a couple with two large suitcases. There is no self-catering coffee and tea facility in the rooms, but the hotel management has no issues in your making coffee and taking it up to your room in the morning. Breakfast is limited, functional. If you have time, don't miss dinner on the terrace restaurant which has stunning view at night.

I did a stop over from spending a couple of weeks touring India. This hotel is a boutique hotel. It has approximately 20 rooms and very very personable. They speak English and are very helpful with tours and pre-paid airport shuttle service back to the airport (only 15 TLs). The hotel room has all what you need and it looks like what you see on the hotel.com websites etc. I found the location very ideal and best for a tourist. All the great must see places are waking distance or a short Trem ride. The breakfast was god they served most Europeans which is very understandable. However, food plenty to get you ready for all the walks. I found the bed great to sleep. The bathroom was very clean and cared for. The shower doors did have a challenge for they did not closed exactly tight and therefore I would leak water most times. The heater levels were a tad loud so keep it so very low and you will not have an issue. The TV needed some instructions at the start. However there are TV English channels but you have to search for them, many many channels to watch them. The hotel location is easy to return from your shopping spree since the hotel is so close to the happening places and of course the eateries too. Ask the front desk clerk for the hotel shuttle back which is a heck of alot cheaper than the taxis upon arrival at the airport.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Canada", "Title": "\u201cCentrally located, good service, clean\u201d", "Author": "seema60", "ReviewID": "UR127866955", "Content": "We stayed here for two nights in April.

I enjoyed the roof terras restaurant as well at night and tried some of the beautiful Turkish wines they have on the list. Great fun with a great view!! I can recommend this hotel if you look for value and a great experience. I stayed for leasure, but I suppose it is excellent for the business traveler as well.

The lobby restaurant/breakfast area is small and has no real redeeming features. The upstairs terrace offers great views of the Bosphorus but was not open for breakfast during my visit. It was available for dinner if you ask nicely.. This was low season for sure but I was also disapointed in the quality of the food for dinner and the price is about 30% more expensive as items on their menu are displayed in Euros when all other restaurants display it in Liras. My main complaint was the paper thin walls !! Ugh. Even with the TV at moderate level I could hear the couple next door go at it and all their conversations felt like they were actually in my room. The room is small but most are in this part of IST. Bed was OK comfortable. Bathroom was OK. So location is probaby its best feature and price was good and fair. I just think you can do better.

It's perfectly located near the Blue Mosque and lots of shops and restaurants in the Sultanahmet area of Istanbul. But this area is full of hotels, so you can definitely shop around. You could tell that Daphne Hotel had been in the area for a while, but they are actually in the process of completing a renovation project. All new wood, cabinetry, and bathroom fixings...one area they've forgotten are the beds. They are not comfy! The breakfast was continental and had plenty of options. Lots of cheese, meats, fruit, breads, drinks and more. When we checked in, room 401 had yet to receive a new tub...it was quite unattractive (mold). Plus we had a smoking neighbor and their smoke was seeping underneath our door...though Europe is trying to embrace the 'non-smoking' in public places like hotels, this is quite hard to enforce in a society that loves to smoke. They had a monetary fine for smoking in the rooms, but I doubt they use it. As a result of the mold and smoking, we asked for another room. We moved one floor down to 301 and it was ok. The view from that side of the building is beautiful. Definitely request room 301, 401 (once completely renovated) or 501. They each have a view of the Marmara Sea. There are always ships at sea and the sunsets are very nice. The staff is very helpful also. They also offered free transfer between the hotel and the airport (roundtrip). This was a nice perk.

Moving us to adjoining rooms which were really wonderfully big, with sea view! Really made us have a 2 room suite-style set up. They made reservations for us, called taxis, went out to the taxis with us and gave explicit directions to the drivers to ensure we got to where we were going. Really, they exceeded our expectations!

Its on a quiet little street with tons of atmosphere, has breathtaking views of the sea and is about 5 minutes from Sultanahmet square with its tram station, the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, cisterns, various monuments and a host of little tourist-trap eateries. For the overwhelmed there is also a McDonalds and a Starbucks across the street from each other and 2 minutes from the tram station. And if you're relieved to hear that, shame on you! :) Interestingly, 5 minutes walk from the hotel in the opposite direction will take you to a totally Turkish neighbourhood with tiny twisty cobbled streets, little coffee shops and bakeries and fruit sellers and so forth. Just a word of warning: Sultanahmet is very hilly! If you have difficulty walking be prepared to take it slow. Trip Advisor's star rating shows this as a 4 star. That is patently not the case. I've written a separate comment in Forums about TA's rating system because I think it leads to disappointment and consequent ruined holidays and bad reviews. Daphne is a GOOD 2 - 3 star. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The decor is clean if slightly baroque/opulent so it might feel like your grandma's formal sitting room but that's the style in Turkey, echoing past glory and days of empire as it were. Don't be put -off, its in no way overpowering but just be prepared for lots of facsimile damask fabrics and fake crystal beads hanging off everything. The doors open with an electronic card which must then be slotted in to a holder to get the electricity to work. You can't actually lock or bolt the door from the inside but staff respect the Do Not Disturb if you hang it out. Just once the cleaning crew knocked to ask but that was around noon and they wondered if we'd forgotten to take off the sign. We asked if they could come later and they agreed immediately with a smile. From that point on we were not disturbed again. The bathrooms are spacious enough and everything works fine. Standard free toiletries provided along with disposable slippers and shoe-shine paper. The cleaning staff are slightly perfunctory. They come in and tidy and make your bed but I'm not certain that they actually scrub anything on a daily basis. Certainly our towels were only changed once in 6 days. Didn't bother us but might irk some. On the same topic, you read lots of reviews (in Istanbul hotels) of theft from the rooms. We had stuff all over; cash, laptops, cameras etc etc. Not a thing missing. They have a gorgeous rooftop terrace where they serve lunch and dinner and drinks in the evening. It has a wide open unobstructed view of the sea and if you look back over your shoulder you'll see the minars of the blue mosque a few hundred meters away. By the way, watching the sun set from this terrace is an experience not to miss. They also have a lobby level restaurant where they serve the free buffet breakfast and other meals a la carte. The breakfast buffet is generous and good quality. Standard Turkish fare of breads, cheeses, olives, fresh and dried fruit and pastries along with a variety of cereals, teas and coffee. The a la carte menu looked a bit expensive. In any case, we were never in at meal times so didn't get to try. We also didn't try room service. There was a menu from the restaurant placed on the writing table in the room; I don't actually know if it was purely for the restaurant or whether they can serve in your room if asked. There's a laptop in the lobby for hotel guests to use and wifi throughout. Its not superfast but hey its free! We found we could get on to another unsecured network that had better signal strength in our room and we mostly used that. By the way, we all know not to reveal credit card or personal information on public wifi networks right? Just a friendly Public Service Announcement! I'd just add that to a large extent your hotel experience can depend on your fellow guests. We didn't see any large charter tour groups or anything like that while we were here. Groups of 3 or four grown up friends, a small gang of highly adventurous (and entertaining) American retirees, couples, a family or two with teenage kids. So the atmosphere was very nice. The only negative is that though we had a non-smoking room, smoke would filter in at night from some person or persons smoking either in the stairwell and corridors or in another room. We never did find out which. The night receptionist explained that there are smoking and non-smoking rooms on each floor and it could be from that. Easy solution would be to segregate smoking and non-smoking floors but I'm sure they'll figure it out eventually. And the other caveat, though not really a negative, is that hotels in Turkey generally have poor sound insulation. Its endemic so there's no point in complaining about this one. You'll hear the water from your neighbour's bathroom, you'll hear people in the corridors and so on. But the Daphne's location is very quiet and in general we were very relaxed and peaceful. Of course you hear the call to prayer at dawn but that's part of the deal in Sultanahmet and it would be silly to act surprised. A special shout out for Okam at the front desk. A thoroughly charming, multi-lingual man who treats you like a guest in his home. It was a working holiday for me and as my partner is 6 months pregnant it was to be our last trip away before the baby.

They took us to an awful smoky smelling apartment the next block over for one night and promised us their best room in order to make up for the inconvenience. The next morning, we sought out the manager and he offered us a free meal on the roof deck that night to further compensate for the inconvenience. There were a lot of traditional Turkish dishes advertised on sign boards outside the hotel and on the regular hotel menu; we didn't get to choose any of them. We were served the cheapest food possible - chicken legs, potatoes, cabbage salad. All was well-prepared, but we'd already had our taste buds set for other specific menu items. They served rice pudding for dessert. My husband liked it; I can't even force myself to swallow rice pudding no matter where it's served (something about the texture turns me off), so i asked for something else and was served a piece of chocolate cake that had obviously been frozen for a very, very long time; the texture was really dry and grainy, the frosting was frozen yet melt-y at the same time and the cake tasted of freezer burn. We were very disappointed w/ the fact that they didn't truly intend to 'make it right' by allowing us to choose what we wanted to eat. The room we got was certainly not a suite as promised by the manager, but it wasn't awful either; it was what we expected to get when we booked at the hotel initially - a basic double room. We did have a tiny balcony (w/ no place to sit) from which we had a partial sea view. The worst part is that a day later, 2 couples came to check in while we were at breakfast (breakfast was always in lobby, not on roof as advertised on their web site, even though the weather couldn't have been more perfect). We could easily overhear the check in process from where we were sitting and they were each told that the people occupying their rooms had gotten sick and couldn't leave until the next day. They put the 2 couples in nearby accommodations as well, telling them they would receive the best rooms in the hotel and a free dinner on the roof terrace. What's the likelihood of 3 different guests taking ill/deciding to stay extra w/in the space of 2 days? And how does everyone get the best room in the house? This, of course, made us wonder if this was some sort of scam whereby they overbook the hotel, put people in other (less desirable) places they own for a night or two, then offer 'the best room' and a free (but cheap) meal that they choose for you and still collect the room rate for all nights (double) booked. Weird. All that said, the place is clean and decent. The breakfast is typical of what one expects to get while on the continent (they serve filter coffee - no Nescafe!). However, there was only one server/bellman/bus boy working. He was supposed to bus tables, replenish the breakfast buffet, coffee, juice, water, etc and also take care of running people's bags to the other properties when their rooms weren't available. There were times we didn't even bother asking for more coffee or whatever. We felt pretty bad for the poor guy. Our dinner service was very slow for the same reason (server running up and down from roof to kitchen and multitasking), but it was fine for us since we wanted a leisurely dinner. The car service to and from the airport was punctual and the drivers polite and professional.

Many of the hotels in this area boast of great terrace (rooftop) views, usually of the Blue Mosque. But a lot of the pictures you see advertised on their sites or from travelers' photos, are zoomed shots. The actual view usually includes unsightly run-down neighboring building rooftops, with the mosque at a distance. The view from the terrace here is of the sea. It is really, really nice. Highly recommended for couples, as the view is really romantic, especially at sunset and at night. Since this is a very small boutique hotel, the terrace (rooftop) is usually empty late at night, which is nice for couples who would like to share some private time enjoying a great sea view. =D Complimentary breakfast downstairs every morning is solid. Assortment of meat cuts, breads, pastries, fruit, coffee, etc. You can sit next to the big open window, where you can enjoy a few passerbys walking along the small cobblestone road while you eat.

It's easy to see why two of our family members came down with severe diarea after having breakfast at the hotel. They also should really cover the food if they're going to keep the windows open during the summer. Otherwise flies and bees are a common site on the food.

Walk 5 mins along the Bosphorus and you come to Dolmabace Palace which is a lovely place to visit. Istanbul is a very safe place to visit. (Of course the usual rules for visiting any city apply though) The Turks are friendly and many speak excellent English although nearly all of them seem to have a relative with a carpet shop and if you go with them it's two hours of your life you will never have back again.... Just smile and keep walking! The hotel is not large and most of the rooms have a super view of the Sea of Marmara. You can see 50 ships at a glance waiting there for their turn to go along the Bosphorus to the Black Sea. The staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are now all renovated with a Turkish twist and the en suite bathrooms are very nice indeed. The beds are super comfortable!!
