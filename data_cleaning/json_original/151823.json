For 2011/2012 Christmas & New Years holiday we decided to make it special. We wanted to spend it on the island. We had stayed at the San Juan Beach several years ago when they were under renovations. We took that into consideration and put up with the inconveniences, it was a good stay. So we looked at the web site for 2011 and saw what appeared to be new pictures of completed renovations, and booked a 10 day stay. WOW!! What a shock we got when we arrive to find that the owner(s), shifted the emphasis from customer service to greed. The lobby was beautifully redone although simple. A restaurant El Perurrican) had been added, but you must be into strictly seafood (Not much diversity). The free breakfast that was served during our last stay was done away with. We assumed too make way for much better accommodations. WRONG! When we entered the room what a shock we got to find that it smelled musty, was very dirty and with stained carpets. The bathroom was full of mold, mildew, and rust. All the bathroom fixtures had mold, mildew and rust. The window shades were broken so you had to take them down and roll them by hand. The air conditioner (although it worked) sounded like a freight train all night, so we convinced ourselves that it was the sound of the ocean in our room so that we could sleep. We did have an ocean view room (which we payed extra for) We could not get room service to leave us clean towels, and the sheets were not changed. Only the bed was remade again and again for 10 days with the same sheets. I believe we had bedbugs, because we were itching all night an in the morning we both had bites all over our bodies. (we marked the sheets, to make sure). No coffee machine, NO blow dryer although the blow dryer plate was attached to the wall. On the third day we took a ride on the elevator, and were joined by 4 housekeepers. I am Puerto Rican and speak the language my wife is Irish/Italian and only understands it a little bit. Well these 4 housekeepers were discussing in Spanish, how pissed (Encojona) they were that, tourist would not leave the hotel until noon or after, thus causing them to be delayed in their duties. And that they could not find a room on a higher floor where they could watch TV and rest. At check out they attempted to charge us for 10 days of valet parking at $18 a day knowing full well that we only used the valet parking for 7 days, the valets were very good and pleasant . When we did try to launch a complaint the only person we could find did not appear to care about our problems.

The past year we decided to stay elsewhere due to the lobby of the San Juan Beach Hotel being remodeled. We figured that since the lobby was redone, the rooms would have been updated also. Not so.

The lobby was redone to lure in the unsuspected tourists into thinking that the rest of the hotel would be as elegant. The room had furniture from about 15 years ago, the sheets on the bed were not changed until we called to request them after 4 days. We placed a mark on the sheets to see how long it would take them to change the linens. We started itching after the first night only to find that there were bed bugs. The bathroom was disgusting, tub stained, towels not picked up unless we requested clean ones to be delivered. The air conditioner kept us up all night for the 10 nights that we were there. We complained about the noise it was making and were told that all the units were the same. Unbelievable. When going out for the day, we also placed our bags in a certain position where as if they were moved or tampered with, we would know. Yes, they were gone through. Needless to say, we were so frustrated that we decided to stay with family for most of our visit. The beach was not a beach at all. Walk down to what they call a beach and you will find nothing but rocks everywhere. Not a space big enough to place a chair or towel. You are not allowed to lay on their beach. Disaster area.

Not Worth it!\u201d", "Author": "moyteali", "ReviewID": "UR99903714", "Content": "I stayed at this place for 6 nights (March 2nd through March 8th). I read a lot of reviews, so I thought I knew what I was going to get, but I was wrong! I was expecting a 2.5 to 3 star hotel, for a really great price, but it was more like an overpriced .5 to 1 star motel. The place is a real dump. It ruined my vacation. I didn't spend much time in the room, but after a day of sightseeing or being at the beach, I dreaded heading back to the rooms. The staff was extremely rude, especially the manager named Jessica. The rooms were disgusting. They say they are renovating, but I didn't see any work being done. It looks like they gave the lobby a cheap makeover (I say cheap, because it looks like it is already falling apart) but the rooms haven't been touched. The elevators were old and shook the whole time going up or down. The carpet was stained and smelled like mold was growing under it. When we first walked in our room on the 9th floor, it looked like all they did was make the bed. There was still garbage in the drawers and it was definitely not vacuumed. The TV was old and we only got reception for 4 or 5 channels. CNN, HLN & TNT were the only channels we could watch. They didn't even have ABC, CBS, NBC or FOX (I really wanted to watch American Idol!). They still use metal keys instead of card keys, which you have to leave with the front desk if you want your room cleaned. We did this, but all they did was make the bed. The sheets weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t changed and they floor still wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t vacuumed. Also, if you lost the key, they were going to charge you $75. The room had two medium sized windows that faced the beach, but they were very old and didn't stay open. If we wanted to smell fresh air, we had to hold them open, which was difficult because they were very heavy. The day after we checked in, Jessica and two other hotel employees, came banging on our door, asking to come in to smell our room because they suspected that we were smoking in the room. I told her this was ridiculous because neither of us smoke! She gave me a dirty look as if I was lying to her and threatened to charge me $250. Meanwhile, almost everyday we smelled smoke in the hall, which was definitely not coming from our room. The day we were checking out, I realized I didn't have cash for the taxi to take us to the Airport ($20 from the hotel), so I asked the doorman to watch our bags while we ran to the store 3 blocks away to use the ATM. When we returned our bags were missing. We tried to ask him where our bags were, but he brushed us off and said wait. I knew something wasn't right because I couldn't see my bags anywhere. I had to go to the front desk to have them ask him where our bags were. The doorman had put our bags in someone else's taxi. I freaked out because I thought our bags were gone for good. Thankfully there was taxi driver hanging out outside the hotel who happened to know the driver who had our bags. He called him up on his cell and had him meet us at the airport to give us back our bags. We barely made our flight home. This place was a nightmare. While we were staying there we decided to check out some of the other hotels in the area to compare to what we were staying in. The difference was night & day. If you can spend just a little bit more, I would stay at the Holiday Inn Express. It looked clean, the staff was friendly and it was just a short walk to the beach. If you need to stay in the same price range as the San Juan Beach Hotel or want to be closer to the beach, stay at the Sandy Beach Hotel or the Atlantic Beach Hotel. Both of those are cleaner and in a better location. They are right on the beach, in a part where you can actually swim.

The wind off the ocean is fierce and never let up the entire week I was at the hotel - made it hard to read by the pool. Staff uniformly friendly and eager to help. Housekeeping a bit sloppy. Beds were good quality but no mattress covers and the bottom sheets were not fitted but shorty flat sheets so every night I would awake to find I was sleeping on the bare mattress since the bottom sheet would work its way down the bed. Annoying. Stingy with the bars of soap and towels. All that said however its a real bargain to get a Condado hotel for $99/night internet rate ($10 more for ocean view - well worth it). The bus to Old San Juan stops right up the block - 75 cents. Take it instead of the $20 cab ride. Ashford Ave is loaded with restaurants - most good. Nearby La Concha Hotel has a great beach which you can use and can rent chairs from the concessionaire. - in PR all beaches are open to the public. SJBH has no beach access. The door from the pool to thebeach is locked and anyway the beach is very rocky and wouild be dangerous to swim off of. Good casino at La Concha also - its just 5 min walk from the San Juan Beach Hotel. So, save $150/night and stay at San Juan Beach Hotel instead of La Concha.

I picked the hotel because of the location and price. The lobby is real nice it was remodeled and the view is awesome. They have a nice small pool but is a little bit deep for small kids. They have a valet service - $18 dollar daily. If you are a young guy and just want to be in the middle of the night life, walking distance to clubs, restaurants, the real Isla Verde beach and don't mind a motel room. This is the place to stay. If you are looking for a family hotel, with nice rooms and a nice beach go somewhere else.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Bedford, Texas", "Title": "\u201cPlease Read before you book\u201d", "Author": "alexarlinghaus", "ReviewID": "UR71922235", "Content": "I went to Puerto Rico with my swim team for a training camp/vacation, our coach is from Puerto Rico and he assured us that the hotel we were staying at was fantastic. Sadly we were a bit disappointed, The hotels location was FANTASTIC! it is right between two wonderful beaches and right around the nightlife, and tourist shops and American chains such as Subway, Chilis, and Duncan Donuts as well as many local restaurants with native Puerto Rican food, there is a restaurant close to the hotel (left the ocean view restaurant) that has AMAZING food and an unbeatable view. Back to the hotel, while the location may be great the hotel fell a bit flat, at first look it seems to be great but then you notice things like how much of the furniture is broken, the vents are dirty, and the beach is not swimmable. It seemed like it was a very nice hotel but they stopped cleaning after a while. The service was ok, they were helpful when their manager was around but kind of seemed like they pushed our problems to the side. BREAKFAST IS NOT FREE! We were led to believe that the breakfast \"buffet\", which was just little cereal boxes, bread, orange juice, and oatmeal, was free when in all reality it is $5 which is definitely a scam. the other negative thing is the fact that there is a night club in the hotel restaurant which can keep people on the 3rd floor awake at night.

If you're looking for a cheap place to sleep and shower, this is a good find. If you're looking to spend long hours in the hotel itself, this place isn't for you. It's that simple. Pros:: - The rooms were adequate to our needs. There was A/C, TV, shower, good view of the bay. Yes, they are damp - but it is the Caribbean, not Arizona. It's not moldy or dirty - just damp. The only weird thing about the rooms was that our friend booked four of us in two adjacent rooms - their room had an electronic door swipe and our's had a regular lock-and-key. Apparently, they're changing them over one by one - we didn't have a problem with safety or belongings when we were there. - Valet parking. - Great pool area, you can watch the waves from your deck chair. Every night we hung out by the pool until really late and no one bothered us. - Walking distance of great restaurants - we went to a great diner down the street, Chinese restaurant, and a Puerto Rican beachfront restaurant all without having to get our car. Cons: - There's no real \"beachfront\" there - just a sliver of beach, really - but a 5-10 minute walk towards the bridge and you'll find the Marriott beach. - The bar wasn't finished when we were there. It looked really cool, though - bright lights and white floors, very nightclub-y. The stairs had an \"out of order\" sign, which we thought was hilarious. - The area of the city is under construction - this isn't exactly a con because it doesn't look shady or unsafe, but it can be a surprise if you're looking for waving palms and pristine-looking resorts. In short, know what you want - if you've come to Puerto Rico looking for an all-inclusive place to pamper you silly, this ain't it. But if you're with friends or explore the island and the different beaches and need a comfortable place to return to at night, stay at the SJ Beach Resort.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cDecent Place for a night\u201d", "Author": "Pmag85", "ReviewID": "UR67205096", "Content": "Stayed on the 10th floor for one nite prior to a cruise.

From the quality of the lifts to the state of the bedrooms, this hotel is to be avoided at all costs.

This is not true, only the downstairs areas have been done. DO NOT BE CONNED BY THE GLITZY WEBSITE OR THE POOL AREA! (Not one of the chairs or recliners around the pool were complete and servicable). On arrival one is pleasantly surprised at the refit but as soon as the lift doors open on the accommodation floor, you immediately know you have made a big mistake. The coridors are dark and grubby and the fittings date back tonthe 50s. On entering my room, none of the lights worked so I had to wait for several bulbs and plugs to be replaced. The room was dark, damp and electrical fittings would be condemned under UK standards. I booked a Lagoon View .... sounds nice?? The lagoon is a stretch of water the other side of the busy main road and can only be seen as there is a building site/ car park on the oposite side of the road. This should have been described as MainRoad and Skip View!! Then I saw the bathroom... There was black mould on the shower curtains, the bath was dirty and the taps were a health hazard. The bathroom ceiling was even worse, dripping with black spores and mould. Musty smells were from both bathroom and bedroom. Could it get worse???? Yes it could... Below is a nightclub/bar and taxis collecting and dropping people off using their horns thoughout the night was only drowned by the ancient air conditioning. Did this spoil my night's sleep??? No, it couldn't as none of the bolts were fitted to the bed frame so the bed collapsed one side during the night anyway! The promised Breakfast before 10.30 had ran out of juice, coffee and any food by 10.05 though once the other problems were brought to the attention of the hopeless manager, he promised to get me some breakfast.. This was later changed to $4.99 so I could go down the street in the heavy rain for a Breakfast at Subway. Neither materialised so I went without.... thankful for a bottle of water I had left from my long flight the day before. Surely this couldn't get worse??? Yes it could!!! I checked out the hotel at 11am and headed to my Cruise on Royal Caribbean Adventure of the Seas, -- That afternoon my neck and chest broke out into a fungal rash that spoilt the rest of my 2 week holiday sailing the Atlantic to Barcelona and then home to London. I still have patches on my chest that now won't tan over and I need to see a skin specialist. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend...?? Not even to my worse enemy as he could easily sue me for negligence or malice. Avoid -- Avoid -- Avoid. ps...

Once we got to the hotel, they were oversold and had no rooms, the staff was the most unprofessional, useless, unfriendly and all of the above team i have ever came accross in my life.

Mold coming through the ceiling paint, no towels, stained floors, old moldy carpeting, exposed wires, rust covered lamp shades and ceiling edges, no room service, poorly ventelated, foul smell, and best of all blood stained sheet and the different shades of grey towels which once were white. YES blood stained sheets, the pictures are below as proof of what a disgusting place to stay at. This room was obviously not up to parr to accomodate any guest, it was an insult to the mear delicassy of my nature. after discovering the blood stained sheets, i demanded a full refund and to be immidiately checked out. The staff even thretened to call the police on me because i was so upset, this too was funny as my father is a high powered judge in Puerto Rico. After exhausting all resouces they were forced to return our money and check us out of the hotel. I was literally in this hotel for a total of 12 hours and i witnessed 5 other people/groups cheching out and demanding refunds as well because of similar situations. This is not a good reputation this hotel is trailing behind. The trick here is that they have only one floor which is updated and it is the 10th floor, so if you do stay here, make sure that you are accomodated on the 10th floor. this hotel is a disguise, when you arrive , the lobby looks amazing as well as the pool, the bar and the entrance, thats about it. once u get in the elevator ang go up, it all changes.

The service was very attentive from the staff and they now offer room service, which they didn't have on our last stay because they were constructing the restaurant along with the lobby area. The wireless Internet worked perfectly as I was told they've installed a new Wi-Fi Network and the beast part of it... It was free!

Good points: (1) Room had a good ocean view. (2) Large spacious room Bad points: (1) The room lights were not plugged in properly, so we spent some time trying to figure out how to switch on the lights. (2) The batteries in the TV remote were missing, had to ask for new batteries. (3) TV did not come with any channel list/guide. (4) The light inside the bathroom was almost dead (couldn't see a thing), had to ask them to install new lights. (5) The bathroom sink was clogged, had to ask them to unclog it. (6) The beds did not have any warm blankets, had to ask them for it. (7) They had conditioner/shampoo in the bathroom, but not a single bar for hand soap anywhere; had to ask them for it. (8) No one picked up the phone when we tried to call the front desk from our room (several times) to inquire about the above. (9) Had to go down to the front desk several times to get them to do the above. (10) The service provider who fixed the above seemed very casual (old T-shirt, unshaved); he could be made more professional in appearance. He did seem to be a nice guy who was trying and responding to our needs. So the fault is not his. This means that the blame goes to the management for not running the place professionally. (11) No laundry facilities in hotel, and according to them there is no place nearby for laundry. (12) Front desk person didn't seem to be knowledgeable about the immediate area; found this out when we asked for suggestions about local restaurants. Or maybe the person was simply too busy to respond and explain. It seemed that there is just one person in the front desk who is expected to coordinate everything -- and that's humanly impossible for a hotel that is this large. (13) Lamp stands were starting to get rusted. Can see some rust inside the bathroom too. Overall, our room was not ready for guests, even though we checked in late in the evening and that should have given them enough time to set it up. If a hotel's management can be messed up, this is the way to do it. This could make a great case study in a business school --- if anyone wants lessons on how to ignore customers and mess up the management of a hotel, come here for a study tour.

Check-in was fairly simple and went quickly, though the staff did not speak great english (no biggie). We got to our room and opened the door to what seemed like a sauna. The A/C in the room took quite a while (2+ hours) to get cool and the hotel itself has absolutely NO A/C in the common areas. That means a hot, sticky lobby, hallways, lounge, etc. Pretty uncomfortable. By the time we got to our room we were ready to crash - our earlier flight had been canceled and we had been chasing replacement flights from Washington D.C. since 8am (it was now after 11pm). The airlines had also misplaced our luggage so we had absolutely nothing. Wanting to get a shower before bed, my husband went first. I heard a loud crash come from the bathroom and found him with the shower door (which had fallen off the tracks) on the floor. Lovely. Showering without a curtain or a door was certainly a task. The bathroom was absolutely filthy to top that off. The room itself felt so discusting that both of us put our dirty clothes from that day back on just to sleep in because we wouldn't sleep bare in the sheets! But when we finally laid down to rest, the mattress fell out from underneath us and the bed frame broke. We slept with the mattress on the floor.

We booked and paid the San Juan Beach Hotel through Expedia for the period from April 19th to April 29th 2008. After arriving to the hotel the first thing they asked me was to give them my credit card without any explanation. Since all the other people checking in were doing that and since I was tired from the trip I just gave it to them. The room was pretty spacious with an amazing view of the ocean but was old, needed thorough redecorating and most of all had a very strong moldy smell so we had to buy an air freshener immediately. After a few days, on April 22nd when I checked my bank account I noticed that the hotel had taken 250$ off my card without notifying me and without my authorization. When I asked the front desk what was the meaning of that they said that it was just a security deposit and that it will be returned to me 48 hours after checking out. I protested for not being notified about that but just wanted to continue my vacation. When I checked out at noon on April 29th they wanted to charge me for parking but I protested strongly to the manager since I had no car so they removed that charge and my balance due was 0$. On May 1st, after I`d returned to Colorado I found out that instead of my 250$ deposit being returned to me another 250$ were taken off my card by the San Juan Beach Hotel without notifying me and without my authorization!!! When I called them they said they charged me for smoking in the room which is outrageous because they have smoke detectors so any smoke would trigger an alarm and I am not insane to smoke in a smoke-free area! Apparently they just made up an excuse to take extra money from me! Now I am trying to get my 500$ back through the law system and I had to cancel my card so the hotel could not steal any more money from me.

Also, if you plan to spend your entire trip in your hotel room you may want to consider looking elsewhere.

There are many hotels much closesr to the airport. Second, the lobby is the cleanest/best kept of the hotel. Beware of pics of only the lobby. It is very deceiving.

The room was at least 30 dollars cheaper than the lowest priceI I had so far encountered so was surely worth roughing it a bit. It is an older hotel in some disrepair but as the new, energetic American manager told me they are now preparing for a major renovation. The room was enormous and spotlessly clean. The only thing threadworn was the carpet and some plaster around the EXCELLENT air conditioner but I can live with that. There was a new iron and ironing board and a new hair dryer in the bathroom. They have many channels on the nice television. My sheets and the two large beds for ONE person were clean. They also gave me no hassle whatsoever about having several friends up to visit in my room. Most hotels in San Juan will allow no one to go up to you room and look at you like you are trying to do something immoral. The pool is open 24 hours! I have never seen that offered in my life not even at the Acapulco Princess or the swankiest resorts. That business of not being allowed to swim after 7 or 8 PM is stuoid and for the birds. Near the medium sized CLEAN pool is an access to the beach. The Atlantic ocean around Condado is great for tanning but not a good beach for swimming. It is rough water and quite rocky. There is a high speed computer in the hallway with free intenet for the guests and it was upgraded the day I arrived with a new optical keyboard and mouse. Internet is almost IMPOSSIBLE to find in Puerto Rico. I could not imagine that! Their sarcastic reply all over the island is that everyone has internet and there is no need for internet cafes. Well most of the populace looks like they don't even have shoes let alone a computer with internet access! The only other I found was a very friendly,nice internet cafe that charges 7 dollars and hour in front of the Marriot about 8 blocks up the avenue and open till 11 PM and a somewhat shabby place in front of the cruise ship terminal that has limited hours opening at 2 PM till 6 PM. I found NO internet on the rest of the island and I searched everywhere. There is free ice and a snack vending room plus a restaurant and full bar. The food looked delicious even though I did not actually have a meal there. Most important to me was the friendliness of the young ladies and gents at the desk and the manager who would do anything to please. All the other places I visited on practically the entire island they were primarily obnoxious and could care less if you stayed with them or not and the rooms are outrageous in price everywhere. If you don't mind a place that has seen better days but appears to soon be on the upswing I do suggest this place. Just to have friendly people welcome you and help you with cabs and sightseeing is worth the price alone. Abouth three blocks from this hotel is Charlies Auto Rental which is EXCELLENT.

We rented a car and we weren't told until be got to the hotel that there is a $17 dollar a day charge for valet service. This really isn't bad compared to the cost of taking a taxi ride but if we were told this up front we would have at least expected it. Also, during check in we were told that they needed credit cards for both rooms in case we used room service or went to the bar. Again, this really isn't a problem and I understand hotels do this often (especially when you pay for your trip up front) but this information was not stated up front during the booking process. When we asked the front desk people to explain the need for the credit card numbers they weren't the friendliest. It took another worker to come to our assistance and explain in detail the need for the credit cards (which weren't charged). I have never been to Puerto Rico and as a first time tourist I had a couple of places in mind that I wanted to visit. The hotel did provide a little information about these places but they had pre packed tours they recommended that cost between $50 and $150 dollars. Luckily, we heard another hotel guest complaining about her tour (which she didn't finish) and decided to look into other ativities of our own. The Bacardi tour, which they priced at around $50 each, only cost us about $25 dollars total. This includes the parking garage fee, the fee for the ferry and the cab ride too and from the plant (which was a great experience). The hotel also had certain restaurants they recommended. The first night we went to one of the right down the road from the hotel, the food was okay but if you want to impress your guest, you have to do better. The second night we went to another recommended hotel, which ended up being a horrible experience! Finally, on the third day we decided to go on the internet (it is free for all hotel guest) and find attractions and restaurants on our own. The hotel was not the cleanist but I expected this due to reviews I read before my trip. We didn't spend much time in our room anyway so that wasn't one of my concerns. The main advise I want to share is do your own research, rent a car and get directions from the internet (not the locals)!

This time my $99 per night on Priceline landed me the San Juan Beach Hotel which they actually call a three star rating. After getting the hotel, I looked at the reviews on this hotel and became quite concerned with all of the bad publicity it has received. I then contacted Priceline and told them that I wanted the opportunity to change hotels based on the bad reviews it had received..They emphatically said \"NO\" and that they felt that their rating as a fair assessment of this hotel. Since it was on my credit card, I had no choice but to go. When I arrived at 7:00 pm my room was not ready. I was told to wait in the lobby of the hotel. About 30 minutes later my room was ready. I was surprised that the housekeepers were still working this late. The view from the room was incredible as I was looking right directly out from the ocean. The room itself was not very clean. The carpet was still dirty, the bedspread had holes in it, the lamp shades were completed burned and the bathroom had quite a bid of mold on the ceiling and the shower curtain. Twice we were not replenished with any towels. Had to go to the front desk and were informed that they were out of towels at that point and had to wait until they washed the old ones. Pool area and view from the pool were quite nice and the gentleman that works the bar was quite entertaining and did whatever he could to make your stay good while acknolwedging that the hotel had a lot of work to be done but told us that it was under new managmement and would get better soon. (that didn't do me any good) When I checked out I had things on my bill that I never paid for like Valet Car and telephone charges. They took them off my bill, but had no idea how they got there. I do have to say that everyone in the hotel was extremely nice and seemed to acknowledge that the hotel has had many issues. My biggest issue is with Priceline because I feel that they deceived me in calling this a 3 star hotel. If I wanted a one star hotel and I stayed here then I would not be disappointed. I sent a note to Priceline after my stay and told them everything but they had no interest in what I had to stay and once again said that this meets their standard for a 2.5 Star Hotel (Funny that they were now calling this a 2.5 Star Hotel). Guess they rounded up to 3 instead of down to 2. In any case, I blame Priceline more than the hotel because I would have never booked this hotel based on the comments from the readers. Everything that everyone says about this hotel is mostly true. You get what you pay for.

We left the hotel for the day and came back that evening to the most disgusting room ever. I walked in and noticed that the mirror was wet. I mentioned it to my friend, wondering if the maid had forgotten to wipe it down after spraying it. My friend realized that it seemed to be covered in a dew. She went to pick up a travel guide from the bed, and it was damp. Then I picked up a sweater I had left in the room -- it was also damp. The furniture in the room was wet (refer to pics), the bed was wet, the mirror was wet, all the clothing we had hung up was wet, and the walls were wet (refer to pics). We look up, and there is disgusting black mildew COVERING the ceiling. The air in the room was so thick and humid you could barely breathe after a few minutes. We went to the front desk, who refused to refund us our money so we could change hotels, and were switched to another room on the 8th floor. We get in the new room and can breathe, thankfully. However, there is no LOCK on the door (refer to pics)! We pull back our beds and are in for new surprises. My bed has a blanket but no top sheet. My friend's bed has a top sheet but no blanket!

I took a look at the Holiday Inn Express website and their San Juan hotel right down the street (also in Condado) does not have this service fee. We took a look at the HI Express while we were in town and the pool is smaller than the SJB's, but that seemed to be the only drawback. And the SJB's pool got cloudier by the day, as they seemed to not be caring for it at all. We had to switch rooms after the 1st night because our TV didn't work and you couldn't adjust the temperature on the bathroom faucet. Our new room was only marginally better. And there was one day we came back to no room cleaning after being out of the room the entire day (9-5). At that point we just asked for clean towels for our shower when they offered to clean it for us then. The only food available in the hotel was a continental breakfast for a ridiculous $7+tax. The spread wasn't impressive from the looks of it and I could just grab a better breakfast from a local place for much cheaper.
