The room was very clean and comfortable, the most important parts. It does not have an elevator, and some of the rooms are smaller than others which I am more than OK with for a 2 star hotel and really good price.

The hotel was just as close to the Champs de Mars Metro station, but the station was also in a creepy area, so take a 10 minute walk to the busy Berri-Uqam Metro Station where three metro lines intersect. There was housekeeping everyday and the bathroom was clean. Toiletries were fine - Pantene samples and generic soaps. The staff is also very pleasant. We booked a Grey Line tour and, knowing we would miss breakfast, they packed a bagel with packets of cream cheese and jam, and a bottle of orange juice for us. The complimentary breakfast was also nice - there are maybe 5 choices and if memory serves, the best ones were the toast, bacon, eggs, fruit, tea/coffee, juice choice or the french toast, hash brown (like french fry cubes), fruit, tea/coffee and juice choice. Fruit consisted of a slice of orange, a quarter of a banana and a slice of melon. Negatives: The hotel is yellowishly lit, and you need a key for the front door of the hotel after 10 or 11 p.m., a key to enter the stairwell (as there is no elevator - the stairwell is also dim, has creeky carpeted stairs and smelled like body odor) and your room key. They give you only one set of keys, so it will be a pain if you or your traveling companion are not attached at the hip and one of you does not have the keys and needs to get into the stairwell to get to your room. The rooms are small. We first had a two-single-beds room but there was barely enough room between the bed and the walls, and the room was dimly lit and dilapidated. There was dark flowered wallpaper, old furniture, no closet to hang your clothes, a small bathroom with one shelf to put your toiletries, and an 11\" TV mounted on a stand above the bed. Again, this room barely had room for one to walk. I thought that the reviews on this site about the size of the rooms were exaggerated until I saw it for myself. The noise of the heating/air conditioning system roared so much that we could even hear it through our ear plugs and after a terrible night of no sleep, had to ask to be changed. I am in my 30s. I think this place would be fine for nomadic college kids, but not at my ripe old age when bright lighting and no body odor become mandatory requirements. After a long day, I did not look forward to returning to the hotel, which is unfortunate because I thought that the staff and the owner of the hotel were very pleasant. Tip: Do not stay in a room near the stairwell. The sound of people going up and down the stairs amplifies to an elephant stampede - I am not kidding. And the walls are so paper thin that voices from people talking in the hallway at a normal level will jolt you awake. Tip: Get a room on the \"first\" floor, which is the nearest floor to the lobby. I am accustomed and enjoy climbing stairs, but it is not a pleasure to walk up and down literally fifty steep steps in a dim smelly stairwell everytime you need to go to your room to get something you forgot, or trudge up there after a long, tiring day of sightseeing. Tip: Do not ask the \"concierge\" to book you a Grey Line tour, as she will add a $12 \"hotel fee\" to do so without advance warning nor your consent. She added the $12 AFTER she booked the tour for us and it was too late to complain since the service was already done.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ottawa, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGood Value - Great Location\u201d", "Author": "Anne P", "ReviewID": "UR121181132", "Content": "The room was a bit small yet it was clean and the bed was comfortable.

But once we saw the entrance (decor tacky and dingy) and especially our room, we knew the price could have been even lower: The room was very basic: worn out bed, one lonely wooden chair, mirror, desk, closet = bare components of the room and everything looked like it was salvaged from some dorm room 50 years ago. It smelled like old wood: not antique or charming: just plain old! Our view was looking into some back yard of a neighbouring house, the bathroom was plain, sterile and cold. Realistically we didn't even want to stay in the room, but it would have been nice to not feel like you want to leave it. Once again, if your main plan is to explore the beautiful streets of old Montreal, you may not care much about the room, and can stay at this hotel.

They even charged us $3.50 for half of a small pitcher of ice because there was no mini fridge in our room and no plug to fill up the sink with cold water to keep our drinks cool. This small thing seems to be a reoccurring theme. The price was high since it was the May 24 weekend-$74 including tax. A few weeks ago I spent $55 including tax for a hotel up the road in a huge room, minifridge, big mirrors, big desk, big comfy bed.

The Price. At $60, it is hard to go wrong.... but they must have tried their hardest. 2. The Cleanliness. It wasn't bad. It is hard to keep a place like this clean, I'm sure. 3. The historic significance/Location. It was in Old Quebec, and was 270ish years old. My recommendations: I think it is important that you know exactly what you are going to get before you arrive. It isn't good. If you are cheap, and don't care if you have any fun, this is the place for you. Here is what the room was like: We entered the main lobby, and got our keys. We went up the stairs to our room, and opened the door, which only opened 3/4 of the way, due to an angled wall which was placed behind the door. The room was painted a kind of greeny brown colour... almost baby-poop-like, with the windows, doors and ceiling painted royal purple. The bed was a super-single - MAYBE a double, but that would be pushing it. All of the furnishings appeared to be picked up at a Good Will, as they were all mismatched and well worn in. The television was a 13\" which was placed in the upper right corner of the room. The bathroom wasn't horrible. It was all white, I think recently renovated. Although the toilet seat was a little bit stained brown, which isn't that appealing to sit on. Additionally, we came to the hotel in the winter, so it was quite blizzardy outside. While this might be an excellent location for the summer months, within walking distance to the port and Old Montreal, in the winter, it kind of sucks. You can't really walk to anything, and must rely on the Metro or taxis to get anywhere in the city. They truly could fix this place up and make it much nicer if they combined some of the rooms, and had a real interior decorator come in and redesign the look of the rooms. Since it is a historic site, they could have made it much more classic inside, instead of making it look WORSE than many of the youth hostels I have stayed in. Good luck!

When we asked about the deposit he just said it was nothing to do with them. The place is pretty crappy it is very small and there is no lift so if you have heavy baggage be ready to cart it up a narrow circular stairwell. The room seemed reasonably clean - bathroom was good, carpet not so much, beds passed the bed bug test - however, we got a nice little surprise when we found some rather large black hairs in our beds including those little curly ones you really would rather NOT have to experience finding in your bed. EW! Upon checkout we went to rebook a night as we were pushed for time and didn't have the time to look for something better - the lady at the desk informed us the room would cost $200 as it was a saturday night!!! I'm sorry but they were pushing it even charging $100, but $200 is just an absolute joke. So we booked at the Holiday Inn at the airport instead which for an additional thirty dollars was a HUGE improvement. Staff were a bit rude and also nagged us for a tip which made things very awkward and my friend simply retorted we would not be giving a tip as we did not appreciate the giant black hairs in our beds.... hahaha. I'm not one of those finicky nagging types and I've stayed in many hostels/budget accommodation etc this one was average but simply put just overpriced for what it was.

I was immediatly charged 25% of the total as a non refundable deposit as per the hotel policy. I was happy to do so to secure the room. In February plans changed and I needed to cancel one of the nights. I was prepared to eat the 25% deposit on that night as I had agreed to those terms. I sent an email to the hotel via their web-page with this request. I waited for about 3 weeks and got no response. I callled the hotel and was unable to communicate in my broken French with the lady who answered. I called back and used my French speaking friend to translate. We spoke to the manager and he agreed to cancel the night but that I would have to pay the 25% which was fine with me. He left me a message on my voicemail confirming this agreement. When I arrived at the hotel to check in there was no reservation under my name. I had my copy of the booking confirmation email that showed the initial booking of 5 days. The lady at the desk said that I was deemed a \"no show\" for the previous night which is the one that I had cancelled months earlier. I told her that I had cancelled and that the manager was aware. I was given a room but charged 100% for all five nights. I complained and was told that I would have to speak to the manager in the morning. I went up to my room and could not BELIEVE that I had just paid for such a dirty, small and smelly room. The carpet was filthy, the furniture was broken and the places smelled of recent extermination chemicals. The bathroom was marginally better but was extremely dark and dingy. It was also very loud and not condusive to sleeping without earplugs. On the second morning I could hear a persistent scratching coming from the ventilation gate. I got up on my bed to look and observed the rear end and tail of a rat scurrying away. The rat made only that one appearance and I don't think it left the ventilation and got in the room. Later in the week I met with the manager. He denied ever talking to me even tho I had written his name at the time and that there was a phone message on my machine from him! He told me that I was LUCKY that he decided to give me the room as my \"no show\" on the first night cost him hundreds of dollars has he could have rented the room for more. I kept reminding him that I had paid in full and that I (along with him) had cancelled that night per his hotel policy more than three months ago paying the 25% penalty. He eventually gave me $50 back which is about half of what I should have gotten. It was very frustrating as he knew I was stuck and used that as leverage. I asked to cancel the entire reservation and he said that I would get no refund for the entire 5 nights! He was EXTREMELY RUDE and blamed everything on me. The icing on the cake so to speak was the last day. I asked how to get to the airport bus. The manager said he could sell me tickets and book that bus for me and I agreed thinking that he was trying to make up for all the other hassles. I was wrong. He arranged the free shuttle bus to pick me up and sold me a ticket for $16 for the airport bus. When I got to the bus station I was advised that the ticket I had was FRADULANT and INVALID. I had no time to return to the hotel to complain and was forced to buy another ticket so I didn't miss my flight. Needless to say I warn anyone who stays at CHAMPS DE MARS that the owner is a scam artist.

What I wasn't prepared for was: 1) the dried chewing gum on the carpet by my bed when I arrived (yuk!

I understand why it was so cheap now! After getting a little nervous at the contradictory Trip Advisor reviews, I decided to cancel my reservation 2 weeks prior to my trip. Unfortunately according to their policies, there is a 25% fee of your entire bill (for all the nights you would stay) that is non-refundable. It is 100% non-refundable if you cancel within 48 hours. (I should have been a little suspicious already of a hotel with such policies!) Anyways, with 2 weeks in hand, I wrote an email to the hotel to cancel, deciding to suck up the 25% cancellation fee. They wrote me back (which CONFIRMED they received my email) offering me a special deal to come. I declined in a subsequent email, to which they never replied. At this point, I got a tad worried since I didn't want the full amount charged to my credit card, and called to cancel. I had to call twice, because the first time, the receptionist told me that she was unable to cancel the reservation and that I would have to contact the head office, to which she didn't have the number. UMMMM WHAT?? I'm quite sure that this little hotel has no head office, to which she strangely could not connect me to.

He refused to even look an address up for me on the reception's computer that was connected to internet. He was extremely rude. This he was in front of other guests his staff and his family members. On arrival, he took extra deposit of 100 dollars from me cash on the side although I had paid deposit of USD 92.37 through my card via internet initially and also paid for the Hotel in cash on arrival in advance. Even though I was extremely tired after my journey I sensed that something was wrong & I reacted to it after I went up to the room and realising that he did not include that CAD100 in the receipt that he gave me, I came back from the room and told him to give me a receipt for the 100 CAD as deposit too. He arrognatly said that He sometimes charged a deposit of 500CAD etc. and no receipt was needed for that, and if I wanted to stay there I had to follow HIS rules and I should be grateful that he took only CAD100. I demanded a receipt and on insistence he magnanimously wrote on the paper that he had given me earlier \"deposit $100\" cash. Later on he denied that I had given him extra deposit of 100 dollars, and refused to pay it back, but after several heated arguments and a long chat with his staff, who seemed to be very much afraid to tell him that I was right (hence she would lose her job) and on presentation of the paper he had angriy signed, and on which he had written \u00e2\u20ac\u0153$100 Deposit\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, and probably realising that he was wrong, I got (at last) that deposit back too when I checked out On 18th. Intially he did not want to pay it back and told me to be satisfied with refund of the 88CAD = 92.37 USD that I had remitted through my card on the day I booked, or leave that too. I perceived it as him telling me to \"just get lost\". It was very insulting and humiliating and I really felt extremely sad & cheated and I told that to one of his staff and she promised to talk with him after which (as I mentioned earlier) it seemed that he realised what he had done. It is very sad. Info about internet (that there was internet connection in every room) given to me by this man on the phone when I phoned from Sweden did not turn out to be correct at all. He had also told me that I did not need to a laptop with me since they had one in their cafe for guests to use. The other staff and his wife were extremely nice to me, but alas, I had to leave the Hotel because it would have culminated in a bigger row and I felt horrible and sick because of the atmosphere that this man created for me. He seemed to have some selected customers with whom he was very much buddy buddy as soon as they appeared. Moreover, the rooms were very small, the water in the washroom very much fluctuating from luke warm to very cold. Nowhere to hang clothes, apart from some hooks, although I got some hangers on requesting for them. One could hear doors banging and floorboards screeching on every arrival of guests late at night, walking. One could hear the guest in neighbouring rooms talking very clearly nd also when they were engaged in acts of lovemaking which was a quite uncomfortable & disturbing. I do not wish to make more comments on that at this stage. I would class this place as under -1 star hotel.

Several choices too, and the waitres did not charge us more for ordering extra bacon - a generous touch. 3. A fairly comfortabe - although a slightly worn - ambiece that may put some off, yet apeal to pothers due to its inherent quirkiness and charm. Now, I noticed a few posts which mentioned the rooms being too small - I did not find this was the case with our room. Well, our room was well-sized and while the facilities were certainly not what you would find in a Hilton, the room did have a certain charm about it. 4. A polite, homely and helpful staff, including the proprietor. 5. Well priced. I did not shop around too much, so I really cant say if this is much less expensive than the competition, but based on my limited search, it seemed to be near the bottom of the price list in the old Montreal area. Now the bad: 1. There is no elevator. The stairs are steep and if you are coming back to your room after a hard day's sightseeing, you crtainy dont want to climb 3 setsof stairs, do you? Take a room on the ground or first floor, or dont bother with this hotel. 2. There was no bright light in the room. Not good for someone who wants to read. Having said that, there were three lamps. 3. I did not notice any parking on the premises. 4. The dinner menu in the restaurant is quite limited and expensive for its class, the 'house beer' is just ok and quite expensive, and the bar closes at 11 pm. 5. The neighbourhood seems to be a mix of upmarket housing and outright poverty / drug abuse. I noticed at least 40 or so homeless people in the vicinity of the hotel. I feel sorry for these people, and will be honest - at no time were they threatening or troublesome. Its just that when one is on a vacation, one tends to want to avoid having to come across these unfortunate people who are obviously in such a shameful state due to their chemical dependency. So, they are probably more a 'visual encumbrance' than a safety hazard.

It was all going to plan until we arrived at our hotel Champ De Mar (a term which should be used extremely loosely when describing it) in Montreal. I searched online and via the Montreal Tourism website and wanted to stay in or near Old Montreal. After reading several hotel descriptions, The Champ De Mar Hotel caught my attention, describing itself with a European atmosphere and having been renovated a few years ago, seemed to be ideal. The hotel online photos seemed to support their description. I've attached photo's as they'll save many thousands words. Our stay went from bad to worse to worst to absolutely terrible. The 2 1/2 star rating not-with-standing, I don't know or understand how this hotel is rated as such, because it is not a hotel and more a hostel. I've stayed in motels with that were much friendlier, cleaner and spacious. The online hotel description is grossly overstated and absolutely misleading and the photo's are certainly well positioned to hide the true nature of this place. Don't be fooled. Location: ** Your not centrally located within Old Montreal, in fact the hotel is on the absolute eastern outskirts of the Old Port and certainly not part of the Old Montreal scene and atmosphere. Reception and Service: ** Front desk closes at 11pm. I checked in after 10pm and the front doors were locked, having to wait for the attendant to finally see me and open the door to let me in. ** Once I began the check in process, the attendant advised me that I had to pay for my two day stay in advance with no refund. I discovered the \"why\" within minutes. I found the staff stereotypically French and very indifferent considering we're visitors to the city. Fortunately, our service experience outside the hotel was very very different. Parking: ** There is no parking at the hotel. You must park your car almost two blocks away in a public parking at $15.00 per day and more should you used your car during you stay in Montreal. The walk to the hotel at night is uncomfortable because the street is poorly lit and not part of the well populated tourist area of Old Montreal. Ladies beware. No Elevator: ** Should you decided to experience for yourself this hotel, pick a lower floor which to stay. To get to your room you need to use a dark and smelly stairwell that will barely fits yourself with your luggage. And should you encounter someone coming in the opposite direction, there's not enough room someone must back up. Cleanliness: ** Generally, it should be much much better. Read on. Bathroom: ** See attached photos. It's small with the basic 3 pieces. We used the plastic cups because they were individually wrapped, otherwise we were very careful to touch as little as possible. Our Room: ** See attached photos. Small is the only adjective I'll use. We had a double bed and only space enough to walk down one side. ** Do not expect to get a good night sleep. The mattress and pillows are the poorest quality and the furniture are not antiques, rather someone else garbage. The room is small with sealed windows and therefore no air circulation and extremely stuffy and smelly of body odor. ** There is no-where to hang up your clothes and never the less decided to keep all our clothes in our suitcases.... explanation to come, read on. ** The walls are paper thin and you can hear EVERYTHING, especially if you're lucky to find yourself near the stairwell. We were fortunate (not) to be booked beside a room that had same children and it seemed we were all in the same room. ** The now for the best, if your able to get through all the above, that is, cramped quarters, poor mattress and pillows, stuffy and smelly enclosed room and able to close your eyes and fall asleep (more from exhaustion) then in the morning you'll find dozens of BED BUG BITE welts all over your body. Although my girlfriend and I wore our clothing to bed, not sleepware, our cloths, my girlfriend had dozens of bites over her arms, feet and torso where her sweater rode up in bed, including six on her face. Now ladies and gentlemen, how romantic do you think she felt?? Again, stay away from this place. Breakfast: ** Our stay included breakfast which is the only minutely good thing I can write about, with you choice of bacon and eggs, french toast and pancakes (Aunt Jemina). ** If you expecting Bistro and epicurean cuisine as described in there brochure, then if my aunt had wheels she'd be a wagon. Many many many better places to have breakfast with much more atmosphere. Renovations: ** Just looking at the quality of the materials and workmanship; I would guess the material probably came from demolition sites and the workmanship came from summer teenage students with no painting, ceramic or construction knowlegde and the furniture and mattresses from garage sales. Our Escape for Peace of Mind: ** For our second night we stayed at the Delta for about $20.00 less than I had already paid for at the Champ De Mar. I suggest anyone who is reading this review (and the others attached) do the same. The Champ De Mar Hotel is better and should more accurately be described as the \"Night De Mare Hotel\". And should you decided to ignore not only my experience but the rest of the reviews on Trip Advisor, then best wishes and after your experience is over..... we all tried to warn you and we told you so. Besides, if you want to experience this type of adventure, then I suggest camping, you'll have more room in a tent, plenty of fresh air and you'll be prepared for bug bites with deet. ***** The Bad ***** Finding \"Hotel Night De Mare\" ***** The Worse ***** Staying at \"Hotel Night De Mare ***** The Worst ***** You actually pay premium dollars for your stay at the Hotel Night De Mare. ***** The Terrible ***** The time you'll have, if you planned a romantic getaway with that special and significant other in your life and expect any sort of \"amore ce soir\" in the \"Hotel Night De Mare\". It will not happen ladies or gentlemen!! ***** The Stupid ***** It's me, for not having consulted Trip Advisor prior to booking the \"Hotel Night De Mare\". Having now read the past \"victims\" reviews would have saved much grief in so many ways. My girlfriend still has the welts from the bed bug bites to remind me of our romantic getaway at the \"Hotel Night De Mare\". Now, you've all now been advised and duly warned.

The hotel was just as close to the Champs de Mars Metro station, but the station was also in a creepy area, so take a 10 minute walk to the busy Berri-Uqam Metro Station where three metro lines intersect. There was housekeeping everyday and the bathroom was clean. Toiletries were fine - Pantene samples and generic soaps. The staff is also very pleasant. We booked a Grey Line tour and, knowing we would miss breakfast, they packed a bagel with packets of cream cheese and jam, and a bottle of orange juice for us. The complimentary breakfast was also nice - there are maybe 5 choices and if memory serves, the best ones were the toast, bacon, eggs, fruit, tea/coffee, juice choice or the french toast, hash brown (like french fry cubes), fruit, tea/coffee and juice choice. Fruit consisted of a slice of orange, a quarter of a banana and a slice of melon. Negatives: The hotel is yellowishly lit, and you need a key for the front door of the hotel after 10 or 11 p.m., a key to enter the stairwell (as there is no elevator - the stairwell is also dim, has creeky carpeted stairs and smelled like body odor) and your room key. They give you only one set of keys, so it will be a pain if you or your traveling companion are not attached at the hip and one of you does not have the keys and needs to get into the stairwell to get to your room. The rooms are small. We first had a two-single-beds room but there was barely enough room between the bed and the walls, and the room was dimly lit and dilapidated. There was dark flowered wallpaper, old furniture, no closet to hang your clothes, a small bathroom with one shelf to put your toiletries, and an 11\" TV mounted on a stand above the bed. Again, this room barely had room for one to walk. I thought that the reviews on this site about the size of the rooms were exaggerated until I saw it for myself. The noise of the heating/air conditioning system roared so much that we could even hear it through our ear plugs and after a terrible night of no sleep, had to ask to be changed. I am 30 years old. I think this place would be PERFECT for the college-aged, but not at my ripe old age when bright lighting and no body odor become mandatory requirements. After a long day, I did not look forward to returning to the hotel, which is unfortunate because I thought that the staff and the owner of the hotel were very pleasant. Tip: Do not stay in a room near the stairwell. The sound of people going up and down the stairs amplifies to an elephant stampede - I am not kidding. And the walls are so paper thin that voices from people talking in the hallway at a normal level will jolt you awake. Tip: Get a room on the \"first\" floor, which is the nearest floor to the lobby. I am accustomed and enjoy climbing stairs, but it is not a pleasure to walk up and down literally fifty steep steps in a dim smelly stairwell everytime you need to go to your room to get something you forgot, or trudge up there after a long, tiring day of sightseeing. Tip: Do not ask the \"concierge\" to book you a Grey Line tour, as she will add a $12 \"hotel fee\" to do so without advance warning nor your consent. She added the $12 AFTER she booked the tour for us and it was too late to complain since the service was already done.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cGood hotel but beware!\u201d", "Author": "Rick2046", "ReviewID": "UR5068841", "Content": "The hotel is nicely located and priced correctly at about $80 per night. The hotel staff is very nice and friendly and the included breakfast is great. It is indeed walking distance from le vieux port but far from many other worthwhile places in Montreal but Montreal has very good public transportation if you do not have a car. Parking around the hotel is very scarce. The hotel internet descriptions claim that it is air conditionned. That is not exactly true. You cannot control the temperature of your own room. I think the temprerature is set for the whole hotel and for me it was too hot most of the time. There is no elevator and I have not seen any staff assistance offered for heavy luggage. The rooms are all upstairs so you have to be able to handle a three story climb if you are on the top floor. You are given three keys (not the magnetic card keys, the old fashion metal keys). one to open the main door, one for the stairway to the rooms, and one for your own room. There is a charge of $50 if you lose them. There is a charge of about $1.50 for local calls from your room and internet is only available in the lobby, not in your room. The reception closes at night at 11 pm you cannot receive any phone calls after that time. The rooms are very small and have no closets or armoires to hang clothes. There are two hooks on a wall for that purpose and a very small chest of drawers. There are no desks. Just a small wall table about 18 inches wide. There are no ice machines but tap water in Montreal has a good taste and is normally cold enough. If you are in Montreal to visit and will only sleep in the room, you will probably be fine with this hotel. I expected to do some work on my laptop there and it was very difficult for me. Overall, do not expect to find the normal amenities found in every hotel room even in a motel 6 in the US. Internet bookings are non refundable so once you are there, you are stuck.

Staff is very friendly, too.", "Date": "May 14, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "College Park, MD", "Title": "\u201cGood Economy Hotel\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4736036", "Content": "I think many of the negative reviews of this hotel were generated by people expecting a Marriot for the price of a Motel 6. For what my friend and I paid, we felt the hotel was more than satisfactory. Our room was quite small, but certainly adequate for sleeping, dressing, and watching a little TV between site-seeing trips. The furniture in the room besides the bed was quite sparse (a simple wooden chair, small dresser, and night stand) but it served its purpose. Our room did not smell or appear dirty and the plumbing worked fine, as did the cable TV. Considering the large, included breakfast and the conveinent 5-minute walk to the Champ-de-Mars metro station, it is a decent value. My only complaint was that the hotel bar was kind of expensive and closed rather early (11pm). I would recomend this hotel especially to students, young people, or anyone looking to enjoy Montreal on a low budget for a few days and who doesn't mind forgoing a few frills.", "Date": "March 26, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "1.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Calgary, Alberta", "Title": "\u201cStay away and watch yourself\u201d", "Author": "rgoldberg", "ReviewID": "UR4045611", "Content": "Just returned from Montreal, stayed in Champ-de-Mar. The location of the hotel is good, a few steps from Old Montreal. The second good thing is breakfast. All the other things are terrible. The rooms are small (that's OK) and extremely smelly with the strong smell of cheap odorizer. Air condition was hardly felt. And you can't open the window!!! The window is closed forever. I was unable to stay in the room more then 20 minutes. On reception I was told that windows are closed for security reasons. It was impossible to cancel the reservation because of cancellation fee of 100%. Interestingly, for additional 70$ I was given a room with a small window amenable to opening (probably the security situation in this room was different).

Also, we discovered that it was a 4 story walk-up (this is not mentioned on their web site). When we requested a different room we were given a larger, but still dirty room on the 4th floor, and were told that we would have to change rooms the next day. The next morning (9:00 A.M.), we took our luggage (no hotel staff to do this) down to the desk, left it there, and were told to return later in the day. We returned at approximately 1:00 P.M. and were told what room to go to, but that we would have to move (again) the next day. All things considered, we decided to check out and take our chances elsewhere. The desk clerk was not helpful, and after fooling with the computer for 5 or 10 minutes, wandered off the the restaurant for coffee. After waiting about 30 minutes, I went into the restaurant and asked for a receipt of the transaction. She (reluctantly) printed the receipt, stating she didn't know I wanted one. Once I got the receipt, I immediately noticed that they were charging us for an extra night! When I requested the bill be recalculated deleting the erroneous charge, she responded that the computer automatically added the night after a certain time and she could not change it. I'm still trying to get the credit.", "Date": "October 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chichester, UK", "Title": "\u201cDon't stay here\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4028417", "Content": "Good location but very poor rooms.
