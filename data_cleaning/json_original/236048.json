(Please note that the directions on the website leading you to the Valeriusplein stop are inaccurate, don't get off there unless you feel like doing some walking!) Our double room was on the small side, but that is to be expected in Amsterdam, and it was never uncomfortable. The room was kept very clean and we had a window with a lovely view outside and a good sized closet. The water was always hot and there was a coffeemaker included in the room (although we never used it). Also included was a hair dryer, other reviews said that you could use it at a charge, but that must have changed recently. Breakfast and wifi were not included, but I signed up for wifi access thru KPN for about \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 for a week.

The room we got was nice, it had three windows, but no balconies (which was a bit of an issue since my boyfriend needed somewhere to smoke). The room was very warm and cozy and perfect for hanging out after our long walks in the cold. It had a nice king size bed and a small sitting area. The decoration made the room look like more than 3 stars. The only issue for us was the bathroom door. The bathroom itself was quite nice-it even had a bathtub and everthing looked perfectly clean. But the door was the sliding type and it didn't exactly close-it just covered the opening. You could basically flap it open if you pushed it from the bottom. So with minimum coverage it was kind of uncomfortable using he bathroom-but we found ways around that (like turning on the TV). It wasn't that bad in the end. We didn't end up trying the breakfast, because we discovered a supermarket 5 minutes from the hotel, called Albert Heijn. It's a local branch. We found everthing we could possibly need for breakfast and lunch. It had sandwiches of all sorts and sizes, croissants, cinnamon rolls, cakes, bagels and all sorts of breads, pre-cut cheese and ham, pre-cut fruit and huge selection of juices. The hotel breakfast is 7.50 euros per person. We almost payed that much only on one day when we got way more than we managed to eat. So I would say try this grocery store!!! The hotel staff are helpful, and especially this one girl who speaks perfect american. She helped us get rid of the extra fee from paying with a credit card, she was very willing to help no matter what we needed (she even searched the internet to find us the type of restaurant we were looking for when she didn't know herself).

It is situated on the ground floor with a view of a path. These are the basic complaints: * the electrics were dangerous, coming away from the wall with intermittent current!! * the bathroom (which was thankfully clean and ok) had a sliding door that had no bottom runner so could be pushed up like a cat flap and no lock! You also could not open this door if someone wanted to use the door going out of the room. * Doors seem to be a theme in this room, as the wardrobe could only be opened by pushing a finger into the keyhole, no handle! * The beds were twin beds as there was no way a double would have fitted. One bed had no light, the other no sidetable. The blankets looked quite grubby, thankfully the duvet and pillows were clean. Unfortunately the mattress was so lumpy that it was the worst night's sleep I have experienced in a hotel. * The carpet was badly stained. The decor dark and grubby. * This hotel boasts the facilities of tea and coffee making facilities but when we asked for a small jug of milk, were told at first that \"we do not give away milk\" before it was produced.A really nasty guy on duty in the evening but the morning employee was really helpful. It just goes to show how the staff can make or break your evaluation, but even the morning guy couldn't redeem the above \"features\"! * The hairdrier had to be collected from the reception for a 20e deposit. Quite what they thought we would have done with a 2 pin hairdrier in the UK I don't know. I just hate all the little charges such as storing your luggage for the day at 3e per suitcase.

As we are not big fans of corporate hotel or chains, I thought to look for a smaller nicer hotel not too far from the museum and center.... When I found the hotel Atlas I thought it would be perfect. It had good review on service quality and decoration from almost every guide... what a mistake not to have come and check Trip Advisor.... because frankly I found nothing posiitve about the hotel!!!!!!! My reservation was last minute, so I call on the day and reserved a double room for 6 nights. I sent an email with my american express card as guarantee. When I arrived after a day of work at 7pm in the hotel, the person at reception told me that Amex was not working and if I could use another card or go for cash... thing that I can not do... I had to insist until he called a manager who told him to enter the number of the card in the machine, as if not he did not want to give me a room... I must say that I must have known better has to pay in advance... but now with credit card it is mostly guarantee.... big mistake... Because on my second day I learned that will have to shorten my stay for personal family reason... I read the cancellation policy and was of course expecting to be paying one night cancellation fee (this is the policy if you do not cancel your room more than 3 days in advance). Then the first answer I was given was that 2 nights would be charge... I said that i found a little bit peculiar that they charge more if you are already here as if I would have been cancelling on my arrival day... Then they call a manager who said that nothing will be refunded as it was prepaid!!!!!! First of all this is not accordig to policy, and I will definitely block any charge to my credit card, but I think it is very tacky to try to rip off people... this probably because customer do not return!!!! Secondly when you think I reserved the day before you can imagine that I did not force them to turn down a lot of clients with my reservations so this is unacceptable and uncommercial... On top of this about the hotel itself.... The exterior is very nice and it is close to tram... but sincerly the room are very small and shabby... I would not have walked barefoot on the carpet...they try to make up for it with nice curtains and bed tops but it is still quite oppressive (my room was in the purples)... and please do not THAT YOU EVERYTHING YOUR NEIGHBOURS ARE DOING... so hope that you have quiet ones who do not wash TV, or speak..., and that your are not in a room near the floor door.... Last thing for the days when I was suppose togo in office, the breakfast that is noted to be serve aas from 7.30 is only served as from 8am... so i did not get anyway an apportunity to taste it! So my recommendation : do not go!!

Amsterdam by bicycle is hoot, once you get the hang of it. Anyway, the Atlas was a nice place to stay. The frist room we got was on the bottom floor, with it's own outside patio (not really nice, but it's space outside), but there was a really loud humming noise, from we assumed some system in the building... We asked to move. We got a nice, small room upstairs, with windows looking partially into the park.

We booked 2 double rooms from 8th - 10th December. Emailed the hotel in advance for directions from airport and received a prompt, informative response. Location is excellent. 10 minutes from Central Station by tram (no. 2) which stops literally less than 1 minute from the hotel. The hotel itself is quirky and quaint as I think has already been mentioned on this site. The lady on reception was lovely, she was only new but very nice and gave us maps and list of sights to see. The rooms themselves were spotless although extremely small, particularly the bathroom. A painting was clearly hanging off the wall in the bedroom, a very simple thing that could easily be sorted. Also the bathroom door didn't close properly. OK, so maybe I'm nit picking a little but 130Euro per night for a double room EXCLUDING breakfast is a bit steep for what we got. I know Amsterdam is a very populour destination but this is not city centre location and is only a 3* (if even that). In saying that, the Atlas Hotel really has something special, although I can't quite figure out what it is. I would definitely return again. Oh, beware of a 'tourist tax' whatever that is. \u00e2\u201a\u00ac6.50 per person on our hotel bill \"all tourists have to pay\" apparently?

We decided that we would write a book 'Quirky hotels we have stayed in' and start with this one. Hotel was ok, decor was a bit purple and more than a little like being trapped in a Mark Rothko canvas - a bit claustrophobic after a while. Hot water in the bathroom was VERY hot so be warned. Also having lugged my hairdryer all the way there, as the website said there was only one available at reception, I discovered one in the bathroom. Ho - hum. Also the owner's dog lives there, reasonably enough, but this combined with smoking was not entirely pleasant from my point of view. Smoking in confined spaces has only been prohibited in Britain since July 2007 - how quickly we adjust and become intolerant! At least I have. Upside is that the hotel is really handy for the trams (trusty old Number 2 tram will take you to Centraal Station and all points in between), some nice bars and restaurants. Don't miss the Cafe Luxembourg on Spui. Darlings, it is the only place to see and be seen, it has a non - smoking conservatory where the beautiful people sit. They always made me sit in the back - were they trying to tell me something?! Also any trip to Amsterdam would not be complete without a trip to the Rijksmuseum (2 stops on the Number 2) sadly still half closed for refurbishment and the Anne Frank Huis.
