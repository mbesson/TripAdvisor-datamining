The Albergotto Hotel was the first stop on our Italian holiday which was in celebration of our 30th wedding anniversary. We made our booking directly with the hotel and told them of our happy occasion. Upon our arrival we were given an upgrade and a complimentary bottle of wine. These gestures were nice but did not compensate for the lack of air conditioning which they list as one of their amenities. We expressed our concerns while checking in and were informed by a member of their desk staff that they simply haven't turned on the air conditioning yet. We asked about mosquitos and were told definitively that that would NOT be a problem. Needless to say, by the end of our three night stay, we were covered with mosquito bites. The open window also prevented us from getting any sleep because the vehicular and pedestrian noise never ceased throughout all three nights. A few hours before our departure, we were given a plug-in bug repellent and an aerosol bug spray for the room. When we voiced our complaints, the morning desk clerk acted unsimpathetic and indifferent to our displeasure at staying in a hot, noisy and mosquito infested room. She handed us hotel stationary and a pen and told us to write a letter to the manager about our complaints. We composed a 2 page letter and upon check out (one hour later) were given a 40 percent reduction for our last night's stay. A mere pittance for our pain and suffering. Coincidentally, the air conditioning was turned on just as we were preparing to leave. This was our 4th visit to Florence. The three previous visits were at a hotel a block away on the same street. The Hotel De La Ville treated us like royalty and is where we will definitely return on our next visit to Florence. Aside from the influx of mosquitos, no air conditioning, a broken lift, faded bedspread, the complimentary buffet breakfast was sparce and forgetable.

The location is perfect - right in the heart of Florence, close to all of the sights (Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, San Lorenzo Mkt, Santa Maria Novella) and the train/bus station, in the pedestrian part of town, so there are fewer cars, buses and motorbikes. The room was very clean, good sized with beautiful high ceilings and windows. Well furnished with a bed, a small 2-person sitting area, desk, and closet. TV and electric teapot with tea/coffee. The beds were a bit hard, but comfy with nice cotton sheets. Faded floral beadspread and curtains. The bathroom was good-sized with a tub and shower (hand shower). Thick, fluffy white towels hung on a towel heater. Tile and fixtures seemed new. The English-speaking staff were very helpful and friendly. Helped us to get tickets to the museum when we had no reservation. Check in/check out was very easy.Breakfast (included in the room rate) was very good - juices, several kinds of pastries and rolls, whole fruit, cereal, hardboiled eggs, ham and cheese. A waiter brought coffee, tea, hot chocolate, cappucino, etc - whatever you wanted. There were several newspapers in the sitting room in the morning. Other reviewers have mentioned the stairs to the first floor, and this would be a problem with travelers with mobility issues. The porter helped us with our bags, but there is really no other way to get to the 1st floor besides a pretty long climb. Also, we were very glad we booked ahead with an online booking agency.

I was anxious to find a hotel in Florence which would be very clean, not soulless, in a good location, with helpful staff and not extortionately expensive - and in this respect the Albergotto completely fit the bill. I had lived in Florence for a month last year so I did know the city and was delighted to find the Albergotto on one of my favourite streets. Via Tornabuoni is lovely as it comes off the Santa Trinita bridge, has some great designer shops to look at as you walk along and is really close to the centre and Oltrano. We booked through LastMinute.com and used the 'secret hotels' function (although I worked out that it was the Albergotto) so because it was cheaper I think our room was one of the smaller standard doubles, but it was very pleasant - extremely clean, with a nice en-suite and a bright airy bedroom. If we poked our heads out of the window we could just about see the Arno too - which is about as perfect as you can get! The staff were really helpful and friendly - very approachable without being intrusive. We didn't really require anything of them but it was nice to know that we could go and ask them things without worrying that they would be grumpy, inexperienced or hard to understand.While we were there it was hot in Florence (which was such a treat given the miserable summer in Britain!!) but the air-con worked fine and our room was a good temperature. On arrival we found a letter in the bedroom, along with some wine, apologising that there had been some problems with the satellite channels and they were trying to fix it. We turned on the tv once a day later and the channels were still all Italian but to be honest who is really going to be watching a lot of tv while staying in Florence?! (you can get english newspapers easily enough if you are desperate for a news fix)I really would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and if I am lucky enough to get back to Florence for another a mini-break I will definitely go there again.(the only thing some people might need to bear in mind - as mentioned in other reviews - is that there are some steps to get up to the reception/ lift.

My husband and I just returned from our honeymoon, and spent our last five days in Florence at the Hotel Albergotto. After having spent two weeks on a cruise ship, a few days in Venice, and a few more in Siena, we were very excited to be in Florence. The hotel was wonderful. We did have one of those front rooms, but the noise didn't seem too bad to us. We realize that we were in big city on a main road, so the type of typical traffic sounds are to be expected. On the third floor, you don't hear the walking traffic too much.The room itself was lovely, with high ceilings, and large floor to ceiling doors that open to Via Tournabuoni. The closet has more than enough space to accommodate a two-person wardrobe, there is a mini-bar so it is possible to refrigerate items, and of course, a safe.What I loved, however, were the bathrooms. In our Venice and Siena hotels, the bathrooms were small-ish, and the showers were tiny. When we saw our bathroom at the Albergotto, I was so excited because it was large, and has an actual bathtub to soak in. There is a lot of natural light through the frosted door, which for the ladies out there certainly helps with makeup application. :)The service staff was very friendly, especially with carrying all of our bags up the entry stairs. Our room was always cleaned by noon (even if we were only gone for an hour in the morning), and every day except one the beds were turned down.The breakfast wasn't anything to write home about, but the staff was very quick to ask for our coffee requests.

It has a 4 star rating and they must of stolen three of them. The hotel is in a PERFECT location for any vistor to the city. It is centrally located within walking distance to all the tourist points. The problem is the hotel itself. The reception of the hotel is on the first floor which is accessable by a couple of flights of stairs or a tiny elevator. Once checked in, you can take the stairs which are easier. The tiny elevator will always stop on the first floor which is very inconvenient and confusing if you are staying on the 2nd or 3rd floors. Also after a long day of walking around Florence, walking to the elevator is a real drag. The rooms are standard, nothing special and need work. My room at the front of the hotel, I might have well been sleeping in the square because the noise is incredible. The street leadiing into the square pulls the noise from the square plus the cafe next door is a busy drinking bar till late into the evening. Don't plan on quiet until about 2am. The rooms in the back of the hotel are better but the light is not as good and are in high in demand because of the noisy front rooms. The shower in one of the rooms had no temperature control once on, so midway through my shower I would be either scalded with extremely hot water or shocked with extrememly cold water. Very dangerous in the slippery tub. Also one of shower panels were missing so I would flood the bath room each time I took a shower. The hotel's breakfast is below average compared to other hotels that I have stayed at in Florence and especially for the room rate I paid. The breakfast is your standard bread and coffee breakfast with a small selection of fruit, ham and boiled eggs. If you are a big marmalade fan, half the breakfast table offering is trays of jams and marmalade. They advertise the breakfast starting from 7:30am to 10am, but they don't really get it together until about 8am. This is very inconvenient if you are on business and need to get an earlier start. I found the front desk staff to have major attitude and very unhelpful and rude. I inquired about the internet rate at the hotel and the night clerk had no idea what the rate they charged although I did manage to get the user name and password for the room. I inquired about another hotel number from the desk and the attitude I got was I asked for the number of a hotel on the moon. Another inquiry for how to dial a long distance call, I never got the answer, even after I came down from my room and was face to face with them. The service staff on the other hand was very good and helpful. The porter was very helpful and accomadating when needed. The wait staff in the breakfast room was always pleasant even if they didn't have it together on time. I have stayed at many Florence hotels and was taken aback by the qualtiy of the rooms and the front desk staff attitude for the rate they were charging compared to other Florentine hotels. The only benefit of this hotel is the location but you can also find a ton of hotels in the area for better prices and ammenitites. This is definatley a dud of a hotel and I think the management need to stay in their own hotel to understand what needs to be fixed. There are better quality and better priced hotels. The Albergotto hotel thinks it is better that it is. The need to get out and look at the competiton and maybe stay in one of their rooms to understand what their guest feel like.", "Date": "Jun 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR699925821", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "fashionfirst"}, {"Content": "Central location, super room I had booked two nights at the Antica Torre up the street (via Tornabuoni). When I arrived however they sent me up to this hotel for one night as Antica Torre had had a problem with their AC in my room the day I arrived. Initially I was unhappy as I was really looking forward to my terraced room at the A. T. However once I arrived I was charmed. The room was quite large with light-colored hardwood floors. (I am a sucker for hardwood). The bathroom was also fairly spacious, especially by European hotel standards, and was all tile. There was a large armoire in the room as well as a beautiful secretary type desk (the kind that folds open and closed). There were also a few chairs in the room. As you can see it was very spacious as there was ample room for these items with much room to spare. I'd say the room was at least 16x16 or maybe even larger. The large windows (which opened, typical European style) made the room very bright and airy. Adding to the room size was a sort of foyer when you first walked in to it, to your left was the bathroom and as you walked into the room itself you were then in the space described above. This was room 32. There was no real view other than to the street below, which was fine. You definitely did not feel cramped. I paid 230E for that night. My other night was at the AT as mentioned above and to be honest it was nearly a draw as to which I preferred. The terrace at the Antica Torre definitely edged it out, but, overall I much preferred my room at the Albergotto. Were it wintertime or just rainy/bad weather in general I would have stayed at the Albergotto instead as you wouldn't then have full enjoyment of the terrace at the AT.", "Date": "May 31, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR259658337", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "skywalkerbeth"}, {"Content": "Great Hotel in a Great Location and not super expensive! This hotel was great. We've stayed a couple of times now and we have never been dissappointed. The inclusive breakfast is more than plenty, the staff is knowledgeable and helpful,the rooms are very clean and above all you can't beat the location. Just next to Gucci, Prada, Roberto Cavalli, within a couple of blocks to the main Piazza. The rooms are decent sized especially for Italy. We paid $150 per night during August and about $99 during March. We will keep going back to this place. The only downside is you have to walk up from the street to the first floor and catch the small elevator. Not handicap or stroller friendly.
