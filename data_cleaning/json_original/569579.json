Congratulations to the wonderful staff who orchestrate this resort to perfection. Yes it is a big resort, but I have never been to a resort that is so well run. There is never a problem to find beach or pool chairs, umbrellas or shade. They are one of the few resorts that actually cater to the large occupation rate they have by having so many umbrellas. palapas and chairs. We loved sitting in the beautiful Grand mayanPools which are exquisite and very elegant, one of the most serene pool areas I have seen,this area is called the Sanctuary, and the flora there is magnificent. however earlier in the trip when our grand children were here, we sat at the Mayan pools as it seemed to be better for the children. One can book the extra large palapas by being down at the pool at 7 am where wonderful Carla makes the reservations. These are huge and comfortable and are at a cost of 350 pessos a day, or if you spend this amount in food before 5 pm that day, this will cover the cost. It is a very organised way of booking these palapas, and therefore nobody is fighting at the pools as you see typically everywhere in Mexico and the Carribean. I timed the walk, which was exactly 10 minutes to the left of the hotel towards the Valentine Hotel, where the great swimming beach is, the water is just wonderful and no rocks an easy walk, wear shoes as the beach is rocky. You will enjoy the beautiful swim and ocean there. The restaurants in the hotel are all good. Tremonte has a special charm, more upscale and romantic, good food. Fridas at the pool was also nice and had a mariachi group on Friday nights who were wonderful, the kids enjoyed them. I found the drive of 25 minutes tiresome to get to Playa at night for dinner, however the town is charming, people are wonderful and it is very safe. Last night on the main street, fifth Ave, we saw a policeman approach a young man who had a beer in his hand, I asked him afterwards and he said that one is not allowed to drink on the main street, only in the restaurants. I thought this was wonderful and it showed how aware they are of keeping the city safe. Mister Anonio Perez who is the front dest manager in the Mayan hotel is so capable and they are really so lucky to have a man like this at their front desk, it is people like him who make ones stay so wonderful, always their to be of great assistance. I must mention Julio the carpenter who organised two cribs so perfectly for our grand daughters, he took of the wheels so that they would not move around every time the babies moved. The gym is very nice and very well equpped with all the latest exercise machines. Generally the food is good in the hotel and not over priced. The grocery store in the hotel is well stocked and although a little more pricey than the stores in town not too expensive. They have great ice cream, crepes and sandwiches that they make to order. It is centrally situated and close to all pools. The man made beach where the kids pool is, is really nice for the smaller children. I must mention, I told them at check in that I did not want any calls from the timeshare people and have been here nearly 2 weeks and have not been bothered by them. I highly recommend this resort for familys with children and really congratulate them on everything that is to perfection, in every direction, onecan eat off of the floors in this hotel.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable!\u201d", "Author": "VacationFun2012", "ReviewID": "UR126614438", "Content": "The Grand Mayan is an awesome place to stay!

It was amazing. After reading some of the reviews on here I thought I was well prepared but quickly realized that people just love to complain! The only thing that would make this resort top notch is a better beach. However we did find the beach that was about a 10 min walk along the shore. Everything else is spectacular. The food was amazing. We mainly ate at the Beach Snack bar, Havanna Moon and the deli. The drinks were very well made and always ice cold (Happy hour was great!). The bed was not as bad as some people say. It's not your bed at home so in comparison any bed wouldn't be good enough, the shuttles to the lobby were a 15 min wait MAX and you're on vacation, what's your hurry? While you wait you can take in the nature around you or strike up a conversation with someone. To be honest I don't think we waited more the 10 min. We did visit Playa Del Carmen a couple of times, once for the beach and once to head to WalMart where we saved a lot on drinks. A 6 pack of Corona for about $5, can't go wrong! The prices for everything on the resort are just like back home. Nothing is \"Mexican\" pricing. So don't be shocked when you hit the buffet and pay $30 a person. We were only approached about the time share the first day we got there and never heard about it again. If you're nice enough to them they'll be nice enough to you. Some people make it sound as though it ruined their whole vacation. Definitely not the case! All the shuttle services and cab drivers where very friendly. About $22 to Playa. I would recommend this place to anyone and would plan to go again, just better prepared to not expect \"Mexican\" prices.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toms River", "Title": "\u201cAn Adventurous Vacation\u201d", "Author": "nonni-pop", "ReviewID": "UR126585604", "Content": "We are owners of Mayan Palace and when our original vacation fizzled out last minute, we called our resort to see where there was availability. Unfortunately the week we chose for our vacation was Spring Break and there wasn't a whole lot available. That's why our original plans fizzled out. We couldn't get to our original destination because of flight issues. When we called Mayan they were very accommodating and even stayed on the phone with us while we were walking through the airport. They had a week in Mayan Palace Riviera Maya and we jumped on it and off we went. When we went to check in, they upgraded us to the Grand Mayan at no additional charges. All the folks at the concierge desk were very helpful in trying to get our luggage to us and located, since it didn't arrive when we did. The resort is very nice and safe. There are only a few things we did not like about this resort. The beach is very rocky and you can't swim in the ocean. We went to several of the restaurants and extremely enjoyed Gong. It's one of their new ones with an Asian flare. It was the best dinner on the grounds. We also went to Havannah Moon which is right on the beach. It was the worst dinner we had on the grounds. My drink was watered down and my husbands food was warm not hot as it should have been. And of course you always have to go through the timeshare updates. They will try to tell you anything to get you to upgrade, but in the end when we told them we really couldn't afford it, they backed off. One other thing that was a bit of a bother.

Be prepared to do some walking, Period. The walks to the lobby, pools, restaurants are on a very nice cement walkway through the tropical trees, plants etc, It's a tropical rain forest! There are shuttles that run every 15 mins or so, but I just couldn't believe all the people complaining about how far everything was. Yes you are about 20 minutes from Playa Del Carman, Either take the shuttle provided by the resort for $5.00 a person or take a taxi for $20.00 - $23.00 depends on the driver, but no more than $23.00. Get to the Walmart and get some supplies it will save you some $$$ We always ate breakfast in the room, cereal, toast etc.... Get some beer for pool side, best tip I can give you, they don't like coolers at the pool, So, Google, beach bag coolers, we took two of them with us and they were a huge hit. It is very expensive to drink around the pool for 2 weeks buying there drinks! So go to Walmart get some SOL or Corona's because that's what they sell there and your good to go. The service is great, from the bartenders, front desk to the maids everyone is very friendly. The resort comes alive very early, like 5:30 - 6:00 with all the birds chattering and resort traffic, We had some noisy people on the floor above us the 2nd week, Rude!

This was our first visit to Mexico and our experience exceeded expectations. I was a bit nervous about going...the violence, the food etc. but had nothing to worry about. As a family of four, we felt safe with our teenagers hanging out at the resort on their own. We ate well and not one of us got sick. As an RCI exchange, we were placed in \"the jungle\" as we knew we would be from other trip advisor reviews. Surprisingly we loved every minute of it as it was a stunning walk everywhere and really not long....maybe ten minutes top. There was so much to look at that we looked forward to walking. Also shuttles with yellow flags came around like clockwork every ten minutes if we didn't feel like walking. Yes, when we checked in, the timeshare reps. tried to get us to sit in on a presentation on the Monday but we said \"no\"and they totally left us alone. We found the restaurants great. Not pricey at all and had excellent meals. We tried a new one each night and ate breakfast in our room. Tramonto in particular was awesome. Gong too if you are into sushi. We took a cab to Playa del Carmen and stocked up on groceries, beer and wine shortly after arriving. The taxis are waiting near the lobby so easy to get one. The cab driver waited for us and brought us right back to our room with all of our bags. Very reasonable...about $40 plus tip. We also used a cab to get back to the airport. We had to check out at ten so the hotel stored our bags while we waited to leave. They arranged the taxi as well to drive us to the airport. $37 plus tip. All easy and efficient. The pools are awesome. So many and so beautiful. We never had trouble finding a place to sit. Happy hour is 11 to 1 and the drinks are double sized. Loved the cashless system. Never had to worry about carrying money. We went snorkeling one day and it was a fantastic experience. Three swims, a Mexican buffet with an open bar, and a live Mexican band for eighty dollars per person. We saw so many beautiful fish and all of us loved it. See Mauricio at the concierge to book it.

This was an outstanding resort and made for a wonderful vacation for my family. Visually a very attractive resort. Wonderful accommodations in our two bedroom swap with RCI. We were placed in \"the Jungle\" which means you are about a 8 minute walk to the lobby and pools. Not an issue to us especially since the shuttles ran constantly to and from the Jungle buildings, which by the way are more recently built. The unit is very spacious, lots of granite and marble overlooking the golf course. The gardens alone must have cost a fortune at this resort. Extensive pools, several very good restaurants, palapas (sp)everywhere (beds around the pools believe it or not). Plenty of sun and shaded areas. We really only went into town once since the resort has everything. The resort staff was very friendly and always willing to support a terrific vacation. The only draw back we found was that after initially taking a reservation for the sales talk, we canceled out after hearing numerous stories from other vacationers about the strong sales pitch. Too bad because after enjoying the experience we thought the place could sell itself. We were not concerned about our safety at all. We stayed with the resort cabs and shuttles. If you are considering this resort, do not hesitate. It is a fabulous place, in my opinion. We would go back if we could but this resort has the 1 in 5 rule about returning unless you own. The beach area does not allow for swimming very easily due to the coral. However we walked to the left on the beach and about 15min away is a nice beach if you feel you need it which we did not.

Originally was to be placed in a Jungle building room but after some negotiations with the front desk at check-in, ended up with a 2 bedroom suite in one of the newer buildings (The Bliss) near the Mayan Palace area, so not that far of a walk to the main building, pools or Greenbreak (which is also the main pickup area for any booked tours). New rooms and spotless with very good daily maid service. After reading the previous reviews, the 4 of us took a taxi to Wal-Mart in Playa to stock up on breakfast and other supplies for the suite. Prices were quite reasonable, btw, for the most part. And if you want to stock up on things like soda & beer, this is the time and place. If you buy alot, the helpful bell staff at the resort will help transport your goodies back to the room. We had learned a valuable lesson about the company's time share presentation from a previous stay at the Neuvo Vallarta property, so just keep saying no, and you'll be fine. Elsewise, you'll lose almost 1/2 a day trying to get away from the presentation. All in all, a wonderful and relaxing trip. One afternoon we went into Playa to stroll 5th Avenue and have dinner. Wouldn't probably stay longer than that - a very commercial area. Another day, had a change of pace by going to the beach at Puerto Morelos, a small village with very hospitable locals. Finally, took the one day tour to see the ruins at Tulum and then onto Xel-ha. Tulum was quite impressive but then having just 5 hours at Xel-ha wasn't enough time to really enjoy and explore all their facilities.

While I had requested SEVERAL MONTHS before our trip, to be placed in a building close to the lobby, we were shown to the jungle. Now, dont get me wrong, the jungle rooms are the newest in the Grand Mayan, however, they are FAR from the lobby. The golf carts come every 20 minutes, so if you miss one, you wait and wait some more!! We were able to speak with the room co-ordinator, Jazman, who did switch our room Thursday of our first week. She was very helpful and curtious. We were switched to building 7, which is an easy walk to the pools and restaurants, however, the room had a musty smell each time we entered it.. So, take your pick, closer and a bit smelly, or farther and wait!! Our room was cleaned daily and our bed was turned down each night. Our bed was a bit hard and we asked for and were given a cushion for the top of the mattress. Our kitchen was stocked nicely, but could have used some sharp knives. There is a wading pool on the balcony and depending on where you are, it can be nicely heated by the sun, or ice cold! The grounds are meticulous and the pools are very clean. A few of the pools had a tile or two missing, in which case the bottom was sharp. We did encounter a few people that cut their feet on the tile. There are plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas, chairs, and beds around the pool area. The beds are free, IF you spend 30.00 in the day, which is easy to do and well worth it! There are plenty of pools, even a pool set up like a beach! All pools had waiters who ran constantly to keep you happy. The Grand Mayan guests have the added bonus of quite a unique setting, almost zen like. After exiting the lobby, you move into an area which holds several pools and beds under a canope which lets in the sun, but is not full sun, and is quite delightful, especially for those who burn easily! The beach is NOT SWIMABLE. Several brave souls ventured into the water, but even with water shoes were cut by the sharp rocks.You can walk about a mile to the left or right of the Grand Mayan to a beach that is swimable, but there are no amenities..chairs, umbrellas, snacks etc.. Just beach. We didn't have children with us, but there is a great childrens schedule. We noticed children painting face masks, a pinata party, a movie night, a scavenger hunt and pizza party. All the children seemed to be enjoying themselves. The food is good, fairly priced, however, a can of coke will cost you 3.19 US. We took a taxi (21.00) each waY into Playa to the Walmart and stocked up on snacks, drinks and breakfast options. There were different options available in the diningroom on the premises...Land and sea night, Mexican night, Carribean night etc. Some were fairly priced, while others we thought were excessive. Green Break had a nice breakfast buffet for 14 us dollars. There are two specialtyy restaurants on premises one is Italian, the other is sushi.. Both are excellent! We opted to gointo town several nights. We dined ar Karens (exceptional) El Ranchero, (excellent) Ambasciata D Italia (superb) and La Parrilla Playa which does a magnificent grilled fish platter with lobster for two for about 65.us dollars. We were not too happy with the price of the taxis into town each way is 21.us dollars. The resort does offer a shuttle, but it goes into town at 6pm and returns at 9pm, which really does not give you enough time to eat in a relaxed fashion. The cost of the shuttle is 5us dollars each way per person, and they JAM you in. Each shuttle has about 12 people in it! We found ourselves eighter taking the shuttle in and a cab back, or taking a cab in and the shuttle back. We did spend the day at mosquito beach in Playa. It was very nice. If you eat and drink at the place, the chairs and umbrellas are free for the day. One thing That really ticked me off was the use of the internet/wifi. If you wanted internet for the week it was...95.00 thats right 95.00 per week! If you purchased wifi for one hour it was 6.00, but you had to use ut all at once. If you went to the computer room, you could buy time on their computer and sign in and out on a given password for 6.00 an hour. But, be sure you sigh out completely, i lost almost 40 minutes because I was told that I did not sign out properly!! Consider carefully visiting the Timeshare sales presentation. It takes up at least four hours of your day. Personally, it wasnt worth a free breakfast, although they did give you 100. in room credit, and 10 percent off your bill. They are pushy individuals and pawn you off to about 4 different people before FINALLY letting you get on with your vacation.

Plus she said our room wouldn't be ready until 5 and the room in the Palace would be ready right now. DON'T fall for that tactic, the Grand Mayan is much better than the Palace. Just say no thanku, grab your bathing suit and enjoy the pool until your room is ready. I had planned to make all our meals during our stay and it's great that in the Deli you can buy fruit, veggies, bread, eggs, milk etc. They also have amazing crepes and sandwiches, ice creams and coffee in the Market. It's the cheapest meal you'll have at the resort and it's fantastic. If you're like me, you bring a \"starter kit\" to get through week. I bring a baggie of salt, sugar, pepper, flour, and ground coffee, dry pasta and rice, cereal and oatmeal. I also brought a little bottle of dish detergent and coffee filters but the room comes with those items. If you want to take a trip into Playa to go to the beach or Walmart, take the mexican city \"bus\". Which is not even a bus, it's a mini van. The resort will try to warn you that it's dangerous and risky but really it's convenient and much cheaper than taking the shuttle or their cab service. The easiest and cheapest way to do it is to grab the yellow shuttle to the Mayan Jungle and get off at building 13 and walk to the entrance. You'll have to cross the highway. There are always \"buses\" waiting. We grabbed a bus/mini van and the driver only wanted 2 pesos per person. Plus he drove us all the way to Playa without stopping to pick anyone else up. Once you get to 5th avenue, Walmart is just a couple of blocks up. You can walk no problem. The Mayan has a shuttle service to take you back to the resort (located in the parking garage) but a cab ride is only 20$.

More on those later. Let me start with things to like about the resort, including cleanliness, non-sales worker attitude, and activities on site. Food was generally quite good. Prices were not exorbitant, roughly US meal prices, though you can get the same quality cheaper in Playa del Carmen, and much cheaper in Puerto Morelos. For getting around, there are shuttles and taxis, but I would consider a rental car. Highway 307, Cancun to Tulum, is no more difficult than a US highway. Now, onto the negatives. The Grand Mayan wants to be a 5 star resort, but they seriously skimped on wall thickness. My neighbors through the connecting door had a roughly 2 year old boy, which I knew through his near-nightly screaming fit. My neighbors across the hall heard one of them. Beyond that, while I was sitting at the eating table, about 2 meters from the wall, I heard their normal conversation. I do not want to know that they had spaghetti on Monday night. I do not want to hear heels clicking in the hall. I've reviewed 5 star hotels, and this would be crazy at a Park Hyatt or JW Marriott. I've had quieter experiences at Super 8. The timeshare sales experience was also horrible. I've been on several timeshare presentations before, generally about 2 hours. This was much worse, 5 hours of pain, 8:15 - 1:15. There was checkin, breakfast, main talk, 2 managers, \"other company\", and \"other company manager\" - FIVE different men. There were outright lies. There was inappropriate touching. There was treating my companion like an idiot. None of the men were locals, which makes sense, because the people in the area are nice.

Most of the reviews I read prior to our vacation (returned home yesterday) were pretty much spot on. Buildings 1-4 are the ones you want to be in unless you have a strong desire to walk a distance whenever you decide to go somewhere. If you like to walk that's fine, but keep in mind that if you forget anything at your room you have to take a hike back just to get (say) your sunglasses. And by the way, the layout of the resort is quite confusing and you are subject to walk around pool areas to get from point A to point B. Not a problem but it does tend to get annoying after awhile. It may sound trite, but if you get a studio unit it does not come with any kind of facilities, e.g., a fridge, microwave, or even a coffee maker. Not having these facilities forces one to buy everything at the resort, which gets kind of spendy. Bring a soft cooler with you, if only to carry drinks and what not. Best bet is to go into town (Playa del Carmen) to the Walmart and pick up supplies. However, you will need something to keep your perishables cool. They sell coolers there as well. Also, if you are one for being in a town, and or on the beach, this is NOT the place for you. The cost of taxis or shuttles to and from really starts to add up and the Grand Mayan lacks the ambience/convenience of being in a beachside town. Please keep in mind that this is a resort in the true sense of the word. The staff at the GM was quite friendly and accommodating as long as you don't ask for anything above and beyond what was offered with your particular room program. Our room was cleaned and or refreshed twice a day. Really quite nice! Other Thoughts You can rent a car but than you are subject to being pulled over by the police or ending up in a less than desireable situation, which based on all reports, is a fairly common occurrence. The Hertz at the resort wanted $80's per day as a weekly rate to rent a compact car. It appears as though there are 18 buildings in the resort and the larger the number the farther you are away from the hotel lobby (main area) WE stayed in building #2, which was made available only after I haggled with the time share rep who wanted us at their presentation. This was quite a feat in as much as it is not easy to get into buildings 1 thru 4. Trust me on this. Those units are really reserved for special individual programs. We had no inclination to go to the presentation and I thought I could get rid of the rep by telling him that was the only way I would accommodate his request :>) Somehow he pulled it off. By the way, the presentation turned out to be a good deal for us. Not only did we get the building of our choice, but 10% off our room charges, 2000 pesos ($160'sUS) which also applied to the room charges, and a free breakfast buffet. The woman we dealt with was quite interesting and we spent exactly 3 hours before they would let us go without buying a time share. First morning there, and a good way to acquaint yourself with the resort itself. Anyway, I hope this helps. Nice place. Had a nice time. Probably wouldn't go back to stay in as much as I really prefer a good beach and being in and around the ocean. Also prefer being able to walk out of my hotel into more of a townlike environment with shops and such. PS you are approx 20 minutes north of Playa del Carmen and 30 miutes south of Cancun. One way taxi fares to either place range between $20-40's US.

So, for those who are worry about this tax, rest easy, it came out to $28peso per day. Food at Balche restaurant was excellent. Hostest and the manager were excellent.

I want to begin by saying that their is nothing to complain about at this resort. It is 25 mins south of Cancun airport and 20 mins north of Playa. Email the concierge and get the free shuttle from the airport to the resort. You will need a taxi for $30 to get back. Tip - You can take a collectivo van on the highway 20 pesos, shuttle for 5$ each way or taxi for $18 each way to Playa. Take your pick. Tio- Bring a soft cooler bag and pack drinks and snacks for around the pool and save going back and forth to the room Everyone complains but the 10 min walk to and from pool is beautiful. Or wait 20-30 mins for the shuttles. Your pick. Be patient or walk. Big resort, hundreds of people. Restaurants - Havana moon pizza was fantastic! Salads and sandwiches good too. Rest of menu just ok. Gong restaurant was amazing for Japanese in Mexico. Wow! The largo buffet on the lagoon is fantastic. Not cheap but worth it! Fish at the Mexican restaurant was so good. We asked the waiters what to order and they delivered. Kids club - our 7 and 9 yr olds loved the staff. They were so friendly and kind to our kids. Short fun 1 hr activities all day but gave us some space and time. Pirate party Wednesday nite was a hit with our kids too. 5.30-9.30 great date nite for us. This is not a drop your kid off all day kids club but still excellent. Pools - what can you say. The best resort pools you will ever find. Incredible. We loved the private grand Mayan pool. Everything right there for everyone. Kids club, bar, sand, river, infinity pool over the lagoon. The best spot. Beach is not for beach lovers but it is still a beautiful sandy walk. Lots of rock in the water so difficult to swim in but still an awesome spot to sun and relax. It is always windy when we have visited so the waves are always quite big anyway. If you need to cool off walk 15 feet to the massive pools and cool off and hit your beach chair for a sun and snooze session. We did most of our breakfast and lunches in the room. Most of our dinners at the resort. Store is reasonable but not Walmart prices and deli is great too. This is a great holiday for families and couples.

How one would ever want to do business with people who from the very start use deceit and pressure tactics to draw you in their nets is beyond me, but apparently plenty of people do. For us it was a deal. For $1200 we had a 2 BR lockout, which comes down to a price per room that is less than for your average room at the Red Roof Inn along the interstate. Given this low price, I was very impressed with the level of service offered. Yes, if you are not an owner you won't be in any of the close buildings. We ended up in building 9, but the walk really is not that bad. We only took the golf carts a couple of times but I really preferred the nice stroll to the pool. Anyone ever noticed how slim people are walking and fat people are on the trolley? Food is good, not great, but reasonably priced. If you come from nowhere, Iowa, these prices might be a bit steep, but they are really reasonable compared to big city prices. Pizza, sandwiches, nachos at the pool are all shareable and tasty and will set you back about 9-15$, a beer 4$, mixed drinks around $6-$10. Tip your waiter and ask for strong drinks. Tried a couple of restaurants, never was blown away, but never was disappointed either. Breakfast and dinner buffet at Del Lago was excellent. Pools are great, though populated by the most obnoxious creature of them all: the ageing jock. They go [--] when happy hour starts, refer to each other by the names of the city or state they hail from (\"Hey Chicago, you gonna drink that girly drink?\") and are really excited about pool volley. Stay at the Grand Mayan pools to avoid these plebiscites. If you go to Playa Del Carmen, be aware of scammers in the street who pretend to be a waiter at the Grand Mayan on their day off and to recognize you. My white guilt kicked in because I did not recognize the guy, but of course it ended with us visiting his little jewelry store he helps his mom in one day a week and where he tried to charge us $100 for some Mayan ear rings . He got really rude when we declined. Only later did I realize that he was not a waiter at the GM, but had recognized us by our wrist bands. Be aware that you stand out as a target with your wrist bands in PDC. Beach is bad, but walk north 10 mins and you will find a great beach with great surf. Internet only works half of the time. Ask for a credit if that's the case. I got half my money back. Tennis is $10. We paid initially, but then just went there and played. They don't notice.

They did talk us into a contract with the Mayan Palace (they called daily for an apt which is annoying) which we are already having second thoughts about so check any contract throughly before signing, they do stretch the truth more than a bit so be warned and go by the wording of the contract, not what they say verbally. The resort itself is huge but there is a very good shuttle service so there are no problems at all getting around. We were in bulding 10 which is in the Jungle section. We loved the Grand Mayan pool area, it has lots of shaded areas for people who burn like my husband and for tanning like myself. The palapas I believe are first come first serve but the ones in the Mayan Palace pool can be reserved ahead of time,we didn't know that until our last day there. There is a fee but that comes off your food/service bill for the hotel, There are 8 or 9 restaurants. We loved the Havana Moon the best, service and food was outstanding - our favourite was th chicken tir fry. del Lago was also very nice for breakfast as well as the special evenings with provided entertainment. We found out the last day there that Balchi's had a breakfst buffet that was very good also. Yes the beach area is rocky (coral) but if you have swim shoes, you shouldn't have a problem and there is lots of nice sand. We had a suite which was more than adequte but not sure the kitchen was worthwhle if it costs $200 pesos for two people to get to and from Wal Mart for a few groceries. Most resorts provide a grocery shuttle free, not this one. There is high speed internet available throughout the grounds but it's very expensive. You can purchase by the hour, day or week. A screen will come up the first time you try to get on the internet. Communication appears to be an issue since a lot of services we didn't know about until we talked to other guests. A sheet explaining services, restaurant themes, internet, car rentals etc would have been very helpful. Also beware of taking excursons from anyone other than those providing a dependable 'large' bus - we took one to Tulum and Xel Ha and were not picked up at the end of the day - it took an expensive taxi ride to get back to the resort (later refunded by tour) but it wasn't a pleasant experience. Rooms were spotless and they have maid service daily with also a turn down servide at night - honestly I think I would have preferred to have one cleaning at the end of the first week only, not daily. They provide envelopes for tips at the end of the stay (maid and turn down service) even though 15% is tacked onto everything purchased...services, food etc. Jade is a nice store with high end jewellery, souvenires, groceries and a snack bar. At the end of Jade is a section with computers for use of wifi but there is still a fee for internet use there.

We all had a fabulous time! The only reason I haven't given this resort a 5 is because of the beach. Although the water is extremely clean and very beautiful, it isn't possible to enjoy the beach as much as we normally do. We did however spend a little time at the beach and we were able to make our way into the water slowly! If you're interested in a beach, a 10 minute taxi ride will take you to Puerto Morelos, the beach here was beautiful. We visited the Grand Mayan pool on a daily basis and enjoyed happy hour from 11-1. The margaritas were great! I read some previous reviews that mentioned some of the drinks were weak, but we found them just fine. One tip I hadn't read about in other reviews was the reservation process for the palapas. As long as you spend $30 at the pool areas on food and/or drinks, the palapa ends up being free. The only catch is that you have to reserve your palapa the day before. Find out what time in the morning the palapa representative opens, and make sure you're there at that time. If it's 7:30, some people start lining up at 7:00am. I went and 7:30 and was still able to reserve a palapa for the next day. You can also be put on a stand by list, so ask about that if you don't make it in time. If you'd rather not go through the trouble of the palapas, reserve the pool chairs with the \"shade\" tops and sit by a tree. By reserve I mean, place your beach towels down before breakfast, and they'll still be there when you get back. The palapa was really nice for the 2 year old, he was able to take his naps here. We had lunch daily at Balche, and the food was very good. Surprisingly the pizza was great, they were baking the pizza in a brick oven! As far as the time share presentation goes, we are owners of a different time share and reserved here with RCI exchange. As a result we weren't interested in doing the time share thing. We had read all the negative reviews and my husband and I decided we would be firm with our \"NO\" when we were approached and that's what we did. We were approached at check-in as well as having 2 calls to our room. We said NO, we don't want to spend the time, and we weren't bothered again. They did offer 10% off the food bill overall, one free breakfast, as well as 10% off of an activity, which made it somewhat appealing, but we kept remembering the terrible reviews and still insisted NO. The time share sales are a big part of this resort, you see the reps and tours being held throughout the day, it's quite surprising. Just say NO and mean it if you're not interested. If you're interested in the discounts, you might go through a bit of torture. The restaurants in the resort are great. Our favorite was the Asian one. The sushi was fabulous. We have great sushi places here in NY so we're a bit spoiled. The sushi at this restaurant was equal to our NY sushi. We also had the stir fried duck as well as some other items on the menu. It was all great. We also followed the recommendation of another reviewer here and reserved the pier for dinner at Havana Moon. The cost was an extra $100 over anything you order from the menu. This was a treat for my husband and I as well as our children. It was very nice being spoiled. Uziel was our server and we felt bad watching him run back and forth along the pier to bring drinks, appetizers, more drinks & then dinner, but he always did it with a smile. If you don't mind the extra $100 over your dinner cost, it's well worth it, the food and the location was beatiful. The restaurants were so satisfying we didn't feel the need to leave the resort. My daughter and I went into Playa's 5th Avenue for souvenir shopping. We took a cab from the hotel and then from the taxi \"hub\" there on 5th, so we felt we were playing it safe. Buy your souvenirs from the larger shops, their prices are mutch better than the smaller shops. The exchange rate here was also much better than the hotel, we exchanged for 12.50 pesos to $1 US. I've read some reviewers complain about no coffee pot, no refrigerator and hard mattresses. We stayed in a grand master suite so we had the coffee pot, refrigerator and the mattress was just fine. We used the \"boutique\" & shopped for breakfast items, such as eggs, milk, cereal, fruit and water and we had breakfast in the room. The boutique prices weren't so bad. If you figure the cost and trouble of going to walmart which is about 20 minutes each way (w/out traffic, yes, mexico has traffic!), it's not a bad idea just to get it from the hotel boutique. It all depends on how much you want to buy and whether you plan on cooking dinner in the room. If you plan on eating more in the room, make sure your room is stocked with a kitchen and then make a run to walmart. Our room also had the plunge pool on the balcony which the boys also enjoyed a couple of times. We were in building 9, which wasn't bad for us. I walked back & forth from the room to the lobby a couple of times and skipped the golf cart. I enjoyed the excercise, the weather, and the vacation itself. Many people walk throughout the grounds, it's very safe and an enjoyable walk if you like to walk. Although I would have liked a few more signs within the resort to make finding things a little easier. The signage is very limited and you find yourself walking in cirlces at times, which was funny. A concierge desk is located at each of the buildings, which makes it nice for any questions or reservations you might want to make. We read that reservations were recommended and we did so. The reservation was honored promptly each time. The Mexican Fiesta is very nice on Thursdays. The entertainment was very enjoyable and the food was good too. They had a piniata to break for the kids, which my 11 yr old loved! They have more than 1 piniata if it breaks before all the kids have an opportunity to hid the piniata which was also nice. The only problem was the buffet line was long at the beginning of the night. I used the Brio spa for the tequila massage. It was wonderful, the massage tech and all the techs in the spa are were extremely respectful and very professional. I also used the gym once, I was able to use the spa sauna, showers and jacuzzi after the gym which was also made it convenient to get ready for the pool whcih was right outside the building, another plus! One more thing I wanted to mention was that we flied into Cozumel instead of Cancun. This way we got to see Cozumel for a bit. The airfare was much cheaper flying into Cozumel. The process getting to Playa and then to the hotel was a bit tiring, we started contemplating whether it was worth the saved money. If you're a couple traveling lightly and without children it might be worth it. If you chose to do this and travel with a few suitcases like we did, make sure you us one the the tricycle men to ride your baggage up the hill. They only work on tips, and it's well worth the tip, the hill is quite a hill going upwards! When you're ready to check out of the resort, do so the night before which save a lot of time. We also reserved our taxi the night before, the bell boys take the reservation and they'll have the taxi pick you up from your bldg, which was nice. They don't want you lugging your baggage out to the lobby area. Overall we always felt extremely safe in the hotel resort. The resort was very luxurious and very clean. The staff was always extremely friendly and helpful. With so many stories out there about \"Mexico\", this is our second time in Mexico and we really enjoyed ourselves both times. Have fun!!!

Believe me when I say I know time shares. I have been through at least 40 presentations at every type of program from Westin, Hyatt, Marriott, Royal Resorts, Wyndham, Diamond Resorts and I know the ins and outs of what makes each program tick. I also own 5 weeks of premium lock-off timeshare units in Maui that I have purchased over the past 15 years (all bought on the secondary market) that I can trade in to II or RCI for 10 weeks to at virtually any Gold Crown resort in the world. -Nice pool?

If you are trading into the resort, plan on walking \u00bd mile to a mile every time you want to leave your room for anything. Keep in mind that the property itself extends all the way from the highway to the beach and all the accommodations are built around the par 3 golf course in the center of the resort. So there are no beach front or ocean view rooms. If fact, 80% of the rooms are at least \u00bc mile from anything. So you can wait 30 minutes for the next over-crowded van to come pick you up so that you can go the store to buy a liter of water, or you can walk another \u00bd to get to the main resort area again. Nothing like waiting 30 minutes so that you pay $15 for a 6-pack of beer or $6 for a dozen eggs at their grossly overpriced 7-11 style market. The pool certainly is big, but you need all that room to get as far away form all the noise. If you like screaming kids, kids and more kids, walking \u00bd mile to the beach, paying $8 for a quart of milk then this is La Vida (The Life) for you. And don't forget the bug spray because the resort is completely surrounded by ponds, rivers and jungle. Pretty until you realize that means hordes of biting insects too.

The beach area is just there for the pictures, still unable to walk in the water due to rocks, but if you head north on the beach for about 12 mins you will come across a public beach where the sand and waves are great. You can run into the water feel no rocks, play in the waves, but be aware of large under tow in area and no life guards on in the public beach area. Shuttle to the airport is $15 per head, works out for the smaller groups, but for 5 or more best get your own van for $75 to the airport as then you have room, otherwise they are trying to fill the seats.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cService sucks but pools are great\u201d", "Author": "SassyTravelerDC", "ReviewID": "UR125576697", "Content": "We are owners and had upgraded to the Grand Mayan. Call me crazy, but as an owner I expected better service. The front desk experience was so horrid we were livid by the time we finished checking in. They made us go to 3 different counters and lines to check-in. You would have thought it was amateur hour and not a large corporation that has been around for decades. We received no check-in information and spent needless time later in the week running around like idiots because they never gave us basic information. We even spoke to a manager and he just shrugged his shoulders. We checked in on a Saturday and found the service the rest of the week to be a tad better. We've stayed at several Mayan properties and this service sucked even worse in comparison. I won't get into the details because it would take 2 pages and I'd be hopping mad again just writing it. All I'll say is they let someone who was not authorized, had no paperwork, no proof, and didn't ask for ID check in under our name. Our first suite was on the ground floor and we found dozens of bugs and a leak. We did get checked into the building or area we asked for. We had to wait a couple of nights before they could move us. Our first suite was in The Jungle and you need to take the shuttles to get to the main area. The shuttles are color coded and only pick up at certain driveways even though they will drop you off at any driveway. This took days for us to to figure out and we weren't the only ones having problems. We heard complaints from other guests and saw others riding around in different shuttles routes trying to get back to their rooms. How about a little orientation packet like maybe a 1 page color coded map?? Our 2nd suite was on the 2nd floor closer to the main area. Even though our 2nd room was closer to the pools/beach it's still a hike. I'd say a good 10-15 min walk. No bugs but the floors were dirty so you ended up with black feet. This is a regular problem at all the Mayans we stayed at. BTW we stayed in a 2 bed/2 bath. They are nice, but do not look like the models you see when you're on the timeshare tour. The rooms are spacious though and otherwise pretty nice with a little dipping pool outside. The pools are beautiful but not heated. The Grand Mayan pools in particular feel very posh. The Mayan pools are closer to the beach and common areas such as the spa, gift shop, and restaurants. The beach is not swimmable though there are areas over a 15 min walk away off property that you can try to get to. However, the rocky areas are amazing for watching fish in the tidepools and off the pier. Absolutely incredible to have schools of fish swim around your feet! The common amenities like the spa and gift shop are very nice. We took a cab to Walmart (small) and Mega (Mexican version of Walmart) in Playa del Carmen. Everything is on or right off of 5th Ave. We spent several nights in Playa shopping, having dinner, and getting massages. We loved 5th Ave. It costs around $20 USD incl tip each way. Be sure to negotiate your price first. The cabs have different zones. You can also negotiate and have your cab wait for you, take you shopping, or on tours. You have to pick up the cabs from the main lobby and get dropped off there as well. I do like the Grand Mayan, but the service marred our trip and embarrassed us in front of our guests. The bugs and room change didn't help either. Who wants to go bug hunting every night? And when I say bugs I means dozens in each room! I would give this place a try again and maybe not check-in on a Saturday, but I'd go back to the Mayan at Nuevo Vallarta in a heartbeat first because the service was fantastic throughout our entire stay.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "babybeck", "Title": "\u201crelaxation\u201d", "Author": "babybeck", "ReviewID": "UR125467256", "Content": "I really enjoyed my stay.

The only 'negative' comments that I have are that the food quality is so-so, expecially given the cost of the meals. The buffets are generally good with excellent variety and many made-for-you items - but they, too, are somewhat costly. We don't generally eat at the buffets - and ate at the various restaurants on the grounds - where the food was fine, but felt costly. The on-site 'convenience store' makes very good and reasonably priced deli sandwiches - but the price for beverages, beer, etc. is far more expensive than if you take the shuttle into Playa del Carmen to the Walmart or MegaMart to stock-up on beverages, snacks, breakfast items, etc. All in all, the resort is very nice and we will go back. Even though it was near 'peak' period, the grounds are such that you don't feel crowded or overcome by the crowds at the pools, restaurants, beach, etc. As a suggestion, though, once you have found where you like to settle in for the day - like beach, Grand Mayan pool, infinity pools, etc - it is recommended that you get there about 9:30 to get a lounge chair and location that you want.

We got a good deal through Living Social. I've seen better deals on Living Social since our trip, so I'd check back there for the best prices. Anyway, we had a wonderful time at this non-all inclusive resort, located about 30 minutes south of the Cancun airport and 15 minutes north of Playa del Carmen. Pros: Rooms - We stayed in a one-bedroom suite on the second floor. I'd recommend being on the second or third floor if you want the most privacy while out on the balcony, which was quite large. The room itself was very clean and beautiful. Other people have said the beds are hard, but my wife and I didn't think they were too hard. The bathroom was large and well done. The kitchen had a stove, fridge and microwave - enough to cook if you want to, although we didn't. Pools - We had access to three of the four pools on the property. We only used the largest pool near the ocean. It was fantastic. We never felt crowded. We rented a palapa for shade. It cost about $30 US, but if you spent $30 US at the pool bar/restaurant the fee was waived. We had no problem spending that much. Service - Overall the service was great, especially the staff at the pool bar. You didn't have to leave your pool side chair/palapa in order to get drinks or food. A waiter would walk around and take your order. It was great. Food - There were several different restaurants available and we tried all of them. The quality ranged from applebees to higher end, depending on where you wanted to eat. We had to make reservations for the best two restaurants. The prices were typical of american restaurants. Spa - We got a couples massage. I recommend spending at least half a day at the spa/massage place. When you get a massage you have access to the spa facility, which offers a hot tub, swedish shower, steam room and sauna. Very nice. Money - You don't have to carry cash around. In fact, they won't accept it. Everything is charged to your room. They ask for your room number and name and that's it. I loved this fact, although it is easy to spend a lot when you don't see the money leaving your wallet. Cons: Beach - As stated before the beach is rocky. If you want to enter the ocean you pretty much have to have water shoes. I swam a couple days when the ocean was calm. If there are waves, good luck trying to navigate the rocks. Because the pools were so great, I didn't mind not swimming in the ocean. There is a nice beach to the south if you are willing to walk 15 minutes along the ocean. Walking - The resort is huge. We were given a room in building 13, which was the farthest away from the pools, beach and restaurants. We weren't able to move closer. It wasn't a big deal for us because we are young. It took about 10 minutes to walk to the pool from our building. If we didn't want to walk we waited for a golf cart to come pick us up. They came about every 10-15 minutes. Room service - We ordered a pizza after returning from a trip to the ruins. It literally took two hours to arrive. We were starving at that point. The pizza was cold. Overall: We had a great time and would come back if we found another good deal. The whole trip, including airfare, room, food and excursions cost about $2,800 US. We probably spent about $1,000 US on food and drinks while at the resort.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montville, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cUnbelievable Stay!\u201d", "Author": "traveler1683", "ReviewID": "UR125258502", "Content": "Just returned from a week long vacation here and had an amazing time! Words cannot express the unbelievable time we had as first timers here at this resort. First let me say that we used a timeshare for our stay, which was a 2 bedroom master suite. We had 2 rooms with both king size beds, kitchen with microwave, mini refrigerator, and stovetop (no oven). Our balcony also had a plunge pool, which was great to utilize here and there. Our room was quite large and it could easily fit 8-10 people. We were placed in building 9 after when we were checking in they tried to put us in building 12 oringally but after reading reviews on here we knew we didn\u2019t want to be that far. However our building was still quite a walk from the lobby and pools. We did walk it a few times and it took about 20 minutes. There are golf carts that are used as shuttles and are provided daily from 7am-11pm. At times we had to wait a few minutes either by our building or lobby and often the carts were full when we rode them but the resort seems to be working on the system to make it better because there were some flaws. Pools were fantastic. The Infiniti pool was beautiful with a beach like atmosphere where the lounge chairs were on sand but the pool was a bit cold so we opted to stay at the bigger pool. The pools were amazing with gorgeous grounds everywhere you looked and many chairs spread out. We did notice if you wanted a good spot near an umbrella it was best to be down at the pools by 930am. Whenever we would leave we made sure to put belongings on our chairs with our towels. We noticed many chairs were occupied with just towels and no one ever came to sit at them. Pool service was pretty good..shout out to Raul who we tried to sit on his side of the pool because he really did a great job. Happy hour was from 11am to 1pm and was double the size cups. The drinks were great and everyday there was a drink of the day. We also ordered lunch there everyday. As for the beach we didn\u2019t spend time there since the beach isn\u2019t in swimming conditions. We heard that the beach got destroyed a few years back due to the hurricanes that hit Mexico and why so much coral but were told they are working on rebuilding the beach. Although we would have loved to spend time on the beach the pools were beautiful and relaxing that we didn\u2019t mind and we also knew in advance about the beach. Food was also impressive. We ate at most of the restaurants on the premises. The Italian and Asian restaurant you had to make reservations but we had no problem getting the time and day we wanted. The Italian food was delicious and quite impressive since often when out of the US its not too good. The Asian restaurant was mostly sushi and if you like that it\u2019s a plus but the other options weren\u2019t so good. We also loved Havana Moon, which had quite a variety of food with a nice atmosphere and live music. We ate at Freidas the Mexican restaurant and it was decent but not our favorite compared to the other restaurants. We also ate at the breakfast buffet a few times which was good, your typical buffet nothing fantastic. The store in the hotel had a large variety of water,soda, snacks,cereal, and other misc foods to purchase and weren\u2019t that overpriced for being somewhere at of the country. Also just an FYI everything you buy wherever you are on the resort you must charge to your room. However upon checking out we asked for the bill to be split in half and charge it on two separate credit cards and it wasn\u2019t a problem at all. Spa: We also had hot stone massages at the spa which were 80minute massages for $130 it was great and relaxing! Safety: The security was pretty good at the resort and even when we went into town we felt safe. We took the taxi service that the hotel suggested and it was about $21 to get to town for a 20 minute ride. Excursions: We did the Tulum/Xel Ha tour. It was a very long day from 730am to 730 pm with transportation. We went to Tulum to see that Mayan ruins, which I recommend you do the morning tour b/c it was quite hot at 10 in the morning when we did it. Then we got to explore the beach of Tulum for a little before returning to the bus to head to Xel Ha. At Xel Ha was unlimited food (buffet style and the food was okay) and beverage. Snorkeling was included just had to put a deposit down and got it back once returned it and many other activities with an additional cost. We opted to pay additional cost for the sea trek, which was fun. Overall our trip at the resort was fantastic. Few pointers like many mentioned try to get in the closer buildings but if you can\u2019t not to worry there are shuttles. The timeshare bits are very true; they are hunters waiting for their prey. Before we even got online to check in someone approached us then immediately after we checked in there was a timeshare person waiting to approach us with a whole spiel. Even after we said we had a timeshare and weren\u2019t interested, they still called a few times to our room throughout our stay trying to get us to attend. They try to convince you that if you go on the tour you will get 10% off your bill and also a percentage off your excursions. All I can say is don\u2019t fall for it. Even if that is tempting it won\u2019t be worth you sitting in a presentation for hours and then they harass you many times throughout your stay. It seems awful what the people had to go through to decided to see what they had to say.

There is no reason to purchase a timeshare here when you are going to charge 9500 pesos a week for internet or 700 pesos an hour, 50 pesos per person to get a ride to Playa del Carmen and 120 per person to go to Cancun . . . each way. $15 USD per person for a ride back to the airport (the trip to their resort is free), 50 pesos for a bottle of water in your room when in fact it's for sale in Playa del Carmen for .80 USD, an average of 200 pesos per person for your lousy breakfast buffet, yogurt on your Room Service menu for 75 pesos when it's a trial size container of dannon yogurt which comes in a 6 pack and you split it up, coffee for 37 pesos for one cup of coffee and 100 pesos for a mixed drink and 60 pesos for a beer. All they do is charge, charge, charge you're account and then everyone tries to sell you a timeshare. I called room service one morning and the guy who answered the phone tried to sell me a timeshare. We were told the timeshare presentation would take 90 minutes and it took 4 hours. The only reason I agreed to do it is because they promised me 10% off my bill and a credit of 1200 pesos on my account, I'm waiting to see if they hold true to their word. After you meet with one of the sales people for the presentation, they keep pushing you to more and more aggresive sales people. They started off by saying that they would sell me a timeshare for $51,000 USD and then it went down to $11,000 USD can you say price gouging? You need a sign off for your giveaways before you leave so you can't leave until you've gone through the whole process. One of the aggresive sales managers actaully told me that they purposely stuck us in the last building (the resort is immense and can only be navigated through very slow trolleys) because we weren't owners there. The buildings are so poorly built that we thought our neighbors where in our room. We could hear their toast popping up from the toaster if that's any indication of how thin the walls are. The cleaning women are out at 6am cleaning the halls and banging up against the doors . . . no sleeping in on this vacation. I hope you have the same taste as the person next to you because you will be hearing their conversations and listening to their music amongst other personal happenings. The resort is very pretty but again very spread out. Put on your walking shoes or wait in the sweltering sun for a trolley to come every 20 minutes to your building to take you to the lobby. Suggestions for those who have already booked . . . Make sure you're room is not the \"hotel\" type but a suite. The \"hotel\" type has no refrigerator/kitchen/applicances so you're at the mercy of the hotel to purchase all of your meals. The prices are comparable to any major city so it's not a \"Mexican bargain\". If you have a suite, go directly to Playa del Carmen and purchase FOOD at Walmart. Purchase ALOT of food, drinks, beer, breakfast, lunch and dinner so you're not robbed blind in the restaurants. Bring sneakers because you'll be walking ALOT at this resort. Bring sunscreen, you don't want to have to buy it at the \"Market\" on the resort which charges over $20.00 USD for sunscreen. Suggestions if you're planning on booking here . . . look for another resort ~ DO NOT STAY HERE!

Might be a little long but it\u2019s your $ and mostly.....your vacation. Just got back from paradise and the family and I had a great time at The Grand Mayan in Playa del Carmen. This was our second time to this resort and this time it was much more enjoyable since it was June then (about 95 degrees) and our daughter is now 4 (much easier than the terrible 2's). Let me get to the fine points of the resorts: Grounds: Beautiful and Huge. Its about .80 miles long from entrance to beach and about .40 miles wide. So there's plenty of walking to do, but the walkways are filled with great plants/flowers, trees not to mention small wildlife so it makes the walks really enjoyable. Rooms: 2 Bedrooms with living and kitchen. Each bedroom has its own tub and shower, king bed, and a sofa that has a pull out bed for the kid(s). The living room also has two pull-out single beds for kids/adults. The kitchen has everything (cook top stove, door room size fridge which is about 4 feet tall, and microwave) but no dishwasher. Each room (as well as living) has access to the balcony which has a plunge pool. Our room was kept clean the entire time and we never came back to an \"unclean room\". Cons about Room: Beds are hard. I'm a very light/picky sleeper and prefer a soft pillow top bed so this may be irrelevant to many. Pull out beds are really not beds....just a soft 5 inch pad that slides out of the bottom of the couches. I combined two pads for my daughter to sleep on and she had no problems. Pools: If you are staying in The Grand Mayan portion of the resort you get to use two more pools than the Mayan Palace folks. Which are a lot better than and not as loud as the bigger pool. One of the two pools has a covered section so you can get out of the sun and get some shade. The other pool is a zero entry for the kiddos and is their version of the infinity pool overlooking the large lagoon. It also has a small beach section before the zero entry. The large pool is for all guests and is also nice and large. You have a pool to fit your mood for that day. Food/Drinks: Breakfast: We didn't eat any breakfast at the restaurants since we had food in the room and secondly I wasn't about to spend $17.50-$25 for a breakfast buffet which is what they had at all the restaurants. Tip: Save $ by buying cereal, eggs, bread and have that in room for breakfast.....unless you like wasting $$$ on breakfast. Lunch: When we were on property we ate while at the pools. The food was good (recommend the Fish Tacos) and held us over till Dinner Dinner: We ate at Gong one night and the sushi was awesome! For two of us with multiple drinks and 4 sushi rolls it was about $75. Other nights included Havana Moon which has live bands playing your favorite music and dance floor. Food was \"ok\"..we ordered Pizza so its hard to mess that up. We ordered room service a few nights since the kid crashed out early and that was pretty decent (for room service). Drinks: Its hard to mess up the beer portion, but they had \"drink of the day\" for discounted price. HAPPY HOUR ALERT: 11am-1pm everyday...2 for 1 so take advantage of it. Beer =$5 mixed drinks are about $10-12. THIS IS WHAT I DID ABOUT DRINKS: When in town at Playa load up on beer at Walmart (18 pack of Sol = $20). Look for a fold up cooler (SOL had 18pak and fold up cooler for $25) load that thing up with beer and ice take it down to the pool but wrap it up with a towel for they are not too keen on coolers at the pool (make sure its not glass). Order 2 orders of beer for happy hour (4 total) and ask for a few glasses with salt. Keep the glasses for \"your beer\" for the rest of the day at the pool and your daily total in beer costs is low. Beach: Just like the other reviews the beach section is rocky and getting into the ocean is virtually impossible. You'll have to go about 1/2 mile in both directions to get into ocean without fear of cutting up your feet. If you must go into ocean every single minute of your vacation than this resort is not for you. But if you like to get your feet wet and just sit on a chair on the beach then the beach is just fine. Golf: Jack Nicklaus design par 3 18 holes. $79 with clubs and cart. Fun course for the entire golfer...beginner or pro. I'm a 2 handicap and it\u2019s very challenging. Holes range from 100 yards to 295 (from back tees). If you\u2019re not on the green....you\u2019re in trouble. Timeshare Presentation: Don't know how, but I was never called, asked, bothered about doing anytime share....but just say no if you don't want to go. Fitness Center, Spa and Brio Health Bar: Very nice. My first time getting a message (couples message $150) so I can't compare other spas. Fitness center had everything you need to keep those beer calories off. I got a smoothie drink for my wife and about dropped it out of my hands when they told me the price ($9.50 for a small drink)...so didn't go back there. Employees/Security: All employees that I encountered we're nice full filed all of our requests. When entering and leaving the property they asked for our room numbers and wrote down taxi cab numbers and ask for the same when we returned. TIPS FOR YOUR STAY: Room: There really isn't any \"ocean views\" so don't worry about that just try to get a room in building 1-7 otherwise you'll be in the jungle and if you forget something at the pool/room its about a 30 minute round trip. If you have to lie about a physical condition and you can't walk that far or what not. You'll thank me once you see how far building 13 is. I know since I stay there 2 years ago.......ugh. Food and Drinks: To save $ load up at Walmart in Playa Transportation: -Email the concierge and let them know when you get in...free shuttle otherwise $45 taxi -Shuttle to Playa is about $5/person Google Earth: To get an idea of how big the resort is and what it all has, get on Google earth type in Hotel Mayan Palace Riviera Maya I've been to all Grand Mayan's except for Cabo. This one and Nuevo Vallarta are pretty much tied in my book. Would I go back....yes. Will I?....yes.

Also, groceries were hard to come by and expensive. The resort is huge, with great pools, bars and restaurants, but unless you're in the central area, every excursion requires waiting for a shuttle or walking a distance. If you stay in a one-bedroom lock off, you won't even be able to make a pot of coffee (though room service is available for a price). Puerto Morelos, a nearby fishing village, was a quick taxi ride worth making, if only for the wonderful ceviche at Los Pelicanos. The grocery is limited and expensive, but we enjoyed bargaining a little on the high-priced handcrafts in the local shops. Playa del Carmen is a little longer trip, cheaper by collectivo than by taxi, with long crowded beaches and lots of shopping and eating opportunities and a Walmart for groceries. Much more touristy than Puerto Morelos, but still laid-back. All in all, very relaxing with beautiful facilities, but ample opportunities for off-resort excursions.

This by a long shot is the prettiest of them all! The grounds and the pool areas are magnificient. I know hotels always like to tell you how full they are, so this past week it was 92% . True or not, there were four lounges for every person both at the beach and the pools. The rooms were adequate, clean and bright. Concierge service was very helpful. They say you have to make reservations for dinner, but in fact, you can get in almost any of them when you want. As in a lot of restaurants in Mexico hotels, they try to be something they are not. The Asian/Fusion restaurant was disappointing because of the lack of choice of true Asian dishes. They had some interesting Fusion dishes, but most were strange combinations, and overall a little pricy for value received. (four small potstickers, $11 US) The place is HUGE, and you will do a lot of walking. We requested to be in a building closer to the center, buildings1-4, as many have suggested, weeks in advance, and the request was not met. So as a warning, if you have any problem with walking, or kids that are younger but out of a stroller, be prepared! Access to the water at the beach is difficult because of the rocks and the red warning flag was flying all week, but the beach itself was very peaceful. The restaurants were generally adequate, nothing outstanding. It would have been nice to have more than a third of a glass of red wine for $9, considering in was not even mid grade vintage. The pool bar drinks were more than adequate, and especially during happy hours, very reasonably priced. Three of the dinners we went to were theme buffets, and not that good at all. The presentation was a bit sloppy, and the quality was only fair. Surf and turf buffet night had no shrimp when we arrived, and the line waiting for steak was 20 minutes long because they had one cook for about 200 patrons. Don't even think about lobster or scallops, they do not exist. The steamer trays were filled with cold food...pretty much a disaster for Valentine's Day. Interesting is the difference in service between here and all-inclusives. Buffet waiters have little to do but take plates away and refill coffee, especially at breakfast and that was lacking during many meals. Might just be they get 15% that is automatcally added to your bill. BUT...service was almost always with a smile, and most tried very hard, as with the rest of the personnel. Would I return? Only if I see that there were improvements in the restaurants, because while you can go into town, by and large you are a captive audience. I will say that my wife and I, not being big drinkers, spent about half that we would have at an all-inclusive for the meal portion of the tab.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carrickfergus, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA LITTLE PIECE OF HEAVEN\u201d", "Author": "209947Traveller", "ReviewID": "UR124730327", "Content": "ideal for couples who prefer quiteness,good food,politeness of staff,beautiful surrounds,beaches. use local bus to porta del carmen to fifth ave pleanty of shops cafes local culture.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "swan lake mb canada", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute luxury\u201d", "Author": "gdesmond61", "ReviewID": "UR124685995", "Content": "We stayed a week on a timeshare swap, so was affordable for us.

They only have a couple of buildings that are very close to the pool/food area.

The water at the beach has a coral/rocky bottom which can be treacherous. I managed to swim in it while wearing my sandals. The beach sand at the water\u2019s edge is not very pretty because they have tried to bring sand to the beach and to keep the sand in place and they have sand bags which are busted/showing.

I've heard many complaints about walking but was lucky enough to stay in a close room. The resort is BEAUTIFUL! Staff is very friendly,but not always efficient.

We also ate outside the resort. My mom go sick briefly but me and my sister didn't. The good: -beautiful resort -nice beach with beautiful view ( wouldn't recommend swimming though) -friendly staff -decent location (near Playa del Carmen, and some major ruins) -big, spacious, clean rooms -well manicured grounds -lots to explore and see (flamingos, crocodiles, jungle, pools, beach etc.) -pretty good food -WARM pools (which I like) -fun activities to enjoy or just watch -seemingly lots of activities for kids like the Poole that's huge, crafts, movie at night, and little tidal pools by the sea( would recommend water shoes for that) The bad: (as much as I hate to say it) -VERY thin walls!!!! (Had very loud neighbors,and maids are pretty loud) -can't really swim on the beach -if you want to sleep in don't come here if you want to sleep in and be perfectly quiet relaxation, (it wasn't overly loud at all, and I'm sensitive, but some parts can be quite busy in the heat of the day.) -scattered information from the still very helpful concierge -ordered nachos pool side and it took almost two hours -NO hot tubs on property -don't ask for a room by the pool because every night the play a movie loudly for kids. Major tips for the area: -go into Playa del Carmen(15 min. Drive) and go to 5th avenue for a fun atmosphere that reminded me of kona Hawaii and had both dining and shopping, and some nightlife if your into it. -there is a Walmart in Playa to buy waters etc. -if you want to snorkel I would NOT recommend akumal because people really push it and I spent hours snorkelling and all I saw was a turtle and some gray fish, not worth it for snorkelling. But a nice beachswim. -bring some bug spray we got she bug bites -*close balcony doors as soon as it gets dark or you'll have a mosquito problem ***the ruins:*** -we decided to rent a car because we didn't want to spend 100 dollars per person to sit on a tour bus for hours and only see one ruin in a day. -the drive to the rooms varies from 1-3 hours. -driving is a little freaky in Mexico but the drive is pretty much just a straight shot and we had nooo problem. -if you want to climb ruins I would recommend Coba (1 hr 45 mins if you drive) there was not that many people there and it has one of the tallest Mayan ruins that if you climb to the top has breath taking ruins!!!! -tulum is about an hour away if you drive and is beautiful on the Caribbean and even has a beach for yu to swim on but you can't go up to close to the rooms because its so manicured and regulated, but would recommend because is beautiful. -**also if you want to see two ruins in one day I would recommend Coba then tulum, but only if you drive (that was plennnnttyy of time for us) even though the close at five, if you take a tour bus you have to stay in giant groups the whole time and move at their pace! - Coba was my favorite because it was pretty empty and in the jungley area. -*wouldn't recommend chichen itza because its SUPER busy (so I've heard), masses of people Hopes this helps!", "Date": "February 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "The ends of the Earth", "Title": "\u201cGreat Resort\u201d", "Author": "tell1er", "ReviewID": "UR124547133", "Content": "Just returned from the Grand Mayan in Rivirea Maya.

A few things that concerned us were: 1) Brio, the gym now charges a fee for its use. This is a new fee that should not be charged. The gym equipment there is showing its age, particularly the spin bikes (only 2 of the 8 or so are rideable...there is no more spin classes). 2) The number of social activities has declined a lot. 3) The drinks at the various bars (swim-up, etc.) are a bit \"thin\".

BTW, we did not take them up on the \"sell-a-thon\" Losing 3 hours of vacation time for a condo sale is not the $1000/peso-1/3rd off deal.

We did stay in a building that was close to all the amenities so we did not feel that the resort was too spread out. This resort is the best combination of a luxury resort and timeshare resort. You have the large rooms with a kitchen as well as gorgeous amenities and restaurants. You can buy your own groceries and spend very little on eating out or eat out every meal and never cook. We did a combination of that and were really surprised at how little our bill came to at the end. The service all around was fantastic. All the staff were really helpful and seemed genuinely nice. My 6 year old came down with an ear infection at 5 in the morning. I was particularly impressed when they sent transportation to take us to the doctor (on property), 2 buildings away, as it was raining. The doctor was excellent and had all the medication on hand. The staff for the kids activities was fantastic - especially Denise at the Grand Mayan pool. Room service was excellent and included a turn down service during which the kids beds would be made up and towels were refreshed. Things to know: - free shuttle from airport to hotel (book with concierge ahead of time) but you pay for the transportation returning to the airport - crocodiles get fed every two weeks so ask which day is feeding day - flamingos are let out of their shelter to be viewed after 9am - happy hour drinks (double the size frozen drinks and 2 for 1 beers) served from 11-1 at the pools and 1-3 at the golf restaurant - cashless resort but the doctor requires cash payment and if you need to pay for anything after you check out you can pay with cash or credit card - not all restaurants are open every night. Call the concierge to find out. Make a reservation for the Italian restaurant ahead of time. -during the week we were there there were scheduled kids activities for kids at the pools all through the day but no actual drop off kids club. I am guessing this changes during school vacation periods -there is no charge for palapas at the Grand Mayan sanctuary pool but at the huge Mayan pool there is a $30 charge for palapas that is offset against lunch/drinks charges when you check out. - the gym is free to Grand Mayan guests and is really nice - there is no oven in the kitchen - the fridge is a good size but the freezer is quite small - a service charge is included in every bill.There is no place to add an additional tip so bring cash if you like to do that We thought this vacation was unbelievable value for a family of 4 and will definitely be returning, hopefully for 2 weeks next time.", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayzata", "Title": "\u201cGrand Mayan with Kids\u201d", "Author": "cfran123", "ReviewID": "UR124355194", "Content": "We stayed in a one BR in Building One with our two kids, ages 5 and 9.

We rented the $30 palapa almost every day (credied back in food and beverage) and spent all of our time at the pools. The ocean was very rough, rocky and not swimmable, esp for kids. The flamingos are fun to watch and the alligators are very cool, worth finding them to see in person... We did room service for dinner a few times, pizza and fajitas, all were very good and reasonably priced. A cab ride over to Wal-mart is a must (esp with kids) to stock up on breakfast food and beer/wine etc). Drinks were expensive which got annoyng, the 11-1 happy hour (2x1) was just a larger serving of each drink, didn't seem like an awesome deal. We ate in the restaurants on the property most nights and had lunch/drinks at the pools. We ended up spending about 150-200 per day, not bad. The Mexican buffet and show (Thursday night) was wonderful - great singing, dancing and acrobatics, and kid appropriate. They have a kids club where they watch the kids and do activities. Our kids did some of the activities (bead making, tissue paper flowers etc) but I didn't feel comfortable leaving them with the staff. The staff were very nice but didn't speak too much English and the overall supervision seemed a bit lax (I observed some kids wandering away going back to find their parents which made me nervous)...

Our vacation time was between 1/21/12/ to 2/2/12. Here are the pluses and minuses to my vacation at the Grand Mayan. Pluses: -Beautiful weather(80-90 degrees) with humidity -Aesthetics of the property were above average -If you have Grand Mayan and up level you have the use of the gym and most pools -rooms were above average -great customer service Minuses: -If you have a 1 bedroom, the studio next door which is separated by only a door can get very noisy. When they built this design I don't think they put in a sound proof door. Big mistake. I could hear people taking a shower, talking, opening their luggage. I could almost hear what they were watching on T.V. word for word. Really bad if you have people who are there that plan on making a party of it. -poor choices in kitchen supplies(pots, pans, etc.) -biting knats, don't see ums, or bed bugs. Every night I had difficulties sleeping due to something biting me. -poor night life. If your not married or younger than 16 than this place is not going to have the night life you want. What it has for night life: Havana Moon has music, but on a typical night there was between 10-15 people; there is no sports bar atmosphere; limited night activities. The activities seem to be concentrated on children between ages of 12-16. -You are a captive audience and they'll let you know it through the prices of food and alcohol. For dinner expect to pay above $30 at buffet; above $60 at fine dining restaurants; and above $25 for mexican dinner at pool side restaurant. For drinks: happy hour(only 2 hours at pool) figure $3.00 for mexican beer and double drinks for $10.00-$12.00 per drink. Non-happy hour: $5.00 for mexican beer and drinks for $10.00-$12.00 per drink. OUTRAGEOUS! -Trip to Playa is $5.00 per person and is every 2 hours up until 9pm. Kind of inconvenient; taxi from the lobby is 250 pesos or $20-$25 per ride one way. Expensive if you care about having a night life; taxi from street (outside resort) this actually was a deal. You can take a shuttle cart from lobby to main entrance and walk out of the main gate to the street. While out on the street just put your thumb up and most likely within 5-10 minutes you'll have a taxi stop to pick you up. The cost of the street taxi is between 100 pesos to 150 pesos one way; the other option is the city bus which is only 25 pesos per person, but is inconvenient because you don't know when your going to see it and there is no bus stop. -the beach SUCKS! You won't swim there. From the shore line out there is sharp dead coral or rock. I love swimming in the ocean, but would not swim there. -all payable activities are expensive. With all the money that they tried to get out of me. It left me saying \"Aren't I in Mexico\", \"Aren't we in a bad economy right now.\" Well with the prices their charging you wouldn't think so. The best bet under these circumstances would be to do an all-inclusive. Personally, I'll stick to Cabo San Lucas where you can walk into town to have many choices on restaurants and bars; you can wheel and deal on just about everything and most importantly you can get a MEXICAN beer for under $2.00.

The Grand Mayan comes out on top. It has a land and beach area that surpasses the other two... combined. You'll read that the beach is not great, that it is rocky. Yes, it is, but there are nearby beaches that are all sand. The sun, shade, lounge chairs, and cleanliness made relaxing by the beach a dream. You'll read that some units are too far away from the pools and beach. Seriously, if you are not comfortable walking that is something to consider but if you enjoy walking or just want to get some exercise, then you'll be in a great place here. My wife and I enjoyed our walks from our unit (11 in the Jungle) to the beach, around the pools, and exploring. The 2-bedroom unit is massive and daily service and cleanliness fantastic. You do need to be quiet in the halls and in your room because sound carries really, really well everywhere. The restaurants are not really that expensive and the food is quite good. The happy hour deals are not all that great, but it's better than buying half the drink at full price. Try the Mud Slide or the Long Beach... awesome. Water aerobics were a blast, even for the guys. Two things you absolutely, positively MUST do: 1. Go to the Mexican Festival on Thursday night. My wife and I had differing opinions on the food, but the show is not to be missed. 2. Guys, splurge and treat your wife to a most special Romantic Dinner out on the pier. Yes, there is a $100 cover charge, but you can split that with one or two other couples. The food is from the Havana Restaurant and it is simply outstanding. Fantastic location, great service, awesome rooms, beautiful beach. If you rent a car, WATCH OUT FOR THE SPEED BUMPS.

WE stayed in Building 4 in a one bedroom which was clean spacious and well appointed. A 50 MCX Peso tip each day kept it immaculate for us. Very nice property with awesome multi level pools and several swim up pool bars. No fighting for pool chairs here, there are plenty to go around. We rented a Palapa shade bed most days for about $30. Lots of those to go around as well. Any drinks or food orders are credited back up to the value of the Palapa. So if you order lunch from the pool waiter and a couple of drinks during the 11-1 \"double size\" happy hour, your palapa is free for the day. My wife had a tequila foot massage from the spa Brio right at her Palapa for a good deal. Then another day we had twin 30 minute massages in a private beach cabana for $74 plus tip, another special. Ask for Rubi or Alicia. The beach on the property is OK but you cannot swim in the water unless you have water shoes as it is a rocky bottom. I walked the beach several days both ways and it has nice beaches, if you go left for about 1/4 mile and a ways towards the right. Recommendations: The \"Classic\" trip to Chichen Itza book through the hotel is excellent. It is operated by Cancun Bay. We had Victor as a guide and he spoke excellent english and was a wealth of knowledge. This was our best excursion by far. We also spent part of a day in Playa Del Carmen. It is quaint, nice beach there as well. if you go to Playa, try dinner at Los Amigos for excellent cheap local mexican cusine, Outstanding enchiladas and burritos. We stuffed ourselves and had two beer each for $30 plus tip. XCaret was good too, and the night show was fabulous. If you go to Chichen Itza and Xcaret both, try to go to Chichen Itza first, you will see why. The best show at the resort is the Mexican show on Thursday nights at Del Lago restaurant. It was excellent and included all you can eat buffet and drinks for about $30 per person. The crab and scallop burger at Blue Ocean was very good.This is a cashless resort, which works well. There is a store on site which is a bit expensive, a trip to Playa to the grocery store will get you most nessecities for a lot less. The few complaints we had; 1) the hotel would not make change dollar for dollar. The will exchange currency of course for a fee. So bring small bills for minor expenditures and or tips. 2) Bell hop service was poor, they don't seem to care about customer service.

You can plan a trip here, since it isnt all inclusive, and still save money by getting groceries and maybe a soft pillow from Playa del Carmen (20-30 minutes depending). The beach is still beautiful even though it is rocky. I personally would rather be at the pool with the music, pool bars, and beautiful pools. I was very impressed with the pools here, there are three main areas, one for guests staying at the Mayan Palace and Grand Mayan, and the other two smaller ones are for the Grand Mayan guests. I honestly loved all of them, the one smaller one with sand did however seem more oriented to children, which is great but we dont yet have any! The service of all of the workers here is great, everyone is very helpful with questions, problems in your room, etc. They even gave us a fridge, all you have to do is ask and they will literally take care of it for you within 30 minutes.

Overall the food was really good, but a little expensive. Adding also, the gym was really nice, i was impressed with the equipment and the variety. They have tread mills, spinning bikes, ellipticals, lifting equipment, and also yoga and pilates classes almost every day. My boyfriend and I went 5 out of the 7 days (around 7-9am it was busy and sometimes you had to wait for treadmill/elliptical). Overall this resort was really nice.

We were there with our 2 girls age 7 and 4. We cant say enough good things about our trip. First of all we were very lucky to have amazing weather for the whole 7 days we were there which was uncommon. When we checked in we were actually booked in The Grand Mayan, in the 1 bedroom suite. We were told we would be put in building 12, which after reading all the previous emails we knew would be a far walk. After begging for a closer building, they offered to upgrade us to a 2 bedroom in the Mayan Palace building 4. We decided after looking at the property map that we should take the option in the Mayan Palace. He explained that the rooms had the same accomodations, kitchenette etc. The only difference being Mayan Palace is older and there for, less luxurious. No granet counter tops...older carribbean style instead of the newer modern look of the Grand Mayan. Also no plunge pool on the smaller balconies, which we didn't mind because traveling with small children we were very nervous to have that so close. To be honest when we got to the room we were disappointed, BUT by day 2 we were thrilled to be so close to pools, deli/market. We were also given bracelets to have access to Grand Mayan pool which were more private and secluded compared to the gigantic mayan palace pool. We sat at the Grand Mayan pool every day. Our kids loved it because of the beach feel with the sand and infinity pool. Also the kids club was right at that pool, which was AMAZING! Our kids would visit back and forth for face painting, beaded bracelets, & make pinatas. They also had pirate party and mini olympics. It was very age appropriate for our girls. At night, they had kids movies, on an outdoor movie screen, bingo, and kareoke. it was a great family trip. The only negatives I would say, are: the beach. You cant get into the ocean from their beach because of all rocks & coral at the waters edge. The beds and pillows, hard like a rock A/C in the bedroom. No matter what we did , we couldnt get it right. We froze, til we were forced to turn off completly and had to turn off. Woke up again from hot and humid early in the morning. Other than that I would say do whatever you can to be in a low number building. Although our friends were in bldng 8, Grand Mayan, and were thrilled too.

It was a beautiful, tropical, windey walk to the pools (close enough but not too close - be sure to request buildings 1-6). Unbelievable pools - our kids, in particular, loved the \"kid-friendly\" pools with a sandy poolside! Activities for kids and adults throughout the day make it a lot of fun. Take advantage of Happy Hour and order a \"skinny Margarita\" (sans the extra sugar). The rooms are well-insulated - very quiet and the kitchen & rooms are well-equipped with every amenity that you need. Cleaning staff is thorough and visits twice per day! All staff were friendly and always helpful. BTW, bring dollar bills as little tips and it will get you far ... We rented a car which we couldn't recommend more for shopping trips to Playa del Carmen. Saves you time and money in the long run - e.g. use on excursions vs. taking the big tour buses. Shopped for breakfast, lunch, snacks & alcohol at the Walmart and Mega supermarket in Playa del Carmen - and had our own \"cocktail hour\" on our balcony. The restaurants are \"reasonably priced\" relative to New York prices but a bit on the high side in comparison to restaurants in Playa, but the food was excellent. Our favorite was Havana Grill, an oceanside restaurant on the premisis with beautiful ambiance and excellent quality food. The hotel gift shop was very impressive - every amenity available at reasonable prices and includes a mini-market with fresh food and sundries. Next to the gift shop is a nice arcade that's good for a rainy day (extra cost to play games though, naturally). If you like to veg at the hotel, you'll love it here. The beach is rocky and a disappointment but there are plenty of nearby beaches if you like to swim or have that need to hang at the white sandy beaches seen in Caribbean commercials. If you like to do excursions, it's a little bit of work on your part but again, rent a car and you'll be happy that you did.

The Grand mayan and Grand Luxxe pools are also stunning but much quieter. Goes with the higher end crowd, I guess. Not all guests are allowed at all pools. The beach is really rocky but the best section is near the grand luxxe pools. We ended up at the pools most of the time. Our rooms were equipped with kitchens but the fridges are small and there is no oven, just a stove top and a microwave. We hired a car and made a trip to Playa del Carmen for groceries and alcohol. Lots of effort but we enjoy cooking and saving money. One of our party trained as a chef so we still ate well. The food on the resort is not outrageously priced but it can add up. The resort runs a shuttle that goes to Playa del Carmen regularly throughout the day for 50 pesos. Highly recommend a trip there. Playa has a nicer beach and is a vibrant working town although its a little touristy. The rooms are spacious and clean. Our 2 rooms could sleep up to 12-14 people easy. The balcony had a splash pool which we utilized a lot while we had drinks outside. Many activities are available. The resort guide details them all but we only attended a couple of shows and a beach party. The shows were very good for resort shows. There is a fully equipped gym that has everything. Its open early but gets pretty busy at 8am. You may have to wait for a treadmill or eliptical at this time but later in the day, its empty. There are yoga and pilates classes as well. I did not attend any but they were full when I was there each morning. Free fast wifi was excellent. I don't know if this is free for everyone but the owner of the time share units said it was included for us. Overall, this was one of the best family vacations we've ever had.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Rogers, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cCan't wait to go back!\u201d", "Author": "kris0474", "ReviewID": "UR123470290", "Content": "My husband & I stayed at the Grand Mayan for one week beginning Jan. 13, 2012. It was beautiful! When we arrived, per other reviews on this site, we asked to be in a building near the pool area and we were given a room in Building 1 on the second floor. We were never bothered by any noise. The rooms have a fan that stays on constantly and provides great \"white noise\" while sleeping. We had at least 8 large bath towels at all times and the \"night\" chambermaids come around in the evenings to see if you need any fresh towels, soap, etc. My only complaint about the room is that the bed is very firm and there was no coffee pot. (we did not have a room with a kitchen) The staff is very service oriented, prompt when you need anything, and friendly. There are many restaurants to choose from, the food & drinks are fabulous! Poolside, they have \"Happy Hour\" everyday from 11am-1pm with 2 for 1 drinks and also everyday the \"Drink of the Day\" is 2 for 1 all day, but you have to ask what it is. There are many covered poolside \"beds\" with sheets & pillows that you can reserve for $30 per day but if you order food & drinks in that amount, the bed is free. The beach was much better than I had anticipated after reading some other reviews here. The water is much rougher than in the Cancun area and the beach not as pristine, but there is plenty of sand and chairs to relax on the beach....also one of the pools has a sandy \"beach\" area. The hotel runs on a \"no-cash\" basis; everything from food, drinks, spa services & gift shop items are charged to your room and you settle up in the end. we kept every receipt and went over the bill as we waited at the airport to leave and everything added up perfectly so their system really works and it's very convenient to not have to carry cash all over the resort.

We declined the all- inclusive(AI) this time because my drinking days are now behind me because of some new medical issues. But ordinarily, AI is definitely the way to go if you like to drink. As members we get to go to any of the Grand Mayan locations we'd like. They're all pretty much the same. My only two displeasures with this spot is 1.) It's situated too far from most attractions. There is no small quaint village to wander off into. Playa del Carmen itself is a really cool, quaint little Mexican town though, but it is a cab or shuttle ride away. Inspite of this, it is definitelyworth the trip. And 2.) The beach was a mess. But in all fairness Hurricane Irene had blown through just a few days prior. The Xcaret excursion was a disappointment, especially for the money. Its \"save the environment\" theme is noble, but it fell way short on entertainment for us slightly older folks.

We booked about one month ahead. (In high-demand seasons, check right before the 30-day no-cost cancellation time if you haven't found anything earlier.) The resort is beautiful, well-run, efficient, with good food even at the causal restaurants. The Mayan Palace and Grand Mayan are on the same property and can use most of the same pools and facilities, with a few exceptions that are clearly marked. There is an 18-hole par 3 course on the grounds, costing $75 USD for one round with cart and rental clubs. We were in one of the suites (with one king bedroom and two couches, a kitchen but with only a cooktop and microwave) in Building 1, which is the closest building to the lobby and pool. The \"jungle\" sections of both resort areas are quite far from the pool, beach, and restaurants, but there is a golf cart shuttle that runs every 15-20 minutes. You can walk it in about the same amount of time. You can avoid the timeshare sales sharks that other reviewers mentioned pretty easily. When the sales booking people approach you right after check-in, just say that you haven't decided what you are going to do yet, so you can't sign up for any specific date/time. They will check back with you later in the week, at which time you can just say that you already have plans and can't fit in the breakfast/sales pitch. You will also hear about the promo prices for the tours, and how much it can save you. You have to decide whether the 4 hours (not 90 minutes) and the aggravation are worth the savings. The food at the restaurants is very good, but some of it is rather pricey. However, it is convenient. Take advantage of the happy hour prices to help cut prices on the drinks (which are pretty reasonable to start with anyway). There are a lot of good resturant choices in Playa del Carmen, about a 20 minute taxi/shuttle ride away. The hotel shuttle is 100 pesos per person round trip. We went into town one night and had a very nice meal at Ajua! Maya (separately reviewed), plus did some shopping and walked on the beach. We recommend that you skip the Mexican Fiesta. The food is good with wide variety, there is an open bar (with lousy drinks and slow service), but it's really too expensive. The show runs for about 2-3 hours, but the first half of it (a bad mariachi band and cheesy audience participation) is pretty lame. We almost left. but then it improved quite a bit, but still not worth the money. One thing to watch: activities that are priced in USD (such as the diving) are converted to pesos before being added to your bill. Then you have to convert back to USD on your credit card to pay the bill. I haven't done the calculation yet, but there is a chance you will pay several percent more than you should. The resort has a no-cash policy, so all charges for food, drinks, and activities get put onto your room bill. For travel arrangements, there is an on-site travel desk. They will claim that they are the only way to book a tour and have the transportation pick you up inside the resort. However, I suspect that they have no way to know if you book something like Xcaret, Xel-Ha, or Alltournative tours directly. These companies come in to pick up people every day, so they will be there anyway, and we saw some people holding different vouchers who were picked up with no problem. There is a free shuttle to the resort that you can book in advance with 48 hour notice. The shuttle back to the airport costs $15 USD per person. Despite what they tell you, it only took us 30-40 minutes to get from the resort to the airport. When you get to the airport, walk past all of the vultures inside the building and go outside. They will try to get your attention. Don't make eye contact. Do not let them convince you that they can transport you or provide you with anything that you want! Would we go back? Well, yes and no. It was a good vacation, but rather expensive and with limited choices. It looks like the other Grand Mayan and Mayan Palace locations we have visited. It is safe, controlled, and not risky at all. The staff speaks English and is very friendly and accommodating. There are a lot of activities available, most at extra cost. However, if you crave adventure or some excitement, you will have to leave the resort and go into Playa or Cancun (which is really too far away to be practical).", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Clifton,VA", "Title": "\u201cLooking forward to going back again soon!!\u201d", "Author": "julesClifton_VA", "ReviewID": "UR123127385", "Content": "Traveled with my husband, and 4 kids 23,21,11,and 8.

Bathroom still had double sinks, a whirlpool tub, and a nice big shower. What they lack in beach they make up for in pools. Truly a ridiculous amount of pools and remarkable that they are kept so clean. However if you do need some more beach, if you go around the corner over rocks through the water, there is a pretty non-crowded stretch of beach where a few other resorts are located. We went running down the beach a couple mornings. We avoided the timeshares by just not answering the phone and not scheduling at check-in. They change their story with each offer (a breakfast for RCI members, promotional tour, complementary tour to see the grounds). However, 10% off for the week and 1000 pesos was a tempting offer and might have been enough to get me there if we had stayed the full week, rather than 5 days. Requested a building between 1-7, and luckily got our room in building 4. Can't imagine being further out. On one attempt to explore the grounds, I couldn't even find my way to the higher number buildings. Only a few complaints: -We didn't really know about the shows that were going on while we were there unless we happened to hear them when we were walking by. -A phone call at 7:40 AM about the time share meeting.

Still annoyed they would call that early. -Toilet handle in the room had to be held down to flush -Pretty firm bed Overall, beautiful grounds, friendly service, fantastic pools, definitely a good trip.

Pros: beautiful room - there were five of us in the Grand Mayan suite which consisted of a studio room with a Queen bed attached to a master suite, another queen size bed. There are couches that one can turn into a single bed with a trundle underneath each couch, making it possible to sleep ten. The pools were clean and more importantly we felt safe having our kids wonder around on their own (ages range from 10 - 14) as they were many staff around and lots of security. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful although tips are continuously expected. On the Con side: there is no beach to speak of, we were told that the the beach was hit twice by a hurricane and the sand was blown into the sea. As a result what is left is very rocky and not that nice. The kids loved it none the less as there was quite a bit of fish life in the shallow waters. The food was expensive and not up to the same level as it was when we visited a previous Mayan resort in Acapulco, two years ago. Also we suffered through an interminable time share presentation asking us to upgrade our membership with the salespersons getting increasingly unfriendly when we continued to refuse. Avoid these presentations at all costs if possible although they do tempt you by offering you one of the local tours for a very low price. All in all, the kids had a good time and Playa del Carmen is not far from the resort, about a 20 minute cab or shuttle ride.

Enormous property, beautiful pools, trees abound, gardens, pathways, delicious food, lovely. All of this becomes pointless because there is a serious scam going on at this property with the pirannha sales staff, and that is the nicest word I can find to describe them. I will NEVER stay here again. The moment you arrive, no time is wasted in asking you to attend a 90 minute presentation. We were offered a free breakfast, $250.00 dollars off of our Hertz car rental and two tickets entry into Chichen Itza. We thought...90 minutes sure seems reasonable. And they clearly tell you, \"No obligation. If you're not interested, no problem. We just want you to hear our offer. If you don't like it, you are free to walk away.\" The initial sales person who starts the pitch is friendly, amicable. We were somewhat rushed through breakfast, but we figured, ok, they want to get to the 90 minute presentation and get it started. I gave the company the benefit of the doubt. After the sales person finished his pitch of trying to get us to pay $53,000 (USD) for a 2 bedroom unit and we said \"no\" - then he sent in his 'closer' to whom we also said no. This ordeal, and that's what it was, because they do not take 'no' for an answer, last more than FOUR HOURS. Folks, all I can say is that in hindsight, we've done the math and this is a scam of major proportions. First the sales person who is super friendly, then the 'financial closer' takes a chance at it and he's not quite as friendly, then if you're still saying no, the goon squad comes in. Two guys that try their best to intimate you, and rather agressively I might add. They are not so friendly. Being two New Yorkers, my husband and I were not intimidated but rather started getting angry because we kept saying \"no\" - but I could see how many people might become so intimidated they would just say, \"yes!\" You might become so exhausted, so frustrated, that you might say, \"OK, I'll buy it. Just leave me alone and let me leave!\" We said no and demanded that we be allowed to leave. Because you might not be familiar with the property (and it's huge), you might not know where the exit doors are or where to go even if you do get our of the exit doors. These pirannhas depend on your exhaustion, your fear, all in an effort to scam you. Here's the scam, they start by telling you that the concept was developed at Stanford. So you think \"Oooh...an American ivy league institution. It must be legitimate.\" For the price of $53,000 (USD - payment over 5 years plus 10% interest), you basically pay for I don't know what! And I say that because you don't own (you don't get a deed) and you still have to pay $800 annually for the next 100 years. So what are you giving them $53,000 for? You can also continue it past 100 years to your children but you don't own a thing so what are you passing on exactly? You are basically passing along the annual maintenance fee due. Additionally, you are asked to put down between $4,000 to $5,000.00 USD (this is what they are really after, the down payment because if you default later or if they go out of business later at least they got their down payment out of you). Sound like a good deal? Well, not when you consider that after you have paid both the 53k and the 4-5k, you continue to pay $800 annually. And then, there's another $1,200.00 USD every five years to 'upkeep' the furniture. Folks, you can take this all of this money that you would give to them and go buy a condo in Florida right now and own it outright. Most folks may not be able to do the math right away because of the pressure they put on you to decide now now now! This is a lot of money to give away without giving it a lot of thought and consideration...that's where the pressure comes in. Any legitimate realtor would never make you decide on the spot. You would have ample opportunity to research the company, their financial holdings, etc. Who at Stamford created this? Would you ever give away so much money before you've had the chance to look into who it is exactly that you are doing business with? These are the clear markers of a scam, a con game in progress. At the end of it all, we got our Hertz discount in cash, we got our Chichen Itza entry in cash, and we did not purchase a thing. Was it worth it?

We fell in love with the place 4 years ago and have been there 4 times already. Our sons love the place as well, and look forward to go back again. We already own a couple of timeshares, so the first thing we asked the receptionist was to warn all sales people not to call us or even try to contact us. We did get a couple of early calls (800 a.m.! ) twice and politely asked the caller not to call at all. Simple. We were never bothered again. So, focusing on the hotel: there is a lot of walking, which we absolutely enjoy - because the paths are lush with vegetation, flowers, exotic birds and even crocodiles swimming in a pond. Of course, if you don't like walking you can always take the golf cart that goes around the complex every 15 minutes or so. There are many pools scattered all over, in different locations to suit everyone's choice, including a bar in the largest one. Waiters come and go all the time, eager to take your order and they also have Happy Hours offering two drinks for the price of one. The waiters are very polite and friendly, and the food is simply delicious. The beach is not very user friendly, it's loaded with rocks, but just sitting by the sand next to the ocean is very relaxing. We usually take the full apartment with 2 bedrooms, and have always found the beds to be very comfortable. The place is always clean, the kitchen is very useful and perhaps the only thing is that you need to wash the dishes yourself - there is no dishwasher. Since we never take the all inclusive plans, we are free to either have breakfast at the apartment, or at any restaurant at the hotel that offers breakfast. We have also gone early to Playa El Carmen or Puerto Morelos to have \"typical breakfasts\" at the low-end local eateries. It's really worth it. The restaurants at the Grand Mayan are a bit pricey, but the attention and the food are quite good. They have shows every night, and you can also dance between shows. The best part is after dinner: just walking around the hotel under the starry skies is breathtaking! We always rent a vehicle, in order to explore around. We usually go to Walmart at Playa El Carmen to stock up on food and drinks early on. Exploring the famous Calle 5 is quite interesting. You will find all kinds of restaurants and shops, and of course, many street vendors offering typical crafts and arts. Parking your car near Calle 5 is a bit tricky, but if you arrive before 6:00 p.m. you might find a spot. Be prepared when you walk, you will be approached by all kinds of vendors, some quite aggressive. We also recommend visiting a cozy little town called Puerto Morelos - especially Los Pelicanos restaurant, around dusk time. I have to say that initially we were dragged to one of the \"presentations\" and had a hard time saying No 'till the end. If you stand your ground politely but firmly, the vendors that approach you will generally get the message. Make sure you let them know from the start.

A little chilly on winter break. -Try to stay in BLDG 10 or closer, otherwise, you risk extremely long walks or shuttle wait times -All tile floors throughout, so noises at night can be loud I want to warn you to go to the timeshare presentation at your own risk. Immediately, after check in we were approached by one of the timeshare to staff to get a \"presentation.\" We asked if this was for the timeshare and said I wasn't that interested. I was told it was 90 minutes and there was no obligation they just wanted us to attend. They offered a 10% discount on food and beverage, an additional $100 off our bill, a discount to Xcaret. and we would be taken to breakfast with our sales person. We reluctantly agreed after being reassured of the time, what was involved, and that there was no pressure; \"This is your vacation after all.\" We met our sales rep for a brief sit down before breakfast. My wife began the conversation after exchanging niceties by asking about what they were offering hoping to get to the point. The rep said we would discuss this at breakfast. She then mentioned that she had no interest in wasting our time and if we weren't interested that was fine. She repeated several times she had a golf lesson and didn't want to take too much time. We then proceeded to breakfast with two six year old kids already starting to get fidgety after sitting and chatting for 20 minutes. The line was out the door and we had to wait an additional 30 minutes to just get in the door. My kids are crying and getting extremely frustrated by this point. At no point during our wait even after asking would the rep discuss what she was trying to sell. We sit down for breakfast and it is a buffet so we have to get up, get food, and get the kids situated. As I am trying to take care of everyone in my family she starts to discuss the timeshare with my wife and then filling me in on the bits and pieces. She could have presented to both of us in the previous 90 minutes we have been together. We finished breakfast and then she asked me to leave the tip. I have been in sales for over 20 years and never asked a potential client for anything. I was a bit shocked. This was after she said to my wife, \"You really like to eat!\" My wife is not a very big person, so I was floored by that comment. As we were walking to the sales office I informed her that I was not interested and didn't want to waste her time as outlined at the start of the day. This is where the closing started. She brought us into the sales office and started get extremely angry. Informing that I went up to the buffet more times than I did, which was quickly corrected. I didn't pay enough attention although she was to get to the point. She then got the first of three managers over to start closing me. I informed him that we were now going on almost 3 hours and I was interested. He looked at me disdainfully wondering if I had ever been on a timeshare presentation. As if I should have been expecting to be lied to about the time commitment. I have been on other presentations, but nothing as unprofessional as this. After getting very curt with him he left. This left us alone with our sales rep who then began closing my wife and told me she wasn't talking to me anymore, as if my wife and I would not make any decision like this together. After another 10 minutes of closing we proceeded to sit down with tow other managers/reps. I was very direct with them and they closed me one more time getting down to a bottom line quickly. At that point I told them free wasn't cheap enough. He then pleasantly got me out there. I did receive all my discounts promised and didn't have any problem with that part. It took about another 24 hours to shake off the horrible experience. I wasn't alone, however. Our experience was similar to everyone else at the pool who went on the presentation. I complained about the beds and never once did I get a good answer about getting it fixed. I did hear how rich the owner was, though, like I should care. I would avoid this unless you really want to save about $200-$300. I still can't decide if the savings I got was worth it. I had a decent time because I was with my family and on vacation.

They are both quite nice but the GM is a step up in room size and amenities, and the use of the exclusive pool sections make for a less-crowded pool experience. Service in the restaurants was very good for the most part, although we noticed with their implementation of tips automatically added to the bill it was not as earnest. Waiters were very cordial and competent. I'm sure the lodging prices are in line with other resorts of this quality in the area, but we felt the food and beverage prices were on the high side. We rented a car (whole other story) so were able to go into Playa for supplies, including many cans of beer which which at the WalMart in Playa cost about 1/5 of the price each at the resort. We also stocked up on fruit, coffee, soda and breads from the bakery. This, coupled with the nice kitchen in the room, allowed us to do breakfasts in our room. I imagine the trip to Walmart probably saved the four of us $300 vs. resort prices. We still spent plenty on food at the resort, just less. We all slept well as the beds were large and comfortable. The A/C was somewhat loud but it was nice white noise for us, as it masked most nighttime sounds in the hallway. Absolutely no complaints about cleanliness. We tipped our maid about 50 pesos each day which seemed to help make her responsiveness and effort superior. Probably would have been very good anyway. We were in Edificio 3 on the third floor which was a good location. I would suggest asking for a room facing the lake if possible if you are in buildings 1-7, as ours was facing the parking lot.

Pools- huge, extensive, well laid out. cool features like gradual steps, submerged seats and laying out areas,etc. Have never seen a bigger or better pool system than the combined pools at the Mayan Palace/Grand Mayan. A +++ 2. rooms- Really well appointed, great AC, bathroooms are immaculate and perfectly set up. huge jacuzzi tubs, nice king size beds, ample sitting areas. Overall really well done. 3. Gym- I like working out on vacation and the gym was great. good hours, well equipped with free weights, treadmills, spinnning, elliptical, yoga room, precor, SMith Machine,etc. 4. food- Balche, the poolside lunch place, was excellent. Tramonto was solid and the Sushi place was very good. Prices are higher than in Playa Del Carmen, but then again you don't have to hop in a cab and spend RT $40 to get there and back. 5. Overall design- it is big, we were in building 2 so did not have the inconvenience of having to take a shuttle. The architecture is really pretty, I can't imagine the place packed because it is so big 6. Customer service- solid, wait staff was excellent, checkout/concierge were really helful and expedient. Professionally done Cons 1. Beach- small, not really a swimming beach. Too rocky to walk out, and the waves were quite big. If you prefer swimming in the ocean and enjoying the water, this might not suit you. There is a beach about 10-15 minutes down that is better, but these are not like tranquil Carribbean beaches like St. Maarten or St. Thomas with acquarium clear blue water and white sand 2.

When you meet the sales person for your presentation tell them up front your purpose. Make sure they understand. Again be firm. 3. During the presentation remind them your purpose and they only have 90 minutes. Be polite but firm. 4. After 90 minutes or so get ready to leave. This will be the hard part.

We were there Thanksgiving week, it was busy but not packed. Most of other reviews were on point, here are a few extra pointers that may be helpful. ROOMS: The rooms are awesome, pictures were actually what the room looked like for once. When you check in make sure you confirm what building you are in, like everyone else I requested Bldg 1-4, when I was handed my room info and it started with a 3 I figured that meant bldg. 3. However we didn't figure out until we got on our shuttle that we were really in bldg. 13, our mistakes for not asking but just a FYI, don't assume your bldg. # by room #. Bldg. 13 is literally the farthest bldg. from the lobby, pools, etc., about a 15 min. walk but a nice walk, note to cut through the golf course and the Greenbreak restaurant for a short cut. Had very few problems with getting a shuttle, usually if we started walking someone would pick us up. There are 2 perks to this bldg. it is right next to the pick up spot for the shuttle into Playa Del Carmen, and only like 2 minutes from the main entrance, this came in handy for when we had to walk to the main gate for our pickup for our tours and to catch a collectivo. I would defiantly recommend the 2nd or 3rd floor, we had to 3rd and had a great view of the golf course and had very few problems with noise. If you do plan on cooking in the room, I'd recommend getting cooking spray or at least butter for the pans, it took a lot of scrubbing to get them clean. POOLS/BEACH: Pools were fantastic, had no problem finding chairs or a good sunny or shady spot. The main Grand Mayan Pool had pretty good service although the pool service was slow, I'd recommend going up to the bar if you want faster service. Off of the Grand Mayan, head left from the pool bar is another pool, it has a river type connect to the Mayan Pools, it's a infinity pool overlooking the river and was the best pool we thought, sadly we came across it our last day. The service was much better here, a lot less people, better music and the bar was dead. The beach is rocky but gorgeous, I recommend laying out at night at least once, we saw the most incredible shooting stars and it was super relaxing being the only ones out there. Hands down take advantage of the happy hour, 11-1 at the pool bars and 3-5 at Greenbreak. My pina colodas were 70 pesos, especially when you can get them double the size it's so worth it, and our all drinks were poured well. However don't waste your money with the special pineapple or coconut monkey drinks, yes they are super cute but are not that tasty and were expensive. RESTAURANTS: They were good but nothing to write home about. Drinks were always good, the food variety isn't so much and the prices are to be expected. Besides the Lobster dinner ($50 for salad, lobster tail, risotto and desert) at Tramonto (Friday Nights) that I highly recommend, the best thing I really think we had was a cheeseburger at Havanna Moon. The room service was excellent though, and the chocolate cake was devine. WALMART: We did go to Walmart to get snacks and boos, I defiantly recommend this it saved money and we had breakfast every day in the room, and it was convieint to have snacks for at night since it's a jaunt to anywhere with food. Be prepared though, the only thing in english is the alcohol pretty much, we had difficulty deciphering what product we were actually buying. Plus the place is chaotic! It's about 2-3 blocks from the shuttle drop off. TRANSPORTATION: If you plan to rent a car, make sure your are familar with the road signs and know where the hell you are going. I was constantly confused just by riding with the locals. Plus they are crazy drivers and be aware of the speed bumps (topas) in the middle of highway. We used the resort shuttle into Playa a few times, was pretty easy and effiecnet, was $5 or 50 pesos. The shuttle serive from the airpot was easy, ignore the people inside the airport and make sure you walk all the way outside. We had trouble finding our person from the resort and the guys outside on the landing wearing yellow, I'd assume they were airport employees, were very kind in helping me find our right person. We took a taxi back to the airport and it was $30 for us, $15 per person. If you need to travel any fartehr than Playa I'd try out a collectivo, we went to Xel-Ha and didn't do a tour, therefore did not get transportation. All you do is cross the highway and wait till you see the Collectivo (white van with either a orange, red or aqua stripe) or a van-shuttle looking thing that says Playa Express on it. They usually see you esaily and will stop if they have room. From the resort you have to take one into Playa and then transfer to one that goes towards Tulumn, this was really easy. From the resort to Playa it was 20 pesos, from Playa to Xel-Ha it was 30 peso, way cheaper then the 680 peso taxi. Just make sure you are looking out for your stop and yell out in advance for the driver to stop at your location. MONEY: For the resort being cash free, it was way more convient than I thought. Exchange money in Playa, they seemed to have the best exchange rates. I'd recommend to make sure you have pesos for the taxi's, etc. they defienalty do not abide by the current exhange rate. Had to problem paying with cards or US $ in town wiht the ppropaite exchange rate. TIMESHARE: We didn't do the presnentation but did get hassled about it wiht phone messages. But if you do think you'll have 3 hours to sit through it I'd wait a couple days, just because the bribes to attend the meeting got better throughout the week.

The fact that I also spoke in Spanish made it easier for them to not try to continue convincing me. Great service, awesome pools, but, the problem with this resort is that it's way too big. We were in building 8 and the only way to get to the main area of the resort was to take a shuttle which came to pick you up once every 20 minutes, otherwise, it was a 15 minute walk to the lobby. The most disappointing part of this resort is the fact that it doesn't have a beach, the beach it does have is rocky and you can't really get in the water cause you'll literally hurt yourself. The other thing that was just bad was the wireless internet. $75 a week and it's the speed of dialup. We were trying to access Youtube and also upload photos to Facebook and even though the signal was at full bar, the speed was just sooooo slow. When I mentioned this to staff upon checkout over the phone, they were rude to me and asked me why I had not brought this issue to them before, which I thought was a fair response, but, being in IT myself and knowing that I had full bars, I knew it wasn't anything they could fix, so I just wanted to bring it to their attention. We basically just used this place to sleep. Also....there were little centipedes walking around in the bathrooms every day when we got home....but, it's Cancun, so, expect bugs in your rooms, it's normal I guess. Hotel staff were overall extremely courteous and friendly. Not sure I would stay here again though, probably because resort is just way too big.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Germany", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel to rest\u201d", "Author": "FD09", "ReviewID": "UR121369907", "Content": "You can spend your holidays in the hotel.

It was a fantastic experience. Rooms Ours was a 2 bedroom unit that was the largest timeshare unit we have ever had. The room was what the resort calls a Grand Villa indicating that the lock out unit contained a completely separate living area which contained a smaller fridge and microwave. Each bedroom contained a king bed. The bedding and mattress were top rate. We hosted guests and so the room attendant would make up trundle beds each night. In the main living area this amounted to 3 beds and in the lock out living area 2 more. The kitchen was modern in style and contained a large fridge, a microwave and a cook top. No oven. We found the kitchen area more than adequate. Note: there is an espresso machine in the room (but the espresso packets are charged at about $2 per, there was no indication of this charge near the machine). The unit does contain a drip coffeemaker with a built in filter basket. There is a blender, corkscrew, and dishes and utensils. No tupperware so if you have left overs you should bring ziplock bags, etc. Our unit was on the first floor and the ice maker was on the second floor but it was convenient enough. Wifi was available at no charge and while it was not super fast it was consistent and adequate. There are flat panel TVs in both bedrooms and both living areas. Limited English language channels but CNN, FOX News and ESPN are all there. The patio area was very large and contained a table with four chairs, a sofa, 2 lounge chairs and a splash pool. The splash pool is larger than the one at Grand Mayan but it was so cold the kids didn\u2019t even use it. I suspect in the heat of the summer it would be popular. The lock out had 2 smaller patio areas. One contained 2 chairs and a small table. The other had two lounge chairs. Resort So many of the other reviews do a great job of laying out the resort. Here are a few additions. First, the Grand Luxxe pool is larger than it appears but it is not as elaborate as the Grand Mayan or Mayan Palace Pools. It has more of a lounge feel to it and there are no scheduled activities. Having said that, the beach is steps away from this pool and you can easily traverse between the two during the day. During our stay there were people at the pool each day but there was no problem finding chairs and no problems grabbing a palapa at the beach either. The pool also has the Burger Custom Made poolside restaurant. We ate there a couple of times and the burgers were remarkably good. We discovered you can custom design the nachos there too. We changed ours from steak to chicken and from yellow cheese to white cheese. No problems. Finally, there is a 2x1 Happy Hour at this pool (like the others) from 11 am to 1 pm. All of the pools are spectacular in my opinion. I must mention the Grand Mayan Sanctuary Pool. While not located at the beach it is very remarkable. Pictures can\u2019t do it justice. The landscaping and the large palapa like structure that rings it are something to appreciate. Restaurants We ate at Havana Moon, Green Break, Gong and Tramonto. Every meal was good. Prices were on the expensive side for Mexico but not out of line for what we would see on a night out in Kansas City. Havana Moon and Green Break were the more affordable. Green Break had a really good breakfast and lunch. There is a Happy Hour at Green Break from 3 - 5. Please let us know if you have questions about the restaurants. We used room service twice and food was good with prompt delivery. Service In our opinion this is where the resort really stood out. Almost to a person we had excellent service. From the poolside concierge who would bring Popsicles and cold towels around each day to our room attendant who would make towel designs, there were always smiles and can do attitudes. Activities Both the Grand Mayan and Mayan Palace pools had daily scheduled activities. We played bocce ball and darts one day and our kids played chess one time. Plenty to do for every member of the family. If you win one of the games you win a free drink at the poolside bar. There is a kids club at the Mayan Palace pool with daily activities, too. Our kids did not use the kids club but we saw kids there every day. Access to the gym was no additional charge for those staying at the Grand Luxxe. The gym has Precor equipment and is well set up. The spa is nice and includes both a dry and wet sauna as well as a hot and cold jacuzzi. We booked an excursion to Xel-Ha through the tour desk at the hotel. I would highly recommend Xel-Ha. We have 2 boys ages 11 and 8 and they both loved it. One of the best excursions for the money we have ever done. A couple of things worth mentioning: Bring $1 bills for tips as they work really well. A 15% tip is automatically included in all food/beverage purchases made poolside or in a restaurant. So singles work for other service workers on resort or if your waiter was exceptional. If staying at the Grand Luxxe there is a dedicated shuttle service and nearly any worker will call to arrange a pick up from any location on resort. Email the concierge in advance of your arrival to arrange a free shuttle for you and your family from the airport to the resort. We used a standard taxi for the four of us to return to the airport and it was 325 pesos.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Woodlands, Texas", "Title": "\u201cGrand Mayan\u201d", "Author": "Ewr01", "ReviewID": "UR121165667", "Content": "Stayed here from the 19th to the 26th of Nov. The resort is nice and huge. I am a Grand Mayan owner so I always try to stay at one of the properties when visiting Mexico. Very important - as you walk through Cancun airport, ignore everyone trying to talk to you like the plague. Just go straight outside, where the Grand Mayan transportation is waiting. (You can arrange this directly with the Grand Mayan concierge prior to arrival.) This is my first time at the Riviera Maya resort. We were in Building 4, which is probably a 5-8 minute walk to the pools, and at least 10 minutes to the beach. As other travelers say, try to reserve a spot in buildings 1 to 8. The others are just too far of a walk. The pools are magnificent. I suggest you reserve a palapa early in the morning (you can do so at the Balche restaurant) so your family can have a nice place to hang out. I think the deposit is around 350 MXN, which they waive if you spend that much in food and drinks. The beach is also beautiful. However, be warned - it is rocky. It's probably best that you wear water shoes while swimming. In any case, I've always found the Caribbean waters to be better for swimming (it's warmer) that the Pacific. Restaurants are okay, albeit a little expensive. We went to Playa del Carmen a couple of times for dinner. Try to find a restaurant that is a little bit outside of 5th avenue (the tourist area). We ate at La Mission (there should be reviews here in Tripadvisor), and I think the food there was great for the price. We were a huge party (11), but we were able to get a taxi (van) that will take us to Playa and pick us up when we're done. We arranged transportation thru the Concierge. We took a couple of tours (to Chichen Itza and Xel-ha/Tulum), offered thru the Grand Mayan travel desk. It was really cheap (even cheaper than internet prices), if you attend the sales presentation. This is the important part - be prepared for some high-pressure sales tactics. And remember, if you sign away your life savings, you have five days to rescind your contract. That should take care of buyer's remorse. If you do go ahead with any purchase, make sure that you have done so knowing that this is best for your family. Like I said, I am a Grand Mayan owner. I do not regret being one. It doesn't work the same for everyone, however. So be warned. All in all, a very nice resort. It's a little far from Cancun (about 30 miles, and a 450 MXN taxi ride one way), and closer to Playa del Carmen (they have a shuttle service for 5 USD per person I believe). If it's your first time in Cancun, you may want to stay somewhere at the Hotel Zone. I have my 2 kids with me, and all they want to do is hang out by the pools and the beach, so the Grand Mayan's location works for us.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Canaan, Connecticut, United States", "Title": "\u201cGreat Vacation\u201d", "Author": "Paul R", "ReviewID": "UR120817013", "Content": "Just got back yesterday 12 -19th Nov holiday.

We own a timeshare at another resort and booked through HSI for a small fee. I emailed the concierge before we left home and booked the free shuttle to the resort and requested a room closer to the beach and pools. As directed by the concierge, we walked right past the timeshare people in the lobby and found the Mayan Resort transportation reps. After a short wait and a fairly short drive, we arrived at the resort. We were assigned Room 1440, which was in building 3. Unfortunately it was around noon and check-in was not until 5. After check-in, we were approached by a timeshare rep. We were offered breakfast, 2 free massages and 10% off our bill if we attended a presentation.We declined and didn't feel pressured. (We received one phone call later in the week to check if we were interested, but weren't bothered.) We were given a coupon for 25% off for lunch at Blue Fin(?) and enjoyed some great fish tacos and calamari poorboy. Since it was Happy Hour (11 to 1 half price drinks), we enjoyed a few drinks and set off to explore this gigantic resort. We found beautifully landscaped grounds, many pools and little niches where you can find some privacy. We debated on going to Walmart to pick up some groceries, but decided that we'd just pick up a few items at the store on the resort grounds. With just the two of us, we were afraid we'd over-buy at Walmart and end up wasting food at the end of the week. We bought some bread, cold cuts, cheese, milk, fruit, and beer. I brought some rum & wine, cereal, and a few snacks from home. At 5 we were taken to our 1BR suite. It was impressive with a small kitchen, large living room and bedroom, and beautiful bathroom. Our room was on the ground floor and had a garden view. We had no problem with bugs with the exception of a few spiders. Everything was kept scrupulously clean during our stay. If you plan to cook, keep in mind that the cookware is pretty limited. The suite would easily accommodate 6 people, and there are plenty of dishes and glassware, but the cookware was pretty limited. If you wanted to make pasta for a large group, the pans wouldn't be big enough and there was no colander. No problem for us, as I didn't turn on the stove once while we were there. No cooking on vacation for me! The bed was a little hard, but I didn't mind it. The bathroom has two sinks, a shower, and plenty of towels and nice toiletries. Outside the bath is another sink and vanity. Inside the bedroom is a large jacuzzi tub, which we didn't use. On the patio, there's a personal infinity pool, but the water was too cold. The suite was quite luxurious and nicely decorated. This vacation was for total relaxation and we didn't leave the resort. Our routine was light breakfast in our room then head to the beach. I packed some sandwiches and a few beers and some sangria which I put in my bubba keg. The insulated bag and ice pack that I brought from home came in handy. Some days we had nachos on the beach. Beach service was great, with Guadalupe our favorite waitress. She was fantastic and very fast delivering drinks during happy hour. We ordered drinks everyday and found them to be delicious, strong, and decently priced. The liquor is premium. Great Bloody Mary's, Pina Coladas, Mud Slides, etc. The beach was pleasant and there were always palapas available. No need to play the towel game, but this was off-season. As others have mentioned, the beach is very rocky, though a few people went over the rocks into the deeper water. We walked the beach and enjoyed looking for shells and critters in the tidal pools. The large swimming pool is nearby if you want to take a dip. The weather is in the low 80's and perfect most of the time. Every evening we went out to one of the restaurants and enjoyed a great meal. We weren't disappointed at any of the restaurants and found the prices to be reasonable. The food quality and service were outstanding. We ate at Gong, Tramonto, Havana Moon, and Frida's. We didn't try the buffet. You do need reservations for Gong & Tramonto, but we were able to get in at the last minute. We usually had drinks, appetizer, main course and sometimes dessert. Our bill for food and drinks at the end of the stay was less than $700. Service was excellent. Someone was always cleaning, pruning, mowing, etc. The wait staff was excellent as well. The evening it was at Frida's it started to rain. The waiter found an umbrella for a woman who was leaving in the heaviest rain. Another woman was cold, so she was given a blanket. Staff greeted guests with Hola as they were passing by. I felt totally safe while at the Grand Mayan. The Grand Mayan is a great place for families, or couples who want a quiet, romantic holiday. If you want nightlife, this place is probably not for you.

As someone wrote before, I arrived for an 8 day stay and was placed in Building 13 in the one bedroom suite. The suites are awesome and like living in an upscale condo. After 3 days of walking and spending all my time waiting on a shuttle, I dicsussed my options with the front desk. After two days of discussions, they moved me to a suite in Building 6. This made a huge difference and I was close to everything. So, I would recommend not staying in buildings 8 - 13 of you can keep from it. When making reservations, ask what buidling you are assigned. The hotel workers are very friendly and speak to you as you pass them walking around the resort. Some Helpful Tips: When you arrive at the airport, just walk through to the outside and find the resort shuttle. Do not stop for anyone. DO NOT attend the presentations no matter what they promise you. I was told I would be attending a 90 minute presentation, free breakfast and an offshore fishing trip. I told them upfront that I had no plans to purchase a time share as I also told the salesperson when I arrived at the slotted time we planned. After \"4 HOURS\" I told them I wasnt interested for the 5th time and 3rd representative but this didnt stop them from pressuring. I was them taken to another area and was told I had a one time opportunity to buy a \"pre-foreclosure\" from someone at one forth the price. I again told them I wasnt interested and I was called a \"User\" by the final sales person. I got up and walked away with my fishing trip. Come to find out they booked me on the fishing trip out of Cancun (37.00 cab ride each way) and not the one from the resort. They finally gave me a 100.00 credit and I booked the trip locally. It was not worth the day I lost. Don't attend the presentations no matter what they promise you. I've been on several of these and this one had to be the worse one ever ! Other than the sales presentation, I would say go to this place if you want the resort surroundings and freindly people. There are many pools to pick from and all are great. One other comment... Im not sure why these resorts in Mexico think Americans like listening to Barry Manilow all day or the 80's elevator music. They really need to up theor game on music choices.

We own at the Mayan Palace, the adjoining property, and since we went during low season we were able to upgrade to the Mayan Palace. The intent of the vacation was mostly to relax by the pool and do some light sight seeing. Airport: Have the hotel arrange transportation for you. It will be 50% less than taking a public taxi. Also don't talk to any of the \"helpful\" people in the airport lobby, they are just trying to get you to go to a timeshare presentation at one resort or the other. Takes about 20 minutes from the airport to get to hotel. Once you check in the bell boy will take you and your luggage, by cart, to your building and get you settled into your room. The grounds are huge, but shuttles run every 15 minutes and it is real easy to get from your building to the main lobby. The walk from building 8 to the pool was about 15 minutes, but it was through a winding jungle path were we would see pheasants, butterflys, coati's, all sorts of song birds, iguanas and we could stop by the crocodile pond or see the flemencos. There are three main pool areas. There is the main Mayan Palace pool which is huge and has kiddie pool area close to the beach. There is the Grand Mayan pool right off the main lobby that is very peaceful and tropical. There is the Grand Mayan beach pool, which has a sand beach and an infinity ledge overlooking one of the lagoons. We used all three but our favorite was the Grand Mayan beach pool. The kids loved the sand and we loved the fact that it had a dedicated bar. The beach is more of a tide pool beach and not really suited for typical ocean swimming. We still spent many hours playing in the sand and chasing fish in the tide pools. I guess you can walk down the beach 15-20 minutes either way and get to a decent sandy beaches, but we didn't try. We ate at all the resturants and never had a bad experience. The food is very good and the service is excellence. Many of them have shows on certain nights and they were very entertaining.

We have gone to both Xcaret and Xel Ha (natural preserve water themed parks) If you have kids you'll need to spend a full day at each. We prefer Xel Ha, less touristic and all inclusive for food and drink. Timeshare: We own one and it has saved us money on our vacations, but it will still be years before we break even and really start saving money. We like that is forces us to take a vacation and overall we are happy with the decision. That being said: If you want to buy a timeshare my advice would be to buy one from someone who is interested in selling and not directly from the resorts. You'll save lots. Timeshare Presentations: 90 mins if you say no, no, no and then finally no. If you actually negotiate and are not firm with your \"no's\" it can take hours. Here is what to expect: First you'll sign in and they assign someone to you. That person will take you to breakfast/lunch at the Lago buffet, get to know you, make small talk and answer general questions. Then they will take you for a tour of the grounds and the units. Then they will bring you back to the sales center. At this point they will start to explain the high level program. When it gets to pricing they usually bring in the manager who is an expert and explaing the cost of the programs and while not a hard sales approach they are persistent in showing you the value and how much you can save over time. If you are interest you should still say it's too much money at least 4-5 times and they will give you all sorts of lower cost options. When you finally say NO THANK YOU, they will say fine and ask you to give a review of the experience to someone. This is not a review really, just a new person trying to see if they can get you to buy. Just keep saying no and that you are ready to go and eventually it's over. We got a 10% discount off our total bill and 1,500 peso room credit for attending. For us it took about 2 hours and i thought all the sales people did a good job and were nice. Final advice on timeshare presentations: Don't go unless you are really interested and prepared to spend the money to own. Think $9K to $60K, of course they will finance. :) If you do go, make sure you get something good in return and make up your mind (everyone who will attend) to say no, no matter what the deal is. Oh...and if you do happen to not be able to say no. You have 3 days by Mexican law, to cancel. They completely understand this and the sales person may actually set up a time to buy you a drink later in the week just to make it \"personable\" so you don't cancel. Overall: We love the Grand Mayan, the kids loved the Grand Mayan, we will go back there many times over the years.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonton, Canada", "Title": "\u201cGreat Stay at the Grand Mayan!\u201d", "Author": "Hezzybaby", "ReviewID": "UR119837881", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Mayan from October 15-22. we received the room free through a friend who owns a timeshare at the resort and was offered a 2 for 1 room special. We took them up on the offer. We were a group of 8, 4 adults and 4 kids ages, 18, 12, 6 and 2. The shuttle from the airport was easy and there was no issues. Be aware, we e-mailed the shuttle company asking if they would provide a carseat for our 2 year old and they said they would do their best to accomidate, when we arrived there was no car seat...Oh well, I strapped baby in the van the best i could. Likewise at the Almo car rental at the Mayan Palace where I pre ordered a car on points, I was told I could request a carseat. When i arrived, they car agent looked at me like I was nuts asking for the car seat I requested stating \"we dont use those in Mexico.\" So we went the week with me sitting in the back seat with the baby in a seatbelt and me holding on to her. Not ideal,but we made due. If you are one that is quite ridgid with your baby in a car seat, bring your own, dont rely on car rental companies or shuttle companies to provide. On that note we arrived to the Grand Mayan and were greeted right away, the check in process was a bit of a gong show, kids were excited, running all over the place, while we tried to get our credit card assigned to the room, all the adults have to sign to have signing authority at the resort, etc...all in all it took about 20 minutes. We were greeted by a lady who gave us a map of the property (which comes in handy!!!) she did not pressure us to go to meetings/timeshares etc. In fact we did not get asked once. We were in a two bedroom suite, and let me tell you, it was beautiful and spacious, 8 people could easily call it home for a week or two. Our kids loved the splash pool on the balcony and the jetted tub in the ensuite. Kitchenette was basic, but served us well. The grounds are beautiful, the walking paths are extensive. If you hate walking dont book here, its not ocean front, the beach is about a 10 minute walk through the Grand Mayan grounds and to the Mayan Palace. The pools at the Mayan Palace have more activites and a great poolside restauraunt. Even though we bought groceries and booze in Playa we ended up eating lunches and ordering yummy drinks by the pool every day....The food selection was great, and lunches are huge! Take advantage of the Happy Hour!! We went to the Mexican Fiesta which is offered at Del Lago on Thursday nights. For 55 USD you have all you can eat and drink plus a mariachi band, lots of colorful costumes. the food was great, service amazing, the kids loved the show. We thought it a great way to give the kids a taste of \"Mexican Culture\" with out having to actually leave the resort! LOL The kids especially loved \"Poncho\", the donkey that you could take pics with outside Del Lago! Our last night we ate at the Italian place called Tramondo. We had the lobster special which was great! We aways had drinks at our meals and ordered wine. So much has been said about the beach, its rocky, for sure, My kids loved combing through the tide pools created by the rocks to find crabs, fish, starfish, etc...We found it to be a great learning opprtunity for our kids to experience the creatures of the sea. I did not mind it at all. The older boys who wanted to boogie board and body surf were dissapointed, we did a trip into Playa one day and they did all the wave surfing, boogie boarding they could handle! Long story short, you wont be dissapointed. Is it pricey? yeah if your used to All In's you can get a bit of sticker shock when you get the bill at the end of the week. If you have a tight rope tied around your wallet, this might not be the place for you. Like I said we were a family of 8 with 4 adults, 2 teenagers (one of which was of drinking age and could tilt back a few miami vice's at the pool) and two small children. We tried to eat and drink at the room as much as we could but just found the food and booze the hotel had to offer much more enticing. Our bill was 20,000 pesos. Approx 1600 CDN dollars I think? YIKES but sooo worth it. We made great memories with our family to last a lifetime! Plus we got our beautiful room for free, so who is complaining? LOL We never had an issue with being charged for things that we didnt order, never had an issue with cleanliness of the room. The musty smell, was there, but its more of a \"jungle\" smell, what do you expect when its 90% humidity in the jungle? Tip: Rent snorkel gear at Akumal bay! The sea turtles and fish are amazing my 6 year old was in absolute AWE! What a great day! Tip 2: rent a car! Its reasonable and your about a 20 dollar cab ride from anywhere, including playa. Oh yeah, the BIGGEST complaint I have is the beds....OMG they are hard. felt like I was sleeping on a peice of plywood. I ended up moving my 6 year old a few nights off the couch and sleeping there.

We arrived early and knew that check in time was later than our arrival, we checked in and were given a coupon for 30% off for lunch. After lunch we went back and our rooms were ready. The pools are fantastic! The poolside service workers always have a smile and offer friendly advise, you do not want long for service. You can go dancing everynight. We did a romantic dinner on the pier. PRICELESS!!! Taxi service is inexpensive. $22 to get to Playa. You should wear water shoes to enter the water at the beach. But from my experience most of the Riveria Mayan beaches are rocky. The meals are not that expensive, the prices are comparable to City prices actually a little lower. We were not hassled aabout any time shares. When asked after check in if we wanted to go to a presentation we said NO and that was the end of it. We have always had a positive experience the only negative I have to report is that our Vacation was too short. If you are looking for a young crowd early 20's to 30 then this is not the resort for you. If you are looking to relax, dance, spend time with friends, be romantic then this is the resort for you. If you are concerned about the expensive of meals the Club Sandwich is large enough for two people. Most of the lunches can be split between two people. You have many food choices and all of our meals were fantastic. The two bedroom is very spacious with a full size refrig, stove, and microwave.

They sell it as it is a 5 stars members only club, but for me it's not. Let's begin by mentioning the horrible customer service experience at the front desk at the time of checking and thru out the week. My reservation said standard room with kitchen facilities and when I requested the room with the kitchen facilities they told me that it was an error in my reservation that I only pay for a \"standard room\", Come on people why can't you honor what's on your reservation ticket? Anyway if it wasn't for the friendly representative at the SFX we wouldn't have gotten our one bedroom apartment... Thank you SFX. The room (standar room): the room was really nice and very spacious, but the only cons for the room was the bed. The bed was really hard and not conftarble at all... The only nice thing was that every night we had our beds open by the maids. The room also had very spacious bathroom with a full size Jacuzzi. (this was nice).. The apartment: they finally upgraded us to a one bedroom full size kitchen apartment and I have to say that the unit was amazing. Again with the only exception of the rock hard unconftarble beds. The bathroom had a full size hot tub, but not a jacuzzi and this is because the room has it's own little \u00a0pool in the balcony. (small but nice).. Common areas: the pools were amazing. Almost the entire resort was surrounded by beautiful pools all around. They had some great activities, but some how very cheezze. They only had two pool bars and one very far away from the other.\u00a0 Beach access: there is none...well, the property offers beach access, but in reality is like not having a beach on promises. The are full of rocks and nobod is able t get in the water.. ****WARNING**** Don't \u00a0be fooled by the friendly staff right after your check in. They are going to approach like they are trying to give you information and a map about how to get around in the resort, but at the end all they are looking to do is to get your name and a $10- dollars deposit for a \"90 minutes sales presentation\". (timeshare). Its not worth your time to see their presentation what an awful experience. Those 90 minutes turned to be 7 hours and sat down with 9 different people each one of the trying to sell you a timeshare. \u00a0Horrible horrible experience. Never again. If you decide to do it, you can negotiate a nice spa treatment or some tickets for a park or something. We got \"hooked\" to the presentation because a free bottle of tequila. Then after talking to people we were informed tha pretty much you can negotiate any exucursion, resort credit, spa treatment in exchange of your time. Make sure you negotiate this with the first person you talk to.

Had a 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite shared with another couple. Have noticed that the reviews have been very mixed. I think this depends entirely upon your purpose and expectations. We went to relax and had been there once before (to the adjacent Mayan Palace). We found the 10-minute walk from our Bldg # 6 to the pool area to be a lovely, pleasant walk through tropical gardens - and liked being away from the main section. It does seem that Buildings 1-7 in Grand Mayan are the \"closest\"; the higher numbered buildings are more along the golf course. This was one of the most relaxing vacations we've ever had. Because we'd done some of the sights previously (Tulum, Puerto Murales, Playa del Carmen) before, this time we mostly sat by one of the many pools and read. We did go snorkeling at Akumal Beach, which was lovely and good snorkeling - calm water, walk in, and reef close in. We had excellent meals at both Tremonto and Gong, as well as lunches at Bluefish (served by the pool) and Balche. Service was consistently good. Our room was maintained impeccably by Marcela and Maria. All the public areas were clean and well maintained. If you go there, be prepared to be approached, as mentioned many times before, by the timeshare folks. They offer a sizeable discount off your tab if you listen to their spiel for 90 minutes over a good buffet breakfast. If you don't want to hear any more, either don't go or simply get up and leave. All in all, we would recommend the place to others and go again ourselves. Note though that the Grand Mayan is the upscale version and has it's own pool areas, in addition to access to the major Mayan Palace pools. The one bedroom suite also has a wading pool. The one bedroom has a whirlpool in the room.

Rainy season? We didn't see it. I will start off by saying that the only way you could think this hotel is anything less than fabulous is if you're a spoiled brat! Sorry, real talk. Of course there are downsides to any place (which I will get to later) but the resort is absolutely beautiful and wonderful! Just be a smart traveler and plan ahead! Be sure to email the concierge before your arrival and make special requests (buildings 1-4) and RENT A CAR!!! The hotel is beyond expensive (duh) but rent a car and beat the system! We rented from National and the entire week rental was less than 200 dollars and we spent less than 100 on gas during the week and we went adventuring every day, even as far as Coba! The savings on food alone is worth it, not to mention the added freedom to explore and really experience the region. And if you have 2 people and plan on making even one excursion off the grounds, you will already be looking at close to 200. ITS WORTH IT! Driving wasn't too scary, once you get the hang of it. Parking was never too bad (don't park at yellow curbs). And make sure you ask for \"magna\" at the gas station. I am pregnant so I didn't want to be stuck walking really far in the heat, so we stayed in building 1. We were on the ground floor, but didn't notice much mildew smell and no noises from above. If you have a car, building 2 is probably best as it is a little closer to the parking lot and still easy distance from the main grounds. Parking was never a problem. Now for the good points about the hotel: The grounds are incredible! So beautiful and well maintained. And we never felt crowded by other guests. Our room was very clean and amazingly well appointed. Everything we needed. Maid service is good, room was relaxing and we loved it. It was nice to have a kitchen, another budget helper. The pools are unlike anything you have ever seen. The Grand Mayan pools are the nicest, but we thought the people were friendlier at the big Mayan Palace pools (both guests and employees) so we only hung out at the GM pools late at night when they were deserted and so beautiful and romantic. Pool Bar II in the MP pools was great. Nice people, but away from the busy area by the Balche snack bar. We only ate at Balche and Havana Moon. Balche was ok, not great, not authentic, too much money. Havana Moon was expensive (to us!) but the atmosphere was awesome, the food was delicious and the entertainment starting at 8 was fun and different. We loved it. And we never got sick the whole time we were there, even eating a little local places. Just be careful, wash your hands and drink bottled water. The landscaping and pools are the highlight of the resort. The beach area is also beautiful. We liked the beds on the beach and the cool pier. But... On to the bad parts of the hotel: The beach is beautiful but it is not easy swimming. I am used to rocky water so I walked out and swam, but it was a little treacherous and I see why others aren't comfortable. Bring water shoes! And looked like the snorkeling could be fun right off the beach (try the north side of the pier). But again, rent a car and less than stellar beach is no big deal. Or walk south around the point to Playa Paraiso which is empty and beautiful, lots of places to swim and snorkel. My main problem with the hotel was pushy staff. I prefer to be left alone and this is not that kind of place. Maid service twice a day. Daily calls \"checking in\" on how we were doing. Maintenance people letting themselves in to \"make repairs\" unannounced. Obsessive security checks (you have to give your room number when you leave the grounds, when you return to the grounds and when you enter the parking lot, even though we left every day and the guards recognized us and our car... talk about overkill). On the upside we were not pressured at all about the timeshare, probably because we are young and they assumed, correctly, that we couldn't afford it anyway. It was also annoying to pay for internet, but what can you expect from these huge resorts? They want to make as much money as they can off you once you're there. Again, beat the system by renting a car! I think most the complaints about this resort are easily remedied by having a car and being able to leave. One last note: do check the charges well when you check out. They try to confuse you with weird labels that are not the names of the restaurants and the initial list is not itemized. Also, we never drank the bottled water out of our room but they tried to charge us for it anyway! Sneaky, sneaky. Other tips: We drove in to Playa almost every day for dinner, and to pick up supplies from Wal-Mart. Check out the Mega, it is clean and HUGE, but Wal-Mart has the cheapest prices (think 10 liters of water for 18 pesos, less than what the resort will charge you for 1.5 liters!). If you're on a budget, stay away from the restaurants on 5th Ave. WAY overpriced and most are not authentic Mexican food. We loved \"al Fogon\" which is a chain with a couple locations... open air tacqueria with yellow awnings, there is one across the street from Wal-Mart. Get the \"especial\" (recommended by our waitress when I tried to get tacos, and man she knew what she was talking about) and definitely try the frijoles. Best beans I've ever eaten. And if you're ready for a break from Mexican food, you have to try Babe's Noodles and Bar (Calle 10 btwn 5th and 10th Aves). Absolutely delicious and reasonably priced, especially if you're not starving and get the half portion. (Try the Swedish Meatballs. Sounds crazy but they are incredible and the place is owned by a Swedish woman so she knows what she is doing) Having a car is worth it so you can check out the beautiful beaches and attractions. Buy a guidebook to help you find your way. We went to the caves at Aktun-Chen (incredible), snorkeling at Yal-Ku lagoon in Akumal and with the boat co-op in Puerto Morelos (PM reef snorkeling should not be missed. EPIC! Just find the dock and sign up with the co-op) and hung out on the beach and cenote at Xcacel, a turtle nesting sanctuary (beautiful, deserted, cheap to get in to, creepy but fun cenote). We also went to the ruins at Coba (prego even climbed the pyramid!) and Tulum. Both were fun, but HOT! Rent bikes at Coba and bring your swimsuit for Tulum, best beach in the area by far. So much more fun than staying at the hotel the whole time. We had a great time, and you will too! Just plan ahead and rent a car. If you don't want to rent a car my advice is go to an all-inclusive. One last note: I bought our week long stay on Living Social (great deal!!!) and I am so happy I did. The deal went through smoothly, no trouble with booking, checking in or checking out. The deal included a 200 dollar resort credit, which was fabulous. You have to keep reminding them of the credit, at check in and ESPECIALLY at check out. They won't automatically add it, you have to ask for it again and again. But after the credit, we only spent 34 dollars at the hotel! Winning!!! Overall, we got a beautiful and luxury vacation at a totally budget price. Could not be happier. The resort, and the trip, is all what you make it!

Ive never stayed in such a stunning hotel before. We used this hotel through RCI which is owned by my partners father and we have used this before on a couple of occasions. When we arrived at Cancun Airport we had arranged for the shuttle bus to collect us and take us to the hotel There was a bit of a delay but we were on our way within 15 minutes. When we arrived at reception (which was stunning!), it was a very easy check in. Beware at that point you will be targeted by the sales reps!!! They are very smart and come up to you acting like they are a guide for the hotel providing you with maps etc! Although we know what the presentations are like and have also read all the comments on trip advisor we went anyway because they offered us 10% off our whole bill at the hotel and also offered us money off excursions. The presentation involved a free breakfast buffet at Lago restaurant and a tour of the rooms in the other hotels which was quite interesting. They then took you into the lounge where they sat for 30 minutes selling the product to you, after telling him over 10 times that we had no money and did not want the commitment at 27 he went on and on. Also beware that he will not be the only one who will do this to you! From the table to finally getting out the door back to our room, we had 4 others do the same 10 minute speech! They couldnt understand that at 27 you didnt want a debt of that much money!! As that was on our second day we put it down to a entertaining morning and got on with our holiday. The pools and grounds were amazing, very clean and tidy. The pools went on for miles and we felt like we had the pools to ourselves they were so big. We liked the infinity pool that was for Grand Mayan residents only and took advantage of the happy hour from 11-1pm. The rooms were very nice and spacious. Only negitive is that we were on the ground floor of building one and the room smelled of mildew. After a day or so (and some nice smelling things from wallmart) we had soon forgot about the smell (although our clothes were stinking when we got home because of it). The maid was in every morning and every night turning down your bed which was a nice touch. We were slightly alarmed by the number of times we found maintenance men in our room doing things like changing locks, changing curtains etc. We felt like this could be done when the room was free of guests. The restaurants were very lovely and Tramado and Gong were expensive but amazing. We went to Gong twice we loved it so much (go for the miso black cod!). The hotel supermarket was ok priced but quite a limited choice. We took the shuttle to Playa Del Carmin and bought groceries at Walmart and Mega. Also have a day at Playa beach if you can, was amazing and the sea was as warm as a bath!

We stayed at the Grand Mayan in Cancun. We've owned this time-share for 10 years and it seems every year we use it customer service is downgraded. Grand Mayan, Mayan Palace, Grand Luxx and all of their brand/names are in the same situation since they all are in the same complex. Here's my side of the story for this past vacation. We travel as a family so all 8 of us and my 4 year old (9 persons total) stay at the Grand Master Suite which contains two bedrooms and the kitchen, dining and living room. When we purchased this time-share, all the Grand Master Suites had one room with a king and the other room with two queens (3 beds in total). We get there and receive no reception, we have purchased \"Gold Crown\" which includes a special attention when you arrive, this didn't happen. No one care when we explained this. Then, we found out that internet is not free and not only that, is not free and roof expensive, we didn't understand this since owning a timeshare with this resort is expensive and internet is not free??? It is free in many places in Cancun, coffee shops, ferry, most of small shops, you find free internet almost everywhere you go. They finally gave us the keys, we get to our room/door and the keys don't work. The guy helping us with our luggage goes back to bring new keys, after 10 mins of being in the aisle waiting, security comes to ask us to be quiet in a very rude way. We explained that it was not our choice to be left out there, the keys just didn't work and with a very bad manner called a maintenance lady so she could open the door for us. We came in the room to find out that we don't have three beds but two. We called the concierge without answer then front desk then somewhere else, it took 30 mins to get a hold of someone, after we explained everything they said sorry we just cannot help you on regards to the beds right now but they said that they would solve everything on the next morning. The next morning came and lie after lie they took us to the same sales presentation you hear every time you visit just to see if we wanted to upgrade to the Grand Luxx with the promise to fix our issue, we were just very unhappy because it seemed we needed to hear their sales presentation in order to fix what we were promised. It was 1:00 pm already, finally the Mayan Palace manager (not the Grand Mayan Manager - we are owners of Grand Mayan) came with an option on regards to the beds, He said we will give you another room so you guys can have three beds as we promised but you need to pay maintenance, What?????!!!??? It was just unbelieveable to hear that. We suggested to take out the king bed and put two queens insted which they did. They promised to take two hours but it took them 4 so we just lost one full day from our 7 day vacation. We talked about this issue to one hotel person after another, it seemed the next person would care and take accountability but all of them said let me bring my next manager, the next manager listened and then said can't do anything for you. At this sales presentation the fourth person we talked to before the Mayan Palace Manager came, her name is Angeles, we asked her why internet was so expensive? and She answered in a very sarcastic way that offended us \"Well, we charge this much because our clientele has the capacity to pay\", not acceptable. We just walked out. We found ourselves explaining all of these events to the next manager and nothing happened. It seemed they just wanted to listen to you calmly so you would let go, vent out and then again the same story can't do anything for you. If someone from Mayan Palace/Grand Mayan is reading this please do something about your customer service. Customer service is not only listening but being proactive. Don't make us think that because we already own the time-share that we are stuck and that you don't care. An appology for all these problems is not enough. I'm not sure how many times we talked about our issues. We talked to resort clerks, concierges, sales people, managers and got nothing. We just lost our precious vacation time talking about it. We definintely are not going back to Cancun to this resort as we were not treated the way we should have and further more we are now talking about selling it or vacationing at other time-share resorts or even all-inclusive resorts too.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, Belgium", "Title": "\u201cGrand Mayan total worth it!\u201d", "Author": "Ss123_11", "ReviewID": "UR118085906", "Content": "Awesome hotel!!!

We practicly had the entire place to ourself it seemed like, that is till a tram would come. We rarely had to wait too long but it was a major inconveniance. I'm not opposed to walking but my 2 yr old is. Otherwise the walk wouldve been fine and a few times it wouldve been much faster. We did like to ride the open air one. The van was a bit too intimate. Email ahead and get the shuttle to pick u up at the airport. Those timeshare people I read about are NO JOKE! Walk straight out the doors and find the guy. All the drivers from all hotels are helpful in this way. Also try to get a room in buildings 1-7 to avoid long waits back to ur room. A couple of times our dinner plans got botched because a restaurant was closed for a private event and then we couldn't get a reservation at the other places. If u have a room with a kitchen beware of ants. One of the best parts of the trip for us was getting the photgraphy they offer. ( a bit pricey but we found it worth it to us). The pictures are stunning! Oh and the staff are super sweet. If you can manage, ask for Gerry he did so awesome with our 2 yr old she wanted to go say hi to him everytime we went near the pool. Gerry pirahna she called him. Happy hour is key if u wanna be on the cheap. We'd order several drinks at a time especially right before happy hr ended.

Upon arrival, the staff was very helpful and it was a quick process getting into our beautiful room complete with a kitchenette, living area and jacuzzi tub that NEVER RAN OUT OF HOT WATER! Ladies, you also get free little herbal soaps and oils that smell of rosemary and goodness:-) I don't believe any of the rooms are near water, so if you like the nearness of the ocean thing, you probably don't want to book here, but.., the grounds are so beautiful that they cancel out the fact that you must walk to the beach. There ARE shuttles that drive around the grounds to get customers from place to place, but there could have been more efficiency about the amount of shuttles AND speediness of getting people around. The grounds seem to go on forever and you will do a lot of walking if you miss your shuttle, but my husband and I enjoyed getting to know the area and exploring (along with getting much needed exercise after stuffing ourselves at the buffet/drinking at the AWESOME swim up bar!) The food at the breakfast buffet was very good and there was a wide variety of both American style breakfast food and Mexican foods to choose from along with fresh fruit juice that is made to order! There is also a grocery store (although expensive) on the resort grounds for those of you with a kitchenette! To save some money, we rented a car from HERTZ, which actually had an ofice at the resort for convenience (for a very LOW rate) and we drove into Playa to Walmart where we did some grocery shopping. We made fish tacos and margaritas on our second evening there! You will save some money if you purchase the bulk of your alcohol at Walmart. For the rest of the lazy days at the GMRM, my husband and I relaxed on the beach, which you will need swim shoes for. Although the beach is beautiful, the terrain under the water is rocky and dotted with coral and clam shells that are very sharp. We swam a bit but thanked ourselves for bringing our shoes too. You MUST walk this beach at night! Millions of stars in a navy blue sky and such a romantic atmosphere with the palms swaying in the breeze. As for the swimming at the facility's pools,..AWESOME! So many pools to take a dip in as well as cute little swim up bars that offer 2 for 1 happy hour drinks from 11-1. Such delicious tropical drinks are served at the swim up bars,.. and you MUST have the coconut monkey! A bartender actually runs off to knock a fresh coconut off a tree and then proceeds to peel/break it to make a tasty and very alcoholic coconutty beverage for you! He even decorates it with fresh fruit to look like a monkey's face. Good for pics too! As for things to do outside the resort, you MUST visit Playa del Carmen. My hubby and I went shopping on Fifth Avenue after taking one of the resort shuttles in to the town. We ate some freshly made quesadillas upon arrival and then shopped to our hearts content! There are Mexican beer vendors everywhere on the streets, so you can sip an ice cold Corona while you peruse. Plenty to shop for too, as the street seems to go on for at least a mile and a half.

I traded his place for this one using RCI, after I read some of the outstanding reviews about the place. I am very skeptical of five star ratings, as too many people are willing to give one out to resorts that are only so-so. I looked at their website and it looked pretty nice, so I decided to take a chance. Well, my wife and daughters and I were dumbfounded. We had a two-bedroom condo in the part of the resort called the \"Grand Mayan Jungle\". My wife was at first disappointed when she learned that the Jungle was, well, facing the Jungle, and there was no significant view of anything else. Definitely NOT an oceanfront view, or anything like that. She got over that really quick, though, when she saw what the rooms were like. They seemed huge compared to the 'virtual tour' of the website we had viewed online! The rooms had polished marble floors, and countertops, a well-appointed kitchenette with everything you need to cook you own meals, a nice bar/counter, etc. The bedrooms each had large, deep garden tubs and comfortable beds and furnishings. We walked out onto our patio, and were shocked to see that each Master suite in the building had it's own small swimming pool! Larger than an average hot tub, but unfortunately, not heated. Still, we were amazed. Little did I know that the best was yet to come. On the first evening, we decided to walk through the pool area. It was nothing less than the Garden of Eden, recreated. The \"little\" pool was the largest pool I had even seen in my life, multiplied by 50. It would take hours to circumnavigate it. It was actually an interconnecting network of many, many pools, all just 3-5 feet deep, with somthing like a lazy river to connecting them. Inside many of the smaller pools, there were rings of seats with water jets like a jacuzzi, and each one would easily seat from as few as 8 people to as many as 30 or more! Surrounding each of the pools was a gorgeously manicured jungle, comfortable beach chairs, many cabanas, and beds. Yes, there were thick comfortable beds throughout the pool area! The pool at night was an awesome, tranquil sight--around the pools there were underwater lights that changed color, lighting the water with hues of blue and green. Could heaven possibly be a more peaceful and enjoyable? The \"large\" pool, closer to the ocean, had it's own unique character, with an upper infinity pool, three larger, lower tiers, each one spilling into the others. There were swim-up pool bars, in several different locations throughout the pools. The pools in this resort could easily have served THOUSANDS of guests at the same time, and yet leave no one feeling cramped in the least! In front of the resort was the best-designed beach I have ever seen, as well--with cabanas in a buffer zone between the beach and the pools, and the ocean front was covered by hundreds of beach chairs. My wife is the kind of person who likes to go to reports and do nothing. She complains that I am always so intent on activities that we finish our vacation needing a vacation. Well, until I saw this place, she was right about that! Not anymore-- I can't imagine a better, more idyllically perfect setting to escape to to get away from the stresses of the world. She will never have to fight me to take a vacation here, and I'll be perfectly content to never leave the place except for an occasional scuba dive. Everything about this place oozed of luxury.

This is expected when people are in and out of the water and it's hot and humid. It's musty anywhere tropical! We stayed in building 3 and walking to the pools, lobby, and beach was easy every day. We never took a shuttle once around the hotel. While most said the restaurants were expensive, I found them to be pretty reasonably priced. My husband and I don't have exotic taste buds and stuck to burgers, sandwiches, pizza, and quesadillas all about $10-$12 US. Pretty good! The shuttle into Playa was $5 each way-- we went in twice. One night for the playacrawl, highly recommended and another night for walmart/beach. The shuttle was easy to pick up at the hotel and ran on a predictable schedule. The 2 for 1 happy was awesome and we hit it up almost every day! The service was great, they even came out to the beach to take orders. Sometimes during the day they offer free drinks through games and activities. We loved the drink making activity which included lots of free drink samples! Plenty of opportunities for free shots! :) The one negative was no nightlife at the resort but we made our own fun. The only problem was at 10:30 we got a call that our neighbors complained about the noise-- the walls must be thin because we were just playing a drinking card game with about 8 of us. All in all a great stay, the resort was beautifully manicured and the pools were gorgeous and refreshing-- we spend the whole day practically pool side. I will agree with others about the beach but we enjoyed it! Played some volleyball as well. Just walk the 15-20 minutes up to the nicer beach (to the left facing the ocean) and enjoy! It's gorgeous!

It's a gorgeous resort and well-maintained. Yes, it is a large resort, but my wife and I walked everywhere and never bothered calling for the shuttles at all. We left our 3 kids (ages 3 and under) at home with the grandparents, so we enjoyed the walks, holding hands and catching up on months of conversations. The rooms are 5-star and super clean. Yes, the beds are bit harder than we would have liked, but we had no problem sleeping (see aforementioned 3 kids under the age of 3). Here are a few favorite recommendations from the reviews: - Call or email the concierge for the free shuttle from the airport to the hotel. Make your way past the sea of timeshare sharks, go out the doors, cross over the road, and out on the covered sidewalk, you'll find the Grand Mayan rep with blue shirt and Grand Mayan logo. Arrange the return shuttle with the concierge before you leave. It's the least expensive option. - Ask for buildings 1-6. They are definitely closer and more convient. We weren't able to get a room in those buildings, but again we enjoyed our walks. - The palaypa rentals were the way to go for us. Reserve one the night before for $30, but it automatically goes toward food/bar tab. Nothing like falling asleep on a bed poolside, after a nice lunch and a couple margaritas! Reservations are taken at the restaurant at the left side of the pool (as you walk out the Jade gift shop). -Happy hour poolside is 11am-1pm. 2-for-1 drinks. You get a double-sized drink for the price of a regular drink. -Breakfasts at the Green Break, right along golf course, were delicious and moderately priced. -Dinner at Italian restaurant above the Jade was awesome. -Take shuttle from resort into Playa del Carmen for a day. Great restaurants, shops, and beaches. -SInce it is a cashless resort, everything is charged to the room. Had no issues with incorrect charges to the room. For those concerned, you can ask for a print out of your charges each day to check for accuracy (rather than wait to the last day to try and remember everything).", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wayland, Massachusetts", "Title": "\u201cThis place is huge\u201d", "Author": "Randi808", "ReviewID": "UR117155274", "Content": "If you like getting wet, the Grand Mayan is the place for you.

The other buildings accommodations are the same, but they are far away from the center where all the \"stuff\" is. So, if you can, take the advice and request the close buildings.

It took two hours to get through immigration, Delta lost all five pieces of our luggage, and it took over an hour at the car rental place! BUT the days that followed were great! The resort is sprawling, beautifully maintained, and the pools are awesome. The pools do get hot in the heat of the afternoon though! Mexico is HOT in August! Bring lots of sunscreen! The decor of the resort is Mayan themed and stunning. We ate at 7 of their restaurants- Gong, Tramonto, Havana Moon, Balche', Jade Deli, Breakfast buffet, and Frida's. We enjoyed all of them. Service was excellent and food was particularly good at Tramonto & Gong. Jade is the gift shop that has a small grocery store and a sandwich & dessert place. Their sandwiches are quite good! They have a mexican themed breakfast/brunch buffet every morning that is quite expansive (lots of choices). There is no air conditioning at this restaurant, so by the end of breakfast you are sweating a bit but it overlooks the lagoon. The staff was friendly and helpful. The poolside water aerobics was fun. Our kids played pool volleyball several days. They seem to have fun activities for the younger children. There is a smaller shaded pool where the water is cooler but it gets crowded with lots of little kids. The beach is not really a swimming beach though you can snorkel if you have equipment- water shoes would be good. A highlight of our trip was being able to release baby sea turtles on the beach so they could safely make their way into the ocean. It was amazing! This area is a HUGE nesting place for loggerheads and sea turtles! It made my trip! We had a Grand Master Suite that was very spacious. We did have some problems with ants in our room but ants can be tricky to get rid of once you get them. People bring them in the room from their bags that they bring back from the pool or beach or people leave food out. The problem was attended to when reported, though it did not solve the problem.

Check with concierge they have a binder with all the menues including a pizzeria menu which can be delivered to your room, but for some reason this is not available on the room service menu. found out about it by accident. Be prepared to walk A LOT. have shuttles. Grand Mayan shuttle takes you to Grand Mayan lobby which is close to Grand Mayan pool, but another 5 min walk to large pools and beach.

The Gran Mayan has an huge bedroom (1 Bedroom), with a sitting area and flat screen tv as well as a jacuzzi in the bedroom. The sitting area-living room, has 2 sofas, and each of the sofas have a pull out bed, in addition to an individual chair and table. The eat in kitchen had 3 bar stools, and 4 sitting places for the table. The terrace is quite spacious, with 2 pool chairs, small table, and the incredible dipping pool, by far my favorite spot. The first day we arrived we did not have a car, so we opted to buy a few groceries at their convenience store. Somewhat higher than regular grocery prices, but not excessive. They have a mini deli, and once again prices were not very excessive.The exlusive pools(2) for the Gran Mayan are just incredible, quite a bit of foliage. When we got there, after 1:00 there were a few beach beds available, they also have a swim up bar, and my understanding, happy hour is between 12:00-1:00. Of course, if you want to go where there is more activity you can always go to the main pool, where they also have some small wares for sale. Unfortunately, we were under the impression that the beach was still the same as 2006, and yes, the beach is still rocky, but now it has many palm trees, and a new bar as well as a pier. When we actually ventured, it was our last day there, so now we are determined to go back. The service was just wonderful. The cleaning ladies would even organize our \"stuff\". You get a complimentary pick up at the airport, but you need to let them know in advance-let the concierge know, and then you need to print the letter sent to you by concierge, and give to the shuttle. Shuttle price back to airport is $30-$35. One suggestion, if you do plan on renting a car, Hertz is available at the Mayan Palace, and Avis is located at the Gran Mayan. We actually got a taxi from the resort to Playa del Carmen, and rented a car in Playa., go to 5th Avenue, take a left from Constituyentes (same street as Comercial Mexicana-big Grocery Store) and walk about 4 blocks and take right,(sorry can't remember the name of the rental place) they gave us multiple options and gave us a better deal than resort. Nothing beats having your own transportation, and yes keep an eye when they are fueling your car, but also remember to tip the guy that is doing this, as well as the person bagging your groceries, they are terribly underpaid in Mexico. Also, don't take your insurance agent' word when they say that you are covered w/ liability in Mexico, more than likely this is not the case, unless you live on the border of the US/Mexico, or unless you have the Gold or Silver AMEX card. Excellent roads, and just very straight shot to Playa to the resort or Tulum, or Xcaret. If you don't want to hassle w/ taxis, and rentals, there are buses that drive by the resort, but you have to walk about 1/2 mile to the entrance of resort, and then you have to cross the highway so unless you are young and can run/walk fast, i would not recommend it.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salt Lake City, UT", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort, but wouldn't go twice\u201d", "Author": "JenniJae", "ReviewID": "UR116811953", "Content": "It earns it's 5-star resort title, and I suppose if you have money to throw around and like these types of place, this is the resort for you. I'll just share my experience so you can decide if it's what you're about. The pools are pristine and huge and you'll enjoy exploring them. We didn't see any deeper than about 4 feet, so don't plan on doing any diving. But they have tile chairs for you to actually lay in the pool in shallow water to keep you cool. There are also plenty of chairs around the pool for sunbathers. The pool part of the resort gets an A+ The rooms are big and beautiful. The beds are a little firm, but I prefer it a little firmer and felt great sleeping there. We had the grand suite, which is the combination of a smaller suite and larger suite with kitchen. If you're staying in the smaller suite, know that if anyone is talking in the hallway at any kind of volume, you'll hear it like you're sleeping in the hallway. Fortunately I brought earplugs, so it only bothered me the first night, but I certainly couldn't sleep without it. The kitchen suite room is better for the lighter sleepers since the main door isn't directly connected to the room. Internet is EXPENSIVE here, we never used it. In Playa del Carmen's main park you can use it for free, as well as many cafes. The staff expect a tip for nearly every little thing they do. Basically they view it as if you can afford to stay there (even if you did it via timeshare) you can afford to throw out cash like Warren Buffet. The maids will want a tip at the end of the week, bellboys for helping you with your luggage, even the guy taking you to the airport when you're done. Also, if you use the bottled water in the rooms, you'll be charged for it (and they'll probably try to charge you for it if you don't, like they did for us--check your final bill carefully). They'll tack on a room tax at the end of your stay, about $5-6 USD per night. Want to use the laundry? You have to buy tokens at the main desk (which can be a bit of a walk depending on your building), which a guest told us was about $8 for wash and dry. We just bought one of those hand soap bars at the grocery and used the washboard sink for free. They have a shuttle service to take you into Playa, which is reasonably priced and convenient. It's $5/person one way (as of this review). But you can also catch a \"colectivo\" or bus out on the highway by flagging them down and go for about $2/pp instead. Then once in Playa, just ask around for the Playa Express, or if you can hop in on a shuttle (I think on 2nd Av, just up from the ferry) which ranges from $2-3 USD (or $20-30 pesos). Taxis are the most expensive. You can take an ADO second class bus and they'll stop right by the resort if you're coming in from the airport or Playa. The resort offers a free shuttle from the airport, but it's about $16USD back to the airport. The beach is rocky at best, although there are some places you can swim, like if you go further left of the resort. Snorkeling is decentish, but all the good snorkeling is out where the waverunners are. If you go to the line, you'll find these metal balls with holes in them and some large fish and coral, just be careful of the waves which may bash you against them. I got a little bashed, but used my hands to take most of the damage, and touched one of the spikey ball sea creatures. Life guards were extremely unhelpful, more of a fix-it-yourself attitude. Even the concierge was like, well, maybe you can find tweezers in the boutique (and considering the size of the resort, the running around gets tiresome). Of course, the boutique didn't have any either, so we ended up having to visit the on-site doctor just to get a couple slivers out... Anyways, I wasn't super impressed. We ate at Frita's, which was good and the service was great. They let us take it to go and we ate it at the pool bar to stay cool. I think when you're ready to spend money, they treat you like a king, when you need something that doesn't typically cost money, good luck. It's a super out of the way resort, so if you're interested in scuba diving and visiting Playa, it may not be the best location. If all you care about is laying out by the pools and happy hour, you'll probably love the place. I only stayed there because my parents timeshare points were expiring that they said they wouldn't be able to use. When I do Cancun again, I think I'll stay at a 3-star or less hotel. We stayed at a 2 1/2-star place in Chichen Itza before checking in to the Grand. It had free wi-fi, breakfast, and free shuttle to the ruins. If you're more about exploring the city, I'd say skip the resorts.

It seemed like there were a million pools, so it wasn't super crowded. We never had trouble finding a chair to lounge in.

My husband and I took a vacation with some friends to Playa. The first few days we were in Playa we stayed at the Royal Haciendas. It was absolutely wonderful! Then we transitioned to another resort just to try it out. After day one I wanted to go back to the Royal Haciendas. The Grand Mayan is as we would say in the south \"too big for its britches\". It is a maze of confusion! It is poorly laid out and our room had absolutely no view. Not to mention a swarm of mosquitos from the nearby lagoon. The first day I had to wait until someone wanted to go to the pool with me because if I left and went by myself no one would ever find me. You can choose to walk to the pools or go on their little golf cart shuttle service (that never came on time). Then I walked down to the beach. I was devastated. There were slimy rocks lining the beach with snails all over them. I did not fly thousands of miles to go to a beach front resort that had no beach! The pools are huge but there are pools at home. In the hotel description it says that there is a full kitchen, not true. There is a mini fridge and a stovetop. That is all. I had to call the front desk and ask them to bring plates and bowls. They make it quite obvious that they do not want you to eat in! The food at the restaurants was decent but highly over priced. The fish tacos were 130 pesos and the alcoholic drinks were 70 pesos. It is a lot of food and I recommend splitting it with someone to get the best deal. I took three cold showers while I was there because there was no hot water. The jacuzzi was nice but the stopper did not work. By this point I started to get upset. I'm not a person to call and complain, I've only sent my food back at a restaurant once in my life. But between the beach, the view, the mosquitos, the kitchen, no hot water, and not being able to use the jacuzzi tub I was pissed. I took a minute and calmed myself and politely called the front desk to let them know about the jacuzzi situation and the hot water. No one ever came to fix the tub and I waited about an hour for the hot water to catch up because I was done taking cold showers. I called the front desk and unloaded on one of the managers about how unhappy all six of us were. He told me to fill out a survey when I checked out! He never even offered to make sure my tub got fixed. If I were a cartoon my face would have turned red and steam would have blown out my ears! So needless to say we began to plan more things to do away from this terrible place. They charge $5 each way on the shuttle into Playa ( The Royal Haciendas offered this service for free). The cab ride for four people was 220 pesos each way. I planned a tour with an out side tour company and they would not let my driver in the gates we had to walk about fifteen minutes to the gates to meet our driver. I'm sure it was because we did not use their overpriced tour service. But we got a trip to Akumal for less than half what they would have charged. At checkout they tried to tack on a 6 dollar charge for the little golf cart shuttle service. I got that taken off because it was not mentioned anywhere in my agreement. I'm sure there are more things that I left out but I think this is the worst review I have ever written on anything! Point made. In summary if The Grand Mayan Palace cut anymore corners they wouldn't have anything left to offer. Stay at The Royal Haciendas! Its cheaper, nicer, every room has a view, the beach is clean, it is closer to town, and the employees are very happy there.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Palm Springs, California", "Title": "\u201cTOO BIG for my liking\u201d", "Author": "BeachLover92260", "ReviewID": "UR116526799", "Content": "this place is huge...we stayed in a gorgeous unit overlooking the golf course..but when we wanted to get to the beach, a van picked us up and took us to lobby, then we hopped on a little shuttle to the pool area to go to beach..I felt like I was back in california and DIsneyland. to say something positive, the staff was friendly and when our guys came home with fish they cooked us a great meal to go along with the fresh catch!", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jackson, Missouri", "Title": "\u201cGreat place, no complaints, can't wait to go back\u201d", "Author": "Craig030", "ReviewID": "UR116450551", "Content": "The property is big and beautiful.

Our room was great, smelled fine, was perfectly cool and had clean towels everyday. Now stuff you need to know: Beach - Sand portion is great. Nice soft sand with plenty of chairs under the palm trees to get some shade. Water portion....lets just call it unusable. The reef runs right up to the beach here so there is no place to swim. The second you step in the water you are on rocks. That being said we took a walk up the beach (to the left of the resort and towards Cancun) and found a beautiful beach in front of another resort, The Valentin. It seems far, but stick with it as you will no be able to see the beach till you round the corner before it. And trust me you will know when you find it. Distance - This was our major pet peeve. We did not think we would be going to Playa Del Carmen as much as we did, so I was not overly concerned with the distance when booking. That being said I wish I had been closer to Playa. We loved going there to eat and shop as the prices are half of that at the resort and the food was amazing. They locals are friendly and give you much better service at the resort for half the cost. Plus with all the restaurants/bars at Playa allow you to eat with your toes in the sand, something the resort can not offer unless you are eating out of a plastic togo box. Try and use the hotel shuttle as it is only $5 US a person each way. You could try public transportation, but we didn't so I can't offer any advice. Food - Like I said above the resort is expensive. We ate in Playa and could get breakfast at a table on the beach for around $12 US for the wife and I. Our breakfast at the resort was $25 US and we sat looking at a wall. We didn't really wast to much at the resort, but in a pinch we would eat at the Deli inside Jade. Good sandwich, but not really authentic Mexico by any means. One last thing on food. Be adventurous. We ate at multiple small local spots to include street vendors and did not get sick. We drank tap water and did not get sick. My wife's favorite was the fruit at the Playa's town square by the ferry. Every night a bunch of vendors selling cups of huge fruit spears for $2 US. She said it was the best pineapple and mango she has ever had. And she is from Hawaii. ATTENTION: Avoid the beach restaurant Fusion. I ordered off the Spanish language menu and learned half way through my breakfast I had eaten half of a HORSE steak. Yeah my wife was less then pleased. Time Share Presentation - We opted to do the presentation knowing what was in store for us. It was exactly like people said. Took to long and was way high pressure. Everyone treated us well except one lady who was horrible. She was condescending and very rude. Tried to make me feel dumb for not buying and that I was stupid for passing up a good deal. Oh well, didn't buy and got $100 US and another 10% off our bill (Check to make sure they applied this to your bill at the end. It is not automatic even though they said it was). Plus got to buy excursions at cheaper rates. We took advantage of this and went to Chichen Itza for $35 US a person. Read below. Trips - We took a trip to Chichen Itza and to Xel Ha. Chichen Itza was good, but the Cenote swim after the tour was amazing. So Chichen Itza is overcrowded with people and is a pain to see everything in the time allotted. We ditched out on the tour guide and went out on our own and barely saw everything in time. Get a map offline or from someplace before you go. The layout is confusing and its not hard to miss things. We had to ask for directions multiple times and wouldn't you know it every answer was different about how to get to one spot. The Cenote was well worth it. It's a bit crowded with some people who are not great swimmers, but get away from them and you will really enjoy it. Bring a towel and $50 pesos to purchase a locker. Don't be afraid to take your camera down there its safe and you will want it. Check out - If you have a late flight ask for a late check out. We got ours changed from 10AM to 12PM with out a charge and be sure to reserve a Hospitality Room with the Concierge before hand. We didn't but they still fit us in to a vacant room for 30 mins so we could shower and change our clothes for our flight . Very handy. All and all a good place to stay. Wouldn't stay there again, but only because it was expensive and not close to Playa. Its just not our scene is the best way to put it. If you want easy accessible food, a HUGE pool, a sandy beach and great service with out concern for cost or leaving the resort then this is the place for you. If you want the local experience, good cheap local food, ease of transportation to the other areas and great service then stay closer to Playa Del Carmen at a cheaper place.

I decided to buy a big gallon of water (the best brand water is Bonofont). We rented a car the next day for $65 and drove to Playa del Carmen. We enjoyed the beach, cheap food, the locals etc. We rented jet skies and they were a waste of money...they were slow and old. We were told to go to the grocery store in Playa del Carmen called Chedrauii (I'm not sure if that's how you spell it) we bought milk, water, cereal, sandwhich stuff, and called it good. It was much cheaper than the grocery store at the resort. All the staff were great, polite, and the majority spoke English, with the exception from the grocery store staff. The room was amazing, always clean, very nice and cold, no smell at all, always had clean towels. The italian rest. was delicious and worth the money!!!! The \"Green Break\" was very very good too! We went there twice for breakfast because we loved it so much! \"Frida\" rest was very good too. The only problem with the majority of the rest. is that it's an outside rest.

Restaurants at resort were fine just double in price with what you can eat for in town. Beach was rocky but beautiful, no where near as perfect as Cancun. We were also surprised by the few numbers of English speaking vacationers. It was almost impossible to strike up a conversation at the pool when 90% of everyone there speaks Spanish. We always enjoy talking to others about their travels, thoughts on RCI etc but it was next to impossible at this resort which was a downer.

The resort is fairly large, lots of property and a beautiful lake. The resort provides a shuttle for people who do not want to walk to the pool and restaurants from their building.

The pools are fantastic, they are all free form and one lead into another with little waterfalls and never ending pools. They are kept very clean. The grounds are very beautiful too but beware of the mosquitos in the evening due to the fact that there is some stagnant water around the treed areas. I highly recommend bringing bug spray. Some of the restaurants are open air and the mosquitos are around there at night too. The food is very good and there is entertainment nightly at Havana Blue and also at the buffet restaurant. Havana Blue is actually the most reasonably priced restaurant at the resort. They have a great deal with their palapas. They rent them out for the day but if you buy food or drink from the pool bar or pool restaurant during the day they actually wave the price and you don't have to pay it. I think it was round $30.00 you had to spend. What a great deal! There isn't much entertainment during the day but they do have the typical pool aroebics and volleyball and usually some kind of game in the afternoon. The beach was nice but was very rocky and very difficult to get into the water to swim. Our room was very musty smelling, the staff tried very hard to remove the smell, they even brought in an Ionizer and they told us to increase the air conditioner, it did help but there still was an odor.

Or the days that we'd order one entree for dinner and split it. Also, as far as being \"romantic\"... forget it! This place is crawling with kids, old folks, and the likes. Because the hallways are tiled the acoustics are horrible and you can hear people in the halls, next room over, upstairs, etc. Being adventurous, it would have been nice to get to rent a kayak or boat for the day, but the resort offered none of that. Only jet skis that cost about $175/hr to rent. I never saw these used. Seems like they could make more money if they lowered their prices.

I felt completely nickle and dimed. (seriously, 10 packets of splenda stapled together for 9 pesos? could you just give me 2?)

Also, we were in building #1 and had very easy access to the beautiful pools for Grand Mayan residents. Pools were warm and well kept. Service around the pools was exceptional. Both the service staff and the activities personnel were outstanding. (Particurlarly Paco, Angel and Lili). Professional and caring. We were treated very well. The beach was also beautiful to look at. I thought that the food was outstanding, although we mostly ate at the pool or Blue Fish restaurant, and one night at the Mexican Fiesta buffet. Other than that, we had sandwiches (peanut butter) or snacks in the room. Bad: We went to Playa del Carmen to swim in the ocean. The ocean swimming at the resort was terrible. Unlike others, we walked to the front gate and caught the public bus down to Playa several times instead of using a cab. $40 pesos ($4.00 USD) for two of us. We also did our shopping in Playa, and then caught the \"bus\" back. Easy and cheap. We then either walked back from the front gate or caught a free ride on the shuttle. We also caught the bus to Playa once, took the ferry to Cozumel, and went scuba diving (2 tank dive, including a dive on San Franciso reef), had lunch in Cozumel, and then back to Playa, and the bus back to the resort. This took less than a full day, and cost much less than the hotel wanted for a 2 tank dive that did not include a dive on a world famous reef!

The presentation started with a proposal to purchase 8 weeks real estate \"fractional ownership\" for $277,000 (Luxx) and ended at the bargain price of $5600 USD for 5 weeks (Mayan Palace). But we would have to give up RCI (no longer any ability to trade for any other resorts in the RCI system), and the substitute trading system (I don't recall the name) had very nice properties but much more limited--particularly in the areas that we like to travel (mostly beach areas in the US). And you trade paying maintenance fees for paying usage fees (at the same price).

The food is great and there is lots of it, so my husband and I often split a salad or a pizza or even a main dish. That is no problem at all. If you desire Spa services, please consider them because the staff and the treatments are wonderful. Not inexpensive!!!! Nothing at that resort is inexpensive, but also nothing is outrageously priced. My husband was able to scuba dive 5 days out of our week (no scuba on Sundays) and saw wonderful fish life in the near by reefs. A dive shack being on the property makes it very convenient to do so.

Located about 20 minutes north of Playa del Carmen and about 40 minutes south of the Cancun airport in a more laid back area of the Riviera Maya compared to hotel row in Cancun. As mentioned in the other reviews this is a large resort with golf course and also includes the Mayan Palace resort as well. There are 13, three story buildings for GM with buildings 1-7 being closer and a 2-10 minute walk to the pools, beach, restaurants. The back buildings are much farther away and can be walked to or golf carts-small trams will take you to lobby in a timely fashion. This was an RCI exchange for us and they typically will place you at the back of the property. Don't pay attention (or take the tour) to the time share sales people and you will be fine. We were at first placed in Bldg 12 but having read the reviews here requested a closer building and were thankfully relocated to Bldg 4 (THANK YOU Jasmine @ front desk)! It made a huge differance to be closer to the amenities and on the 1st floor. We have done a lot of world wide traveling and have to say that the GM is very well run-managed and all staff are very friendly and well trained to make your stay wonderful. GM is a no cash (CC on file) self contained resort with numerous casual and formal restaurants including room service. All charges were correct which was impressive given how hard the 4 of us hit the swim up pool bars (thanks Rene & Umberto!), room service, etc. Meals are somewhat pricey but not unreasonable. The rooms are large and nicely decorated (rooms have kitchens and are stocked), grounds-landscaping and pool areas are amazing (see photos). Those that stay at GM have exclusive use of the Sanctuary Pool which is more private and laid back and much nicer than the main pool areas next to beach. The beach has sand areas & palm trees but water shoes are needed to swim in the ocean.", "Date": "July 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Service": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenville", "Title": "\u201cOne of the worst trips!!!!\u201d", "Author": "rhapsody1922", "ReviewID": "UR115661786", "Content": "The place is beautiful but it is way too expensive.

Be sure to ask for buildings 1-5. These are not so far and a short beautiful walk to the pools and El Lagro the buffet. At 8 every night there is a show at El Lagro, you do not have to eat there to watch the show. The show was amazing and on Tuesdays they have a Disney themed night for the kids. The average dinner for 2 is around 750 Pesos. The buffet ran us $33.00 per person and Frida's was really good, but I would recommend that breakfast be at there little coffee shop at the Jade Boutique. A breakfast sandwich will run you around $9.00 dollars a person, or room service. Cheaper than $24.00 per person at the buffet. The pools are really nice, but take the towels from your room and then just take them back. The towel place is super far from some of the pools. If you have scheduled excursions outside the hotel with another company, you have to meet them outside the resort on the road. We did two excursions and there were many people waiting, it is a 10-15 minute walk from the resort to the road or a $3.00 cab ride, your choice. We did not opt for the timeshare presentation b/c the 1.5 hours they promise we heard from numerous people it was 6 hours long. We puchased for 80 something dollars the Chichen Itza trip. I would highly recommend that you purchase it outside of your resort. We had a tour bus of people, with 2.5 hours there and two long stops, so people could use restroom and shop. Also, the tour bus was freazing cold going and coming. We got 90 Minutes to visit the ruins. We then went to eat at some restaurant (not very good and drinks were 3 dollars a piece for water and a coke), we then stopped at a Cenote where several other tour buses were and it was so crowded that many people did not swim, including myself. Then another 2.5 hours back to the hotel. I would recommend to pay the money and get a smaller tour with less people and more time at Chichen Itza. We did meet an amazing Cab Driver who took us multiple days around and was very reasonable and a wonderful person. His Name was Miguel, Cab 843, you can ask the front desk to look for his number as they wrote it down and we also called him ourselves, he spent the last day from 11:00 till 5:00 with us and only charged $90 dollars. He drove us past Akumal and back. He also met us at our building the day we were leaving to take us to the airport and only charged $34.00, a transport is usually $25.00 a person. Amazing. I will be posting his number for anyone who would like to use his services. Just call him the day before, as he has lots of people who are return customers.

Our large family was placed in three 2-bedroom units in buildings 5 and 6, fairly close to each other. There was a total of 7 adults and 5 young children in our group; the oldest child was 7. The units are very spacious, and when children wanted to spend the night in our unit, there were 3 available trundle beds for them (6 twin sized mattresses). Each bedroom had a king sized bed, and the bathrooms were very spacious, with double sinks and large tubs, one with jets. The living room was a comfortable size, and the kitchen was compact, but fine for us. A refrigerator (medium-sized) , microwave, coffee maker, toaster and blender were all available. The beds were firm, but very comfortable for all of us. The large pillows were too firm, so we used the smaller pillows (regular-sized), stored under the t.v. console in the living room, and they were comfortable. The cooling pool on the patio was used several times, especially when it was raining hard outside. We ate in most of the restaurants. Green Break had delicious breakfast food, and the Balche Grill (Frida's at night) was also excellent. There were many menu items to please both adults and children, from pizzas, hot dogs and quesadillas to delicious pulled pork, cooked over a wood fire. The wait staffs were very attentive and accommodating to all our needs. We also ate dinner at Havana Moon, down at the beach, one night (also excellent food), and took the kids there for dessert and dancing another night (after 8:00 P.M.) Our final lunch was at the cafe in the health gym and the food was excellent here, also. We had fresh, large salads, \"wraps\" and smoothies. We wished we had found it earlier in our stay. We loved the beach! It does have coral at the entrance to the ocean, but there were a couple of large pools in the coral, and the children busied themselves with finding sea stars, snails, clams, etc., as well as small fish. We also loved the swimming pools. There was never a shortage of chairs or beds. We sat in a different location every day, and especially liked the \"shade pool\" when the weather was very hot. Happy Hour was from 11:00 to 1:00 every day, and the waiters came around to serve everyone. The children were able to order virgin drinks 2-for 1 also. We also ate breakfast and lunch inside our unit on some days with food we purchased from Wal Mart in Playa. We also ordered pizza from \"Room Service\" twice. The price was the same, and we loved the pizzas! None of us were ever asked to take a tour or go to a timeshare presentation during the two weeks we were there. We rented a car in Cancun, but would rent it at the resort next time because we found there were days when we preferred just staying at the resort. We traveled, on different days, to Cozumel, Playa del Carmen, Coba, Tulum and Akumal. We had been to the Yucatan before, but it had been a while since our last visit. We went on the Hummer Tour, arranged by the concierge in the lobby, and found the concierge to be very efficient and helpful. They also checked us into our airline flights the day before we left. There are crocodiles and flamingos on the grounds at the resort, and we enjoyed visiting them many times. The staff at TGM is very friendly and would greet us each time we passed. Twice we needed things (phone couldn't dial out, t.v. remote needed batteries) and someone came to our door both times within five minutes to fix the problem (which they did, both times.) Then we received a follow-up call, both times, within 10 minutes, to check if the problem had been fixed. We were very impressed with service and attention to detail. The housekeeping staff was also very friendly, servicing us twice daily, and kept asking us if we needed anything. We will definitely go back to this resort. We do not own here, but traded in through SFX. It was the first time we had taken a family vacation with three of our kids and their families, and it worked out perfectly.

There is almost no ocean view from anywhere on the property! From what I can tell only the sample sales units have the only ocean view and all the other units are a long way back from the ocean. One restaurant has an ocean view. The only other building with an ocean view is the sales conference room (probably the best view on the property- big surprise). You need the shuttle to move around the resort. The lying by the resort sales staff is horrendous! To be treated in this way while on vacation is terrible. They were insulting, dishonest and out right lied! I do not trust this organization! I repeatedly complained to no response from the management.

We found other people's comments very useful when planning our trip, so here's everything I can think of that might be helpful: Getting there: We checked in late Sunday night; getting there from the airport was a breeze (to repeat the advice we got: ignore everyone who tries to offer you rides, walk outside the airport, cross a very small driveway/crosswalk and walk to the blue station Number 28. The driver will have a tan polo shirt and navy slacks on.) The woman at the front desk was friendly and efficient. We did get asked that night whether we were interested in the timeshare presentation; we assured the man we were not, and nobody ever hassled us about it again. Room: Our room (in building 9) was fantastic - very clean, and none of the musty smell that other comments have complained about. There does seem to be a bit of mustiness on the lower floors, but our second-floor room had no problems with it at all, and that may just be a function of a tropical environment. We left $5 every night for the maid, and never had a problem with cleanliness. No problems with theft, and in fact if you forget to close your room safe, they lock you out of the room until a security person comes by and verifies with you that nothing has been taken from the safe. This happened to us, and while it's annoying, it's reassuring too. (In fact, we had to start leaving notes so the maid knew the tips were for her; the first night we just left a five dollar bill on the table and she didn't take it.) Our room had a nice little kitchen, a jacuzzi and a plunge pool (awesome!), a great shower, etc. Beds were firm but comfortable. No problems with noise or anything. No ocean views, but we found we didn't miss them. High marks for the room. Staff: Everyone we met was very, very friendly. Not all of them speak English (including some of the restaurant workers; we found ourselves order crepes by pointing at the menu) but most do. Nightlife: little to none, as far as I could see. That may matter to you. We were on our honeymoon - we made our own night life. :-) Getting around: yeah, it's a big, spread out resort. You either spend a lot of time waiting for shuttles (which are sometimes full) or you walk, but the walking is not that bad. From our building to the pools was less than 10 minutes (and building 9 was not one of the closer ones). It's a very pleasant resort with nice walking paths, so this was not a problem at all for us, and in fact we really enjoyed the walks together. Water: We were told the water is drinkable, but we got ours either bottled or from the ice machine (which has a special filter). Here's the trick: get a bunch of ice. Stick in whatever container you can find; we used the pitcher, the salad bowl, etc. Let it melt over night. Presto! Ice cold drinking water. Worked like a charm, and we never got sick. Pools: Big and extensive, lovely and clean. We used the Mayan Palace pool the first day, but that's definitely a bigger and noisier pool. The rest of the week, we used the (smaller but, in our opinion, nicer) Grand Mayan pool. It's more secluded, it has a nifty infinity edge thing going - done. There's a rocky beach on the resort; nice for walking, bad for swimming. I've heard there's a great swimming beach not too far away, but we never made it there and anyway, the pools were lovely. If you have small children (or just want more to do) the Mayan Palace pools might be better than the Grand Mayan pools; there was definitely more going on over there. We were never there early enough to reserve a palapa, but no big deal; we never had problems finding comfortable seating in the shade, and anyway, nobody ever bothered us when we used the palapas anyway after the others left. :-) Alcohol: pricey, so we got our drinks during happy hour when they were 2 for 1. The drinks you get at the poolside restaurant are smallish, but the poolside bar drinks were big and generously alcoholic. You can also buy your alcohol in Playa del Carmen, although we never made it there. Neither of us are huge drinkers, and we did just fine with one or two drinks a day and sometimes wine at dinner. Food: We kept intending to go to Playa and buy some food and make our own dinners - really, we did. But we just never got around to it. :-) So all our meals were either from the on-resort restaurants, or leftovers. We liked Havana Moon for dinner - good food, fun entertainment. Tramonto was our \"fancy\" meal - it's an upscale (expensive) Italian restaurant; not the greatest gourmet meal I've ever had, but pretty good. We did Restaurant del Lago for breakfast once (although we never made it to dinner there); very nice breakfast buffet, but pretty spendy. Lunches at the Pool Bar are decent but unexciting (although you can't complain about the 2-for-1 drinks during happy hour). In the end, we probably at the most at Green Break, by the golf course; good food, and probably the best prices of any of them. Also, don't miss the amazing crepes inside Deli Jade. We got these our first night (it was late and not much else was open) but found them so good that we went back a few more times. Overall, we found that two meals a day (plus snacking on leftovers) was enough for us. Also, we brought microwave popcorn from home, which was great to have at night while watching\u2026 TV: There are several TVs in each room. Mostly it's Spanish language stuff, as you'd imagine; there's also an \"American\" channel that has a weirdly random selection of shows like the Ghost Whisperer and Dr. Phil. Money: as others have mentioned, this is a cashless resort - everything is charged to your room (so make sure you remember your room number!) It's a good idea to keep your receipts and make sure the final bill doesn't have any mistakes on it. Ours was fine, but I'd heard that other people had some errors. It's true that this is not the cheapest place you'll ever stay, but we found the price pretty reasonable for the amount we did. Excursions: we went to Selvatica and did the ziplining + dune buggy + cenote swimming. Ziplining was amazing. Cenote swimming was fun (although consider bringing a change of clothes). Wouldn't recommend the dune buggies though; they're uncomfortable and very dusty, and although they give you protective eye wear, it can't keep out the dust. My wife got dust in her contacts and spent the ride in agony. Other than that, our only trip out was a lovely sunset dinner cruise followed by a steak dinner under the stars. Getting there was tricky (there were issues with the shuttle that picked us up - they were late, they got our names wrong, etc) but the evening was really nice. Overall: this was a great resort and we had an amazing weekend there. If you're looking for tons of activities and nightlife, or you need access to a real beach, it might not be for you. But if you want a lovely relaxing time, I'd definitely recommend it.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort, well appointed, very expensive!\u201d", "Author": "mosinoi", "ReviewID": "UR114814369", "Content": "Stayed at the Grand Mayan just last week (June 19-26). We are a family of four with two teenagers. So where do I start? Check-in: I read on Tripadvisor that it can be a pain if you got a room in any bldg farther than 3. So, we kindly asked the receptionist to give us something closed to the lobby and the pools. We lucked out and got bldg 2, third floor. We had a two-bedroom, huge apartment, it sleeps 8, I believe. The balcony was big, the plunge pool a bonus. The bedrooms large and clean. The only downside was the musty smell, and I suspect there is mold in the air conditioning ducts. It smelled like it, and my kids are allergic to it and coughed while they stayed inside. I think that's the case with all the hotels in this area. It's very humid, it's the jungle. Other than that, it is a nice apartment and really big for four people. The cleaning girl came every day, and we tipped her $2 per room, per day. Did a nice job, but they don't clean the kitchen, not their responsibility. I guess if you tip them more, and ask them they can do it for you. Not many pan or pots in the kitchen, one fairly good knife, one pot and pan. You also get one paper towel, one bottle of dish washing detergent, one sponge, and one dish towel. There is a toaster, a coffee machine, and a blender. There's a small refrigerator, enough plates, mugs and glasses for 6 or 8 people, I don't remember. One room has a jacuzzi, the other has a bath tub. Both have dual sinks, separate shower and toilet. There is also a sink off the kitchen and an extra closet. There is a flat screen TV in every room, which was really nice, because everybody got to watch whatever they wanted. The grounds are well kept, the food at the restaurants that we tried (Blue Fish for lunch, Blanche at MP also for lunch, Frida's) was good but extremely pricey. The convenience store is also expensive. A pack of hot dogs was $70 pesos, milk was $40 pesos, and bread about the same. Not a great selection, but enough to get by. We took advantage of the happy hour, which was from 11-1, two drinks for the price of one. Lunch at the Blue Fish ran us $50 (dollars) with drinks. At Frida's for dinner we paid $140 (drinks included). Someone said that they didn't get a receipt when they dined. We always got one, and were never overcharged. Tip is included, but if we liked the waiter we always gave him an extra $5-$10. He never forgot us :). We didn't take the shuttle into Playa, instead we took taxis, which costs between $20 and $22. Some of the drivers spoke English well, and were very informative. One in particular we liked, and we tried to use all the time. We took the free shuttle from the airport to the GM, I e-mailed the concierge (e-mail is on their web site). We took a taxi back to the airport, which costs $37. The shuttle would have been $60. There was a laundry room on the second floor of the bdlg, $80 pesos to wash and dry. The token is only for the washer, drying is free. The washer is extremely small, doesn't wring the clothes to well. The dryer is decent, but you have to put in small loads of laundry if you want you clothes dry. by the way, the washing cycle is only about 30 minutes long. You get the tokens from the concierge and they also give you a plastic bag to put your laundry in, and detergent. We didn't use the spa, mainly because the prices were outrageous. A pedicure was $720 pesos (divide by 12 to get US dollars) and the rest of the services around there, too. This hotel has a no cash policy. They put a hold of about $8,000 pesos on your cc, and you charge everything to the room. One tip for families with teens: you can have them sign at check -in and you don't have to be with them when they buy drinks, snacks, or anything else they want. We did take the time share presentation, or sort of a presentation, because we own two timeshares, because we wanted the free passes to Chichen Itza and the 10% the bill. it was raining that day, so we had a few hours to kill in the morning anyway. We also got the free breakfast at Del Lago, which is excellent. The regular price there is $25 per person, and there is a great variety of foods. We didn;t walk to the gate, because it's a good mile, and with tow kids and 90F heat, it would have been tough. I did see some people waiting for tour buses, taxis or buses, outside the gate, but not too many. The pools are nice, the ones at the GM are elegant, but the ones at the MP aren't bad either. We ended up at the MP pools more often, because there was a lot more going on for the kids. By the end of the stay, we had spent $8,100 pesos, on mostly food and drinks. It is an expensive resort, but I can see why. Service is great, the grounds are nice (our kids went to see the flamingos and the crocodiles), staff is helpful. by the way, no ocean view for these building, jungle or golf course. We bought internet access for the week, $950 pesos. You can also buy it per day, don't remember how much it is, or go to the cyber cafe, which is right next to the store.

You can reserve beds, with shading, that are around the pools. You pay $30 USD, but you get a food/drink credit of $30. The breakfast buffet at the main restaurant is very good, especially the fresh fruits, but the price is a lot for Mexico. You can get breakfast for free if you go to a 3 hour timeshare presentation. There is another restaurant, by one of the parking lots, called Green something, which is reasonable for meals. They had some high end restaurants, but we have small kids and couldn't get last minute reservations. They had shows at the main restaurant, which were very entertaining. The was a shopping area in the building near the pool. The prices were reasonable. The service at the panini/sandwich shop in the shopping area was extremely slow. I think we waited 45 minutes for a sandwich. My wife and friend were disappointed with the Spa services. Apparently the menu seem to offer more than you actually got and it was expensive. Expensive for Mexico, not expensive for a resort. Most of the staff spoke decent English. The parking lot and security guys didn't speak English well, but attempted to be helpful. The Grand Mayan is the more luxurious of the two. GM has their own pool, for only GM guests, which is quiet compared to the main pools. GM also has a fake beach for kids and a shade area with beds and living room furniture to relax outdoors without sitting in the direct hot sun. The Grand Mayan kitchen has a bigger stove and refrigerator than the Mayan Palace ones. GM units also had a plunge pool on the balcony of our unit. The GM units seem farther to the pools than the MP ones, but we took the resort shuttle everywhere.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Covington, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cwe truely loved it\u201d", "Author": "barbie1437", "ReviewID": "UR114694657", "Content": "we had the most wonderful time of our life.i took my granddaughter,two nieces and one of their friends for graduation along with my husband and one of my friends.it was wonderful.i was very disappointed the night we got there because it was so much walking but by the second day it got much better.we stayed in the jungle and had no problem getting a golf cart,waited no longer than five minutes.it took you anywhere you wanted to go on the grounds.caught a cab to playa del carmen one day went shopping and ended up at senior frogs for a great party and wonderful view of the beach.rented a car one day and went to cancun old town,then to hotel zone for lunch and shopping the girls liked senior frogs so much that we went in cancun and it was great.the last night we stayed in cancun at fiesta americana villas.went to carlos and charlies,they were grieving because they weren't going to seniors frogs again but ended up having more fun there.it was all wonderful.they are wanting to go back next year.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cgreat resort\u201d", "Author": "scottydoesntkno", "ReviewID": "UR114653624", "Content": "it's a timeshare resort, so if you go, you know you are going to do the sales pitch thing and you can of course not do that part if you are strong willed, but they offer free golf, massage, discoutns etc to spend 90 minutes (which usually ends up being more). Anyway, once you are beyond that, the resort is great, it's very high class. there are actually a few different levels of units on the property, you have the Mayan Palace, which is lower scale, say 3 star, then the grand mayan, which is closer to 4 star, a studio unit gets you a pretty good size hotel room. The 1 bedroom gets you the same room, plus another equal sized room with a kitchen and living room and a pool outside on your balcony, or a 2 bedroom, which is all of the above put together. It's all very well apointed with full size double bath tub, large shower, 2 sinks in each bathroom with another exterior sink for the kids staying in the kitchen living room area, and of course granite counter tops and marble floors throughout. the furniture and artwork are all nice and up to date. Each room has a safe and a 40\"+ flat screen TV and a bose wave radio/CD. they give you plenty of dishes and cooking stuff, though they could use some measuring cups and condiments in the room. There is also the Grand Luxxe level which is 5 star type lodging and some other levels being built on the resort, or so they say. these are all located in different areas of the property, but they generally share the resort amenities. There is one giant multi part pool in the middle just above the beach that most people use. There are 2 other large and nice pools assigned to guests of the Grand Mayan, though I doubt they kick anyone out. There is a par 54 (all par 3's) golf course with carts and driving range on the property, iguana's everywhere, a nice beach with some snorkling if the waves are not up making it too choppy (bring water shoes, it's rocky in the water), about 7 or 8 restaurants featuring all kinds of food, a mini market that has just about everything you may need, a store with the standard resort stuff, towels, polo shirts, dresses etc. On the beach is a stand offering SCUBA, para sailing, jet skiing, snorkeling, etc. I did a SCUBA trip, and had a blast, 2 offshore 50' deep dives in different locations for 105 bucks. the resort is cash free, meaning you just sign for everything, no need to carry your wallet, though there are some things like 3rd party sales and tipping the scuba dive guys you may want cash for. There are crocodiles on the property, in some enclosures, don't worry, a large lake, and plenty of arranged activities for kids and adults alike that are free. There's a kids club that runs from 9-5 daily with activities for the little ones, though we were just before peak season and they didn't really stick to the schedule since the # of guests was lower than normal I guess. they have in pool bars, a really nice Brio Spa with massages, facials etc., and an onsite photography company that does a free one hour session with you and your family, touches up the 3-500 pictures they take, and they sits down with you to sell you a nice professional photo package, always bargain with them by they way, it'll get you a better deal, they aren't cheap, but they are no t bad either if you would like to get some great family photo's by real professionals. Anyway, just rambling off all I remember at the this time, but we had a great week there and I would reccomend it. It's $35 (20 minutes) to the airport by taxi, and $25 (15 minutes) to Playa del Carmen by taxi, or you can just stay on site and soak in the sun. Tours to everywhere else are of course available. Internet is not free, which sucks, though the grand mayan and up rooms do have computers in them and wireless is there too, they have a cyber cafe at $6 an hour as well. Food and drinks are on the pricey side too.

Based on the reviews that I had read on Trip Advisor, I was concerned that I would not be happy with the Grand Mayan. We found the grounds to be flawlessly manicured to the point that the sidewalks are dust mopped each day and the dirt raked; the room to be kept spotlessly clean with maids stopping by at least twice per day to clean the rooms and see if we needed anything else; the pools to be endless; the staff to be not only genuinely friendly but willing to do whatever it took to make us happy; and the overall hotel to be a pleasantly wonderful suprise. What were the downsides? The beach is rocky. I thought that this would be an issue for us, but found that we honestly did not care. We loved the pools so much that just being on the beach with the wonderful view was enough. We also had rented a car and spent so much time traveling and doing activiites on the beaches at other locations like Tulum that we did not miss it at all. Things that I would recommend: 1. Rent a car - not only did having a car make it more convenient to get around in Mexico, but we found it to be a great part of the adventure. There was no limit to where we could go and getting around was much easier than expected. 2. Buy food at Wal-Mart or the Mega - this saved us money and was suprisingly fun as I have NEVER seen a Wal-Mart in the states anywhere near as clean and neat as the ones in Mexico. You will also find the amazing fresh baked breads and pastries to be not only very affordable but also delicious. 3. Go to Akumal - Eat at La Buena Vida, go snorkeling at Yal-Ku Lagoon, and take in the breath taking beach. 4. Shop in the malls in Cancun - we found the prices to actually be cheaper than in other cities like Playa Del Carmen or Akumal and did not have to negotiate the prices. 5. DO NOT rent a car from Europacar - this was the only down side to our vacation. They tried to give us a rental car with the side mirror falling off of it and the entire right side covered in dents and scrapes. We spent about 2 hrs waiting to finally get a car that we thought would actually run. We later found out that we were the 3rd family that they had tried to give the wrecked car to. 6. Just say no when asked if you want to go to the timeshare presentation and you will not be bothered again. This was not an issue at all for us. We stayed in Building 1 and were very conveniently located to all of the pools, grounds, and activities. Having said that there is a lot of walking so keep that in mind if you have any limitations in mobillity. We found the beds to be comfortable. We locked valuables in the safe and had no issues with safety or security like mentioned in some other reviews. There are also safety deposit boxes available in the lobby if you feel like you needed additional storage. We would recommend the Grand Mayan to everyone and had a great time!

When planning this year's beach vacation, we once again chose this resort. Exchanged through RCI into a 2 bedroom, June 4-11, 2011. Called resort a week prior to our arrival and requested the courtesy shuttle to pick us up at airport. Had no issues identifying resort staff and we walked out to wait for the van. Waited 15 mins to get picked up. From airport to resort, it was about 25 minutes. Checkin was fast, not many guests checking in at 11pm. We were assigned building 11, which was in the Jungle section. I had previously called resort and requested buildings 1-7, but was told none available. We were tired and just wanted to get to bed. Early the next day, went to lobby and asked if they had any other rooms available... we got LUCKY and were assigned building 4. Not having to wait for the golf cart to pick us up was worth it. The rooms are very spacious, ours consisted of two Master suites with king size beds in each room, as well as a sofa with a pull out bed on the bottom. The living room also has another sofa with a pull out bed on bottom. Extra pillows and blankets are in the closets. Three individual A/C units were in our suites, nice cool rooms after a hot day by the beach/pools. Shower is separate from jacuzzi tub, and master bedroom has two sinks. Kitchen is well equipped with a 4 burner stove, toaster, blender, microwave,pots, pans, coffe maker, and a small refrigerator. Master bedroom had room safe on the top part of the closet and the other room safe was inside the living room TV cabinet on the bottom. We went to the breakfast buffet as Del Lago and it was delicious. Omelettes prepared to your liking as well as scrambled or over easy eggs..YUM!! Fruits, yogurt, cereal, french toast, pancakes, etc.. many items to choose from. The Mayan Sanctuary is a lovely, relaxing area when you want some peace and quiet. Never had an issue finding a pool chair or even a \"bed\" to hang out when using the pools. Waiters in the pool area are always walking around attending to guests. Happy hour is 11am to 1pm.. and everyday there is a drink of the day for 50% off all day. Lunch portions were big.. even my husband couldn't finish his cuban sandwich. The Mayan Palce pools are huge and had activities and games going on. The kids liked hanging out there since there was more room for them to use their inflatable tubes and loungers. The activity center by the pool can inflate them for you. The resort has a gift shop and small on site store called Jade. You can find many of your basic food items there as well as some medicines you may need. My son needed Benaydryl one day, and before heading out to Playa del Carmen I decided to stop by and see if JADE had some. Was glad to find out they had it and many other medications if I needed them. We also rented a van for $100 day in the Mayan Palace with all insurances included. We used the van when we went to Playa del Camen to buy some groceries as well as have dinner and stroll around town. Also went to Isla Mujeres, Xcaret, Akumal, Yak Kul Lagoon and had a nice dinner in Cancun at Rolandi's. Some people are hesistant to leave resort, but we never had an issue when we were out and about in town. Follow the speed limit and be careful with the speed bumps called \"Topes\" in Spanish. Last year, we got several phone calls to attend timeshare presentation. This year, we were not bothered once. We invited some friends to go with us, and they were in love with the resort. They could not believe how spacious their own 2 bedroom villa was. Housekeeping always did a very thorough job cleaning the rooms and we tipped them daily. Resort staff are all courteous and helpful.

There is a river that flows on the premises, this will be transformed into a motorised boating lake (they are working on this at present).There are various restaurants within the complete, not cheap about the same price as you would pay if you were at home, but the quality of one particular restaurant was outstanding. I am referring to the Italian restaurant on top of Jade boutique, there is also an Asian restaurant which was closed at the time.

They also take you to the front of the resort if you want to go into Cancun or Playa (Playa is about 20 minutes by local minibus priced at 20 paeso, and 40 paeso to Cancun which take about 40 minutes. I attend the Timeshare presentation (do this only if you want cheap car hire) if you dont, you will find your whole day will be taken up with it. A 90minutes presentation lasted 4 hours, we were exhausted with the rubbish sales pitch. Our 2 bed which they were offering us started off at US$25,000 but ended up at US$7,500 and they were going to throw in a cruise as well whether we won it or not. You will find you are passed onto 4 or 5 different sales consultant, who talks a lot of rubbish, in the end we didn't know what we were buying.

Spent June4-11the there. Very nice being there on off peak times as it was not crowded and the weather was still very nice (a few days of rain), but still great!! First a note about the location: If you Google Map the listed address for the Mayan Palace/ Grand Mayan/ Grand Luxxe which is (Km 48 Carretera Federal, Playa del Carmen 77710, Mexico), or you use the map it feature of this site, it brings you to the wrong location! It places the site in southern Playa del Carmen. In fact it is north. It lies between PDC and Puerto Moralos. (See pics). The resort is VERY beautiful and very spread out. There are three properties at this location. Mayan Palace which runs from the next to the pool and beach (building 1), nearly all the way to the main road along the golf course (building 21) About 1.1 km or 15 minute walk. Grand Mayan - the next level up and the ones we are members of. Buildings 1-7 are closer to the pool and beach, but still a bit of a walk. These units surround the lagoon. They are not on the lagoon, but you are near it. We stayed in building 4. Buildings 8-13 are further away along the southern edge of the golf course. Depending on what unit configuration you have, you might have a kitchen. We did and we went to Wal-Mart in Playa del Carmen. They also have a nice store on property for anything you need, even fresh fruit, whine, booze, clothes, personal items and much more. Good selections of everything. * Note that if you do not wish to walk to the main pool or beach, there are pools closer for just Grand Mayan members. Actually, we spend a day there and was very happy to be away as it was a bit quieter with swim up bars, great food and every imaginable lounge chair/bed you can think of. Lastly, the Grand Luxxe - which is the highest level of accommodations, is close to the main pool and beach, but separated from the main resort by a 100 yards or so just north of Mayan Palace buildings 1-5. Suites and Villas available. The food is FANTASTIC!! Never once had a bad meal and we dined at every restaurant except the Del Lago where they have the buffets and shows. Be aware, food and drinks are not cheap!! Two frozen drinks will run you about 200 pesos including tip. That's about $20 US. You do not need money while on the property. They will take a credit card number and give you a line of credit (which can be increased if you wish) and an electronic signature from you. You just sign your name for everything; they will compare the signature to the one you gave at the front desk. Note * for anyone not comfortable with vocalizing your room number (and you should not) just ask and you can write it instead. Also, tips are automatically added to the bills. The spa / gym (Brio) is very nice. I suggest a massage for sure! The beach is sandy, but if you plan on going into the water, bring surf shoes as there are many rocks!! Palapa's and covered chairs - There are many covered mattresses (Palapa's) along the property. The welcome book states they should be reserved and there is a $30 dollar charge (which goes toward food and drink bill), however, I think that is more enforced during peak travel times, as nobody did it while we were there. Just plop your stuff down and it's yours. No problem getting one early, but make it there by noon if you want the mattress Palapa's. Trips - Go to Playa del Carmen and walk the shops and enjoy the area. You can catch the ferry boat to Cozumel. Also, make sure to see the ruins. We took a combo tour which included a very nicely guided tour of Telum then a day at the water park. There are a lot of great things to do off the property. Really enjoyed it!!

Make sure that you avoid talking to anyone else at the airport. They are all time share sharks!!! We had arrived to the hotel about 1 pm, and check in wasn't until 5. We were offered an earlier check in, but it would have been in Building Number 8. We were slated to be in Building 1, so, we were more than happy to wait! Do what you can to be in the first 7 buildings! Buildings 1-7 are all centered around a lagoon, and are the closest to the pools, etc. Although there are shuttles that run, I just don't have the patience to worry about having to wait for one! My husband & I had made activity arrangements with outside agencies. The Grand Mayan doesn't allow outside tour groups onto their grounds, so we had to walk to the front gate to meet our vans. It is probably about a 15 min walk. So, even if you were in the furthest building, it would be no more than a 20 min walk to the beach. Not too bad. The hotel runs shuttles to PDC for $4 per person each way. We took this shuttle our first full day, mostly so that we could stock up on supplies at Walmart! You must do this!! We bought our beer, wine, soda, breakfast/lunch/snack foods. So much cheaper than the store at the hotel!! We paid 15 pesos for a 6 gallon container of water!! And, being that we do like to save money....we had packed a collapsable soft cooler, which we would fill with zip lock bags of ice and our favorite beverages. The cooler fit nicely into my beach bag, and no one ever said anything to us! Immediately after you check in, you are greeted by a time share representative...I think they call themselves tour guides? She tried to lure us in. The initial offer was the free breakfast and then 10% off your total bill at the end of the week. We weren't interested. Then she offered an extra $100. We told her we were already busy with tours. We were planning on renting a car towards the end of the week. Then she offered a free car rental. With all of this, I would have sacrificed the morning, but my husband said no. You had to go to the presentation within the first 48 hrs of check in. So, we received one phone call the next day, and then were never bothered again. But, what is strange, and I still don't know how it happened, I ended up in some other promotion and at check out had $300 taken off of our bill. Strange, but I will take it!!

The rooms look really good at first glance, but a lack of thoughtfulness was evident: we hardly had enough working outlets to charge our camera and phone, the room was more humid than outside (I think the AC had a problem.. the floor would remain wet all day), and the hot tub was leaky.

Lesson learned - ALWAYS put all of your valuables in the safe immediately! We were fortunate that none of our other valuables were taken by this person who rooted through our drawers to find the cash. The management tried every trick in the book to put all of the blame on us, until we found out that we had a faulty lock on our sliding glass door (first floor unit). The lock was in the lock position, but the door would still open. Even with that discovery, the resort would not take full accountability for this robbery, which we found to be unacceptable. They did give us a room credit for just over half of the amount stolen, but this was after spending 4 days negotiating this nightmare! They drove us to the police station in Playa Del Carmen, which is a place I NEVER want to be again, and a complete waste of our time. If you do decide to stay here, make sure the bell hop shows you where your safe is. Ours did not. We discovered one in the closet (studio side of the 2BR unit) that was too high for any of us women to reach, and we were not aware of one under the television in the 1BR side of the unit. The resort did not believe us that the bell hop did not show us, which is supposed to be part of their routine when they drop your bags off. After talking with several other guests around the pool, none of them were shown where their safes were either. To make matters worse, we believe this happened while we were at the time share presentation for more than 3 hours purchasing a vacation package! Now, I can't be all negative because if it weren't for this incident we would have had a wonderful vacation at this resort. The pools are great, especially the Mayan Sanctuary pool which re-opened the day we left. All of the food we had was good, and we didn't find it to be unreasonably priced given the portions. The drinks are expensive though, especially $4 for a small glass of iced tea at the poolside restaurant! My suggestion, if you want to drink a lot of bottled water, buy it at the \"Jade\" shop. It is half the price there as in the restaurants. The spa facilities were nice and we particularly enjoyed having breakfast on the patio of the health bar. Grounds are beautiful and well kept. All in all, I think this is a great place if you are on your guard and protecting your items. It is unfortunate that a top notch resort was not willing to take more accountability for the safety of their guests and our belongings.", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cPricey, but great experience\u201d", "Author": "fmboudet", "ReviewID": "UR109263255", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Grand Mayan for our honeymoon in April of 2011. My in-laws own a timeshare and were able to exchange their week for us. We read many reviews about how our building would be the farthest away from everything, but we were reasonably close--3 from the very back. We had never stayed in a resort before, and were very impressed with our room. It was spotless, had granite counter-tops, and nice sunken bathtub. We honestly didn't mind the walk to the pools and pick-up areas; it was usually about a 10 minute walk. We did three activities during our stay (Chichen Itza, XCaret, Xelha) and had a blast. During our days where we stayed on the property, we went to the happy hour from 11am-1pm and rented one of the 'palapas' on our second to last day. We felt it was worth the price since we planned on purchasing food/beverage from the pool-side area. Over-all we felt like it was an excellent deal. Our one complaint was just before we left. We had declined room cleaning service during the week to ensure our belongings would stay safe, but upon check-out, were charged a mandatory room cleaning fee. If we had known about the set fee, we probably would have let the maid come in once or twice, but that was the only big negative. Prices were a little high inside of the hotel, but nothing we were shocked by. Definitely a place to stay at least once if you are in Cancun, not if you have small kids. There is a lot of walking, and they tire easily.

Unfortunately, the best pool was closed. The Mayan Palace pool looks good in photos, but it is an oasis of asphalt - hot with little shade. Forget the beach because swimming is impossible due to the rocky shore line. The bar at the Grand Mayan pool was closed before 5:00pm! If we wanted a soda after swimming, it was a very very long walk to the nearest place. Before leaving, and after reading other reviews, we twice attempted to secure a room closest to the pools, but we were told the resort will not reserve rooms. We were in building three which was a good walk to the pools and farther to any restaurants. Any other buildings would have been horrible. Great rooms, but they are too far from any of the property amenities. The pool side restaurant wont allow swim wear or sleeveless shirts, so if you want to eat there, you have to take street clothes to the pool because there is no going back to the room unless you are in buildings 1-3! No coolers allowed at the pool so forget going to the market for drinks and bringing them with you. Excellent food at this resort! The wraps at Brio were delicious and enough to share. Typical resort prices. Limited choices for something quick. The market was fine, but limited in choices and slow service. All in all, we had a good time because we were semi-close, but it would have been very difficult had we been in other buildings because getting around is hard and rooms are very far away. They do have shuttles to deliver you to the pools, but who wants to wait for shuttles and haul all that you might need for a pool day in one trip? Would we go back? No. Expensive and too big. A few more hints: Don't go to the airport thinking you will buy snacks for the plane trip home! Unbelievably high prices. I bought a small sized Snickers candy bar for $4.50 cents! (Regular price at my grocery store: about 69 cents.) I would not recommend renting cars to drive to Playa or Cancun - take a hotel shuttle for safety and if you take a cab, agree on a price before getting in because there are no meters. Last, our doctor recommended a Hepatitis A vaccination before going, and at first I thought it was a little too pre-cautious, but we went to Xcaret and swam in the underground rivers (untreated water) and saw the way the woman at the Jade Market at the resort handled our food, and we ended up very grateful to have agreed to the shot.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Detroit, Michigan", "Title": "\u201cAvoid the sales presentation\u201d", "Author": "DinDetroit", "ReviewID": "UR107889836", "Content": "Other reviewers are pretty accurate in the resort description.

We had room service the first night and it was really great. Believe me when I tell you, I am a picky eater and tend towards high-end fair. I was very satisfied with our options. We loved that we could eat by the pool which isn't always the case at resorts. We enjoyed a good breakfast and dinner and grazed away poolside.

The beds are hard but we like hard beds so we were quite fine with that. The resort is lush and beautiful. We loved the jungle like quality about it. We prefered the sandy pool-quiet and family friendly, to the Mayan Palace Pool. We also enjoyed a wonderful massage, manicure and pedicure at the spa which I wish I had found sooner for I would have spent lots of money in this well equipt facility.

We didn't go to Mega Mart but hear it's even better than Wal-Mart--just farther away. We were able to keep our food cold by replenishing the ice and have our morning coffee in the room. Beware of keeping up with what you spend at the resort--it's cash free so you just sign your name when making a purchase then pay at the end of your stay--food and drinks are very pricey so you can run up a large bill without realizing it . We did eat twice at the Green Break which is at the golf course and is much cheaper--$15. for breakfast virsus $30 inside the resort.

We heard from another couple that they had bought then after reading and researching, realized they had made a mistake in the deal so they got on the computer at the resort and cancelled. you have to do it within 5 days so if you're there for a week, it's too late by the time you get back home to get out of it so check it over and make sure you know exactly what you're signing. Our ordeal did save us 10% off our total bill and 500 pesos ($50) off the bill. They also offered other special prices for excursions but we weren't interested and free breakfast. If you don't mind taking the time, it does save money. The grocery, deli, boutique are nice and the food in the grocery isn't too badly priced if you don't want to go to Wal-Mart.

The resort was large, beautifully landscaped and well maintained. Check in was a nightmare. We arrived about 11:30 am, there were long lines and the process was very slow. There were four of us with one couple being the RCI time share owner and myself and my husband. We had requested to be put in one of the closer buildings and to be near each other. After a long check in we were assigned rooms in two different buildings (3 & 6) which, of course were not ready. We were told to check back at 3 pm to see if we could get closer rooms. The person checking us seemed to be confused and couldn\u2019t really answer any questions and provided no information. We went to lunch, was approached by the time share representative who like everyone has previously mentioned offered us discount on tours, a tour of the resort and maps and the breakfast buffet. Not once did she say it was related to a time share presentation. So BEWARE of the approach. They called our room every morning at 8: 20 about attending, very hard sell. When we returned at 3 pm we were told one room was ready the other was not and that my sister was actually in building 12 and we were in building 6. Unacceptable, so we had to get back on another line and finally Emmanuelle assisted us and put us in building 5 & 6. It wasn\u2019t ideal but at least they were closer and shared the same elevator and shuttle stop. We finally checked in after 6pm. Whenever we ordered anything in restaurants or bars - we signed , no cash and all of our purchases were under the name of the RCI party but different rooms and different credit cards (600.00 hold when you check in initially). Be sure you check your receipts every time you sign. The rooms were wonderful, very spacious and clean. We were on the third floor and had a great view of the water and could see one of the many pools. We took the taxi to Wal-Mart the next day for 20.00 one way, the driver waited for us to shop and brought us back. We bought a bunch of stuff; the bell men load the bags in bins and bring them up to your room for you. Prices at the Wal-Mart were really good compared to the states, definitely buy alcohol and beer there and bring with you to the pools. Just bring a cooler in your beach bag and order one drink and your good to go. They will even bring you a bucket of ice. Drinks can be expensive especially after happy hour, which is from 11-1pm daily. We had two drinks and a glass of wine one night at Havana Moon it was 45.00. One bottle of wine in Wal-Mart was 8.00. Security- whenever you leave the resort by taxi they note the room number and taxi number and then note it again when you return. There were police check points on the road, which made traffic slow down. We even went to another resort for the day and the security system was the same, name and hotel and taxi number. Always many people walking on the grounds, staff always spoke, felt completely safe on and off the property. Pools- the pools were huge and very nice. Never really had to worry about finding a chair. On day Luis (waiter) reserved a cabana for us by the pool, when we arrived some people had put there shirts on the chairs. Luis told us to just move the stuff; we were there for 3 hours before the people even returned for their stuff. Crazy. There was a quieter pool area where mellow music was piped in, this would have been even better had it been adult only. Especially since there are so many pools, kids clubs and the pool with the sand. Nightlife was a little brief. The entertainment ended at 11:45-12 each night. The band at Havana Moon was really good, but again finished so early. We are big NCAA basketball fans and wanted to watch March Madness. The first night we were able to watch, the Sunday nothing, then later in the week the games were commentated in Spanish. Learned a few phrases. We were looking for a lobster dinner so we asked it they served it at Tramonto\u2019s, they didn\u2019t have it the day we inquired but promised to get it for us the next night. It was very, very good and reasonably priced. The staff was wonderful. Luis and Jorge at the main pool were outstanding. They always remembered what we were having and made sure we were happy. The housekeeping staff was good as well. We tipped accordingly as services were rendered. FYI- at the end of your stay the day and evening housekeepers leave an envelope for you to provide tips. Checkout- You must be out of the room by 10:00 or you get charged another day. Check out again was a little confusing. Seems the wrong credit card was associated with each of our rooms. We thought we had this cleared up, signed our receipt and checkout out. Four days later we get a charge for our room and our other parties room. The also charged the other party as well. Getting this cleared up was a major hassle, multiple emails, multiple telephone conversations with different people. Very, very disappointing. Still waiting for the credit. All and all it was a great stay, the resort is beautiful, the rooms very nice and the staff was great, however this whole double billing and the confusion at check in has left us with bad feelings and would not likely to return.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Winnipeg, Canada", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort if you can get past the time share presentation.\u201d", "Author": "NatashaAndBoris51", "ReviewID": "UR102528484", "Content": "The resort is beautifully landscaped with a 18 hole exectutive golf couse.

This resort is HUGE and spread out. My 14 year old daughter, her best friend, her mom and myself made it a \"girls vacation\" and it was fabulous. Check in was a breeze. Be prepared to have a credit card with $600USD put on hold for your room as it is a no cash resort. We were supposed to have cell phone service (Verizon), but no service was available. Purchased a calling card for $15 USD at check in for unlimited use for 7 days to call home. Worth it. The location of the resort is far from downtown Playa and the Cancun airport. About 35 minutes from the airport and 35-40 minutes to downtown Playa for shopping and restaurants. Be prepared to spend $20 USD one way for a taxi to downtown Playa. Not negotiable. They all charge the same. Check out the timetable for the shuttle to downtown - only 40 pesos ($4USD), but the last one coming back to the resort is at 9:00p and they don't run that frequently. Planning is needed (which we didn't do very well). The seating is for 11 or 12 and they won't let you have anyone seated on laps. Room We were in Building 3, 1st floor. I have some difficulty getting around, so called ahead for a building close to the pool and reiterated it upon checking in. If you are in any other building besides 1, 2 or 3, be prepared to walk. Our room was immaculate. The day and night maids outdid themselves in keeping our room spotless even with having 2 teenage girls living in a 1 bedroom for a week! Tipped them well for their service. Dipping pool was a bit chilly since we were on the ground floor and the sun didn't get to the patio. Certainly didn't detract from the overall satisfaction of the room. Full kitchen stocked with dishes, utensils, cookware. Bed had firm mattress. Heard our neighbors baby crying one night, but only that one time. Had an end unit so neighbors only on one side. Pool AMAZING!! We sat at a different pool every day and never had trouble finding a chair. Of course you get the usual inconsiderate people who find it necessary to save a chair by putting a towel on it, but we just moved their towel after 1 hour...wasn't a real issue. The palpalas were comfy but never reserved one. We waited until the end of the day (about 3p) and then helped ourselves when people left. There are a total of 3 swim-up bars. Two in the Mayan Palace pool and one at the Grand Mayan pool. They ring the bell at 11:00a to signal happy hour and when they do....look out...people swarm to it. The bartenders are terrific and have good memories if you're a regular day after day. If you have underage teens like we did, just be sure to tell the bartenders the drinks should be virgin....the drinks were very generous with alcohol. The pool boys are always around cleaning and maintaing all the pools. Make sure to participate in the water aerobics....great fun at both pools. Food The breakfast buffet at Del Lago is extensive and good. Had a sandwich when we arrrived mid-afternoon at Greenbreak. Good panini sandwich. Pizza from Balache was terrific. Cooked in a brick oven. Not too badly priced. Dinner at Havana Moon was ok. Don't understand some of the other comments about how wonderful it is. Prices weren't that cheap. The selection wasn't that great. Live music at 8p for all ages. Dinner at Frida's was great. Note: Looked all over the map they give you when you check in, trying to find this restaurant. Finally called....the same restaurant that's called Balache during the day, changes the name and the menu to Frida's at night. Might want to make that more clear on the pull out map. If you're willing to go off the resort property and want phenomenal food, check out these restaurants in downtown Playa on 5th Avenue: Carboncitos Las Mananitas Casa Mediterranea - best italian. Look for Hotel Marieta...the restaurant is hidden a bit. Don't ask the locals...they pointed us in the wrong direction. Keeping looking....it's well worth it. Timeshare presentation I'm an RCI owner. Didn't bother me too much since hubby wasn't with. They did try and persuade me to attend the breakfast/presentation, but for only 10% off the bill....not enough to get me to waste 4-6 hours of my vaca. Don't believe them when they say only 45 minutes.....liars...hard sell no matter how many times and ways you say NO!

I wanted a 10 day vacation and I wanted at least a few nights close to the action. It worked out perfectly. I went to check in on Sunday around 2pm. I had requested a room closer to the pool but if it's a busy week they give owners priority. After begging I was able to get a room in the closest part of the Jungle..Building 8. The first day was a disaster. It took 30 minutes to check in and then I had to wait for a shuttle to get to the room. I finally got to the pool and when I went to get a towel there were none left so I had to wait. I ordered food at the pool and after an hour of waiting I grabbed a waiter who retook my order since it obviously was never placed and I got my food right away. I agreed to go on the timeshare presentation because of the freebees..Just be prepared..it takes 3hrs..not 90 minutes but I felt it was worth it. I explained to the salesperson that I didn't like the resort because of all the issues I had on the first day. I also notified the concierge. Let me tell you..after the first nightmarish day the vacation improved 100%. Once I got acquainted with the grounds I fell in love. The pools are magnificent. The grounds are exceptional and the resort is immaculate. Once I figured out directions I was able to get to the pool by foot in 7 minutes. The fastest way to the lobby is to take the route the shuttle takes instead of the paths alongside the buildings. I did enjoy walking the longer way since i got to see the crocodiles and flamingos. Happy hour is great..double size yummy drinks. Food was decent. Loved the Italian restaurant. In an effort to make things up to me because of my disastrous first day, the concierge sent up a plate of chocolate covered strawberrys. How nice is that! The remote control wasn't working so I called the front desk. They sent one immediately and called to follow up. I felt very safe in the resort especially once I knew my way around..that took a day. The security is tight so If you are not staying in the resort there is no shot you are getting in. The spa was amazing..great massage..helped my sciatica. Do the snorkel tour to Isle de las Mujeres..so nice! Saw a school of Barracuda swim right in front of me. My only suggestions..there should be some heated Jacuzzis by the pool to hang in at night. Also there should be later shuttles into town since downtown Playa is so fun but you need to get there later. The latest shuttle is at 6pm so you have to rush from the pool to shower and get ready and the clubs don't get started til 11pm.

My wife and i were here for our March Break the week of 12th to 19th. Rental Car- I had rented a car online before we left from EZ Car Rental which is located maybe 10min free shuttle away from airport towards playa. The cost of the rental is cheaper online as well as the insurance. You have to get third party liability when you pickup the car which is mandatory. So we were fully covered for anything. AIRPORT- As you are exiting the airport you will pass on both sides of you people dressed in white and it says information. They are timeshare people. Just ignore them because they will say anything to nab you. Once outside keep straight if you are getting the shuttle. Turn immediately to your left if you are getting a rental. HOTEL- Easy 20min drive from airport. Signs on hwy. for hotel are marked well in advance. Take note exit for puerto morelos. Great public beach and snorkeling on reef literally 5min. drive from hotel. I pulled the car right up in the turn around for Grand Mayan lobby. We checked in and a guy came out loaded all our luggage in a van, then i followed him over to the car park. We then carried on to The Jungle bldg. #8. If you have to be in the jungle you dont want to be any farther then this bldg. It is a 10min. walk to everything from here. We were hit or miss with shuttles. If one was going by we jumped on. If not we walked which we didnt mind. We were on the 3rd floor facing west, so sunsets every night. Also looking at construction. The otherside gets morning sun and faces the golf course. But our plunge pool did warm up to a usable level with the afternoon sun. The room is well equiped to cook your own meals. I brought my xm radio so we had good tunes in room. I was able to hook laptop into flat screen in bedroom for movies we brought. The grounds and pools are awesome. Always able to find an area to ourselves. Only the beds by the main pool do you have to book and rent. The ones back by lobby pool are free. We had one everyday. We were never bothered by timeshare people. The staff was always friendly, and went out of their way to make our stay great. RESTAURANTS- Havana Moon pizza is great(cheap) and so is the live music there. Two nights we danced up a storm. The other places we never ate at. We had some chilean wine at the wine bar one night. The prices are crazy. You will go broke eating and drinking here. I spent 16.00 on 2 rums and 27.00 on 2 glasses of wine. just to give you an example. We had roomservice 2 nights which is more reasonable. 40 bucks for chicken dinners and 70 bucks for steak. But we drank our own wine. BIG TIP- coolers and your own food are not allowed at pools or the beach. We brought a cooler hidden in a beach bag. They sell cans of corona at the resort poolside. So guess what i bought at the super walmart in playa.(where we got all our groceries and wine). I would load the cooler with beer,wine,rum, and mix up pina coladas(blender inroom) and sandwiches. I just got a couple of their plastic cups and poured all but the beer into them. We saved a fortune. Nobody would have to do this if they were reasonable with their prices. BEACH- the beach is fine for laying out looking at the ocean,but you just cant jump up and go for a swim. If you walk to your right for 5mins you can swim and snorkel. If you go left it is a 10min walk but better beach and less crowded. Playa Del Carmen- brought my garmin gps with mex maps not perfect but very helpful. Easy to find super walmart and mega. Would go to walmart over mega shopped both. 5th ave was fun and beach is nice. Sams club is right off hwy easy to find. If taking car watch your parking, dont even have a tire over a line. Big moneymaking scam for tickets. TULUUM- if you have a chance go to the beach in tuluum (the town not the ruins) Turn at the next road past the ruins and follow it all the way to the ocean. We stopped for lunch at a hotel called BE TULUUM. They let us stay and use their beach for the day.This beach reminded us of Anguilla. OVERALL- Great hotel very upscale. Not a hotel if your physically impaired because of all the walking. Beach does suck. Very pricey for food and drinks. Nice not having all the loud drunks everywhere as you would at an all inclusive. No free internet. Great gym.

The resort is very nice. We enjoyed the facilities and had good experiences with the staff. Our room was in the \"jungle\" section of the resort. Others complain about the distance to the main parts of the resort but we had no issues walking from our room to any other part of the resort. It always took less than 10 minutes to get anywhere. We never used the available shuttles. I was there with my family including 3 daughters ranging from 16 to 22 years old. We never felt unsafe on the resort and were comfortable letting my daughters walk around the resort without us at any time of the day or night. When we first arrived to check in, they had us booked for a room that was much closer but it wasn't ready yet. They said we could get into a room immediately if we were willing to be in the further section. That was OK with us and we really didn't mind the walk at all. The room was very nice. We had a 2 bedroom condo which was basically a one bedroom condo with a connecting second bedroom and bath. The room was more like a beach resort condo than a luxury hotel room but it was still very nice. The beds were definitely firm but we generally like firm so this was perfect for us. All of the furniture was in very good condition, not worn or old. We used the kitchen for breakfasts mostly. The refrigerator was a regular sized unit (not mini) and the stove was 4 burners, which we used. The bathrooms were very clean with a shower, dual sinks and a toilet room in the main part of the bathrooms. Each also had a jacuzzi tub. And the main room had an additional sink outside of the bathroom. There was a balcony (we were on the second floor) with a small \"dipping\" pool which we didn't really use. It was nice to have but the water was fairly cool. Our balcony overlooked the golf course, so it was a pleasant view. The resort has a lot of swimming pools one of which is very large. The pools are well kept and there a plenty of chairs to set up for the day if that is what you want. They also have cabanas by the pools that you can rent for the day and your rental price will be deducted from your food and bar bill. There is a nice sany beach, but the edge of the water is just rocks, so it isn't really a place to swim or play in the water. It is beautiful to look out onto the deep blue-green Carribean Sea and the sand is soft and white. So if you don't want to go in the water (just want to sunbath and enjoy the sights) it is a good beach. There is a gym facility that is fairly nice. We used it only once while we were there (there is a fee). There are several restaurants on site (and the resort is very isolated so you have to travel quite far to get to other restaurants). We ate at 5 or 6 of the restaurants. Tramonto was an upscale Italian place. It was very good but somewhat expensive. Gong was an upscale Asia restaurant (mixed Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Indonesian). It was also very good and fairly expensive. We had a good meal at the golf course restaurant. Can't remember the name. But it was Tacos and fajitas only at night. Good price and good food. Certainly the best value meal we had there. We went to the large buffet breakfast at Del Lago twice. The offering is very extensive and much of the food was decent. One thing that many people complained about here was the timeshare sales pitches. We avoided that completely by telling them that we weren't interested and that we already had activities scheduled and paid for for each day we were there (which was true). Since that is one of their main selling points on getting you to sit thorugh the sales pitch (they offer you free breakfast and dicout activities), they didn't bother us at all about skipping the sales pitch. By letting them know that we had activities scheduled each day, they knew we could spend the time to listen to the sales pitch and go through all their sales levels. I am pretty sure this made our stay much more enjoyable than other people who had to put up with the relentless sales tactics. Anyway, overall we thought this was a very nice resort.

Admittedly is very confusing at first but good way to meet other lost people! Somebody else mentioned the exchange rate. We didn't change any money. Used dollars everywhere (off the resort. On the resort is all charged to your room). Got pesos in return change. Only regret is wish we could have gone snorkeling off the beach but the red \"No Swimming\" flag was up the whole week. Had a fantastic snorkeling excursion though. Also, as has been mentioned, the pools are amazing. We listed to the time share presentation and pitch to get the discounts. The end of the pitch is very interesting. If you turn them down for \"financial\" reasons they come up with some amazing deals relative to the first price one is offered. The Grand Mayan is very clear with their instructions on how to find their transportation van which was very helpful as you really have to focus on getting through the truly mindboggling number of time share people who are waiting to nab you. The salesman did tell us the Mexican government is outlawing this practice effective this year sometime. If you want a less crowded excursion to some Mayan ruins and you've already done Chichen itza take the Ek Balam trip. It was truly beautiful and there were only about three other groups there.

The pool at the Grand Myan is very nice much more laid back atmosphere. They have a nice spa and fitness center.

The food was excellent. The resort is to an extent uncomfortably large and requires a great deal of walking even with the relatively efficient shuttle service. It does offer good opportunities for jogging along with an 18 hole golf course on the grounds (so you have some perspective of the size of the place). Too many of the services are centralised with the buildings of the \"Jungle\" stranded out on their own. We stayed in a hotel room with no refridgerator nor microwave and loved that we were given the opportunity to laze around with a pure disinterest in household duties. It was wonderful with a two person jacuzzi in the bathroom (mind the marble floor throughout the suite though as it gets very, very slippery when wet), a daily maid service and a turn down bed service at night. The walls are very thin and we could hear the couple next door. Even so, we weren't unduly disturbed though we were careful when discussing sensitive issues. The entire resort is meticulous and general areas such as the pool and lobbies are literally continuously (though discreetly) cleaned. There were reports that the food was expensive but generally the entire area of Riviera Maya is expensive, Playa del Carmen (is a bit cheaper throughout not so much on Avenue 5 though; but do visit for the architecture and the beach) and there wasn't a huge difference in the prices there. The souvenir boutique Jade at the resort is reasonably priced too compared to the surrounding shops and the jewelry shop Deseo has a wonderful staff, Marvin and Luis, who really do offer some nice Mexican art pieces. The resort too is far off from anywhere and you will need to use the shuttle or rent a car. We did the latter because we wanted the freedom, but it's really according to how much you want to move around. Note though that there isn't much parking over in the \"jungle\" area either and you may have to park in the central parking area and catch the shuttle if you are there - very inconvenient at night. There were many repeat couples at the retreat who just stayed in for a week or two and never left. The pools are also fantastic but you must book the wonderful little covered beds (paletas???) by 7.30am for 35US/day. If you buy this much from the pool restaurant the beds are free. There are 3 general pool areas and they are so huge that they are never over crowded. It is a wonderful place and the excellent service make it a joy and we would surely return. It would be nice though if a larger amount of night life - such as a small party at the pool say or at one of the restaurants - were available. There is no place for adults to enjoy a good dance and drink after about 10.30pm and the place shuts down around11pm-midnight. The architecture honours Mexico's history and the resort is very well decorated. The tour prices at the hotel are very competitive and worth it much more so than striking out on your own unless you like the adventure. There is a 10% discount with the timeshare presentation but a couple we met were kept six(!!!!!) hours. We didn't bother to go and received maybe 2 calls over 7 days asking if we would like to come over (if you have the patience the 25US breakfast at Delago that is offered is worth it!). Summarising, the worst thing was the size of the place but not enough of a deterrent to keep us from returning to a fab resort with such excellent (!!!!!) service. Chicen Itza is a must see. There is a very good onsite gym, spa and internet cafe. Wifi is available from your room too but it is a bit expensive.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego", "Title": "\u201cAmazing place....not for handicapped.\"\u201d", "Author": "cat4u", "ReviewID": "UR99957660", "Content": "Take the shuttle to Mega grocery store and fill up on food as the restaurants are pricey, but very good.

I read about 100 reviews ahead of time and learned a lot. Be sure to email the concierge to reserve transportation from the airport. concierge.cun@grandmayan.com.mx Do not stop to talk to anyone inside the airport at all. Just head right outside, cross the road to the little island where all the shuttles are waiting and there is a podium for the GM people to register. We had about a 10-15 min. wait to get a shuttle. I also called a couple of weeks earlier (011-52-984-206-4000) and requested a room in buildings 1-5. I said I had had back surgery and my husband knee surgery recently and wanted to be closer to things. They said they would note that in our file. Well of course when we arrived they were going to put us in the jungle #12 because 1-5 was only for \"owners\". I said I had called a couple weeks ago and she asked what they said. I said they took note and would take care of us when we arrived. Well after a little conversation, we ended up in Bldg. #1. They said they didn't have any rooms with a kitchenette available in #1 but would do the side with the king bed, couch, TV.... Plus they would give us a discount on the room to make up for no kitchen. The 2 of us really didn't need all that anyway so we took their deal of $200 off our room and were able to get a refrige and microwave delivered to the room. Plus they gave us the red \"owner\" bracelets that gave us access to everything. There was a lady wanting to meet us for the \"complimentary breakfast and tour of the facilities\" We knew it would lead to the timeshare deal so we declined and explained we had read all the bad reviews. She tried to tell us that all those people had been replaced 2 months earlier but I was reading reviews up until the night before we left, not 2 months earlier. She apologized but still called each day to invite us and offered 10% off our final food/drink bill. We just let the phone ring and listened to her messages but never returned the calls. Yes the bed was very firm but we never woke up with any aches. Food was a bit high but well worth it. Service around the pool was awesome. I don't know how they remember everyone's drinks! The strawberry margarita's were soooo good! We did take a shuttle into Playa del Carmen and walked part of 5th Ave but was not impressed. Went to WalMart for snacks and a couple gallons of water. Bring a spanish dictionary if you need to ask the workers to find something at WalMart. We looked for insulated glasses but couldn't find any big enough to hold the double margaritas at the pool. Bring your own- that's what the more experienced \"owners\" do. Ended up with sore feet but that made the pool even more inviting when we returned. I think the gift shop/deli/grocery at the Mayan has just about anything you need and when you figure in how much you pay for a shuttle to PDC you probably come out the same. If you get a chance, go to Xcaret. The park is so beautiful, the underground river is refreshing, swim with the dolphins, great food and a wonderful 1-1/2 hour show at 6:00pm of dances and music from ancient times to present. I'm a music teacher so I especially enjoyed this part. Well worth the money and a nice break from sitting around the pool everyday. Nice beach area too. You can book this trip in the hotel lobby. We had done Tulum, Xel-Ha and Xcaret about 20 years ago and I remembered how nice it was at Xcaret. They have made so many improvements there! We had a great waiter and asked for him each night at Del Lago- Sebastian aka Pancho. We talked to him quite a bit and gave him $5 tip each night- he even brought ME a gift one night. Arrive around 7:00pm and ask for a table near the stage so you get a good view of the show. The dancers/acrobats and their costumes are amazing. A dif. show each night. Our last night we went to the Tramonto Rest. I had the lobster special and my husband had the steak- excellente!!! We probably won't return as we like to try different places but we had a wonderful week at the Grand Mayan and would recommend it to anyone- esp. the awesome pools!!! We have many beautiful memories and photos to remember this trip.

As many previously I've read almost every review, so I decided to write one up myself. To sum it up the place was amazing. It exceeded our expectations. I'm going to try to provide as much detail and suggestions as possible below. 1. Read all of the reviews, the good, and the bad. I recommend keeping a word doc handy copying/pasting good pieces of information into a document you can later print out and keep with you. This will keep you from saying, boy I remember I read something about..blank. I then challenge you to keep an open mind when you arrive and draw your own conclusions. 2. I would call 3-5 days before check-in to verify reservations, schedule a free shuttle to pick you up from the Cancun airport, and request a close building. Knowing you'll need to pay for transportation to get back to the airport you have a few choices. You can arrange it through the resort, but it's $15 a person. If you have any more than 2 people I would arrange a shuttle (We used \"Cancun Shuttle\" to take us back at departure). They showed up on-time in a suburban all to ourselves. It cost $40 to take all 4 of us back to the airport...worry free. 3. As for all of the talk on getting a building close to the pools there are many factors that come into play here. Are you staying in the \"Mayan Palace\" or \"The Grand Mayan\"? Even at that not every building has every room type. For example we stayed in \"The Grand Mayan\" in the biggest room they had (sleeps 8), but the closest building with this layout was building 8/9. So it's going to depend on which resort, and the type of layout on the buildings you can pick from. 4. The timeshare sharks....not, more like gold fish. When you first arrive and walk into the main lobby you'll get greeted with someone holding a clipboard, and then directed to the front desk to check-in. After check-in that same clipboard holding person will approach you again, hand you a map, and ask if you're interested in \"learning more about the resort\". We told them no, they then asked if we had the week planned out if we needed tickets for anything, we once again told them no. That was the end of it. No pressure, no mean looks, heck we even went back and talked to the lady 30 mins later with no additional pressure. Because of our arrival time (10:30 am), and the fact the room wouldn't be ready until 4:30pm they gave us a 20% off coupon to eat lunch on campus. We did so and enjoyed happy hour (11-1) while we waited. 5. The room. It had a full kitchen (minus oven), 2 separate bedrooms each with whirlpool tubs, king beds, couches, and decks. On one of the decks was small jump pool that was a tad cold, but would be great during the hot season. The kitchen had all of the needed pots/pans, bowls, silverware, blender, toaster, microwave, fridge, cook top, and coffee pot. Ice was right down the hall (3rd floor). The fridge held plenty of food and drinks (see picture below). We put 40+ beers in there, 2 bottles of rum, milk, juice, water, yada yada. I can't give any complaints on the room it's self. Nothing was ever stolen, or even messed with. We had 2 safes in the room we put some valuables in. I placed certain items in positions that I would know if someone messed with our personal items, but NOTHING was ever touched. Call me brave, but I drank the resort tap water all week with no problems....They have a filtration house on site which must have done the trick. There we also complaints about the bed being hard....yes it's a tad firm, but by the time we were ready for bed (either blasted tired from a long day, or intoxicated) the bed felt like heaven and I didn't know the difference until 8 am when I was awoken by the singing birds. 6. The campus (grounds). We were located in building 9 (The Grand Mayan). Building 8-13 are called \"The Jungle\". Yes, it's a 10 minute walk or so to the main pool area, but something we did 2-3 times a day with no problems. There is a shuttle (extended electric golf carts) that swing by every 10 mins or so, but we only road those when taking our luggage to the room the first time, and leaving. If you are capable of walking...do so. Stop by and say hi to the crocs, or the flamingos. You're certain to see an iguana or some other random creature. Plus, as every other review has stated, the landscaping is breath taking. The crew (1800+) keep the place perfect. They are always out doing maintenance whether it's sweeping, painting, pruning, or planting. 7. The beach. The sand is nice, they sift it daily for foreign objects. The shoreline is rocky. I read a review before I went to buy some Crocs. I've never owned a pair in my life. I purchased a pair and wore them non stop everywhere. Best investment prior to the trip. If you want some traditional beach time it's only a few mins away. Go down to the beach, turn left and walk a good 15 minutes. You'll pass 2 life guard stands (not counting the one right outside the resort). Our flags went from \"red\" to \"yellow\". No rocks at all...we went out a good 50-75 yards with the water only coming up to chest level. Sure this beach is in-front of another resort, but all beaches are public in Mexico, just don't try to use the other resorts chairs. 8. Off campus. I would suggest taking a few trips down town to Playa to buy groceries and shop. We went down the second day to stock up on food/drinks at Wal-Mart. Once again the resort has pre-arranged shuttles to take you down there ($4 a person each way), or you can walk up to the road (cross it to be with traffic heading to Playa) and flag down a Colectivo (Van). It was only $8 for 4 of us to ride to downtown. Get a downtown Play map before you head out so you can navigate it easier. It's easier to pay for a cab back though after grocery shopping so you have the whole car to yourself along with the trunk for the food. That will cost you $20 from the Wal-Mart back to the resort. They'll drop you off at the main lobby where the golf-cart shuttle can take you back to the building. Further more we did a day trip to Xel-Ha, and then over to Cozumel to snorkel. Both trips turned out perfect, but I'll spare you from those details on here. 9. Food on campus...There are 6 or so places to eat at the resort. They all have a dress code (besides pool side places), but that only consists of shoes, shirt, shorts/pants, no swim attire. Pretty much nothing more than you'll need at Mc'Ds here in the states. The food is a tad pricey, but not crazy. If you don't eat at Del Lago (the main open air dining buffet) then you can get a meal for $15 or so. Every night Del Lago has a different dinner menu and show. On average it will cost $30 a person (not including drinks), but couple that with a live show and it's worth it. On Thursday night they have a \"Mexican festival\" that costs $60 a person, but the show is extended, open bar, and they do a few extras to make it fun. Del Lago doesn't honor happy hour. Happy happy is actually double the size of your normal drink. You can also get the drink of the day all day for double the size. As mentioned above we bought drinks at Wal-Mart and hauled them down to the pool in a collapsible cooler we brought from home. There are signs up saying no coolers, but we never got questioned, just don't bring some monster styrofoam one. Heck we even blended our own drinks and poured them into the massive water bottle you'll have it room...once again no questions asked. During that trip to Wal-Mart we also bought breakfast and lunch items to cut costs. We had pancakes, eggs, toast, fajitas, spaghetti, and deli sandwiches all from the room! 10. Pools...tons and huge. Not a bad pool on campus. More of an older crowd at \"The Grand Mayan\", and those are restricted to guests of that resort wearing the wristbands. We played water volleyball, did the aerobic thing, and the bartender water game all at the main big pool. We also brought a water Frisbee which gave us a few hours of fun. 11. The Staff....all super friendly and nice. Take with you $25-$50 in ones, or acquire some pesos for tips. It's crazy what a tip will get you even down town Playa. They'll point you to the better restaurants, and the insider tips. We also left a buck or so for the maids who were in your room twice a day. If you don't want them in there just put out the \"leave me alone card\". We did for a few days as there was no reason to change the sheets and have fresh towels if we've only used them once! Save the environment! Hopefully you find this helpful....I would for sure recommend the place, and if i ever get a chance I would go back!", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cA grand time\u201d", "Author": "charity0212", "ReviewID": "UR99600913", "Content": "I read quite a few reviews on the Grand Mayan Resort and most were good and that is what I found staying here. This resort is huge and kind of confusing. There a few \"resorts\" on this resort, Mayan, The Grand Mayan, and The Grand Mayan- The Jungle. I stayed at the Grand Mayan- The Jungle which were 1 or 2 bedroom suites. The room was awesome! We had a full kitchen with a fridge, stovetop (no oven), microwave,blender,coffeemaker..this also includes pots/pans,glassess, and utensils. The patio was large and had a jump pool that was too cold to go into. What I could tell by the difference of these areas from what I saw and talked with other guests is that the Mayan rooms were not as nice and some did not have a microwave or fridge. Also there is a pool just for the Grand Mayan and Grand Luxxe (not still sure what Luxxe guests mean) which is private, quite, and beautiful. If you can get to the area Grand Mayan (not jungle) Buildings 1-8 it is closer to the pools and lobby. There are shuttles (golfcarts) that come every 15mins to each building to take you to the lobby or pool. Wished they can more often because there were alot of peoplen waiting often for a shuttle. We did walk one day and it took about 10mins. But I know if you stay in the Mayan part those walks were much longer. The beach was sandy but the walk into the ocean was too rocky to go in the water and it was not that nice to look at. BUT the pools are ridiculous...! They were warm and refreshing, clean, and huge. The pool bars were great to swim up too and waiters were good. There is 2 for 1 (which makes the drink double in size) drinks from 11-1 which are a good deal and the drinks were good quality. There is a daily special drink that is always double for that specific day. Few other things you may want/need to know: closest town in Playa del Carmen which is a flat rate of $20 one way. The hotel has a shuttle from the airport to the resort for free, you just need to email the them to give them your flight information. To get a ride back it is $15 per person and need to make a reservation at least the day prior with the concerige desk. If you are staying there longer than a week they change your room key code on your card, so you need to go to the front desk to reprogram (pain because they do not tell you ahead of time and you get to your room and then need to shuttle back to renew). There is a small grocery store on the resort with some good things but little more expensive than at the Mega in Playa. There is a deli with sandwiches, coffee bar, sweets, and a crepe (which were great) at this store too. Everything is charged to your room including the resturants- no cash. We did not get approached by the timeshare people as I had read most of the reviews. Not sure why, but did see alot of people being approached. I would recommend anyone to stay at the Grand Mayan. We had a great experience and I hope my comments give you some insite to this resort and how it works.

You will read some negatives about the property. Yes, the beach is bad. Yes, the property is huge. Yes, you will need to walk. Yes, sometimes there is a wait at the restaurants. Yes, the deli/grocery store is expensive. Here are the positives -- and there are many: 1. The grounds are GORGEOUS. Green grass, trees, iguanas, and flowers everywhere. Absolutely beautiful. We stayed in building 7 at the Grand Mayan and had a five minute walk to the pool at the Mayan Palace. We loved the walk! it was quick and so pretty. If you have mobility issues, the walk could be a problem. But, there are shuttles and the shuttle drivers are delightful. Trust me -- we did the walk several times a day with a a six year old, two year old, and one year old. It was no big deal. I understand that some of the buildings are much farther away and you have to take the shuttle. I can't comment on that but I'm sure it does detract from the vacation. 2. The staff is AMAZING. Flat out amazing. Friendly, kind, helpful. Housekeeping staff are incredible. Whenever you call for anything (for example, to have laundry picked up), they call back after a little while to make sure you got what you needed. These people are attentive, warm, and welcoming. Great, great staff. They found my daughter's lovey and got it back to us. Excellent people! 3. It's CLEAN. I don't mean kind of clean, I mean CLEAN. You will see maintenance and cleaning staff everywhere. Fingerprint on a glass door? Whoosh, it's gone! Leaf on the walkway? Whoosh, it's swept up! Drops of water on the bridge across the pool? Whoosh, wiped up! I'm a clean freak and let me tell you, this place is gorgeous. 4. The store/deli. Yes, it's a little expensive, but I'd rather get what I need there and not spend half a day making a trip to Wal Mart. It's super convenient and you can get yummy sandwiches, fruit salads, pastries, lattes, etc. 5. The gym and spa. WOW. Great spin, yoga, and pilates classes. Lots of equipment, sunny and bright with huge windows. Can't beat an awesome spin class with Mauricio while looking out at palm trees and the ocean! And afterwards, a swiss shower, sauna, steam room, sauna....ahh, heaven! Need a pedicure? Need a haircut? Bikini wax? Massage? Done. 6. The pools are awesome - so fun!! Happy hour from 11am-1pm. Great kids activities, too. As far as the time share presentations, just politely say \"no, gracias\" and they'll leave you alone! No problem! No one bugged us at all. I could go on and on, but I'll end by saying we absolutely loved staying here and can't wait to go back!

We weren't interested in being downtown on the strip with the noise and craziness of the neighboring bars and hotels. We were looking for a relaxing resort to enjoy the company of each other and we found it at the GM. A couple of suggestions: Timeshare Presentation - If your firm about it from the moment you check in, you'll never be bothered again about the time share presentation. We almost had to be rude to get through to them, but after that 30 second interaction, we were never bothered about it again our entire 7 day stay. Location - Located about 30 minutes from the airport and downtown Cancun. We weren't interested in being on the downtown strip. We were interested in being in a luxurious vacation spot and feeling like we weren't in a hectic area surrounded by bars and out of control patrons. We rented a car, this way we could drive and go where WE wanted. We drove to Puerto Morelos, Playa del Carmen, Chichen Itza, Akumal, downtown Cancun and never had any problems. Beach - Yes, the beach is NOT swimmable, but with the car this wasn't a problem. We would get in the car and leave for the entire day and go to the beach along with other sight seeing. While I love how the ocean sounds and looks, I'm not a big ocean swimmer. I can do without the salt water and how it makes my skin feel after I get out. So a couple of days and a couple of hours at the beach were enough for us. Pools/Grounds - This place is immaculate and seems to go on and on and on. The pools were too warm, but then we were there during the hottest part of the year and it's hard to cool a 5 foot pool that sitting in the sun all day. The multiple pools were very impressive, they twisted and turned in multiple directions and were vast and HUGE! The resort was extremely clean. They were constantly tending to the grass/trees/flowers, etc. Yes, this resort is huge, but people, your on vacation, take a walk to the pool for goodness sake! We were put in building 12, which is in the \"jungle\" section of the resort and just about as far away from the registration building as you can get. But, a 15 minute walk never hurt anyone, plus we weren't in a hurry, so we didn't mind walking. We never waited more than 10 minutes for the trolley. There was a clock outside the building that gave you a rough idea of when the shuttle would be by. Again, not a big deal to us. Food/$ - Our first stop after we checked in was at the Costco in downtown Cancun and the Mega Mart. We bought breakfast and lunch food and spent about $90 total. We purchased, a case of Kirkland bottled water, chips, lunch meat, bread, mustard, cookies, watermelon, milk, cereal, juice, beer, etc. We ate breakfast in our room everyday and made lunch to take with us in the car while we went out to sight see. My innovative husband took the hotel garbage can and filled it with ice and then we put our lunch in the plastic \"laundry\" bag provided by the resort and kept in in the car with a beach towel wrapped around the garbage can. It would stay cold for the entire day. And this way we always had safe drinking water with us along with lunch and plenty of snacks. One day we ate lunch in Akumal at an authentic outdoor taco bar (AWESOME and CHEAP!) and one day we ate poolside in the Palupa. Overall, we loved the GM. We truly felt like we were very lucky to have chosen this resort based on pictures and reviews from the internet. We didn't choose this resort based on friends/families opinions, it was just a decision we made with a little bit of research and some common sense. You have to decide what is important to you. Is it important to be on the strip where all the craziness is, or do you want to be in a quieter location that truly feels like your away from the hustle and bustle. If you want to be able to bar hop, then this isn't the location for you. But if you don't mind getting in your car and exploring your options, then you'll enjoy this location.

The first time, we were in building 7, close to the Cafe del Lago and the pool and beach. This time we were in building 9, which is about a 10 minute walk farther from the pool and beach. We took the shuttles when we could catch them. We also walked quite a lot, and it's a workout in itself. There should be more and larger capacity shuttles in the busy times of the day, as competition is sometimes fierce, and more than a few people had no concept of waiting their turn to get on. The grounds were beautiful as they are in all the Mayan locations. Work had just started in the \"Jungle\" behind building 8 for the Grand Bliss, and work was continuing on the other side of the resort on the Grand Luxxe. Neither of these affected the middle of this huge resort. If possible get buildings 1-7 when checking in. If you get building 7, ask for a suite facing inward, as the outward facing suites look into the yards and homes of an adjoining older community of homes. The Sanctuary, a GM pool area was just opened when we were here three years ago. However, now it is fully planted and decorated and is beautiful. Bring small shackers of salt, pepper, sugar, etc, as they are not provided, but they do supply a roll of paper towels, and ample supplies of hand soaps, shower soap, shampoo and lotions. In your luggage (not carry ons), bring a sharp cutting knife. The one large knife provided is very dull, and I have noticed this with all the Mayan resorts we have been to. We enjoyed the Cafe del Lago, Havana Moon, Taco Break and Frida's for dinners. They add a 15% tip to the bill. All taxes are included with the prices on the menu. The staff members were uniformly excellent even though their tip was guaranteed. Their Brio hot tube (pool size) and upstairs gym facilities are both excellent, but only lightly used.

I read reviews saying this was a big resort, but until I got there, I had no ideal how big the grounds truly are. Pros and cons: The pools are magnificant and vast. You can sit at a different pool everyday for a week. Some pools are more kid friendly than others, such as the sand pool. On the flip side, the beach is terrible if you like to play in the surf or swim in the ocean. The beach is filled with rock and coral, but you can't even snorkel, at least when I was there due to access and current. There is a swim beach about 15 minutess walk to the north. I hear they are working on permmits to add an artificial reef out in the deeper waters so they can fill the inner beach with sand and make it more appealing. The grounds are immaculate and nicely landscaped. The rooms are nice and I believe most are equiped with a plunge pool. Just be aware the plunge pool is a cold plunge intended to cool you down during the heat of the day. This is not a hot tub to sit around in during the cool evenings. There are many types of restaurants with different taste and quality. The japaneese was my favorite. Our first day we arrived pretty late and my son had not eaten for a long time, so we tried a bunch of restaurants and we were not prepared for a wait at each at least 35 - 45 minutes. We wound up getting food for him at the local deli within the grounds. The whole scene was pretty ugly beacuse of several factor. We had a tired kid and the grounds are so big, it took us 15 minutes of walking to find the first restaurant, and then we had to keep walking to all of the others. Granted, I did travel during one of the businest vacation weeks of the year, so crowds were at there peak. With a little planning, we didnt have that problem again. We found room service to be excellent and reasonable. The gym is great, with everthing you need, including free waits, nautilas equipment and classes. I think I paid $24 for a 5 day pass and used it every day, although they never asked me to check in. I'm not suggesting you do anything unethical, like not pay, but person after person walked right up the stairs to work out and never went to the front desk, so I doubt anyone is checking if you paid at the gym. Very important note about the buildings. There is a cluster of buildings called the Jungle. The Jungle is located the farthest from everything and isn't surrounded by quite the beauty of the rest of the resort. There are no pools anywhere near the Jungle and it is at least a 15 minute walk to the nearest pool. If I were to go back, I would not even consider being put up in the jungle again. The only posistive thng is at the end of the week, I actually felt great from all of the walking. You can wait around for shuttles, but thats not my style. The beds and pillos are terrible hard mattresses and lumpy pillos are not for me. perfect if you dont mind a hard mattress. In summary, if youwant to hang pool side all day and dont mind big crowds and like a resort that has everything confined within the grounds, this can be your dream resort. Nicest pools I have ever been in and I travel often. There is a good 18 hole golf coarse. Spa, and there is also plenty of entertainment for adults and kids alike. For me, I personally wouldn't go back, as I like a smaller resorty. I spent some time off the reorts diving and finding nice swim beaches and good restaurants. Renting a car is cheap and worth it.

You know that before you come, but there are some nice swimming beaches just 1/2 hour walk to the north or south. Puerto Morelos was the place for us to visit. Great divng with Wet Set. A professional and frienly dive outfit. Be wary of the snorkel tour taxis at the pier. Some lack insurance, some have had...you get the picture. Taxi operators from the Mayan were very good, clean and friendly. There are a couple of taxis that are \"Certified\". There is a large yellow sunvisor on their windshields.

Because of its location and layout, guests' movement and activities are controlled rather well. It's located between Cancun and Playa del Carmen, which means you either shop on the grounds or take a shuttle or taxi elsewhere. Because the beach and pools are so far from the Jungle, you either walk quite a bit or wait for a shuttle to take you across the grounds. The resort is extremely well maintained with comfortable, attractive rooms and gorgeous, albeit far away, pool areas. Thanks to the reviews of others we avoided the timeshare presentation so did not have to contend with that. Arrival was problematic since our names were not on list for airport shuttle even though they had our names at the resort. Had to bribe the guy at the airport to call the resort to verify that we could ride. Security was great. My wallet was stolen during the tour to Chichen Itza and Valladolid (watch your purses--they ran up almost 5K before the cards were canceled), and they came to our room that night when I called and talked me through the phone process and told me to go to the police in Playa, which I did the following day. The concierge was less accommodating and concerned and offered no assistance. All in all, this is a lovely place but we do not plan to return because of its location. The pool areas are great, and there are abundant lounges on the beach. Prices in the deli and boutique aren't out of line, but we did shop at the Mega in Playa to get breakfast and lunch things. If we did return, we'd probably rent a car to avoid all the taxis we had to take. It took three taxi rides to take care of the trip to the police stations in Playa. You report the crime at the Touristica Policia and then have to take that report and the fee to the main police station. Quite an adventure, but one I'd prefer to avoid. I think it would be an ideal place for someone who merely wants to unwind in a lovely setting and stays on the property.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canada", "Title": "\u201cbeautiful structures, non-swimmable beach, noisy pool area\u201d", "Author": "ccvvbb", "ReviewID": "UR97151823", "Content": "We spent a week at the Grand Mayan. The guest rooms are big, beautifully designed and comfortable. The suite's TV had good access to CNN in English as we followed the uprising in Egypt. The kitchen was equipped with microwave, toaster, fridge and basic plates, pots, glassware and utensils. A small grocery store on-site sells a wide range of food items. The property and pools were kept very clean; you can exchange a pool towel for a crisp dry one during the day. The pool water is warm. Lots of pool-side lounge chairs are available to guests - but the four-poster beds required reservations and extra payment. We took the half-hour bicycle tour around the place - the bikes are not adjustable for tall people, and the guide was not very interested in keeping his troupe together. He took us to the two different crocodile enclosures and the flamingo garden (the birds were inside however). The restaurants were good, with typical US pricing - don't expect bargains here. We used the fitness facility (make sure you have running shoes or they won't let you use the machines) and followed up with a nice visit to the spa below - where I couldn't quite get the Swiss shower (multi-head up and down along the walls) to work. The beach is rocky - don't even try to go in without water shoes or some other protective covering for your feet. If you fall you could get a nasty scrape on the sharp rocks. No one was swimming there; a few courageous types did some snorkelling, but it wasn't very good. The afternoon beach volleyball game (anyone can play) starts at 4 pm and was lots of fun. Both large pool areas host some sort of loud competition or aerobics class every day in the early afternoon. That bothered me the most - it was impossible to get away from the amplified music and announcements unless you go down to the beach in front of a restaurant that blocks the sound; the natural music of the waves is so much more welcome. The trip into Playa del Carmen costs $40, and was well worth it.

I also injoyed the Spa especially the salt water soak. For a treat we went to the wine bar and ejoyed a great bottle of Mexican Nebbiolo. The bad was it rained a bit while we were ther. OK that happens but the sidewalk were very slippery many people had slips and falls. The cement should not be so smooth. Also because of the smooth tile on the floor in the hall way it was like a skating rink. Ugly was the upsale that I endured. My finances are quite tight and I was panicked during the hard sell I received as they convinced me to convert my time share to their residents week program. I think I have a better program but my trust is gone so I guess I will see . If you are a timeshare owner with the Grand Mayan be sure you know your contract and bring a copy with you. They told me they sent out packets explaining the new program with a time limit to convert. I got no packet and several others I met at the pool were surprised when they got there as well. That is the first hard sell... anyway I was there for 5 hours getting it all straight. What a drag! The last of the ugly was that we were on the first floor while our parents were on the 3rd floor.

We found the service excellent, the rooms GM average but having the usual very poor kitchens and kitchen equipment. Why they give a microwave oven but no microwaveable dishes is beyond us. The master room is not equipped at all and we have had better in a $50/night motel in the US. By fighting hard we did manage to extract a small fridge and a coffee maker out of them itherwise you need a cheap cooler from Walmart if you want to keep milk. The gardens are beautiful but the walkways are very poorly lit at night and it is very easy to get lost en route to a restaurant.. While the beach is immaculate, we were horrified to find that the sand simply stops at the water's edge and it is then nothing but very sharp shelly limestone rock and coral underfoot. This makes ocean swimming virtually impossible and we do not travel 5000kms to swim in a pool, however big it might be. The sand is very soft and hard to walk on and it is difficult to walk a mile to the nearest hotel which has a good swimming beach. There is, of course, excellent ocean swimming in Playa del Carmen but that is only accessible via the infrequent (every 2 hours) shuttle to the edge of Playa plus a 15 min walk from there and at a cost of $4 per person each way. Grand Mayan should provide a complimentary shuttle to the nearest available swimming beach at least every half hour which id what other resorts have done when they lose their sand in a hurricane. GM seems to have done nothing in the 5 years since they lost their beach. They should also be looking into building an artificial reef to protect the shoreline and retain the sand. This has been done very effectively at Lidgate Beach in Kapaa on the island of Kauai, so it is not beyond the whit of man. The grocery store on the property is outrageously expensive but there is no alternative except Walmart or Mega in Playa which can only be reached with difficulty and at considerable expense. Other reorts in the Cancun area (The Royal resorts) have a policy that their on site groceries are the same price as downtown. GM should do the same. The location of the GM is awful. 25 km to the airport to the north and 25 km to Playa to the south with absolutely nothing in between along the 4 lane highway. We know that there are frequent buses between Cancun and Playa but the GM does not provide a shuttle to the main gate to get them and don't even have a bus schedule available. One feels one is a prisoner in a gilded cage the whole time one is there.

GRAND! It is very upscale, gorgeous property, friendly staff, clean rooms, nice activities such as yoga on the beach, water exercise, childrens activities etc. BUT; for a middle class family from the USA, it did not meet our expectations for value. To eat at any of the restaurants was VERY expensive. $11 for a hamburger, $12 for a salad and $3 for a bottle of water is crazy! You could not find an ala carte restaurant for a nice breakfast (had to pay $19 for a buffet (which we cannot eat alot of food), so had to take a shuttle or long walk to the Green Cafe which was a long way from the lobby/pool area. Drinks were good but again expensive; had to wait for happy hour 2 for 1. The transportation: if you have mobility problems this is not the place for you. Shuttles came around frequently but had to wait. If you are a RCI trader they put you in the farthest buildings (no negotiating) and to walk to the pool was about a mile or a half hour walk. To leave property it cost $20 each way ($40 round trip) to go to Playa Del Carmen to go to Walmart for cheaper food, drinks etc. but it will cost you $40 to do so. The beach was terrible. Hard to walk being it is very uneven and rocky. Could not walk to nearby resorts on lovely beaches because you were blocked by big cement jut-outs in the ocean that you would have to walk around and could prove to be dangerous on the rocks. Pool area; gorgeous with about 10-12 inter-connecting pools and some felt like bath water. When we traded 7 years ago all chairs and palapas over outside beds were free; first come first serve.

We walked one day and it was a very long walk ( I have a bad knee so we did not repeat the walk). They used older vans with poor seats and difficult for those of us with a slight handicap to get in and out of. Now to the good stuff. This hotel was huge and the resort is as clean as anyplace I have ever stayed. There was cleaning staff everywhere. The restrooms near the pool were monitored all the time and the floors were kept clean and dry. Our rooms were spotless. The staff was extremely helpful although they did not all speak much English. The beach is not a swimming beach but it has a beautiful sand area with many chairs. The huts by the pool can be reserved a day ahead so find where you want to be and book one they are great. They charge you $30 but if you spend $30 in food and drink at the pool they write it off. Be sure to double check your bill because this does not always happen. They tell us that it should happen at check out. Restaurants had great food. My husband and I most often split something for lunch because the portions were generous. The food and drink are not cheap so plan to spend some money at the resort. Drinks were upwards of $10. Happy hour is 2 for one from 11-1 so we were sure to get that bucket of beer or drink before it ended. The pools are great and very clean. No hot tubs but we did not miss them. Always a place to sit because the area is so large that you do not even really notice how many people at the resort. It nevers felt crowded. Like most of the reviews we had a splash pool but we never used it. When people above us used theirs we had a water fall but it was over the splash pool so it did not bother us.

However, the resort is so big that you need to walk 20 minutes in some cases just to get to the hotel lobby or pool, or wait for a shuttle that comes by every 20 minutes. This isn't the kind of place where you can just run down to the lobby to purchase a newspaper. Furthermore we had to pay for gym and spa access, which I found unacceptable. Gym and jacuzzis should be included with your hotel fees (& the women's jacuzzi's jets were pathetically weak). This is mostly a timeshare resort and a very elegant one, but be prepared to pay high prices for everything. It's hard to get off the grounds if you don't take a private taxi or shuttle.

It's 30 minutes from Playa Del Carmen and 30 minutes from Cancun.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boca Raton, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNice Resort-but would not go back\u201d", "Author": "bgleen80", "ReviewID": "UR94253000", "Content": "Just returned form the Grand Mayan and while the resort was nice, I would not go back for two main reasons: 1) If you are not a direct owner, you will be relegated to the \"Jungle\" a group of apts twenty minutes away by foot or a ten minute shuttle ride. This is extrremely inconvenient, because the resort did not have the foresight to intsall a satelitte pool for this group of buildings, so you have to give yourself a half an hour to wait for the shuttle and the ride before you got anywhere. 2) No swimmable beach-while the poolls are immense-as the previous review read, there are \"acres\" of pools, I did find the ability to swim in the ocean quite bothersome on a vacation Some other points: with all the vast acres of pools available; the architect left out some very important spaces-there are no hottubs or spas on the property; the only one is in the main spa for which there is an extra charge. Also, while there are vast pools, there is no water feature like a waterfall that would certainly be welcome. There are many pluses here: 1) The apts are quite nice with two bedrooms, two large baths, a LR dining area, and kitchen-this came in handy for breakfasts 2) I found the food to be above average, and sometimes quite good (although a $75 charge for lobster in their Asian restaurant is absurd.) The $28 dinner buffets were, in my opinion an excellent value.3) while in general, the staff's English was very poor so it was difficult to get any answers from the staff, when there were some ermergencies (flat tire, accident claim), these were handled very efficienetly The $20 cab ride into town can be shared by as many as four people so it was the same as the hotel's shuttyle; this did not bother us.

We found it very easy to get around by the large golf-cart style shuttles - they were very frequent and very efficient. Just gliding along on the shuttle was fun! Even though we were in a building far from the pool (#18), it was easy to get to the action by walking to the Lobby and then taking a shuttle. We also were able to catch the shuttle at our building, but there was sometimes a wait. The walkways are beautiful. Aside from the pools, there wasn't really much to do for our two 18-yr-ish kids at the resort itself without investing in some of the scuba or other day trips. Interesting to watch our teens handle their withdrawal from cell phones, which will incur a huge roaming fee as messages ping in if you turn them on even just to set an alarm (check your plan in advance to see what the international charges will be). Definitely a resort for the family to bond without distractions! Our big activity was hitting the pool and aerobics at noon with Pepe, truly fun! Maybe we just looked busy but we were only approached once once about attending a time share presentation. Just say no! We also didn't have a problem in Playa del Carmen with people approaching us, a firm quick 'no thanks' did the job. We did hear that those who went to the presentation were stuck there much longer than 90 minutes. Also important: call your credit card company to tell them you're traveling to Mexico before you leave from home! Most places only take Visa/ Mastercard/ AMX, not Discover. Cash was no problem, there was no fee to exchange money in the Lobby of this resort, and we were able to pay off our bill in remaining pesos. The portions at the Havana Moon restaurant on site were huge - I would recommend eating there early in your stay and bringing the leftovers to your room for a second full meal! Also, we got room service for a meal rather than eating out - we split two meals instead of 4 full meals and saved money this way. Shopped at Mega grocery store in Playa del Carmen early in the week to take food back to our room - having breakfast and lunch on our own was easier than eating out every meal. Mega is a sight to behold! The offerings at the resort's grocery/deli were very limited. We discovered the Greenbreak restaurant at the resort for breakfast late in our stay, it was beautiful to sit and eat overlooking the golf course, wish we had eaten more meals there. I have to say, for the first two days, I wasn't sure if this was going to be a great vacation because there wasn't much to do other than hit the pool.

Food at the resort is out ragous, when we got there we stopped by the pool side eatery and ordered 2 beer, 1 soda, a 6\" pizza and a 12\" pizza and the total was about $50.00. We did not hear anything good about the food unless you like hamburgers. Breakfast was a buffet at $24.00 U.S. each!!! The store on grounds is also very expencive. We had a rental car for the week and shopped for food at both Walmart and Mega in Playa. Mega had a better salection and and prices. Beach if you want to sit in the sand under the sun then great. If you want to play in the surf forget it. We walked up the beach both ways and did not find a good spot for our 10 year old to play in the surf. My nephew and I did walk out and snorkle on a calm day and the man made reef holds a lot of fish. (You need water shoes to walk out in front of the resort!!!!) We drove down to TULUM to see the ruins which also have an on grounds beach that you can use. We spent a day there and loved it.

The next morning I went to thet front desk with her and they had her fill out a form and acted all concerned. They told us that they would move us after they looked into it and they would move us closer to the pool because of our inconveionce of having to move. That was that last we heard about it. We did not get moved. Activities??? I am sure there were a lot going on, but how you find out about them we never did figure out. Kitchen we had a 4 burner stove, big fridge, big microwave and everything else we needed except an oven. I am guessing some units most have had ovens because the store sold large pizzas.

I do not travel to Mexico to spend more money on drinks and food than I do here in the US, especially for \"less than par\" food at that. I also do not travel to Mexico to not leave a resort. I travel to Mexico to swim at the beach, enjoy the nightlife, for the wonderful authentic Mexican food, cheap drinks, oh and of course for the great deals on silver. If this sounds like you, this resort is NOT for you. This was my first time staying at a \"4star\" resort in Mexico and I can tell you it made me long for my \"2star\" hotels that I normally visit. The restaurants, not to mention the gift /grocery shop, were outrageously overpriced and food was nothing to write home about. The mexican food was hardly likeable, I thought I was in Mexico. You are in the middle of no where. If you want to go to downtown Playa Del Carmen it is a $20 cab ride and takes about 25 minutes. The beds are rock hard, and I am not exagerrating, I mean rock hard. Out of all my travels to different parts of Mexico which previously stated is usually the lower end but nice, clean, safe hotels, I have never experienced sleeping on concrete, well I have now. Beach? There is no beach. If you want breakfast in the morning there is only one restaurant that serves breakfast, the Havana Moon, which is a buffet and it costs $24 per person. If you(man or woman) are going to hang out at the pool all day and don't have a shirt to put on, forget about having a snack or drink at the \"pool bar\" because a shirt is required. If you like to pay $10 for a pina colada this is your place. I do not like to feel \"stuck\" with absolutely nothing in walking distance. Honestly the only thing positive from this resort compared to my normally visited lower-end hotels were the massive pools. But not sure why someone needs 10 miles of pool? There is happy hour from 11am to 1pm, although it takes quite some time to receive your drinks. Be prepared to say your room number anytime you order anything, and everytime you leave or enter the hotel. They do run a $600 hold on your credit card at the beginning of the stay. They say \"no cash policy\" but that is not true, we paid cash for drinks, ice cream and room service but you have to tell them you want to pay cash. Room service is your best cheapest bet for breakfast. Yes you can go to the local supermarket but personally I don't go on vacation to buy groceries and cook, but if you are going to stay at this place and don't want to run your savings into the ground that's your only option.

Our room at the Grand Mayan was large and comfortable with a well-equipped kitchen. The staff is very polite. The restaurants and bars are on the low end price-wise for a large resort, though not cheap. The food was surprisingly delicious. There is a beach, though it's not for swimming. Good thing that the pool area is beautiful. BUT Though the website shows you fun in the sun, our building was a twenty minute walk from any of the amenities and the shuttle carts were not really to be relied on. We heard the traffic from 307 rather than the waves of the Caribbean. When we tried to switch rooms, we were told there was nothing closer. As we kept on trying, we found that all the rooms in Buildings #1&2, the two closest to the beach and pool are all smoking rooms. (Doesn't make sense that the best location would be entirely smoking, but I checked out some of the rooms and they all reeked.) As we went further away, the buildings got closer and closer to an enormous generator- constant low to mid-level hum. So, having seen six different rooms, we determined that unless you were a smoker or didn't mind the smell, or hard of hearing or up for two hearty constitutionals per day, you were not going to get the room you wanted. When I asked the manager of the reception to make the situation better for us, suggesting that he waive the $80 per week for wireless internet, he responded that without a problem with the room, he could offer no compensation. Now, it's not the end of the world- the positive things I mentioned still made for a nice vacation experience. BUT the place claims to be a five star resort and my notion of that is that if anything isn't totally perfect, they need to make it so. The resort is enormous and it doesn't seem like the designers gave a lot of thought to the layout. The management seemed content to let a customer go home dissatisfied. I would choose someplace else. If you do go, try and find out where your room is before you make the reservation.

In summary, we enjoyed it, my parents loved it. I'm glad we came, but probably wouldn't come back. I would recommend it for those on a budget though. Shuttle - the hotel arranged for us to be picked up at the airport and brought to the hotel at no charge. This went very smoothly - waited 5 minutes for the shuttle to fill up and then went straight to the hotel. Rooms - we were in building #2, which we felt very fortunate for because it was so close to the lobby, pools, restaurants, etc. I think my vacation would have been very different if we had to wait for a shuttle all the time to get around. The rooms were huge - living room, dining room table, kitchen with breakfast bar, separate sink for living areas, 2 closets, jacuzzi tub, double sinks. Although we didn't use anything except the refrigerator, it was nice to have a fully equipped kitchen. The decor was more 2-3 star quality, kind of mexican cheesy. The plunge pool on the deck was way too cold, so we didn't use it. Restaurants - Havana Moon has burgers, pizzas, etc. It was just ok - was about $20 pp for app and dinner. I really enjoyed the food at Frida's - it was the best meal that I had while at GM (about $30 pp for app, dinner, drink). Room service was on time, food was ok (about same as HM). We got breakfast sandwiches ($7) and coffee at the deli almost every day, which were great. Everyone has different food tastes, but I wouldn't recommend this hotel for their food. Granted, we didn't eat at Tramonto or Gong though. The grocery store is a little expensive, but it's nice to have the convenience. Pools - the pools and grounds were beautiful - exceeded my expectations. I loved the small, sanctuary pool and the large Mayan Palace pool. Definitely my favorite part about this hotel. The pools were cold, so I didn't go in them much, but they were nice to sit around. We never had a problem getting a chair - might have been because the hotel wasn't full. My only complaint is that there were no hot tubs! Gym - used it twice - we didn't have to pay and the facilities were very nice. Rental car - we rented a car twice from the onsite agency - once to go to Tulum and the Tulum beaches and another time to go to dinner in Cancun and then Akumal the next day. Process was seamless and we didn't have any issues. Finding our way was very easy and the roads are in great condition. There was also free parking very close to our building. Golf - it's pretty expensive - $75, which includes greens fees, cart and clubs. It's just a par 3, but there are a lot of hazards on the course. We enjoyed it. Internet - there was wireless access in the rooms, but you have to pay by the hour, day or week (you pick either option). It was $170 pesos (about $15 USD) for one day. Service - in general, we never had any issues with the front desk, room service, pool service, restaurants, etc. They even fixed our showerhead without being asked. They also fixed the noisy fan in my parents' room without being asked. I was annoyed that the concierge told us that there was only one ferry to Cozumel - they must get kickbacks because there have been two ferry companies for over 10 years (so I found out). Another concierge was helpful though with fixing some dinner reservations. Location - GM is located about 45-60 minutes from Cancun, 15-20 minutes to PDC and 1 hour from Tulum. If you want to spend a lot of time in either of those towns, you'd probably want to stay in a hotel that is closer. We ventured out a couple of times, but next time would prefer to stay closer to PDC. All in all, the GM was fine for our trip with my parents.

We were in \"The Jungle\" in the last building - #13. We were a group of 6, My husband and I, 2 adult daughters, son in law and 21 month old grandchild. The unit was very large and clean, the pools were amazing. We arrived one day late on a Monday, December 27th and were in our room very quickly. A crib and our luggage was delivered within 15 minutes. The only real negative thing I have to say about the room is there are 9 pillows on each bed (and we had 3 beds). The sleeping pillows were so large they just couldn't be used and with all our luggage and people in the unit, where were we to put all these pillows when we wanted to sleep? The maid staff was excellent - none spoke any English at all. They did fawn over our grand daughter and chased her down the hall several evenings with \"babe! babe!\" and bring her a chocolate. It was cute and she learned \"Ola\" and \"Gracias\" very quickly! Upon arriving, we purchased a few things from the on-site store and spent 1000 pesos. Just to give you an idea, a 6 pack of beer was 180 pesos. We purchased several 18 packs for the week at Walmart the next day for 170 pesos. As a matter of fact, we loaded up at Walmart for 2100 pesos and that included breakfasts and lunches for the week, milk, beer, rum, diapers, juices, snacks, 10 gallons of drinking water, coffee, etc. We did not go hungry. We ate all our evening meals in the Restaurants on site. The negative of being in Bldg #13 was we had the farthest to walk to the pools and lobby which wouldn't have been a big deal except for the 21 month old. The positive is it was REALLY close to the main road and the city bus (Playa Xpress & Collectivo) ran by quite frequently. We had a Spanish speaker in the group, so we made use of the bus going to Playa del Carmen, Tulum, and Puerta Moralez. Resort Transportation: was good at times, non-existent at others. It was good between 11-4 and after 7 or 8pm. The other times, many of the trams were being used transporting luggage and people just coming in or leaving the resort. The pools were wonderful - but not heated. Our grand daughter had a blast in them. We reserved a bed for a couple of days and had the $30 deducted from our bill at the end of the week since we spent over $30 on food an alcohol at the pool those days. Happy hour was between 11-1 and we made sure to stock up before 1. However, some days service was great, others it was terrible. One day we waited almost an hour and a half to order a bucket of beer and lunch to our bed. Restaurants: We ate mostly @ Tacos (on the golf course), and Fridas (next to the pool). The last evening we split up and some went to the Italian Restaurant and others went to the Asian Restaurant. Both were very good. Tips were automatically added to the bill. I can appreciate this as sometimes it's hard to figure when you are dealing with pesos. However, I believe sometimes service suffered because the tip was automatic. I'm on the fence about this. I usually tip 20% and the automatic tip was 15%, so I saved money but felt the service would be better if the tip was truly a gratuity. Timeshare Tour - We did not take this although they called the room several times. We unplugged the phone. We rode in from the airport with a family that took the tour last February and said they were there for 9 hours!!!!!!!!! No Way was I giving up a day of vacation. Checkout: Each building had a check out desk on the weekend which made it very convenient. We had two credit cards on file and that was messed up with our charges on our daughters card but it was an easy fix. You do have to check your bill and save all your receipts to make sure you don't get someone elses charges. There were people in line that had this problem. We called for 2 taxis and they were there in 15 minutes. I loved this resort, but prefer an all-inclusive in Mexico. It was too stressful watching our food/alcohol expenditures for a group of 5 adults and one child. We did stay at an all-inclusive our 2nd week and it was completely stress free and relaxing.

With the amount of money we spent on upgrade to Grand Luxxe, we expect all ocean view rooms. The Conceige was great. There are coffee, pastries available 24 hours. The maid service is ok, need more training. The Grand Luxxe Shuttle are running frequently. There is a pool area only for Grand Luxxe member which has partial roof. We spent most of our time there. There is onsite conceige, will help you make restaurant reservation, tour info etc. Everyday around 11am, they will provide fruit Popsicles, my kids loved that. Overall, we had good time.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, WA", "Title": "\u201cTwo Thumbs Up\u201d", "Author": "Axelant", "ReviewID": "UR89380550", "Content": "We stayed at the Mayan Palace about five years ago but T-Day week 2010 was our first stay at the Grand Mayan. Originally booked for the Palace through RCI, we had purchased the trip insurance which allowed us to make a last-minute change for a 2-bedroom suite at the Grand, although we only needed a single w/a kitchen (not available). We had called a few days before and asked for a garden view in buildings 1-7, but when we checked in, we were told that none was available. Our first unit was in building 8 overlooking an ugly construction-like lagoon and the access road in front of the buildings. We were able to trade for a quiet, private, garden-like view off the back side of building 9 although the deck got more sun. There was no way they were going to give us buildings 1-7 even though people were checking out of those. There is quite a walk from buildings 8-13 but it isn\u2019t awful, and the paved paths to the pools meander along beautiful landscaping. As others have reported, you can get places faster walking than waiting for the shuttle. We\u2019ve timeshared a lot of places in Mexico and Hawaii, and these grounds are the most stunning. The abundant pools sparkle like aqua blue diamonds. We are not sun worshipers and particularly appreciated the Grand Mayan pool situated in the shade with gorgeous landscaping. As you will read, the pools for both the Mayan complexes are fabulous \u2013 the best we\u2019ve seen. They are very kid friendly. The beach is also kid friendly as far as lots of sand to play in and the shore is studded with low rocks \u2013 there\u2019s lots of beach further down that isn\u2019t so rocky. It is quite large with many palms to provide shade. Room amenities \u2013 As mentioned, we had a 2-bedroom unit with two masters (one would normally be a lock-off with no kitchen or fridge \u2013 it is fine if you plan to eat all meals out as in a hotel). We slept in the primary one with a dipping pool outside on the deck \u2013 a nice amenity. A big plus for us was the comfortable bed. Mexican beds are typically rock hard. But this king-size bed had a nice pad on the (still firm) mattress and the pillows were good. The bathroom had two sinks, large shower, separate toilet w/door and large soaking tub. The lock-off had a Jacuzzi and that was the one thing we used in the room as our master just had a soaking tub. Overall, the d\u00e9cor is the most modern we have encountered with lime green accent walls and Picasso-like paintings on the walls. The huge covered deck had two very comfortable chairs and two lounges. Two minor negatives were the small refrigerator and no dishwasher. Maid service was great, although we typically put out the \u201cdo not disturb\u201d card for the bed turn down service. Timeshare sales \u2013 We have participated in many. They will try to get you at the car rental (we rented from Avis for $200/week). Just be warned that when they hand you off at the rental counter to the people providing you with directions, they will try to hook you into a timeshare presentation. It\u2019s the same routine we caved into five years ago when saving $150 on the car rental sounded like a really good idea. If you want to spend up to two days of stress and anxiety sacrificing your vacation for $150 off on car rental, go for it. We got suckered into a fiasco took months to straighten out with our credit card company. So not this trip did we go through that. No to the car rental person. No to the person in the lobby. We were nice but firm that we had everything planned and bought all our tickets on the internet. We were left completely alone after that. Pool \u2013 No matter what time we went, we always found a good spot in the shade. Happy hour is from 11-1 and drinks are about $7 for two. They are a bit on the weak side so we embellished them from our own bottle of tequila which we bought at Mega in Playa del Carmen on our first night when we stocked up on groceries. We didn\u2019t end up eating at any of the restaurants on the resort as we fix our own \u2013 unless we were out on a day trip. Groceries \u2013 Although we did much of our shopping the first night at Mega (we avoided WalMart per the negative reviews on Trip Advisor), the nicer grocery store (in a large mall) is Soriana (where we made many other stops \u2013 easy access) on the far end of Playa del Carmen right off Hwy 307 (easily seen). FYI, the people/boys who bag your groceries work for tips. Try to give them a peso or so. We did not tip the guys in the parking lot who put sun shields on our windshield. The water at the resort is safe but we took another writer\u2019s suggestion and filled a pitcher with ice, let it melt, and drank that \u2013 it seemed to taste better. There really is no need to buy bottled water and you\u2019ll save the environment another plastic throwaway bottle. (They don\u2019t seem to recycle at the resort .) Money \u2013 The Mayan Grand/Palace complex is all cash free. When you check in, they put a hold of $600 on your credit card. I\u2019m glad we were warned on this website about that so we felt comfortable with it. Cash free is a great way to go. We charged everything to our room and all was well and fair. The system works. For all meals and tours in the area, we charged our credit card and thus, needed very little cash. When we felt the need to have some, we paid for a small item at Soriana with $20 and got pesos in return. Our credit card charges a lot for a cash advance so we brought dollars with us. Please remember that it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the locals to get pesos for American change. Tip with \u201cbills\u201d or pesos \u2013 not change. Xel Ha \u2013 We decided to go as one of us is a water rat and it sounded like there was good snorkeling with lots of fish. First, don\u2019t go for the fish. Yeah, there\u2019s some on the far side of the lagoon near the rocks. Otherwise, the center of the lagoon is mostly sand and grass, which doesn\u2019t attract fish. It is a great place for families and kids over age 5. The river float \u2013 do it first thing and ride the so-called \u201ctrain\u201d - which is actually a bus \u2013 to the stop. You really can safely put all your stuff in a bag and expect to pick it up at the end. Do not try to take non waterproof camera gear with you. I also advise that every adult be in a single tube. We took a double and it was a nightmare. There is nothing worthwhile to snorkel and see along the way but fins are helpful to propel you down the so-called \u201criver,\u201d which is a branch-covered stream. Once you break out into the open, the river has several scenic and fun activities particularly appealing to teens and young adults who want to leap off a cliff, walk a tightrope across the water, or take a sling ride. The paths (with the Zen-like name of Path of Consciousness) in the park are lovely to walk and we enjoyed them. And the food! Mama mia! We were there for both breakfast and late lunch and the food buffet was fabulous! We got our free tequilas at one spot and begged at another spot for more tequila in them \u2013 it worked. (Beer is serve yourself \u2013 all you want.) There are rows and rows of chairs to plop in and relax, as well as remote, picturesque palapas. Many of these will end up in the hot, bright sun, but the views will be lovely. We had pictures taken along the way and bought one w/a toucan. The botanical garden and bee area are definitely no big deal. (We went to Xcaret five years ago and enjoyed it as well. We loved the dinner show. Food was good; show was spectacular.) Playa de Akumal \u2013 We took a day trip here for snorkeling and sandy beaching. It is, indeed, a lovely place and very kid friendly. Drive all the way into Akumal under the arch toward the beach. At a fork in the road, swing left. There will be a parking lot across from the Dive Shop. We discovered this after parking all day for free at another dive shop right on the beach. (They said it was ok!) It also wasn\u2019t real crowded on the day we went. Both areas have someone on site patrolling the cars so we felt very safe leaving ours. We walked down the beach and found a nice shady spot under a palm tree (there are several) and suited up for snorkeling. We discovered there really isn\u2019t any reef here, thus, the fish are few and far between. We saw no turtles but did spot a couple of little stingray. I guess I\u2019m a snorkeling snob after going to Hawaii where the water is clear and the fish are plentiful. Nevertheless, there are a ton of people out snorkeling in the large shallow bay. We had lunch at a great casual place (one w/tables but not the dinner place \u2013 you\u2019ll know when you see it). There were also very clean bathrooms nearby this restaurant for use by everyone. Playa de Xpu Ha \u2013 This place was hard to find! We finally asked a fellow at the Barcelo employee parking lot after driving up and down the area a couple of times. So here goes\u2026Heading south on 307, about a kilometer after the Barcelo, you\u2019ll see a Pemex gas station on your right. Take the next retorno (return) and head north. Watch for a hand-painted blue/green \u201cscenery\u201d sign (about 6\u2019 wide, I\u2019m guessing) that advertises a beach and rentals/rooms. This is a gravel road w/a gate (that is probably permanently open). There\u2019s a sign that says the road owners appreciate a $2 peso fee to keep the road up. I have no idea where one pays or if it\u2019s a scam. We just kept on going and dodged potholes along the way until we got to the end. I think you can park just about anywhere but the safest bet is right by the restaurant. Oh, and don\u2019t pick the coconuts (there\u2019s a warning sign about this)! The beach itself is beautiful and a bit more rustic than Akumal. It is clean and kid friendly. There\u2019s a restaurant that is most likely great. Although we only stopped to check it out at sunset, it looks like the kind of place where you can sit under a palapa as long as you let them bring you drinks and food. It won\u2019t be quite as developed as Akumal (which is fairly low key) so pick whichever atmosphere suits you. You can take a loooooong beach walk at Xpu Ha where you are limited at Akumal and Grand Mayan. The sand just about everywhere is as soft as talcum powder. Playa del Carmen \u2013 Just a warning that the traffic going north and south through here can be very slow. They are building an overpass that will take at least a couple more years to complete. Make sure to calculate a good 30 minutes just to get through here. We experienced both slow and fast traffic. We also made the requisite visit to the 5th Avenue walking street. Gads! Aggressive vendors along the way. \u201cMira! Come look! Good price for you!\u201d And if you\u2019re wearing the mandatory Grand Mayan wrist band: \u201cHey! How are they treating you at the Grand Mayan?!\u201d I\u2019ve done my share of bargaining and shopping in the past and now it turns me off so we didn\u2019t stay more than an hour. Photos at Grand Mayan \u2013 We did these. We put on our color-coordinated outfits and had some outdoor photos taken by Gabriel \u2013 photographer extraordinaire. We figure they might come in handy for our obituary photo showing us when we were younger and vital. My gosh but he worked hard and took lots and lots of shots of us in various poses: walking the beach, splashed by waves, garden greenery, jumping in the air, and Havana Moon restaurant \u2013 at least 150-170 photos in all \u2013 and wonderful, artistic framing. Plus, the color is unbeatable. In the end, we only selected five high res (12 mg) photos which were dropped down to a cd (they don\u2019t print hard copies but you own the image). There\u2019s no cost for the session, but each image costs $30 up to about 10 and then they have packages after that. The photos are color corrected and dark facial shadows (which come with photos in bright sun) are removed. It\u2019s a chance to have stunning studio quality photos taken that you might never get otherwise. They will make great holiday gifts. This is what we choose to spend our money on instead of restaurant meals. So that\u2019s about it. We always felt safe. There are machine gun toting polizia all along route 307. We didn\u2019t visit any Mayan ruins as we had already been to Tulum and Chichen Itza last time and once feels like enough in the sun, heat, and humidity. Altogether, we had a low-key, very safe, very relaxing time in Cancun.", "Date": "December 8, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Connecticut", "Title": "\u201cFabulous People and Resort-You learn to enjoy the walking\u201d", "Author": "ShouldIgotoFjii", "ReviewID": "UR88367866", "Content": "Having been to many hot/beach destinations, I have concluded the people in Riviera Maya and this hotel are the nicest on earth.

For negativies: the rooms are literally 3/4 of a mile away (I used my I-pod to measure it) from the pool and the shuttle service is terrible in terms of never being available. If you're like us, you can adapt to these little nuisances when in such a beautiful and warm location. By day 4, we looked forward to the walks as a way to burn off the fabulous pina coladas. You also can't swim in the ocean due to the rocky beach but the pools are fabulous. I can honestly say I didn't miss the beach. The \"Wine Bar\" is pretty cool but all of the bars close at 11 so be prepared to head to Playa del Carmen for nightlife. If we had to do it over, we would get a hotel in Playa del Carmen due to the constant activity as we're not fans of going to be at 11 or getting a taxi to drive us 20 minutes to the action.

One snafu... We booked a tour with them and the shuttle bus company didn't have us on the list. When we realized we had not been picked up, we complained, heavily, and they paid for a taxi to catch up with the shuttle bus. The rooms are clean and well kept. Nice bathroom. NO OCEAN VIEW FROM ANY ROOM. If you have been told you have an ocean view you were lied to or the travel agent doesn't have a clue. There are no ocean view rooms with Grand Maya or the Mayan Palace (they are on the same grounds). The grounds are beautiful and exceptionally manicured. There are walking paths everywhere and, depending on which building you are staying in, it can be a long trek to the pools and beach. The pools are amazing and massive. The beach is OK but rocky and to swim you must walk over underwater rocks. I highly recommend water shoes if you want to swim. There are plenty of palm trees for shade. We had no problem getting lounge chairs around the pool or beach, but we were there in the off season. The pool bar was great, service good and friendly and they didn't chintz on the alcohol. If you want a drink that is made in a coconut (coconut monkey - I think) get there early because they run out of coconuts by mid afternoon. Never got one. Food is expensive for what you get. It's not bad but I don't like paying $100-$200 for three people for a meal I could have bought at Applebees or Chilis for half the price. If you eat three meals a day, snacks and drink a lot I recommend the all-inclusive. Cooking in your room can be expensive if you buy from the market on the resort. Going into town is $20 one-way by taxi, so we did the math, bought some staples for morning, had liquid lunch (wink, wink) and a good dinner. We left the resort with a $2,000 bill for the three of us and that included all expenses including the tour for 3, a spa day for 2 girls and some extra things. This is a NO CASH resort, so you give them your room number and its charged, whatever you buy. Coffee is expensive at the cafe. Make it in your room. The buffet dinner at Delagos is very, very good as far as food goes. The show was a typical, Mexicana Resort show. A bit cheesy but they put a lot of effort into it. Beware of people trying to sell you things during this show. A man/woman will come to your table and ask the names of the people in your party. He's dressed like all the other workers and you'll think nothing of it. He is selling decorative cards that are personalized. They do give you free straw hats and free fans when you enter. Do Go if you are a family with small kids. They have lots of recreational activities for children, and adults, but your kids will love the pool. If you are an adult wanting to party, go during the on season or you won't see much night life or action. Don't go if you are looking for the night seen and lots of bars unless you are willing to pay taxi fees or shuttle fees. One other thing....the band the resort puts on your wrist identifies what resort you are staying at. The vendors in town can spot each person and where they are staying 100 feet away. They prey upon that. I recommend taking a bandana and wrapping around your band so they can't see it.

The one negative that I found was the extensive marketing program for their fractional ownership of current and future Grand Mayan facilities at various places throughout Mexico, including the Riviera Maya facility itself. They promise a short 2 hour tour and presentation with the promise of multiple gifts, a free breakfast and discounts for attending. It turned out to be a very long 5 hour ordeal, and we were besieged by no less than 6 different very determined sales and other individuals pushing hard for us to buy their offerings. There are many reviews on different internet sites describing the scams and the high pressure tactics used on these Grand Mayan fractional ownership presentations. Needless to say that neither I nor any members of my family purchased any of their offerings. The intense high pressure tactics of these presentations is the one negative of this resort. If you go to the Grand Mayan do yourself a favor and stay away from anyone offering freebies to attend one of these presentations.

They tried talking to us and we just walked away. :) So we didn't let that ruin our trip. However, When we went to breakfast at the del Largo Restaurant I can see the sales people are everywhere and there are a lot of unhappy people with these reps.

My 13 year old son loved lounging around the Sanctuary Pool a very exclusive classy place with outdoor beds where you can nap, interesting shaped resting places, one day I found him in a lounge shaped like a teepee, another in a bananna peel. Bring your matching, non patterned clothes for a professional family pic, session is free, pics are unique and very cool and they cost $30 each for a digital image you own and can print or download as much as you want.. a bargain!! I am pretty frugal and found that the store is just a little more than a grocery store and to me it was not worth a 20 minute drive anywhere to buy juice, eggs, milk and an occasional deli sandwich and pizza- all tasty and saved a lot of $$ on the final bill. Bring your own coffee filters, coffee, sugar packets, sweet low, packaged foods and save even more. You can do laundry for about $8/load fyi, they provide everything for that. Restaurants were amazing: the blue fish on the way in when you're waiting for your room yum, Frida's is the very best (mexican), and Gong, sushi, asian was delicious and very sophisticated...averaged about $70 lunch, $100 dinner for a family of four, much like at home.

Our family owns a timeshare with this resort. We rented the two bedroom grand master suite, ideal for more than one couple who wants privacy (the second room has access to the main room, but has its own entrance). The resort is large, so don't plan to walk out your room onto the beach. There aren't any ocean view rooms per se with the way the buildings are situated. We spent most of our time by the pool bar. Great service. What they didn't tell us, though we heard from other visitors, is that you don't have to pay a rental fee for a palapa bed if you are ordering at least $35 in drinks/food while you are out there. Otherwise, if you don't plan on ordering drinks or food, you pay the fee. So, we had lunch and drinks on our palapa beds, but only several days into our trip. We're biased because we really aren't into the large resort feel and we prefer something cozier, but for a large resort, it's a really nice resort with nice accommodations and the grounds are beautiful. The beach is nice, but don't expect to walk in the ocean without shoes of some sort. There's lots of exposed coral since the hurricanes years back, and the lifeguards don't recommend this barefoot. The only problem with us is when we set up our rooms upon arrival, the desk clerk kept insisting that we have our room # as 102-1 and 102-2 as an example. So, since it's a no cash resort, everything gets charged to your room. Well, our orders were completely intermingled with our guests orders, and we spent a good deal of time sorting it out upon check out, which was really disappointing. What they normally do, when our parents go each year and take guests, is set it up with two entirely different room #'s to avoid this confusion. For those not familiar with it, you give your credit card number upon arrival, they \"pre-charge\" your credit card up to say $500. Once you reach that $500, they are supposed to call you to authorize another $500 charge. Well, they never called our friends to let them know, so they were thinking they didn't reach the $500 limit, but then upon checkout they ended up paying $600 or more in charges. Very disappointing. Everything gets charged to the room. Also, if you spend time at the pool bar or elsewhere, don't count on the fact that you are receiving the proper bill. If you receive a bill with someone else's name on it and sign for those charges, you are responsible for paying those charges. Watch what you sign. When you've got 10 patrons at the pool bar and several different bartenders, don't rely on them to keep everything straight, including your name. Overall, we were happy with our stay. There are pools closer to the beach that are more family and activity oriented, and other pools closer to the front desk that are more private, secluded and very romantic. So, it has a little to offer for just about any age, including a kiddie pool for those with small children. The rooms are nice, contemporary, clean with a dipping pool on the balcony, and in each of our rooms were large jacuzzis. The bathrooms are equipped with a walk in marble shower, a large double sink, and a private stall with the commode. The main room has a full kitchen, with the exception of an oven, so don't plan on baking any pizzas. We took the cab into town to Walmart and picked up groceries for the week to make some meals in our room, to save on costs. For four people, taking a cab is less costly than 4 taking a shuttle to Playa Del Carmen, and much more convenient. For two people, taking a shuttle would be more economical. We spent our last day at Xcarat national park, and stayed for the evening show, including the outrageously overpriced dinner that wasn't very good. Don't do it. Our friends liked the show, we were disappointed, so it's just a matter of personal taste. The Wednesday (?) evening show at the resort is WAAAAAYYYY more entertaining, in our opinion. Karaoke is also fun, even if only to watch, for entertainment. There's also a spa on site where they offer a multitude of services including massages, use of the facilities and mani/pedicures. All in all, it's a beautiful resort with lots to offer, as long as you don't mind the large resort feel.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cI've Been To A Lot of Places, But This Resort is THEE BEST By Far!

We'd never been to mexico and this trip was amazing. We loved the resort, the pools, the staff and ocean. What people say about the resort being large is true. But for a young married couple in their mid-20's we had no problem with walking around the resort. And by the end of the week it seemed like nothing to walk to the pools or restaurants. We were never harrased about the timeshare presentation, it wasn't even mentioned, so i'm not sure if it's because we were transfer with another timeshare or if they've changed their tactics. The pools are very large and nice, we spent most of our time in the private \"Grand Mayan Guests Only\" pool cause it was a bit smaller and the service was better cause they didn't have such a large area to cover. Restaurants were good, we loved Havana Moon and spent three meals there. We didn't think the breakfast buffet at Del Lago was worth $25/person. We enjoyed a nice lunch at the restaurant by the pool, but nothing on their dinner menu interested us. We bought breakfast foods (cereal/bread) from the store and made that in our room every morning to cut down on costs. Coronas were $5, so my husband enjoyed those our whole visit. We loved the activity staff, they were a ton of fun and added to our amazing week. They had a beach night where they tought you salsa and morengi (sp?), they had a casino night where you'd play poker or black jack with \"fake money\" to win resort cash. They had bingo and water arobics every day. They were quick to learn your names and where you were from and always called out when you'd walk by.

The ocean seemed miles away and the beach is very rocky - there were visible reefs sticky out of the water. The swimming pool was probably the biggest I've ever seen - but it was half drained out - bcuz of cleaning? You get nickeled and dimed for everything. $950 pesos/ week for wifi. $100 pesos/day for the gym.

We did get a very nice 2bdrm to stay in but they insisted that we traded our no stings attached Hawaii property for what they reffered to as a \"marketing week\". So we were forced into a timeshare presentation on the first morning (we were told we would get coffee and breakfast included w/the presentation). They did feed and give us coffee but only after about an hour of talking to us about their location, now picture yourself on vaction....the first morning after your late arrival to the hotel......and being a little groggy.....no coffe available....but you could smell it in the distance.....and they kept saying (for about an hour) coffee will be avaiolable in just a minute.

After about a marathon 4 hour session they finally let us out so we could start our vacation. They tolod us that we would get a few comps that would be attached to our room bill.....discounts on room service and also a credit of about $80 we could use at their restraunt/bar.

We were again treated like common bums when we insisted that we were to get the perks that they promised us.....after about another hour (they even offered to let us go back to another presentation!), they finally gave us most of the promised perks.

The room and resort amenities are awesome. The pool is the best I have ever seen. The security control is very good at entry and exit. When we checked in they tied a bracelet on our right hand and asked us to keep it till we leave. We got rid of this the very next day telling this is not an 'HOSPITAL'. This is very strange which we have experienced only in theme parks. Please do not get in to the timeshare presentation though you may save couple of 100s of USD. But the Xcaret basic ticket they provide is costlier than the online price. They will tell it is only 65$ and outside it is 120+ tax which is a lie. Also when you change it to Xcaret plus in the park you need to pay additional 39 USD per entry. It is not worth. The resort credit of 1200 pesos will not help you much unless you use internet which is 170 pesos per day. The timeshare presentation starts nicely, promising only 90 mins, but gets in to harassment. It can even go upto 4 hrs. They will start with 25 to 30 K initially and then finally beg for 3000 USD. They will give everything in the world free to attract you. As such HSI is not a great timeshare company (read the reviews in internet before you decide). We understand the timeshare concept very well being the member of worlds largest timeshare company for 4 yrs. So we escaped. We had to finally say \"Just Stop it here\" to end the presentation. It is multi level..one after the othr will provide discounts....not a good way to start the vacation.... Staying here you may need a rental vehicle... beware the car rental company may be starting point of the timeshare presentation... Playa del carmen is just 20 mins away, Xcaret and Xplor are nearby. Xel-Ha & Tulum is just 1hr 15 mins away. Do not miss Xel-Ha. The best experience you can have in Quantana Roo (the number one VOW factor in this region). Xcaret is not worth the hype.

My wife had never been to Mexico, and I had stayed in Cancun previously. We traded our week at our 3 bedroom timeshare for a 2 bedroom unit at the Grand Mayan Riviera Maya (GMRM). We rented a compact car for the week from Ace Rent-A-Car (Ace rents cars owned by Executive Rent-a-car at the airport). Renting a car is nice unless you plan to lounge around the resort all week or have only a few day trips planned. The GMRM offers free transportation from the airport to the resort, but you will have to pay $15/person to get back to the airport at the end of your stay. You can always rent a car at the GMRM on the days you plan to leave the resort, but we preferred more freedom without having to deal with thinking out the logistics and the stress of making a decision on whether to spend extra money for a car on a daily basis (vacations tend to be better on me when we work these things out front because I can be cheap). The resort has free parking, but sometimes you will have to utilize the valet (free, other than tips you want to provide them), as the normal parking lots get filled up. When you check in, GMRM requires that you deposit around $600 for food and services you charge to the room, since they have a \"no cash policy\". This works out great, as you can leave your wallet in the room, just like you would at an all inclusive resort, but you get to plan how much money you are going to spend at the resort each day. We prefer this type of setup, as it seems to benefit those that do a lot of day trips over all-inclusive resorts. They do automatically include taxes and gratuities into your food and drinks, so be prepared for this. All billing was correct at the end of our trip. In addition, when you are checking in, they will introduce you to someone that will try to set you up for a \"welcome breakfast\". We told them that we already have activities planned and would have to consider when we could fit it into our schedule. They try to tell you that they want you to go as early as possible in the week as they can introduce you to the resort, and you will start receiving 10% off of all services/food purchased at the resort after you attend the \"welcome breakfast\". If you feel that 1.5 to 3 hours of your hard earned vacation are worth the benefits they offer, good luck not being frustrated for several hours after the presentation from the pressure they put on you. They tried to call us later in the week to set something up, but we just ignored the offer again. Rooms on the bottom floor of the resort likely get more bugs in the rooms, so we laid towels at the bottom of the door each night to try to reduce this. The halls have tile floors, so they echo, so you may hear people entering and leaving your building in the mornings or at night. We had a Coati, a huge blue crab, and a scorpion visit our unit during our stay, which are just part of the wildlife available on the resort site. They have a crocodile pond and a flamingo area , which are fun to stop by on your way to the endless pools on the site. Many iguanas, geckos and bird species inhabit the resorts around the grounds. The pools are amazing, and you can easily find at least one that gives you some privacy or some form of entertainment (pool bars, volleyball, etc). They have areas where they have activities for children, and one night we caught them having a kids movie event where they watched pirate movies with big pirate flags and other decorations (they really made it cool for the kids). We don't have kids, but noted that they had lots of daily activities planned for the kids. They also have daily happy hour and other fun events planned for adults. The beach is not good for swimming, but you can do a little snorkeling, lay out, and get in the water to cool off in less than waist deep water. They are trying to do some things to \"improve\" the beach, but it is going to take away from the natural beauty of the beach here because the people that complain are the ones that get what they want. They should tout the value of the resource that they have rather than trying to make everything \"ideal\" for the greed of selling this resort (many of the resorts in the Cancun Hotel Zone already offer \"swimable beaches\", so there is already a large supply in the area available). I didn't play golf, but the course looked well maintained. Rounds of golf are fairly priced. One of our favorite parts of the GMRM was its location (people that do not rent a car, think taxis cost too much, or dislike waiting on public transportation may not agree). The resort is a short drive from Playa Del Carmen, and was in the middle of many of the activities that my wife and I wanted to do. If you are trying to decide between GMRM and another resort, try GMRM out, it is amazing. Again, avoid the sales presentation and you will improve your opinion and experience. Day trips we enjoyed (we drove ourselves) were Cozumel, Chitzen Itza, Tulum, Hidden Worlds Cenotes, and XelHa. Remember to be prepared to tip just about anyone that provides you a service in Mexico.

If you take the transit, the shuttle will take you to the main gate, you have to cross both highways on foot. Crossing is a bit dangerous, but if you use common sense, you'll be fine. Make sure you get into the correct vehicle. Groceries are expensive at the resort. We went to the Mega store for ours. Beware, it's not like home! We opted for packaged / canned items. None of the eggs were in coolers. There was no mistaking were the fish isle was. Oh, the ramp you have to push your cart on is magnetized. We felt a bit silly trying to pull it back. LOL Don't know Spanish, no problem, there always seemed to be someone around who spoke English. The shore along the beach was more rock then sand, but it was very beautiful. There were plenty of chairs & it too never seemed to be crowded. If you are looking for a romantic location, this would be perfect!

We did spend 1 whole day at the resort, enyoing the place The resort is credit only no cash is needed, they have 9 restaurants, We order at the pool what we thought was a small snack we payed $90 something for our order! but it was GOOD =) There is a Deli for milk, cookies, sodas ect, ( we took a trip to WALMART and stocked up on food) All the employees were very friendly & helpful, The kids loved to ride on the car that would take us back & forth to our room & to the pools ( we never waited more than 5 minutes for the pick up. DO WEAR BUG SPRAY!! There's LOTS & LOTS of mosquitos =( ALL over CANCUN/PLAYA DEL CARMEN Our last day we decided to go to the Del Lago Restaurant ( PLEASE make sure you make a reservation a few days before going or early & request a table front of the stage ) We didn't and were placed in the back far from the stage =( We meet a nice couple on the resort that did do the presentation and said NO to all the sales & did receive the 10% discount plus a FREE message , maybe if we would of done it and said NO we could of saved some money on our bill? Over ALL this is a great place ..KIDS LOVED IT!! WE LOVED IT!! We tried to book it again for next year, But they have a 5 year policy =(", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Arlington, Virginia", "Title": "\u201cGreat place for honeymoon!\u201d", "Author": "karankapoor16", "ReviewID": "UR73325756", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Mayan hotel during the last week of July. The hotel shuttle picked us up promptly from the airport, which was really nice! Pros of the resort: -Amazing pool areas. The pools are really extensive and the pool bars are great! They have beds near the pools you need to reserve. There is a minimum amount that needs to be spent to get a bed,but are well worth it since they are very comfortable. -Variety of food on the resort is great - they have Asian, Italian, and general dining areas. -The beach/ocean is really beautiful. Like other reviews state, you cannot go into the ocean and swim but the beach is still really nice. -Spa / Massage area - we had a couples massage for our honeymoon and it was really relaxing. The price might seem expensive but when you compare it to other cities in the US it actually is quite reasonable. -Special Requests: I informed the concierge desk it was our honeymoon and I asked for a room with a low building number. The concierge fulfilled my request and decorated the room with balloons and towels shaped like swans. We also got a jacuzzi in our room which was amazing. My wife loved it! -Overall service: Great! The room was always cleaned, the bellboys always provided drinks / food right away. Negatives: -The walls are pretty thin so you can hear what your neighbors are doing at times. Around dinner time, I could always hear plates banging around from the place next door. Also, some nights we went to bed early and the neighbors would wake us up when they returned later on in the night. -Pricing for food: As expected, it's a resort so prices will be higher than normal places. If you want to eat cheap, order a pizza. Otherwise expect to pay resort prices. We expected this going into the place so we were not surprised by the prices. -The beds were a little hard for my wife, I did not notice this. We both slept great through the week though. -No free wifi. We didn't expect to get free wifi, but if they had the 30 minute option like they do at the business center, that would have been nice. Not having internet was probably better for the honeymoon :-) Overall: I recommend this resort to anyone looking for a mini vacation with family, or for couples.

NO CASH is accepted * If you\u2019re staying at the Grand be sure to venture to the MAYAN PALACE and check out their POOLS. I didn\u2019t venture out that way and missed a day or two of those expansive and beautiful pools. Honestly, I think the water in those pools are warmer. And there is BEACH FRONT there as well. * The SPA is excellent. Great service and attention to detail. You can use the changing rooms and showers there until around 8pm, I think. So feel free to swim and bring your clothes and change and shower there instead of hauling yourself to your room * Go to the MEGA NOT WALLMART in Playa de Carmen and BUY FOOD * The store on site is hella expensive * Take the shuttles to Playa de Carmen and go to the Mega there. Don\u2019t be afraid to take a taxi back instead of trying to make the shuttle. It\u2019s actually CHEAPER to take a TAXI * People in town negotiate everything. Don\u2019t get HUSTLED by the TOUR GUIDES provided by the RESORT. Go into town and setup your own excursions. * People\u2019s sense of time is wacked in Mexico. 15mins = 45mins. Be aware of that * The little carts that drive you to and from your room to the lobby area lag. A lot of times you can get there faster by just walking * Bring BUG SPRAY, you will need it. Mosquitos there don\u2019t play around * They have a restaurant, I think it\u2019s called Frida\u2019s, that serves AWESOME TACOS late night until like 10-11pm.

It was an awesome week with few exceptions. I'll not go into great detail but give you a few things that would have helped us out a bit - some of these were probably in reviews that I passed over. We stayed in Building 9 in THE JUNGLE. We had a two bedroom unit that had a king bed and sleeper sofa in each room as well as two sleeper sofas in the living/kitchen area. The beds were firm but really nice. The A/C was awesome! There was a nice deck with a dipping pool but we never used it as we thought it might look like a fondue set for the mosquitoes. The kitchen is barely equipped - I don't think many people use it. It had: stove top, toaster, blender, coffee maker, microwave, refrigerator and freezer (small), plates, bowls, glasses, wine glasses, silverware, corkscrew, can opener, and a big spoon. Not equipped for a real meal or any sort of cooking. The pools were excellent. They are all the same depth (about 3.5 feet) and really warm. The servers come around all day long but they don't bug you to buy stuff. Take advantage of happy hour if you\"re into that (11-1). The swim up bars are nice as well. We used both the sanctuary pool and the 24 hr pool at the Palace. The walk is not as bad as talked about here. Our walk was about 8 minutes so if the shuttle didn't show up right away we just walked. The shuttles run about every 10-15 minutes. The mosquitoes are the baddest dudes you'll ever encounter! Bring some repellent if they are attracted to you. The shuttle to Playa is $4/person and runs right on schedule. It drops you close to 5th ave which is where all of the shopping is. It's also close to MEGA and WALMART. We shopped at Mega twice and thought it was well priced and easy to navigate. Taxi's to and from Playa are $20 so consider taking the shuttle in and finding a taxi back. We went to Chichen Itza and would highly recommend that excursion. We hired a guide outside of the entry gate. The posted price is $600 pesos. We piad $400 and probably could have gone lower. The tour was excellent and the guide stayed with us for about 90 minutes after which we wandered around by ourselves. We opted to rent a car and save some money. It's about a 3 hour drive and well signed. We didn't get pulled over and tried hard to figure out the speed limit signs which seemed to change every 100 yards at times. Ask the people you rent the car from to explain the speed limit signs! On one of our shuttle rides to Playa we happened on a driver that was booking a tour that included TULUM (more ruins), AKUMEL (snorkeling) and Crystolino (cenote) for $30 usd per person. That was only transportation but it was excellent. After doing Chichen Itza we felt like we had a handle on the history and Tulum was excellent. Akumel was also spectacular. We rented snorkeling gear for $12 for the day. The family snorkeled in a very calm area and saw sea turtles, sting ray, and lots of fish. There's a coral reef that you can snorkel to as well. The cenote was cool - $4 per person and there was swimming in cool clear water as well as some cliff jumping - very tame. The shuttle driver's name was RICKY. You might be able to find him through the concierge or bellmen. OK, so here's the one you've read about. The sales presentation was brutal. They promise 90 minutes including breakfast. My wife and I are bargain hunters and they offered 10% off of everything charged to your room which would include restaurants, snacks, groceries at the little store, drinks at the pool, etc. SOOOOOOO, we decided, against our better judgment, to go for it and just be firm with the time. OK, not possible unless you are willing to just be plain rude. We were with one lady at breakfast (which is another perk and very good) who then walked us to the presentation room and proceeded to go from the $149,000 pkg all the way down to the $19,400 pkg and EVERYTHING in between. When we finally got her to understand we weren't buying she passed us off to her manager who tried again. We're now into almost 4 hrs including breakfast. They take us over to the sign out table where one guy says he's going to sign us out but he has some exit questions. A new sales presentation begins and this is for HSI (a glorified RCI) and that price SLOWLY goes from $9800 with two cruises all the way down to $5000 with four cruises. Now we're into 5 hours and we're done. EXHAUSTING! Here's what I would do if I had it to do again. Have breakfast and at the table tell the salesperson that after 90 minutes you are going to make your decision. Let them know that they need to get to the point and lay it out clearly because after 90 minutes there won't be any more sales going on. If it looks do-able you'll buy, if not, you walk. Some other little things. 1. MOSQUITOES 2. Take a taxi back to the airport - $32 vs the $15/person charge 3. JADE is a deli and very good 4. The Del Lago buffet was great for breakfast/brunch 5. Ask lots of questions while you're there - people are really helpful 6. Wireless internet was available for almost $80/week 7. La Paria in Playa was excellent!

If you don\u2019t like walking, the shuttle runs at all times. Few other things: TRANSPORTATION: e-mail or call the concierge for a free pick up. Make sure you read the instructions on the e-mail.

No problems at all if you obey the rules and don\u2019t drink and drive. I felt safe at all times. Common sense goes a long way. FOOD : Everything we had at the resort was excellent.

If you want to book the return shuttle to the airport, let the concierge now and the $15 per person will be charged to your room bill. This is not our first time at the Grand Mayan/Mayan Palace, and since the resort is well maintained and kept, one cannot expect it to be cheap when it comes to food and drink. Of course you have the option to drive to Playa del Carmen and go shopping at Walmart or Mega. When my husband and I are on vacation we want to relax and not worry about cooking/cleaning. Breakfast at Green Break ($14 for Buffet or $10 for Continental) which includes juices, coffee and tea, was very adequate. The Del Lago Buffet is extensive and I could not eat all the things that are offered there. Our favorite restaurant is the Tramonto which has great service and wonderful food. Our favorite waiter there, Carlos Arturo, is a gem. All other restaurants as well as the pool side service is exceptional and the wait staff works hard to please the guests. We stayed in Building 2 and had no complaints with our suite on the top floor. The weather was not the best during our week and one day it rained hard; we decided to take the Shuttle to Playa del Carmen and browsed the stores. Most people who write reviews about the Grand Mayan/Mayan Palace, have complaints about the sales office. It is tempting to receive 1000 pesos and 10% off the bill but when the presentation gets to long winded and pressured, then the bad reviews can be read. I suggest if you are not interested in buying a time share, decline the presentation. By the way, one reviewer wrote that one week was offered to them for $150,000 which is a ficticious number. We are Grand Mayan owners and on and off attend the \"update\" presentations but if the pressure gets to much, we walk away. This time we actually attended and upgraded to their new project, the Private Residence Club. To sum it up, the Grand Mayan is a large resort, so some guests have to use the shuttle to get to the pools and beach if they don't want to walk, but it is a well kept place with friendly staff who work hard to please the guests. The beach is a sore point because it is not swimable but one can wade into the water and explore fish life close by.

I wish I had paid more attention KSeattle70\u2019s review from 14 June, which was spot on - except for the recommendation to do the underground river snorkeling at Excaret. The underground river snorkeling at Excaret consisted of long lines to get pay deposits and get snorkeling gear, and then a very boring drift through mostly underground caves in cloudy water. There was no need for a mask, as the water remained too murky to see anything. Otherwise, Excaret has OK beaches and restaurants. They Mayan ruins at Tulum were easily reached by rental car and were breathtaking. There was a very nice beach just below the ruins. A rental car is recommended for this trip. The Grand Mayan was an exceptionally beautiful and well maintained property, with very friendly hotel staff. We tried to stay in the lower numbered buildings (1-6) to be within walking distance of most activities; but were marooned to building 10, which required shuttle trams and occasional 30 minute waits. The kids love the pools at the Grand Mayan and access to the larger pool at the Mayan Palace. This would have been an exceptionally memorable vacation, but was marred by the shabby treatment we received from the sales staff. As addressed by other reviewers, they promised (lied) about a 1-1/2 hour no-pressure sales presentation, then relentlessly pressured us to allow them to cash in the equity in our other timeshares and buy into the Mayan. Arriving promptly at 8:15, we told them ahead that we had a shuttle to Playa del Carmen to catch at 11:00. While the initial sales rep (Salvadore) was very polite and did all he could to get us out on time, by 10:30 the first of three closers attacked us. They had the insolence to \u201crequire\u201d that we write down three reasons we did not want to buy before we could be dismissed to obtain our compensation (1000 pesos and 10% off some other expenses). Each closer was more aggressive than the last. We missed our shuttle and left feeling that this high quality resort was disgraced by the shabby sales tactics employed.

I exchanged two of my timeshare weeks to stay one week here and a second week at the Mayan Palace Riviera Maya. Rented a compact car from Payless Car Rental, great rate for 2 weeks through American Express website. One thing I wish we had done, was check the vehicle throughly. Our windshield wipers did not work well, and we actually needed them on 2 nights when we were out and it started raining. Prior to our trip, I emailed resort to request buildings 1-7, and a 3rd floor room. Followed up by a phone call to resort, since I never received confirmation of my request. We arrived at resort at 4 pm and our rental car was taken by the valet service. At checkin, you are asked for a credit card to use for all your resort charges. They put a hold of $8000 pesos, approximately $645 US dollars on your credit card. Fortunately, we were assigned building 5, third floor, and our rooms were at the end of the hall, corner rooms. I wanted to avoid the first floor, because of the noise. Usually everyone uses the hallways on the first floor to transit from one building to the next and avoid the hot sun. The rooms are very spacious, ours consisted of two Master suites with king size beds in each room, as well as a sofa with a pull out bed on the bottom. The living room also has another sofa with a pull out bed on bottom. My son preferred the sofa in the living room and gave his sister the king size bed. Extra pillows and blankets are in the closets. Three individual A/C units were in our suites, nice cool rooms after a hot day by the beach/pools. Shower is separate from jacuzzi tub, and master bedroom has two sinks. Kitchen is well equipped with a 4 burner stove, toaster, blender, microwave,pots, pans, and a small refrigerator. It was nice to prepare breakfast and snacks in our rooms when we didn't want to eat out. Balcony has a plunge pool, with a depth of maybe 18 inches, maybe to cool off. Honestly we never used it. Loungers and chairs are also available on the balcony. We drove to Playa del Carmen, about a 20 minute trip to buy groceries at Mega on Constituyentes. Some construction going on but nothing major. We never had an issue either finding Parking space or with the local poilce. Pay attention to the speed limit and the \"topes\" (speed bumps) . Grand Mayan guests have exclusive use of the Mayan Sanctuary. We found these pools to be a lot cooler than the ones at the Mayan Palace, which all guests can use. The mayan sanctuary, is a tranquil area, beautifully landscaped. Poolside cabanas are available without a fee, and waiters come around to take your food/drink orders. Between 11 am to 1 pm, 2 for 1 drinks. Then there is also, the drink of the day which is 50 % off all day. We enjoyed our poolside meals, and the waiters were great. If you plan to use the beach, it is advisable to take water shoes with you. There is sharp coral as you enter beach and we also observed sea urchins when we snorkeled there. Waiters are also here, so no need to leave your palapa to get a drink or order food. We had a wonderful time here, and enjoyed the resort. The buffet breakfast was varied and delicious! Room service was quick and affordable. The staff comes in twice a day, once in the morning to clean your room, and at night to do a \"turn down service\" and leave KISSES chocolates by your pillows. Kiddos loved this! We tipped our housekeeping staff daily, they did a wonderful job. Wifi is available in rooms, cost was $170 pesos daily for 24 hrs or a weekly rate of $950 pesos. Since we had a rental car, we visited XPLOR park, Akumal beach, Yak Kul lagoon, Isla Mujeres,Puerto Morelos and a nice, calm beach called Playa Maroma which is a 10 minute drive from resort. They charge $100 pesos per person, but it had a calm beach with very few people there. Showers, restrooms, and restaurant available.

We did rent a car both years as we like to get out and like the convenience of a car. We rented with Easy Car Rental as they were cheaper than the bigger outfits and had absolutely no problems with the cars or when we returned the car. Driving on the highway was very easy and we have never had any problem with the police. Driving in PDC can be a little hectic if you are not used to driving in a lot of traffic and currently it is very congested due to all the construction on 307. Snorkeling in Akumal is unbeatable. We always saw turtles, rays, barracuda and of course lots of fish and corral. The beaches in Akumal and Tulum are gorgeous they are absolutely a must see. Yes the beach at the resort is very rocky but certainly swimmable if you have water shoes. The beaches in PDC are also very nice so finding beautiful beaches to swim in is very easy. We also took a day trip to Cozumel and rented a car there. As with almost everything in Mexico the prices for the car are very negotiable. We found $50 to $60 for an air conditioned car with automatic transmission to be about as low as they would go. The western side of Cozumel is beautiful but deserted. For our family the Grand Mayan was perfect if you are down there to party this may not be your place.

It's closer to Playa del Carmen along the Mayan Riviera. It's a very expansive and well manicured resort with a maze of well kept pools, guest buildings, eateries, photo spots (flamingos, iguanas, etc) and a beautifully appointed spa! Check in at the thatched roof lobby was fast and effecient. Immediately after check-in we were approached by the time-share sales people who are crawling all over unsuspecting guests...they're the folks asking you whether or not you will be golfing or sight seeing during your stay; Just walk away!!! They'll bait you with free golfing and sight seeing tours. These tours cost very little cash, so don't tie up an entire day of your vacation listening to these aggressive sales weasles pitching their wares! The resort rooms are incredibly spacious and clean. Very nice jaccuzi tubs in every room-a nice touch! Also, large seperate shower and private toilet in the bathroom. The toiletries provided were top notch quality. All rooms have a private balcony. We required service when we noticed our A/C making some noise. Literally, ten minutes after we placed the call, a service technician was at the door! A follow up phone call came a few hours later. They wanted to ensure that the A/C was quiet and that the tech was professional and courteous. He was both. We can't say enough about the food. Many options were available, our favorite being the combo gift shop/mini-convenience store that included a deli, ice cream shop and crepe shop!! The deli made sumptuous paninis, salads and sandwiches. We enjoyed the amazing wine bar and restaurant attached to the gift shop! The room service was fast and efficient with food that was just as tasty as that found in some of the restaurants. Pools were scattered all over the resort. They're spectacular!!! Some cater to adults, some for kiddies and everything in between. We especially enjoyed an adult area pool with swim up bar and private cabanas (with privacy curtains)! Poolside waitservice was available for those unwilling to interrupt their relaxation to acquire their own snacks and drinks! We did spend several nights down the road in Playa del Carmen. It's a 20 minute ride from the resort. Be sure to take the public transportation- available outside the resort instead of the transportation available thru the resort. It's $2 each way per person on public transportation versus the $8 (plus tip) each way for the resort's van. The Playa del Carmen beaches are infinitely better than those at the resort. The resort beach is almost unusable because of rocks and rough, rough terrain. Restaurants on the beach in Playa are wonderful. Aside from the many pubs, the shopping is excellent!! Also, there's a WalMart there. We shopped for price comparison and found it insanely inexpensive. We purchased produce and bakery items to take back to our home away from home! Much, much less spendy than the resort gift shop. Fabulous lobster and steaks, terrific local fare that is surprisingly inexpensive and tasty! Trips to the Mayan ruins are offered thru the resort and private companies all over the area. We chose to visit the Chichen Itza. It was amazing. Steer clear of the tours that include a visit to a Mayan village... it's just an overpriced tourist area where you're heavily pressured to make purchases of \"real Mayan\" liquor and overpriced silver jewelery. The ruins at Tulum are just 45 min from the resort. Cozumel is less than an hour away from the resort via ferry boat that leaves Playa del Carmen several times daily. We loved the resort and would recommend it to couples or families. It's very kid friendly with lots of kid activities! For couples, there are plenty of options for dining and activities that don't include little ones, so you feel like you're in an adults-only resort! It really is the best of both worlds. I'd recommend it to anyone that needs a nice place with second-to-none service, great food, sparkling pools and is in close proximity to everything local!", "Date": "June 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Minneapolis, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cGreat Honeymoon\u201d", "Author": "tuhde", "ReviewID": "UR68373379", "Content": "We had a great time at this resort.

Make sure you arrange your shuttle from the airport a few days before you leave, we didn't assuming there would be a shuttle waiting, but ended up paying for a taxi (which broke down on the way to the resort). Also just bypass very \u201cofficial looking\u201d personnel that will approach you at airport; we'd read reviews to watch for people selling you timeshares and still were suckered in... we thought they were to airport help to find the shuttle. Nope. They were hard to leave without being rude. Once there it is a very beautiful resort and is huge. We had some sore calf muscles after just a couple of days. Enjoyed walking the grounds, but it was confusing getting around we got lost a couple times. Taking the shuttle took too long for us, we were in building 5 so it wasn't worth the shuttle wait. (We'd requested building 1-5 knowing the distance of other buildings) Our unit (Grand Master Suite w/private pool) was very nice. Our kids loved the private pool, (really like a large bathtub with very cold water). The room(s) were great and could have slept many more than our 6. We didn't have too many problems with mosquitos. Take your own spray (too expensive to buy there) and just use at night, during the day was fine. The resort\u2019s water I was told it was \u201cfiltered\u201d and OK to use to brush your teeth but they suggested still drinking bottled water. The pools were fabulous! Our kids spent all day there a few days. We had to swim in every one. Even at night we loved swimming. The pool bar and happy hour (11-1) was wonderful! No drink limit on 2 for 1 and you can just ask for extra booze if its too watered down. We \"rented\" a palapa 2 times, but if you spend $35 dollars at the pool bar, or Balche for food it is free (and that is very easy to do!) The restaurants were all good. Great breakfast buffet at Del Lago. Wonderful food at Balche. At Havana Moon was great to eat on the patio and had pleasant music. We were disappointed in Gong. We'd all ordered sushi and each persons meal came out one by one, so by the time the last persons order was complete the first person had been done eating for about 30 minutes. All the staff was very nice and helpful and said \"Hola\" everytime they passed you. It has a beautiful beach but we wished there was a swim beach. Expenses: Everything on the resort is over priced, but was expected. Ex. Can of Coke 32 pesos ($2.50) The exchange rate when we went was good, about 13 pesos to a dollar. But outside the resort (gas stations and shops) they get to decide the rate. 10 pesos to a dollar. So do some haggling where you can. We hadn't planned on renting a car, we were just going to do the tours thru the resort, but after looking into it it was so much less expensive to rent a car and travel there ourselves. For Example: TULUM (which I would highly recommend) was 90 pesos ($68US) to rent a car for 6, gas was $40 and it was $5 each for admission (kids under 9 free). We paid $40 for a tour guide (which again I'd recommend) for a total of $173. The resort didn't have a tour with just Tulum, it was combined with Xehel for a full day tour at $139per adult. We didn't want to do both, so we just went on our own and stayed at the tulum beach as long as we wanted. We ended up going to a publlc beach later in the day since we had our own transportation. At first we were worried about driving ourselves, but it was just fine. The signage is easy to read and everyone we dealt with was very friendly. Xcarat was nice, but needs an entire day or more to see. Plan on walking a lot. Spent a day in Cancun shopping and walking the beach...very beautiful. We went the first part of June and it was extremely hot. Just plan on being sweaty the entire time if you go then. Maybe because it was June it wasn't very crowded and we had no problem finding chairs at the pool, getting a tee time or getting seating at restaurants.

In fact it was about the same size as a Plametto bug that I found in my room in Florida a few years ago. I didn't however squish the lizard like I did the bug.. The grounds were spotless. No cabbie tried to rip me off. Lots of dubbed in Mexican voices on the TV. NCIS is weird in spanish. All the staff says \"Hello or Holla or Something\".

We were there 5/29 - 6/5. Here's what I would say about this resort, it's aboslutely beautiful. The resort is big so get your walking shoes. They have a very beautiful walking path that meanders through the grounds and is lit at night. The grounds are really stunning. The landscaping is gorgeous, all the tropical trees and plants..and iguanas/lizards...but they stay away from you :-). The pools both at the Mayan Palace (sits on same property) and the Grand Mayan are outstanding. I love the nightlit pools at the Grand Mayan. Very romantic for night time swimming. Our room was amazing, we had I believe their largest unit, sleeps 8. Two master bedrooms, big bathrooms, living room, kitchenette, jacuzzi tub, baby pool on the patio (had 4chairs which was nice). The housekeepers did a very good job with our suite. The food was really good - Balche Pool Bar has typical poolside food. I would highly recommend Frida which is only open for dinner, amazing food (guacamole is a must try), tacos, drinks - everything was a winner. Havana Restaurant is in a beautiful setting. I don't eat seafood so there wasn't a lot on the menu for me. Del Lago has a superb (if not expensive) breakfast buffet. If you can eat a lot, I highly recommend it. One night we ordered the Pizza - not bad, not great, but not bad :-). I am a big neat and cleanliness freak and I must say I saw workers scrubbing the pool chairs, pools, surfaces everywhere at night. That was a good thing to see. It's VERY HOT in Mexico - be prepared to sweat and just leave the makeup behind. You won't want to put it on. Bring lots of suncreen. If you take excursion to Chichen Itza we recommend Blue Cenote dirving/swimming and of course the Pyramid and other ruins are specatular. You will get the speech at the end about how tips make up most of their earnings...I hate that. We always tip well when we travel but I don't like feeling guilted into it. We did the excursion to Excarat - really a fun day. Long but fun. Definitely do the Undergroup River Snorkeling. Truly, not really anything to see but the 45mins, 0.3mile rive cave swimming is pretty cool. Okay here's the only negative thing I have to say and I'm really surprised that in all the reviews I read before I went on vacation that no one really mentioned this. Unless you have a large group and plan to take LOTS of excursions DO NOT AGREE TO 'FREE' BREAKFAST for the morning after you check in. They tell you you will get 10% off anything you spend at resort (meals etc...) and discounted prices for excursions. The 10% isn't really worth it, but if you're planning on doing lots of excursions then maybe it's worth 4hrs of your life that you will never get back. First they will meet with you in an open area, the guy/gal will seem really nice, they just want to tell you about Grand Mayan and their properties, after about 30-45mins they will take you to breakfast buffet (free -NOT! trust me you will pay for it later and not with money) at Del Lago. After you have a very pleasant breakfast (at least I did), then it's off for a tour of their units. Very nice but if you've stayed at really nice hotels you won't be as stunned as they would want you to be. Then you're off to the 'House of Pain', 'Torture Chamber'...trust me, you too will name it. At the beginning they tell you it's only 1.5hr presentation. What we discovered as the week went on was that it was more like 4-4.5hrs for not just us but everyone else we ran into! OMG! The sales pressure was RIDICULOUS! They ignore any rationalization you may give for why you don't want to buy. They trot out person after person to try to convince you...and then at the end they try to make you feel like a complete idiot if you don't buy cuz their last offer is just sooooooo amazing. They like to draw lots of boxes to explain their deals. I got so mad when the FOURTH saleman came to our table I said 'If you draw another box I am going to get really mad'...so he drew circles. My advice is to skip the pain and head straight for the pool. After a few margaritas had dulled the pain I really had a wonderful vacation and I would very highly recommend the property and that region of Mexico.

We have vacationed at Grand Mayan facilities in San Jose Del Cabo and Acapulco and were very impressed so our comments are not directed at The Grand Mayan Group but rather at the Cancun Riviera Maya property. The facility is located in a heavily vegetated area which makes it very humid but also very lush and inviting. They have a lot of ponds and water ways that are left in a natural state. Mosquitoes were a problem which is noted in other reviews and we were on the third floor which was recommended. We were unable to sit out at night, even with mosquito repellent one of our guests had over 40 bites on them! The rooms are standard for The Grand Mayan, very nice. From a service standpoint the staff was great. From an accommodating stand point they left a lot to be desired. The main problem is that they are overly focused on SALES and not addressing the priorities and needs of existing owners. We had our very good friends with us as guest; we own the two bedroom suite. Our room was facing a service road with no view, as verified by sales this location was the worst on the property. When we approached management and staff they expressed no interest or desire in addressing our situation and moving us to a better room location. When we went to the sales presentation we made them aware of the situation and they said they would push some buttons and get our room changed because it was one of the least desirable locations (nothing happened). If you are not an owner and looking for golf this could be your place as they cater to the golfing cliental to a fault (SALES). We won\u2019t belabor the point but this is not a Grand Mayan owners resort; it is a sales vehicle, they collect large groups of east coast golf enthusiast and fly them down free, give them free golf, free accommodations in what should be the owner\u2019s accommodations \u2013 shame on them!

I would recommend this resort to anyone, however you need to make the best choice for you based on what your needs and desires are for your vacation. My husband and I just returned from a week stay at the Grand Mayan. My parents traded their RCI timeshare for us to use, so we did not pay anything more than the daily room tax and expenses, which made for an inexpensive trip on our end. We arranged for the airport shuttle to pick us up (email the concierge a few days prior to arriving) and did have to wait about 20 minutes but we easily found the transport staff after walking through the large mass of people outside the doors of the airport. I would not talk to anyone as you are coming out, as people try to coerce you into their taxi/shuttle for money. Check in time is not until 5 pm, which was a little late since we arrived around 12. However, the staff was very accommodating and gave us a 25% off coupon to use at Balache, the pool restaurant. We enjoyed the meal we had and the service is a little bit slow, but you are on vacation so there is no need to rush. Our room was a one bedroom suite in the \"Jungle\", which is the group of buildings father away from the main lobby, pools and restaurants. It is about a 10-15 minute walk but they have paved paths you can take that are lit at night as well. My husband and I didn't mind walking occassionally to work off some energy but if we wanted to take a shuttle, we never had to wait longer than 10 minutes. They have shuttles that pick up outside of the buildings and take you to the main lobby. The room was beautiful and very clean. It was unique with the dipping pool on the balcony. The kitchen was sufficient, as we purchased food for breakfast and lunch meals to have throughout the week. The maid service came into the room once during the day and once at night to turn down your bed. If you don't want them coming in, simply put the card in the slot saying that you do not want service. We locked all our valuables in the safe and never had a problem with any of our belongings. Honestly, I do not typcially bring many expensive items when travelling for my own piece of mind but I did not feel unsafe. We tipped our chambermaid at the beginning of the stay and our nightmaid at the end of the stay so we felt taken care of. The staff is very accommodating, we never had a bad experience. As far as the time share presentation goes, we were offered at the very beginning and we declined and were never bothered again. The grounds of the resort are kept up very well, no complaints there. I would suggest going to the Mega, not the Walmart in Playa Del Carmen. The Mega had more than enough of what we needed for the week and the small store in the resort was good for snacks or milk, since we didn't want it to spoil on the ride back from Playa. The shuttle from the resort is only $4/person per way, which is way cheaper compared to a $20 one way taxi. We did take a taxi several times when we went to Playa for dinner and shopping. We visited several restaurants in Playa and had great experiences at all. The beach is beautiful and was fun to visit one day since the beach at the resort is not swimmable. We spent most of our time relaxing by the pool at the resort. There were more than enough chairs and palapas to sit under. If you don't want to pay for the palapas with beds ($30 day), they have chairs under palapas that are free. There are so many different pools and spots to choose from, we never sat at the same spot. The Grand Mayan pool is very quiet and relaxing. The main pool is HUGE and there is a lot going on during the day, but there are quiet spots to relax as well. The 2 for 1 drink specials are during happy hour, which is 11-1 and you can get 2 for 1 on the drink of the day all day as well. We felt like that was a good deal and the drinks were strong, not watered down like I expected. We had a dinner at Havana Moon one night at sunset. It overlooks the beach, so that was nice but I don't recommend going there to eat. The food was mediocre for the price. Honestly, we had better food at Balache, the pool restaurant. The pizza from room service or at the pool was really good. On Fridays, Balache has a Mexican night and we heard great things about the food. We did not try the buffet, Gong (Asian cuisine) or Tramonto (Italian Steakhouse). The creperie in the deli was delicious as well. I would recommend going to Playa for at least one meal, since they have so many restaurants to chose from. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. We are not uptight travelers and just like to take it easy and relax on vacation. The resort does offer a kids program, which had activities every day and activities for adults on the resort grounds and excursions away.

The general store on the property had a good variety of essential food items.

Pools: were fantastic! The largest pool closest to the ocean more of the \"activity pool\" there are quite a few pool bars that we enjoyed spending time at. The BEST POOL was the Grand Mayan Lobby pool (great bc only Grand Mayan guests can use it.) It is VERY Quiet, and relaxing! It almost felt like we were in a bird sanctuary... we have been to many resorts in mexico and this was our favorite pool for relaxation... very beautiful! Day Activities: we LOVED bartender class! we also like water aerobics and nightly karaoke. I wish that they played more pool volleyball games- my family's favorite! Rooms: were decent. they cleaned daily and did a great job! The only downsides were the very small fridge and the beds are VERY uncomfortable!! we were pretty sore when we would wake up in the mornings. There was an ice machine which was nice. I took everyone else's advise and requested buildings 1-6..... The best thing we did!! There is a lot of walking.. but I couldn't imagine the walking if you were in a larger numbered building. Unfortanetly, the golf cart service is not very fast at all! The only other downside to this resort is that there is no ocean views... you have to walk to the beach to see it. Spa: Brio spa was okay. Not the greatest. we went just once to get a massage, which was nice but wouldn't recommend this resort if you are going solely for spa. So far, the best spa i have ever been to is Pueblo BOnito at sunset beach in Cabo. Resort photographer: you can get a free photo shoot, but just pay for the pics you want. highly recommend... the pictures were absolutely amazing (we also got lucky bc we had a rainbow over the ocean) my sister and her fiance actually used the resort photographer as their engagement pics and they are great!! Non-all-inclusive: was fine. drinks are expensive but take advantage of happy hour at pools for buy 1 get 2. Luckily, the staff did not care that we brought a cooler down, but we kept it hidden fairly well. went to 2 restaraunts there (resort prices). we drove to playa del carmen a few nights for dinner and there is lots to choose from!

We cannot say enough good things about The Grand Mayan.\u201d", "Author": "susanmaria", "ReviewID": "UR64167415", "Content": "When we arrived at the lobby, we were treated to stunning, soaring, thatched roof, open air lobby with a centerpiece Mayan statue, filled with Indian art that flowed to one of the most beautiful pools we have ever seen. Tropical alcoves, each with a slightly different feel, and even huge outdoor 'thatched' roof rooms with filtered shade - truly welcome in the blazing sun. Exceptional lounge furniture - different styles - more chairs than needed and even freshly sheeted BEDS are scattered around this pool for total luxury. I cannot imagine why people say the older 'Mayan Palace' pool is better - no way. The Grand Mayan pool is upscale and oozes class - while Mayan Palace pool is beautiful it is more family friendly but the pool itself is rather ordinary by comparison. Suites are perfect for two couples traveling together as the 2 bedroom has a 'neutral zone' consisting of kitchen, dining room, and living room - plus two separate master suites, one on each side. Total privacy - luxurious, marble & granite, ample towels, and even twice daily maid service. The Jungle that so many complain about is a superb location. The complainers had ME worrying about location - however there are NO bad locations on this property. Trams and vans circle entire resort constantly and there is no waiting for transportation. It takes a day or two to figure out the 'lay of the land' but after that its simple and staff was patient in helping us. I cannot imagine what the folks who complain about this resort have for comparison. All over the world at even the finest hotels, some rooms are oceanfront and some are not. They likely have never stayed at a luxury resort and been given the choice of jungle view for $450 a night or oceanfront at $3500 a night. If so, they would appreciate the jungle view. This is a RESORT with no oceanfront or ocean view suites - landscaping creates the atmosphere and view. Not a problem. The food at this resort is unbelievable! Resort food is usually adequate - but The Grand Mayan has restaurants that can stand up to the best in their class for food, atmosphere, and service. The buffet breakfast at Del Lago serves some of the most flavorful and authentic Mexican dishes I have ever tasted in my travels. This is not Taco Bell Mexican food! Pozole soup, chicken in mole sauce, hand made empanadas and tamales, fiery roasted and fresh salsas, freshly fried Churros tossed in cinnamon sugar to be dipped in your handmade pottery cup of steaming Mexican cocoa. This place is foodie heaven! Blue Fish served us fantastic fish tacos, ceviches, shrimp & crab burgers - gorgeous presentation. Tramontos was superb tender steaks and a fab wine list - at Gong we had Peking Duck carved tableside and served two ways - the best we have ever tasted. Is the food cheap? No. If you are looking for cheap food this is not the resort for you. If you dont mind paying a fair price for expertly prepared food, served with stunning presentation, exceptional service and atmosphere - you will love The Grand Mayan's selection of restaurants. SERVICE is beyond belief. The staff could not do enough for us. A friendly smile works wonders in any language - so dont be intimidated and please try a few words of Spanish. I have read many reviews stating drinks are high - again, this is a luxury resort and nothing is cheap. However drinks are less than one would pay in a comparable hotel or bar in the US. Daily happy hour is a great deal as ANY name brand is 2 for 1 - bartender happily created sugar free frozen cocktails minus the sugar syrup just for me. The gift shop and deli is a FANTASTIC convenience on property. Are prices higher? Absolutely! How wonderful though to be able to pick up a bottle of Redken hair conditioner, a Mexican Barbie doll with hand made clothes, some killer silver hoop earrings to wear to the Fiesta, plus a couple of mangoes and snacks to take to the condo without having to leave the property. If you wish to rent a car or take a bus to the local Walmart, more power to you. This resort group REALLY has their act together. I cannot even nit pick and think of anything for them to improve on. If you are well traveled and have enjoyed a variety of luxury resorts - you will also place The Grand Mayan firmly in your top finds.

Very interesting to see the iguanas, crocodiles and flamingos on the property also. The staff were all very friendly ... everyone you pass says, \"Hola!\" The pools were amazing. The main pool is the biggest I have ever seen. The special Grand Mayan pool has an artificial beach for the kiddies and an \"infinity pool\" effect leading to the lagoon. Plenty of shady areas in case the sun is beating down. The swim-up bars and 2-for-1 happy hours were great. We were in building 7 so it was a short walk to the Del Lago buffet and from there to one of the Grand Mayan pools. I can see if you were in one of the far-out buildings how it would feel like a challenge to get around. We had a double unit so the two teenagers had their own room, their folks (my sister and her husband) had a room and I slept on one of the comfy couches in the living area. We found the food at the restaurants good ... the buffet always has a huge selection. Enjoyed the free shows every night in the buffet and the dance bands at Havana Moon. The golf course was short and fun ... played 18 holes by myself in 2 hours and only put 2 balls in the water. We rented a car on the property in order to take a trip to Tulum and Playa del Carmen ... very convenient. Drawbacks are: - the beach is rocky just offshore making it impossible to swim in the ocean. - the tennis courts are carpet covered with a thin layer of sand ... very strange. Some of the carpet is coming loose around the edges. There is no organized instruction or player-match program. Tennis is one thing I really enjoy when I go to a resort so I missed out. - the mosquitoes were pretty bad! They attacked us one evening when we were eating at the cafe by the pool and they really attacked me on the golf course.

Fabulous resort, oversized units, spacious & well equipped. Write to conceige early and request a low numbered building (we got Bldg. No. 2) close to pools, store, activities and restaurants. They met every one of our requests. Staff is so accomodating, friendly and pleasant. They are prompt with special requests (i.e., beds are firm, request foam toppers). Bathrooms (shower/tub) are great, roomy. I would have to say that the housekeepers here are some of the sweetest/friendly ladies at any resort we've visited in Mexico. They were so gracious and friendly, they loved our grandchildren. We made a lot of our meals in the unit & had everything in the kitchen we needed to prepare them; however no ovens in the units, just stove/microwave cooking. Food at the pools and room service food was good. The restaurants at the resort are fairly \"pricey\" (buffets are $25 to $35). We did not do the Mexican Fiesta/Show ($60) so cannot give a review on that. The resort has a small grocery area; however best to go to Playa WalMart or Mega Mart. Grounds are beautiful. Resort sprays for mesquitos every day, we never had a problem with them. If you are out in the evenings, just take spray/wipes. There are many swimming pools, each with a different age/interest in mind. Loved the pools, tried most of them, however they are a bit shallow for adults, 4 ft. max; many baby areas within the pools, so everyone can enjoy being together. Palapa's are a great bonus, free if you drink and eat $35.00 at the pools/restaurants on that day. Don't forget to check your bill though because they will charge you if you don't ask for the reduction. Flamingos were beautiful and our grand children enjoyed seeing them. You cannot swim in the ocean here (good for beachcoming only), however Puerto Morales is wonderful and has sandy beaches and calm waters. John Gray's restaurant was a nice dinner \"find\" (upscale/small/intimate) in Puerto Morales (recommended by others on Trip Advisor). Good food at the beach restaurants in Puerto Morales too.

We thoroughly enjoyed the space and would go back. The resort is somewhat remote but I think that holds true for many of the resorts in the area. We had a car for the week and spent much of our time off the resort visiting Cozumel, Tulum , Puerto Morelos and Playa del Carmen, which would have been difficult and expensive without one as taxi\u2019s and tours are available but costly. We never ate in any of the restaurants but bought all of our food at the Mega Store, or a fruit stand or a fish market. The onsite store is very expensive. I\u2019d say 2 to 3 X\u2019s the cost of the Mega. I can\u2019t say if both bathrooms are the same but the one difference I noticed was that the room that looks as if it could be a single unit, no kitchen, has the Jacuzzi tub and offers a little more privacy with a sliding wall that blocks the tub off from the room.. The other bedroom does not have a Jacuzzi tub, it is a big bathtub though, and no wall to separate it from the rest of the room. There are separate shower areas and semi-private toilet areas. Each bedroom has a large flat screen TV, a sitting area and a king size bed which I found comfortable but some may say hard. The small but efficient kitchen had just about everything we needed. Our meals were not fancy, rice and beans or yucca and meat or fish that we or the mega store marinated and/or cooked. The Mega had a great selection of prepared foods. We spent one day in the Sanctuary area of the pool with floaties and drinks that we brought in a small soft-sided cooler and no one from the resort batted an eye. We never stayed at the beach and as everyone has said before it not all that inviting except perhaps to sit and watch the beauty of the sea itself. The morning that we left we had arranged for a hospitality room, as our flights were later in the afternoon. We spent the morning in the Grand Mayan pool on the best weather day of the trip. Why does that always happen? We had had a couple of days of torrential rain but being stuck in the beautiful, comfortable space with my friends, wine, beer, tequila and good food added up to a good time no less. However, a minor negative was having to rely on the shuttle because of the bad weather. I would not have had a problem walking from the lobby area to the room (building 12) in good weather but we had to wait for the shuttle after checking emails and it took 20 minutes which seems like an eternity when all the things listed above, oh and rum too, are waiting for you The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. The concierge checked us in for our flights the day before we left and printed out our boarding passes. He was also the one who suggested the hospitality room. One of the housekeepers and the gift shop clerk went way out of their way to find a bathrobe that one of us wanted to buy.

We stayed in Bldg 9 ( Jungle) which faced the jungle side of the resort - nice and quiet but a long but entertaining trek to the pool areas which were amazing. Lots of iguanas, lizards and birds on the winding pathways there. Taxis are a bit expensive so we pretty much stayed at the resort the entire week with the exception of taking the day trip to Chichen Itza. Pricey but worth it.

The grounds are manicured beautifully and the rooms are maintained extremely well. I was amazed by the resort\u2019s beauty when I first arrived. That feeling shortly dissolved when they tagged me like a dog by making all of their guests wear a designated wrist band. People who stay at the Grand Mayan Resort get red wrist bands while guests at the Mayan Palace get white ones. Certain areas of the resort are designated by the color of your wrist band. The resort is literally like a palace. The grounds are spread out so much that you will be doing a lot of walking to get from point A to point B. The average time to walk from my room to the pool was about 15 minutes one-way. I was staying in building 15. If your room is in buildings 1-5 consider yourself lucky. The resort does offer trams that will take you from building to building. However, the average wait time for one of these is about 20 minutes. Walking is probably your better option.. The one draw back about walking are the amount of mosquitoes that are present. I was literally covered with them walking a few steps outside. No problem though because the store located on the grounds carries all the necessities. Be prepared though to pay through the nose.. A little can of bug spray (that you will need) costs $10. To cheer myself up, I decided to get a (tiny) scoop of ice cream that cost me $5.50. Another draw back to this place is the lack of a usable beach. I was shocked to find this out. The resort is so contained that the closest town which is Playa del Carmen is about 20 minutes away by cab. Again, be prepared to pay through the nose for cab service. It costs about $20 dls one way from the resort to Playa del Carmen.. Other than the mosquitoes, no beach, the inconvenience of walking everywhere and costs, I would highly recommend this place. The food and service is impeccable. Del Lago\u2019s buffet and service was outstanding. My experience from a scale of 1-10 was about a 6. I would probably not go back.

Marble everything, stainless steel. Number one way to save money:USE THE PLAYA Express. The staff know this name and will tell you if you ask. All you do is go outside the main gates. If you stay on the side of the resort you can take it to Cancun and its 40 pesos, 45 min ride. if you cross the highway it takes you to Playa Del Carmen, 36 pesos 15 min ride. Its actually a mini van looking thing taht can hols apx 10-20ppl. Safe, clean and cheap. They stop and ask if you need a ride no need to wave them down. they usually have a sign in the window Play or Cancun. They can take you right to Walmart in Playa D.C. Go there and buy groceries the first night to save money on food(number 2 way to save). Spend for dinner. I dont recomend Havana Moon on the resport....beautiful but blah food. but there is plenty of other places with good food there. This place is amazing and I have tons of pictures and videos to prove this. Clean in the rooms, grounds, taxis, public transportation, bathrooms in Wal-mart, Clubs everywhere. Yea the roads are broken down and homes are old looking in town but this place is clean and even the crapiest place has A.C. A.C. is on everywhere, on high and all the time. No one tried to kidnap us or rob us. We left our safe open once and the maid called the front desk to have the room locked up, even from us! Dont know if someone else's experience will differ but for the week we stayed there, with my timeshare the greatness was consistent. Bed was kinda hard which other ppl have talked about in reviews, but its big clean and not that serious to us. The pool is better than any picture, therer are activities every night, some where they teach a dance, everyday there is a 45min bike tour, two for one drinks. All activities on site are free and fun. Some even include free drinks! We are in our twenties but there were ppl of all ages and races there, no drunks even when we went to La Brahma (which is free and all you can drink for ladies on Weds, 30 $ for men to get in and all you can drink in Playa Del Carme 12th street). The clubs have the best music and they do mini shows with dancing and circus type tricks that were not cheesy but dangerous-looking and fun. We did the excursion to Xel-ha. It was 99 dol a person and all you can eat (4 restaurants on premises) and all you can drink. Snorkeling gear is free and you get to keep your mouth piece with the tube. The place has manatees so close u can literally touch them. No staff is at this part. The snorkeling is fun. We wanted to do Tulum but said we just do the full day of Xel-ha bc otherwise you have olnyl 4 hrs and 2 hrs at Tulum. Place is 1 h4 from Grand Mayan but its goes fast with tour guide talking. We had to go to Cancun \"The City\" it was 45 dollars with open bar...SOOOO WORTH IT....GO its huge great dancing, great shows in between the dancing....all night 6-7am no fights no drama no crap just dancing. This resort is worth the trip, we shopped on 5th ave in Playa which was safe and fun. Food is cheap there and there is a beach.

If you are the type that want to stay in the resort this is a great option. Unfortunately that is not us... 5. We had a car, unfortunately the road into Playa is undergoing major rebuilding so the drives ended up being much longer than usual due to lane constriction and backups. Most days we went into Playa (for dinner, diving, shopping, Xplor, seeing the ruins, etc) and the drive back and forth due to the construction ended up costing us hours and hours of valuable vacation time. If you're going to do a lot when in Mexico I'd think twice about this resort until the road construction is finished. 6. Mosquitos...yes. Take spray. 7. Front desk and conceirge - really nice, helpful. 8. Restaurants...we ate at the Havana Moon several times. Pizza was not impressive in our opinion, it was soggy and not very flavorful. Bacon burger was great. Lo Mein was HUGE and the fried rice was decent, Club sandwich good. A lot more expensive than places in Playa. One night the live band was ok, the other night they were really good and we had a fun time dancing. Great atmosphere overlooking the water. 9. The pools...wow. Way beyond huge, clean, never crowded. 10. We booked the resort photographer to take beach pictures and were very happy with the result. Prices were about $30 per picture that you purchased with no sitting fee, pay nothing if you dont want any of the pics they take. 11. Grounds were beautiful 12. LONG walks if you aren't in buildings 1-5. There are on well paved trails but you are looking at about a 15 minute walk to get to the pools. If you want to sit by the pool all day it isn't a big deal, but if you want to go back to your room to take a nap or get a new book or just want to swim for a few minutes before heading to Playa then it does get sort of frustrating to have to walk a total of 30 minutes to get to the pools and back. 13. Be VERY VERY Careful when shopping at the Mega in Playa, which is where we went to buy groceries since we had a nice kitchen in our room. The Mega itself is nice and clean (especially compared to the Walmart) but our car was robbed while we where there. We got out of our car, put our backpacks IN THE TRUNK and when we came back they were gone. The police told us this is not an isolated incident....the bad guys watch you pull up and if you put things in the trunk or leave them in the car they casually come up to your car and pick the lock -- yes in the middle of a well lit parking lot that appears very safe -- and then casually take out your stuff. (it was suggested to us they pose as tourists and get stuff out of the car as if they own it and then casually walk away) We weren't the first ones this had happened to the police said. Mega has armed guards inside the store (like many big stores in Mexico) and the parking lot itself is very well lit. It's too bad they don't put one of the guards from inside the store outside in the parking lot....maybe would have saved us some headaches and lost cameras. 14. Beach is rocky for swimming, but we were warned of that. Not a big deal to us, there were tons of palapa's and beach chairs in the sandy area. Overall we really enjoyed the resort and didn't feel we got something we werent expecting due to the other reviews here on TripAdvisor. However between the walks to and from the pool and the construction and drives into Playa we did spend a lot of valuable vacation time getting to and from places we wanted to go which was a bummer. But wow a beautiful, clean resort that we'd recommend for those who want to stay there, hopefully our pictures capture the true beauty.", "Date": "April 25, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hawthorne, NJ", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Resort\u201d", "Author": "macgruder", "ReviewID": "UR62257527", "Content": "We stayed here for a week in April, what a beautiful place.

This trip was a timeshare swap. Only bad deal was that RCI could not match our 2 bedroom, so we took the one bedroom. We went during a spring break week. Will break this review down as it applied to my family. The resort is beautiful. Our room was in the Grand Mayan Jungle, building 12 out of 13. We had a nice view of the golf course. It is true that the Jungle is some distance from the pools and restaurants, but there are shuttles about every 10-12 minutes. Once you get the lay of the land, you will find there are some shortcuts and a brisk walk gets you where you want to go in about 10-15 minutes. The lower the building number the closer you are to the pools and restaurants. The room was very spacious. The living area comfortably slept the other two people of our party with pull out beds from under the couches. Whatever other people say, my wife and I thought the bed in our room was great, not to hard and not to soft. Small kitchen with mini fridge, stove, and microwave served our purposes. Left $5 a day for the maid when we allowed her in. Room didn't always need to be spruced up. The chambermaid we allowed in at most twice. She would want to either prepare beds or pick up trash. The pools are wonderful. There is a huge pool for Grand Mayan guests only and a much larger pool for guests of the Grand Mayan and Mayan Palace. There is also a smaller, but still big, pool that has a sandy beach. Never had a problem finding a place to lie down in at least one of the pools. You can be waited on hand and foot at all of the pools. This resort does not have the nice sandy beach of other resorts, but there are other places to take care of that. The restaurant food was great. None of us had anything we wouldn't get again. Room service food was also great. Also the deli in the resort store had excellent sandwiches and side items. There are only two unique tennis courts located at the top of a building. The courts are artificial grass carpet with sand on them. The baselines are a little torn up. If you are playing tennis expect some bad bounces. Tennis is free, but it seemed to be first come, first serve. There is a book to sign at the courts for trying to arrange matches with other guests. Played golf one day. It is a par 3 course. The price, around $70, includes clubs, left and right, and cart. Long tees are in the cart, but I used mostly broken tees as it is a par 3 course. Balls are extra. We booked, through the resort, a Swim with the Dolphins trip which was at Delphinus. It was fantastic. The cost of the trip is the same as if you book through Delphinus. This is true of most any of the trips to one of the attractions. Convenient pick up and drop off at resort. The resort does run an account for you. At sign in, you put $800 pesos into your account. You give your room number and sign for anything purchased on the resort. I kept track and at checkout found their numbers to be like mine except for a daily charge they included. Expect to go over the $800 especially if you book attractions through the resort. On our own, we booked our own zip line and cenote trip with Boca del Puma in Puerto Morelos. As the resort doesn't let everyone in, we walked to the front gate of the resort and got picked up although they did drop us off upon returning in front of our building. This was a nice attraction about a half hour away from the resort. One of our reasons for going was to scuba dive. There is a dive facility on the resort beach. They do one tank dives for $50 just out from the resorts shore line. I booked dives ahead of time with \"Dive in Puerto Morelos\" which is about a 12 minute drive. The concierge will set up a taxi for you, but I walked to the front gate one day and caught a taxi outside the front gate. Taxis were abundant in Puerto Morelos and I had no fear of not being able to get back to the resort. Taxis one way are about $15-20 pesos. Although I didn't try any, there are other ways to get places, such as collectivo buses. The dive shop was one block from the water. $70 for two tank dives, equipment included. Would dive with the outfit again. There is a shuttle that takes guests from the resort to Playa del Carmen. The cost is $4 one way. There is a schedule and a place to board the shuttles at the resort. It takes about 25 minutes to get there, but there is a convenient drop off place which allows you to hit \"5th Avenue\" or Walmart. You could make a day of going to the beach and shopping/eating in Playa. The key to having a great time is relax and be patient. We didn't try to fill our days with outside the resort activities and chose to enjoy the resort more.

We were there for six days and had two, two bedroom suites. We traded through RCI and were told we would be in the jungle buildings, but because my family is also Grand Mayan owners, they were able to put us in building four. The lower the building number, the closer you are to the main resort. Building four was a good location- just a short walk to the Grand Mayan pools and main shops at the Mayan Palace. We had a rental car and drove to the store on our first day to buy groceries. We couldn't find Walmart and ended up stopping at a normal grocery store. if you plan to go to Walmart, get good directions before you go!! The Grand Mayan has a couple of pools that are supposed to be for Grand Mayan only and then the Mayan Palace has about eight pools. Most of our time was spent at the Grand Mayan pool with the \"beach\" entry. The depth of the pool was very nice for my three year old nephew to hang out in. A couple of things to point out about the pools... there are several restaurants throughout the resort and several of the pools had different menus for poolside service (as did the beach). The food we liked, wasn't available at the Grand Mayan pools so when it was time to eat, we would go down to the beach and order there. However, in doing so, we would lose our spot by the pool. (NOTE: People get up VERY early and put towels on the chairs/cabanas to \"save\" making it difficult to get good chairs if you went down after 10). The pools were amazing, but after visiting the Grand Mayan at Nuevo Vallarta and Acapulco, they were disappointing because they are just pools (no lazy river, water slides, etc). Lots of people complain about the beach, but we didn't have any issues (as we don't like to swim in the ocean). There were more than enough chairs on the beach and plenty of covered areas. We found spots next to the water multiple days to build sandcastles and just hang out. It was perfect for what we wanted (and very calm for kids as the waves are limited). The staff was amazing- we participated in several adult and kids crafts and also in their cocktail making lesson. They were all very well organized and entertaining. We went to the main restaurant (the Lago) for the Italian dinner buffet and ancient Mayan show. The food was good and the show was interesting. It was nice to do before visiting Chichen Itza, Tulum and Coba as we were able to get a better understanding of the Mayan culture. My only true complaint about the resort was that they allowed smoking almost everywhere.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Deephaven", "Title": "\u201cAmazing vacation-- loved the Grand Mayan\u201d", "Author": "missymalloo", "ReviewID": "UR61263148", "Content": "We had a fabulous vacation at the Grand Mayan. We liked the fact that it was not an all inclusive since we are not drinkers and didn't want to pay $100 per person per day and we wanted the flexibility to explore other areas without being tied to our resort. We traded in with RCI and stayed in building 6. We did request to be put in one of the buildings closer to the pool and this paid off because it was still a decent walk every day as it is a large resort. We had two large rooms with king size beds, two bathrooms, a living room and a kitchen. The beds were firm as other people have noted and even with an egg crate pad they were still firm in my opinion. That was probably the worst part-- I didn't think the beds were super comfortable. However the palapas beds by the pool were very comfortable. We didn't have to pay for them on the Grand Mayan side. I think that on the Mayan palace side they seemed to regulate that more. My husband just went down early on his morning run and put our stuff down by 7am and we had a nice pool bed area saved. It was great to read and relax and still watch our two girls swim to their hearts' delight. We also have two teenage boys that had a great time. Our apartment could have honestly accomodated 12 people. It was very spacious and there were 6 of us. There was maid service twice a day and it was so nice for them to come and set up the girls' beds every night and leave chocolates on our pillows. We did snorkeling at Puerto Morales (10 minutes away). The snorkeling cost us around 25 USD a piece with the boat ride for a two hour tour. We had a great time with Charlie Brown our guide. He took great care with the little ones. We had another family with so there were 4 kids from 6 to 10 years plus the 4 adults and 2 teenagers. We ate in an amazing hole in the wall called Piccolinas. You have to try it. Also souveniers were cheaper here than other places. We went on a tour with Edventures Tour with Manny who was AWESOME! He took us ziplining, and on a snorkling tour in a cave, with the sea turtles and in a lagoon. We also ate at a delicious spot called Buena Vida. Highly recommend it. We also went on a private tour of the ruins with Helaman tours with Carlos. We saw Chichen Itza and Ek Balaam. It was another fantastic day. He also took us to a cenote to swim which we needed because it was so hot at the ruins. This was also a great day. I would highly recommend this company-- we saw other large tour buses pull in and it was so great to have our personal guide. He has his degree in archaeology and tailored the tour to our family. We went into Playa one night and didn't love it as it was so touristy. We did cook some at the resort but it is a small kitchen. Do note that there is not an oven. It worked well for breakfast mainly. We did try Havana Moon at the resort. Not very good and pricey. We also tried Blue Fish which was better but the SLOWEST service ever. Do yourself a favor and order from the pool-- they seem to cater to their poolside orders over the people sitting in the restaurant. Your tip is factored in either way so you might as well swim or read a book while you wait for your food. I would definitely recoomend Del Lago for the Seafood Buffet (Friday night) and for their breakfast. The breakfast is pricy 20$ USD per person but it is actually worth it. Eat a later brunch and it will count for two meals. Both the seafood and the breakfast buffets were absolutely amazing. If I were to do it differently I may have come back another time here and skipped the Havanna Moon and Blue Fish. Honestly, I don't think we paid that much more for Del Lago and it was way better and you could have all you wanted to eat. Also kids were free with a paying adult and they had a show to go with it. We would definitely go back. As noted the beach was rocky but we didn't miss it much since we snorkeled a lot other places and enjoyed the pools.", "Date": "April 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "chicago", "Title": "\u201cGrand Mayan staff hussels\u201d", "Author": "DianeDugan", "ReviewID": "UR60847966", "Content": "We had a wonderful time at this resort.

We had one week in a two bedroom, two batch unit. This year we were up on the third floor. The place is pretty quiet after 11pm. The beds are comfy, on the very firm side. Showers are good, with plenty of hot water. It seems that hot water is not an issue here. The rooms are very clean and kept that way. The staff is pretty helpful. I played golf and enjoyed it. Even though it is a par 3 course, it is very tricky and has some difficult holes. This year you have to buy your used balls in addition to your greens fees. The area is divided into two sections, the Mayan Palace and the Grand Mayan. Grand Mayan peope can go and lounge wherever they like. Mayan Palace folks are limited to the big pool area. The Grand pool area that is restricted is smaller and more private with several different very nice pool areas. We heard that the you can no longer buy breakfast anymore, you have to get the buffet at the Del Lago or Green Break. It is actually a very good buffet at Del Lago, well worth it but I don't eat like that every day. We went into Playa del Carmen (200 pesos) on the first full day there and stocked up on food and beverages for our stay. We also ate twice at Balche for dinner and once at Green Break (19th hole at the golf course). Everyone enjoyed their food except for the Tlayuda (kind of a thin Mexican pizza). They were both cold when the made it to the table. I had the enchiladas and really enjoyed them. We also ate in town at Playa del Carmen a couple of times and had good food there. Also, the town has a popular nightlife if you are up for the late night partying which ends at about 4am. Last year we had a bad experience at the sales presentation and I wrote about it here. In short, it was a very hostile experience. This year they said they are under new management (the sales team) and it would only be 90 minutes and no pressure. 3-1/2 hours and people later it was only a bit better than last year. You start with a free breakfast buffet with your first sales host. I almost left there when I rose to go the the bathroom and the sales hostess said I should wait and we good all go together at the end of the meal. I went anyway. She generally was very nice but she gave me the feeling of a grade school teacher who you don't want to make angry. She took us to the presentation room and gave up pretty quickly. We then went through 4 more sales people. One of them wondered out loud how we had been \"allowed\" to come to the Grand Mayan again, not being owners. He said it would not happen again! We are Hilton owners and we can attend anytime at any Mayan resort. Anyway, the sales presentation really is a pain in the neck. I would not do it again. No, we did not buy. They really pushed to get us to trade our Hilton property, but no way we are doing that. After talking with other people it seems the Mayan is upgrading and want their owners to up grade their memberships in order to qualify in the future for what they thought they already purchased.

The rooms are very nice. However since we were trading through HSI, exchange rooms are on the jungle side which since we were on the highest level #3, the mosquitoes were minimal, but there are definitely mosquitoes! Being on the 3rd floor gave us a panoramic view over the jungle. It was quite pretty, but I wouldn't have wanted to be on the lower floors jungle side looking only straight at the jungle. We were also put in the farthest Grand Mayan building from the pools and restaurants and since this is a huge resort, it was quite a walk. The walking I didn't mind, but one really had to plan it into the sch since it took 15-20 minutes to walk one-way. So when you hear the resort is too big- it just encompasses so much land area that if you get put into a farther building be ready to walk! Plus the rooms echo whatever is going on in the hallways at night, so you can hear people coming back to their rooms at night. The only other thing about the resort is if you are taking older children 18+, it is quite a taxi jaunt to get to either Playa (25 min), Cancun (35 minutes). There really is not much life in the evening at the hotel, so the distance does create a problem for night life or even getting groceries. If you don't need too many groceries just stay on sight at the boutique grocery- it really isn't that expensive and you have to consider a ride to Mega Mart (which locals recommend over the Playa del Carman Walmart) is $20 US dollars one way...... The buffet at the Mayan Riviera is very good, even the nightly shows are pretty good. It is not cheap, but the food is very good! The only night I wouldn't go to the buffet is the Mexican Fiesta night. Drinks are includes in the buffet that night for about twice the cost of the other evening buffets. That night the food was average, but nothing great and the lines do not move well, but if you have never been to a Mexican Fiesta the show is fun. Just don't plan on anything too special for the dinner. It runs about $58 US dollars per person. And word of warning- DO NOT eat at the Asian Restaurant on site called \"Gong\". Not worth your time or $! Again this resort is kept up very, very well and all the employees were very kind. The resort is beautiful! The pools are exquisite, but don't plan on anything too special on the beach. There were a lot of bugs on the beach and not a very good swimming beach at all- reefs uncovered from the hurricane and lots of rocks. Nonetheless, it you like pools, this one has many!

Excellent Gym, a lot of equipment, plus treadmills, EFX Eliptical machines and spinning classes. Lots of machines and free weights. Key is to go in later afternoon, you can have the gym to yourself. The locker rooms are very clean along with the sauna's. Very Tranquill. Restaurants are good, Italien one is the best, call early for a reservation.

My wife and I are grand mayan owners and are happy there. We do have questions for other owners who attended the time share presentations. We were very close to upgrading to the Villa. We currently have 2 registered weeks and 2 vacation fair weeks. The offer was $27K to upgrade to 3 Villa weeks that included 16 weeks of free golf per week plus 2 spa treatments per week. The hook was that there were no more maintenance fees (approx $900/wk). Today, we pay for two registered weeks per year even if they go unused. With two 4 yr olds we have not used them in the last few years.

Our stay in the Riviera Maya was everything we've come to expect from this chain of Mexican resorts. Previous reviews (especially the most recent) clearly explain what a great resort this is. However, we won't be returning... Why? The poor condition of the beach. No one ever talks about this, but for us, the beach is a key element of any stay at a Grupo Mayan resort. We did read how rocky the beach was before we left but still thought if we brought our beach shoes with us we could walk a few miles on the shore. We tried but it was not very relaxing. Also the color of the water was not at all as beautiful as the near by beaches we visited daily. Just a 10 minute ride up North to Puerto Morelos we found not only spectacular white sand and various colors of turquoise water but there was snorkeling right from shore. There are boats that for $25 a person they will take you to two different localities for snorkeling but now that the town put in holding ropes and buoys the locals and the tourists can swim safely to one of the reefs. There are many restaurants to eat in all around this small town. One of the restaurants we had a good lunch in was called John Gray's Mother in Law located to the left of the pier. We also found a good luncheon place right on the shore south of Tulum called Vita e Bella. One can walk from there up the beach to the Tulum ruins. We did stay in building ten facing the jungle on the ground floor. Not much to look at and the mosquitoes and black fleas were out early morning and at dusk. Luckily we brought spray with us but I would request a higher room as this may not have as many insects. There was check out in our building so we did not have to go to the main lobby for checking out. Since we do not like to sit around a pool at any of the resorts but would rather explore we rented a car with Alamo for the week. With the mandatory insurance the rental came to $286.

You can request CRIBS and high chairs to use while you are at this resort. The cribs are about 2/3 the size of a regular crib, wooden railings with a thick foam mattress. The high chars are plastic with seat belts. They are both complimentary. 2. The POOLS can be cold for young children. We found the best place for families at the main Mayan pool is by the snake sculpture. It has a large shallow area and feels warmer than other areas. There is also a new \"sandy\" pool beside the Grand Mayan pool. My kids spent hours playing in the sand here. TIP:buy your beach toys at home, the hotel boutique and even local Walmart do not have a great selection of beach toys. 3. SLIPPERY- From the marble in the suites to the tiles beside the pools, many surfaces are extremely slippery, especially when wet. My poor kids bit it several times. 4. Palapas- These are fantastic for families. Our kids napped beside the pool and they provided shade when it got too hot. They are first come - first serve at the Grand Mayan pool and $35/day, and by reservation at the main pool ( you get this free, if you spend $35 in drinks and food). 5. Buy sunscreen at home it was so much money here, even at the Mega $23 ! 6. Schedule time with the on site photographer, they were all great to deal with, ours was Charlie. We did a shoot down by the beach, no cost for the photo session and the photos range from $30- $25 each depending on how many you buy. No pressure, and we have some amazing photos from our vacation. You get them on a CD so it is up to you to print them when you get home, but I prefer this, because you can use them for Xmas cards, print multiples, etc. 7.The on site shuttles are great, but they do not accommodate strollers, so be prepared to walk if you want these down by the pool. 8. There are flamingos and crocodiles on site. They feed the the crocs once a week, ask the concierge if you are interested in viewing this. ( I think it is Thurs at noon). 9. I would also recommend buying your baby food at home. My son eats rice cereal before bed, but the only ones I could find were so sweet with a ton of sugar in them. My sister also found this with their brands of infant formula. 10. My final tip in involves traveling. The best purchase we made for this trip was called a Babyz Go Go travelmate. It is a small carrier that coverts your car seat into a stroller. With three children this was a life saver in the airport! I will also mention that with children renting a car is a must. Shuttles and buses do not accommodate your kids car seats and then when you get to your destination what do you do with it? And for those who think that they are Mexico so why bother with the car seat, why do you think that your child is less like to be injured in a \"Mexican\" accident?

The staff was wonderful; the grounds had scarcely a blade of grass out of place, the ample drinks during happy hour could easily derail your day if you aren't careful, the space took itself very seriously but still allowed for fun (so many fake mayan heads! hilarious), and provided plenty of room to roam about. My wife and I are Hilton people but with Hiltons all booked, we were directed to this RCI resort and it did not disappoint. The location is great as you are close to most everything - we drove to a number of places such as Playa del Carmen, Puerto Moreles, Coba, Tulum, and Cancun (city center). And being only 15 minutes from Playa del Carmen, we could go there for lunch or dinner. We did not subject ourselves to the timeshare presentation and I'm glad we didn't. Having talked with other guests that did, it proved to be a long, exhausting day and not worth a free buffet breakfast and whatever else they waved under your nose. Things that would have made it better: a hot tub of some sort (though heating acres of water probably has negative environmental consequences); more jogging paths (though there were ample paths, these were generally filled with people walking around, as they should be. but jogging was prohibited on the access roads and golf cart paths so it was a challenge); and better sound proofing between rooms (all of these places have doors between the rooms to create giant suites but let sound in like crazy. but living in the city, i'm used to hearing everything from everyone anyway though one hates to use earplugs on vacation.) But these were small things that did not diminish my enjoyment of the place. One thing - don't rent a car from EuropeCar because they totally ripped us off for a scratch on the bumper caused by a rock on the highway. This is generally regarded as acceptable wear and tear on the car but not in Mexico. I would rent a car directly from the good folks at the Grand Mayan instead, as they have plenty of cars on the property.

The resort itself it gorgeous. The rooms are fantastic. We stayed in a one bedroom unit with a plunge pool on the patio. If it hadn't been for my recent foot surgery they were going to put us in building 13. Instead they put us in a handicapped room in building 3. Apparently anyone that trades RCI and comes to the Grand Mayan gets put in the Jungle buildings. We loved most everything about the hotel - but had a few complaints. The pools were cold. REALLY cold. Too cold to swim in. The beach is essentially unusable. The food was extra salty (we assume to get you to drink) and some of the staff were very rude. The first night we got there we ate at Tramonto and it was fantastic. Reasonably priced and nice selection. We aren't drinkers however and I found it quite funny when the Sommolier came over to introduce himself and we explained that we didn't drink. He said \"Let me know if you change your mind...\" The next day we took a shuttle from the hotel into Playa Del Carmen ($40 pesos) and ended up on the ferry to Cozumel. We took a Discover Scuba lesson and ended up scuba diving in Cozumel. It was stunning. We stopped at the WalMart on the way back to the resort. Tip: DON'T go to the Walmart. It is dirty and gross and the lines are long. Instead, go three blocks north to the Mega. Much better selection and prices. Monday we hung around the resort and got a little stir crazy around 2. The pools were too cold to swim in and we were bored. So we took the shuttle back into Playa for some dinner. It was a nice distraction. Tuesday we went on a scheduled tour to Chichen Itza. I highly recommend booking through Cancun Discounts dot com. They have amazing tours at great prices. This was a fantastic day. Wednesday we went on a dolphin swim. We went through Dolphin Discovery and while the time with the dolphins was nice - they wouldn't let us take our own photos. Then at the end they hit us up for $100US for the video and pictures. Or we could purchase the pictures for $20US each. I did not enjoy being gouged at the end and it ruined the experience for us. Thursday was another tour that we had booked through Cancun Discounts (and was hosted by AllTourNative Tours). They picked us up at our hotel and were driven to a Mayan Village. We went on three ziplines, rode mountain bikes, got a blessing from a Mayan Shaman, snorkled and swam in a cenote and had lunch. Then we went out to Tulum for the afternoon. It was a lovely day. Some tips about the resort itself: - We had no problem getting out of the timeshare presentation. They weren't pushy at all. Just be straight with them. - If you like the Tramonto make reservations for every night right away. We tried to make reservations on Thursday morning for Thursday night and they only had availability at 9:00pm. Even though we walked by and they had a bunch of tables sitting empty at 7pm. - The tacos at TacosBreak are awesome. They could stand to put some patio heaters out there though - it was really cold at night! - Ask for an egg crate for your bed. They are really firm! - Eat at the Blue Lobster in Playa - it is fantastic! We had our best meal there. - Go out to Cozumel at least once. It is stunning - and much more small town. - The resort seems to be geared more towards older folks. If you are young and looking for a great Spring Break experience this is not the place for you. (Which is fine with us because we are an old married couple). - Buy anything you need in town because the grocery on site upcharges about 200% for everything. All in all it was a lovely trip. We are very glad we left our four children at home - it would have been a miserable trip with them. We much prefer the small town feel of Cabo to Cancun and we won't be returning.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee, WI", "Title": "\u201clove it, but have a few issues\u201d", "Author": "nancylandre", "ReviewID": "UR57836884", "Content": "This hotel complex is beautiful and the rooms are over the top luxe, and despite what others say, i LOVE the beds. They're extremely high quality and firm, with nice pillows and bedding. Honestly, we've exchanged into this place for the last 3 years, and have always been happy with it. It's particularly great if you have kids, as the Kid's Center and Entertainment staff (the cocktail lessons are a riot! ) are unbelievably fun, talented, and genuine. The food at the restaurants is also much better than typical hotels, and reasonably priced, and the service is impeccable. My only complaints are that the pools aren't warm enough. I never went in this year and my husband and kids, who normally have a much higher tolerance than I, were reluctant to go in unless we had full direct sun, and even then, the initial plunge was a bit shocking. The other thing is, there is no dvd or vcr player in the rooms, which is weird, cuz they have all these other amenities that seem excessive, like the individual private balcony pools and phones in the bathroom. Also, no wi fi anywhere. Finally, although we don't really care about this, half of the grand mayan rooms are REALLY far from the pools and beach, so much so that you have to take a shuttle. Our kids love the shuttle and my husband i love to walk, but it's a good 15 minute brisk walk to the pools from the rooms by the golf course. Finally, it's at least a 20 minute drive to town and the beach is not swimmable, so if you want to be closer to the action or swim in the ocean, this isn't your best option. If you have youngish kids and just want to hang out and enjoy the sun and nice accomodations, it's a mostly great place, though. We'll probably go back next year. One last thing, we always avoid the timeshare presentation, and they give you a really hard time about this. One year a saleswoman told us that if we didn't do it, we couldn't come back again (on an exchange), which isn't true. Having to deal with them right after you check in is a most unwelcome hassle, as they're really aggressive. The check-in process is unnecessarily slow as well.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "merritt island, florida", "Title": "\u201cMyth's, truths, tips and only a few warnings...\u201d", "Author": "nautifish", "ReviewID": "UR57727826", "Content": "We arrived at the airport 2 hours late on Saturday due to airline flight delay. Fortunately the shuttle was available and did not have to worry. Concierge later told us they are running shuttles all the time, so no worries if your flight is late. Tip: Be sure to walk straight through and outside after picking up your luggage and going through customs if you are taking the comlimentary shuttle. Many scammers will try to pull you aside and tell you they are from the resort. ONLY look for the guys with NAVY Blue slacks and the beige polo shirt with the Mayan resort logo embroidered on thier shirts as stated in the confirmation letter. The scammers will only have mutiple badges hanging from their necks that are fake. Confirmation letter does not tell you where the shuttles are. I will: As you walk out the door keep walking straight and across the driveway to the shuttles waiting on the other side. Do not let anyone tell you to go left, as that is where you will find even more scammers being held back behind a gate. Our shuttle driver had a clipboard with our information on it. When we arrived at 3 pm, we knew we were 2 hours early for check in, as naturally our room was not ready. We were able to securely store our luggage with the bellman, and then were given a 25% discount for lunch at Blue Fish, which is just outside the lobby and to the left at the beautiful Mayan Palace Pool (they have two, one is \"inside the protected area, and the other is outside as a \"beach style pool\"). After politely, but firmly refusing the man that approached us for the \"tour\" just after check in, we were only bothered again later in the week with a phone call, and after giving him the same firm and polite no thank you, we were not bothered again. Our waiter at Blue Fish, George (the older, taller one as thier are two), was fantastic. We returned many times during the week for lunch to ask for him. Natchos and the margaritas were the best I have ever had. Tip: Some reviewers have stated there is very little liquor in the drinks. Yes there is liquor, but some are more mild and many others will kick your butt.... It is all in the free pour and what bartender you get at the time. Lunch was a wonderful relaxing start to our stay there. The time went by fast and when we finished, our room was ready and we were escorted by our guide in his luggage golf cart to our room. Tip: I had emailed 2 weeks early to ask for buildings 1-7 as recommended on these reviews. They could not accomodate, but were able to put us in building nine. I think almost all RCI exchanges get \"the jungle\". I did, however, receive my request for a 3rd floor room, as I knew that would be a top floor room and would not have to listen to people on the floor above us. I asked for a quiet room, and was pleased that they put us in our 2 bedroom grand suite at the end of the building that had less hallway foot traffic. There was no unit behind our master bedroom wall, thus no one to listen to on the other side of the wall at night. 2nd related tip: A previous reviewer recommended the \"jungle side\" and said those rooms are the odd numbered rooms. I noticed our number as being such, and asked at check in if we were indeed facing the jungle. The young, obviously new, clerk called someone and told us we were indeed facing the jungle. That did not end up being true, as we were facing the golf course and the end of the parking lot. Was not a problem, but you will hear not only many carts on the \"cart\" path, but also trucks, vans and cars at all hours of the night. Warning: Would be much more of an issue on the bottom floor. Myth: The jungle is too far from anything. Truth: Our building nine was hardly any further than the other circles of buidings in the desired 1-7 building area. I could see building 13 (the last one) having to be a little far, but still not that bad. The only shuttles we took all week were the check in and check out baggage shuttles. Even on the rainy days we walked, and we walked a lot. We walked early in the morning with coffee mugs in hand to watch the sunrise at the beach (the furthest part of the resort from our unit). We walked later to the cyber cafe. We walked again to use the pool and go to lunch. We walked later in the afternoon just to enjoy the lush tropical landscaping along the beautiful paths (the most lush are in the interior area of buildings 1-7). We walked to dinner each night. Tip: I am 55 years old, out of shape, and overweight and did not have any problems. I recommend everyone, that is not physically disabled, enjoy the pleasures of those walks. (For us it was a good idea with all those wonderful cocktails and the rich foods.) Who needs to pay to use the gym?? We saw the most beautiful birds (especially along the jungle side of our location) and unusual creatures. Our walking tours were the highlight of our stay. There are crocodiles (in a pen), near buildings 4-7, and flamingos near buildings 1-3. Myth: You need a car for the whole stay. Truth: You can save money on partial use through the week. Tip: We knew we did not need the car the first day at check in, so we picked one up the next morning for Sunday and Monday from the Alamo desk at the Palace lobby. It was the same price as one from the airport, and a much much more relaxing experience. We used the car to get groceries and liquor in town, then for a trip to Tulum on Monday. Turned the car back in to enjoy the resort on Tuesday and Wednesday, and then rented one again for Thursday and Friday. Car was approx 40.00 a day. Even paying for the 15.00 a person return shuttle, we saved money on not having the car for the whole week. The shuttle transfer to the airport was so much easier, as the airport can be a zoo. Myth: You have to go to Walmart for groceries and liquor. Truth: We indeed went to Walmart for the first supply trip, but found it crowded and unorganized. The aisles are jammed and some of the people, both employees and customers can be rude. Tip: On the second trip, we found Mega Mart on the corner of Juarez and Calle 30, which is about 4-5 blocks South of Walmart. That store was a joy with the much better selection, cleaner, organized and less crowded. The prices were the same. 2nd related tip: A bottle of wine is 3 times the price of a bottle of liquor, both at the resort and in the stores. We enjoyed our purchased cocktails every afternoon on our beautiful large balcony. My simple mix was rum, pineapple juice (sold in \"juice box\" on the shelves\") and orange juice bought from Mega foods. Myth: mosquitos. Truth: We saw 2 during our whole stay. Myth: Owners wear \"gold\" wristbands. Truth: They do not issue the gold bands anymore, thus unlike someone stated previously, there is no discrimination with those of us on an exchange with red wrist bands. Palace guests use cream colored writbands, and Grand Mayan guests use red ones. They DO check and look at your wrist if you enter the Grand Mayan areas without that red band. Our young check in clerk forgot to give us our red bands and we had to return for them. Tip: Massive construction going on in Playa Del Carmen on the main highway, so take care when driving through, especially if you are looking for street signs that seem to be missing as you travel South. They are on the East side and hard to see from that route. We went to Tulum on Monday. Been there, done that. Enjoyed the resort more. Tip: If you go, it is about an hour and a half south. When you get there, you will pay a small price to park in one of the private parking lots. Then it is a very long walk (even if you are on a tour bus) just to get to the ruins and another long walk around the park. The people we saw in the long walking lines looked miserable. It was hot, and if you did not bring water, very thirsty. Suggest to go early in the morning before the sun is high. Don't bother dragging along snorkle gear, as it is a very small beach and was very rough seas when we were there. If you do decide to swim, wear your bathing suit under your clothes, as there are no changing rooms in the park. Wear comfortable walking shoes...you will need it. We had lunch at the recommended La Buena Vida in Aukumal. I am guessing this place has had better days in the past. Tip: If you can't get one of the 4-5 tables that are right out over the beach, you may not like what you smell. We had a table just one back from those desired tables and smelled urine the whole time. My guess is the locals and the drunken tourists are \"spraying\" the seawall instead of using the restrooms. Our food was horrible. We had the fish tacos, which were smelled fishy and tasted bad. Margaritas were very weak, and the service was slow. Place was full of those loud drunken tourists. We had all of our dinners at the resort and did not have a single bad meal. The food was great, especially one night at Havana Moon when we were lucky enough to enjoy a great table by the window with the ocean breeze and a terrific band playing for fun after dinner dancing. Tip: We enoyed the Del Lago show and buffet on Monday and had made reservations for the Thursday fiesta. Monday show was better, food was better, and half the price of the Thursday show. Related tip: If do go, and spend the 60.00 a person on Thursday, get there way before the 6pm opening time. We arrived at 6:05 and had to stand in a huge line just to get in which wrapped along the dark walkway for blocks. They did have a nice touch, bringing platters of margaritas to the waiting throng. They were great. This, however, was when we met the 2 mosquitos. Ouch. Wear a long sundress or slacks or use your spray. The only complaints I had were few: For some reason the water pipes in the wall start to bang about 1:00 am, and continue till morning. I am guessing it was expanding and contracting due to temperature extremes. If you get up early for a shower, expect the water to be almost warm. I think they turn the water heaters off during the night. Could explain the pipes. Would have liked to stay on the jungle side of \"the jungle\" for the bird watching and to avoid the \"I-95\" highway of the cart path at all hours. Overall, I thought the resort was beautiful, the room spacious and comfortable, and the service was enough to spoil us.

After my husband returned from serving in Iraq we were ready for a quiet, warm getaway. My husband called ahead and told them the reasons for our travel and we were surprised to walk in to our room and see they had given us the \u201choneymooners\u201d welcome (towel swans, rose petals, freshly drawn bath, etc.). They took care in the little things. The resort is big, but since we were coming to relax it was nice to feel like there was no need to leave the resort if we didn\u2019t want to. There was always a new restaurant or pool to explore. We spent most of our time at the Grand Mayan pools. These pools are a little quieter than then main Mayan Palace pool. Granted we were in building 5 so our room might have been a bit closer than others, but we didn\u2019t think there was too much walking at all. We are in our late 20s and we always chose to walk rather than take the shuttle. As a side note, if you are someone who likes to watch TV on vacation, just a little warning that most of the channels are in Spanish. There are some news channels and movie channels (HBO, MGM, etc) in English - but that\u2019s about it. I was a little bummed to miss so much of the Olympics. We bought groceries in Playa del Carmen and we very much enjoyed eating breakfast and some lunches in the privacy of our own room (we had the one bedroom suite which has a fridge, coffee maker, stove top, and microwave). I highly recommend the restaurant in the spa/gym. Great, healthy options. There are also different spa deals every day so you can check to see if some of the services you would be interested in are on special. I got a free manicure with the purchase of a pedicure. Some comments based on reviews I read before traveling: \u2022 The beds are indeed hard. Ask for an egg crate, which helps a little bit. \u2022 We were fortunate to not have anyone on either side of our room for the first 5 days. The last two days there was a group that moved in next door and the walls are in fact very thin. \u2022 The weather is very humid but we had no problems with mosquitoes as some mentioned in previous reviews. They fumigate daily. Most everyone speaks English well but there were a couple of times when the language barrier was difficult. That is to be expected when traveling to a different country. We really enjoyed using the little Spanish we knew from our college days. If there was any part that was a little disappointing about our trip I would say it was the way we observed some fellow Americans talking about and treating the staff. The staff were amazing and didn\u2019t deserve some of the snotty comments we overheard. I was embarrassed by the lack of respect and a sense of entitlement that many exhibited.

The Grand Mayan private pools were much more relaxing. If you are looking for a beach experience, this is not the place. You could not enter the water from the beach.

The resort is very spread out and if you don't mind walking from place to place, as opposed to waiting for the shuttles, it wasn't too bad. Wished they had some type of bikes you could use to get around. That would have been great. The shuttles in the evening were hard to come by and at one point we waited for almost 25 minutes.

We enjoyed taking the shuttle to Playa Del Carmen several times while staying at the Grand Mayan. The cost was 40 pecos per person. We were able to meet a lot of people from several countries and all of the guest were helpful while taking the shuttle. They told us about going to the Wal-Mart for some groceries. We were also able to pick up beer, wine and some snacks. Of course, if you take the shuttle back to The Grand Mayan you will have to carry your groceries about two blocks. We only bought a few bags of groceries so we did NOT have a problem. You can get a taxi from the Wal-Mart back to The Grand Mayan but it cost 400 pecos. We enjoyed the food at The Grand Mayan. We ate several times at Balche' and then in the evening it becomes Frida's for Mexican food. Had several meals at the buffet which were all very delicious. My husband especially enjoyed the steak buffet. They had several types of steaks, pork chops and salmon. Also, had several mexican dishes to try along with the steak. They have a show every night at 8 o'clock which is free but we enjoyed the shows while we had our dinner at the buffet. We were unable to eat at Tramonto (Italian) because when I called for a reservation they did NOT have one until the following evening at 9 o'clock. Late for a dinner reservation for us. Plenty of places by the pool. We never had a problem getting a lounge. Great pools and a lot of activities by the pool. If you stay at The Grand Mayan you can use two other pools that are just for The Grand Mayan guests. We found them to be quiet. The large pool that is located near The Mayan Palace was more crowded but we were still able to find a lounge without a problem. We also enjoyed walking on the beach. We did not go in the ocean because we did not have shoes to wear since it was very rocky. Lots of lounge chairs at the ocean and they keep the sand very clean. We enjoyed some of their HAPPY HOUR drinks. Also, enjoyed sitting at the swings by the bar and pool at The Grand Mayan. They do have ttwo bars that you can swim up to and get a drink. Had a lot of fun at the pools. We were able to take a trip to Chichen Itza (The New Wonder of the World). It was a great tour but it is very long. We were picked up around 7:45 AM and did not return until 8 o'clock in the evening. We did stop at a Mexican Village and enjoyed a lunch buffet. Of course, it was a 2 1/2 hour trip to the site. We enjoyed taking several trips to the town of Playa and visiting (Fifth Avenue) way different than Fifth Avenue in NYC. My only complaint is that if you are out of your room for several hours and return the room has a musty smell. As soon as we would return we would open the glass sliding doors and it was fine in several minutes. We truly enjoyed our stay at The Grand Mayan.

We traded in here from our time share in Puerto Vallarta, since we wanted to see this part of the Mexica and some of the ruins. We only have a studio unit, so we ended up with only a hotel unit. No kitchen facilities and no coffee maker. Your room is assigned at check in, and we asked to look at a map and got into building one. Glad we did, cause it was a long way to get coffee in the morning. Technically, I could have tried room service, but was sceptical of their \"service\" after the first few morings. The 6 am coffee shop had a broken coffee machine, and the 7 am deli had a different crew every morning. One morning they could not find the cups, another the coffee pots, another the creamer, another the hot sleeves. You get the picture. Bottom line, if you are an early riser and want coffee, don't stay here without a kitchen. The room was kept well cleaned, and the grounds were kept up, but the marble floors and walls carry way too much sound, and the single door between units allowed too much conversation from the neighbors to come through. Running the fan all night was the only way to cover the sound of late night revelers. We had a top floor room which was vastly superior to a ground floor with all the foot traffic to elevators at the center of the buildings. We did get snookered into the time share presentation. 90 minutes promised, with 1000 peso and 10% discount on all charges. The actual time was over 3 hours, despite out insistance that we were not interested. Not worth the agrivation. Nice pools, but the weather never did cooperate much in that area. No beach to speak of. No other resorts or facilities nearby. We took the provided shuttle to Playa del Carmen twice at $40 (pesos) per person each way. It only runs every two or three hours and can be late and packed at times. BTW, if you take it, get in early and get one of the front three rows. The drivers insist on 4 persons in the back row designed to seat 3, and will often sit for several minutes trying to fill that last seat, even it 3 large americans are already there. The collectivo is 20 - 30 pesos per person and must be caught at the main road. Other good sites describe it, and it is an interesting mode of transport. Cab fare can get real pricey at $200 pesos to Playa del Carmen, $300 pesos to Cancun. The fact that we like to sample local restaurants and sightsee made this resort a poor choice for us. OUR BAD.

The staff at The Grand Mayan were all professional and always very helpful! We had room service about half the time we were there and while it was pricey (in comparison with other restaurants) the food was ALWAYS out of this world delicious! It was prompt, just the right temperature and always had the BEST flavor. We had Filet Migon and the Ribeye steaks the first night there and that set the tone, I was hooked. It was DELICIOUS! I would love to get my hands on the recipe for the oatmeal they serve because it was the best I have ever eaten. It's creamy and has the best flavor. They complement it with raisin & pecan halves. YUMMY!!! At EVERY meal we had the best service, the best food, everything was just perfect! One evening we visited Tramonto's (2nd floor above the JADE gift shop) and it was probably the best meal of them all. In addition to the food, the staff would always interact with us and welcome us to Mexico and treated us like we were royalty. The maid service was great as well. Cleaned and freshened everyday, our room was given the utmost attention. I was well pleased with everything except the turn down service, that could be an annoyance at times. While some folks may enjoy that, we did not and found it to be bothersome. The property was beautifully landscaped and was imaculate. The staff were always cleaning and very attentive to our needs. Seeing the flamingos and crocodiles were great also! The Iguana came out on the last day because the weather had warmed up and that was nice! While there we did visit Playa del Carmen and enjoyed it very much. First day was to Wal-Mart (nothing like the states though). The scenery was lovely, however, i would caution anyone who shops with the merchants that try to attract you into their stores. BEWARE! While most everything is negoitable, you should have an idea of what you will pay for anything they ask you to make an offer on. We were taken advantage of by a couple but leaned quickly from our mistake. The beaches in Playa were beautiful and so inviting. There were cabana's along the front of several of the resorts and it made the most beautiful photos We visited Chichen Itza and leaned so much about the Mayan people. If you have the opportunity to go, please make the trip.

Upon our return, the staff was very helpful in transporting our luggage and groceries to building 11 in the Jungle. I was able to park the rental car within walking distance of our room. The room was stunning and spacious. We had a one-bedroom plus a living room and kitchen. There was a deck with a plunge pool. We had a view of a few holes on the golf course. By the looks of it, the building we stayed in was constructed within the last 5 years. The interior finishes were high-end. One minor complaint, the bed mattress was firm but it didn't affect us that much. Other reviews talk about the noise between rooms and the hallway. While there was some background noise, it didn't really impact us at all. I thought the resort was quiet for the most part. The size of the resort is enormous. The Jungle section of the resort (Buildings 8-13) is a good distance from the main lobby and the pools. Their are constant shuttles between these places and we didn't really have to wait long at all for a shuttle. I think only on 2 occasions during the whole week did we wait longer than 10 minutes. The pools are large and beautiful. We used both the Grand Mayan pool and the Mayan Palace pool and enjoyed the atmosphere at both. Their are activities and pool volleyball. The beach is nearby and the only bad thing about this resort is all of the rocks on the beach. While the beach area looked nice, I thought it was impossible to go out in the water with all of the rocks out there. But I did see people out in the water swimming and snorkeling. I did read something that the resort is in the process of removing these rocks. If you're a person that wants to spend a majority of their time at the beach, then this resort is probably not for you. The resort provides diving and snorkeling trips at an additional cost. We did the afternoon snorkeling trip and really enjoyed that. The water is blue and clear with many different tropical fish to see. We had dinners at Tramonto, the seafood buffet at Del Lago and ordered room service on a few occasions as well. We also had breakfast at the golf course resteraunt. We enjoyed all of our meals. Del Lago has an hour long show at 8PM each night which was entertaining. We took day trips to Xel-ha and Cozumel (booked through the resort at additional cost). The resort has many different trips that you can book through them.

There was a thin door that separated us from the room next door and trust me we heard every little thing that went on in the room. The acoustics in the hallway are also bad so that when the baby down the hall woke up at 6am every day, so did we. There is absolutely no nightlife. My sister and I (both in our twenties) were looking forward to hanging out the Wine Bar, as it is gorgeous and overlooks the entire resort.

The rooms, the lobby, pool area and other facilities are aesthetic and maintained to a very high standard. Though the resort is massive and we were there during a peak time, we never felt crowded and could always find a place to accommodate a large group by the acres of pool or on the beach. The food, though overpriced, was fine. This resort is ideal if you are wanting to spend most of your time on site and are prepared to eat the majority of your meals at the many restaurants available. In fact, if this is the case, then I would highly recommend this resort. However, if you prefer to eat home cooked meals once-in-a-while and are the type of person who does not like to spend more money on something than what it is worth, and like to explore the surrounding area, then there a few things to consider. The kitchens look great but are not very functional. Unlike Hilton properties that have, for all intents and purposes the same design, the Mayan units come without an oven. You do get stove top elements and a microwave but when cooking for a large group this is simply not enough. Furthermore the garbage receptacles are puny making preparing food in the unit an inconvenience. It is important to note that the resort is located between Playa del Carmen and Cancun, and is not particularly close to either (17 kms from Playa). Therefore if you do not have a car, you will need to rely on the shuttle service -- it is a good service but is far less efficient than the public buses that run folks around Cancun. Fortunately, for part of our stay we had a vehicle and travel to Tulum and Chichen Itza (I highly recommend taking the old highway and avoiding the toll highway), the roads to and from the resort are safe and provide excellent signs. Let me preface this paragraph by stating I have little sympathy for people who whine about time share presentations, if you do not know what to expect then you have not done your homework and if you have been through one then suck it up and collect your rewards at the end. My wife and I agreed to go as the other couples we were with were not timeshare owners. We believed that because we had made it clear we were satisfied HGVC club members the focus would be on the others and we would be off the hook. Well, to our chagrin, the others were dismissed right after the very nice breakfast and we were summoned to presentation. The bottom line of their pitch was that they wanted us to trade our Hilton membership and its RCI affiliation for a similar package offered by them in which RCI would be replaced by HSI. They offered us (hypothetically) a 25% increase on our Hilton property if we were to make the deal and explained how much better HSI was when compared to RCI. We did not do it -- I suspect the hypothetical 25% increase in purchasing out HGVC would turn into 'we will try and sell for you at this amount'. When I returned I researched HSI and can find few positive hits on this company. However this did not bother me as this is the nature of timeshare presentations. What I found extremely irritating was the way we were dealt with when we went to claim our discount. Someone had made a clerical error and had not included one of our couples as attending the presentation. This in itself is not a bother -- we all make mistakes. What was infuriating though was the way in which we were dealt with. Although the couple in question was able to provide the name of our sale rep., describe in detail the breakfast we ate and provide the name of the sales manager, the employee we dealt with simply did not believe us. Instead of suggesting a clerical error may have occurred (this was to be proven true) she made it abundantly clear that she thought we were lying. It was, by a long shot, the worst customer service I have ever experienced in any hotel/resort.

My parents had gifted us with a stay here using their RCI points. I had read a few reviews before we left but didn\u2019t want to bother with requesting a certain room or building. We were actually just lucky and ended up on the first floor of building number 7. It would have been a bit of a hike to pools and restaurants had we ended up in the higher number buildings, but we walked everywhere (never did figure out how the shuttle system worked) and it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal. We ended up walking from our building to the front entrance of the resort most days, so if we would have stayed in the higher number buildings it would have made this walk shorter. This resort was huge and beautiful. The staff did everything to maintain the grounds and make sure that you were happy. We mainly used this resort as a \u201chome base\u201d while we explored the surrounding area, so we didn\u2019t use a lot of the services that the resort offered. Many people have stated that to get off the resort and explore the area you need a car if you are staying here. I would disagree. We used the collectivos extensively and would highly recommend getting around this way. You don\u2019t have to worry about driving in another country and you can actually experience a part of the local culture that you are visiting. We did not have a car and we went to Playa del Carmen a couple of times, and Puerto Morelos. We could have gotten to Xeh-Ha this way (made a HUGE mistake of taking a big bus tour for this) and we would have also had no problems getting to Cancun or most other places without a car and using the collectivo and ADO bus system. The things we did use at the resort included the pools \u2013 you get access to the Grand Mayan pools and the Mayan Palace pools. They had a different vibe, so if you wanted more action you could head to the Mayan Palace Pools or for a quieter time to the Grand Mayan pools. We\u2019re not big drinkers, so we only used the pool bar a couple of times. Most of our drinks we picked up in Playa del Carmen and just mixed ourselves at our room anyways. We went to a couple of the restaurants \u2013 Havana Moon (excellent meal) and the Mexican restaurant directly by the main pool area (can\u2019t remember the name but also had good food). The food and service at both was excellent and we had no complaints. The beach was rocky (as we anticipated) and it was difficult to get out to swim, but we headed to Puerto Morelos or Playa del Carmen to do some swimming and snorkeling. We didn\u2019t bother going to a timeshare presentation. They asked us to go when we first checked in and they phoned us once near the beginning of our stay, but we let them know we were not interested and they pretty much left us alone after that. Overall, we had no complaints with this resort for what we wanted it for - a home base for us to explore the area.

I mostly use my timeshares for trading but the mayan a few years ago offered its members when they reach 75 to come stay for half maintence fee & when 77 use their week for free. Well since my husband turned 75 this year I decided to come to this Mayan and do a 3 weeks Cancun stay. We stayed the first week in Cozumel-took the ferry to PDC and got to Grand Mayan around noonish. I knew we couldn't check in that early but I wanted to secure a good room. We were assigned to building 6-3rd floor-We had a 2 bedroom unit. I would have liked to be on the side that looked out at lake but none available. I was just happy to be upgraded from Mayan Palace to Grand Mayan. Wow is all I can say about unit. The master had a jacuzi tub-the deck was large and had a plunge pool. We went to the presentation,only to get 10% and find out when The Bliss units weregoing to be complete(We had upgraded to Bliss a year ago). They had wanted us to upgrade to Luxx but I wanted to see Bliss first so declined. We took their shuttle to PDC to hace a lunch and shop-they have regular shuttles going. When we got home we had several bags of groceries so we went to the bar by the golf course-had a happy hour drink & they ordered a shuttle for us. I signed up for 2 tours-One a full day to Chitzen Itza-very well done and another to swim with the dolphins. Everything went smoothly. The maid accidently took 2 of our pool towels when she cleaned-I told them at pool and they replaced them with NO problem. One evening we took a cab to Puerto Morales to eat at John Grays kitchen. Wow-what a meal and what a wonderful place. He has a place in Cancun and they gave me the card with a map-we're going there the next week. Pool-had wonderful beds with sheets pillows and a canopy. The weather the first week in Dec was perfect. We ate snacks at a few of the places and enjoyed them. Our last night we ate at the Italian restaurant and had a wonderful meal with a violin player. I had gotten a voucher via E-mail before I left from home for a free massage. I was expecting a light one-my girl gave me a great massage.

Though the resort was well staffed, we were not impressed by the service. An earlier guest said that you had to flag down the waiters by the pool, which was our experience as well. I would often resort to jumping in the pool to go to the pool bar, but the walkways are slippery and I wasn't the only person that slipped and scraped a knee. Don't go near the sales office. It was the most high pressure sales presentation we have ever seen, and we are veterans of time share presentations.

The balcony area was very large with the wading pool mentioned in other reviews. It was so beautiful watching the various colored birds each morning and drinking our coffee. We did not find the king size beds hard at all as mentioned in other reviews. I guess I have always slept on a firm mattress. We stayed two weeks and rented a car the first week to do our sight seeing and stock up on provisions (Mostly wine, beer, coffee, and snacks). We found that we liked the Metro Mkt (which we think is a Target as some of the brands are the same) much better than Walmart. Actually we made four trips into Playa Del Carmen. Two were the second week and we took the shuttle from the hotel one time and a taxi the other. We spent the day at the public beach there one day, which is quite lovely, and went in the use the cheap phone service and internet in the lobby of the Metro Market and do some shopping and eating on Fifth Avenue the second day. We are seniors, but did not consider the walk to the pools, restaurants, etc., long at all. After you do it a few times and began to know your way around, it becomes shorter and shorter. Occasionally if we did start out at the time the shutter was there, we took it. The second week we took full advantage of the beautiful pools, snorkling, etc. All of the restaurants are very good. We found that the three of us only had to order two entrees and maybe one salad to make a meal. All servings were very generous. Room service was very good and inexpensive when compared to other nice properties. Oh yes, we did attend the time share presentation. When you have two weeks you have time to do this; otherwise, don't bother. It can take almost a full day if you are not a strong willed person.

I'm sure it is set up that way to force you to eat outside the room. That's fine for a couple, but gets very pricey for a family on a budget. Drinks run about $7US, so make sure you buy a bottle or you're drinking during 2x1 Happy Hour. The resort has a \"no cash\" policy. This means you must sign for EVERYTHING. Word to the wise..keep a close eye on your ongoing billing. We found several errors, almost daily, that would have normally gone un-noticed at the end of the vacation. FOOD- Del Lago Restaurant has a different buffet and show each evening. Check out the welcome books early or you may miss the best options. I think seafood night is either Saturday or Sunday...which we missed! There is a variety of food available, but we enjoyed their breakfast buffet best. I'm not sure of the cost as it was part of the presentation package. The shows were not classic Mexican. They were considered \"NEW AGE\", but we considered them \"ODD\". \"ODD MUSIC/ODD COSTUMES/ODD DANCES\". We tried to be open to the \"ART\", but did not enjoy them. HAVANA MOON-was probably the best sit down dinner we had. They had a selections available that ranged from pizza to thai to steak and the service was very attentive. They are also by the beach which was nice for an evening stroll. BLUE FISH- This was casual food served pool side and probably the best that we had. Excellent fish tacos, tuna sashimi and out of this world cheesesteaks. Wish we would have tried the cheesesteaks sooner! TOURS- We took the EXPRESS Chichen Itza tour. It has been declared one on the new seven wonders of the world. This tour company provided a beautiful, comfortable and air conditioned bus & does something I saw nobody else do...They provide umbrellas to guard against the sun during your walk. As silly as this sounds, it gets HOT! Other sweaty tourists were commenting on our umbrellas during the tour. TAKE ONE, you'll need it! The Mayans were sun people for a reason! Also included, you will be given a very lite breakfast in the form of juice and a pastry, a sit down Mexican buffet with drinks at the cenote, tour of Chichen Itza and drinks on the return to your hotel. It's a long day, but a big part of the culture and something that you just have to experience. CAR RENTAL- You could survive without one, but if you like the freedom to explore as we do, the best price came from CARRENTALS.COM Within a week of travel, the price dropped about $200 (to $208 for a tracker) while the car rental sites directly were running about $400. Quite a savings! All in all, it was an enjoyable vacation. The prices however were much more expensive than I have ever experienced in Mexico. It is a modern facility and very Americanized, with cost to match. I have been going to Puerto Vallarta for 20 years. To me, that IS Mexico.

It's just 20 minutes from Cancun Airport and the highway is fantastic (rent a car for the duration of your stay) and the exit to the resort is well-marked. I was in Building 8, in \"The Jungle,\" which was about a 7-minute walk from the Lobby on a winding path. Once I was acclimated to the layout of the resort (which is overwhelming), I enjoyed the leisurely walk to the pools and the beach, past the flamingos and small lagoons with ducks and herons. I did not experience long waits for the shuttle to or from my building when I needed it. My 1-BR suite faced the golf course and parking lot, and it was very noisy at all times of the day/early evening, because the shuttles were going constantly and the gardeners and other maintenance people were always doing something that was loud. If you are assigned to a building in \"the Jungle,\" ask for a room on the Jungle side--better view, less noise. The beds are very hard. A large washer and dryer in each building cost 40 pesos each. I went to Playa del Carmen for groceries--the 1-BR had a nice kitchen--and I agree that food prices in the resort restaurants are high and comparable to DC restaurants. PDC is about 20 minutes away on the very good highway, and it does have some interesting things to see. I went to Coba to see the Mayan ruins. It's not as touristy as Tulum and Xel-Ha, and there were no tour buses. It is a longer drive, but not as far as Chichen-Itza You can rent a bike to ride the flat wide path between the different structures, or hire a pedi-cab. It really is intriguing to see all the structures. Read up on the history of the Mayan civilization before going. On my return from Coba I stopped for lunch at the Lol-Ha restaurant on Akumal Beach, which is a lovely area with little shops and galleries.

We are not members of Groupo Mayan and used points transferred through RCI. This seems to be the main reason why our trip was so frustrating. This will be a long post, but please read before staying through RCI. We arrived at noon on Friday during \"tropical depression\" Ida. We knew that check in was at 5pm (which seems ridiculous to begin with), but we had heard that getting into buildings 1-4 was key (there is a lot of walking regardless of where you stay), so we wanted to get there early in order to put our building request in. After waiting in line for 1/2 hour, we were given a red wrist band and told that we would get a room in building 4, but that we would have to come back at 5pm to get our room keys. No problem. We had a rental car, so we took a trip to Playa Del Carmen to get some groceries at Wal-Mart. When we got back around 4pm, we checked in with the front desk just to see if our room was ready a bit early. We were told that now our room would not be available until 6pm. My husband and I took advantage of the fact that the rain had stopped for a bit and killed some time walking around the property. When we got back to the lobby at 5pm we overheard many guests complaining that their rooms were not going to be ready until 8pm! We felt pretty lucky to be getting our room only an hour after check in and to be getting into one of the closer buildings. I can just imagine how frustrating it would be to travel all day and then wait another 3 hours to get into our room. Plus, most people walking in were soaking wet from the rain, but nobody was offered a towel, a drink or even an explanation. When we were finally given the keys to our room, we went out front to have valet bring our car around. The sun was going down and we started to get bitten by mosquitoes. I was hopping around , slapping myself and flapping my arms for a good 15 minutes before I finally said loudly, \"Where is our car!?\" A valet attendant heard me and asked someone about our car. It turned out that no one had even gone to get it. Another ten minutes and 3 bug bites later, it arrived. We looked around for help getting our 4 suitcases and 10+ grocery bags to our room, but there was no one in sight. My already annoyed husband and I got in the car and went to find the guest parking lot. As we pulled in, there was an empty \"tram\" pulling through. We asked the driver if he could help us get our bags to the room. He told us just to drive our rental car on the tram pathway and take our bags to our room ourselves. It took a little while to figure out where that was exactly and by the time we pulled up, it was fully dark and raining. My husband and I \"stole\" a baggage cart and loaded that sucker up, found the elevator and took everything to the room ourselves. On the way there we were yelled at by a bell hop that needed that cart for some bags he was delivering. We didn't feel all that bad for him. In our room was a note letting us know that if we were not out of our rooms by 10am on the following Friday, we would be charged half of our yearly maintenance fee. It seems outrageous that people could be checked in 3 HOURS late, but that checking out 1 minute late would be grounds for charging hundreds of dollars. The rooms at the Grand Mayan are great, but the bed in my opinion was very hard. After the first restless night, I pulled the long cushions off of the couches in the living room and put them on top of the mattress. Then I called for an egg crate mattress and laid that on top so there was no seam and put the sheets over all of that. The bed was amazingly comfortable for the rest of our trip. The maids just made up the bed every day, couch cushions and all. The first night we had dinner at Havana Moon. We split the Mexican pizza and a Caesar salad while listening to the live band. The floor of the restaurant was covered in water dripping through the roof but people were dancing anyway. The food was tasty and the band was even better. The next morning, we were woken up at 7:30am by a man mowing the lawn below our window. I thought it was strange to be mowing in a tropical storm, but even stranger to be doing it so early in the morning. With visions of a week of early morning mowing, I called down to the front desk to ask if this was a normal occurrence and if there was a way that the lawn could be mowed a bit later. I was transferred twice before being disconnected. I called back and was hung up on. This happened again before I gave up and went back to bed (it was 5:30am our time). Thankfully the mowing stopped 15 minutes later. The next day we went down to the pool to read our books and have some drinks. It sprinkled a bit and there was no sun, but it was warm enough to be enjoyable. We were hanging out for at least an hour before we were approached by the waiter. We obviously could have gone up to the bar ourselves, but we weren't in any hurry. I guess some earlier guest had taken a serving tray and used it to prop the leg of my lounge chair (which I hadn\u2019t noticed) because the waiter started telling me loudly that I \u201ccouldn\u2019t do that\" and that his \u201cboss was going to get mad\u201d at him. I had to tell him at least three times that I didn't place the tray there and that he was more than welcome to take it before he finally stopped ranting and took it in a huff. We were not waited on again. That Sunday night we got in late from Playa del Carmen and there was a letter slipped under our door. It said that Hurricane Ida was going to hit during the night and that the pool and restaurants would be closed and that the power would probably go out. The next day we slept in until late, made breakfast and watched TV. Finally around 2pm we were both getting a little stir crazy and since the weather outside looked fine (it just looked really windy), my husband and I headed out to see the flamingo observatory. There were no flamingos, but we did see that the pool had guests lounging. Apparently the hurricane had missed us and everything had been up and running all day. Oops! On Monday night we called the concierge to get an 8am wake up call, so that we could get an early start on a day trip to Tulum. The next morning when I woke up and looked at the clock, it was 9:15am. I didn\u2019t bother calling to complain or figure out why the wakeup call never came. Tulum was fun and totally worth the 51 peso entrance fee. My favorite part was swimming at the beach. It gets blazing hot with no shade in Tulum, so the water felt wonderful. If you go to Tulum, bring bug spray! My husband, who hardly ever gets bitten, was attacked on our walk back to the car. He got 15 bites (yes I counted\uf04a) in the two minutes it took to notice and get the spray out of the backpack. Luckily I had reapplied after getting out of the water. On Tuesday night we went to the Del Lago restaurant to try the buffet. We didn\u2019t get there until it was a little late (8:45ish) because my husband was scuba diving all day. We were both super hungry, so we were happy to see that Del Lago didn\u2019t close until 10:30pm. When we went to get our food, we were both disappointed to see that everything looked like it had been sitting out all day (crusty film on everything), but we were hungry and it was late, so we tried to make the best of it. On the second trip up we noticed that none of the grills were manned, so we couldn\u2019t get steaks, potatoes, fish, quesadillas, etc. All that was left were side dishes, salad and dessert. We stopped a waiter who was serving himself food from the buffet and asked about getting some steaks and were told that they were out. We asked to speak to the manager. We explained that we didn\u2019t feel as if we should pay $30 usd each for a couple cold fries, crusty chili and a salad and that if they had run out of food, they probably should have closed the buffet. The manager was annoyed and disagreed that anything was missing from the buffet, so my husband walked with him around the entire thing and showed him what we were talking about. After 15 minutes of arguing, the manager talked to the exact waiter who said they were out of steak and then told my husband that they were not out and if we wanted, they would make it for us. We asked if he would return everything else to the buffet as well. He said yes (and acted like we were horrible for even thinking of complaining), but at that point it was 9:30 and we really just wanted to go somewhere else. The manager said that if we didn\u2019t sign for the food, our waiter would end up paying for it. We didn\u2019t know if that was a lie or not and of course we would never make the waiter pay for us, so we signed. We went straight up to the front desk to ask to speak to the hotel manager. We were told that he was on vacation for the day. The next morning my husband went back up and was told that he was on sight, but would not come speak to him. He tried once more before we left and was told that Edgar would call us. He never called. On Wednesday we went down to the pool and met a couple while swimming. At some point during our conversation the woman noticed that I had a red wrist band on. She asked me if I was a member and how I liked the hotel. I told her how disappointed we were, why and that we would never come back again. She was pretty upset and told me that she had spoken to 4 other non member guests and that they had all told her similar stories. She said that as a member (who wore a gold wristband) she was checked in early and had been treated wonderfully. As soon as my husband and I got back to our room we cut off our wrist bands. Too bad we were leaving that Friday (we made sure to send Thursday away from the resort all together) and wouldn\u2019t get to see if we would get better service without them. On Thursday we went to check out early before heading to Playa Del Carmen for dinner. We noticed a strange charge on our bill and asked about it. We were told it was for some civiche that was bought at the pool. We did not buy any civiche and told them so. Twenty minutes later we were told that they could not find the receipt and that if we filled out a paper stating that we would pay for the food if they found the receipt and sign it, they would take the charge off of the bill. My husband said that we were leaving at 10am the next morning and if they found the receipt by then with his signature that he would gladly pay for it, but after seeing how unaccommodating the staff was, we were not about to fly all the way home just to deal with the hotel and a stupid charge that we had no part in. All in all, our trip was fun. We were lucky that we had a rental car and were able to get off of the property. We tried to laugh off all of the little mishaps and bad service and just enjoy each other\u2019s company, but we will never go back to The Grand Mayan or any of their other properties. My husband and I are pretty laid back and all that really matters to us on vacation is a comfortable bed and good service. The Grand Mayan had neither. On the plus side, the property is beautiful the rooms are spacious and the maids were fantastic.

We stayed in building 3 of the Grand Mayan and found the rooms to be very nice, spacious, and well appointed. Generally we found the buildings and rooms clean and well kept. Its about a 5-10 minute walk to everything on the property so the location was not an issue. The shuttle services were available but the service did seem inconsistent so we didn't use it much. The property is absolutely stunning. The pools are impressive (though seemed to close a different pool every day for repairs) with many to choose from. The vegetation and pathways were a treat kept very natural and pristine. the Flamingo park and gator pond are fun to look for.. We parked ourselves on the beach section a couple days and found it to be very comfortable and plenty of places to sit with service. The beach is decent, but it is difficult in out of the water because of the rocks so do bring water shoes. The pools are a wide variety with several having swim up bars (very useful :). We did not have the issue with the timeshare sharks as other reviews have mentioned as we just said no from the beginning. You can save 10% on your bill, but we did not feel it was worth a half a day of our time. Start saying no even at airport. There are a good many restaurants to choose from on site. We stayed away from the big buffet at the Largo and had breakfast at the Havana (it was more reasonably priced and on the beach). You can also find a good breakfast and lunch at the restaurant on the golf course. The Italian restaurant for dinner was very good but pricey. Find the wine master there and he can be very helpful. The Asian restauraunt was not a great experience for us only because we are not Shu Shi eaters and really that's its core menu. The restaurant pool side was ok for lucnh though a little pricey as well. I would not waste your money on the shows. To us they were a lot of money for what you got (The Thursday Mexico show you have to reserve for was at least 55 per person). Put the money you would spend on the shows to renting a car. We rented a car for the week we there and went into Playa del Carmen a few times, and Cancun once. We found it to be extremely useful to have a car (rented from Dollar at airport without pre-reserving. We found this cheaper than doing it in advance online) and found it to be extremely useful and reasonable since it was split between the 2 couples. We did not want to deal with the shuttles and we figured by the time you paid for the taxis etc, we were about even with all the flexibility, convenience and sanity to go with it (being able to go to Walmart and Mega for supplies and liquor made it worthwhile in itself). Driving is real easy since most everything is off of one main road. We just paid attention to the signs and didn't do anything stupid. We did pay extra for the full coverage insurance. The highlights of the week included an all day snorkeling adventure to 3 places with Mexico Blue Dream (highly recommended) which included Yal-Ku Lagoon snorkeling (fabulous, a definite not to miss!!!), cave snorkeling at the Cenotes, and a swim off a beach looking for sea turtles (found 3). Tulum was absolutely worth the drive, as well eating at restaurants in Playa (Cocina 38 our favorite), and you should walk around 5th downtown Playa at least one night. It did rain at least half the week there so that did damper the trip a bit, and the mosquitos were dreadful at the resort, especially at dusk.

There are so many connected pool areas on about three different levels including the private pool only open to Grand Mayan guests and the newest pool by the lobby, that you could swim all day and not get bored of the surroundings. Of course there are also the swim up bars with two for one specials daily. And the waters are kept very clean. We had a master suite both stays so far which included hot tubs in both bedrooms, a spacious living room, a more than adequate kitchen if you want to cook and a nice mini pool out on the patio. I call it a mini pool because it wasn't heated, so if your patio were in the shade, it was often a little cool. Still nice though. The hotels were all open during our stay in February and all offered great food. Don't forget to visit the two crocodile havens on the property. They're kept fenced in, but still very interesting to look at. The pink flamingo hut was also a great attraction to visit while on site. Although there isn't a great night life on the resort at night, there were several activities for kids in the evenings, including movie nights. Cancun and Playa del Carmen were close enough for the older generations to visit for the great night life they both offered.

From there on, the trip definitely went downhill. We were never told there was a safe in the room (obviously did not expect someone to steal our belongings!) but there is one hidden under the TV. If staying the this resort, we would recommend **USING THE SAFE** When we first arrived at the resort, we looked for a safe, but couldn\u2019t find one. We hid all our belongings in nightstand drawer and closet, obviously under the assumption that no one would be going through our stuff! After finding our stuff missing, we filed a report with the security supervisor, and not much was done regarding the incident. We thought our situation would be handled in a more professional manner. After the security supervisor scanned our key card, we were stunned to find as many as 6 different staff members coming through our room on separate occasions. There is no reason that many people should be going through our room throughout the day. No wonder our stuff got stolen, with all the people allowed in our room, its hard to keep track of all them! Anyway, after our key card was read, we got locked out of our room from 11pm-2am. For some reason the key card reader deactivated our door and NO ONE could get in. They couldn\u2019t even get the master key to work! We had to wait for them to call the maintenance guy in Playa Del Carmen and get him a taxi to come fix the door. So finally at 2pm, after having our stuff stolen, and getting locked out of our room, we got to go back in! Needless to say, the last 3 days of our trip were ruined. We had a trip planned to Cozumel and Isla Mujeres we had to cancel because we had no cell phone and did not feel safe leaving the resort. Honestly from that point on, we didn't really feel safe at the resort either. Our bad luck continued when we got pulled over in our rental car, on the way to the airport at 4am\u2026for absolutely no reason. We had to pay off the cops in order to get our license back. They said it was going to be $120, but we gave them $40, since when can you negotiate a ticket? The cops did not speak one word of English, miraculously, until it was time to talk about money.

Travelled with five other friends and stayed in a Grand Master Suite with two bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a small pool on the balcony. The room was in great condition and very clean when we checked in. The resort complex is huge, with 12 buildings spread throughout. Buildings 1-7 are close to the lobby and the pools. The other buildings are a hike, but there are shuttles that will take you throughout the resort that run every 5-10 minutes. There are multiple, very large pools, two with swim up bars. The pools are located along the beachfront side of the resort. As other reviews have stated, the water line is extremely rocky. You will need water shoes if you want to go into the ocean. However, the beach is very nice, with plenty of lounge chairs and umbrellas. Water sports are available through the resort on the beach for a fee. We took the snorkeling trip for $50 per person which took you to two different snorkle spots as well as a private beach. The trip included beer, water and soda. If you decide to do this, ask for Martin (pronounced Martine) at the water sports shack. Some of the people in our group had never gone snorkeling before. Martin patiently explained everything to them and helped them with their equipment. Martin was probably the warmest most helpful person we met on this trip. There are multiple restaurants, however not all are open every day during the low season. In fact, on Wednesday of our stay, the only options were the Italian restaurant, the pool side cafe and room service. Havana Moon is currently closed for several weeks. We were told it will not reopen until the high season starts again some time in November. The Italian restaurant was good, but a little pricey. The food available at the pool bar was very good for lunch and snacks. The pool side cafe is just OK. There is not a lot of nightlife at the resort. So plan on going into Cancun if you are looking for clubs. The resort itself is beautiful and very well maintained. If you stay at the Grand Mayan you have access to all of the pools and amenities. Another guest was staying at the Mayan Palace, which is located in the same complex, told us that they were restricted to the use of the Mayan Palace pool only. Do bring bug spray! The mosquitos were pretty fierce at night. I used a light application of Off once a night and I was fine, but learned the hard way. The service at the Grand Mayan was excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful. The staff seemed to go out of their way to make your stay memorable. The service at the pool bar closest to the lobby was fantastic. The bartenders Aquiles and Santos made our time there fun and memorable. One of the waiters at the pool bar even went to the towel hut for us to get us pool towels. A little tipping does go a long way here. We gave housekeeping a small tip on the first day and our rooms were always spotless and we had more than enough towels in the room for 6 people. But I suspect that the service would be great even without tipping. The resort's check in time is 5pm. We arrived at about 11 am, but after a small tip, we were able to get a room right away. i suspect that even without the tips, the service would have been great. Playa Del Carmen is about 30 minutes away and the resort provides shuttle services for $4 per person. Cancun is about 40 minutes away via cab. If you do take a cab, get a price quote up front. The taxis do not have meters and if a driver offers to wait for you, there is an additional charge that they won't tell you about unless you ask. But it was definitely worth it. You do not have to pay the driver until you return to the resort. Overall, I would highly recommend this resort. I have stayed at hotels and resorts all over the world and the Grand Mayan is up there with the best of them. The facilities, grounds and staff are terrific.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "mass", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time\u201d", "Author": "joliee25", "ReviewID": "UR46635212", "Content": "We enjoyed a great family reunion.

We were disappointed that none of the pools was more than four feet deep (perhaps one of the closed pools was deeper?) Best tips - get an egg crate for your bed or endure a very hard mattress and ask for building 1-3 for close access to pool or buidling number 10. The room was lovely. The plunge pool on the balcony was perfect after a long day of sightseeing. The kitchen had a stovetop, small refrigerator and a microwave, but no oven or dishwasher. It was good for breakfast and reheating leftovers. The sink was small but usable. Every staff person you see is very friendly. Kudos to the gal who found us lost on the walkway weary and frustrated and took our bags from us and led us to our building. We generally found guests to be friendly as well. Start a conversation with someone at the pool or on the shuttle. We discovered a couple to share a rental car to Tulum for the day. Tulum is an hour car ride away. Beware of \"topes\" which are steel bumps in the road for reduced speed areas. Pay attention to the signs that warn you of them - they are like speed bumps on steroids and you must crawl over them. The speed limits change abruptly for no apparent reason in short distances. Be sure to obey posted speed limits at all times as the police are very vigilant. Go earlier in the day to avoid the heat. Pay the $2 for the train to the front door. Beware the \"official ticket\" counter and find the one selling the wristbands on the left. Again, be friendly when considering a tour. If you get a \"group\" there is a discount. I recommend no more than 8 in a group for the best pricing and ability to hear the guide. Despite the promotional material, the beach pictured is no longer open to the public. There is a place to go down to the water, but snorkeling is not allowed. Use the restrooms by the entry to the park rather than at the parking lot--they are much cleaner! While in Tulum vist a little beachside hotel called Zamas that has a restaurant that came highly recommended. They have parking by the street and you go through the trees. Don't let the outdoor venue fool you, the food is excellent. The menu is small, but everything we ate we thoroughly enjoyed Try the prawns or the Beef with gnocchi, mushrooms and spinach. Prices were reasonable and you dined with ocean waves at your feet. Bring water everywhere! Two liters per person per day is what you should plan on, plus beverages with meals. The concierge was not as helpful as we would have liked. We never got a wake up call on the day of departure. The shuttle schedule can be inconvenient. They try to pack more than the allowed 9 people into the van and unfortunately the shuttle is not owned by Grand Mayan so there is little they can do. The ferry schedule to Cozumel was very confusing - two different companies run the ferry and you must return on the same color ferry you left on. Be sure to check your departure time on your ticket. Be sure to check out Parque Chakanaab. If you buy your ticket at the ferry dock when arriving in Cozumel you pay a little more, but get a few freebies down there. Inside the park there is snorkel gear for rent. See if Mario is around. He'll take you out into the water and show you the underground statues and various special places to view the fish. There was no fee the day we went, he simply asked us to tip him as we felt led. Ten dollars was sufficient to make him happy and we felt we got a bargain. If we go back, however, we will try Xel Ha for snorkeling after speaking to others who went there. Speaking of bargains. Never pay full price to the street vendors. Everything is negotiable. Try starting lower than you're willing to pay and go up from there. Leave the shop if you aren't happy with the price and they will follow you into the street. Often there is a vendor two doors down who has a similar item for sale. They know that and want to make the sale. Be sure to negotiate in pesos and have plenty handy. They will try to manipulate the conversion rate to their advantage if you use American money. We purchased a lovely dress for a huge discount when we showed the vendor what we had left for money at the end of the day. The Grand Mayan was definitely a resort and you never had a hint of any safety issues.

We took the $4 shuttle into Playa once and I swore I wouldn't do it again. it's what you expect while on vacation - cattle hurded into a small van... while the driver drives to other stops even though the van is FULL and everyone has the same destination. We were able to drive to Tulum for a fraction of the cost, thus saving us having to do the four hour, over priced guided tours. (It was way too hot to be there any longer than an hour!) In terms of nightlife, there isn't much. Though we love to throw them back, we found that each night, we were exhausted from the sun and a great meal. Went back to our room to relax on the balcony.

The rooms are amazing; the largest and one of the most luxurious ones we have stayed in. Some insights that may assist you in the future in your interest in staying here. A. Check in *If you arrive before 5pm; the resort will tell you the rooms will not be released before 5pm and you will have to wait until then to check in. However, if you flash some \"green\" rooms seem to mysteriously appear. My wife and I were told we had to wait (arrived at noon) but after giving the front desk clerk $5; a room was available within 2 minutes. Call ahead of time and request a room in building 1-6 as there is a great deal of walking involved in the resort and these buildings are closest to the pools and beach. If you are a golfer; one of the outlying buildings (8-13) are ideal as they are on the golf course however about a mile walk to the pools/beach. B. Rooms *the rooms are spacious and equiped well. We reserved a two bed room unit. Each bedroom is separated from a common living area including sitting area, dining room, and kitchen. Each bedroom has a king size bed; couch that pulls out to sleep 2; 32 inch tv; ceiling fan and invdividual thermostat. There are sliding doors in the rear leading to a large patio overlooking the resort. Each bedroom has a private bath that includes a shower and separate tub. One unit has a vanity area equiped with make up mirror and hair dryer and a garden tub. Other unit has a spa tub large enough for 2. The sitting area has 2 couches that can each sleep 2 making it available to sleep 12 in this suite. The dining area has a table for 4 and a pass through bar for 2. The kitchen has stove but no oven; microwave; blender, coffee maker and 2.1 cubic ft. refrigerator/freezer. There is dish washing liquid available but no dishwasher. You need to provide coffee and filters as they are not provided. Cutlery, dishes, and glassware are provided for 8. The resort provides bottled water in each room however they will charge you $20 each if you consume them so purchase water and bring with you when you come or get it at a local store. The beds are hard as a rock but I informed the housekeeper and she brought a large pad that covered the bed making it a more comfortable unit to sleep on. One bedroom as a private pool measuring about 6 ft. by 4 ft and 2.5 ft. deep. Maid service is daily and nightly bed is turned down unlike most time shares that provide a weekly towel service. Staff very helpful and outgoing! Amenities *There are many amenities on this resort however remember that this is a non-all-inclusive resort so you will have to pay for the use of everything with the exception of the pools and the beach. The pools are magnificent however the pools are the Grand Mayan were shut down for repairs during our stay and not available. The Mayan pools were great none the less and within a 5 minute walk from the lobby. The beach is nice for walking but not good for swimming. It is very rocky so you will need shoes. The water is very clear and good for snorkling however there is not a great deal to see as hurricane Wilma did a number on the reefs in 2005. There are multiples chairs, loungers, and daybeds available for use at no cost (first come/first serve). You can not reserve and any personal items left for over an hour will be removed; however there were very few guests on the resort so chairs outnumbers guests. 2 swim up pools bars. The resort has happy hour from 11-2 daily on drinks. One drink costs $6.50-8.50 so this gives better value for money. Towel service is provided. Internet is provided at cost as well. Lots of computers to use and always available whenever I went to use them. Game room for the kids with lots of options to keep them occupied. Resort has daily list of activities for both adults and kids; however check with activities desk to ensure they will take place. Due to low numbers of guests on sight; some are not offered. There is a spa and health club on sight. Spa is priced based upon what service you wish to schedule and fitness room is available for under $10 a day. Fitness room includes aerobics and fitness classes. Has a very nice golf course but I do not play golf so do not know what cost is for this. Dining *There are 9 eating establishments on property including 4 dining options. A couple of the restaurants have either a band or dj nightly for dancing. There is a fiesta show on Thursday nights for $55 a person. All-inclusive dinner and show; very entertaining. My wife and I did not eat dinner but were allowed to watch show; just not able to eat or drink but was a great show and lots of audience participation. Night concluded with dancing to dj. Check with the front desk to see what restaurants are available. During the week; there were three nights when the resort was sponsoring some local events and restaurant was closed. Also due to low number of guests staying on property; not all restaurants were open each night. Can not comment on service as we did not eat on property. Went to Wal-Mart and purchased food and ate in our room. Prices in restaurants are quite responsible for this type of resort. Tramonto and Del Lago are dressy casual or better; no shorts, jeans, t-shirts and all others are casual. There is a small grocery store on property but a bit pricey; however if you are not doing a great deal of shopping, more convenient than going to Playa as resort is in middle of no where and not close to any town. Transportation *The resort has a shuttle that goes around the resort and will pick you up at your building and take you to the lobby. It runs every 15 minutes or in Mexican time; within 30 minutes or so. It runs from 7am until 11pm. The resort was only 23% capacity so were able to call the lobby and have one come to pick us up most any time we needed. There are three options to getting around the area. You can take the local bus. Costs about $1.50 to get to Playa but one must be very flexible in time as they stop for anyone who wants to board. Used by the locals so you don't know who or what will sit beside you. No air conditioning and not built for comfort. But very economical. Stops at bus station in town soo you have to walk to wherever you want to go. You have to walk to the front of the resort (approx. 1 mile) to get to the bus as the resort will not take you unless you pay for the ride. Secondly is the shuttle. Picks you up at the lobby and takes you to the bus station in Playa. Costs about $8 a person and is air conditioned. Stops at other resorts on the way but still faster than bus. Lastly is a taxi. Taxis come to the building you are staying in to pick you up (walk is a half to a mile from the buildings to the lobby) and take you directly to your destination. Taxis also drop you off at your building. Costs $15 one way for up to 5 people. Takes only 15 minutes to get to Playa and was our transportation of choice. Ride to the airport from resort is $32. Time share presentations. *There are a great variety of time share presentations available in the area. See them in the airport when you arrive. If you are interested in them, they are interested in you. If not; they will leave you alone. The resorts are offering lots of benefits to take their presentation. However, if you do plan on doing so; do not let the staff at the Mayan know as they will discourage you from attending. They will do everything in their power to prevent you from attending. For example; my wife and I went to the Moon Palace presentation and in return received an all inclusive day at their resort including 2 spa treatments; free local tours including Holkan Kingdom Zip Line; Jungle Tour; Wet N'Wild; Isla Mujeres, Tulum/Xpu-Ha; Checken Itza. All included transportation to/from resort. My wife and I went on 4 tours and with the all inclusive day; benefit was over $700. The Grand Mayan has tours as well but would not recommend it. You will receive a complimentary breakfast and 1000 pesos (about $75-80). Very high pressure sales; took us 6 hours to get loose as they sent 7 different sales representatives to our table to convince us to purchase their product. Then afterward; did not want to give us our beneifts. So do as you please but this resort offers little incentive vs. others. Palace Spa for instance gives an all inclusive day and $150 cash. Tips; Remember this resort is not an all inclusive resort so be prepared to have lots of hands extended to you for tips. Everyone expects a tip from the pool attendant; shuttle drivers, housekeepers, etc. We did find that if you do tip; the service (which was excellent) became exceptional. Overall; this resort was very nice but with all the tours my wife and I went on; only spent one day at this resort. We have traveled in Mexicao before but only with all-inclusive resorts. So this was a nice twist as we could tour the area and experience Playa, Cozumel, and Cancun without having to have the investment of the all inclusive. The resort has lots of wildlife around so be prepared to see some interesting animals (we saw squirrel monkeys, iquanas, crocodiles, and something resembling an anteater). Bring lots of bug spray and either a poncho or umbrella. The bugs are really bad; especially in the evenings and it rains everyday. We really enjoyed ourselves at this resort would like to return in the future.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cHad a great trip!\u201d", "Author": "babeegigi", "ReviewID": "UR44483073", "Content": "We stayed at the Grand Mayan and had a wonderful time.

I think they put all RCI members in the Jungle area (far from everything). Grand Mayan rooms were very nice, spacious, clean. We went during slow season (August - November), so the resort was not crowded at all, which was very nice. The photographer at the hotel, Charlie, was amazing. Definetly treat yourself to some pictures! Food was ok there, nothing superb. We did the Fiesta on Thursday that the resort has, and it was great, buffet, open bar & show for about $55 per person. We brought some food from home and then stopped at Walmart in Playa our first day there to pick up some stuff to make for breakfasts, lunches, snacks, which saved on food bill not having to eat out all the time. Also, Walmart sells alcohol for pretty cheap, so we picked some up, and that also saved us a ton on liquor bill. Playa del Carmen is about 20 min away from the resort. The resort has shuttles to take you for about $4 per person. The beach at the resort does suck, we did bring water shoes, but it's kind of annoying to lug them around with you to have to go to the beach there. Go into Playa if you want to swim in the ocean. The resort has a lot of pools, the only bad thing was that the Grand Mayan sanctuary area was closed due to remodeling. Please, don't waste your time with the timeshare presentation! I am also a Mayan timeshare owner as well as RCI. As a Mayan owner, please take it from me, don't do it & don't listen to their pitch.

There were 6 of us total in the Grand Master Suite--this room is one of the best I've stayed in, and it includes a private dipping pool on the balcony/patio. The suite had 2 full bedrooms, 2.5 bathrooms, a full kitchen (fridge, microwave, blender, oven/range, bar stools), living room, kitchen table, and large patio. We slept 6 people easily: 2 in each of the bedrooms, and 2 in on the sofa pull-outs in the living room. My only complaint would be that the bedding is pretty hard and I felt sore a few days from sleeping on it. We stayed in building #6 and I found it to be pretty convenient to the main pool and lobby areas. It was probably a 5 minute walk to the pool, but it goes fast with the iguanas, del Lago restaurant, and plush walkways. I would definitely recommend requesting a building between 1-6 for convenience. Our group never needed to take a shuttle but we saw them around all the time. Upon arrival, the Grand Mayan's lobby is beautiful! The staff was very helpful and made us feel welcome. I especially appreciated the help of bellmen because they were ready to store luggage, order a taxi, or give information at any time. They truly are a great asset to this property. One of them even drove us directly to our room when we got there so we didn't have to wait for a shuttle. Unfortunately the Grand Mayan's private pool was closed for renovations. This area looked very nice and we were disappointed we couldn't use it, but the other pools more than make up for it. We stayed at the pool for at least 3 full days....make sure you're there by 11 for the 2x1 until 1:00pm. They say 2 x 1 for anything \"mexican\" which was pretty much all drinks...beer, frozen drinks, etc. There is also a drink of the day which is 2x1 from 11 - 5pm. I really liked the poolside food, which you can order from any of the servers walking around the pool. The pizzas are good and are 2 x1 on Fridays! The staff at the pool was very entertaining....Carlos and Jorge did a lot during our week and we loved them. Every day there was a pool activity..trivia, golfing with tennis balls, flip flop kicking contests, water aerobics, and bingo. They also kept us entertained with good music! Between the 6 of us, we made good use of the taxis to/from Playa del Carmen. We didn't find it necessary to rent a car at all, not even for our day trip to Tulum. Our cab driver one day offered to take us around all day to Tulum, Paradise Beach, and a freshwater cenote....all for only $40 USD per person. It was my favorite day of the whole trip! We were gone from 10am - 6pm and he took us to/from all of the excursions. Paradise Beach was simply amazing ...a local beach but the most beautiful I have been to. There was also a really good beach bar/restaurant and gorgeous bathrooms. We ordered room service several times and it was really good! My favorite was the fettuccine alfredo. The Grand Master Suite was a comfortable place to come home to after being out all day. We even had a few kittens join us on the patio! Havana Moon and Tramonto restaurants were really good...the wine bar at Havana Moon is pretty pricey though. We stocked up on groceries and booze from Wal Mart in Playa del Carmen (15 minute drive) to save money, and this was a must. If you're looking for a resort with a lot of nightlife...I'm not sure if this is the right place for you. There were beach parties a few nights but most of the bars close around midnight. We drank at the resort and then made our way to Playa del Carmen for the rest of the night. If you go to Playa del Carmen, you have to go to Fusion right on the beach. It's a beach bar/party with live band, fire dancers, and lots of people. For food...we went to Media Luna and it was delicious. A quick note about the beach at the Grand Mayan....yes, others were correct to say you can't swim in it. However there are plenty of comfortable beach chairs on the sand as well as beach volleyball. The pier is really pretty! I am a really big beach person, so I just went to Playa del Carmen, Paradise Beach, and Cancun for swimmable beaches. I would definitely recommend this resort for all age groups! The 6 of us ranged from 23-29 and found it to be exactly what we were looking for. Other vacationers were very nice and it's easy to meet people at the pool. My favorites about the Grand Mayan: room accomodations/decor, swim=up bars, 2 x 1 drinks, beautiful pool, and the staff.

The trip, the area, the people, and the resort were all fantastic and worth twice the price. First of all the resort is spectacular. With acres of pools, gardens, and golf, you never need to leave. But there is much to see (more on that later). We ate mostly at the Tramanto and the pool restaurant. The food at Tramonto was spectacular. I especially recommend the seafood, although we met a couple who also raved about the beef. Cecilia the hostess and Arturo our waiter were superb and took good care of us. I think the consensus of the folks we talked to indicated that Tramonto was the best restaurant on the property. If you are from a large city like us you will find the entre's at about $ 20 to $ 25 very reasonable. Internet is only available at the Cyber cafe. I couldn't get on my companies VPN through my own computer so it became a 5 pound paperweight and found it more convienent to use the hotels computers to check email There were about a dozen of them and I always found one available. They worked fine. When at the resort we were at the furthermost pool near the Spa and gym. The pool bar was open early and convienently provided quick service for the happy hour which started at 11 each morning. Be sure to answer the last call at 1 PM to take advantage of the full two hours of happy hour available. Food can be ordered right next to the pool. We found the burgers, Quesadilla's, and Nachos our favorites, and very reasonably priced. The spa was terrific and my wife worked out there daily as I did laps in the empty pool at 8 each morning. Our room was a 1 Bedroom suite, with a very well supplied kitchen. It was gorgeous and superbly cleaned day and evening by the staff. My wife emailed concierge ahead of time and asked to be in building one (thanks previous Trip advisor contributors) and although they wrote back they couldn't promise, we were put in building one. This was very convienent. We are not big breakfast eaters so we stopped at Walmart in Playa del Carmen the first day and purchased cereal, yogart, milk, sodas, and beer and made it through the week, no problem. Don't rent a car to go to Walmart though, the resort also has a shop that has breakfast food; eggs, bacon, ham, milk, beer, wine, snacks, etc for eating in as needed. We had them make a couple turkey and ham sandwiches for us the morning we were leaving and they were great on the flight several hours later back to Washington DC. We rented a car from Hertz when we arrived and thought the price was high, so we used the heck out if for 3 days and took it back. I think it was advertised at $ 30 per day, but by the time you added Mexican insurance and several taxes it was more like $ 75 per day. I think a better deal is to use the hotel shuttle to get to the resort, meet someone you like, and share a car for a day or two. You can rent one from Alamo at Mayan Palace for about $ 60 per day. We did that for a day with a newly wed couple we met and went down to Tulum and Akumal Beach. With gas it was about $ 40 for the day for each couple. Our 24 your old son was worried about us \"getting off the reservation\"....too bad we went everywhere. First of all Playa del Carmen is a jewel of a town. All the action is on Fifth Ave and you are never more than a half block from a police car. They realize that tourism is their only industry in this part of Mexico and they are not about to let anything interfere with that. We always felt very safe there. Our favorite restaurant was Madeira Terra (Mother Earth). It was recommended by Odette at the Grand Mayan concierge. We had their steak and lobster special (299 pesos, about $ 23 US) and my favorite, the Lobster Taco. Shopping specials in Playa del Carmen were carved gord lamps and silver. We also spent a day driving and touring Chichen Itsa (about a 9 hour round trip). Terrific trip. We took the toll road and stopped in Valladolid for a late lunch on the town square. The road is very well maintained, but pretty desolate, so make sure your car is in good shape, full of gas, and someone knows your where abouts. Our favorite days were spent on the beach in Akumal snorkeling with the turtles. This location is about half an hour south of Playa del Carmen and 20 minutes north of Tulum. There is a pristine beach, dive shops, rental chairs, hotels and restaurant (Lo Ha). We used the Akumal Dive shop, Friendly staff, lockers, and fresh water showers. You have to swim about 1/2 mile out (in very calm waters) to see the turtles, fish, coral, rays, etc, so I recommend the floatation life vest to help you with the distance. We hung out at this beach two days and rented snorkel gear for about $ 22 each. We don't snorkel much, but I think I would buy a mask and snorkel to fit my face before doing it again. The rental equipment is just average. No need to lug flippers or vest, but a mask doesn't take up much more space than a pair of shoes. Speaking of shoes, others are correct that the beach at the Grand Mayan is not \"swim friendly\". You need some foot protection there. At Akumal leave them at home and bring your own mask and snorkel instead. The beach is sandy. The chairs were only 50 pesos each (about $ 4) for the day. And the Lo Ha restaurant was very reasonble, had cold drinks and a friendly staff. Another trip we took while we had the car was to go to XCarat (pronounced \"esh-Ka-ray\"). We did not do the whole day (about $ 80 or $ 90 US), we went after 4 PM for $ 50 each. It is a combination of water park and wild animal park. You can definitely spend the day there, snorkeling, boating, seeing the shows and animals. We went for the animals (largest butterfly enclosure in the world), panthers, monkeys, birds, turtles, and the 2 hour Mayan/Folk show that starts at 7 PM. This was worth the $ 50 all by itself. Terrific display of Mexican antiquity and folk history. We don't speak Spanish much beyond, \"Hola, buenas dias\", but it was wonderful to see the pride shown by the Mexicans attentending the show. We can't wait to go back. Everything about this part of the world was a wonderful experience. The resort and staff at the Grand Mayan made it even more so.

I am very picky---snobby even---about where I stay, and this place exceeded my expectations. The property is massive; in fact, there were parts of the resort that I just happened to stumble upon on my last night there because I got lost! You could easily spend each day of your stay in a different area of the resort and fully enjoy yourself. Everything was 100% well-kept, and literally the only thing I noticed that was even slightly unkempt were a few missing tiles on the pool ground. But honestly, that was the ONLY thing out of place on the entire property. The rooms are beautiful--very tastefully decorated. I'm big on decor, so the simple, yet contemporary decor of the room, with the appropriate amount of culture was perfect. I went with a group of girlfriends (five total) and we all stayed in a one-bedroom. We all overpacked, and there was still plenty of room for all of our luggage, clothes, toiletries, etc. Food was amazing. There was no shortage of places to eat here, and I didn't even get to visit each of the restaurants/eateries the resort offered. The portions are very generous, and there were several times I could not finish my meal (rare!) because I had gotten so full--this is particularly true at Havana Moon. No worries though, because each restaurant had a supply of \"to go\" boxes on hand and the leftovers made for great snacks! My only complaint was that there wasn't any \"authentic\" Mexican food. I really had a craving for some home-style tacos, but the ones they served with super fancy (ie. commercial) so although they were still delicious, I could have used less commercialism. But then again, I guess in a place so luxe, Taco Bell-style tacos would have been out of place! If you ordered for the restaurants or in the pool area, gratuity was included in your bill, so it was a real life saver to not have to carry around a bunch of small change for tips every time I ordered something. I thought meals/drinks were very reasonably priced; I spent way less on food/drinks than I expected and was actually shocked at the prices. (The boutique store was a little more expensive, though, but that is to be expected) The service at this place is unparalled! Every single person on that resort greeted you with a smile, no matter if they worked in the lobby, were cleaning rooms, groundskeepers, waiters, or towel guys. Everyone went out of their way to ensure you were treated with the utmost respect and politeness. They definitely went above and beyond to make you feel welcomed and valued. I will regretfully admit I had a certain image of Mexicans before I visited, and I am ashamed that I ever believed the hype. There wasn't one single person (including airport personnel, resort staff, off-site excursions, street vendors) who didn't treat me respectfully and warmly. In my experience, they were truly among the nicest people I have ever met in my travels. I most certainly will be back to this resort, and will recommend it to EVERYONE I know visiting Playa del Carmen.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Weehawken, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cParadise in Mexico - Wish I was back!\u201d", "Author": "Christen25", "ReviewID": "UR38105397", "Content": "My family & I stayed @ The Grand Mayan from August 1st - 8th.

The rooms were incredibly clean and spacious! The maids came 2 times per day and even turned the bed down @ and put some hershey kisses on our pillows ;) The resort - What can I say? It was amazing. I called a month in advance & requested a close building, which put us in building 6. This was about a 5 minute walk to the main pool areas. The pools were huge and beautiful. We always found a space to sit even with the hotel @ 92% occupancy. There is happy hour @ the pool swim up bars from 11am-1pm. Then there is an additional drink special of their choice 2 for 1 from 1-5 pm. The drinks by the pool are nice and strong & the service is awesome. Everyone was just so nice all the time! There are palapa beds near the pool area, which cost about $30 dollars per day. We got one almost every day. If you spend more than the 30 in drinks and food, they take it off your bill so it's free ;) The Grand Mayan pool was more secluded and a little bit more up scale...only Grand Mayan members can stay there, where the Grand Mayan members can use the Mayan Palace pools as well. I found the restaraunts @ the hotel to be pretty good. We ate @ Tramonto, Havana Moon and the mexican restaraunt by the pool....We also did the Mexican Fiesta on Thursday which was very good. I think it was about $50.00 per person, but it includes the buffet, drinks and a show that is about 1 and a half hours long. Yes the beach is rocky and not the best to go in if you don't have water shoes, but it really didn't matter to us. We stayed in the pool all day & actually ended up renting a car so went to the beach in Tulum after we saw the ruins and then spent a day @ a beach club in Playa. We also did a snorkling tour through the hotel which was great! It was only $49.00 and included 3 hours worth of snorkling, beaching and of course cerveza! We rented a car through Alamo and everything went very smooth. It was about $200 for the week. We felt it was worth it as we drove the car 1 hour to Tulum, Playa for the day and then two nights we went to Playa for dinner. To sum it up..the rooms were great, food was wonderful...facilities were superb...and overall we had a great experience....We are RCI members and can only go to Grand Mayans 1 out of every 5 years...and we are trying to figure out a way to go back before then!", "Date": "August 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico", "Title": "\u201cworst service I've ever had\u201d", "Author": "rafa_nomad", "ReviewID": "UR37753583", "Content": "The hotel has an awesome infrastructure.

Most of the reviews have said that the ocean at Grand Mayan is not swimable (Because of the rocky bottom). We found a way to solve the problem when we were there last May. My wife is a beach person, so we were disappointed when finding out the rock is kind of sharp. In the resort store we bought water shoes, those with rubber bottom and netting top, we spent $30 for a pair, at home, Wal-Mart sells them only for $15. Armed with these shoes we were able to enjoy the ocean as much as we want. Actually the water is pretty clear, we even managed to find a spot where you can see some fish (Near the left hand side rope, somebody tied a white t-shirt, hope it is still there). It is better to rent a car. It will offer you endless options and could end up save some money. 1. Go to the resort and return to the airport by taxi will cost you some $70 (unless transportation is included in your package), which is about \u00bc of the weekly rental cost. 2. You can go places. With a car, you can go to the same popular tour destination like Tulum without paying a lot, or you can go to Puerto Morelos, a not yet popular tour place but offers world-class swim and snorkeling. A tour for a family of 4 could cost as much as the rentals. We went to Maui, Hawaii in July, we drove to the top of the volcano (more than 10,000 feet), tried almost all the beaches and finally found one to our satisfactory (not too many people, good swimming and exceptional snorkeling), although it is only less than 3 miles away from our resort, it is a bit too far to walk. Without the car, we could not do any of those things, not to mention visiting other places and shopping. 3. You can try different restaurants and save (unless your package is all inclusive). Restaurants in Playa del Carmen are about 1/3 cheaper than those in the resort and the food quality is quite good. 4. There are Wal-Mart in both Playa del Carmen and Cancun, compare the food price with resort store, you would be quite happy with savings of preparing meal in the kitchen of your unit (we noticed the difference by only cooking simple breakfasts, imagine if you also do a few dinners).", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cLearn about Mexico from the hospitality of its people.\u201d", "Author": "NewYorkMexicoLindo", "ReviewID": "UR37090613", "Content": "We have always been impressed with the service of employees of the GrupoMayan resorts we have visited over the years throughout Mexico. This was our first visit to the Grand Mayan Riviera, and once again, we were not disappointed with the generosity of the waiters, clerks, chambermaids, maintenance engineers and administrative staff. Clearly they represent a work ethic that mirrors both the Mexican culture and how they value their jobs are during these economic times. Each employee takes his/her work seriously--and we were grateful. From meeting my physical need for a room closer to the amenities to filling special orders from the restaurants and bars, the service was impeccable. Not enough can be said about the employees of the Grand Mayan. Thanks to all. That said, we were disappointed with the overall design and layout of the facility. Much can be said these days about full service resorts, including their safety and convenience providing a one stop shop for leisure travel. Many provide expansive layouts adorned with tropical environments that coexist with 18 hole golf courses too. But we feel that the overall design of the Grand Mayan is completely beyond human scale and dwarfs the weary traveler. The great distances from each building to the facilities are served by circling golf carts and the hotel does try to keep all guests moving and comfortable. Still the distance and heat on some days was a factor in our decision to stay in or venture a long walk to a swim in the many pools there. We never want to the beach, as it was rocky and felt generally isolated. We also found that some of the programs, exercise and yoga, and other services were either cut or cut short because of low business. Staffing never seemed to be at a breaking point, yet bars on our side of the hotel were always closed by 5PM indicating that staffing could be an issue. The rooms themselves are maintained well. We recognize that that high humidity creates many maintenance issues, but the staff is attentive and will address what is needed; from a broken TV to accumulated mildew in the ceilings, all were taken care of in short order. The location of the resort is isolated. Distance and travel to any major town, including Cancun or Playa del Carmen will require taxi, car service or rental. All are good options, but for the road warrior, all major highways are well paved, supervised by traffic police and we felt safe at all times. Consider renting a car for a short one hour trip to Akumal, and visit Las Casitas, where we enjoyed a full day on a beautiful beach with a bar/restaurant conveniently located, with beach accessory rentals readily available. Our family enjoyed our visit, because we spent time together in our kitchen, cooking, eating and sharing some time by the pools. Its a good place to regroup with friends too. What i liked least was the distance to all the amenities and the pools, which are heated by a relentless sun--making the water hotter than bathwater. The hotel should also make efforts to put WiFi in each room. While the service is available in the arcade for $6/hr, it makes more business sense to make it available throughout, even if it needed to be billed directly.

We had bought a one-bedroom suite three years ago and this was our first time back since then. We were amazed and really delighted at all the improvements, as the last time we were here the Grand Mayan pool complex was barely under construction. My husband sometimes has trouble walking because of a foot ailment, so about a month before we went I emailed the concierge and asked if we could be put in one of the Grand Mayan buildings close to the pool. While there were no guarantees, they said they would try, and when we checked in we were put in building 7, which is the one closest to all the restaurants and pools. It probably helped that we arrived early in the afternoon and got our request in before the majority of people arrived. We did have to wait, as our room was not ready, but were given a 25% off coupon to use in the Blue Fish snack bar, which we did. Our room, 3518, was on the top floor, close to the elevator, and had a lovely view of the lagoon and the pool complex. While we planned on doing some sightseeing, w ended up spending the entire week on the Grand Mayan property and never left once. We sat by the pool, my husband did a little work in the room (he is self-employed and can work from anywhere), and we ate at a different restaurant almost every night. This time, we met some people at the pool that we ended up spending time with during the week. That made the trip, especially for our daughter, even more enjoyable. We never missed going to the beach as the pool was spectacular. After reading other reviews from trip adviser, we went to Greenbreak, the restaurant on the gold course, a few times for breakfast and for lunch. They serve a full buffet or a continental breakfast (rolls, muffins, juice and fruit), which we particularly liked. They also serve a nice lunch. Their menu includes a Mexican version of the Rueben, which both my husband and I tried and enjoyed very much. The Greenbreak has a happy hour from 3:00 \u2013 5:00 p.m., but we never made it back for that. There is also a small glass enclosure outside the restaurant that houses a few baby crocodiles. Two were no longer than about six inches. Our other find was the Wine Bar, housed between the two more expensive restaurants, Tromonto and Gong. We met our new friends there a couple of evenings for happy hour (5:30 \u2013 6:30) and enjoyed some good wine and good conversation. However, when going to the wine bar, you have to ask for the happy hour 2 for 1 wine of the day. My husband went there early in the week, without knowing what to ask for it, and paid a fortune for a couple of glasses of wine. If you visit the wine bar, ask for Jose. He will remember your names right off and be sure that you get the happy hour wines. He was great! The Del Lago restaurant has buffet style eating for breakfast and for dinner, with a different theme for each night. They also have a small show there each night about 8:00 p.m. Thursday is their Mexican night, and while it is more expensive (about $60 a person), the fee covers all your food and drinks, including some types of liquor. We didn\u2019t go this year, but went last time and found the show enjoyable. My daughter and I spent a great deal of time at the Grand Mayan pool. As it was very hot, we often spent time in the water, cooling off. The water did get warm, but it was still refreshing. Happy hour every day at the pool is from 11:00 \u2013 1:00, but the drink of the day is 2 for 1 all day long. There is also a new pool snack bar called Blue Fish that had great guacamole, salads, and other items. There were waiters who came around the pool asking if you wanted anything, and got the food from there. You can also go and sit down in the snack bar itself to eat lunch. While we did notice that some tiles had come loose in the pool, there were constantly people in the pool cleaning it. In fact, the whole resort was very clean. They even wash the sidewalks once a day. As we were in a building close to the ocean, we did not notice mosquitoes, but did see that they spray for them every evening around 6:00 p.m. We ate out on the patio at Havana Moon, a restaurant right on the beach, and our meal was excellent. There is also a band there almost every night at 8:00 p.m. We were there for the rock and roll music night, but the next night was going to be salsa. My daughter and I also went to the Brio spa. I think bussiness has been slow, so we got a really good deal on a treatment, massage, and facial. I've been to several spas, and the service was great . We did go to the presentation, as we wanted to be updated on what was going on at the resort. While we hope to upgrade in the future, we were not able to now. We did see the new Grand Bliss and Grand Luxxe models, which are lovely, but are more than we need. Our presentation was really more like 3 \u00bd hours, and several people came to try to get us to upgrade now, but we were very firm. When the last person came, we were very honest, as was he. The slow economy has hurt this resort, along with most others, and they are not meeting sales quotas or being full to capacity. In the end, we got our 10% discount and 1,000 pesos off from our bill. About the food prices: if you are from a metropolitan area/suburb, as we are, the prices are about what we would pay at home. However, if you are from a small town, or an area with a lower cost of living, the food prices will seem high. If you go into Playa del Carmen, for a meal or two, the prices will be slightly lower. We did eat at Tromonto (northern Italian) one evening and the food was excellent, as always. Our daughter ordered take-out (at the wine bar) from Gong a couple of night, and while it was on the expensive side, she said it was very good.

I requested building 1 and that was exactly we we got. I am very glad that I did that because we were very close to everything. But I did use the golf carts to go to other buildings. As for eating at the resort we only at there three time out of our week stay, each time was good except the Del Largo with is the buffet. It wasn't that it was not good just had a lot of things that we didn't eat, drinks were very good. Like everyone else, yes the beach is not good but if you go out pass the rocks it is beautiful. WATER SHOES ARE A MUST if you are going to attempt to go in the water on the beach. FOOD: We went into Playa to shop for food because I cooked half of my stay, which was not so bad. We shopped at the MEGA because someone told us it was better than Walmart but I would recommend Walmart over The Mega. Walmart food looked fresher. Excursion: We did three trips - Xelha which was good but all day alot of walking but great snokeling. The girls really loved it. We did a timeshare presentation and received this as a gift which included a Tulum tour also. Inside the park the food and drinks were free which was very good. The food was very good. The girls went swimming with the dolphins at the Dolphin Discovery in Cozumel at a natural park. Since we were so close to Cozumel we just took the ferry over and a taxi to the park. It was beauiful there and snokeling was great there too. The girls enjoyed swimming with the dolphins they were in the water for about 45 minutes. Go early and on a Monday because no cruise ships come in on that day and it was less people which made it great. As for the snokeling there are some many fish you can rent a life vest and snokeling equipment for $10 and go on your own or you can bring your own. We went to Hidden World which was awesome. We snokeled in caves, ziplined through the jungle, zipline into the cenotes and rode a skycycle. This place was the girls favorite but one thing to remember BRING PLENTY OF BUG SPRAY. The mosquitoes were terrible but you are in the jungle. They have a small little resturant the food there was the best we had in Mexico it was great. We also went into Playa to the beach it was a great day but do go early so you will be able to rent chairs and umbrellas. We did a lot of back and forth into Playa so my only suggestion would be if you plan to go in to Playa to shop or the beach renting a car would be good. If you are not afraid to drive over there because the taxis are $20 each way can get expensive. TIMESHARE PRESENTATION: We actually did two I was a little reluctant at first because I read some many reviews about the presentations lasting for hours almost the whole day. But they told us 90 mins and they were 90 mins. We did one off the resort and with the Grand Mayan to receive 1000 pesos and 10% off our bill. It was will worth it.

Our first visit was in January, and we really enjoyed ourselves. Because the weather was so nice at the time, we played golf, visited the ruins in Tulum, and explored the area in our rental car. We felt that the resort was clean, service was good, and food prices were much more reasonable than the usually inflated resort prices. So we decided to make the trip again just last week. As expected, the resort was very clean. There are always employees mopping the floors or cleaning the windows. Also, housekeeping comes in to clean your room everyday (unlike other vacation ownership properties where we have stayed). There property is huge. We were lucky enough to stay in Building 1, which allowed us to walk to any of the pools/restaurants. However, some of the buildings are a good distance away from the pools, but you can ride the shuttle that comes around every 15 minutes. Staff members are very friendly and helpful. Most speak English, but there are some who do not. The main difference between our last stay and this stay was the heat! In fact, it was so warm that we opted to not do some of the activities that we usually enjoy (golf, exploring, etc.) and hang out in the pool. You can rent a covered palapa for $35/day, but that $35 goes toward any food/beverage purchases that day. So by the time we ordered lunch and a couple drinks from the pool restaurant, we basically got the palapa for free. A second negative...the mosquitos! We are still covered in mosquito bites, which was not a problem when we visited in January. The heat and mosquitoes probably are not legitimate complaints since it is summertime in Mexico, but I can legitimately complain about the internet situation. There is no internet access available in the rooms. There is a Cyber Cafe where you can use one of their 10 available computers at a personal work station, or you can bring in your own laptop. Internet service is basically prepaid, so you have to tell the Cyber Cafe worker how much time you want to purchase (30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.) and they will give you access to log onto the internet. Unfortunately, I had some work that had to be sumbitted while I was on vacation, so I sat down at a work station with my laptop plugged into a power outlet. Someone who did not have a laptop needed to use one of the house computers, so the Cyber Cafe worker asked me to move for him. I had no problem doing this, but I needed to keep my laptop plugged in. The worker informed me that if I needed a power outlet, I had to use one of the outlets outside on the patio. That's right, OUTSIDE in the heat with the mosqitoes!! Moral of the story...charge your laptop if you want to use the internet inside in the air conditioning!

We booked a hotel/air package at a reasonable rate which was the first plus. The service was great. Staff was very friendly and did extra services with a smile. When our afternoon maid came in to turn down the beds, she noticed that we set up 3 beds in the living room instead of two. After that she started doing it for us while we were out at dinner each night and would leave us hershey kisses. The accommodations were clean and well maintained and very comfortable. The pool at the nearby sister resort was huge and a lot of fun to play in. The walk from one resort to the next is maybe 5 minutes. There seemed to be plenty of pool chairs if you wanted one of those. The food was surprisingly good and reasonably priced for a resort setting. We ended up spending less on food than we thought we would. The only downside is that the hotel dollar/exchange rate is not as good as at a bank. But for the convenience of not going into Playa del Carmen or another town to exchange it was okay. We visited the Tulum and Chichen Itza ruins. Both were wonderful and definitely worth seeing. We rented a car to see Tulum which worked out great because we went to Xel Ha the same day. (Another fun activity. Also the restaurants there served very good food). The trip to Chichen Itza was with a tour and we would not recommend that because it took all day to drive there because the bus made stops at many other hotels and that added probably 3 hours to the ride. The tour was good though for giving information about the ruins. There might be guides on sight to do that though. One thing to remember when renting a car, their car sizes are really a step down compared to US sizes. We got a full sized car for 5 people because that would work at home, but it was a very tight fit.", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Illinois", "Title": "\u201cA Beautiful Resort, But Beware of the Timeshare Sharks\u201d", "Author": "GLS60", "ReviewID": "UR35125132", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the Grand Mayan Riviera Maya with three young adults during the week of July 11 through July 18, 2009. The resort was spectacular in every regard. We decided to go to their breakfast sales presentation that they state in writing lasts only 90 minutes. The price of the timeshare kept dropping, starting at just over $50,000 and, at the end of an exhaustive three hour high pressure squeeze, was down to just $9,500. We were told that we could be assured of renting out our timeshare each year for more than the total of our yearly payments. This sounded too good to be true so I told them that I would have to do my own research. They then showed us pictures of Jack Nicholas and Greg Norman, emphasizing that both men were doing business with Grupo Mayan and both had surely researched the company before agreeing to develop golf courses. Of course, they didn't tell us that either one of them had purchased a timeshare with Gruop Mayan. They kept handing us off to different sales people. Thinking that they had my wife sold and that I was the one who was preventing the closing of their sale, they sent an attractive female to our table who obviously had cosmetic surgury to her upper torso. Their tactics were so obvious that it was insulting. I refused to took at her. At one point she showed us a piece of paper that we could sign if were wished to decline their offer. I grabbed the paper and signed on the dotted line. Not having expected me to be so bold, she stood up with the paper and walked away. The high pressure sales storm was just beginning. The atmosphere became even more tense as they brought out Victor, the big gun. He started with pleasant small talk for about ten minutes and then, as he transitioned to his sales pitch, I could tell that we were swimming with sharks. He told me that I wasn't being a very good husband because he sensed that my wife wanted to purchase the time share, but I wouldn't let her. After first explaining that I didn't appreciate his \"divide and conquer\" tactics, I reminded him that we had never thought about buying a timeshare and, as a matter of caution, their representations seemed too good to be true so we would have to do our independent research. Victor then tried one of the most unethical ploys in the book. He angerly said, \"Well, I will have to speak with Jose (the first sales person that we encountered) because the only reason intelligent people like us would turn down such a wonderful opportunity was because he did not do a good job of explaining it to us.\" This came soon after he had fondly mentioned Jose's wife and three children by name. I could tell that my wife was upset with the idea that we were getting Jose into trouble so I said to her, \"Relax, that is just a sales technique.\" Victor assured us that it was not a sales technique. He then strong implied that he was insulted that we did not trust him. I responded by saying, \"Sir, we were told in writing that this presentation would last only 90 minutes. It has now lasted 215 minutes. That is the only thing that I have to go on to guide my judgement as to whether you are trustworthy.\" Victor stood up and said, \"Very well the sales presentation is over.\" He took us to a table where we were to sign up to receive the incentives that they had offered only to find that the young man at that table was waiting to make even more proposals at lower prices. I said, \"Victor told us that he sales presentation was over. Did he lie to us?\" Alas, we were finally free. I feel sorry for the people who reported staying for six and seven hours. I would strongly advise against going to their sales presentation. If you feel you must go, be sure that you have the capacity to be assertive, and if necessary, rude. Otherwise, you may well end up purchasing a timeshare just to escape. I have now done my own research. A simple google search reveals too many people complaining that they were misled by their sales staff for us to feel comfortable purchasing a timeshare there.", "Date": "July 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cHaving a rental car made this trip FABULOUS\u201d", "Author": "lillymay", "ReviewID": "UR34569674", "Content": "My husband and I stayed here the last week of May. Thanks to the swine flu, the resort was only at 30% occupancy instead of the usual 70%! It felt like we had the whole resort to ourselves. The GMRM was great for many reasons: The pools were amazing, especially the infinity pool overlooking the lagoon. The service and employees were top notch and super friendly. Our suite was simply fabulous, the only thing missing was a water view. On the other hand, the GMRM had a few drawbacks: The beach is not swimmable!! I read this in numerous reviews before going and decided that those reviews were probably wrong and if I was \"adventurous\" enough I could certainly swim there, not being deterred by some rocks. WRONG...really, you cannot swim at this beach and you have to walk almost a mile if you want to swim & snorkle. (This was a HUGE bummer to us but if you're a pool person it won't matter) There are ZERO Caribbean views unlesss you actually walk to the beach. Most buildings are seriously far from the pools and Sea. But we still had an amazing time. I highly recommend a rental car. The best part of our trip was all the day-tripping and exploring. The GMRM is just a short drive from numerous spots: 1. Our absolute favorite (when went 3 days in a row) was Akumal. We will stay in Akumal next time. It is totally secluded and totally beautiful. We ate lunch at \"La Vida Buena\" which is smack dab on the water (tables in the sand) and then used their private beach which had a pool, lounge chairs, hammocks, shower and bathroom. If you eat at La Vida Buena you have beach privielges there for the whole day. Amazing snorkling, too. The water is shallow until you get way, way out. 2. Don't miss Puerto Morelos. It has the best snorkling, but hire a guy to take you out. It was very cheap to take a boat out that took us to three snorkling locations. Restaurants and shopping here were very cheap too. It's so close to the resort, just about 10 ro 15 minutes north of GMRM. 3. Playa del Carmen. Go here is you like to party or if you like AMAZING food and people watching. Because there are so many tourists (cruise ships dock here) the restaurants are super inexpensive due to all the competition and the alcohol is so cheap it seems impossible. I highly recommend taking pesos b.c. they will not give you a good exchange rate for your American dollar. One night we wandered down to the beach to check out the full moon on the water and were totally suprised to find a quaint beach-front bar with live music and happy hour at 10 p.m. The closer you get to the ferry to Cozumel (almost all the way at the end of Avenida 5) the better...unless you like big crowds and lots of noise. We felt safe the whole time, even later at night. 4. Tulum...I loved it but my husband was so-so about it.

I was with my wife and two young kids (both under 10). I had read LOTS of reviews of this place before going, and had my doubts beforehand, so I'll say at the outset that although this hotel probably is a 5-star hotel by Mexican standards, you need to keep in mind that you are in Mexico, not NYC or LA or Miami, AND it is a megaresort which is involved in a heavy timeshare business. If you go there with the mindset that it will be the same as going to an exclusive hotel on the beach run by the Mandarin Hotel group or the Four Seasons, Peninsula hotels, etc., you will be sorely disappointed, and apparently some reviewers fall into that category. I have stayed at very fine hotels throughout the world, including in numerous developing countries, I'm fairly young and adventurous and my family and I can generally go with the flow, so although my expectations in general are high, I prepared myself in advance for a trip where timeshares would be pushed, Mexico is still Mexico and since it was a megaresort that emphasized selling timeshares, and not necessarily anticipating one's every need, as you would find at the finer (and smaller) hotels in the world, or course you won't get the 5-star Four Seasons treatment. That said.... Check-in day one: the hotel's FREE van picked us up as planned at the Cancun airport. No problems. Make sure you email the hotel concierge in advance to get a confirmation email re pickup. Note that the Grand Mayan does NOT provide free transport for the return to the airport. You can either go in their van again and pay US$15 pp, and others might join you in the van, or pay roughly the same for a taxi (available 24/7--call hotel operation to get you one about 10 min in advance), but regular taxis are smaller, so make sure it will hold all your luggage. A large taxi van is a total of US$ 60.00 (and I was told the kids were free), so I guess the extra $30 was just for the larger size. Upon arrival in beautiful and impressive hotel our bags were held by the bellboys upfront while we waited about 20 minutes in line in the lobby to check in. We had arrived at around 1:00 and like most mega hotels, this hotel had the unfair policy of a check-in of 5:00 pm., so we anticipated there would be some sort of wait. We had requested, and got, a room in bldgs 1-7, but it was still being cleaned. We were told it would be ready in about 90 minutes and were given a 25% off coupon for Blue Fish, the small restaurant right off the lobby at the Grand Mayan. We had a good lunch and some drinks and when we got back to the lobby were told our room was ready. Unfortunately our bldg 5 room reeked of mold (not surprising given that it was ultra hot and humid outside and the A/C was on high inside, but apparently the A/C is programmed for on/off throughout the day unless you change it, so LOTS of condensation builds up in the rooms, and this, combined with a decent number of overflowing jacuzzis (by guests) which I guess weren't cleaned properly afrerwards, led to the mold). The smell was so strong that we had to change rooms (some mold allergies in our family, and even without the mold allergies, we felt a hotel like that could do better than give us a moldy room...). It took a while waiting in moldy room #1 until we got another room, and while that room didn't have as bad a smell, it smelled a little and it was facing the hotel's laundry/electrical building and we had a nice, high pitched buzzing that we could hear even with all the doors closed. So...we got another room and that worked out perfectly. Unfortunately all the room switching, waiting for the bags, etc., took many hours and before we knew it, it was close to 9:00. It was a Sunday, and some of the restaurants had closed early, so we only had a choice of either room service or the Del Lago Italian buffet. We chose the buffet and got caught in a bad rain storm on the way over. There are FEW covered paths throughout the resort so either bring an umbrella or deal with getting wet during the frequent but short storms. Food was pretty mediocre see below). Note that the hotel complex is enormous and you will need some days to get your bearings. Everyone is correct when they say that you should stay in buildings 1-7. The other buildings are a bit of a walk and between the hot sun and frequent, sudden storms, you don't want to be out in the open so much, esp. with young kids. Also, the shuttles do NOT run on a regular schedule (they call it \"Mexican time\") and you can wait for a while. Over the next several days we hung out alot at the resort, checking out all the pools, restaurants, etc. Here are some tips: There are several happy hours at the hotel: 11-1 at I think all the pools offers 2 for 1 on almost all drinks. Note that a popular drink, the coco loco, is made inside a coconut and they resort always runs out of coconuts. The Grand Mayan pool though does have coconuts more often than the bar at the big pool at the Mayan Palace. When the 2 for 1 happy hour on any drink is over at 1:00, the next happy hour from 1 to 5 is on the drink of the day. 2 for 1 on that drink only until 5. After 5, I think Havana Moon restaurant and the wine bar above the Italian restaurant offer a late night happy hour of sorts. Don't bother with the kids club at the Grand Mayan. At this time of year there are few kids and even fewer activities. Go to the kids club at the Mayan Palace and do the stuff there. Re kids club, make sure to understand how this works. They call everything for kids the kids club, but in fact they have kids activities most of the day, either on the hour or half hour. Activities range from numerous arts and crafts to movies at night, crocodile tours, sports, etc. You will be told that it is not a daycare and you can't just leave your kids there. That is kind of true. You can leave your kids there but as any responsible parent you should frequently check up on them. We found that our kids wanted the independence of being there, meeting friends, etc. The club is outside, next to Balche restaurant and very close to the big pool. There are no fees for the activities. The other kids club is a glamorized day care with basically the same activities as the free kids club, but they will watch your kids all day, incl lunch. Cost is 250 pesos a kid and we never felt the need to do it. There are lots of souvenirs and \"pay\" handicrafts right near the kids club, plus hairbraiding, temp tattoos, etc. Bring cash (dollars or pesos) as this is one of the few things you cannot charge to your room. Also bring cash if you go to the Mexican fiesta if you want souvenirs there. Finally re kids club, they have two fun nights for kids--pirate night on wed. and camping on thurs night. Each from 5:30-9:30. 250 pesos per kid, incl dinner. Our kids loved both night and it gave us a great chance to have some time just the two of us. Hotel tells you that you shouldn't leave the hotel while kids are doing there party night and we listened. Other couples did go into Playa. We got palapas or pool chairs right near the kids club so that we could keep tabs on the kids. Speaking of the palapas (the palm fram covered beds with canopies near the pool), here's the deal. You reserve them early in the morning at a desk in front of the bar at Balche. Reservations open at 7:30 and by 8:30 most of the better located palapas are taken, so get there early. They'll show you a map of all palapas, which ones are available and you choose what you want. Cost is 350 pesos BUT they will apply this as a credit to your food and beverages from the pool bar. Make sure you check your bill when you check out of the hotel to make sure you get the credit. We initially didn't get it but they quickly changed the invoice to reflect multiple credits for the palapas. Most people go to Mexico for the sun, but it is SO hot that you will want some shade, and the palapas are great for that. Also, you don't want to eat in the heat, so we hung out on the pool lounge chairs and then went to our palapa to eat the food in the shade. I recommend saving pool lounge chairs directly in front of your palapa, that way it's easy to go back and forth and you can keep an eye on your stuff and your kids if they're resting there. Re pool towels, you will be given a towel card for each person in your group. The hotel is unnecessarily rigid about having the cards, not losing your towels, etc., so if you are going around the hotel grounds during the day, periodically check your chair to make sure you still have your towels. We noticed that after 5, towels would sometimes be collected from chairs even if you had personal effects next to the chair (so put something on your towel if you'll be away for a bit at that time of day). If your towel is taken you'll often do a bit of a song and dance with the pool towel person to get another towel (or card). Turn your towels in to get your cards back at end of day. If you are at any pool other than the Mayan Palace pool late into the evening, you won't find anywhere to return your towel so take it back to your room and return or exchange it the next morning. Re eating at pool, note that the heat quickly effects food, esp. fruit and veggies. Don't leave your food sitting for a while or you will meet Montezuma!! Walmart: we took the hotel free shuttle to Walmart our first full day and bought things. We had a 12 day trip so we bought quite a bit--too much. Best suggestion for Walmart if you are not extremely budget conscious is don't overbuy. In all likelihood you will eat few meals in your room. As for booze, we overbought on this one as well. The hotel doesn't let you bring coolers to the pool or beach (although we snuck a small cooler to the pool several days), and the ease of just ordering drinks at the pool (combined with the happy hours) puts you in a state of not using much of your own booze except at night before you go to dinner. We ended up giving quite a bit of alcohol away. The pool drinks are sweet and not that strong, so if you do bring booze to the pool, you're best off just bringing the pure alcohol to strengthen your drink, rather than making pina coladas in your room and bringing a cooler of them to the pool. Best things to buy at Walmart are snacks and water. You will get gauged for both at the hotel convenience store, \"Jade\". Walmart has a pretty decent exchange rate, so pay in US$ there and they give you your change in pesos at a good rate--much better than changing money at the hotel (currently 12 pesos/dollar). We also bought breakfast items at Walmart as we had breakfast in the room almost every day. Restaurants: we went to all of them. Prices are a less than what you would find at a 4-star big city hotel, so if you are familiar with those prices, you'll think the prices are fair. If you're from North Podunk, the prices will seem high to you so be prepared. Note that the kitchens have a 4-burner stove and a microwave, but no oven, so don't think you can save on $ by buying frozen dinners and put them in the oven.... Balche: pretty good bar and grill type food plus pizzas during day, simple but good Mexican at night. Try the grilled chicken and the shrimp--good! Havana Moon: good food, very spotty service. Avoid the heavy-set, older waiter (can't remember his name). He screws up the orders and doesn't care. Good seafood dishes there and pretty good ribs. Try to get a seat outside with a nice ocean breeze. Live music and dancing. Important note: one of the best cocktails at the hotel isn't on the bar menu, except maybe here--I can't remember-- but I had my first one here and discovered later that any bar can make them. It's a tequila based drink called a zasel hah (SP?). It's a mayan drink with tequila, oj, damiana (a mayan liquor), mango juice (i think) and cointreau (I think). Havana Moon is the only restaurant at night where you can get pizzas (room service delivers them too). Gong: the asian restaurant above Jade. Surprisingly good food, and also probably the priciest restaurant there. The mixed fried rice was very good, as was the Chilean sea bass. Tramonto: the Italian restaurant across the hall from Gong. Decent, but for the prices not a hell of a lot better than Olive Garden on steroids (no offense to you Olive Garden fans). The wine bar (which has quite a bit more than just wine) between gong and tramonto is quite nice and probably one of the better places to go with your signif other if you can be away from the kids for an hour or two. It looks like a combo of Mayan culture and a decent NYC lounge. Definitely go outside on the deck and check out the beautiful views of the pools lit up at night and have a drink/cigar there. Wish we had done that more often. Del Lago: the buffet restaurant that has the has live shows most nights. Mediocre food (when was the last time you had really good buffet food). We ate there for the Italian buffet and the Mexican fiesta on Thurs night. Mexican show was pretty decent, we didn't go to any other shows there. The restaurant is open air and feels like a greenhouse. Even with the large fans throughout the place, be prepared to sweat. Brio health bar: above the spa at Brio. Good breakfast smoothies. Creperie at Jade. Average crepes. Greenbreak: decent breakfast buffet right next to the golf course Misc matters: Jade: is the convenience store/giftshop/arcade/internet place. High prices but they have just about everything you could want. Keep in mind that although you'll pay more for something there than you would at walmart, add the price of transport to walmart and they even out. Kids arcade is expensive. Now we come to my BIG negative in the whole resort--the internet. No place can call itself a 5-star hotel without internet in the rooms, and this place not only has no internet in the rooms (whether wifi or cabled with an ethernet cable) but the internet time that you can buy at Jade is an adventure. If you have a laptop to keep in touch with your office, as I did, you can either buy your time (in one hour blocks) and sit outside Jade in the sweltering heat (with no fans) and hope to get one of the 7 table areas where you can plug your laptop in, or if you're really lucky and the indoor internet/computer cubby areas are not busy, you can plug your laptop into an outlet where they have the computers for internet use. However, if someone wants to use one of those computers, you are out of luck and will have to move out. I had hoped to write a \"live\" review from the hotel, but who wants to spend there daytime hours sweltering in the heat outside Jade typing. The lack of internet access made it VERY inconvenient to read up on current things to do in the area, make spur of the moment reservations, etc. Blackberrys are good for emails but if you want to do things on the web, check out tourist info, events, etc., you need reall internet access. On other vacations, we've always done this at night to make the most of our time. No such luck at the Mayan. By the way, other hotels in the area DO have it, so it's not a technical problem. Rental car: we rented through alamo at the hotel. Reasonable rates and we had no problems driving. We drove to Chichen Itza, Tulum, Playa, Xcaret and other random places. If you like flexibility, rent a car and just be smart when you drive. We found the tours offered by the hotel to be very expensive and take too much time because the tour vans would stop along the way to pick up other people. Area attractions: Aktun Chen: a great underground cavern/cenote with stalactites/stalagmites. They also offer a walk through the caves and ziplines, but we heard the cenote tour was the best and we weren't disappointed. I think our guide's name was Juan and he was great. Give yourself about 2 hours. Find directions in your guide book. Whole family had an amazing experience. Selvatica: this is the best place for the ziplines. We did the extreme canopy tour which included the zips and the cenote. Lots of fun. They'll tell you they don't allow cameras on the tour but bring your own disposable camera and keep it in your pocket to avoid the ridiculous fees they charge for the \"professional\" pictures they take of you. Close to hotel near Puerto Morelos. Chicen Itza: you have to go--whether by car or tour bus. We drove via the new toll highway outside Cancun and returned via the road to Coba which ties into the 307 near Tulum. Chichen Itza is everything they say it is. When we got near the turnoff for it we saw an \"official information\" booth. We were given a map and offered lots of packages for admission, a guided tour, lunch, etc. We opted for the package which just included parking and a guided tour and were very happy with it. You have to pay on the spot even though you have to drive another 15 minutes before you get to where you need to go, and we had our doubts we were being ripped off, but in the end the guide was great. It is stifling hot there, with no ocean breezes. Bring a backpack with LOTS of water and unless you want to waste time with a heavy lunch which could cause problems later in the day, just pack snacks to maximize your time. We did that and by 3:30 we were on our way back. Since we took the Coba highway to Tulum, once we hit the 307 we decided to check out some other beaches on the way back to the Mayan. We stopped in Akumal and loved it. It's a series of resort hotels (which we didn't even see) but also a turnoff for the beach which leads you down a road full of bed and breakfast type hotels and really cool restaurants and bars. We stopped at a place called La Buena Vida and loved the food and atmosphere, right on the beach. They even have tree houses where you can drink, looking out over the beach and the area. Xcaret was ok, but not amazing. We did like the underground rivers there very much. Th \"great\" light show at night was good but long and hot and the kids got bored toward the end. Historical liberty was taken in re-telling Mexico's history. Tulum was great and we got some great pix at the ruins. We also drove parallel to the beach where all the small hotels are, checking out Mezzaine and La Zebra. Had great food and drinks during twilight at La Zebra and highly recommend that. Playa: don't get sucked into just staying a near end by beach where they have Carlos and Charlies and Sr. Frogs. Go to opposite end of 5th Ave. for better stores, restaurants and bars. We saw many that were nice. There's a cheap parking lot near 5th Ave near Carlos and Charlies. Ask hotel concierge for exact address. Pay for piece of mind and get all the Mexican car insurance that is offered. Even with a \"fancy\" amex card, I was told by both Alamo and Amex that my coverage was limited in Mexico, and you don't want to be in an accident there. Our daily rate for insurance was more than the car itself but it was worth it. Timeshares: on day one they'll give you a form and tell you to schedule an appt. to take the \"90-minute\" tour. I have timeshares and these things are never 90 minutes. Since I knew I wasn't going to buy anyway and I wasn't desperate for the money, I didn't do the tour. Had I done it, I would have received discounts on all hotel tours (none for us since we wanted to drive ourselves and do things our way), 1,000 pesos cash and 10% off our final invoice. Still, for us it wasn't worth losing half a day. Activities: check the schedule you will be given for adult and kid activities and plan your hotel days accordingly. There are some fun activities you won't want to miss. Also, if you go to the beach, as prev. said, the water is not ideal for walking/swimming due to the rocks/reef. Still, the sand itself is nice and a good place to grab at chair and look at the ocean. if you are on the beach facing the ocean, look to the right and there are water sports (not through the hotel) where you can rent waverunners, go snorkeling from a boat or go parasailing. We also went into Puerto Morelos one day, rented a guide and boat and went snorkeling in the great reef. I was fantastic. Had lunch at a seafood place oceanside and it was good (the place across from the ocean near the tour/snorkel kiosk). Bring LOTS of Off (incl the kind mixed with sunscreen) and afterbite. You will need this stuff everywhere except outside your room, where insecticide is in full force. We got LOTS of bites even with the Off.

I was there from June 21, 2009 to June 28, 2009 on my honeymoon. It's definitely paradise. My husband and I wanted to pretty much sit by the beach/pool on our honeymoon and we got what we wanted here, except we felt like we were in the lap of luxury! But for those of you who want things to do, there was plenty of that as well. We booked our trip 7 months prior through my aunt's time share. At the time I booked, I had absolutely no clue what we were in for, so I started reading the comments on tripadvisor. I found some things very useful, so I wanted to give some tips or my own. First, the Grand Mayan is different than the Mayan Palace. They are the same company and they are located on the same resort, but their rooms & lobby are different (they fall under GrupoMayan) When you stay with The Grand Mayan, you have access to everything the Mayan Palace does and actually a little more. We stayed at The Grand Mayan. A great tip that I'm glad I read about before I went. On the resort, you do not use cash. When you check in, they ask you for a credit card to hold $8000 pesos for your stay. Anytime you want to purchase food, anything at the shop, spa, etc., you give them your room number and your last name (sometimes they will confirm your signature) and they will put it towards your room. At the end of your stay, when you check out, they will give you your total bill to look over and if everything is ok, you can pay them by cash, credit card and I think check. At night, they have street vendors selling cigars, spray paint art, etc. and those you will need cash for. It's very true that this place is big and that the higher number building you stay in, the further you are from everything, but we personally wanted to stay far because we wanted to be away from the busy area. We stayed in Building 10 (The Jungle). I think the last building in the resort is building 12. I didn't really see a need for a rental car unless you were going off the resort. Even though the buildings were further from everything, I didn't think that walking was too bad. It's not that far that you can't enjoy a nice walk. Also, there are shuttles that bring you back and forth to place you want to go. And we personally had no problems with them. Each of the shuttles have a different color flag on them because depending on the color, they bring you to different places. For example, if it had a white flag, it brought you to the lobby & the jungle. We took them often and we never had a long wait. At most, we probably waited 10 minutes for one. (and that's pushing it). As for food, we loved it! The only place that we didn't care too much for was \"Del Lago.\" It's a buffet style restaurant and the food wasn't always the best. You can get much better. We pretty much ate at every restaurant, except Havana Moon. I really recommend the Fish Tacos & the Shrimp Tacos at Blue Fish. The staff was wonderful. Extremely helpful and very friendly. I recommend carrying some cash on you for dinner because the gratuity that is included on the big is nothing compared to the service you get. We would give them a little extra. I could go on and on about this place!! It was so beautiful and so relaxing, we didn't want to leave. If you have made it to the end of my post, Thank you! and I hope I helped!

I read the other reviews and can't help but wonder about some of them. Some people will find anything to criticize. Each time we have been there we did the timeshare thing...and yes it took the better part of the day and yes we bought and upgraded and we have no regret. You don't have to sit there for hours if you don't want to....you stand firm and say no and they will sigh you off for your discounts and you are on your way. Location....yes it is a trip to town but hey....when you are home and want to go somewhere you have to drive to get there. There was a group of five if us and we wanted to beach club hop and shop so instead of relying on taxis or buses we hired a driver for the day. He picked us up at 9:00am and took us wherever we wanted to go...waited for us and then took us to the next place etc and we were back at our room that night at 9:00pm. We could leave our stuff in the van when we went somewhere and felt safe doing so. $200 we thought was a deal. We did the same thing the 2 times we went before. It was the way to go. He was at out beckon call Other than that when you visit a resort like this you are not suppose to be on the go 24/7. Spend a day and just lounge by the many pools....enjoy the poolside service and the surroundings....you are on vacation for gosh sakes. Rooms....Large. We stayed in a 2 bedroom Grand Mayan Suite. More than enough room without getting in each others way. Double sinks in the bathroom and there were 4 women. No problems. Very large patio area with chaisse lounges and chairs and tables and a plunge pool that felt so good after a day at the beach in the sun. Full kitchen with refrigerator, 4 burner stovetop, microwave, coffeemaker, I don't remember if there was a small oven or not as all we used was the fridge. Food....the restaurants are wonderful. People complain about prices...you are going out to eat what do they expect. They are not outrageous. There are 6 \"restaurants\" and a store where you can purchase food. You can also stock up on food with a trip into town. Again....you are at a resort on vacation not at home. If you want that kind of vacation...rent a house. Also....24 hour room service. Quick and good and very attentive The resort is changing and things are being added...in the 4 years since we were first there it has only gotten better. Someone will always find something to complain about no matter where they stay....We will be back at least once a year for many years to come. It is relaxing, peaceful, beautiful, quiet, clean.... the staff is gracious, friendly and very accomodating to you needs. If you want night life and don't mind a lot of people...stay in Cancun with thousands of other people or Playa which is not as crowded but growing. If you want the best of both stay at the Grand Mayan and take a taxi into town. So many beautiful beaches and things to see all within a 90 minute drive. If you have kids...the resort has a lot of activities for kids. They will not be bored. Yes the resort is large and if you are in one of the far buildings it is a walk to the pools or restaurants etc.......but they have the carts that are always shuttling people back and forth. We never waited longer than 10 minutes....and so what. We talked to other people and didn't find it annoying or a pain to wait. The pools are plentiful and yes they were a bit warm but what do you expect in 90 degree weather with 90% humidity. They are still refreshing and clean and a pleasure to get into. Many have lounging beds and no they are not deep but they are not to dive in anyway. There are a lot of spots in the pools where they have walls that you can lay on as well. Great pools.... The people staying in the Grand Mayan have access right now to all the pools. There are 2 Grand Mayan pools.The newest Grand Mayan pool is just beautiful. It is very Zen like and so peaceful. There are a lot of comfy chairs and lounges all around the pool. The large pool that is available to everyone, Mayan Palace and Grand Mayan guests is just that....LARGE. There are many different areas of that pool with lots of chairs and palapas that you can reserve to just spend the day in...eating, drinking, sleeping, it is just great. Alsoa lot of places on the beach to sit back and enjoy the breeze off the water. They are adding another section that will be exclusive like the Grand Mayan is now....those people in the Grand Bliss and Grand Lux will have their own pools/beach area when it is complete as well as access to the rest of the resort. I will stop now because I could go on and on....Go and enjoy yourself...Take it for what it is and don't nitpik about every little thing. You are on vacation and life is to short to find fault in every little thing. The Spa is great also...They have a large spa menu and workout area. Tthe only thing missing according to my son in law was a billiards table. To those people that complain about the heat....my gosh you are in an area that gets hot and humid. If you can't stand the heat....don't go south of the equator. It is hot and it will be humid.

We all had a great time exploring the area around Playa del Carmen and relaxing around the pool. Here are a few bits of info for fellow travelers. -The Grand Mayan is very large and spread out. Be prepared to walk! It is also very hot and humid in the Yucatan especially in the summer. We didn't mind it too much and enjoyed the exercise. It does take some time to learn the layout of the place. The buildings are all 3 stories or fewer, which leaves you with very few landmarks to guide you around. -Bring mosquito repellent! There are lots of mosquitos at the resort and we all got bit quite a few times. When you are in the jungle, expect to be bitten!! -We knew the hotel was about 20 minutes from town and decided to rent a car, which turned out to be a great decision. We drove the speed limit and had no problems with the police. The speed bumps are a bit much, but you kind of get used to them. -Playa Carmen is a cute little town and has a great shopping area along the beach called 5th Avenue. We ate several times there and shopped. We also went shopping at Walmart for breakfast and lunch items, a necessity unless you want to eat out for every meal. -Xel'Ha and Xcaret are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone. We bought tickets online and saved quite a bit of money doing so. Both places are off the main highway and are easy to get to by car. The Yucatan has some amazing natural wonders, as well great historical interests. -We ate dinner at the hotel once (the Cuban themed one on the beach). We ate outside and the food was very good and also reasonable. There was also live music and dancing. -The crepes were amazing at the Creperia (located in the store). -There is no wifi access in the rooms, only at the store. -The rooms are beautiful and large. Take advantage of the spa tube! The kitchen has basic necessary implements. There are no ocean views, which was different from our experience at the GM Puerto Vallarta. I was mildly dissapointed not to see the ocean right out our room. -The pools are beautiful, but a bit warm for my taste. We have a 2 year old who loved the one with the beach sloped entrance. Poolside service is good and the food is decent. We took advantage of the 2 for 1 daily drink special. The poolside beds are also fun. -The ocean directly in front of the hotel is difficult to swim in due to the last hurricane that came through a few years ago and exposed the coral. It is still beautiful and you can walk a short distance to a swimable area. Overall this is a great place to stay. Like any place there are pluses and minuses.

Hike to the store, and hope a computer is available or sit outside with your own. Restaurants, good food, but you will pay big $$ and remember if you don't eat there be prepared for a 1/2 hour excursion to get your car and drive to Playa Del Carmen or longer for Cancun. I don't golf but if I did It was way too hot. and humid while I was there. To make my point... we went to see the Mayan ruins at one location and were scheduled to go to others on the next day but 5 out of 6 backed out due to the heat. The workers are humble and great people that obey the rules of this money machine to keep thier jobs. I tipped them constantly and it made my trip. What service.

A little tightening up in Tramonto with regard to communication between the managing staff would be good though. One night decided to have lobster for five and the price was quoted per person but changed the next night after I received the check. Was not happy about that but other than that one incident in 8 days we enjoyed every minute of our stay. One other consideration minor although it may have effect, the room we had a musty odor even with the air on full and the fans going.

The staff is very friendly all the way from the grounds keepers to the concierge. There are yards and yards of connected pools and poolsides with lounges in and out of the water. The white sandy beach is a few hundred yards long and has lounges in and out of the shade. The waitress will keep your drinks full during the two-for-one happy hours which last daily from 11:00 \u2018til1:00. Our room was magnificent! The master bedroom was spacious with a sitting area and a large round soaking tub and a king size bed with adjoining shower, lavatories, and facility, An additional lavatory led to the kitchenette, dining area and living room which separated the master bedroom from the second bedroom. The second bedroom had its own room entrance with shower, etc., There was also a large water jetted tub with four louvered doors that opened into the second bedroom which was furnished with a king size bed and a small living area. The two bedrooms and the living room opened onto a large balcony which sported a small, refreshing, private swimming pool and looked out over what appeared to be the canopy of the jungle. All in all it was a magnificent place and we were treated like kings throughout our entire stay. We were look after constantly with twice a day maid service. The evening maid service was an inquiry to see if we needed clean towels or trash removal. There were negative aspects which started at the beach. Where the white sandy beach meets the water it becomes a craggy obstacle course of rocks that will put even the highest of quality water shoes to the test. Do not come here if you are planning to spend your days snorkeling and swimming in the sea. You can swim but you will not be running in and out of the water. The snorkeling is quite fruitless unless your forte is sea urchins and zebra snails. If you book a diving trip at the dive shack be sure you know who you will be diving with. We spent $80 each to dive with three students doing open water dives for PADI certification so we did not get below 45 feet on a two-tank dive which was not much more than a glorified snorkel trip. On our second dive the students had reached the limit of the required underwater time so we had to surface with half the air left in our tanks. Pay the extra money for the ferry ride to Cozumel, get a cheaper dive, and enjoy the real undersea flora and fauna experience. If you are not spending the entire time on the resort keep in mind you are about 40 minutes from Cancun and about 20 minutes from Playa. The ferry to Cozumel is in Playa and takes about 30 minutes to cross. You might want to rent a car if you plan on shopping and sightseeing much. The resort offers scheduled shuttle rides to Wal-Mart in Playa for 40 pesos per person one way or you can take a cab for 200 pesos one way and go anytime you want or you can take your chances and jump the public transportation right outside the resort gate for 15 pesos. They may or may not have room for your entire party. The resort also offers bus tours to many sightseeing destinations. We hired a local guide who we found out about through the TA forum and has a web page at www.cancunwithme.com. The worst part of the Grand Mayan experience is the timeshare octopus. If you can get through it it will save you money. For a $10.00 refundable reservation fee we were told we could enjoy a free buffet breakfast. It was complimentary and we could leave the sales presentation anytime since we were already RCI members. Not so! Knowing Mexico has a five day right to rescind law, after five hours and about five different sales pitches by supervisors of supervisors, just to get out of there we signed on the line and, as soon as we arrived home, we sent in the paperwork to exercise our right to get out of the contract. Hopefully they will give our money back without a big fight. By going through the sales pitch we received 1000 pesos credit on our bill, a 10% reduction of our total bill, a free buffet for our family of four, a bottle of Kahlua, and our $10.00 back. They also told us they were going to pay the maintenance fees on our current ownership and they would get our money back for the lousy scuba dive but we knew they wouldn\u2019t follow through on either of those promises and they didn\u2019t. All-in-all we enjoyed our stay at the Grand Mayan. We will not go back because we always go to a different place each year but we would recommend it if you are looking for a week of total relaxation and pampering. One final note, they pick you up at the airport free if you call them two days in advance. However, you are charged $15 US per person to be shuttled back to the airport. For $55 US per day you can rent a car with all the insurance available and no deductible. So, if there is more than four in your party it might be worth renting a car to get back to the airport. Enjoy your stay! It is fun go ahead and let them pamper you!", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "virginia", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Vacation!!!

I LOVED IT! The resort is really big, so tthey have shuttles/golf carts going at all hours to get people places around the resort. That was really nice! You can still walk though, with all the food and drinks you'll be having, its nice to burn some calories! The pool areas are AMAZING. So beautiful. The beach is nice, but the water is rocky, so you wont be in there too much. But its still nice to wade in the ocean. The restaurants are AMAZING. We ate SO well. I reccommend the Italian restaurant!!! And of course, the guac was to DIE for!!! I also reccommend taking the shuttle to PLaya Del Carmen one day - do some shopping and lay on the beach. We did two excursions and they are definitely worth it. Those were our favorite days. You can pay in cash - but be ready to convert from peso's to dollars at every meal unless you want to just charge it to your room instead. Here's what I will say could be better - there isnt much of a nightlife in the resort. However, with that said - you can take a taxi into Cancun or Playa. Or just a relazing week is always nice.

We did read some reviews about money exchange and wanted to wait to do it at a local bank and I think it was a very bad desicion.. change it at the international terminal right before getting out the airport. There were so many transportation guys asking where you were gonna stay.. a little anoying but just, say, there's somebody waiting for me outside, IF THAT'S YOUR CASE. Make sure what T-shirt color is your (cortesy or pre-paid) transportation guide is going to be wearing because even for me, that my native language is Spanish, was a little confusing. Finally we got our free transportation to the Grand Mayan lobby... everybody treated us like royalty.. and all the people was telling us the impact that the \"flu season\" had in the area. We decided to go because we thought it was safe... more people die yearly from normal flu.. anyway... THE GRAND MAYAN ARRIVAL: The lobby looked pretty empty but everyone with a smile greeting you and helpfull about anything. We had a Mayan Palace suite reservation, but since they were anormally low (some said that 5% occupancy) we asked for an upgrade and they didn't hesitate to do it. They were not going to sell that suite anyway... so it was around 12.30 pm and they said that the room wasn't ready.. check-in time is at 5pm, but she said that one of the rooms of our suite was going to be ready in 45 minutes, so we went to eat lunch at the \"Greenbreak\" Golf course restaurant... exqusite food for breakfast or lunch... we ate there a couple of time and we loved it ! the view amazing... the staff makes you feel at home. We went to our suite and decided to change and go to walmart to get groceries (there's transportation available from and to the hotel) ask concierge for the schedule paper. So we did groceries and went back... take it easy , I wouldn't recommend to do it the arrival day because could be very tireding.... Our friends (that invited us) we're arriving at 6.pm so we ended having dinner right next to the pool at the Frida's (mayan palace area) pretty price but very good... remember is a luxory resort. We stayed 6 nights... and believe me.. even if half of the restaurants and activities weren't available.. We really enjoyed our time, it was very pleasant and relaxing.. is very easy to talk to people and make friends and organize a volley ball match.. or stay away from the crowd and find a quiet spot to relax with your husband (or wife). TRIP TO CHICHEN ITZA PURCHASED AT THE GRAND MAYAN: You have everything... if you feel like taking a tour.. you have a travel agent at the lobby, we took the Chichen-Itza tour all inclusive (110 USD PER PERSON) and it really was amazing.. it worth it!!! it was very nice, even if you have (not always, depends on the day) to stop 3 or 4 times at other resorts on the way picking people up.. they make it very comfortable.. they played an info documentary about the Mayan civilization on the way there and offered continental breakfast... we stop at the Blue Cenote where we swam and took wonderful pictures and had lunch (buffet part of the all inclusive) and a few margaritas... later we continued our tour to the ruins.. the information from our guide was very good... not to long, just the right time, for later leave you on your own and enjoy yourself. on the way back, we watch a movie (August Rush very good!) and had open bar!! Rum, Tequila, Vodka, beer.. very good! THE RESORT OVERALL: I don't know if it was because the \"flu season\" but we always went to the Pool Bar 1 located at the Mayan palace area (Aquiles & Roni bartenders so nice persons) very nice people , very nice and high class resort.... you know, you find other kind of people everywhere but overall I can say that you feel very good and comfortable all the time. ABOUT THE ROCKY BEACH: Yes, the beach is not very nice to swim.. but believe me... you won't care... you can still enjoy being under a \"palapa\" and have a nice reading time there or just relax with the waves sound... The offer a sunday 12.00 catholic mass... they have a tent ready at the beach facing the ocean and is really spiritual and relaxing... do it if you have time. ONLY ADVICE: If you're staying a week or longer.. I would take advantage of the kitchenette it has everything, cookware, silverware, glassware, corkscrew, I mean everything. Microwave, toaster, coffee maker (bring or buy your own coffee they just supply the first day) That way you can save a lot of money.... we did get some groceries but didn't know that we had everything to cook with etc because when our room (side of the suite) was ready, the kitchen & livingroom was closed. So , go to walmart or the resort also has a little supermarket where you can find a lot of thiings too..such as eggs, milk, juice, salsas, tortillas, chips, fruit, water, lunch meat, bread etc.. more expensive than walmart of course but if you don't feel like going into walmart, it's ok to buy there, MUCH better than just eating at the Resort Restaurants. (BE CAREFUL, ORDER ROOM SERVICE ONLY IF YOU JUST DO NOT FEEL LIKE GOING OUT) We paid for one large 2 toppings pizza 30 USD. not to mention that other night we ordered 1 appetizer and 1 order of tacos and was like 40USD after a few tequilas you don't care but we could have avoided that if our pantry was full. LOL. THE MASTER SUITE: What can I say.. It was more than I was expecting... We stayed at the \"little room\" they're all connected.. you have the little room, the kitchenette with tall table and bar chairs for 4 a believe, the fridge is bigger than I thought, it's bigger than the regular minibars.. a half size regular fridge I'd say. the living room has 2 sofas, (every room is connected to the balcony that has a little pool ) and then you have the main room.. both rooms have a jacuzzi in it ! They supply first quality toilettries (just bring conditioner with you if you need it) I guess I said a lot LOL EXPLORE THE RESORT: Visit the crocodiles area and the flamingos, is a nice walk. there's Iguanas that you are able to see sometimes too! Do not miss if you have time, Playa del Carmen a nightime romantic walk thru 5th avenue!!! Amazing!!! HOPE YOU FIND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL! Enjoy the best coast in the world!!!

We did eat at most of the restaruants on the resort, and I really thoght the prices were reasonable. We had heard that the resort was huge, and that calling in advance and requesting a lower room number would be helpful. We did that, but they booked us in building 12. We requested a closer room again at check in, and we were bumped up to Building 1. I suggest doing the same so you will be closer to the action. I also recommend taking the local shuttle into Playa del Carmen. If you leave through the main gate, just walk across the street and stand on the road until a shuttle picks you up. It is a few dollars cheaper each way. We booked a trip to Tulum and Xel Ha, but the government closed the ruins due to the swine flu. We ended up spending more time on the beach at Playa, opting to rent beach chairs for the day. Take advantage of the fresh fruit near the beach, and enjoy one of the tortas from a street vendor. The tortas were about $1.50 and some of the best food we had the entire trip. We also booked a snorkel/scooter package in Cozumel. We booked this trip for about $60.00 total, with that covering snorkeling for 2 and a 6 hour scooter rental. We rode the scooter all around the island and saw beautiful beaches for miles. I highly recommend taking your scooter to Alberto's on the beach where you can get authentic nachos and killer mahi mahi. The beach at the resort is not impressive for swimming at all. I recommend the beach at Playa for swimming. Stick to the resort pool. The rooms were goregous, the staff was great. The swine flu scare really kicked into high gear when we were there, but we took advantage of the cheaper prices since people were cancelling their trip.

Watch for the drink special of the day, 2 for 1's and change daily. In general, the food is mediocre - we enjoyed the restaurant located at the beach the best. They do have a general store; we bought a 6 pack of MX beer and it was $17 USD - plan to do your shopping elsewhere if you plan to eat and cook your own meals in your room. Of course it will cost you $4/person each way to go to Wal-Mart on the shuttle (which comes every 2-3 hours) to Play del Carmen and if you want to take a cab back with all your groceries that's gonna be another $20. This hotel is not near anything - its a half hour to Playa del Carmen and even further back to Cancun. Not a problem if you don't have any intention of going anywhere else. The hotel is enormous and you have to walk everywhere (and bring a map, getting lost is easy), it didn't bother us - but I could see how it could be a problem for some. There aren't any ocean views, you could probably manage to never see the ocean while you are there unless you make a point to head down to the beach, which is rocky and just awful anyways.

I thought that I would use this review as a chance to compile the best tips I received from TA and put in my two cents the resort. What would have been a wonderful vacation either way was made exponentially better by knowing what to expect from the resort ahead of time. Some things to keep in mind on my review: my family traded a timeshare to come here, so we did not pay a daily rate for GM, so cost of the resort itself was not an issue for us, so GM versus Mayan Palace was a no brainer. If you can, go to the GM; it is worth it to have the extra pools and the wonderful rooms with the big balconies. Also, this was my first time at a large resort like this, so I do not have any other luxury resorts to compare GM to. My first tip: Before you go, request buildings 1-7. This is a common tip on here, but it is worth it to mention again. Also, if you can, get a room on either the 2nd or 3rd floor. Many people use the first floor hallways to walk through to escape rain/the hot Mexican sun, so it can be a little noisy as the hallways echo heavily. We were on the second floor of building 6, and it was a great location. We checked out the alligators every day on the way to the pool, and it was a 5-10 minute walk to get to the GM pools, Jade Boutique, etc. If you can't get this first few buildings, it is not the end of the world. I went for a walk on the last day, and walked from my building on the GM property to building 21 on the MP property and round trip (with a stop at Jade to pick up breakfast) and it took me 45 minutes total. Also, we took a golf cart tram ride the last day (which is what the shuttle is) and it was so fun! We were actually a little sad we missed out on it. But with all the eating we did (and poolside bar drinking) we were glad to have a little bit of walking mixed in to our day. I usually went out of my way to walk more around the property than was necessary because it was so beautiful and the weather was so nice. Another tip that is common that you should absolutely follow is DO NOT DO THE TIMESHARE PRESENTATION. We did not, and we could see the suffering of those who did. Be careful, because after you check in you will be handed off to someone who will give you very valuable information about the resort and smoothly segue into signing you up for the timeshare breakfast. My parents almost fell into the trap, but I picked up on it and stayed firm but polite with my no. We received one call after that asking if we would like to reconsider, but that was it. Our vacation was much better for it. My next tip: do not hesitate to ask for anything! The service here is unbelievable, every staff member is there to help. The maids do not speak much english, and many of the groundskeepers do not, but for the most part the staff speaks excellent English. Luckily my college-age brother speaks a little Spanish, so my family was able to communicate with them. The first thing we did when we arrived in our room was call for room service and for egg crates for the beds. The beds are very firm, and the egg crates made a huge difference. I stayed in the living room on the sofa bed, and the sofa beds are actually softer! I slept really well on mine, and since we had maid service twice a day, the turn down service maid would make mine up every evening. I was pretty giving with my tips on the resort and we made sure to tip the morning and evening maids, and I was very glad I did. One day I was there while the maid cleaned, and it took her an hour and a half to clean our 2 bedroom suite! Suddenly 50 pesos didn't feel like enough. I would say make sure to keep a lot of single dollars or 20 and 50 peso notes with you; the employees will be endlessly grateful and exceptional service somehow manages to get even better. Next tip: Get up early and go see the sunrise! The resort is beautiful and so quiet at this time, and seeing the sun rise out of the gulf of Mexico was incredible. It is also the ideal time to take those professional looking shots of the pools. The beach is still very rough, but I was able to wade out to at least knee deep without any water shoes. The beach is definitely getting sandier, and that is thanks to the (very cool looking) artificial reef that is out near the end of the pier. I highly recommend you walk out to the end of the pier to see it; the reef looks like a series of mini volcanoes. Honestly, I didn't spend much time at the beach because I was so busy exploring all of the pools; it took my family almost the whole week just to check them all out! For us, the best pool was the main Grand Mayan pool that is between the lobby and the Jade boutique. We were there the end of April into the beginning of May and we had no problems getting chairs every day. There was absolutely no need to go out early and reserve chairs. If you want a bed by the GM pool, you should probably head out earlier in the day, but we showed up late morning every day (around 11 am) and never had a problem finding a chair. A little tip that I did not know going in: beds at the Grand Mayan pools are FREE. You only have to pay for the beds by the Mayan Palace pool. We stayed on resort for most of the trip and really regretted renting a car for the week. My dad said that if he could do it again, he would not have rented a car for the week, but done it by the day at the resort, as we only did one day trip. We also made a trip to Wal-Mart, which for us was a huge waste. Even after going to Wal-Mart, we ended up running to Jade for a pastry etc. most mornings, so it wasn't even worth the trip. It ended up being a half day ordeal, and the prices were not so extraordinarily cheap as to merit losing vacation time. We could have bought pretty much everything we got at Jade, as they have a small grocery store as well as deli and bakery in there. It was also unsettling as we were there during the first days of swine flu frenzy and all of the employees (and a few of the shoppers) had masks on. In conclusion, if you are going to make the majority of your meals in your room, make a trip here (or to Mega Mart, that looked nicer than Wal Mart). We ate out mostly anyways, and it was a waste of time for us. Our one trip that we did make was to the Tulum beaches. I HIGHLY recommend this! Tulum has the most beautiful beaches I have ever seen! We started by eating at Que Fresco, a restaurant at a little beach resort called Zamas that is near the start of the line of hotels and cabanas that line the beach. After, we went down the road a ways to Ana y Jose's, which I had read reviews of ahead of time and knew that they had good amenities by the standards of these little beach resorts. One thing to note is that these little properties do not have the great plumbing and standards of the big hotels, so you cannot throw your toilet paper in the toilet for any reason, they have separate trash receptacles for that. Ana y Jose apparently has bus tours that stop at the property, which is why their changing rooms etc. are so nice, so be aware that if you see a tour bus, it will be crowded there. The day my family went there were maybe five other people on the property with us. Walking the beach and playing in the waves was the best part of my whole vacation, and there are miles of uninterrupted white sandy beaches down here! The biggest letdown of the trip was when we finished our day at the beach and headed to the Tulum ruins to find out...they were closed. Because of Swine flu. And we had missed seeing them by a day! (I believe they were reopened a week later. Talk about bad timing!) Even with the closed ruins, it was worth the hour trip down there for that stretch of beach. It is THAT nice. For food at the Grand Mayan, my favorite restaurant was Frida's. We at at all of the restaurants except Gong, and all the other food was good, but Frida's was the one place I thought the food was great. I also loved the sandwiches and crepes you could get in Jade, and the bakery section is dangerous it is so good. The chips and guacamole that I got by the pool were also the best I have ever had, and I love chips and guacamole, so that is saying a lot. I would say most of the restaurants ended up costing about $20-25 dollars a person for our group, and that was for an entree and 2 drinks per person, with the exception of Tramanto. Tramanto came out to be about $200 for our group and honestly, it just wasn't worth it. I would say the consensus of our group was that the food was okay, but it did not merit the higher prices. They do have 2 for 1 drinks from 5-7, so maybe head for a cocktail there. We also did the buffet at the Del Lago a couple of times, which I would have personally have skipped. The breakfast was pretty good, but I don't know if it was worth the $25 price tag, and I thought the evening show we went to (the Deep Blue) was a little...ridiculous. But that is just my opinion. The rest of my family really liked it. There were some acts that were really cool, but parts of it were really kitschy. I hear the Mexican fiesta is the night to go, and I passed through during the Ancient night and that looked like a good show also. I guess it all depends on what you find entertaining. That brings us to...the pool bars! My brother and I spent a fair amount of time at these as we are 19 and 24 respectively, and it is very wise if you are going to do the same to take advantage of happy hour and the drink special of the day, as they are 2 for 1. I highly recommend buying a Pai-Ai, as they are so much fun! I think it was 115 pesos, and you get an adorable pineapple animal to drink from, and the bartenders make enough of the actual mixed drink for two people. We brought soft coolers with us to hide in our tote bags to save money and stock up on drinks and blah blah blah, but in the end, the only time we used them was on our trip to Tulum. We just decided to enjoy our vacation and ordered them from the copious amount of waiters wandering around the pool. If you are planning a trip and are trying to keep to a very stringent budget, this place may be a little harder to enjoy. My family went in trying to not think about the costs and just enjoy the vacation, which we were able to do since we were there as a timeshare, and we had an incredible time. It is easy to forget about the money since this is a cashless resort, and you put a $600 dollar hold on your credit card, and they notify you if you exceed that. I think we capped out between $1400-$1600 total for the week, so about $350-$400 a person for food and libations. One last set of quick tips: since you can't use cell phones, we found it helpful to ask to use phones at the bars, towel stands etc. to call back to room as often each family member had a different vacation agenda. Don't hesitate to ask to do this! The staff I dealt with was very happy to oblige, and it made it much easier if something was forgotten in the room. I also had asked some questions at Brio about using the spa if I booked a massage and was surprised to find out how little time I would be allowed to use it if I were to book a massage. You are only allowed to use the spa jacuzzis etc. for about 90 min. prior to your treatment; I thought they were going to tell me I could hang out all day! I also asked about the lazy river that the GM and MP are building and I basically got the run around. I saw some pictures from reading the Mayan Palace reviews. The pictures were taken in February. I checked them out on May 3rd, and it looked exactly the same, and there was no work being done from what I could tell. The front desk staff told me that their manager had said the lazy river \"might be finished next year\". My dad was really disappointed by this, as he loves a lazy river. I hope they do complete it, but I am not holding my breath. If you are still reading this post, thanks for sticking it through to the end! My vacation at the GM was incredible and the staff worked very hard to make sure that we enjoyed ourselves to the fullest. We did not encounter one unkind person there. Since I was there with my parents, this was not a hard partying vacation, and the GM is not a good place to go if that is the kind of vacation you are looking for. If you are looking for some serious sun bathing and endless pools to explore, this is the perfect place to go. This was my family's first vacation to Mexico, and we are eager to return.

I'll start with the cons and then move on to the pros. Cons: 1)Horrendous prices in the mini food mart and at the restaurants. You're paying American prices or worse in Mexico. 2)The beach is just plain *not nice*. The water is rocky and you'll find that no one swims in it, probably because it wouldn't be pleasant. 3)It's out in the middle of nowhere. You are completely isolated and don't even have the option of going to a more quaint local restaurant for food unless you want to deal with a 30+ minute ride to get to Playa del Carmen. 4)The timeshare sharks are evil. I loved how during our timeshare presentation when my husband and I said we weren't interested, the guy who was trying to make the package more enticing to us told us: \"What if I make sure you win the raffle for the cruise?\". Great, so not even the large prize raffle that everyone who suffers through a timeshare presentation is supposedly entered into is even legitimate. Also, I have attended other timeshare presentations before, and never have I been treated so rudely and been made to listen to the spiel of 5+ people. Take your money elsewhere! There are much nicer timeshare resorts in Playa del Carmen!!! 5) Check-in is at 5 pm.. That speaks for itself. 6)Since when should it cost $8 to do a load of laundry myself?? If we had been in town, I could have taken our dirty clothes to a local cleaner and been charged $0.90 per kilo to have someone wash, dry, and fold the clothes for me. I don't even want to think about what this hotel would have charged for a full service like that. 6) No ocean views... All rooms are all very removed from the ocean and beach and don't offer views. It's no wonder though, since the beach is ugly... Pros: 1) The Grand Mayan has beautiful pools. We were there during the height of the swine flu scare and so it was easy to find available lounge chairs and beds by the pool as the hotel was empty. I am told it is packed solid normally though, and don't know if it is normally relaxing with all the crowds. 2) Friendly employees. 3)Cool golf carts to drive you from one end of the hotel to another. 4)Nice jacuzzi 5)Beautiful surroundings and gardening (though nothing nice is beach front). Word for the wise: If you are planning on listening to their timeshare presentation, make sure you schedule it towards the end of your stay. By that time, you will have decided you don't like the hotel and won't fall victim to the initial beauty of the hotel and buy something you'll regret.", "Date": "May 15, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cI've stayed in better\u201d", "Author": "frequentflyer1549", "ReviewID": "UR29795696", "Content": "My husband and I stayed from 4/25-5/9/09.

They don't offer the same incentive to everyone. If you plan on attending, you should defintely advocate for a higher incentive or attend at a different resort: We listened to another at Moon Palace ( all-inclusive) and received a free day pass (8:00AM-11:00PM). This included free meals and drinks (liquor included) thru-out the day and 1,000 USD play money which could be applied to their spa (back massage, facial, suana, steam room, pedicure and manicure) the cost of your car rental and a trip to the Wet & Wild where you get to swim with the dolphins. Worst: You pay for everything: gym, internet (their computers are very slow) so you need at least 2 hours at $7/hr. The washer & dryer are small and cost $4.00 each. The food is ok and definitely not worth the price. A can of soda can cost you $3.50-$4.00 depending on which restaraunt you go to. The alcoholic drinks are weak.

As always the restaurants were good at Riviera Maya, although on the expensive side. We were not that pleased with the very expensive lobster dinner at Tramontos. We also ate at the Gong restaurant and if you are looking for sushi, a good place to go. The food at Havana Moon is very good and it has a great view of the ocean. Overall staff everywhere was courteous, but didn't go out of the way to be helpful. Although it was said in another post there was open WIFI in the room , I was unable to get WIFI in building 10 or anywhere else for that matter. I tried everything possible and could find no open access points. It was necessary to go to the Internet Cafe area to access the Internet at $7/hr. It was nice that I brought the laptop as many were using the computers in the evening. They had to actually physically look at your connection and then enter the IP address in their system for you to get online. All of that said, we loved being in Jungle Rooms. We were in building 10, third floor and never waited more than 2 minutes for shuttle. We were in an odd numbered room on the jungle side (even number rooms are on the golf course side). We enjoyed looking at wildlife from our porch. One morning a family of coatamundi were climbing through the trees. This area is due to be developed and that's a shame. Our soaking pool was refreshing (even though tile was falling off one side. Maintenance responded very quickly). The resort is beautiful. We had a rental car (holidayautos.com) and found that convenient and easy. This was actually through Alamo. No problems in or out. We are members of the Grand Mayan. Upon check-in we were asked about the presentation and we declined. We were not bothered from that point on by sales pitches, even though our two friends weren't members. We really enjoyed CrcoCun and recommend it for families. It's inexpensive, clean and guide was very knowledgeable. We held several animals. Also walked all around the Botanical Gardens just south of Puerto Moreles . Certainly need more places preserved and protected. We went to Coba and then Tulum. It was worth the trip to Coba, but by the afternoon it was too hot. So Tulum even though gorgeous was just too much for the one day. Wish we'd had more time there. We loved the beach at Puerto Moreles and spent a great day there relaxing in front of restaurant under a rented umbrella. This was the first place when you walked down to the beach. I think it was $10 for the day for the umbrella. Drinks and food were very good. Our absolutely favorite restaurant was Alux in Playa del Carmen.

We followed their advise and got lovely accommodations in building four. It should be noted that the walls are thin. You can hear a great deal of what is going on in adjoining rooms. Also, and I believe this has as much to do with the climate as anything else, there is a mustiness to the rooms. Neither of these things were a major distraction for us, however. All of the restaurants on the facility are good, and reasonably priced. Unless you have a great desire to be near or on the beach, I would recommend using the pool exclusively for Grand Mayan guests versus the one shared by Mayan Palace guests. Either way, however, spaces are \"reserved\" by beach towels early in the morning, so you would be well advised to get up and pick a spot, then go back to bed or to breakfast. We utilized the travel agent within the Grand Mayan to arrange a couple of excursions and were pleased with the service. I would recommend the zip line adventure through AllTOURnative, and the trip to Tulum. If I had it to do over again, however, I would simply do the Tulum express tour and skip the Xelha water park. The snorkling was less than impressive as is the inner tube ride down the river through the mangroves. All in all it was a wonderful experience. I would recommend the Grand Mayan to anyone from honeymooners to families to retirees", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "pville", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful resort but guard your valuables.\u201d", "Author": "toothfairy_8", "ReviewID": "UR28247156", "Content": "This resort is very beautiful and well maintained. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The taxi rate is ridiculous when you have 6 people, so I recommend going to the highway and catching public transportation. Beware: you have to cross the highway to catch a ride to Playa so be careful. The cars are going at a high rate of speed. If you take the collectivo (public transportation) you will be dropped off at the bus depot. You walk about 4 blocks and you will be at 5th avenue. If you take the taxi, they will drop you off and pick you up at Walmart. 5th Avenue is only about 4 blocks away from WalMart. The last pick up is at 9:00PM. The pulbic transportation runs until 11:30. The girls went swimming one evening and took a bag with them. We happened to walk by and they were talking to one of the staff members. Now that we look back ,we wonder if the girls were being distracted while someone else went through the bag looking for valuables. When they got back to the condo, they were missing a camera and an ipod. We called the resort and they said since it happened at the pool there was nothing they could do. So, do not take things of value to the pool and leave them unattended and always lock up any money and vauables in the safe. We took a day trip to Tulum (ruins), centoes (fresh water underground caves) (snorkling)Akuamla Bay (snorkling with the tutlres), the Lagoon (snorkling) and it was a great trip. Wecalled edventruestour.com and they were wonderful. Our guide for the day was Emanuel (Manny for short) and he was great. They came and picked us up at the front gate and brought us back to the resort. Also, while we were there, one person in our party got sick and needed an antibiotic and the driver took us to Sam's Club to get some medication. I would highly recommend this tour group to anyone interested. The resturants are great and we thought the prices were fair. We ate breakfast and lunch in the condo and then would eat out in the evening. The food we ordered was tasty and reasonably priced. The service was a little slow at night but we had nothing to rush to, so we were fine with sitting a liitle longer. The beach is tricky but once you get past the rocks, there is some good snorkeling. We took the snorkeling trip of out the dive shop at the resort and it was a nice trip ($47 US for adults although we heard one party of 10 negotiated a price of $40 each). Just keep track of your kids. One of ours swam off with another boat and we thought she was lost at sea. Not a good feeling for a mother! All in all, I would say our trip was wonderful except for the the lost articles. The weather was wonderful and the resort is very well maintained. It seemed as though there were lots of things to do for young children, but at times, our teens were a little bored. (That may have been more their fault.) The distance from town is a little far - giving the taxi drivers an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. However, if you utilize the public transportation, the cost is much more reasonable. Last but not least, protect your valuables.", "Date": "April 18, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "socal", "Title": "\u201cBIG and beautiful top shelf resort\u201d", "Author": "saramic", "ReviewID": "UR28039621", "Content": "\"BIG\" does not accurately describe the resort- more like \"HUGE\"! Our room was in the section called \"The Jungle\" and a 15 minute walk to the Lobby, however the front gate was half the distance from our room. I cite this because \"collectivo\" taxis ($2) to Playa del Carmen are waiting outside the gates and are an excellent alternative to the taxis which you can catch in thr resort ($20). The rooms are very nicely appointed and comfortable, however the halls are marble and tend to echo late night returns from the adult beverage curcuit. Most of the activities are next door at The Mayan Palace where we own and well probably stay next year. They have a store and several quite capable offerings for bars and restaurants. The Balche Bar, poolside, offersinexpensive and quite savory food. It was our choice several days for lunch and cocktails as there was alot going on around and in the pool, including a swim up bar. We had 2 late lunch/early dinners at the Havana Moon whichwasprepared very well and not too hard on the wallet -considering you are IN the resort. The Caribbean Show at The Mayan is a \"must see\". It is set on a double decker stage with an astounding array of costume color and spirited music.You are offered the choice of the caribbean styled cuisine prior to the show, if you choose, or simply arrive 15-20 before 8 pm to enjoy the show at no charge.

The rooms were spacious and clean. The beds were comfortable; nice firm mattresses. Bedding was fine. The grounds were manicured beautifully. Every meal we had (we had a group of 8) was quite good. We did not go to the upscale restaurants or the wine bar. The buffet restaurant was very good. Pools are beautiful, peaceful and well maintained. Transportation: Shuttle to Playa del Carmen was $4 per person. We picked up some staples at Walmart, where the shuttle drops you off to get us through the week. They have everything from food, clothing, wine and hard liquor. Call the desk to get the shuttle schedule. On the grounds of the resort the resort shuttle ran somewhat regularly, about every 15 minutes or so. It really isn't far to walk to any on the restaurants, lobby, pools or the beach. 10-15 minutes tops. At night it is a bit easy to get turned around while walking on the paths, especially when you first get there. Check out a map of the grounds to get your bearings. The pools are just plain gorgeous. We really enjoyed taking a day to just lounge poolside. Very relaxing. The gym is large with a good variety of equipment. Towels are available at the pool areas. Don't lose your towel card! You can exchange wet for dry towels anytime. If you want a desirable spot by a certain pool you better get there early. Some people think they can \"save\" a spot and go somewhere else for an hour then come back to their claimed spot. Doesn't work that way. We had a little run in with a group that left a couple of pool towels on chairs and left for about 45 minutes (at least). Of course we sat down, and some time later these people came over and said the chairs were theirs because they had sat in them earlier but had left to play volleyball at the beach. Golf was enjoyable. Because we went to the sales presentation we received a discount on our outing. $60 per person, 18 holes, cart, clubs (nice ones), a box of balls, tees and a bottle of water. The course is \"El Manglar\", a Jack Nicklaus designed par 3. This is the nicest par 3 I have played, with a good mix of greens tucked in between bunkers or water hazards eating any errant shots. We did the one day Xel-Ha/Tulum excursion. $100 per person, including transportation, drinks and meals. This is truly all inclusive. Fantastic. One day is not enough time for Xel-Ha. The bus left the Grand Mayan at 9 am and it was about 10:40 by the time we were walking in the gate at Xel-Ha. This is where the food and drinks are. Very good breakfast buffet with choices of traditional or American cuisine. Same for the lunch menu also with choices of different restaurants. Extremely helpful and courteous staff. Towels available everywhere. Lockers and showers with changing rooms too. All part of the package.Too many swimming and rafting things to do in one day. Our group did the river tube float, the cliff of courage, breakfast, a quick lunch and a quick swim in a small cenote. Much more is available. We had to leave there at 2:30 in order to get to Tulum. Tulum was interesting and they also have a beautiful beach there too. Nightlife in the resort shuts down by midnight. No problems with noisy drunks after about 11pm. If you really want the bar scene you need to go to Playa del Carmen. All in all, we would definitely go back to this place. Not so good stuff: Nightlife in the resort shuts down by midnight. They offer a nightly show at the buffet restaurant, but you must pay for a meal. Can't just have drinks and watch the show. They also had a band at the Havana Moon restaurant on a couple of nights. You can dance to the music there, but not many did. Gym use cost $10 per guest per day, if you care to use it. If you want to shower their after your workout that cost extra. Happy hour drinks are weak. This was my groups experience at the pool bar. They do run drink specials, such as Mai-Tais, and those were potent. I ordered a vodka martini at the Havana Moon restaurant and it tasted like the vodka was allowed to sit in ice for several minutes in order to melt enough to fill a small martini glass. We went to the sales presentation. You will have to prepare yourself for this! First, we had the buffet breakfast with Maggie. She was very nice and professional. She also showed us the current room design for the resort. After that she took us to the International Sales building. We were handed off to Eugenia at this point. She pointed out that coincidentally we happened to be there at \"marketing week\"! What a break for us! Eugenia was not very pleasant at all. A know-it-all, rude, and pushy. According to her the the global economic problems that are happening right now are all in my head. She gave up and passed us on to Jose S. but not before telling us we would not be allowed to come back for 5 years because we were not buying. He sat with us for about two minutes and got up when I told him that I did not want to sell them our Hilton property. \"Why are you here then\" he said! I told him I was willing to listen to any reasonable sales pitch. He left mumbling something about a waste of time. He passed us onto someone who escorted us to a third person who passed us onto Ted, who listened to our complaints, had us fill out a survey. Ted passed us onto Richie who made all kinds of offers which we declined. Of course, we were then passed onto someone else who tried to get us to sign up for something-don't even remember at this point. We left after signing that we would get our gift of 10% plus a 1,000 peso discount off the bill.

The rooms were very clean and the service was friendly and good. The pool was a bit far away and there is no ocean view rooms, but there were plenty of shuttles going to and from the pool and other ammenities. Our disappointment came with the quality of the food. It was more the quality that you would expect at an all-inclusive - very mediocre. We had a couple of very good meals in Playa del Carmen. We also had our very best meal at a restaurant very close to the resort. It was the Piano Cafe at the entrance to Maroma Bay. We were a little suspicous when we first walked in as we were the only ones there, but it had been recommended by the concierge so we stayed. Apparently, most don't show up until 8 or so and we were there at about 7:15. It really was an incredible dinner! Their address is Km 51 Cancun-Talum Hwy. Phone number is [--].

Yes, but..... The Positive: The cleanest, best cared for resort I have been to (in any category: family, luxury, AI, I have stay in all of them). The rooms are stellar in design and size - we had a Grand Master Suite which is a combination of the other two categories. The kitchen was very well equipped with a 3/4 size fridge, microwave, oven, blender, toaster and cooking and eating utensils. These people clearly know how to party as there about a dozen wine glasses and about twenty regular glasses along a generous number of utensils. There were a couple of pots and pans etc (cooking is not something I do on holiday unless I am at a cooking school so I can't recall exactly what was there). The grounds are immaculate and cleaned almost compulsively by the large staff. They cleaned everything often. I have to think this is connected with the ongoing efforts to sell timeshares. As a \"hotel\" guest we got the bonus of that effort without being sucked into the vortex of presentations or, god forbid, a purchase. We felt sorry for every kid we saw being dragged around while mom and dad heard the hard sell - really, if the 10% savings is important, leave a day early, save the nightly cost and avoid wasting a full day. If you love your kids, do it. If you could see those poor kids looking longingly at my kids playing in the pool as they walked with their parents...you would understand. On that point: the friendly, attractive person who approaches just before or after you check in is not the \"host\" there to assist you throughout your vacation they purport to be...they do hand out a rather useful tour book, but other than taking that item - run away! Being rude has its place and wasting my vacation time is one such event which ensures I will tell you to (with Pythonesque aplume) , (-) off! The staff were universally great. Treat them with respect and good humour(and by this I do not mean tips necessarily although we did tip on ocassion) and you will get good natured, efficient service. On occassion we had trouble locating a pool side server or our drinks did not materialize, but that was the exception. This place is not understaffed by any measure. The 15% tip is included on every transaction. You can top it up. We paid our room attendants often...they will drop off two envelopes on the last day for their tips, but we gave them cash along the way. The food was above average to very good (never into the excellent category, but almost always above expectation for this type of resort). The exception was Gong...which was a real gong show. I hate to generalize and rarely do, but I never had good sushi in any place without at least one well trained (read, ten years in Japan starting as a dishwasher and working up) sushi chef. The sushi and maki fell apart and really lacked that freshness which defines good Japanese. The waiter cook not even pronounce most the dishes and we ended up getting the wrong things (despite crear \"pointing\" to the menu items). The poor man had no clue what he was serving. One meal never did come despite repeated assurances that it was coming. The Kobe style sashimi (which of course is really just carpaccio served in Japanese themed restaurant!) was very good. Del Lago was a surprisingly great place to eat. Great breakfasts and a variety of well prepared food for supper (we never did eat lunch there). The pizzas from Balche were really good thin crust pizzas. The mediteranean style was particularily good. Havana Moon was a favorite with the kids (they are not chicken nugget sorts of eaters and know and demand good food). Never made it to Tramontos as it was always full. We took in parts of two shows. They are resort quality...hard to watch aerials done locally when you have already seen 6 or 7 Cirque de Soliel shows. Don't come here for the shows! The nightly band was great (we could hear them clearly from our room and loved the mix of music). The beach of course is nice to wander and peer into the tide pools. We saw plenty of snails, baby puffer fish, hermit crabs and other fish. Way more fun than swiming and the pools more than make up for the lack of beach swiming. They are fantastic, varied and well cared for. The $25 for 25 minutes reflexology by the pool with a beer in hand and one on ice in the bucket...heaven. Despite what others have posted, there is excellent wireless at the resort. Used it almost daily. Shockingly: it is free! Tip: The best buildings for location are (and they come in paurs with a common elevator and lobby) are 1&2 (right beside the croc enclosure which are kids quick liked)and 7&8. I would not stay in the area called the \"Jungle\" as it is simply too far away from everything. That includes buildings 9-13. Buildings 3&4 are not too bad. The Less Positive: OMG are those beds friggin hard! I hate inefficiency (I know...I am in in the wrong country), but geez: after they print your name out on the chit with your room number, you have to then write it out again (your full name and room number) directly above the identical printed out inforamtion. Nothing to worry about, but indicative of the place...they love paper. The place is not cheap, but you know that already. The place is just a wee bit too far from town for my liking 20 minutes plus. One driver did make it in 14 minutes flat - heck of a ride. Having said that though, it is still cheaper to take the round trip to Playa or to Puerto Morales than to by food in the resort. The Stuff that Ticked me off: 60 pesos....the concierge charged me that to make a local call to a local attraction. For that 60 pesos alone I would not return. On principle (and I don't pack them away just because I am on vacation), any resort charging me 60 pesos for their concierge to make a local call will not see me gracing their location again. I think that 60 pesos is a real money loser for them. Penny smart and dollar stupid in my view. The real kicker for me was the care I did not get because of own unpreparedness and a bit of bad luck. I travel with a number of credit cards and my debit card. I use the debit card to get cash from ATM's. My wife has the duplicate cards. When the server in the US connecting my bank to the world died for more than 24 hours, I could not get cash. I was now completely disconnected from my cash. My credit careds are fine, but I can't use them in the ATM. Naturally I figure that the hotel (which has about $10K of my money already) will cash advance me on my credit cards. Sure they say ...here is $50 US (minus 10% commission)...as that is their limit. Now I know I should (and will) PIN my credit cards which I never use for cash advances, but geez, $50? Might just as well say \"no\" to me. I managed to find a front desk attendent, who, upon hearing my story of woe, took pity and advanced me $200. She was worried she would get in trouble and I tipped her well. THAT is not how guest should be cared for. In Conclusion: Fantastic resort, excellent rooms, good food, wooden mattresses, great pools, great service, some stupid management policies, too far from Playa, no real nightlife to speak of. If that fits your needs, you will love it. If not...look elsewhere.

Read the reviews and you decide for yourself - we did, we knew what to expect and expectations were exceeded. Arrival \u2013 know how you are getting to your hotel. When you walk out of baggage in Cancun, you will walk through an area that looks very official. Lots of well dressed folks in Khaki trying to take you to a desk on either side. They promise they know what hotel you are going to, how to arrange you a ride \u2013 etc. They are time share salesmen. When you go outside, there will be another group. If you have lined up transportation, or your hotel provides it \u2013 walk out the front doors, across the street and to the covered island. This is where the shuttle drivers are located. It\u2019s about a $60 cab ride to the Play Del Carmen area, if you take a taxi. That was for a van and five passengers. Before you go, get about $50 in one-dollar bills, you can use these for tipping, starting at the airport. We stayed at what is referred to as the \u201cMayan Palace\u201d \u2026 technically there are two hotels here, the Mayan Palace and the Grand Mayan. These are both located in a geographic area called the Riviera Maya. Everyone is right \u2013 the Grand Mayan is huge \u2013 add the Palace and it\u2019s even bigger. We emailed, asked for \u2013 and received building 12/13 \u2013 the furthest one. If you like to get up walk on the beach \u2013 this is a bummer. My husband was not happy about this - as he likes to get up early and walk the beach. Otherwise, it\u2019s not that big of deal. None of the rooms have an ocean view, at least it didn\u2019t look like any did. The shuttle system worked terrifically. Shuttles come regularly, and they now have clocks and move it each time they leave letting you know about the time they will be back. I had just gotten my cast off my broken foot \u2013 so walking was not an option \u2013 and we used the shuttles with no problems. Yes \u2013 there is a pick up by the towel place near the pool \u2013 but note, this is for the Mayan Palace only \u2013 you have to talk to the front lobby to get the Grand Mayan shuttle. The only problem really is that there are no benches, anywhere. You might find a big rock. The front lobby has none \u2013 and you often find yourself waiting at the front lobby if you are in the GM. Note \u2013 if you are standing there \u2013 people will crowd in front of you \u2013 and you can be elbowed out of the next shuttle \u2013 so watch out for this. It is not expected that you tip the drivers. Towels \u2013 you get a towel card at check in. There is a towel hut you can exchange towels there. Make sure to get your card back. If you lose your card, it\u2019s a $30 charge. They close at 9 PM. The hut is near the activities desk at the main pool. Chairs at the pool \u2013 there is NO problem getting chairs at the pool \u2013 at any time. Especially if you are in the GM, the two top pools are for Mayan guests only and you have to wear these annoying arm bands to show that you can be at those pools. We found chairs at all times of the day. There IS a demand for chairs around the main pool at the bottom near the ocean. This is the happening pool if you have young people . Volleyball here. Access to beach. Activities center nearby. Two swim up bars. So \u2013 you do have to go down early and \u201creserve\u201d your chairs if you want to be by the main pool. There are countless pools of different depths, fountains, options for parents with little ones, terrific, beautiful pools. The palpas \u2013 good luck. I\u2019m still not really sure what the system is. The book says they are reserved at 7:15 at the restaurant near the main pool \u2013 near Balanche. The line starts forming at 6:45 \u2013 but the little shopping center that you have to go through to get to the main pool from the main lobby doesn\u2019t open up until 7 AM. So you have to sneak your way in from around the sides. You can register two days at a time. My husband was third in line. Arrived at 6:45 AM \u2026 and all the palpas were booked for that day and the next day- you could book for Friday. Makes no sense. One woman stayed an hour and waited \u2013 and snagged one for the next day that someone came down to cancel. I\u2019d ask at the front desk, concierge, etc \u2013 if you want one \u2013 to figure out how to get one. They charge $30 a day, but you get it back if you eat/drink that much at the pool. Very nice if you are going to spend the entire day at the pool \u2013 as you can take a nice nap in the shade on the big mattress in the Palpa. We went down early \u2013 got some chairs by the pool under some palm trees and had sun and shade depending on where we sat all day. Worked fine \u2013 but no big soft mattress. It seems that the palpas on the beach and up at the GM pools are first-come, first \u2013served. Snorkeling \u2013 we went on the $47 snorkel trip offered at the activities center right on the beach in front of the hotel. Great group- some nice snorkeling. Lots of fish. We brought our own snorkels and masks, and used their fins. Ended with a stop at a beach and a game of soccer. Drinks provided. Charge right to your room. 13 and under \u00bd price. Parasailing \u2013 the boys also went parasailing. Booked at the same activity center, $60. Go that day and just schedule a time. They loved it. The beach. It\u2019s rocky. Very rocky. We knew this, expected it and just dealt with it. We all brought water shoes \u2013 Tevis \u2026 and our snorkels. The boys did some great snorkeling on their own right there at the swim area. If you have shoes you can go out \u2013 no problem. Waiters \u2013 very good about stopping by frequently, you can run a tab. 15% tip is automatically included on all charges. They even have waiters at the beach. Lots of chairs at beach. Happy hour runs from 11 AM \u2013 1 PM. Say you want \u201cone for two\u201d and you must get the exact same drink. If you drink beer, order \u201ctwo for four\u201d before 1 PM and ask for a bucket and you are set for the afternoon. Food. We ate just about everywhere. Book Taramonto soon as you arrive, or call or email a week out and book. Book with the Concierge \u2013 they don\u2019t always answer the phone at the restaurant. Food is excellent. Reasonably priced. We had the Chateau Briand (sp?) \u2026 and make it for two - $52. We ate at Blanche \u2013 by the main pool. We had all kinds of appetizers ..and at pizza by the pool. All was very good. Pizzas are quite good and the guacamole is terrific. We ate dinner at Havana Moon one night and loved it. Very good food and service. We all had something different and it was all good. There is a band at 8 PM. The boys had sandwiches at the snack shop in the little mall \u2013 you can ask them to be pressed into a Panini right there. There are shows at Del Lago about every night, I think all the shows are free, except Thursday \u2013 which is the Mexican show. I know folks ate breakfast at this buffet and loved it. We ate the one dinner on Thursday \u2013 which you must book in advance. Do it when you arrive, or email the concierge ahead of time \u2013 we did \u2013 confirmed when we got there \u2013 no problem. This was really fun. The food was terrific. Drinks included. Free hat for the guys. Show was very good. Enjoyable. Little long \u2013 but nice. Activities \u2013 we did a couple. Just check calendar and activities center. All were nice. Some of the men take beach volleyball WAY too seriously and crowd the kids out and get too physical. Come on guys \u2013 chill out, it\u2019s resort beach volleyball! One guy refused to let me 13-year-old rotate in \u2013 because \u201che already had his team.\u201d After my son waited his turn, another \u201csix man team\u201d showed up and wouldn\u2019t let him play \u2013 \u201cbecause they already had a full team.\u201d Come on. BTW \u2013 my son is tall and athletic. The one down side \u2013 not a lot for teens to do at night. My son did a pretty good job of trying to meet other teens \u2013 and organizing a gathering in front of Havana Moon at 9 PM. The teens would gather, talk and enjoy the beach. Without this \u2013 there would not have been much of a social life for teens after dark. Playa Del Carmen. You can catch a shuttle, it\u2019s $6 a person into Playa. Taxi\u2019s are 200 pesos or $20, confirm the price before you get in. You can change money at the hotel. Pay in pesos \u2013 otherwise it can overpay 30-40%. If there are four of you \u2013 just take a taxi. Five is a problem \u2013 as you have to take a van or two taxi\u2019s \u2013 and they charge you $400 pesos for the van. Bummer. We ate at Xe Chate \u2013 something like that sounds like \u201cash tray\u201d \u2026 Mayan cuisine. Highly recommend. Get a reservation. Reasonably priced, great food, great service, great price \u2013 and a chance to try Mayan dishes. Playa is great. We went down our first night. Ate dinner. We asked to go to La Parilla \u2013 and didn\u2019t end up at the Mexican food one \u2013 which is a bit more touristy. We ended up at something like La Parilla del Carmine. Great food. We then walked to Wal-Mart, Mega would be fine too. Wal Mart is a zoo. Get ready. You can use a credit card. We bought breakfast stuff, some beer, soda, and a couple big jugs of water. Buy some avacodos, pineapple, watermelon \u2026 all very good. Water is not a problem at the hotel \u2013 you can drink the tap water. We also bought a little lunch stuff \u2013 but since we were at the farthest unit \u2013 you would lose an hour or so just to go back to eat lunch in the room \u2013 so we didn\u2019t. We ate at the pool. They do not want you to bring food, or drinks to the pool. You can bring some snacks in your bag. We also would get a tall bottle of water (you\u2019ll know what I mean when you get there \u2013 the kind they sale) fill \u00bd with water put in freezer, and then fill up in AM and take to the pool in a bag. Best thing I did, packed some plastic silverware and paperplates, bowls and cups. Took the cups in my bag to the pool \u2013 and you can pour water. Don\u2019t also have to do so many dishes. We just rinsed out our plastic breakfast bowls (wrote names on the bottom) and used again the next day. You could also buy at Wal- Mart. There is no dishwasher. Also no kitchen towels. Just a role of paper towels. If you leave dishes \u2013 there is a $45 charge. Tours \u2013 sightseeing: we did not get a car. We didn\u2019t miss it. We were only there a week, if we were there two, we might have gotten a car. We just didn\u2019t want to deal with it \u2013 the police, or the expense. So \u2013 we used Yucatreks tour on two days. We went to Tulum and Beyond one day \u2013 I highly recommend this. We visited Tulum in the morning. Depending on where you are \u2013 you meet them in town or they pick you up. It was $107 each. They give you water, pay your admission and provide a local guide. (You can tip the guide.) Then they give you a snack and another drink and you drive to a beautiful private beach. Restroom, drinks and a great lunch next to the beach. You are here about two hours. Terrific. THEN you go to the Grand Cenote, part of it in a cave \u2013 just terrific \u2013 swim in a crystal clear cenote. Beatuiful \u2013 refreshing \u2013 terrific day. Bring your snorkels. They pay for admission. Then you go to another cenote \u2013 this one is all outside, and you can jump off an overlook in. You tip your driver and guide \u2013 ours was Mitch \u2013 great guy, great English and really very nice. We took a second tour \u2013 to Chitzen Itza. (It happened to be on the equinox \u2013 so they flipped the day so we could see the snake on the period \u2013 google if you want more.) Normally, you drive three hours to CI, then stop and eat lunch in a delightful town. Good food. Little time for shopping \u2013 I mean little. Best item \u2013 buy some handmade sandals at the sandal shop next to the food place you will stop at. Mitch can show you. $15 a pair \u2013 beautiful hand crafted sandals, we bought four pair. One of the lady\u2019s on our tour said she bought some last trip and loved them \u2013 she bought four more pair. Then you to do a cenote that is inside a cave \u2013 it\u2019s majestic \u2013 very cool. Not snorkeling water \u2013 but just beautiful \u2013 great pictures. I highly recommend this group. We talked to other folks who went on other tours \u2013 and I think this is by far the best deal. They are friendly \u2013 never more than 16 people \u2013 they line up the guides, provide food, drinks, etc. There are some outside vendors outside the cave \u2013 time to do a little shopping. One vendor has ice-cold coconuts he will cut and put in a straw in and you can drink. When you are done \u2013 take it back to him and he will use his machete and carve out the coconut and put it in a bag for you to eat. Maybe $2? You will also run across old women, and little girls trying to sell you embroidered handkerchiefs for $1 or 15 pesos. We bought a bunch. Have some dollars. Just seems like the right thing to do. The people need the money and it\u2019s a trade for them \u2013 they aren\u2019t asking for handouts but trying to sell a craft. Oh \u2013 and during the drive \u2013 Mitch showed some great cable shows on the ruins or the Mayan culture \u2013 great stuff. They tell you want to bring, etc. Everything is very safe \u2013 you can take it with you and leave it at the cenote or leave in the van with the driver. Bathrooms \u2013 the resort is fine. You leave the resort and get ready. Often you have to pay a couple pesos \u2013 if you pay \u2013 make sure and ask for TP!!! Ok \u2013 and \u2013 you can\u2019t flush the TP \u2013 you have to put it in a trash can. Their plumbing system isn\u2019t good enough to flush it all. Lovely. So \u2013 when you leave the grounds make sure you have some pesos \u2013 in case you have to go! Check out . Very easy. They have checkout at each building from 7-10AM \u2013 I think. Check the hours. We were not able to take our towels back to the hut and get our cards \u2013 and he let us turn in our towels. We set up our own cab \u2013 with the driver who took us to town \u2013 and he showed up right at the building. The provided us \u00bd the bill the day before we checked out \u2013 so I had gone over that. Went over the last two day s- and it was all right. No problems. Airport \u2013 we went over March spring break. It was very crowded. We got there early. If you are too early, the screen/ or airline name won\u2019t even be up at the monitors behind the check in counters. WE were looking for the United counter and couldn\u2019t find it. Finally went to monitor \u2013 saw it was 24, 25, 26 \u2013 and we just went and stood in line at those counters. All the Mexican people we dealt with were very nice. My son speaks some Spanish and would try to converse when possible \u2013 all tried to help him and were very gracious. We loved the resort. We loved learning about the Mayan culture and seeing the ruins, the cenotes were terrific. Prices were very reasonable. There were no signs of problems, or issues (as have been mentioned in the media). The resour is well maintained, and very clean. It was a great trip \u2013 and we are looking forward to going back again.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Novi, MI", "Title": "\u201cAnother great vacation at the Grand Mayan!\u201d", "Author": "koosh0122", "ReviewID": "UR26770473", "Content": "This was our 2nd time to this reort. We are not members. We traded in last year. We enjoyed it so much that we rented three two bedroom units for a week stay with friends. I really don't know where the bad press comes from. We had 12 adults. 10 of whom who had never been here before. They loved it. As long as you know ahead of time that the beach was unswimmable it's not that big of a deal. The pools more than make up for it. As for all the travel warnings about kidnappings in Mexico. Not once did we feel any concern for our safety especially at the resort. We went to Playa twice for dinner and felt it was extremely safe. We went to the Tulum beaches for the day and these were breath taking. We went to Puerto Morales for a day of snorkeling. This was great little town just 10 min north of the resort. Food at the resort was great. The buffet at Del Lago is ok. Just a little bit overpriced but the atmoshphere is great. Tramato and Gong had the best food at the resort. At night, the pool restaurant turned into Frita's, great desert! Overall, restaurants had great food. Price are typical of American restaurants. No Mexican bargains here. During the day on the resort, you have to rent out a Palapa. This is a shaded grass roofed building with a full size bed. It cost around $30 dollars for the day. However, if you spend $30 dollars or more at the bar or the pool side restaurant you get reimbursed that $30 dollars. It's a no brainer. By the way, happy hour 2 for 1 from 11am-1pm. We did have a car for this trip. If you have an American Express card, they have supplemental insurance available. With this, you need only to buy the liability insurance which is $11 a day. Our Visa and Mastercard did not cover international rental car insurance. If we did not have our American Express, insurance would have been another $45 a day. Driving in Mexico was easy. Just watch out for the speed bumps out of nowhere on the highway. We got an intermediate car for $158 for the week. This includes tax and liability insurance. I highly recommend renting a car. We went to the Tulum twice during this trip. It is about 45 min south of the resort. If you have a car, the trip is much more economical than if you were to book it through the resort. The resort price for the Tulum tour is $70 a person. We drove down with our group and paid for our own private guide. It cost around $12 a person. The ruin were great. We did the whole thing in about an 1 1/2 hours. We than drove down to the Tulum beaches which is about 4 miles from the ruins. These were some great days. We happened to stop at a small establishment called Playa Azul. It was a gorgeous beach. Something you would see in a Corona's commercial. The first day we probably saw 10 people all day. We rented boogie boards and rode the waves all day. We sat under shaded chairs as they catered to us with food and drink. What a day on the beach. If you really want to get away from it all, Playa Azul in Tulum is the place. We enjoyed this beach so much we came back here the last day of our trip. That night we went to a restaurant called Zamas. It is a small restaurant on one of the stretches of Tulum. Great food! Great atmoshphere over looking the ocean. Very authentic Mexican food. This restaurant has been written up in many international travel magazines. It is a hidden gem. Tulum is a very underdevelped beach enviroment which has not been commercialized or Americanized. Go to Tulum for a day. Not just the ruins. One of the best parts of our trip. One day we set a snorkeling trip in Puerto Morales with a dive shop called Aquanauts. It is a family owned businuess located in the Hotel Carmen Hacienda. The Grand Mayan would charge you $65 a person for this trip. Since we booked it on our own, it cost $25 per adult and $13 per kid. All equipment provided. Saw a ton of fish in a shallow reef about 10 minute boatride out. We ate lunch at the Hotel. This was our worst meal of the trip. You have to walk around Puerto Morales. It is a quaint fishing village. If you like to work out, Brio's has a great gym and spa. If you are staying at the Grand Mayan, acess to the area is free. If you are staying at the Mayan Palace, it will be $10 a day. My wife and I worked out 4 out of the 7 days. The hot tub here is so relaxing. I spent some time in the Steam Room every day. If you don't work out or use the Spa, you have to check it out. We had such a great time on this trip. The people at the Grand Mayan were so helpful and friendly. The accomodations are spectacular. The ground are gorgeous. The Pools are the most amazing pools I have ever seen. My wife and I are well travelled. Best pool areas we have ever been at. If you don't like to walk, do not come here. We enjoyed our walks. We enjoyed the mild exercise and each others company during these walks. We never took a shuttle. We would come here again in heartbeat! PS we did not do the timeshare presentation. our time is more valuable. most people we talked to said they could not get out in less than 3 1/2 hours.

The resort is one of the prettiest I have seen. The pool area is spectacular. The restaurants are good. After that it is all down hill. The resort is away from the beach and hides the beach from view from any rooms and most other parts of the resort. When you see the beach you will discover why. It is the worst beach ever. No real access and there is rocks the size of bowling balls everywhere. Even with water shoes, it is treacherous to walk out. Many of the rooms are too far to walk to the lobby and all of the restaurants and pool areas. They have trams running as shuttles, but you spend too much time waiting for the trams. God forbid if you forget something in your room. It can ruin your day, making an extra trip back and forth. The golf course is a par 54 course. I did not even bring my golf shoes for that. The tennis courts (which they charge for) have a carpet surface with sand spread over the carpet. Both my wife and daughter slipped and fell resulting in a shortened session and several bruises. The carpet is torn on one court at the center base line, so you had to be careful not to trip on it chasing a ball. They have a peculiar policy of running your credit card for $600 at check-in for room charges. When the $600 is gone they call and ask you to come by the front desk and pay some more. No other resort I have seen does this since they have your card on file and can charge whatever they need to when you check out. If you skip out they can still charge your card. We stayed in the Grand Mayan Acapulco last year and loved it. That is why we wanted to try this resort. I would definitely recommend against this resort, if you like a nice beach and do not like standing around waiting for shuttles to get anywhere. Also I would recommend KinMont fro airport transportation when coming to this area. they are very freindly and professional, speak good English and show up on time. just do not have them take you to this resort.", "Date": "March 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "2", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Osceola, WI", "Title": "\u201cNot the nicest Mayan Resort\u201d", "Author": "Retiredreviewers", "ReviewID": "UR26179070", "Content": "Many people mention that this resort is too large.

Up from the main beach there is an area of the beach that looks like it is somewhere in the Rust Belt. A fence limits access to this area and the beach isn't maintained but it is visible. Dirty with plenty of litter. I have never seen anything like this at the other two Mayan properties we have stayed at. This company must realize that it is in competition with resorts that have nice beaches and at least 50% of the people getting a chance at an ocean front view.

The maintenance crew worked around the clock it seemed to keep the grounds in superb condition. The vast array of native plant life gave the resort an extremely lush appearance. Our room was in Building 10 in an area known as \"The Jungle.\" It was a fair distance away from the common areas, but golf cart shuttles were frequently available to transport those who were unwilling to walk the 8-10 minutes to reach most destinations. Our room was a 2-bdr suite with a small 5' x 7' pool on the balcony. It was a great room of above-average quality and had a mini-kitchen and 32\" LCD TV's in the bedrooms. To address any concerns about the violence in Mexico, we never felt uneasy or unsafe at any time during our weeklong stay. We didn't actually leave the resort but talked to several couples who did make trips to Xcaret or into Playa del Carmen and they had absolutely no issues. The age groups varied widely. The majority of resort guests were over 50, but there were tons of families with small children as well as people in their 20's and 30's. It was a good mix.

The beach is inaccessible without aqua sox and great confidence. And there aren't enough bathrooms at the pools. There is one at each end and there are 3 stalls in each for women. There was always a line. Always. With all their emphasis on customer service, I found it ironic my very first request was turned down flat. I asked them to store a suitcase for me. I've left luggage at hotels all over the world and was stunned when they wouldn't do it. The rooms were a bit modern for my tastes. I'm not keen on olive, mustard and rust color schemes and disturbing art. We were in the Grand Mayan and found the buildings to be poorly designed. Every sound echoed down the halls. In the morning, they would splash a bucket of water down the halls to clean them and it sounded like a deluge and would wake you with a start. I found it curious that the sheets on the beds didn't cover the bottom of the mattress. My feet were always on bare mattress. And the overhead fans in the rooms were either off or full blast. You couldn't adjust the speed. We spent 5 weeks in Mexico and the only place I saw mosquitos was here at the Grand Mayan. Their man-made lagoon is really one big mosquito breeding pond and even though they spray every evening, you can't kill them all. We always made sure our patio doors were closed until after the guy with the spray went by. My biggest complaint was the no wifi in the rooms. They have 8 computers for the whole resort to use. And they, of course, charge you to use these very slow computers. And once you get a computer, someone else is pacing, waiting for you to get off. Figure out a way to charge me from the room! Maybe he was angling for a bigger tip, but one of the servers told us he worked for 48 pesos a day! This after a 2 hour commute, each way. The 15% tip that is added to virtually everything is split between servers and support staff after the house takes 50%. For the house to take something is pretty standard, but 50%?? Sheesh. After that we started carrying money for extra tipping, even though you are encouraged to not carry any money. The shuttles were inefficient. There are peak times of usage and they never seemed to be prepared. And we found it curious that the electric train was retired in the evening and they'd run these gas guzzling 15-passenger vans that weren't easy for everyone to get in and out of. I guess it's standard for time share kitchens, but I don't like trusting that the person before me properly cleaned the dishes. The first glass I pulled out had fingerprints and had obviously been used and not been cleaned. Also, there were no dish towels or dishrag or scraper. A paring knife or some kind of sharp knife would have been nice. There wasn't even salt!! And a 10 am checkout seems a little rude.

We stayed there in February of 2008 and 2009. We loved it even more the second time there (is that possible?). One thing you have to know: Mayan Palace is on the same property as Grand Mayan (basically the same resort but with different accommodations). Mayan Palace has use of the huge pool that is surrounded by cabanas, chairs & lounges. The restaurant Balche is right there along with the activity center which has activities for kids & adults (our daughter had a blast). Waiters walk around taking drink & food orders. To use a cabana, you have to sign up and pay for them, 350 pesos. The Grand Mayan has use of all three pools. The main pool, a smaller pool that is great for the kids since it has a sandy beach and is a walk in pool \u2013 great for all ages and really family friendly. There is also another huge pool for the Grand Mayan guests that has lots of nooks and coves surrounded by cabanas (which are first come gets it \u2013 however, note that saving a cabana does not fly. If you see a cabana and no people, check around. It may be yours for the taking as you are not allowed to save a cabana for later use. The staff will walk around will take your items to security/lost&found if left there unattended. I myself have no problem moving people\u2019s things if they are not around. Again, it is a first come, first gets it\u2026not first to put their lotions or shoes down and walk away until they decide to use it). First, some people have complained about their rooms being far away from everything. We stayed in building 12 which is the furthest. We enjoyed staying there as it forced us to walk. Not really a big walk! We looked forward to the walk every time since the resort is beautiful, ALL the people are friendly (staff & guests alike), and it is healthy! What could be wrong with that? The buildings there either overlook the forest/jungle or the golf course. We also stayed in building 2. The rooms in both buildings are BIG and laid out really nice. Building 2 is close to it all. We missed the walking from building 12, but didn't have any complaints staying in building 2 (who could complain about anything in this resort?). Some have complained about the cost of food in the resorts convenience store. It is a convenience; however, we have found that the food there was not much more than in Wal-Mart. We could also buy smaller size jars wasting less food than needing. We could walk to the convenience store, but have to drive to the market. The deli has good food as well. Fresh baked goods in the morning, sandwiches & salads for lunch, fresh fruit, ice cream\u2026plenty to choose from and enjoy. The coffee is good too! The Creperie is new and awesome! Careful, you could get addicted to those things, they\u2019re that good. The restaurants have good food. We\u2019ve eaten at Havanah Moon, Green Break, Tramonto, Balche and Lago. I am a food snob and quite picky (which drives my husband crazy). The food on the resort is good! Prices are reasonable for a resort as well. We have not tried the new Asian restaurant. The Grouper they make there is delicious (and I\u2019m not a big fish eater). You will not go wrong ordering it in any of the restaurants. The staff is professional, friendly and accommodating. Most of the staff speaks English. The staff around the pools is professionals at making sure everyone has fun. Again, the activity center provides fun for kids and adults. Our daughter made a pi\u00f1ata, made jewelry from beads, other bead crafts, a pirate hat & sword (along with face painting)\u2026as adults we took a bartending class (we had a great group for that one!), bingo, darts, card games, etc. Mind you, if you\u2019re just into lounging in a chaise by the pool, no one will bother you (except maybe you\u2019ll want drinks delivered to you as desired). Everyone will tell you to go to the town \u201cPlaya del Carmen\u201d. Lots of restaurants and stores. We ate in a few restaurants and were never disappointed. We also went Puerto Morelos. We went snorkeling there and had fun. We also ate at a beachfront restaurant. I don\u2019t recall the name, but it has a 2 level deck that had tables. The higher level has a roof while the lower does not. The food there was EXCELLENT! We also we to the zoo, CrocoCun. They will sell you a bag of fruit to feed the parrots, monkeys (that are free to roam), and deer. Great for the kids. Of course we went to Tulum and we ended up hiring a private guide to take us snorkeling for a half day.

I found most were favorable, but some were negative and did cause me some concern. I have to say that for anyone considering this hotel, disregard the negative...this hotel was beautiful! I have stayed at many 5 star resorts throughtout Maui, St Martin, Aruba, Vegas, Cabos, and Miami. This hotel met and exceeded our expecations. The hotel is clean, safe, well landscaped and the staff is top notch. The pool is out of this world and I can't imagine what anyone can find fault in. Yes, the beach is rocky, but the sand is clean and the pool is right there. The resort is large, but so what?! We traveled with my 2 year old and my inlwas (both in late 60's) and we loved walking through the grounds. We saw many animals and birds that were just beautiful. My only warning, is if you rent a car and leave the hotel. Highway 307 is the main road and the speed limit signs go from 100 to 40 within feet of each other. We got pulled over one night and the police said that if we give them $100 we can go. It was scary, as they carry machine guns and have oozies in the car. Just go slow and don't do anything silly. All in all - this hotel rocks and yes, the pizza from room service is GREAT!! There is always happy hour going on (2 for 1) and just enjoy it.

Big disappointment was terrible beach which was not swimable due to sharp coral and rocks at water line although kids had fun with shoes looking for creatures. Resort is very far from Cancun and Playa so expensive taxi rides ate up more money than we planned. Yes, you can take the shuttle to Playa and Walmart, but you pay just as much and it is difficult to get groceries back to the hotel. They make you wear these plastic hospital type bracelets all week to identify you for sales purposes. Restaurants were very expensive as were the excursions. Health and fitness area was an additional charge of $10/day. Please be very careful of your exchange rate and dealing with townspeople. We lost a lot of cash in translation. They all try to rip you off. One word of advice.....plan an extra hour and extra money to do anything outside of the gates. Figure in transportation time and costs and WATCH YOUR DOLLARS!!!

They wear you down by going through at least 4 different sales people. The pool area for the Grand Mayan was spa like and relaxing, however, if you want to be in the sun or pool side you need to get there early because the regulars have most of the seats saved by 8:00 am. This prevented us from enjoying the GM pool on several days. However, the Mayan Palace pool chairs were more comfortable and we enjoyed that also. Pool side service was great and the food was quite good. I was disappointed with the beach rocky conditions, as others on this site have stated, as I love to swim in the ocean. If you just want to sit on the beach and stick your feet in the water then you should have no problems. We tried all of the restaurants and enjoyed them all, with Havana Moon being our least favorite. Freida's, the Mexican (in the evening) pool side was quite enjoyable and the food was good as well.

It was our 5th stay at this location and the other couple's first time in Mexico. Simply paradise! We were truly taken by the beauty and privacy of the new Grand Mayan pool areas. Throughout the resort, there are so many pallapas with beds to choose from. We tried one for the first time and can't wait to get back next year -- so relaxing and comfortable! Particularly enjoyed seeing the flamingos and more crocodiles. The walk down the beach and to the north goes past the resort Valentin Imperial. A much easier walk now that the Valentin is there -- less rocks and more sand on the beach. However, their beach is unswimmable as well but one only needs to walk another 5-10 minutes north to beautiful sandy ocean bottom. We really loved the nightly bands for dinner/dancing at The Havana Moon and Del Lago. The wine bar is an excellent place to go before or after dinner. Tramonoto can never be beat - eat inside the restaurant, not in the overflow area--make reservations and try to get Manuel (handsome fun waiter with big dimples). Had a great massage and enjoyed the spa. Loved walking out to the pier and taking photos from there. The Havana Moon --eating outside at the ocean's edge at full-moon! Really impressed by all the kids' activities and Kids' Club. We were reluctant to attend the owners' presentation since we've already upgraded twice at Mayan Palace but the new perks were well worth our time. By making any kind of upgrade, you get the benefits of joining HSI since Mayan Palace has become affiliated with the Wyndham hotels and resorts. You also add Monday as an additional arrival day. You also do not pay maintenance fees for weeks you do not use. You will have better opportunities to give up any unwanted weeks to Wyndham and come out money ahead. We were hesitant about staying on the ground floor but that was no problem at all. We liked having the concierge people handy in some of the Grand Mayan building's lobbies - very helpful! The shuttle service ran like clock-work. Instead of walking long distances, we waited for the shuttle to bring us to our destination. Only left the resort to eat and shop in Playa twice and to swim with the dophins at Dolphin Discovery. Next year will def go to Rio Secreto after talking to those who loved this place. Oh my, you need to take a peek at the new condos and villas the Mayan Palace is building. Just think everything went great! Our friends became Mayan Palace owners and we did not influence their decision in any way. We just had the most restful, fun, delicious, beautiful and relaxed time! Next year we will try parasailing from the Mayan Palace. Great price $60 apiece. Can do doubles. You take off and land back on the boat. Go and live the good life!!

We went with 2 other couples and stayed in a 2 bedroom unit. Since it was one couples time share, they of course got 1 bedroom, and we took turns with the other bedroom. Fortunately for us the couches in the living room were comfy. The balcony spreads from 1 bedroom, in front of the living room, to the other bedroom, with sliders in each room. We spent a lot of time out there. I had read many reviews before, so I did know that the resort was big and lots of walking. I can't emphasis that enough. We stayed in building 9, \"the jungle\". It took quite a while to walk to the beach and pools...wear comfy shoes, good walking shoes. I wore flip-flops which are great for around the pool, not so great walking 10-15 minutes to get to the pool. When we arrived, the room wasn't ready, so they gave us a coupon for 25% off of lunch at Havana Moon. I highly recommend the Asain wrap there, yummy wrap with rice and veggies. After we got settled in our room, we took a taxi to Walmart for groceries, $60.00 US for the 6 of us. It is a cashless system which works out very well. Even with 6 of us sharing a room, were all had separate accounts. Some advise, go to the bank before you go and get $100 worth of pesos for tipping, we gave the bar staff an extra tip every day, and got great service! Rent one of the palapas by the pool, it's 340 pesos, around $24.00, but if you order that much in food and drink for the day, they deduct it, so basically the palapa is free. The pools are amazing!!! So many of them, which is great because as everyone has said, the beach is not swimable. Beautiful grounds, the beach looks beautiful, but unfortanetly, because of Hurrican Wilma in 2005, it's very rocky. The only excursion we did was to Xel-Ha, a good day. We took the shuttle into downtown Playa for the day one day, that was nice .We also went parasailing $60.00 for a 12 minute ride, booked right from the beach. We had a 5:30 flight to return home, so I was concerned as to what we were going to do for the day, as checkout is 10:00 am. No worries, we talked to the consierge, we checked out, but got to use the resort for the day, they gave us a hospitality room for 1/2 hour to shower and change to go to the airport...sure beats hanging out at the airport all day.

Judging from the prior review, I would say I probably lucked out with the weather. Although it was chilly when I arrived, the rest of the week was beautiful. It got progressively warmer as the week progressed and I only had one hour of rain from 6-7 one night while I was at the gym. Overall this resort is not bad, but it does have some drawbacks. Resort: The resort itself is beautiful. The lobby of the Grand Mayan reminded me a lot of the lobby at the Four Seasons Costa Rica. Simply beautiful. The Grand Mayan pool is also very well landscaped. One of the nicest pool areas that I have ever seen. However, the GM pool is not heated, so in the middle of February it was basically not swimmable. As the week progressed and the weather got warmer, I noticed that more people were goin in, but it was too cold for me. I had to go over to the Mayan Palace to go swimming, which is sort of unfortunate since the GM pool is much nicer. Rooms: I stayed in a two bedroom, which is really a studio connected to a one bedroom. So any noise issues from the neighbors I did not have. The \"however\" here is that there were some very very noisy people staying on our hall. Adults on spring break. They had no problem running down the travertine halls and screaming at 5am. Everyone on the hall was complaining, but the resort could do nothing about this. This I think is somewhat unfortunate. Many of the people on my hall were complaining they would not return to this resort because of this, but this could theoretically happen anywhere. Beach: As others have noted this is the weakness of the resort and why I probably would not return. The beach is no swimmable and extremely rocky. It also was very windy when I was there. There is nothing really wrong with it though. It has pretty water and lots of shade and seating. I guess I am spoiled. I have seen some of the nicest beaches in the world and this one just did not measure up, especially since I have stayed in Playa and been to the beaches in Tulum (which I think are some of the nicest in the world). It is hard to be so close to these other great beaches and yet feel so far. Service: Service is definitely one of the Grupo Mayan's strengths. I have stayed at the MP in Puerta Vallarta and Nueva Vallarta and their service is consistently very good for a timeshare. Everyone has a good attitude and is more than willing to help. As others have complained, the shuttle service is a bit too infrequent and most of the time I ended up walking to and from places. The maid service was a little spotty too, but generally I found everyone to be extremely pleasant and helpful. This is in sharp contrast to the service that I have recently received at some resorts in the Caribbean and why I generally choose Mexico over the Caribbean - well that and the food. Food: Food was great for a resort of this size. The Green Break breakfast buffet was my favorite. I ate there everyday except the one day I went to Dal Lago. I would say that Havana Moon was my least favorite. The Asian restaurant was terrific and I loved Balche for lunch. Pool sideservice also seemed pretty good. I actually thought the prices were quite reasonable for a resort, but again I am jaded. I live in NYC and my last vacation was to the Four Seasons Nevis where the breakfast buffet was $33USD and downright awful. $13 USD for a great buffet at the Green Break seemed cheap to me. Unlike the FS Nevis where food was barely edible (you can read my review of that one), here the food was almost universally delicious. Drinks also were very reasonable and at any given time it is likely happy hour someplace so you can get two for one. To give you an idea and entire family of four ate and drank every meal for a week, except for one dinner and two lunches, for $900 USD (including the amount subtracted for going to the presentation). Distance of Condo to Pool Etc.: Everyone is correct that the distances at this resort are large, but again I live in NYC and I walk everywhere anyway so to me this was not a big deal. Gym/Spa: I joined the gym for the week, which might have been a rip off since I did not go everyday. I recommend paying the 100 pesos per day instead. The gym is truly one of the nicest resort gyms I have ever seen. It was never crowded (since they charge you to use it) and it has a really nice location on the beach. I especially enjoyed the yoga room overlooking the water. This was really a highlight of the trip. The spa is pretty average. Not the nicest I have ever seen, but not the worst either. I had an 80 minute massage for around $110 US which seemed to be a pretty good deal to me. Other Tips: Depending on how many people are in your party, you might want to forego the packaged tours and just hire a taxi driver to take you around for the day. One day we had a taxi driver take us to El Paraiso beach near Tulum (my favorite beach) and there is a little beach club there where you rent beach beds, eat, swim etc. I love this place! My idea of true paradise. On another day we hired a taxi driver to take us to the Coba ruins and then afterwards to drop by El Paraiso again for lunch. This cost about $65 per person excluding food and drink and we got to leave at a reasonable hour - not 7am and we got back two hours before the tour groups. One major disappointment to me was the distance of this resort from Playa. It is a half hour cab ride during the dinner hour and as someone else mentioned about $20 one way. I think if I were going to do this trip again, I would stay closer to Tulum - maybe in the Tulum hotel zone, because I am a beach person, but that is just me. I have stayed in Playa before, and if you want to make use of Playa (ie you want nightlife) you should just stay in playa. The beach there is nicer and there is lots of nightlife. As someone mentioned, this resort has no nightlife which was in contrast to the MP in Nueva Vallarta where there was a very lively lobby bar. In any event, if you go you will have a nice time.

The Grand Mayan was a beautiful, relaxing resort with some minor drawbacks. Each resort has its own strengths and weaknesses, the GM included. Our trip had a slightly rocky start. Our plane arrived in Cancun approximately 1/2 hour late. We moved through customs quickly and soon were walking toward the Hertz car rental booth. A short Mexican man immediately told us our car was not available. I asked to make a call to Hertz headquarters but he said his phone wasn't working. I asked for the number but he gave me the wrong information. I came back and asked when I could receive a car; once again, he said there were no cars despite having a reservation and a confirmation (on-line). Then I asked for the phone number again and he picked up his broken, non-working phone and called. I spoke to a man named 'Rodriques' who said a car would be delivered (the second lie from Hertz). A little frustrated at this point I received help from the two men in the booth next to me (Avis). They said that the cars were given out on a first come, first serve basis and that the reservation system at this time of the year didn't work. I had this fact confirmed several times over inc. a statement from Hertz themselves that Mexico was a different company with different services. At this point I wondered whether Hertz would take any responsibility at all. To end the first part of our story, Avis helped us find the Grand Mayan bus and we made it to the hotel. The resort is an exquisite place - beautiful rooms, excellent service, picturesque grounds. My wife and I are fit so we found the walking around the resort easy. However, most people took the small tram or electric carts around the place. The drawbacks were a non-swimming beach (though you could walk 15 minutes north and swim), noisy rooms (hallway noise reverberate throughout the room - yelling or loud voices at times seemed to be right in the room; we could also hear the people next door talking), and access to Puerto Morelos. We finally were able to get a car from Hertz. However, we were lied to again. Come at 8 am the next day. No car. We came again the next day. No cars. After some negotiation a woman said come back at noon. We arrived at 10 am after wandering around Playa del Carmen, guessing that the cars would be given away again. We lucked out this time on our third day of trying (we checked out other places but everything was too expensive during the peak season). The car we received was of lower quality and cost more than initial Hertz estimates. We rented a car for a week. The advantage was getting to Tulum and other sites early in the morning before the swarms people arrived, entering the sites shoulder-to-shoulder, and banging cameras against each other getting pictures. The disadvantage was insurance. We were partly covered through VISA but I took out extra liability and personal accident insurance. The only way to be truly covered is with the exorbitant Hertz local coverage. The other week we caught the collectivo across the highway from the entrance of the resort. You can get a electric car to the entrance and back. You can also take a collectivo to Puerto Morelos, which has great beaches, but you will have to walk from the highway to the beach unless you catch a cab at this point. The express collectivo is a $1.50 and the other collectivo is $2 or 20 pesos. The resort has a shuttle three or four times a day to Walmart. This is $7 dollars return but you will have to walk into Playa del Carmen. We had a good trip. My wife loved the resort. I didn't really like the noisy room. We live in the country and probably are too used to quiet. We did see a tapir come over the fence one day from the mangroves.

We (2 adults and a 2 year old) had an amazing time in Mexico. We met our friends 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 9 and 11), it was their timeshare. They reserved a three bedroom suite. Their suite with kitchen, living room and big tub (separate shower) along with their one bedroom that had a King sized bed. A small tiled pool was on their balcony as well. Our suite had a Jacuzzi tub (separate shower too) and sofa that would sleep a couple kids. The king size bed was large enough for us three. Our suites adjoined as did our balconies. We could have fit another couple comfortably between us. This was a roomy retreat. A beautiful, relaxing and cozy place to stay!!! TIMESHARE - Remember this is a time share so you will be asked to visit a sister site. We were offered a 10% discount on our bill (see credit card hold section) and discounts on day trips. We declined and found it to be a good decision. There are plenty of BETTER offers from the competition. We were told NOT to accept offers from the other timeshares. They frown upon it and won't allow anyone inside to pick you up from another resort. You solve that by meeting outside the gates. You are not the first and won't be the last to do this. CREDIT CARD HOLD - Upon arrival a hold for $600 (or was it $800, sorry) will be put on a credit card. All food, drinks and shopping will be added to a tab. You can't pay with cash inside the resort; it all goes on the tab. Upon check-out you settle up. GRAND MAYAN RIVIERA MAYA RESORT - There are several pools and shops. The biggest pool has drink specials everyday. Ask your server what they are. It does take quite some time before the server comes back around. We resolved that issue by ordering a couple drinks at once. There is volleyball in the main pool as well as a DJ. The atmosphere is fun fun fun. The scenery is beyond beautiful. You are surrounded by lush palm trees and other vegetation. We saw a couple large iguanas walk across the path. If you can, catch a sunrise. THE BEACH - Walking distance to a rocky beach on the resort, but it's a must see. It is not all that bad. RESORT SHUTTLE: Wasn't the best but remember you are on vacation -take it easy and don't sweat the small stuff. You might take a shuttle to downtown Playa del Carmen and get a taxi back. It's worth the little extra money. As for getting around the resort itself, we walked much of the time. But we were lucky enough to be in the closest building. We did catch shuttles and had to use one to get to the main gate as well. RENTAL CAR - We reserved a rental car at the same time we bought our airline tickets. We had it for 4 days and dropped it at the airport once we left. Get there early because the wait was long returning the car!!! The line at the airport was long too, beware! OTHER PLACES WE RECOMMEND TO VISIT (outside resort): DOWNTOWN PLAYA DEL CARMEN - Be prepared to walk a lot. There are plenty of shops, restaurants and the beach - so take some swim gear. The scenery is amazing too. We were approached by time share people and accepted an offer to tour a resort in exchange for tickets to Xel-Ha which included an air conditioned ride to and from. We toured their resort the next morning; they picked us up, gave us a tour, tried to sell hard and brought us back to the resort. We received 4 adult and 2 child tickets to Xel-Ha. The next morning the bus was outside our resort to pick us up. They were nice enough to offer to drop us in downtown Playa del Carmen on the ride home. It was worth the tickets - for sure!!! XEL-HA - This is an eco friendly water wonder. Lots to do - swim with dolphins or snorkel in the huge lagoon (I think they call it an open aquarium), beach, hammocks, bicycles and plenty of restaurants - all you can eat and drink (alcohol too) is included in entrance fee. There are parrots and other beautiful birds free to roam. There are some trained ones that you can have a picture taken with. To purchase tickets would have been 100 per person with the bus ride. Here is a quote from their website: \"Xel-Ha is here to open the eyes. To thrill the senses. To nourish the soul\". Indeed it did! CANCUN - We drove to downtown Cancun (about 40 minutes) plenty to do and see. COZUMEL - We took a ferry from downtown Playa del Carmen to Cozumel. It was air conditioned and didn't cost much. What a beautiful place to see. The water was pretty clear and the scenery so breath taking. Lots of restaurants and shops. Nightlife looked to be fun, but with the kids we had to opt out :) CHICHEN ITZA - A little over 3 hour drive. One of the Seven Wonders of the World, amazing. Buy a HAT at the entrance, the sun is HOT and it's a lot of walking. There are trees for shade and rest. Plenty of people selling goods, talk to them. One guy we spoke with told us some pretty amazing facts about the place. MERIDA - On our drive back from Chichen Itza we stopped here for dinner. We ate at a local restaurant. I took some great pictures here. Don't be afraid to eat the local food, just be careful of the items you choose. Drink bottled water, beer, soda, etc... Also make note if you drink milk, make sure it's homogenized. I did get sick on our last day there. I am certain it was something I ate, but would make the same choices again!", "Date": "January 24, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Antonio", "Title": "\u201cenjoyable stay at the grand mayan\u201d", "Author": "tamra", "ReviewID": "UR23698313", "Content": "We just got back from a week at the grand mayan. compared to several other posters we enjoyed our stay, but a little advance planning went a long way towards the trips success. This resort is far from all of the action in playa, which is where the best beaches and restaurant selections are to be had. To fully get the most enjoyment from your trip, I would advise fellow travelers to either reserve a rental car or plan your budget to include cab fare, which can be expensive. The hotel offers a shuttle to town. For grand mayan guests this picks up right near building number 8. It costs about $3pp- and drops you off at the Wal-mart. The problem with the shuttle is that the times are limited, and you are still a long way from the \"strip\" -i.e. the main shopping ave. and the beach. We rented a car part of the trip and cabbed it/shuttled it prior to the car rental. Of all the options we tried, the car rental worked the best for us, in terms of ease of parking-convenience of going to different places-the beach club to the bar with the band for example. We made our reservations with Alamo before we left and saved over 50% on the rates they were charging for people who booked once they got here. we waited to book the car as there was no real weekly price break, and figured what days we would need it- as the shuttle from the airport was included with our stay. If you do take the shuttle to wal-mart or drive to town for groceries I would recommend to walk two blocks and shop at the mega mart? versus the wal-mart, which is more expensive and geered more to the tourist trade. When I went into the wal-mart, they were out of limes and maple syrup and the bathrooms were not very clean. I had an opportunity to go into the other store later and buy limes, and there appeared to be a much larger selection of items at lower prices. I would also agree with fellow posters, that the swimming at the beach at the resort is not the best. However, more of the guests hang out by pool, so the beach itself isn't very crowded to sit and wave watch- which is what I like to do at the beach rather than actually \"swim\". We ventured into town with our grown kids, ages 27 and 18 to Mamacita's beach club- entrance is near 28th ave. They have a live DJ and a more happening ,sandy ,people watching type of beach. Had the kids not been with us, I would have been content to venture to mamacitas one day and hang out at the Grand Mayan beach the other days.. but based on the price of hotel drinks - our kids would have bankrupted us if we hadn't spent the beach days in town. We also enjoyed a band in town on Thursdays, from 5-9 (also plays on Saturdays) at Dave Bad boys beach bar by 4th ave. Great beach music, versus the rest of the beach clubs, etc.. which tended to play techno and lots of latin music, rather than my opinion of great beach music. As to the room itself at the Grand Mayan, I can't say enough positive compared to other posters. Yes, there is sometimes a musty smell- but i have found this a common problem with beach properties due to the humidity, etc. and is not really an indication of how clean the room is. so I brought along a bath and body works air freshner in my luggage- and we were never bothered by the occasional musty smell that I smelled when we first checking into the room. Other than the musty smell, the room was cleaned spotlessly on a daily basis. My husband, who I have proclaimed a \"neat freak\"- could only suggest that the clear plexiglass on the balcony which had water spots on it, needed to be cleaned with windex... If that's the only problem-- bring it on. The maid staff, who are not responsible for cleaning your dishes, would also wash whatever empty cups,etc. we left behind. I had also packed my own pillow, as the last time I stayed on property(about a year earlier) my pillow was unbearable- and I didn't want to risk it happening again. This time, some of the pillows were what I term unbearable, however there were at least a couple, while not down, etc.. that would have been sufficient- and on future trips I would probably not go to the trouble of bringing a pillow from home. We also spent only one night on the very hard mattress, and the next morning I called housekeeping (as fellow posters suggested) for an egg crate topper- and this made the bed sleep tolerable. We had occasion to call for maintenence one evening due to a bathtub that wouldn't drain and an in-room safe that was stuck closed. We called around 11pm after dinner at Tramonto- and were amazed that within 10 minutes both a plumber was dispatched and the man who opens the safe. Turns out our plumbing problem was due to \"operator\" error- we didn't know how to turn the drain---and was fixed in less time than it took to call, But, I was still amazed at how fast service was dispatched. Again- other posters complained about parking- in building 8 parking was very near our building and we never had trouble finding a parking spot, and we never needed to use the valet park. One complaint about the property was that the phone charges to use the hotel phone were very expensive. I only add this because I didn't intend to have to use the hotel phone, but our daughter got left behind one day- while we toured Chitzen-Itza, and between the calls to us, even getting our voice mail, and calls to friends back home, it cost us a fortune- as she didn't understand how the charges were calculated. The hotel did offer us a very small adjustment, which I thought was considerate- since she did in fact make all of these calls. The other thing we really didn't like about the property was having to shuttle around to different areas/buildings and wait for shuttles. Since our group did not spend that much actual time on property- it wasn't really an issue for us. We really enjoyed the Tramonto restaurant. I made reservations before we left the states for our first night on property to celebrate our son's birthday. We were reservation number 1- and we were shown directly to our table without any wait and were treated like royalty. The food and presentation was wonderful (my husband is east coast italian- and we are very selective about our pastas). There was also a violin player that night that we enjoyed. After dinner we had drinks outside in these \"beds\" with a nice breeze blowing in from the ocean, a perfect evening. Why I like the resort can be summed up as follows: it's a perfect launching pad. We could cook breakfast in our room before heading out- with the benefit of having great accomodations for a family - we had a grand mayan suite- whichs consists of two king bedrooms and a living room/dining/kitchen. The kitchen, although there is no oven, is fully apointed with cooktop, coffee maker, blender, wine opener, toaster, small sized refrigeraotror (not really large enough to hold fixings for dinners- more for breakfast items and appetizers- salsa, wine, beer, etc..)I would not consider staying at this hotel if I didn't have a car or was unwilling to spend money on cabs.- as there is not enough entertainment, restaurant choices, etc.. to keep me occupied. The only thing I really don't like about the rooms is that the units do not have ocean views- which I prefer. If I wasn't traveling with the kids and need the space- and the option of cooking in, versus constantly taking a whole family out for meals- I would probably choose a resort that offered beachfront rooms.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greensboro, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGrand Mayan was wonderful\u201d", "Author": "sdthompson", "ReviewID": "UR23522253", "Content": "I booked this resort through RCI as a second honeymoon for my husband and myself.

Everywhere you want to go you will need to find transporatation ,there is nothing within walking distance. The resort itself is beautiful, you will feel like you are in a tropical paradise. The food is OK but overpriced but you should already expect that. Be prepard to tip for every little thing, but just sit back and relax by the giant pool. The resort is so large with different parts that you could take one day to just explore the resort itself. The rooms are just like they are pictured on the website and the staff are very nice. I would suggest this resort if you are looking for luxury and you don't want to be in the hustle and buslte of downtown Cancun.

Our main party was at Iberostar (IB) for a wedding which gave us several days to sample both experiences. I will attempt to avoid repeating the information found elsewhere in the other reviews but try to aid someone making a choice between GM and Iberostar or first timers to Riviera Maya. Some boundary conditions to aid in establishing context. 1] It was high week of high season, both results were full. 2] The weather/water were 82F/78F, sunny, light breezes making the surf fun and accessible all week. No issues, in fact, perfect. 3] We had no bizarre events to contend with (Palapas en fuego...) 4] We rarely RCI trade our home resort @ Poipu Point embassy suites in Kauai..our expectations are high for any trade. 5] 1.00 US$ = $12.00 Pesos 6] Family of 4,mid 40's kids aged 15 & 12. We observed the following major differences in the order of importance to us: BEACH: At present , Iberostar is blessed with and wide, sandy entry and good conditons for body surfing. In contrast, the entry in front of GM is rocky: We needed to walk 13min north from the pier, to the Valentine, to match the Iberostar. We knew this, we did this, it was fine. A few small stretches required sandals. Beach/proper: The GM beach had many palm trees w/ filtered shade options, and alot more room between lounge chairs...IB was packed with chairs (You will meet people! ) and had umbrellas fewer trees for shade. These are huge resorts, but the GM beach handles the crowd better and looks more like a Corona commercial. As big as the beaches are there is not alot of room to throw football or frisbee at either. For that, or a real Corona commercial go to Akumal, Xpu-ha or go low season. ADVANTAGE: Iberostar because you can get into the water and play conveniently. Good chance of meeting high school/grammer school friends, just look around, they're nearby. FOOD This is a big consideration because these resorts sit about 1Km apart on a remote section of the coast nearly equidistant from Cancun to the north & Playa to the south. Your 20min from anything on a high speed - 3rd world video-game like highway. If you stay at either you will eat at them either always or ALOT. www.locogringo.com has excellent sequential aerial photography all along Riveria Maya that gives an excellent feel for the lay of the land. Highly recommend to study before you go. IB is all -inclusive (AI). Our family purchased full day bracelets which gave us AI-priveleges throughout the resort. $US 100.00 adult, & $75.00 kids. The resort kindly considered both our children kids eventhough we declared both to be older than 12. That was nice. This was our first AI experience, and I am glad we only 'sampled' it. Food was nearly universally buffet-style and you needed to get there at the right time to avoid selection issues or competition from bees. I cant imagine spending a full week in this mode. There is no way our family of 4 consumed $350.00 that day of food/drink , though i personally did my best to drain the Dos-Equis amber. Now in fairness, other members of the group staying the full week at IB had a 'guarantee' for 4-sit down, made to order meals at one of the many restaurants. But after day3, they hadnt yet successfully yet secured a reservation. I found that dissappointing as the you would think the father of the bride , who brought 40 folks to IB would get some preference. I dont have the benefit of thier opinon on how those meals turned out. Some reviewers complained about watered-down drinks at AI. I can say the beer/tequila at IB was fine. Avoided mixed drinks. Also consider that w/ AI, when your sitting poolside or @ beach and you want a beer or whatnot, you go find it. On the positive side, I was shocked & relieved you could get high quality tequila, such as Hornitos (vs. undrinkable Cuervo), in most bars. By contrast, GM is pay as you go, and has adequate help staff asking if you need anything. We did not have a bad meal anywhere. Some things, such as the shrimp cervice at Havana Moon right on the beach were the best I had anywhere. As others noted, the formal Italian Tramonto carried no price premium depsite its upscale presentations. All restaurants seemed to have plenty of choices and we successfully brought our way too picky kids everywhere. Really nice dinners averaged ~ US$100.00 for 4 with bottle of excellent Argentinian Malbec, very reasonable we thought. Service was never an issue at GM, even when we were locked-out of our own room when failing to return from IB late on new years eve. As others noted, room service was excellent, hot, and served w/o premium though wine selection is limited and entire menu is limited after 10PM. ADVANTAGE: Grand Mayan POOL: Both are the largest and most extravagent we had ever seen anywhere. Both were very clean and w/o overwhelming chemicaI stench..never felt like i had to shower ASAP after pool exit. IB had a closed-in but linked expansiveness. GM was more open and simply staggering in its size. More importantly, IB pool cleared out at sunset because it was just to cold in the evening. Nights cooled to low 70s. The GM main pool was warm, ..many folks at the swim up bar until 10PM. If that was to warm for you, the Mayan Palace pool was noticeably cooler. If you stay at GM you get access to all pools including the GM-only , LED lit \"G\" pool which had the fancy, diverse, and even luxurious outdoor furniture i have ever seen..would look completely at home in any living room. Recommend beach, but if pool is important, ADVANTAGE: Grand Mayan GROUNDS: Both resorts are meticulously manitained and very clean. The sheer effort to keep the jungle under control to produce the gardens, especially in the case of Iberostar, is truly impressive. When you consider the scale of these places...its truly amazing. GM was more open, less diverse & dense in flora, perhaps its much newer. IB was lush enough to host many critters including caoti, large number of unidentifed and exotic-sounding birds, and the occasional peacock on you lanai. Both are very nice but ADVANTAGE: Iberostar ROOMS: IB we saw are well appointed hotel rooms. Three may be condo-like rooms available, but the members of the wedding were in what you get at the high-end Disney resorts, a nice, comfortable, clean, but nevertheless, hotel room. GM was a condo with a kitchenette w/ very high quality appliances (killer Krups blender in particular) separate king-master w/ giant soaker tub & /LCD flatscreen for your subtitled viewing pleasure.. We cooked big breakfasts everyday and never ran into a utnesil/cookware issue. Very, very nice and important to us. We'd see some folks on the roomy lanai all day- every day. If the pool or beach scene aint you thing, the GM has fabulous lanai..with your own cooling pool. Be careful, the older Mayan Palace is also hotel room, and the GM suites are highly configurable with doors to create suites out of adjoing hotel rooms. You get what you pay for. The rack rate for our room was US$525.00...a sum we never paid for a nights lodging and a pleasant reminder of why we timeshare. We knew about walk reduction through lower bldg #, and were able to move from #11 to #9 at check in. As traders, not owners, during high season, we were suprised they would move us at all. BTW, we enjoyed the walk from bldg #9, but wee see how some folks would freak with anything more than edificio 5. We'd see some people on their very roomy lanai all day, every day. Id say views at Iberostar are superior to GM because of layout and garden quality. GM gives you either golf course or empty lot/recovering jungle view with IB lit like Vegas strip to south in the distance. Ask to be on North side if bldg number is greater than 5. Surprisingly, neither offers much chance of oceanview despite being oceanfront resorts. Dont stay in the room, but if you must, ADVANATAGE: Grand Mayan SUMMARY/OTHER CONSIDERATIONS I gave the Grand Mayan experience a 4/most likely because as nice as it is, it has an important area of improvement: beach access (which could swap fortune with the Iberostar with the next hurricane), and the Time-share pressure at check in. The Frommer guy is right, approach these folks as you would an injured rhino, if you manage to escape, they'll call you in the room. You've been warned. Finally, we had a rentacar, did Tulum ruins, Dos-ojos cenote (twice!) and the Xpu-Ha beach and could recommend each. The later is tricky to find (enter Nortbound on the 307 at km265, there is a large PEMEX station across from the access 'road' on the southbound side. Locals man a gate and will request about $US10.00/car which includes showers, parking, and access to a very large, gorgeous, and uncrowded swimming (but not snorkeling) beach. We saw, but did not sample what looked to be excellent snorkeling at the north end of the beach road in Akumal. OK to skip the Playa Del Carmen Quintas Avenidas altogether. If you shop Playa for groceries, skip mega and go to walmart. Both are disorganized but adequate, mega has only evaporated milk, Walmart has fresh (but whole) milk. Rental was US$180.00 from Hertz @ CUN-airport. Some folks were paying &50.00 for taxi trips to Tulum. It was easy decision for us, but the driving there is defnitely not for the pre-playstation crowd or anyone w/ poor reflexes or a fear of military checkpoints. BOTTOM LINE #1: Despite our strong preference for direct beach access, WE PREFERRED GM to IB because the IB food was a deal breaker. Play close attention to IB-food or AI-food reviews in general. Our sample was limited, but it is tough for this format to compete w/made to order w/ high degree of service. IB has alot to learn from say, cruise lines, as you would never mistake this AI food for even Carnival quality. BOTTOM LINE #2: Would we trade our high-season, beachfront, Kauai resort for the Grand Mayan Riviera Maya? Yes we would. But, from the rent a car, we could see dozens of such high end places, some of which are RCI-accessible which makes exploring another resort a more likely option. Beside, GM is a once per 5 year trade.

Spend the money and stay in the Grand Mayan and not the Mayan as the Grand Mayan offers the pool on the balconies and the rooms are a little more luxurious. Here are some key points me and my husband wanted to share but feel free to contact me if you have other questions: PROPERTY The Mayan and Grand Mayan are on the same resort and separated by a huge golf course owned by Jack Nicklus. The resort is NOT a walking resot so there are mini trams to pick you up in front of your building and take you to various points throughout the entire resort. So make sure to plan ahead as the usual wait time was between 5-10 minutes. The grounds are emactualtey kept and you see the landscapnig crew out early from the poolside to the condos. Very impressive! The resort is cash-less which is wonderful becasue all you need is your room number and signature. when you first check-in, a scan copy of your signature is on file and then when you buy ANYTHING on the resort, you just sign the bill! Note that tips are included on EVERYTHING excepted the gift shop... FOOD The resort offered about 3-5 restaurants. You must try the Italian restaurant. But make sure to make a reseravtion well in advance (like the day before) to ensure you get a table. We made that mistake and got an available table at 9PM and we had called when they opened at 6! The Italian restaurant offered the best food and then second was the room service. The cuisine as American flare which is great but I did not see many Mexican choices. ROOM The best for last.... the room was amazing. It made me look at Wyndham in a whole different light! Our room look exactly how it does on their website... from the granite and marble to the flat screen TVs to the actual decor! I was very happy to get exactly what I expected. Good thing too, because it rained most of the time we were there so we had a great room to be in. OVERALL The one BAD thing about this place is the 90 minute presenation they SUCKERED us into for exchange of a free tour and peso credits. So the 90 minutes turned out to be almost 5 hours!! They soup you up about buying with them and blah blah blah. We just wanted the price. They start out at 150K USD!!! And that was not even for a unit similar to what we stayed in!!!!!!!!!!!!! I almost wanted to go home!!!!! The more we said NO the more they PUSHED!!! They even tried to make a payment plan with us for $115.00 USD per month for 25 yrs!!! I was blown away!!! So unless you want to get a free tour that is worth about $75 USD per couple or get like $100 USD in cash or a bottle of cheap liquor, and have about 150-250K to blow while on vacation, then GOOD LUCK!!!! DRINKS If you enjoy a good drink, then BRING YOUR OWN! You can buy a bottle and make drinks in your room. Otherwise the bartenders provide weak drinks. One night, I made friends with a bartender and the drinks were great. So you never know. ABOUT THE DRINKING WATER: The water here is safe although all Mexicans will generally advise against it. After asking SEVERAL people on the resort, I found that their was a filtration unit they used. So you can be safe and use bottled water like we did to brush yuor teeth and other stuff. But we did have a few drinks with ice in it and our stomachs were fine. ENTERTAINMENT They keep you onsite with a variety of pre-planned entertainment which are free except 1 which they told us about in advance. We did catch one one show during dinner and it was very amuzing. Before we knew it, they had us up stage dancing too!!! So this place is super romantic and worth the visit.

We've been coming to various Mayan properties since 1997, and we own two weeks in their network so I might be biased, but will try to be objective here. First of all, the resort is absolutely beautiful. The new Grand Mayan pool is phenomenal, and at night it's spectacular considering the soft blue lighting. Once the palapa over the pool is complete, it will be a great place to get out of the hot sun. Here's a summary in bullet format regarding our most recent stay: - We had a first floor room in building 9. The shuttles came often but even then we decided to walk to/from the pool half the time. It only took about 8 or 9 minutes if you know the shortcuts and it's a very beautiful walk. One day I walked back and forth for three round-trips and if anything I got a little workout. I'm out of shape and 50 years old so please stop complaining about the darn shuttles. Just start walking and in most cases someone will slow down and ask if you want a ride. - The staff was great. Everyone is extremely friendly, and the lobby staff talks very good English. The maids this trip were very very good, unlike some of our previous visits. - We rented a car for one day from Executive Car Rental down the street from the resort. They picked me up at the golf course and the price was actually less than quoted on the phone. The Mayan concierge helped us with the reservation. Apparently the Alamo agency on-site was out of mini-vans. We paid 130 for the day, and that included all the insurance and everything. Please watch yourself at the Pemex gas station down the road though. I handed the guy a twenty, a five, and a one for a total of 26 dollars. After turning around to get back in the car, the guy tapped me on the shoulder and displayed the five, and two ones, implying that I only gave him seven dollars. Fortunately, one member of our group was a high-school Spanish teacher and he got out of the car and chewed him out. Problem solved. - Our day trip in the rental van included Coba and Tulum. Both were very interesting, but on our next trip I will just spend the entire day in Tulum. They have a beautiful beach, and lots of places to shop and eat. Driving in Mexico was easier than negotiating the beltway in DC. And I firmly believe their drivers are better as well. - Playa del Carmen was a blast, and we had a fantastic Mexican Fiesta platter at one of the upstairs restaurants on 5th avenue. Can't remember the name right now. The couple at the table next to us ordered one of the flaming desserts and the waiter made a show out of the event. It was great and the guy was amazing. He was pouring the flaming liquor from glass to bowl and back again. I would have burned the place down trying to do that. - We took the snorkel trip offered by the Mayan and had a wonderful time. It was $46 per person, and we were gone from 12:30 to 5 pm. We snorkeled at two spots, and stopped at a deserted beach for an hour to play soccer and partake in some Cerveza. Oh yeah, it was open bar (beer & soda) for the entire trip as well...included in the price. Book this trip through Marcello or one of the British dive guides at the water activities palapa on the beach. The boat comes right to the beach so you don't have to worry about a van trip anywhere. They supply the gear, but next time will bring my own if possible. My fins left a blister so I'd prefer the type where you wear the booties next time. - Restaurants: Tramanto is the place to go, as other reviewers have said. And if you want one of the best meals ever, order the Chateau Briande (spelling?). It's around 52 dollars, but it's a complete meal for two, and one of the best cuts of meat I've ever had. One of the couples on our snorkel trip said they had been back to Tramonto twice already just for that meal alone. Make your reservations early though. Friday was booked solid the entire day, but I ended up scoring a table for six by pleading with the hostess. Surprisingly, she gave us a reservation over the phone. Needless to say, I made sure to tip her as much as we did the waiter. Havana Moon Restaurant: Absolutely terrible! Will never go back. I think it was a three hour ordeal getting in and out of there. Everything took forever, we were totally ignored, and when the food did come it was stone cold. I sent my plate back to be reheated, and it came back cold again! One member of our family ordered a tuna dish, and before we even left the restaurant he was breaking out in a rash. When his heart started racing we had to call the on-site doctor when we got back to the room. I will say the medical staff is excellent. According to the doc, they serve a type of tuna in that area of Mexico that is different from what we're used to in the states. The doc gave him two shots, and some pills to take over the next two days. Within an hour or two he was back to normal, and asleep. The rash was completely gone in the morning. The bill came to roughly $200 cash, but considering the consequences of doing nothing, we thought that was reasonable for a room service doctor. He spoke very good English too. Room Service: Outstanding! My wife and I were hooked on room service. Average bill for the two of us was around 30-35 dollars, and the service was excellent. And we thought the food was very, very good. Our friends who came with us loved room service so much that they started using it for breakfast too. Apparently the stuffed french toast is great from what they said. Timeshare Presentation: Please, please don't do it. Even if you succeed in saying \"NO\" for three hours, you'll regret the lost pool time, and you'll be upset the rest of the day. It's really not worth the 100 dollars and 10% off your bill. And the 10% doesn't even apply towards your bar bills or anything alcoholic, which was the bulk of our bill. If you really love the place and want to buy into the network, you can do that anytime during the week. The year we bought, we talked to several people at the pool who did buy, found out a general range for price, and as one of the sales guys walked past the pool we told him we would pay x amount, and he had one hour to complete all the paperwork. I remember standing there next to the pool dripping wet, and signing all the paperwork. Much easier that way. Or you can come back home and shop online for really good deals. But then again, you can rent an owners week through some of the online places, and pay about the same as you would anyways, so why buy? - Mosquitos: Please bring your bug spray. They're not bad at all, except around 5-6 pm in the lobby area. One night the fogger guy was spraying the grounds and I could swear there was a swarm of mosquitos trying to escape extermination. Each of us ended up with five or six bites that night while waiting for the tram in front of the lobby. That's the reason we started walking to/from building nine. I never saw a mosquito on the path to/from the room. Okay, enough detail. I think you'll love the Grand Mayan!! We did, and that's why we return every year. This was our third consecutive year at the Riviera Maya location. Next year it's back to Acapulco. I really don't understand some of the negative reviews on this site. Despite the bad service at one restaurant, and the night we were attacked by mosquitos, our group had one of the best vacations of our life this year. If you come expecting to have fun, and realize this is a very nice four-star property (by US standards anyway), and also if you realize that you're a guest in a foreign country, all will be fine and you'll have a good time.

When we arrived, we were extremely impressed with the expansive and beautiful lobby/check-in. (Note: the Grand Mayan is the sister property to the Mayan Palace, which has its own lobby/check-in). The check-in staff was extremely pleasant and helpful and spoke excellent English. Off to the side, there is a timeshare operation set up, and immediately upon check-in, the sales staff approach you, which I found irritating. After receiving a 10% discount on the entire week's bill, a $100US credit, free use of the gym and spa, and a golf discount, we decided to listen to the sales presentation the next morning. We were picked up in a shuttle (which took a little bit of time) to go to our room. These are some of the disappointments of this property - its huge size and poor use of the beach. The buildings are numbered 1 through 15 (I think is the last building). As the numbers go up, they become increasingly far from everything - pools, beach, restaurants, gym, etc. Additionally, none of the buildings make use of the beach views, which was incredibly disappointing. Also note: the beach was wiped out during Hurricane Wilma three years ago, and the resort does not plan to \"rebuild\" the beach until May 2009. We got to our room (the studio size) and were extremely impressed - the decor was simple yet contemporary and clean, and every room had a jacuzzi tub and balcony with two reclining lawn chairs (no views though). Since we arrived fairly late, we opted to order room service. I highly recommend NOT doing this - the food arrived cold and was not at all well prepared. The next morning, we attended the sales presentation and were again impressed by the beauty of the property. The pools are probably the best feature of this place, with great attention to detail with landscaping and cleanliness. Additionally, the poolside staff (both bar and roaming) were extremely attentive and friendly. However, the food and drink prices were extremely expensive, so the next morning, we opted to take a hotel shuttle ($3.50US pp) to nearby Playa del Carmen (20 minute drive), which has a Wal-Mart. We purchased breakfast and lunch food for the week, as well as beer, liquor, mixers, and a cooler. I HIGHLY recommend doing this to save some money, as a typical dinner at the hotel (with drinks) ran us no less than $100-120US each time. Back at the resort, the only restaurant I'd recommend would be Tramanto (Italian). The food here was excellent and the staff (once again) was meticulous. If you are a wine buff, avoid the wine at all cost however. For being such a nice resort, we found the restaurants had a poor selection of wines (if they even had our selection available in the first place). Anyhow, all the other restaurants on site were mediocre. Occasionally, we'd get a pizza as an afternoon snack, which were pretty decent. Onsite, the resort offered quite a bit to do. We opted to dive with the dive shop a couple of the days and were very impressed with the knowledge, personality, and helpfulness of the staff. They offer cenote (cave) dives, which we highly recommend!!! The other activity we did was to go to Chichen-itza. We didn't want to do the tour bus route, so we rented a car from Alamo Car Rental, which is onsite. We also opted to drive the rollroad (which they don't even tell you about). Most tours and cars take a non toll road, which takes about 3-3.5 hours EACH way, but has plenty of stops. The toll road takes about 2-2.5 hours each way, BUT has only one stop and also costs $50US roundtrip. Chichen-itza is highly worth the trip - and spring for the private tour guide ($45US for a 3 hour tour)... A couple nights, we opted to go into Playa del Carmen for dinner. We would take the shuttle from the hotel (the final shuttle ran at 6pm) and cab back (about $20US). Definitely make a day or night trip into Playa, as 5th Ave (the main street) has tons of cute shops and restaurants. All in all, the Grand Mayan Riveria Maya was a beautiful resort, wiht many offerings and an impressive landscape. Additionally, the staff/service is probably the best thing about the property - everyone we met was incredibly friendly and helpful, and most spoke English fluently. We were most disappointed by the beach, the restaurant options (with the exception of Tramanto), the huge size of the property (and often late shuttles to take you from building to building). All in all, I'd give this place a 4 out of 5 stars.

Be warned it is still under construction in parts. What a huge complex it is. Extremely impressive looking hotel, I have never seen anything like it. The Grand Mayan has its own exclusive pool, expect privacy cabanas and gorgeous tropical gardens. There is an unusual smell around the pool area, similar to the smell of vomit, I think its coming from the freshly stained wooden floors. Be careful, if you have a keen sense of smell, it turned me off. There are pools absolutely everywhere. The beach is quite nice too only for lounging but don't plan on going in the water, it is slippy, rough and rocky, a hard combination in bare feet. The first day is quite overwhelming (the timeshare people at the airport, the timeshare people at the car rental agency and also the timeshare people in the front lobby that the reception desk will send you to to find out information about the hotel-they say! The Grand Mayan pool bar was closed the the whole week we were there, apparantly it opens in November. Waiters were scarce but did run from the smaller pool area.. The remainder of our time the Grand Mayan pool was also closed as they haven't finished the thatched roof over the pool so we spent the remainder of our pool time at the Mayan Palace pool. Happy hour was 11-1, we found quite early, but if youre in the mood to start drinking at breakfast ,it works. You can also catch the pool scence activities. At 1pm they teach you how to make cocktails and give out free drinks for 1/2 an hour - quite entertaining. The restaurants we thought weren't really geared to a young family of four, I dont think we left a restaurant without our bill being under $150. We stayed in building seven, a 2 bedroom suite closest to the pool, they told us, easily a ten minute walk! The kids enjoyed the Crocodile pond that we had to walk by each day. Take bug spray - there are tonnes of mosquitoes as there is a large open area of green water and tropical bushes harbouring the bugs. The best restaurant is Tramonto a great steak house, fantastic food! Expect average American/Canadian restaurant prices, there are no great Mexican deals here. Maybe it was the time of year we went, but we moved rooms as the ground floor room had a bad smell of mould and a huge hurricane screen. we moved up to the third floor and asked for the huge hurricane screens to be moved from the balcony. Some rooms have hurricane screens, some rooms don't. We heard many different excuses why they couldn't remove ours from the balcony, it made our room very dark and damp, not the ideal holiday suite. We complained each day until they finally removed it, the day before we left! At least they gave us a large credit on our hotel bill. We bought food at Walmart located in Playa del Carmen, we thought it offered the best deal in town compared to the other supermarket we used. The produce was not the best at Wal Mart.The room was kept immaculately clean by the maids, the waiters were extremely friendly, the bell boys drive you around by a golf cart shuttle as the resort is so big, overall a great hotel, a little too big for my liking and I would have liked a beach front room, but that isn't possible as the rooms run length wise. The resorts on the Mayan Riviera are all isolated, so car rental is recommended if you want to see anything. Our small car cost $100 for the week plus insurance of another $100. We drove to Tulum ourselves - entrance fee is 95 pesos about $10 Cdn.- peanuts really compared to the bus tour through the hotel. We figured driving to Tulum ourselves covered our car rental for the week, instead of taking the bus tour. We were on our way to visit the public beach area in Tulum which takes you down a beautiful road, you really feel you're in the jungle. We stopped for lunch at Ocho Tulum, highly recommended,very picturesque, my husband enjoyed the model photshoot. The beach was deserted, I felt like Robinson Crusoe! Reminded me of my backpacking days. I think the highlight of our trip was our visit to Akumal to snorkel with the turtles and stingrays - we did this by ourselves too. I recommend buying snorkelling equipment at home and just rent a lifejacket and flippers so you can stay out on the reef for as long as you like. Our snorkelling equipment for our family of four rented for about $120 and somebody else has used your snorkelling tube! Akumal and Ocho Tulum definate must see's if you are not into the commercialism of Mexico.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Francisco", "Title": "\u201cSplendid Resort Close to Everything!\u201d", "Author": "DALevy", "ReviewID": "UR21681384", "Content": "Two years ago while in Cabo San Lucas, the Mayan roped us into a timeshare presentation. The resorts ARE beautiful, and after several hours, we purchased two weeks, got home, realized much of what they said was NOT true, so cancelled the timeshare after days of haggling via eMail and telephone with their reps. This year, we used a weeks/points program we've had for years to book two weeks at he Grand Mayan. We are delighted that we did. With our trade, two weeks in a two bedroom suite cost less than $400 total. We are world travellers, have stayed in splendid places in Tahiti, Australia, Thailand, Japan, England, Ireland, Greece, Holland (and more) and consider the Mayan Palaces among the best of the best. Even though I don't particularly like the Mayan Riviera because the landscape is too flat for my tastes, we so enjoyed this trip, that we reupped our two weeks on a timeshare and are looking forward to the Mayan Palace in Argentina when that opens. My daughter did homework before leaving home on this trip and said we have to ask for Building One through Five. We got Building One, which is steps from the pool and close to all other amenities. We never waited more than 5 minutes for a shuttle, found the Mayan Riviera a good central location to visit Tulum, Chichen Itza, Xcaret, Xel-Ha, Isla Mujures, swim with dolphins, etc. It was also very easy and inexpensive to get into Playa del Carmen from the Grand Mayan. The food was superb, although we found it best at Tramonto (and reasonably priced!). They had an excellent band a couple of nights at the Havana Moon, which became a favorite 'cause of the atmosphere, along with Fridas near the pool. Thought the entertainment at the del Lago somewhat lacking and tasteless at one point: Young women in \"traditional\" costume, which turned out to be chaps with no bottoms. Really, folks. This was supposed to be a family show, not a poor rendition of a Las Vegas lineup. I didn't like the mosquito spraying and worry about the staff. That stuff is poison. Our favorite tours, in case you are heading to the Mayan Riviera, were Tulum/Xel-Ha, swimming with dolphins (with Dolphin Discovery -- they are highly regarded), and Xcaret Plus -- which was the highlight of the trip.

We were able to coordinate with another timeshare stay in Cozumel. We had a 2 bedroom suite and it was spacious and gorgeous. However, the mosquitos were so bad and we were so far away from the main part of the resort (building 12 at the Grand Mayan - quite aptly called The Jungle) that I was eaten alive despite conscientious use of repellant. My traveling companion has a minor hip problem so we tried to use the shuttle as much as possible which was incredibly unreliable. Even using the shuttles still left plenty of walking to get where you wanted to go. After dark it's pretty hard to find your way around by walking. Just trying to get to dinner would mean a wait for the shuttle of at least 30 minutes (while I was getting eaten alive by mosquitos). Most of the shuttle drivers spoke NO English. I became convinced that they wanted to delay diners' arrival at the buffet restaurant (Del Lago) in order to have an audience for their entertainment show. The shows weren't bad but one night the volume was so loud and we couldn't get our waiter's attention so we had to go to the maitre d's station to get our check. The food at the buffet was quite good. I'm very averse to spicy food but I always found plenty to eat and enjoyed being able to try things that I wouldn't be likely to order as an entree in a regular restaurant. Although it is possible to walk throughout the resort, the paths are not well marked and I felt like we spent too much of our vacation waiting for the shuttle or wandering around lost. Just trying to find the towel station took 15-20 minutes - after that we just took our own towels to the pool even though you're not supposed to. Unlike the other reviews, I found the pool areas to be quite shady - although we spent little time there. The Mayan Palace pool was quite cold. The Grand Mayan pool seemed warmer although for a couple of days they seemed to be working on it and the water level was really low. The \"river\" feature mentioned in a previous review is really a \"lagoon\" - not at all attractive and quite likely a good mosquito breeding ground. The laundry machines are a nice amenity but they are only open from 9-5, which meant I spent the better part of an afternoon doing laundry - I didn't find out about the availability of someone doing it for you until I'd already gotten my wash started. This is pretty typical - the information you are given about services is very bare-bones and out of date. It would have been nice to have the laundry available in the evening after the sun went down. The shuttle service definitely needs to be improved. They had several routes that it seemed to me could be combined so they could provide more frequent service. They never really said how often the shuttles ran - although there were \"clocks\" that supposedly showed when the next shuttle was due, they were rarely accurate. We did the time share presentation on a cloudy morning for the discounts offered. It probably took us 2 to 2-1/2 hours but wasn't that bad (having never been before it was interesting to observe their various tactics to dupe you into thinking you're getting a good deal). I'm an accountant and my traveling companion is in commercial real estate so there was no way that we were going to buy any deal that was arrived at by their \"chicken scratches\" on blank pieces of paper. My companion acquired his current time share through a private party at a very reasonable price - especially compared to what they were offering, even their rock bottom price.

We love the Iberostar chain in Playa and Paraiso Beach so we were curious to see how they compared. I tacked on a weekend at the Iberostar Maya after our week here, just to be sure our vacation would end on a positive note. Since we had no idea of where this hotel was, imagine our surprise when we arrived to find that this hotel was the VERY NEXT property to the Iberostar property at Paraiso Beach! So comparisons would be very direct. The properties must have been similar in size, but at the Grand Mayan it seemed that it took forever to walk from your room to the beach and restaurant area. I think that was due to the lack of landscaping along the way, and little shade. At Iberostar the walk is long, but you never notice it as you are always walking through beautifully decorated halls and courtyards. They don't run a shuttle at the Iberostar and they do at the Grand but it only runs every half hour from your room to the beach/restaurant area. Pluses - the pool area, if you are at the Grand Mayan side, not the palace, is exceptional, one of the nicest pools we have ever enjoyed. Service here is excellent. The rooms are almost as large as our condo in Chicago and their decor is wonderful. Great luxury in rooms all the way around. Also, they run a daily bus into Playa Del Carmen for only $3.75 which is a GREAT bargain - the Iberostar only has taxis which cost $25 each way plus tip. Other timeshare holders we talked to said this was the most beautiful property they had stayed at. The food at Tramonto was fabulous and really no more expensive than the lesser restaurants. Dine here first. Maid service was fantastic. Minuses - Your check in takes place in a big temporary tent. The balconey of many rooms were draped with big black tarp that made the hotel look pretty bad, I guess this was for hurricane protection. The hotel was rebuilding their lobby area, so anywhere you were there was super loud construction noise, and they seemed to be working around the clock. So you have this beautiful pool with construction noise and workers everywhere. Obviously, at some point this will end. Also, they had the practice of fogging daily in the evening. If you were waiting on the shuttle, a guy would come by in what looked like a space suit and point a machine that sprayed out bug spray, looked like tear gas in a raid. People would cover their faces and run back into the hotel. Food was very expensive, at least as high as downtown Chicago prices. A beer was $7 and most entrees were priced at $22 whether lunch or dinner. And it got pretty annoying that you always had to wait for your check even though they did not take cash and they always got your name and room number when you came in. The tip was included in the bill, why, did they have to make you wait? The evening shows were pretty lame. The beach was all rocks and you could not swim there. Very disappointing. If you have a timeshare, this is a wonderful place to use it.

It was the best trade we have done so far through RCI, and managed to get a 2 bedroom unit thanks to low season. the unit was huge, about 1300 sq ft, so we had a lot of room, which was really nice. It was just me and my husband, and our 18-month-old. I emailed the concierge several times prior to request a room close to the pools and amenities and we were in building 7, which wasn't too bad. (Buildings 1-5 were closed due to a fire) It was about a 7 minute walk to the pool and a 10 minute walk to the beach. Keep in mind the resort is HUGE, so if you are in one of the farther buildings you need to take a golf cart. The kitchens are pretty well-equipped, so I would recommend bringing cereal, snacks, Easy Mac, Shake & Pour Pancake mix, salt and pepper, napkins, coffee and filters, sweetner, peanut butter, etc.. with you. There is a store on the property where you can buy water, soda, milk, cheese, etc.. but there isn't a huge selection and it is pretty expensive. If you have a large family it may be easier to make one big trek to the WalMart in Playa and buy it there, but for a family of 3 I would recommend bringing the staples so you don't have to rush there the first day. The restaurants on-site were okay, but pretty pricey for what you get. We got sick of it pretty quickly and went to Playa del Carmen a few times for dinner. You can take the shuttle for $3.50 pp but a cab back is about $20. The resort is pretty boring in the evenings, so we liked to get out. Because we had a toddler with us we either sat on the beach (you cannot swim, it is too rocky), or at the Grand Mayan Pool where there is a make shift beach with sand and it is shallow.

We were checked into a 2 bedroom suite in building #9. They were more than willing to move us to a building closer to the pools the next day although we chose to stay in our room. We had a main level room that looked out to the back of the resort. Mostly trees and bushes. The Huricane curtains were down on many of the buildings as it was the season. The rooms are large, clean and very comfortable and provides great privacy for 2 couples. You can hear guests talking and walking in the hall at night. Staying in building #9 we always walked to the pool and only occasionally took the shuttle back. The path was well marked and an easy walk. The beach was great. We sat under a palapa and occasionally took a swin in the ocean (with our water shoes on) to cool off. The beach is so close to the pool that you can just run up and jump in to cool off as well. The Mayan Grand 'guest only' pool was great but there was no way to spend any time there until the new lobby is built. The construction noise was really unbearable. We did take advatange of the offers given by the resort sales people and spent one whole morning saying 'no' to buying. It was worth the time, the buffet breakfast was fantastic and we were given discount golf and credits to our final bill. Don't let anyone scare you about renting a car (we got all of the insurance so it was a bit pricey but split between two couples was saved money). With a car you can see the area at your own pace.

They all tell you \"Hi\" when you pass them. We didn't need to leave the resort...we did for one day. We took a trip to Playa. The beach was amazing in Playa but it is full of shops and most of them carry the same thing. ***Important note...if you are going shopping you need to carefully remove your bracelet. They know you are staying in a high dollar resort and will not go as cheep on items! Also, we got taken at a beach restaurant at the end of 4th street. They think Americans are stupid and you need to really watch your bill and ask how much EVERYTHING costs before you go.*** Back to the resort. This place is the place to go if you want to hang out and have a good relaxing time. We got to know so many amazing people. We went to the beach in the morning (yes it is rocky but you can walk in it about a couple feet in spots) and when it got to hot we walked up to the pool. We hung out at the pool bar by the sale building. Please become friends with our wonderful bar boys...Mauro & Victor. They took amazing care of us and we just loved them. Please tip them over what is on your ticket...they only make 33 cents an our and then tips. Also, talk to Marcello on the beach...he is in the scuba hut. He can tell you where to go in Playa if you need ideas. We had a lot of fun with him....tell him the Indiana girls said \"Hi\" if you talk to him. Make sure you drink during \"Happy Hour\" if you are planning to drink. You can't beat the 2 for 1. And also don't forget to ask what the drink of the day is because that drink is 2 for 1 all day. :) You can rent one of the pool huts for $30 but if you drink more than that at the bar they give it to you for free. I had read that it is harder to get one during busy season...not when we went. The pool is unbelievable. It has shallow spots to lay above the water in 2 spots and 2 water falls that you can lay on. Great place to get really tan and keep cool. Make sure you take at least SPF 45 and bring a couple of bottles. We went through a lot and we came home very tan. If you are a guest at The Grand Mayan they do have a private pool. I didn't go...not close to the beach. It is a beautiful pool though. The shuttles do come around quite often. We did have to wait at times or we walked. Not a long walk and the grounds are just amazing to look at. We ate at the Tramonto Restaurant and I had the Lasagna and another had Prime Rib. It was amazing...and don't forget to take your camera...beautiful place. ***They ask you if you want water...Fuji. It costs $7.00 a bottle...you might be able to ask for tap. We didn't know this till our bill came.*** We drank the tap water all week and no problems. Keep the big bottles you by, refill and freeze half at night. Then you are ready to go in the morning when you top it off with tap water. We also ate at Havana Moon Lounge great food and music. We ordered pizza at the pool bar for lunch. (very good) Room service is fast and the cheeseburger is wonderful. The guacamole is to die for!!! Make sure you try it at least once...the chips that come with it are also very tasty! We had an amazing time and we are planning another girls trip in a couple years back to The Grand Mayan!", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Pedro, CA", "Title": "\u201cTHE HUGE MAYAN RESORT, MUST READ:-)\u201d", "Author": "MikiVeliki", "ReviewID": "UR20227046", "Content": "Hello my trip advisor friends, ATTENTION THIS REVIEW IS FOR GRAND MAYAN RIVIERA MAYA, AND NOT FOR GRAND MAYAN PALACE, building that is only a 100 feet away:-)))) Be careful, don't wanna mislead you or misinform you:-( Just recently I had a chance to visit GRAND MAYAN RIVERA MAYA, one of the biggest and largest resort I have ever seen and experienced. If you are planning to visit this wonderful resort, please take a few minutes to read my review cause it will help you while making the right decision if this type of resort is for you or your family. First of all, if you are planning to party, if you can wait to start bar-hopping thru Cancun Zona Hotelera, just a litle reminder THIS RESORT is in THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, so it will take you some serious planning to find TACO STANDS, BARS, CANTINAS.....so, you YOUNG TRAVELLERS looking to hook up in Cancun are looking at the wrong place, Grand Mayan is NOT for you. If you are planning to HAVE COCKTAILS BY THE POOL, ENJOY SOME OCCASIONAL SHOWS, BUFFETS, SWIM AND PLAY OTHER DAYTIME SPORTS AT THE POOL AREA, HAVE SOME PIZZA, MARGARITAS AT ONE OF THE NICEST POOLS IN CENTRAL AMERICA, I higly reccomend Grand Mayan Resort. If you are planning to be CLOSE TO THE POOL, try calling in advance, like few weeks before your arrival and request LOWER BULDING NUMBER. Believe me, resort is devided into 15 different buidling and the higher the number it gets, the further from pool area you are heading.:-))) If you like GOLF and prefer being by the Golf Course, higher number buidings will work for you. I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST LOWER BUILDING NUMBER. We stayed in Buidlind No.2 and it was amazing. Close to the shopl restaurants and pools at the Resort The POOL AREA is amazing, with TWO in-water BARS, one openned till 5 p.m., another till 11 p.m., you can sip on your favorite cocktail, and still be in the water, chat with your family, or perhaps meet some other tourists. Order some good apetizers and munchies while still playing and sun tanning. I recommend their FUNGHI PIZZA, pretty good considering it's pool menu. THE BEACH IS EXTREMELY ROCKY, so do not expect all those turquoise colors in front of the resort. Few years ago, when Hurricane Wilma hit Carrieban side of Mexico, lots of rocks appeared at the resorts beachfront. You will need those protective shoes, extreme caution and good eye sight before you decide to take a walk, or God Forbid dive.:-))) DO NOT EXPECT the beach from those postcards you were getting all these years from your friends who visited Cancun. I will recommend some beaches at the end of my review:-) Pay attention:-)))) I probably WOULD NOT recommend to walk thru resort, there's nothing really to see, remember you're not in Manhattan or Vegas, you're in the middle of nowhere in Riviera Maya, 20 minutes from Playa Del Carmen and half an hour from Cancun hapennings. It's also extremely hot so I would recommend to hang by the pool or in the rooms. Speaking of rooms, facilites, rooms, kitchen, bathrooms, living areas ARE AMAZING. You will really love their daily room service, amazing kitchen and really fancy living areas. We did. If you are planning to rent a car, you can do so at the airport while picking up your luggage, or you can just rent for couple of days at the hotel. That's what we did. Instead of renting a car for full 7 days, we decided to see what we can visit around in a few days and rented for THREE FULL DAYS ONLY at the Front Desk of Grand Mayan. If you are planning to visit Cancun, you can take a cab for 30-35 USD it depends in what part of Cancun, Zona Hotelera you're planning to go. If you are planning to visit Playa Del Carmen you can take daily shuttle that leaves hotel three times a day for 3.50 USD...yes that's three dollars and 50 cents. If you don't like waiting, and prefer being on your own, like planning your schedule, than rent a car and you'll be in 20 minutes in Playa Del Carmen (South of Resort) and 30 minutes in Cancun (North of Resort) In that case you can perhaps visit Puerto Morelos, small fisherman town, Tulum, old archeological site, Cancun, Xel-Ha, and other snorkeling, shopping and other attraction in beautiful Riviera Maya. Recommended things to do: At the resort: Nightly show with Buffet at Del Lago restaurant, cocktails by the pool, kicking back in your room and ordering some room service if lazy to cook Outside of resort: Visiting Puerto Morelos, small fisherman town, looks really ethnic with huge Mayan Culture, nice waters, small port. Visiting Cancun and some local bars and restaurants, visiting Playa Del Carmen (5th Avenue), shopping in Playa, perhaps kicking back at the BEACH, The beach is extemely green, blue and turquoise. I am picking also beach close to KOOL BEACH CLUB restaurant. You can order some cocktails, jumo in their pool and still relax at the ocean. I am recommending Tulum's Playa Paraiso, just a mile away from archeological site where you can order some MANGO MARGARITAS at the restaurant \"Mezzanine\"...What a location! Wow! I am also recommending some occasional trips to Wallmart to Playa Del Carmen where you can buy some drinks, munchies, ingredients for your favorite dish and enjoy time at the room after long walks and sight-seeings. I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS RESORT, IT'S AMAZING, FRIENDLY, QUIET AND VERY UNIQUE. POOL IS ONE OF THE REASONS, BEING ONE OF THE LARGEST POOLS IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

The problem is the sea is unusable and very rocky. - Some of the services were a little patchy. Turndown service was hit and miss, concierge were helpful when there, but the desk would be unmanned for long periods, pool wait staff were not as available as one would have liked. - For internet access, you have to physically go the internet cafe, there is no wifi or network connectivity in the rooms.

We knew we wanted to tour as much of the area as possible. The resort is about halfway between Cancun and Playa del Carmen, which is important to know. Driving in Mexico can be scary, but if you can drive in a big city like Atlanta and live through it, you can drive in the city in Mexico. The rental car was about $220 for an entire week. We did not reserve a car beforehand, but easily found one at the airport. Recognizable companies like Avis, Hertz, etc exist with reasonable prices. Although there are still slight signs of recovery and rebuild from a previous hurricane with the makeshift lobby in a large tent, customer service and comfort is high priority. Step inside the makeshift lobby and you almost forget it's a tent because it's air conditioned and nicely decorated inside. Check in went smoothly, although parking is a bit frustrating. Once you get out of your car at the entrance to the lobby, the concierge takes the keys to your car, unloads your bags and sends your car with parking lot personnel to park the car in the lot. After check in is complete, you are then escorted to your room via golf cart and handed your keys back. Anytime you want to leave the resort, you have to get a ride from your room to the lot via golfcart. The resort is quite beautiful and our room was more than I could have ever expected. The photos I saw on this website and the ones I took to post from my experience really don't do it justice. We stayed in a first floor, one bedroom unit with a comfortable living room area, full kitchen, large separate shower and jacuzzi tub. The king size bed was so comfortable. The staff was so friendly! From the security entrance gate to the lobby with checkin to shuttle services to housekeeping-everyone was quite accomodating. The only warning I would give is that in the lobby while waiting on check-in, we were roped into taking a tour of the resort to make a timeshare purchase. It made us waste 3-4 hours of a day of our honeymoon. Othewise, it was fine. Housekeeping comes twice a day: first to check on linens and do general cleaning, then in the evening to turn down the beds and see that guests don't need anything. One entire day, we spent sightseeing around Cancun. We also paid the fee to go on the ferry to Cozumel another day. Very worth the money we paid to take the car. Some of the most beautiful, untouched beaches exist on this island! We drove down to Playa del Carmen to the open-air market. It was interesting to see some of the handmade goods. As for food, Playa del Carmen has a Wal-Mart so purchasing a few groceries there saved us money because the resort store was expensive. There are popular chains such as McDonald's and Subway, so no worries about finding food common to the US. We were able to cook some of our meals from our Wal-Mart shopping trip in our fully equipped kitchen. We also purchased snacks and beer there. We did eat one meal in a restaurant in downtown Playa del Carmen which was good. I have to admit that we were spoiled by eating at the buffet restaurant on the resort a couple of nights. Mexican Fiesta night is well worth the money spent. It's a huge Mexican stage show with music and dancing, complete with all the food and drink you can stand. Anything you can imagine is served. I swear I gained 10 lbs that week!

I booked thru vacationstogo.com and they are superior. I highly recommend them. The resort was very beautiful and for many reasons I would say, 5 star. Only for a few reasons would I say 4, and with constructive criticism, I think they can easily become a 5 star. We thought the food was great; there was so much to choose from, the hours of operation fit our needs and we had no complaints. Well...ok, beware of the undercooked bacon but, beyond that, the amount of effort put into these buffets 3 times a day was truly amazing. With my 2 boys still in the sibling rivalry/teasing stage, the buffets simply worked perfectly for us. In general, the Mexican people are extremely friendly. I felt like a queen; they were always offering to help or assist with everything. The room was SUPER clean and beautiful, the maid service was superior. I'd read another review and decided, I, too, would tip 30 pesos or $3US dollars per day on the bed pillow. Each afternoon my kids were treated to a new animal or figure shaped out of towels on the bed. It sounds silly but it was not only a nice personal touch but a very creative and unique gesture that my kids loved. One complaint I have about the property management is the attitude of the front desk and lack of information provided at check-in. They are friendly, yet robotic, not really \"offering\" any helpful information for your stay. The property is enormous and overwhelming when you first arrive...we felt a bit ignorant wandering around trying to figure out how to get to our room. A map was handed to us but it was not detailed enough. We were given our keys and that's about it. I think if this were a US hotel, the desk clerk would have explained the buffets, their 3 locations, the theatre, game room, etc. Don't get me wrong, by day 2-3 we knew everything blind but we certainly stumbled to get to that point, which was frustrating in the heat. The pools were pretty and plenty and we loved the swim up bars. We wanted for nothing - the kids and I had drinks available constantly. Th nighty 9:30 theatre shows were great but beyond that there wasn't much else going on. The pools close at 8 and the beach is pitch black. More nightly entertainment would be a huge plus; miniature golf or even having one of the pools open til 10 or 11 would be a help. The big question...would I go back? Yes.

We'd exchanged our timeshare week in the UK through RCI. We had a suite which could have accommodated up to 6 persons (utilizing two sofa beds), so we found we had plenty of space (It might have been cramped for 6). The bathroom was large and well kitted out and there was a second sink area just outside the main bathroom. The unit was well equipped, with a very large comfortable bed, modern kitchenette and furniture, 2 TVs, a plunge pool (rather cool) and two loungers. The rooms were spotlessly clean, and indeed so was the whole complex. As others have said, it is a very large resort and we were in 'Grand Mayan Golf Edifice 10' which is about 15 minutes walk from the centre of the complex and 20+ minutes from the beach. Yes there are 'golf buggies' to transport you if you need them, but we really appreciated the regular walks ... they were no great burden, and gave us the opportunity to call in on the crocodiles and look out for iguanas and lizards en route. When we arrived, having hired a car at the airport, we were slightly concerned to find the reception area located in a marquee on the edge of the campus ... but we needn't have worried. The reception area at the centre is currently being rebuilt, along with other resource facilties, but this did not detract from our enjoyment at all. Checking in and out were straight forward and quick, except for my wife's credit card initially being refused! (Not the fault of the hotel) The hotel does not handle any cash (but will at check out), so everything is charged to your room .... food, internet, Spa, poolside refreshments, grocery store, laundry, etc., and a 15% service charge (tip) is automatically added to most service items. It is very convenient ... but it would be easy to let the expense get the better of you. Tip - it's worth stocking up with goods off-site rather than use the store if planning to do a lot of self-catering. The pools are extremely attractive and pleasant to use. There are plenty of loungers around and we never had trouble finding ones to use in a location we wanted. The beach is not the best we've encountered, and the resort will say they are currently in the process of building up the beach, having laid interestingly shaped round hollow blocks in the sea to enable the sand to build up. It seems to be successful. We found the restaurants to be good (a bit on the pricey side). The barbecues at del Lago over the weekend represented good value, particularly as there was usually some form of entertainment taking place at the same time. We had two excellent meals at the Italian Tramonto Restaurant ... but it's wise to book a table in advance, particularly on Mondays-Thursdays when del Lago is not open in the evenings. We had one excellent waiter who really made an effort to make us welcome and gave good advice about the menu, but sadly on another occasion, a waiter who was much less accommodating. As far as staffing goes, the later was the exception rather than the norm, as most staff were only too keen to make our stay as pleasant as possible. From the Grand Mayan we took trips to Chichen Itza (allow 2 and a half hours to get there ... easy driving, but start out early), Tulum (1 hour), Playa del Carmen (20 mins) and don't miss Xcaret (1hr). All are very well worthwhile.

We were three women and we had a great time. The Cancun airport is completely renovated since last year and it was very easy to navigate. The hotel picked us up no charge, as prearranged. They don't have all inclusive here as in most time shares, but since we each brought half a suitcase full of food items, it was less then $4OO. each for the week. We were able to establish seperate bills and we basically just paid for dinner and some drinks. The hotel was only at 25% capacity so there was no problem reserving a palapa or getting a chair in the shade on the beach or reservations for dinner. As others have said the beach is lovely, but after 2 feet into the water the coral and rock are sharp and irregular. We brought water shoes, but it was still hard to get in the water. We ended up sitting in plastic chairs where the water laps onto the sand. this worked well to cool off. The ocean was about 80 so you could sit there all day. The pool was about 90, not refreshing at all. I wore 50 sunscreen and mostly sat in the shade and got pretty brown. My friend got a bad burn. It was blazing hot since it was August and that's probably why it was so slow. There was service on the beach and we could order drinks, lunch and buckets of ice. The rooms were the best I've ever seen and I travel a lot. We had a two bedroom each with jacuzzi and sitting area. We shared a living room and fully functioning kitchen. The bathrooms were all marble and scrupulously clean. The kitchen had a toaster and blender and plenty of plates, glasses etc. the terrace had a small cool pool. As a free trade, this couldn't be beat. As long as you get in buildings 1-7 it's only a 5-10 minute walk to the pool/beach. After those buildings you would need a shuttle. Even though we had asked and they were pretty empty they had us set for building 13. We explained that I don't walk well and we were changed to building 5. The check in people weren't particulary nice. We were given our room number 3____, and assumed it was in building 3. We wandered around for a while before we realized the room numbers don't match the buildings. She could have told us this. We weren't harrassed to attend a time share once the time share people heard that we were traveling without our husbands. they approach you right after you check in. We never left the resort, figuring we would rather spend the taxi/rental car money within the resort. We found the prices very reasonable. Drinks At happy hour if you order a $3.50 beer, they bring you two of them,so we order a bunch and they were brought in a tub of ice, which they were glad to refresh as needed. Mixed drinks like Pina Colada were about $7.00, but again from 11-1 happy hour they would bring 2 for the price of 1. Food Lunch was usually about $8. for a sandwich to $10 for a burger and fries or ceviche. A medium pizza enough for 2 was $12. Del Lago has the breakfast buffet for $23 pp. from 7-noon. Really a brunch. We never went as we were happy with the toasted bagels we brought. Breakfast was also served as Havana Blue for about $7 an entree (omelette,hash browns,bacon,toast etc) The del Lago buffet has a different dinner theme each night. Sat. was oriental, Sunday was Italian and Thursday was Mexican and friday was steak and shrimp. We only ate there once as it was hot (no airconditioning) and buggy. We only at dinner once at Havana Blue. Although others on this internet said how good Havana blue was, I have to disagree. Between us we tried a numbern of entrees and appetizers. In general the fish was overcooked, also the place is hot and buggy. Again no airconditioning and it is open to outside. We ended up eating a few times at Tramonte. Why anyone would eat anywhere else is beyond my understanding. Tramonte is airconditioned. No bugs, with excellent service and ambience. it felt like a NY club. The food was excellent and cooked to order. They had many of the same items as room service and Havanna Blue but much more creative, more flexible in preperation, AND THE SAME PRICE! Appetizers were about $12 and they had shrimp and salad, or eggplant etc. Dinner ranged from $10 for a pasta dish to $15 for lasagnia or $25 for fish/shrimp. The best we had were about $19 for braised short ribs or veal ossobucco. the only disappointment was the sea bass. The fish was prepared with a grapefruit/olive topping which was ill conceived. I should have asked for it with a pesto topping or just plain. All the entrees come with free side dishes such as risotto, black spaghetti, carrot mashed potatoes, etc. If we were to come back, we would just eat here every night and go down the menu. We ordered a taxi the night before we left and it came to our buidling on schedule and charged us $30 for the return trip to the airport. We were able to check out and review our bill the night before or that morning right in our building. Indeed as others have said I had to have them credit us for the palapa or the charge would have remained. Everything else was correct as we had saved all our receipts.

I, along with my mother, my sister-in-law, my two daughters (17 & 18) and their friend, recently returned from a stay at The Grand Mayan 8/3 - 8/10. The weather was perfect....no rain and just a bit on the warm side. We rented a two-bedroom suite from an owner through EBay. Transaction was great and the resort treated us like owners. Just as everyone has already posted, this resort is huge. Because we travelled with a senior citizen who recently underwent heart surgery, we thankfully were put in Building 3. I honestly cannot imagine staying in any building greater than 7. Bldg 1 was the closest to the pools. The higher the building number, the further away it was. I walked from the temporary lobby one afternoon and it took me 25 minutes to get to the main pool. A tip: if you have to walk from a far away building, walk THROUGH the buildings on your way to the pool. The bottom floors are all open (no doors), and with the maids cleaning the rooms, the airconditioning spilled out into the walkways and kept it pretty cool. Even the 5-10 minute walk we had from 3, we still cut through building 1 & 2 to get relief from the sun. The decor and up keep of this property is amazing. Everything seems new even though it is the oldest of the Grupo properties (what we were told anyway). The beds are very firm and by the end of the week, my back was killing me. My neck also hurt from the hard pillows. I would seriously consider packing your own pillow if you are used to something soft!!! By the last few nights, I slept on the sofa bed which was a bit softer! We did not rent a car although we had planned to a couple of the days. After seeing how the locals drove, we decided against it. Since we didn't have a car, I felt very isolated in the Riviera Maya area. We took the shuttle to Playa, took a Collectivo to Cancun, and even caught a ride to Cancun from a guy in a van who stopped to pick us up on the highway. Even so, it is not the same as having your own wheels and going where you want and when you want. Taking the Collectivo to Cancun was a breeze, just take a shuttle to the main gate, walk a few feet to the highway and wait for it to come by. Be prepared to have the locals honk and flash their headlights at you! Be aware though that the Collectivo takes you DOWNTOWN and then you have to catch a bus to the Hotel Zone. This was an experience in itself trying to communicate with the non-english speaking bus driver. He eventually dropped us off at an information booth who told us to take bus R-1 to the Hotel Zone. I think the Collectivo ride to downtown was $2.50 and the bus to HZ was .60 USD. I would recommend this and save your money for the more expensive taxi ride home. One time a taxi charged us $100 to take 6 back and another time they charged us $45. THe more expensive one was at 1 am whereas the $45 ride was at about 4:30 pm. We enjoyed Play del Carmen and it cost $3.50 to take the hotel shuttle there. The shuttle drops you off at the Walmart or at 5th Avenue and then returns to get you. The only thing is, the latest shuttle leaving Play was 8 pm, so we ended up taking a taxi back. We loaded up on groceries and supplies at the Mega since some of the posts said the Walmart was awful. We didn't think so and preferred the Walmart since the shuttle takes you there and picks you up. The Mega is 3-4 blocks further, you have to walk from Walmart there and then we took a taxi home so we didn't have to lug everything back to our shuttle at Walmart. We had planned to go to Cozumel, but decided against it....again because we didn't know what we'd do once we got there....we'd have to taxi around...and with 6, it gets to be a pain. We did do the snorkeling tour offered at the GM which was the best value of our trip! $46 pp got you 2 hours of snorkeling and over an hour at a beautiful beach. A boat takes about 25 people out to a reef where you snorkel. You then move to another reef, snorkel, then head to the beach. It was well worth the money. My two teenagers and I parasailed, again with the GM people. I believe the price was $65 pp....not so sure it was worth it....maybe I'm just not a big parasailing person. The beach is awful because of the rocks and we never did anything there...other than parasailing and leaving on our snorkeling tour. I was very disappointed in this beacause 7 days at the pool was a little much. The pools are great, don't get me wrong. They are some of the nicest I've seen. They just get old after 7 days. Having a nice beach would have been a welcome option. Even walking on the rocks to get into the boat to go snorkeling was a huge challenge. I'm usually not a beach person, but seeing that beautiful, blue water and not being able to go into it was very disappointing. Another disappointment was not having Wi-Fi in the rooms. In order to access email or the web, you had to go to the Cyber Cafe and pay $7/hr to use one of their PCs or your own laptop. With even the lowliest of hotels offering free Wi-Fi these days, it was a huge disappointment to not be able to have access as I pleased. It was a pain to go to the cafe, and then I was always in a hurry as the minutes went by fast! I would recommend eating at least once at Tramonto. It was awesome! Stay away from the Havana Moon....the food was mediocre and the service was lousy....very slow considering we were in the place by ourselves. I guess that should have been a red flag right there. We didn't do any of the buffets. The pizza poolside was great as were the nachos, burgers and sandwiches. The drinks were good too...be sure to try a Picasso if you like sweet drinks. I preferred it without alcohol and it is a great option for kids! If you asked me if I enjoyed my stay at the GM, the answer is yes. Would I go there again, most definitely not. Having stayed here, I now know that I prefer staying at smaller resorts where the lobby is close by and I can get to the restaurants, pools and beaches quickly. If I went back to the Cancun area, I would definitely stay in the Cancun Hotel Zone or in Playa del Carmen where we could quickly hop on a bus to access shopping, eating, nightlife and have a variety of other things to do. I didn't like the isolated feeling I had staying in the Riviera Mayan area.", "Date": "August 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ny", "Title": "\u201cgreatest vacation at the grand mayan\u201d", "Author": "luvlylin", "ReviewID": "UR18947181", "Content": "My husband and I and our family consisting of teenage to young adults absolutely loved the Grand Mayan..The check-in procedure was a little annoying but that was partly our fault. They offered to take our luggage while we waited for our suite to be ready but we held onto several pieces and then had to carry them around. So definitely upon arrival let them take all your stuff. While waiting we had little maps and headed to the open air restaurant by the beach and all had lunch and Pina Colladas to celebrate our arrival. Even my youngest who was 18 could order drinks which made it more fun for her. The resort is very big but after 2 days you get to know it well and the walking is good for you because of all the fattening drinks you will probably be having. We occasionally took the shuttles and never had to wait more than a minute or two. There are many restaurants to choose from but our favorite was The Belche snack bar which was by the main pool and The Havana Moon which was right behind it facing the beach We found the wraps delicious and the food not that expensive. The pool bar was a definite high point for my kids and us as well. The staff was friendly and tried to help in any way. Rent a palapa one day if you will be hanging by the pool and feel like a million dollars. The units were immaculate and one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. We had a 2 bedroom which was spacious enough for all 6 of us. We could even have a little privacy if we wanted. I was so impressed with the quality of the Grand Mayan I am going to go to another Mayan resort next year. We did one excursion while we were there it was called The Coba Mayan experience. Even though I had researched it before going I decided not to book it until I got there. We went into town one day via the taxi provided by the resort(30 bucks round trip) The town was fun , pretty, but quite touristy. It is there that I booked the tour from one of the street concessions. It was a little cheaper than the big guys on the internet and more personalized. I definitely would recommend the tour we took. Since we booked this tour not from the resort they told us they were not allowed to come in there to pick us up and we would have to wait by the road. They were there right on time.with an air conditioned bus. Besides my party of 6 there was one other couple from Spain. We went to the Coba ruins and rented bikes there It was so much fun . The couple didnt want to ride bikes so they walked with the tour guide and we met up at stages along the way so he could explain things. At the end we reached the highest pyramid and were allowed to climb it to the top. This was why I chose coba over Chicenetza. After Coba we drove to a mayan village not open to the public. It was there we zip-lined over a lagoon. VERY FUN! Then kayaked a little , got to swim in a cenote and eat lunch provided by the mayan community. We didnt want to offend them so ate everything Only my daughter got sick at the end of the trip and we thought it was probably from there. Drink only the beer provided or the soda not the homemade juice. All in all we had a great trip .", "Date": "August 14, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Salem, NH", "Title": "\u201cExceptional Resort!! Fantastic Service at the Grand Mayan!!\u201d", "Author": "Nuth", "ReviewID": "UR18557280", "Content": "My wife had never been to Mexico (Cancun, etc) so we decided to go this year. We used a RCI exchange and found availability for a studio at The Grand Mayan, Apr. 19-26, 2008. I had never been to the Riviera Maya and wanted my wife's first visit to Mexico NOT be Cancun :) Using the fantastic Rivier Maya forum here on TripAdvisor, we were able to find a great shuttle service from the airport in Cancun to te Grand Mayan. On arrival we went into the tent. As mentioned in previous reviews, they had a fire in their previous Grand Mayan lobby (there is a seperate lobby for checkin to the Palace area of the resort). Side note: we did get to see where the new Grand Mayan lobby will be and it will be phenomenol!! They're also building a lazy river that is going to be spectacular. Since we had arrived early we had a long wait in the lobby for our room (2 hours) to be ready. The time went by fairly quickly (we went to have lunch at one of the restaurants on property). They also had bottled water and ice-cold wet towels to keep cool. Unfortunately, my charms didn't work on the room assignor and we ended up with a room in building 9. The higher the number, the further away you are from the pool and restaurant area. There are shuttles (golf carts) that run frequently and the walk in pleasant (check out the flamingos along the lake area). The room are incredible! Very nice marble floors, seperate shower and a jacuzzi. Their is also a separate water closet (toilet in small room). Great soaps, shampoos and also bath salts for the jacuzzi. The king size bed is comfortable and the room also has a flat-screen tv. Although we were on the second floor, we were rear-facing and we only had a view off our balcony of endless shrub and mangrove trees. The pool areas are beautful as well as the manicured gardens, walkways and landscapes. The Palace pool (open to all guests) is enormous with palapas/bed areas around the pool (these must be reserved) and plenty of chairs. The Grand Mayan pool (only for Grand Mayan guests) was a much quieter area off the main area and was next to the lake that sits in the middle of the property. This pool area is where my wife and I spent lots of time soaking in the sun (very strong rays..make sure to bring good sunblock) and swimming. This pool is also very large (not as big as the main one) but no worries about bumping into others. Nice bar area here with swings as seats :) There is also a neat gazebo with a few tables, plenty of chairs and lounge chairs. The food in all of the restaurants was excellent. We really enjoyed the breakfast buffets (my wife and I are big breakfast kind of folks). Lots of choices; omelets, eggs to order, pancakes, waffles, typical mexican comida (food), variety of juices, lots of fruit choices... a breakfast eaters paradise. We also attended one of the specialty nights (Mexican celebration) and the food was out of this world!! I got my picture taken with two of the cute chiquitas ;) much to the chagrin of my wife. Very much worth the money, great show with traditional songs, dance and evening show. A very good time!! The Grand Mayan has a nice deli with pastries and a small convenience store section. Of course, the prices for this \"convenience\" was high. Worth it if you want to grab a panini, croissant, etc. Not a \"daily dining\" kind of place (you'll go broke). They have a decent internet center as well as a nice on site spa and exercise facility. They also have a decent golf course on property (par 3 course). I could go on and on about this place... my wife really loved it. I think what was most impressive was the friendliness of all of the staff and the absolute customer-service centric attitude they all have. From the lobby to the roomservice, housekeeping, service staff. Even the guys keeping the grounds well manicured were friendly and always smiling. Really makes a difference when you are at a resort that it feels like the employees are happy and show it. The only thing that was kind of a downer, and completely our own fault, was the timeshare tour. Holy smokes. I'm in sales and this was the toughest, longest, most intense selling experience I have ever had at a resort. We were handed off to three seperate people every time we said no to the previous rep someone else would show up. Even when we were thanked for listening and turned over to the \"person who will survey you and your experience\" he tried to close us on a half week, return visit, every other year, trial stay, etc., etc. Unless you are a glutton for a punishing marathon session (heck whatever turns your screw) then give a polite \"no thank you\" to the invite to the timeshare tour. Otherwise, plan on losing 3+ hours of that day (although you do get a great free breakfast ;) and a $100 discount). The Grand Mayan has been our most favorite timeshare exchange and we fell in love with the place. Heck, during the grueling timeshare session for a split-second we even contemplated buying a week there (they have lockouts ;) ). The staff make this resort truly special. We're depressed they have a 1 in 5 policy :( Oh well... keeps us guessing until our return in 2013.", "Date": "August 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Milwaukee", "Title": "\u201cGreat time, loved it, loved it\u201d", "Author": "SNIPER710", "ReviewID": "UR18325546", "Content": "My family and I enjoyed every day on this lovely resort.

I could understand how some who stay in the farther buildings would not enjoy the walk, but the shuttles came by on time and very often.

We did not participate in the \"all inclusive\" program, as we ate in the cities and the two times we ate on the resort, I found the price was acceptable.

It can't be said enough that this is a huge resort (it is a Jungle). We stayed as guests through an exchange July 12-19, 2008 ARRIVAL - Shuttle service is available from the airport to the resort. We arrived at 11:00am and check in was not until 5pm. However we were able to check in early at 3pm. In the meantime we did go prepared with swimsuits and swam in pool until checkin we were even able to get a palapa (grass hut with bed underneath). Then went to Playa del Carmen using the bus $2 each person one way and loaded up on groceries at Wal-Mart. You will find everything you need there. We however took the cab coming back for $20. We are a family with 3 young children. DRAWBACK - although we arrived early and emailed request we were still not able to get a low numbered room. Palapas are $30 a day, however if you order food amounting to that much then charge is waivered. Make sure you check your bill to ensure the charge is removed. SHUTTLE - Athough I emailed (3x) requesting a low number room we litterally were in the last room next to the makeshift lobby, as the new Grand Mayan lobby has not been completed as of yet. It was a little combersome with a stroller getting on the shuttle, but it was doable. DRAWBACK - not all shuttles go where you want them to go, become familiar with flag colours which indicate where they are going. RESORT - What can I say it is beautiful and well maintained. There is the Mayan Palace and the Grand Mayan (newer)which is where we stayed. Staff is very friendly. Maid service was exceptional. Dipping pool on balcony which was very refreshing since pool water was very warm. Beach is very rocky so be very careful. If you want a beach go to Playa 20 min away. DRAWBACK - A pair of brand new white pants was mixed up in linen and it was not found RESTAURANTS - We ate at Balche (steak skirt is delicious), Havana Moon, and Del Lago(breakfast buffet is good). Prices were reasonable. DRAWBACK - 15% gratuity is added to all bills so be aware TOURS - We did Chichen Itza, which was a very interesting and informative tour. DRAWBACK - a long day with young children and most tours are 10 hours. I would recommend renting a car and driving yourself.

It's not worth your time, 10%, 100 dollars or a sneak peak of those twin peaks! They carry you & your bags all the way to your door. (Bring plenty of small bills for tipping for your stay). We were at building #3, lucky us, so I will not complain about the trips to the beach & pool. Golf course is emmaculate with 400 workers constantly grooming. Amazingly they disappear before every shot! No kidding! Excursions: Best bang for your buck? The jungle extreme adventure. Zip-Lining, biking & Cenote swim. 65$ per person. Includes transpo, the trip & authentic Mexican cooked lunch. The 2 guides are awesome (Victor & Julio from Vera-Cruz) They even stopped us off at the locals shack in Puerto Morelos so I could buy my wife her hammocks & my teenagers wrestling masks!!

Reserving one isn't really hard for anyone who can get up before 10 a.m Plenty of shade huts on the beach & yes the rocky beach will tear your skin to pieces and slippery enough to cut you a flip. Upon our arrival, I took a bus-van to Playa-del Carmen's Mega grocery store(15 pesos) $1.50 us. You have to go outside the main gate & cross the hwy where traffic is heading south. When you see the Playa sign in the front window, step towards the road & wave your arm to stop them. I spent $160 in drinks (2 cases & 2 fifths of tequila with mixes) and groceries that lasted a family of four a whole week. Of course you have to take a taxi back to the resort, but this was only 20 dollars. You'll see the taxis underneath the Mega on the bottom parking garage. We ate one time at Del-Largo (restaurant on resort), and that alone cost me $130. To save on drinks by the pool, buy a bucket of beer the first day, and covertly keep your bucket. Fill a small gym bag with your grocery store beer and stop by your buildings ice machine & fill-up on your way to the pool. We used our small bag w/wheels because of course it was heavy. Pre-mix your other drinks and carry them also. Keep it on the down low- Hello!!! Over-all, this trip was pretty cool. Hot & Humid & very family oriented.

Worked everytime! Would I go back? Probably not, due to the shear size of this place. Did I have a good time? Of course, I love to bargain 5-star resorts plus this is a great one-time vacation spot. Here's my bill run down for a family of four for a weeks stay. Believe it or not? Golf $74(1 time)-Dinner at del-largo $130- Extreme adventure excursion $130(2 people) - Groceries $160 -Bucket of beer $7.50- room service 2 breakfasts 56$ for a total of $558.50.

This was our first visit there and I was impressed. Definitely one of the nicest, if not the nicest, resort that we have stayed at. The resort is gorgeous and the customer service was nothing short of first rate. Everyone was very friendly. As for the resort itself, I don\u2019t remember seeing anything that was in disrepair or in need of cleaning. The maid came in our room to clean and change towels once a day and came back in the evening to turn down the beds. I will echo the earlier comments that the resort is quite large. We were placed in building 1 (after a bit of finagling) so we didn\u2019t experience the inter-resort transportation situation. There was lots of room at both the pools and the beach. With all the facilities there, I never got the feeling that the resort was \u201ctoo big\u201d and definitely it didn\u2019t feel crowded. For those that don\u2019t know, the Palace and the Mayan are just different sides of the \u201csame\u201d resort. The Mayan is the upgrade side. We stayed at the Mayan but toured the Palace. It seemed very nice also. All resort facilities are shared except a small private pool area for Mayan use only (actually a rather good sized pool area, small only in comparison with the main pool. It was as large or larger than pools at other resorts we have been to). Both pools are beautiful and well maintained. The restaurants seemed a little pricey but were about what I would expect to pay at a similar resort in the States. Room service was a good value and the kids liked the pizza. They also have a fairly well stocked store on-site with a bakery & deli. After reading other reviews, we decided to cancel our car reservation. This is the first vacation we have taken that we did not rent a car. That being said, we did not have a problem being without a car. The tours we went on picked us up at the resort. Cab fare was only $20 (each way) for the 4 of us to go to Playa. $30 to the Cancun airport. Playa seemed a nightmare to drive in. We didn\u2019t try the bus. The Playa area is more laid back than Cancun. We took 2 tours out of the Cancun area and they were geared more to singles/young adult partyers with all you can eat (good) and all you can drink (not so good). That being said, we did enjoy the pirate ship tour out of Cancun. The grilled lobster was delicious and the people didn\u2019t get as inebriated. Cell phone coverage was good at the resort (I have verizon). I had to set up my phone for international calling before I left the States. Calls back to the US were $1.50/min. A bit of advice, the timeshare sales pitch was the hardest sell job I have been to. However, to learn more about the resort and get money off our bill and reduced tour prices, we found it worth it.

Had a great time but could have been a lot better. First of all, all the reviews I have read on Trip Advisors about this resort were pretty much right on the button. 1. You really want a lower number building, I requested this several times before we even left for our vacation. They did have it on file, however, we ended up in building #11!!!! The location of the building was sooooo far away from the beach or the pool, that it put a damper on our whole vacation. They definitly need more shuttle service, a few times we ended up walking to the pool and beach area and were so tired and hot from the walk that it just made us more upset about the location of our room. 2. The pool was so warm that it was not even refreshing, I'm not kidding, it was that warm, like bath water. The ocean was a little cooler so we ended up swimming there more. It is true that it is very rocky there, you totally need to have water shoes on, but once you get past the rocks, it was fine. 3. The room was great we had the one bedroom with the kitchen and separate living room, very roomy and the maid service was great! The room service was really good too The skirt steak was awesome!! but I don't suggest getting the Pizza!! (ick) LOVED the pool on the balcony, used it every night as the weather was soooo hot! Everyone at the resort were very friendly and once we said \"NO\" to going to the timeshare pitch they never bothered us again. 4. The mexican fiesta night on Thursday was a lot of fun! and I'm glad we went to that. It was about $55 per person but included all the food and drink you want! 5. Go shopping for groceries first and load up on beer and food for the kitchen to save money because the prices are a little high at the resort. 6. We didn't spend a whole lot of time at the resort as we drove to see the ruins one day, went to Xel Ha which is a MUST if your a water lover and went to downtown Playa Del Carmen about three times. Go there at night time as it cools of just a little bit and shop on 5th avenue, great time there! Also ,drove about 15 minutes from the resort and found a beautiful sandy beach! Went to Azul restaurant that someone mentioned on Trip Advisors and it was a really cool experience as it is literally in a cave that winds around inside! (Thanks for the tip) All in all had a good time but not great, would rather stay at a resort closer to the beach and pool area and oh, don't forget the bug spray we got bit like crazy and went to the pharmacy twice for anti-itch cream!!

Inconvenienc - it was a nightmare. They offered me $100 of my room charge on my next visit. I put my wallet in the safe but didn't think about my camera. Lock everything if you go. What you can't fit in the safe bring keys for your luggage. It really is a beutiful resort and the staff are friendly. I just had a real bad vacation. I never thought it could happen in a five star gold crown resort so if you are thinking the same way, think again.", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "La Habra, Ca.", "Title": "\u201cGreat Time at the Grand Mayan\u201d", "Author": "rookiemom", "ReviewID": "UR17313784", "Content": "I went on a family trip with my parents, my baby boy of 17 months and my husband and stayed at the Grand Mayan, which is part of the Mayan Palace located in the Riviera Maya. We had a great time there. Like most people said it is a huge place, very spread out. If you are out of shape it might be hard to move around there without a shuttle. It is duable but when the weather is hot and humid it's really hard to walk around from your room to the pool area if your room is far away. They do have shuttle buses that come to pick you up. They seem to be pretty on time for the most part. If you are planning on staying at the Grand Mayan try requesting rooms in building 1-8. Buildings 10-13 are pretty far away and a good exercise to walk to the pool and restaurants. Let's see... the service was excellent. Staff members were very friendly and they tried their best to communicate with you in English. I know some people complained that they didn't speak enough English but come on now... this isn't the USA and they really try. Service rating I would give a 5 out of 5. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from. I tried the Belche Pool Restaurant and the Havanna Moon and I wasn't all that impressed. The food was okay. Room service prices are reasonable but they do take about 40 minutes to an hour to deliever. Overall I would give food rating a 3 out of 5. The pool area is really nice and if you stay in the Grand Mayan they have their own facility as well. Smaller compared to the Mayan Palace pool but very exclusive and cozy. The pool bar was fun to grab a drink and I really like the no money system. You can get to Playa del Carmen by bus across the street for about $2.50 or catch a cab for about $20.00 on way. The staff members are really good about giving you directions to different sights and catching a taxi from and to the hotel is not a problem at any time of the day. Just remember to ask how much the price is before getting in. I've notice this is how the fares went.... Xcaret one way was about 30.00, Puerto Morelos was about 15.00 one way and Playa del Carmen was about 20.00 one way. The beach at the resort is a bit choppy and not as calm so if you want to go hang out at the beach and swim in there go to Puerto Morelos (absolutely peaceful with less people) or Playa del Carmen (over crowded though). The only thing negative if I must point one this about this place is that you can hear your next door neighbor from the living room if they talk loud or if their alarm goes off. That was a bit annoying. The doors are connected by the living rooms I believe so if people are loud in the living room area you can hear noise. Overall, I had a great time at the Grand Mayan and would go there again to stay. It's a central location to Puerto Morelos, Playa del Carmen, going to Xcaret, Tulum, Xel-Ha, etc.", "Date": "June 28, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Slidell, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201chere are some tips if you plan to go\u201d", "Author": "lovebluewaterR", "ReviewID": "UR17273255", "Content": "OK here it goes, this is a great place if you don\u2019t go for crowds of drunken rude people and bunches of rowdy 20 somethingers.

As well as the friendly staff they have always made our stay as nice as can be. Yes it is isolated but if you want to you can always rent a car. I make my arrangements pre trip and on line and always get a great deal 7 days with insurance for about 250.00 or less. It is nice to have your own car so you can go on day trips to other beaches down the coast, Akumal, Paamul or Tulum or to restraunts in Playa or Puerto Moroles just up the road. Have never had any problems driving. Just remember the speed limit is the speed limit!!! Yellow lights mean stop (not hurry through) and don\u2019t drink and drive. (By the way the green traffic lights blink before they turn yellow giving you lots of time to stop.) If you are not brave enough to drive there is always the colectivos theses are small multipassenger vans that travel up and down the highway all day and most of the night till 10:00pm I think. The trip from Playa on one of these is less than $4.00 a person they let you off at the front entrance and you have to walk in.

However, our United flight did not have enough fuel to get to our connection, so we were delayed until late afternoon Monday. (won't go into the horrible details!!) We had an 18 year old friend of my son's that was flying in on Sunday on a different airline and was to meet us at customs since our flights were to arrive at the same time. He was at the Cancun ariport for 3 hours without a cell phone while I attempted to call anyone and everyone I could to have him directed to the Grand Mayan. I was finally able to contact him and have him shuttled to the Grand Mayan with the help of the Concierge. The resort allowed him to check in without us and I could not have resolved this without the incredible and wonderful Concierge staff. Do request via email the shuttle from the airport to the resort and print the copy of reservation and bring with you. Also, if delayed a day, as we were call them or email them to rearrange, or you won't be allowed on. I had kept up with all of the reviews online and was nervous about staying at this resort. I emailed the resort early to request buildings 1-7 thanks to the reviews. Unfortunately, we were in building 8. Since our guest had checked in, and no one else was checking in on Monday, we were at the front desk for a very short time to give them our credit card. We are 2 adults and 4 teenagers. The room was beautiful. We brought a DVD player and movies, thank you to the reviews. The walk to the pool was long, but never caught a shuttle. However, the weather was not hot this week and my husband and I are both very fit. The kids rarely walked and waited for the shuttle altough most of the time the shuttles were full, since they serviced buildings 10-13 first. The resort no longer has a shuttle into town, nor does the city bus stop in front of the resort. We counted on this transportation and were very disappointed to find it no longer existed. We searched for other transportation as 6 for a cab, 2 cabs, is expensive. We received many different/contradictary suggestions from staff. We ended up crossing the highway and catching the Playa Express for $2.50 each, although on one occasion is was $3.00. This is a mercedes van marked with Playa Express with Green and Yellow markings. You can see it coming down the road and sits higher than a regular van. Just flag it down, if it does not stop, it is full and wait for the next one. It will drop you off at 20th and 2nd, just a few blocks from 5th avenue and Walmart. You can also return to the drop off to take back to the Grand Mayan. There is also the Collectivo which will take you back to the resort and is located on fifth and ??, at a Taxi station road closer to Senior Frogs. Cost was $1.50 ea. The resort food was expensive and did not care for the automatic 15% tip, when service was not always that good. We did eat at the Havana Moon and was wonderful. We ordered the pizza many days and it was always good. The guacamole was terrific and a good buy as well. The grocery store was expensive, but if you take into consideration the cost of getting a cab back from Walmart and transportation issues, not a bad alternative. Could not find small bottles of water anywhere though and Walmart was not pleasant. We did rent a Palapa at $30 4 times, thanks to the reviews. And, ordered over $30 to credit back the cost of rental. However, we did have to go to the front dest to have it credited to our account as they do not credit it back automatically. One day however, after renting a Palapa at 8:00, we pulled up an additional lounge chair to our Palapa, went to the room to get our stuff and by the time we returned less than an hour later, the lounge had been placed back in its space by the pool and my shirts were gone. Never did find them, even after contacting security, complaining and filing a report. They were not sympathetic or helpful. Noticed there were always empty lounges by the pool, however this was a very rainy/stormy week to include thunder, lightning and water spouts, so a lot of people stayed away. We all loved the pool and Palapas. Could not get music by the pool however, which we like to have. If you take a cooler to the pool, security will confiscate it. We took our drinks in a bag that did not look like a cooler and we were fine. Loved the pool, but we needed to have a swimable beach. My only complaints for the staff was the many different answers you receive to the same questions and the conversation/flirting of staff with our 16 year old girls was inappropriate. I was nervous and did not feel safe leaving them unattended after dark at the resort because of what was said. I never found the staff to be unfriendly except for our shirt incident. Not sure why the resort can not provide you with written instruction on how to get to town. Although, my experience was they did not want you to leave the resort bacause they wanted you to spend your money on the resort. We did arrange transportation from the resort to Cancun, the Royal Sands for our 2nd week. After getting 4 different answers to our needs, we were satisfied with what was arranged and only paid $45.00 for all of us with our luggage. Happy to say we were in Cancun for a week after our stay at the Grand Mayan and would never stay at or close to Playa again, because it is too far away from everything and way too expensive. Our second week was so much more enjoyable and cheaper too!! In Cancun the city bus takes you everywhere you need to go for 65 pesos. If we had only stayed the one week, we would have been soooooo disappointed and let down because of staying at the Grand Mayan. One last tip, make sure if you are using American money, there are no markings on the bills as we were unable to use most of our money because of this.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Vacation at Grand Mayan\u201d", "Author": "atlbeachbum81", "ReviewID": "UR17217699", "Content": "I went with my boyfriend and family to the Grand Mayan the second week of June. We traded in my parents' time share for the Grand Mayan. The hotel was gorgeous and extremely well maintained. Check-in was easy for my boyfriend and I since we arrived at 5:30pm, which is when check-in begins, my parents however arrived around 11:30am and were extremely upset to learn that they had to wait until 5 until they could get into their room. The hotel has many gorgeously decorated restaurants and bars - even the outdoor furniture on the deck outside of Tramanto was decorated nicely. During the day the pools (which were gorgeous - and always warm and clean) would be packed, but at night time no matter where we would go everywhere would be empty. It is definitely worth waking up early to get a palapa by the pool - although i do not think it was necessary for us to get down there by 7am. I had read ahead of time that if you were not there by 7am, you would not get a palapa. The one day we went down and stood online we were second in line and there were only 5 people behind us, so many people who showed up closer to 9am were able to get palapas also - probably just not their first choice. Also - a hint - if you want to lay in quiet (not much noise or action around you) stay on the side of the pool closest to the sales center, the other side of the pool is where the crazy games and music is played. I thought the prices were extremely fair -drinks were cheaper than what i pay most of the time at home. My boyfriend and I had breakfast a few times at Havana Moon and thought that the prices were extremely reasonable and food was delicious (they had a delicious egg white omelette - for only $7!) The only food that seemed a little unreasonable was the dinner buffet at the Del Lago - the selection was quite minimal and a lot of the food quite bland, which tends to be the result when cooking mass quantity. The best restaurant by far was Tramanto, which although a little pricier than the other restaurants, was still not that expensive. We did attend the Mexican Fiesta since everyone told us that was the event not to be missed. It was a good show and we all enjoyed ourselves there, although we were not happy about giving up half of our day for it. The show begins at 7, but they make you arrive at 6pm. This was the only time we had a large selection of Mexican food. The rooms were immaculate. We had a two 1 bedroom suites. In the main room there was a small half kitchen (no oven - just microwave, refrigerator and stovetop - no dishwasher also - so if you do decide to cook you will have to wash your own dishes. we never cooked - had cereal one morning, but the last thing i want to do on vacation is spend it in my room cooking and cleaning), two couches and a kitchen table. In the bedroom not only did we have a king sized bed, but another couch to lounge on. One strange thing though was the bathtub in the bedroom -we figured it was a jacuzzi tub but were surprised to find out it was just a normal soaking tub in the bedroom. The bathroom was gorgeous, huge, and very modern. We also had a large patio with a dipping pool, which we only used once since it was the water was so cold. Both of our rooms were located in building 1, which definitely seemed to be the best location. We had an extremely short walk to the pools, beach and restaurants. The one day we took an excursion from a company not affiliated with the hotel we were dropped off at the front gate and had to walk back to the hotel, so we found out why so many people were complaining - if you are in buildings 10-13 then you will be no where near anything - except the front gate. But there are trollys, but we only used them two times so we never figured out when they began running, stopped running, where they went, etc. We did have a few complaints though. For one, the resort is very secluded from anywhere else. Although its pretty cheap to take a cab to Playa Del Carmen ($20 for 4 people), its a 25 minute ride and when the cab returned us to the hotel we found that they would only drop us off at the Mayan Palace Lobby which was a little distance from our room. Apparently there used to be a shuttle from the resort but they ended that service. The seclusion would not have been a problem if there was any action at the hotel. The daily activities were rarely announced, so unless you knew what time the activities you were interested in doing were being held at and where they would be, you would spend a lot of time looking for something to do. Also, at night all of the live music and shows ended at 10pm, which was very disapointing since we were on vacation and most of the time not eating dinner until late, so by the time we were finished, there would be nothing to do except go back to the room. Another problem that we had was we at the at the Habanero Grill one night (its a grilled buffet right on the beach) and were taking our time eating, which apparently you cannot do, we noticed they had stopped grilling and were beginning to put away the food even though it was not 10 yet (which is the time the restaurant closes), needless to say we had to rush to get whatever we could, which we were very disappointed to find out was not much at all. The beach is very rocky, but we were expecting that since last year we stayed at another resort in the Riviera Maya and found out that the resort had the same problem. We were also surprised to see how casual everything was at the resort. I'm used to going to resorts where the restaurants at night require the men where slacks and no shorts or tanktops or bathinguits. We felt extremely overdressed a lot of the time considering we had all brought clothes to follow those guidelines, but it seemed no one else did. Even at Tramando we saw men wearing shorts and muscle shirts, or women wearing beach cover-ups, so bring your casual clothes. The only other complaint we had was that there was not a very big selection of Mexican dishes at any of the restaurants - it was mostly American food, which unfortunately we did not go to Mexico for. Alli in all it was a very relaxing vacation, and we all enjoyed ourselves. I would only recommend this resort to families with children though since it looked like there were a ton of activities geared for children.", "Date": "June 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Littleton, Co", "Title": "\u201cFantastic Resort!\u201d", "Author": "ksagrillo", "ReviewID": "UR17057607", "Content": "We just got back from the Grand Mayan and I can honestly tell you that it was a fantastic experience.

I highly recommend reserving a cabana at the pool. The rental rate is $30 a day but it you order drinks and food then the cabana is FREE!! What a deal!

But you need to be prepared to walk a lot, deal with a beach that's virtually all rock (unwalkable in the water and difficult to navigate), food that's expensive and cold. I had to walk about a mile and a half to get an Internet signal. Again, I like to be connected. If that's not a big deal for you, you'll be fine. You're close to an hour from Cancun, and about 30 minutes from Playa del Carmen, a charming city with a nice tourist area to walk at night. The hotel says it provides shuttles to both cities (I even heard it pitched on a recording as I was waiting for the hotel operator to transfer me) but they don't. You have to take a cab for $40US or so to Playa and twice that to Cancun. I was the guest of a friend with a time share agreement, so didn't have to pay for the room. But I would have had a tough time putting $600US out a night for a room that isolated. The staff is friendly and nice (got tired of constantly saying \"hola\" and \"buenas dias\" to so many people) but they do try and help and make sure you're happy. The rooms are immaculate and well appointed. I was in Building 4 -- just about as far from the activity as you could get, so I got a lot of exercise walking to the pools, beach and restaurants. Lugging a computer to the only place for Internet added to the weight. One thing they don't tell you is that the lobby burned in February. So a lot of the services provided there on an efficient basis have been distributed across the huge property. You have to check in at a tent at the far end of the farthest building. Shuttles get you around, but it's a hassle. They do have plenty of activities, both for children and adults. If you get involved, you'll be fine. Some of them are pricey, but if you know your budget, you'll be okay. The Tramont restaurant is way overpriced with very small portions and a 35 minute wait for food. Wine is very overpriced at this facility. The Havana Moon restaurant food and prices are better, but you're right on the beach in an open building so you constantly have to swat flies from your food. You can't pay cash for anything. You sign for it. And for anything that involves a service, they automatically add 15%, even if the service was lousy. You can tip more if you want, but not less. They do have a small store where you can purchase supplies, but a box of crackers was $7.60US. A small round of average cheese was nearly $20. They have you by the rope. If you don't have a car you're stuck unless you want to put out for an expensive cab ride. They do have a nice workout facility with juice bar. And there's a bar and restaurant at both pools, but they close fairly early. We ended up taking our own food/beer to the beach one night and they didn't seem to mind.

Needless to say, I was not tempted to attend any timeshare presentations at the Grand Mayan. The hotel is definitely grand - its huge. However, it is so spread out, that it is difficult to get around. We seemingly spent as much time waiting for shuttle buses as we did at the pool or beach. And we didn't spend much time at the beach because the beach at the Grand Mayan is covered with reef and rocks, so you can't swim. At all. It was about a 15 minute walk to the pool area from our room, which is why we were always looking for the shuttle. People were constantly complaining about he lack of shuttles. No one could figure why they would not simply add a few additional shuttles so as to prevent this frustration. We found that at times we decided not to go to the pool because it was such a hassle to get there. As far as the pool goes, well, its huge. Very impressive. The only downside is that the pool is shallow, and thus it stays very warm. Some days the pool was so warm it was not refreshing at all. The concierges were helpful, and led us to some great restaurants and beaches in Playa del Carmen. The room we stayed in was nice, I must say.

The reviews are accurate that the resort is very large - with a golf course. The rooms are very nice - big bathrooms, new furniture, clean and comfortable. Only problem with the rooms is that they are connected by a (rather thin) door. So, we heard the family of 4 come home every night and got to lay through the little girl's evening tantrum prior to bedtime. We got used to it, but only because we thought it would be rude since it was her age, nothing more. BUT, if you are sensitive to noise, the buildings are echo chambers - no carpeting anywhere - so the baby across the hall will sound like it is crying in the hallway. The staff is very helpful and eager to get you what you need. Not sure I'd say its a great honeymoon spot b/c there are mostly families there - but it was a relaxing vacation for us. The restaurants, pool, beach, gym and spa are located next to the beach and the rooms are separated by a series of landscaped areas and walkways (meandering, at the least). The grounds are attractive and very well maintained. The spa is nice and the gym was mostly empty, but absolutely fit the bill. We went daily - there's a $50pp/wk charge if you plan to use it regularly - very wortih it, to us. That gets you full use of gym and spa facilities. Now, for the rest of the deal: 1) Property Layout/Shuttles: Barely anyone actually walks from the beach/pool/restaurants to their rooms because the paths are so windy that it does take a while. You can walk, but very few people do - even us, we're in shape and (fairly) young, but just didn't feel like hoofing it after a long day of being in the sun. The shuttles run you back and forth - which is not terrible, and we never had to wait more than 5 minutes. However, the resort was not that crowded. It may get slower when there are more people waiting. And, if you are with a big group/family, you may have to take a few shuttles. I'll tell you that we have been spoiled by oceanfront rooms for too long. The best view you can get is of the golf course. If you want to be right next to the amenities, pool, and beach, this place is not for you. 2) Food: The food was good - not great, but there is a lot of it. This place is like being on a cruise - the buffet theme changes nightly, with somewhat cheesy entertainment, but the folks are trying. There's Havanna Moon (mediocre food, great location on the beach), Frida's (at night) - we never at there - its open air and it got a bit buggy for us at night (it is the rainy season) but the menu looked really good, and Tramonto. Tramonto is located inside the gift shop/convenience store building and includes a wine bar and a separate bar area. The restaurant was very good (italian/steak) - we ate there three times. It is the most expensive place, and we thought the best and most consistent. Now, we say that, but we are two adults with no kids - the other restaurants really seem to provide options for both adults and kids on their menus, so that works for other folks. The bar at Tramonto was a great louge/bar atmosphere, but noone used it. There was noone there each time we went - but we sat and had drinks and played cards at the bar. The wine bar is very attractive as well, but, the wine selections were rather mediocre and expensive. I'm no wine expert, but if I know I pay $10 for a low-end pino grigio (in Pa with horrible state stores!) and it is on their menu for $13 (yes dollars, $130 pesos), I know its not great. The atmosphere, again, is very nice, they just need to get better wines. 3) Pool/Beach: The pool is huge and has a number of relatively quiet corners, if you'd like. Kids love it, and two swim up bars seem to be popular (one is more active than the other). We enjoyed the main pool primarily for people watching and rented a palapa for a few days. The Grand Mayan pool is 1/10 the size of the main pool and has an awkward \"beach\" area. It was kind of small and didn't have food service, so we usually used the other pool. It is, by far, the more quiet pool and that hit the spot some days. Beware of the activities guys - with a microphone - who puts on contests pool-side daily. He can be somewhat annoying (for some, I am sure) due to constant noise, but people enjoyed the entertainment and you can either go to the Grand Mayan pool or find a quieter corner of the main pool up-wind of the speakers. The beach is fairly cruddy - and I'm saying that as a beach lover. We've been to beaches all over the world and actually, had difficulty taking a nice picture of this beach. It IS rocky to the point that you cannot get in without water shoes. Even then, its not so fun. We brought snorkel gear and thought we were the 'experienced' ones who could find a way in but, nope. There were a few people toughing it out, but once they were in, it took many minutes of very careful stepping to get out. The day we wanted little to no sun, we grabbed a hut-thing on the beach and sat in the shade listening to the surf, which was nice. That's about all you can do. We even tried to walk along the beach, but you hit a barbed-wire fence property about 100 yds one way and rocks about 150 yds the other way. The beach was a disappointment, but we were able to relax just the same. 4) Construction: They are re-building the lobby - currently it is an a/c tent, which was absolutely comfortable and fine - you cannot hear construction noise. We think they are creating another pool for the Grand Mayan and possibly some other amenities to further separate the Grand Mayan from the Mayan Palace. (We stayed there for one night - I posted a review/comparison.) Probably a good move, but just know that there is construction, but in building 8 and above, at least, you can't hear it. We never heard anything. CONCLUSION: In all, we went to lay and order bar service, eat out and swim a bit. This was a relaxing trip - so the resort was comfortable and the service was good. We probably won't go back as there are many other resorts to go to and many that have better beaches and less people. The RCI folks never bothered us after we said we didn't want to get a sales pitch. The food was decent, but not phenomenal. We didn't think it was that expensive, but both commented that if we had a family of 4, it may be pricey. It appeared as though many families (including extended) enjoy the facilities and variety of family-friendly activities and restaurants. Romantic vacation, well, you make it what it is - but I would go to a smaller, quieter resort if it were my honeymoon.

For instance, their so called available amenities are no longer available. Expect to go off the resort for a good time They apparently offered shuttles to and from town before but not anymore. The resort is actually located between Playa de Carmen and Cancun. If you want to go to Playa you have to take either their $20 taxi or go out into the middle of the road and catch a $2 bus. In order to go to Cancun taxis will charge you between $35-50 or you can take about 2 buses down there ($3 for the first bus and $0.70 for the second). But beware should you have an agreement with a taxi in the middle of the road for $2 per person fare he may argue with you at the lobby. And the hotel staff will side with the taxi driver and not you. Taking a tour? Well beware that by booking through the hotel the travel agent there will not only charge you the listed price but he will also tag on a so called 'rent' fee. Yes you heard right. So expect an additional $10 tacked on at least. i do recommend taking the Chichen Itza tour (~$85)...take the one that does not include the breakfast...trust me we had all the other perks but no breakfast. How's your room? Nice at first sight right? Well they charge about $3 per bottle of water which is understandable since it's a hotel. Granted there's dishes and cups and a kitchen should you need anything else ...it's pretty hard to get. it took us a 6 days (we were only there a week by the way) to get the divider open on the balcony. There are two maids so expect to tip twice at the end of your stay. Oh and they charge you a room tax which they fail to tell you at the beginning. Enjoying the pool? Sorry drinks are not free they charge you per to your room. There are large beds by the pool but those cost $80 a day...yes $80 american. Ah the beach.... There's rocks everywhere so don't expect to swim in the ocean there...You'll have to travel to Playa, Cancun or Isla Mujeres for a nice beach Need food? There's a market on the resort that charges 2-3x normal prices (all charges go directly to your room). There are restaurants expect to pay $20-$65 a person for a meal. I actually traveled off the resort 6 out of 7 days which i usually never do. This was the worst place that I have ever been and I doubt that I will ever return to cancun because of it. Some of the staff will pretend that they do not know english well should you have a complaint. Oh if they charge you the wrong price...they will hunt you down and demand that you give them the money even if it is only $2...i was intercepted at my shuttle back to the airport..which costs $15", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montgomery, Minnesota", "Title": "\u201cJune 1-5, 2008\u201d", "Author": "Chrisjoyy", "ReviewID": "UR16758628", "Content": "First of all I need to let you know that I won this trip to the Grand Mayan from Momtalk.com and Sun Country Airlines. So the only thing I had to pay for was the food. My friend and I had a great time! Before I left I read all of the reviews of the resort (180+) so I felt very informed! Yes, like everyone says it is very huge. We stayed in building 3 which wasn't too far of a walk. But far enough that I was still getting lost a couple of days after we got there:) Finally I figured it all out when it was time to go home. The room was very nice! They had fresh fruit waiting for us when we arrived and there was yummy chocolates for us at night. We had a regular room without the kitchenette and the first day I called to see if they could bring up a fridge and they did! Free of charge, it was a bigger 3 foot fridge. So that was nice! The safe is located in the closet and that worked well to keep valuable in. I wanted to do the time share presentation and get $100 but because I was married and didn't have my husband with they wouldn't give me the $100. So if you want to do it and you don't have your spouse just tell them you are single/divorced. They will never know. Although it was probably a good thing that I didn't go because a couple that went said it was terrible! They were very rude and wouldn't let them leave for over 3 1/2 hours. We took the city bus to Playa. That was a tad bit scarey. First of all you have to cross the highway and stand in a bunch of garbage and wait until the bus drives by. It was just my friend and I and there were some questionable characters on the bus. We tried to sit as close to the bus driver as possible. If you take the bus it's only $2. (Taxi is $20) You will get off at the last stop when they pull into the bus station, this will be on 5th Ave. where all the shopping is. We took the bus one other time and it wasn't as bad. FYI - at the bus station you have to pay 30 cents to use the restoom. Just go to the McDonald's across the street for free. Also, another group that was staying at the Grand Mayan gave us a tip to turn your wrist band inside out so it's white. I guess the venders think people staying in the Grand Mayan are rich and they don't barter as much. I don't know for sure if it's true but we did it anyway! We booked a tour through a tour stand in Playa. It was cheaper this way ($55 to Chichen Itza instead of $85 at the Grand Mayan). But if you can afford it just go through the Grand Mayan. We had bad luck with this tour. They didn't pick us up the first day, (supposedly the driver was in the hospital). So they picked up us the next day and we spent 1 1/2 hours driving around picking up other people at their resorts and then another 2 1/2 hours to get there. And we were suppose to be on a luxery bus, but it was just a bigger van that was totally uncomfortable. Then when we got to Chichen Itza our tour guide did not speak good English at all so we didn't learn too much from him. We followed another guide around for a little bit who was much easier to understand. But I was happy that I visited it because it is one of the new \"seven wonders of the world\". We really liked eating at the Havana Moon. They have good food there and they had good Cuban Music playing. They say the water is ok to drink there. I usually got a glass of ice water instead of spending $3 on a can of pop. (As you can tell I'm kind of cheap:) They have free shows at the Del Lago every night at 8pm (except you have to pay on Thursdays). I thought the show was enjoyable. We saved all of our reciepts from the resturants, etc. and when we figured out our bill it was 100% correct. So that was not a problem. Yes, the beach is rocky but I don't really care to swim in the ocean. The pools were nice.

There were 7 of us that went (all 24 years old, some married, some single). Positives: The resort is amazing, the staff is wonderful, the rooms are very clean, the restaurants are all nice. The staff is great - you never even have to leave your lawn chair if you don't want, and all the food is great - we went to every restaurant at the resort - Tramonto is fancier - but great food, Del Lago is wonderful, but a little spendy for the buffets - definitely try the breakfast buffet, Havana Moon is cheaper, but fun atmosphere. Also, try room service - it is reasonably priced and very good. Negatives: It is hard to swim in the ocean right out in front of the resort, but we brought strap-on sandals and were able to do so. Do not take the shuttle into Playa Del Carmen - we did so and the taxi company blocked the shuttle bus in and wouldn't let us leave for 3 hours because apparently the taxi company and the shuttle company are at some sort of war to fight for customers. The Federal police ended up coming and put us in taxis back to the hotel. We requested to speak with a manager after the incident as we and our groceries sat on the bus for 3 hours, our friends worried why we weren't back, and we were scared and didn't know what to do. THe resort ended up giving each of us 2 free breakfast buffets - so a total value of $300 for our experience. Anyway, something to consider if you want to go into Playa (which is fun...and definitely worth it as groceries are so cheap there) is to just take a taxi round trip. 5th Avenue has plenty of shopping, awesome restaurants, and the beach is wonderful (pack your swimsuit). Tips: 1. Pack comfortable sandals for walking!!! I recommend \"Reef\" sandals. 2. Pack strappy sandals for swimming in the ocean. I recommend \"chacos or tevas\" 3. We learned near the end of the week that if you walk up the beach around someone's personal residence (we had to walk in the water as they put a cement wall into the ocean) to the next resort over - they have a sandy beach and it is sand all the way out in the ocean - it was definitely worth the walk (nice for swimming). They have lifeguard towers right in front of where everyone was swimming. It is kind of a long walk - but worth it if you want to swim and play in the waves. 4. The snorkel trip through the resort is fun. You sign up at the activity shack on the beach. They take pictures of you and your group and charge you for a cd. A cd cost us $30 (so don't pay more). 5. Order the drink that comes in a pinnapple at the pool - it is great!

Not one of us was disappointed with our stay. We were all in Building 1, which made it very convenient to all the amenities. I do have to admit that if you are in Buildings 8-13, it is a distance to the pools, restaurants, fitness center, spa, and beach; however, there are shuttles to get you around if you don't want to walk. During one of our morning walks, we encountered Flamingo Island and two crocodile enclosures, one at the 19th Hole and the other near Building 8. As in all other reviews, the beach is rocky, but we are \"pool people\" so that didn't bother us. It was unfortunate, though, that we had very windy weather which prevented our 20-year-olds from going out on the jet-skis, but volleyball games in the pool kept them occupied. We also took advantage of the daily pool bar Happy Hour (2 for 1) and the \"drink of the day.\" Most of our dinners were devoured at Havana Moon where we also danced up a storm to the music provided by our favorite Rock Band: Mobile. They're amazing! Another pleasant surprise was the new Habanera Grill, an \"on-the-beach\" dinner buffet and grill. The steak was out of this world, not to mention the chicken, ribs, burgers, hot dogs, and fish! The Breakfast Buffet in Del Lago didn't disappoint us either. Can you tell we all like to eat and drink? Our excursions consisted of Xel-Ha and Chichen Itza, both of which were fun and amazing, and both of which were reserved through the travel agency on-site at the Mayan Palace. It's so convenient to book everything through them. Another day, we took the shuttle into Playa del Carmen only to find out that although they dropped us off at the Mega Store, they were not coming back to pick us up! That was the only \"catastrophe\" of the entire trip. We found out that it was something \"political\" in nature; therefore, we had to resort to hiring 2 taxi vans to bring all of us back to The Grand Mayan. Truthfully, it was fun having 15 people there, but it was also a transportation issue, as you can imagine. As a side note, The Grand Mayan has not yet recovered from the fire they had in January. The new shops, pool, and Grand Mayan Lobby are all still under construction with, I believe, an estimated completion date of 6 months. It will be amazing once they do finally finish it. Well, this review is a lot longer than I thought it would be and I still haven't covered everything. Suffice it to say that we all absolutely LOVE The Grand Mayan.

Room: We had master suite, which was esentially two rooms combined. It was perfect for two couples and more. The maid service was impecable, the room was always spotless when we got back in the afternoon. Pool: The Mayan Palace pool is amazing! We spent every day there. The Grany Mayan pool is much smaller, but also looked very nice. As with most resorts, people get up early to put towels on the chairs to reserve them for when they actually show up. The shadier spots were always taken. I'm a sun worshiper, but by mid afternoon, shade was welcomed. The sun is incredibly potent on the Riviera. In some of the room literature, it says that the \"suggest\" that coolers are not brought to the pool or beach - no where does it say that coolers are prohibited. For that reason, I brought a small one to the pool every day stocked with water and a few snacks. No one said anything until the third day when one of the staff said that coolers were not allowed, and they needed to confiscate it. However, they had no problem with us keeping what was inside the cooler. They suggested we get buckets with ice from the bar. I was totally confused by this - it makes no sense. If you want to bring a cooler, just put it inside a regular beach bag, they'll never know the difference. Food: Since we had a kitchen in our room, we went to the Mega grocery store in Playa to pick up breakfast and lunch foods, and lots of water. We saved a lot of money by doing this. For dinner, we went to the Del Lago buffet twice, and it was very good both times. I thought $26 for a buffet was very reasonable. The food at the steakhouse was very good, but the service was terrible. A 15% tip is included in all bills, including bar and room service. I highly suggest not paying cash for anything. We reviewed our room bill every day, and several times, things we paid cash for were also on the room bill. Just put it all on your room to make life easier. Things to do: Playa del Carmen. 5th street was much cleaner and built up than I expected. However the people in front of the stores are pushy pushy pushy. I found that very annoying. Cancun was like being in Vegas or Miami, the hotels are enormous and it's all american restaurants etc. Tulum ruins, I highly recommend.

From the time we were met at the airport for the courtesy shuttle to the resort to when we departed via a shuttle arranged by the resort, the service was impeccable wherever we went in the resort. Check in was faultless, our room was ready when we arrived about 2 pm. The daily chamber maid service was always timely and efficient, the servers at the restaurants and around the pool were great, always smiling, always helpful. We especially liked the 'health restaurant' in the Brio Spa, a great place for light, healthy meals. Tramonto was also a great restaurant though we only ate there once. The Balche at pool side was fine for an casual, easy meal. All in all, the food and service were what you would expect from a resort of this caliber. We were in building 12 which we had requested in earlier emails with the Conciereg. Yes, the property is large, but walking from buildings 8-13 to the pool and restaurant area was only about 15 minutes or so through beautifully maintained grounds. The vegetation was in full bloom, the grounds were meticulously maintained. We're both in our mid to late 60's so enjoyed the exercise. When we wanted a shuttle, one was always available within 5 minutes or less. The time share folks of course wanted your attention so that's a personal choice as to whether to sit through a couple of hours to see what they have to offer. You do get some special benefits that can be used during your stay, so it may fit, may not to go through the presentation. We reserved a Palapa with bed and lounge chairs for one day, it was great by the pool. Be aware that you can reserve a Palapa a day in advance as well as for the current day.

I'm a pool person and thoroughly enjoyed the Grand Mayan pool. It was quiet and peaceful and allowed for much relaxation. The aquarobics and drink mixing classes were fun. We ate at all of the restaurants except Tramonto and the food was excellent. We even had room service a few times and the prices weren't any higher but again the food was great. We didn't stay at Del Lago for any of the shows, but could hear the music from our suite so sat outside at night to listen.

There isn't much in the way of English speaking TV (only a few stations), but we brought a portable DVD player (we asked before hand and they don't have them) and watched some movies. We decided not to rent a car and were glad because they drive like maniacs there. The resort has a shuttle that goes to Playa several times a day at a cost of $3 per person each way. We ended up taking a taxi which cost us $20 each. It was more expensive but dropped us right on Fifth Avenue and picked up us 3 hours later. Most of the staff speaks English except the cleaning and maintenance people. However, it was easy getting across what we needed. I got a lot of laughs saying my command of spanish is only the phrase \"donde esta el banyo\" which means \"where is the bathroom\". The staff also seems to appreciate that you make an effort to speak a little spanish so we picked up a few other phrases. All in all we had a great time and I definitely would go back again. My only personal negative comment is that the resort is too big for me, I prefer smaller more compact resorts. Make sure you email the concierge before hand and ask for building 1 through 7.

We had the 2 bedroom, 2 bath Grand Master Villa with plunge pool on the terrace and were lucky enough to be in Bldg. 6 In my opinion Bldg. 7 and 6 are the best locations. The walk to the pool and restaurants was not to far and the grounds are beautiful, lush and tropical. We actually enjoyed our walks through the grounds and it helped us not gaining to much weight. However, if you are in Bldg 8 or higher pools and restaurants are far and the shuttle will be important. Our villa consisted of 2504 & 2506 and was perfect for 2 couples. Everything was very clean, beautiful and we liked the decor. 2 couples have a lot of privacy. The Restaurants onsite are not inexpensive but they are very beautiful and the food is good. We really liked Havana Moon for Breakfast and Dinners and the Del Lago Buffet was nice. The Mayan Show was great! Tramonto is really nice and the Bar there is very stylish. Great interior design all around the resort even in the big white lobby tent. Service was very good and friendly during our stay. Room service was perfect and the turn down service was a nice touch. We really have nothing negative to say about the Grand Mayan. Only one thing the bed matress is very hard. The pools are amazing. Large and beautiful. The Grand Mayan pool is really nice as well overlooking the lagoon. The beach is pretty with white soft sand and lots of Palm trees, shade Palapas and hamocks. The ocean looks beautiful but swimming is not an easy task here with rocks and coral to walk across. But the wonderful pools make up for that. One day we rented a Cabana Bed by the pool and it was cozy with very good service all day. We did the Maroma Reef Snorkeling with the onsite Dive Shop and it was awesome. We snorkeled on this Reef for the 4th time but this time we encountered a large Marlin that swam around us for almost 10 minutes. He was interested in us and came very close. Amazing! After snorkeling 2 good spots on the reef they took us to a very pretty part of Playa Maroma for 45 minutes. It was very remote and pristine. The Deli is very well stocked even with many nice gourmet items but double the price as stores in Playa or Tulum. However, it was nice to have it for a few things. The Internet Cafe is nice as well. We had a rental car which was great to get around but they also offered inexpensive shuttle service into Playa every day. They just changed this and you don't have to make reservations for the shuttle anymore. You just pay at the shuttle. Our friend used the gym and spa every day and told us that it was super nice with great equipment. We all thought this was a very nice condo resort and had a very enjoyable vacation there. We were not sure if we would like the Grand Mayan because it is so big but it was better than expected. I can see why families love this resort and it is also very nice for child free adults like us!", "Date": "May 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vermont", "Title": "\u201cdon't believe the bad reviews\u201d", "Author": "bridportmama", "ReviewID": "UR15671610", "Content": "We booked through RCI, a timeshare trading/exchange firm. We stayed a week, had the big suite, and another couple joined us a couple days into the trip. After reading a gazillion reviews, I was scared to go almost, but was pleasantly surprised. The whole week, the four of us kept saying to one another, \"what are people complaining about?\" By the way, was 7 months pregnant and we often walked, (we were in building 9). Nothing ever took more than 10 min., and that is a maximum. Mind you, I'm 7 months pregnant and walk at a snails pace. We enjoyed the walking, especially after dinner! Tramonto's Prime Rib night special was AMAZING; $36 for salad or soup, prime rib, and dessert--we had grand maranier souffl\u00e9, all said it was the best dessert they'd EVER had! Skip the buffet, skip the shows--not worth it. Go to NYC or Vegas if you want to see a show, unless you like cheesy costumes and 80s music... I loved the Grand Mayan pool, it was so much nicer, awesome view of the lagoon, much quieter and definitely more relaxing and luxurious. Of course, I wasn't doing much drinking, so maybe if you are a big drinker you might prefer the crowds and swim up bars, but no thank you for me. The beach was rocky, but the pier was gorgeous. I'm more of a beach-admirer, than swimmer, so it was no sweat of my back, to cool off in a big pool instead. We also enjoyed eating at Havana Moon (great views) and room service was awesome, as others have said. We got pizza twice! We definitely under-utilized the kitchen though....Next time, we will hit the mega and stock up on groceries to cut costs. Anyway, we had a wonderful time, the staff was incredible, the resort was beautiful, and the walking was a pleasure, don't believe the nay-sayers. If you go to a resort expecting to be treated like royalty, then sure, perhaps you might have something to complain about. It's great resort, we plan to take the kids back with us next time in 2 or 3 years.

Where should I begin...Check In: Since the main lobby for the GMR was burnt down a few months ago they have set up a temp Lobby by bldg 12-13. It is a very large tent with air conditioning. Check in was quick. They offered cold bottles of water at check in. Shuttles: Yes this place is very large. the grounds are kept in perfect condition. At times the shuttles were a bit of a pain, but we dealt with it and actually got the hang of it towards the end of the week. We were on vacation, we were in no rush to get anywhere. Rooms: We were put in bldg 8-9 along with our friends. There were 13 of us all together. 6 adults and 7 kids. 3 of which were 2-2 1/2 year olds. The 3 families each had a 2 bedroom accommodations. We requested 2 cribs for our twins. The cribs were larger than most and made of very good quality. Its not the pack and plays that you may get at other resorts. The rooms were wonderful. Clean and excellently decorated. The kitchen had a stove top, microwave and a half size fridge. They also had all the necessary pots, pans, utensils and silverware to cook and eat in the room. This is an obvious convenience if you have young children with you. We all decided to attend the timeshare presentation. We were not pressured but they offered $85 and 10% off the entire bill. So it was worth it. It did take 3-4 hrs though. The pool is great. Try to rent the cabanas. Th rental cost is $30, but if you order $30 or more of food/beverage via wait service or the restaurants then they will refund the $30 cabana cost. You can only reserve the cabanas a day ahead, just try to get there early to do so. The cabanas have beds underneath them. Our kids had their naps on it and they loved it. didn't have to shuttle back and forth to the room for their naps. There was a cool breeze coming from the ocean so it felt very comfortable, but this is deceiving because the sun is very strong. Alot of sunscreen is definitely needed. The set up at the beach is great, they have a sunshade for the beach goers. The beach is very rocky, but i saw a lot of people further out swimming in the water. The water is a clear blue. We took a look at the exclusive Grand Mayan pool and preferred the larger pool. There were many activities for the adults and kids around the pool. All of our older kids were asked to play soccer on the beach. Food: I found the prices to be reasonable, considering I'm from NY. There is a market/Deli where you can purchase frozen food, beverages and basic saundries. I purchased a Paninni sandwhich and the fruit salad from the Deli. It was very tasty. We ate at the Del Largo restaurant for the dinner show buffet. the food was average but the show was nice. The Havana Moon was a bit better. My kids found the chicken nuggets there to be very good. I thought the Nachos was very good. Burgers and chicken fingers and items like that by the pool were very good also. The best it the Tramanto Restaurant. It is located in the Deli and Boutique building overlooking the pool. It is a beautiful place with a great lounge and bar. The prices are comprable to the other restaurants on the resort. I would've made reservations to this restaurant every day if I knew about it earlier. The Shrimp appetizer was excellent. The Tramanto also has a kids menu that is perfect for the kids, pasta and steak. Overall I felt the food at the resort was average to above average, but the service was impecccable. their wait staff was very accommadating and friendly. Especially poolside, \"Victor\" ran into the Deli to see if he could buy a Churro for my son. \"Maria\" came by and added extra Ice to our drinks without us asking. Thank you. Room service: Good food and reasonable prices. The Pizza was actually better than what i would expect in Mexico. We also found the salads to be very good. Hint: Unlike alot of timeshares this resort does not have washer or dryers in the units. But there is a laundry service available in every building. It cost $8 for a wash and dry of clothes. You can either do it yourself or have the attendant do it for you for $3. She did 3 loads of laundry and it cost $27. Wash, dried, folded and delivered to our room. A bit costly but worth it. We spent and afternoon evening in Playa Del Carmen. We rented a van to take us and pick us up. total cost for 6 adults, 4 kids and 3 toddlers $86. So it came out to $6.60 per person with tip. Just go see your concierge in the lobby of your building and they will set you up. We also spent a day at Xcaret, which is a theme park. It was OK. Just to get through the admission at the \"Family Plus\" center, the lockers and the snorkeling equipment took a very long time. Don't know if since we had alot if kids with us that it took a longer time, but by the time we were all done it took 2 hrs. Pack light if you decide to go. Did the Sea Trek there it was nice. They have a beach lagoon. Very nice, can order drinks and hang by the beach. The Lunch buffet was very good and a variety of selections. Try the grilled skirt steak. There is a WalMart in PlayaDel Carmen and there is a Costco nearby. We were going to purchase items for the week but for one reason or another we didn't. which was fine, the Deli Market had ample supplies. The only thing I would suggest is to stock up on the drinks if you go to walmart or costco.

We read all of the reviews beforehand, so knew what to expect more or less. Yes, the resort is HUGE. We were in building 6 which is one of the closest buildings to the pool and beach, as well as the restaurants. Still, it was alot of walking. I cannot imagine being in one of the farther buildings! Let me start by saying that the accomodations were amazing. We had a huge 2 BR unit with kitchen, and a private wading pool on the patio. There was a huge garden tub in one bedroom and a jacuzzi in the other bedroom. It was decorated very contemporary and tasteful. We couldnt say anything negative about the unit. The housekeeping service was great, also. However, the beach ........... Nothing is going to prepare you for how rocky and unswimable the beach is. We brought water shoes and were able to finagle our way through all of the sharp and slippery rocks. Once over the rocks, we were able to swim a few times. Finally, by the end of the week, we had bought a snorkel and mask and snorkeled at the resort beach. We wish we had discovered this sooner! The snorkeling right there at the resort is amazing. Because of all of the rocks and reefs in the water, there is significant marine life. We had so much fun swimming once we discovered snorkeling there. So, if you want to use this beach, definitely invest in a mask and snorkel. And Water Shoes!! The service is amazing. The staff is constantly waiting on you, making sure you have everything you need, even on the beach. Happy hour from 11-1:00 everyday is the best. Two drinks for the price of one is a huge savings at the end of the week. The buffets at the restaurants are awful in our opinion. Overpriced and not very good food. We got sucked in a few times, and regretted it. However, room service is amazing. The pizza was great, and the soup was good. The burgers were good. All in all, the best food we had at the resort was room service. Also, the Belche snack bar had really good food, too. Besides those two places, dont waste your money. The best day we had was taking the ferry over to Cozumel. We rented a few scooters, and saw Cozumel on our own. We ate at a little outdoor restaurant called coconuts, where my boyfriend says the beef nachos were really good. The views were amazing in Cozumel, as well as the most beautiful beaches you can imagine!! We also went into Cancun one night and ate at Bubba Gumps Shrimp on the water. The food was great!! We really enjoyed that alot. All in all, it was a nice time. Last year we went to Ocho Rios in Jamaica to an all inclusive resort. We prefer Jamaica and the culture there, as well as the beaches. But live and learn. Oh, and if you want to jetski, dont try jetskiing on the beach at the Grand Mayan. The water is so choppy and rough. You feel like you have been hit by a train by the time you are done. You will be sore for days.

We didn't have to go through any sales pitches as our friends were already owners. But we weren't pressured for any sales pitches, either, which was nice. As others on TA may have already said, arriving at the GM is a little weird as they apparently had a fire in their main lobby, so you check inside of a giant inflated tent. But otherwise, the staff was very friendly. As I suspect you do at other time share resorts, they have a no cash policy, which means you sign for everything and a 15 per cent gratuity is built-into most bills. We signed our names to get on their system, but it never worked right, but since we were there only four days, it wasn't too much of a problem. If you were there longer, make sure they get your signature right. The room we had was very nice. It was techinically a suite, I guess, and we shared the living area & kitchen with our friends who had the adjoining room. There was small pool on the deck, but it was cool water, but it was still a pleasant touch. The rooms were quiet and kept clean. They even did turn-down service, though oddly one night they came at about 9:30pm! We really loved the pools, as I'm sure others have written about. Staying at the Grand Mayan you can also use the Mayan Palace pool. The GM is the newer property compared to the older MP property. The MP pool is huge, with mulitple areas and two swim up bars, etc. There is also a pool just for GM guests that is smaller but not so busy. We went to one pool or another every day. We didn't use any of the resorts tour services, though we did use their affordable ($6 per person) shuttle to Playa Del Carmen. They also helped us take a taxi to Playa another time and get on a shuttle to Tulum for our own little tour. Overall, the property could seem a little sterile, almost \"compound\" like. But some people probably like that as opposed to an overly commercialized property or an all-inclusive where you feel obligated to stay there all the time.

We did a trade through RCI and had a Grand Master Suite. If you want to be close to the pools, beach and restaurants you need to call ahead and request to be in buildings 1, 2, 3 or 4. These are all within a short walk of everything. Although this resort is very large, there are things that you can do, while there and ahead of time, to make your stay very enjoyable. Getting there: We booked our transportation through the concierge desk from the airport to the hotel and everything went off without incident, very smooth. Check in: We arrived around 5:15 and were checked in and in our room by 6:00, drinking beers with dinner on the beach at the Habenero Grill by 6:30. You will be approached by the Time Share Sales folks in the lobby however, if you are not interested in the pitch, simply say no thank you and you will not hear another word from them, your entire stay. Restaurants: All of them are very nice and the food is great. I highly recommend the Mexican Fiesta night, which is on Thursday's, for $60.00/person the show and dinner are well worth it. All in all the prices are not much more than a mid-priced restaurant in the states with entrees ranging from $12 - $25. Beach: Yes it is rocky, however, if you are looking for a swimming beach, you can walk 5 mins. south of the resort and you are on a swimmable beach that no one else uses, at least no one was using it while I was there. If you want to get in the water at the resort, you can, however you do need some form of footwear, either aqua socks or I used my Keens, which were perfect for the rocky bottom. As for shade on the beach. There is no problem find shade between the palaps and the palm trees. Pools: There are two pools, one for that is only for Grand Mayan guests and the larger pool that is available for both Grand Mayan and Mayan Palace guests. Now, this will go against most of what is said as it relates to shade. In the entire 7 days that we were there, we had no trouble finding shade at the Mayan Palace pool. There was always a set of chairs under a palapa that were not being used. You may have to look for them, but they are generally available. Also, I would highly recommend that if you want to feel like a king and/or queen for a day or two, you book one of the palapa beds at the pool. They are $30.00/day to rent, however, if you purchases, at least, $30.00 in food and drinks, which isn't hard to do, the fee is waived. You can book them the same day, booking starts at 7:15 every morning and you do have to be down to the pool by 11:00 or they can give it to someone else. Oh, one more thing, you can book the palapa's one day in advance as well. In addition to the resort there are a ton of things to do while on the Mayan Riviera. I highly recommend that you book the shuttle into Playa Del Carmen. Playa has to be one of the nicest towns I have been in, anywhere. Quinta or 5th avenue, is awesome with great shops and restaurants and the beach is great. One restaurant you can't miss is Hemingway's the food is great and reasonably priced. It's right on 5th Ave and well worth a stop. If you are looking to stock your refrigerator back at the resort with beer, water and snacks, go to Mega, which is where the shuttle drops you off. We are from the Pacific NW and Mega is as nice as any Fred Meyer I have been in and everything is clearly listed in both Spanish and English. To get down to 5th Ave. turn left when you get off the shuttle and you will be in the heart of everything after about a 5 min. walk. Another outing that I highly recommend is to go into Puerto Moraloes. This is a sleepy little fishing town that is a 20 minute cab ride from the resort. The cost of the cab is about $15 U.S. but it is well worth it. Eat lunch at Pelicanos, right on the beach and they have some of the freshest shrimp cocktails I have ever had. The town is very small so it won't take long to walk through. However, a stroll down the beach is very nice and you can see the local fisherman bringing in their catch while the Pelican's and other birds try and pick up some scraps. We did do two excursions that we booked at the resort's travel desk. Tulum is a must, only a half day and at the end of the tour of the ruins, you get to swim in the ocean on one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever been on. The other half day excursion that was great was zip lining through the Jungle. We also booked this through the travel desk and had a blast. 11 zip lines, swim in a Cenote and then have lunch before you head back, cost was $65.00/person. All in all, we had a great time and would definitely go back. However, due to wanting to experience other places, next time we go to Mexico, we will head south to Playa Del Carmen. One last thing that I highly recommend. Please learn some Spanish. The service staff at the resort, maids, maintenance workers, etc..don't speak English. Remember, you are in their country so you should take the time to learn some phrases that will get you by. Not to mention, they love it that you even try.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "denver", "Title": "\u201cFun with the kids\u201d", "Author": "buffalosoldier2", "ReviewID": "UR15092509", "Content": "We spent one week at the Grand Mayan (Feb 9 to 16). Our group consisted of my wife and I and our 2 sons (ages 4 and 5). I exhaustively read the reviews here before booking our trip (a timeshare exchange through RCI) and am finally getting around to returning the favor. As I scoured many reviews looking for info that would help me determine if we'd be happy here with the kids I'll try to provide some helpful info in that area. Summary: Yes, this place is really huge. Yes, in general I think you'd be happier in a low # building (7 or lower) than the more distant buildings 8 to 12...but unless you're physically challenged or just a bitter person you ought to be happy anywhere in this place. We were in building 11 and had a great time. We walked about half the time...took the shuttle the other half (we didn't wait, just took it if was there or passed us on the way and walked if it didn't). Our boys liked to walk past the crocodiles and flamingos anyway. Yes, the ocean is useless here, hard to understand exactly why from reading the reviews, but trust me, you won't be going in the water (and neither will your kids). You can, however, enjoy the sand and the kids can build sandcastles at waters edge...and that covers about 90% of what we do at the beach as a family anyway. You can walk about 20 minutes up or down the beach and find a beach with accessible ocean. We did this once (going left as you face the ocean...but were told it was the same the other way too) and didn't feel the need to do it again. Or, go to Playa for a beautiful beach. The swimming pools are so awesome, this barely bothered us at all. The place is IMMACULATE, the service is far above par and the food/drinks were good to very good and reasonable priced for a resort. If it had a swimming beach and weren't quite so big, I'd have given it a 5 star rating...as it is, those things make it 4 star. Accommodations: We had one of the 2 bedroom suites (Grand Master?) and if there is one area I felt the reviews under-complimented it was the room. The room was absolutely awesome. Huge. Clean. Modern. 2 master suites with 5 piece baths...and huge. It was so nice to be able to get away from the kids (was that my outside voice?) in the suite, put them in their room with a movie and sit on the patio or take a jacuzzi bath or whatever. Nice, nice, nice. Huge couches that I could actually lay/sleep on (I'm 6'4\") or the boys could lay foot to foot and fall asleep while watching a movie. Great balcony. Never used the dipping pool...but it looked cool sitting there. Beds were firm and wonderful. Plenty useful kitchen (I've seen reviews lamenting the lack of mixing bowls and whatnot...who is plannig to bake a cake in mexico anyway? Everything you need to prepare and eat basic food is there). If you don't want to clean the dishes, leave them! I think the maid charges $10/day to clean your dishes...fair price if you just don't want to deal with it on vacation but do want to make eggs and toast for breakfast so you don't have to hassle with getting the kids out of the place and to the restaurant for breakfast. The half size refrigerator is plenty big for some milk, soda, beer, fruit, leftover pizza, and whatever other grub you might want. Flat Screen TV's were great. We brought a portable DVD player and though we felt like that was kind of weak to do so when we left the states it proved to be an absolute lifesaver. When we came back for naps in the afternoons after a day at the pool we just threw in a DVD and the kids were asleep in 5 minutes. That hour or two in the afternoon makes or breaks the vacation for the parents. Bring a DVD player and your 20 favorite DVD's and don't feel guilty about it. TV is not great...and I can't stand another minute of 'Spongebob Squarepants' in english...I feared I might shoot myself if I had to watch it in espanol. Maid service was excellent. We put out the 'please clean room' (or whatever) sign when we left in the mornings and left $5 for the maid each day and the place was spotless and perfect everyday when we got back. Common areas: For us, this pretty much meant the pool and poolside restaurant (Balche). We never used the Grand Mayan private pool...just walked past it on our way to the much larger/cooler Main pool (shared with the mayan palace). It's the coolest pool I've ever seen. It's huge and has swim up bars and palapas and coconut trees and all the things I needed for my soul when I left the snow and headed to mexico in February. We spent 4 entire days at the pool and it was awesome. The food and drinks seemed very reasonably priced for poolside service ($3ish for beer, $9 for a burger, etc) and the food was generally really good. I would especially recommend the guacamole...for about $5 it's a heaping monster sized pile of excellent guac. We ate it every single day (at the pool or in the room). 2 for 1 drink of the day always made me happy. There is a kids club of some nature...a couple of 'centers' for the kids to play in at the pool. Can't say that I ever saw any of the parents putting their kids in kids club though...the pool seemed to be kids club. Room service was excellent and quick and generally reasonable. THe pizza is worthwhile, the mixed mexican dinner sampler plate (can't remember the exact name but you'll recognize it on the room service menu) is more than worth the price and fed the whole family dinner one night. The food at Balche was good, the poolside food comes from there and we ate dinner there 2 nights...always got a seat right away. Casual but nice, good food, reasonable prices. Definitely OK with the kids and for the kids. Couldn't stand the wait for havana moon (it was always at least 45 minutes for dinner...an absolute killer with kids), didn't want to do the fancy place (tramonto) and aren't big on buffets. We used the on site deli/grocery for some pastries, bottled water, etc. Handy but expensive (as expected). Otherwise, we didn't use the rest of the facilites at all (golf, spa, etc) General Area and getting around: We rented a car (online ahead of time...was only like $160 at booking time but the insurance, as mentioned in these reviews, adds about $25/day) and if you've got kids, I can't imagine any other way. No way in hades I'm loading the family up and going out to the main road (almost a highway) to wait roadside for a bus to go anywhere. We had some sort of Nissan sentra knock-off car. It was fine, clean, reasonably new and the A/C blew cold. THere is only one road that goes up and down the peninsula on this side...so you can't possible get lost. North takes you to cancun, south to Playa...and that's it. Driving is easy...don't worry about it. People who've commented that the drivers are crazy and the driving is hard must be old or incompetent...or both. We used the car every day but one to either go to cancun, playa or on daytrips. With the kids, being able to leave when they get tired is paramount to having fun...taking a group tour bus means waiting to leave when the schedule says...and that can be a problem if your 4 year old is ready to sleep. We went to Chichen-Itza, which was awesome for my wife and I but boring for the kids (they toughed it out pretty well). If I can make one recommendation to those with kids, go to Xel Ha at least one day...maybe 2. It's amazing...basically a huge (several thousand acres) natural eco water park. I think it cost something like $200 for the whole family for the day and that was the 'all inclusive' price...which meant you could eat/drink at any of the restaurants and bars on the property (there are plenty) any time you wanted. In my world, nothing quite like 45 minutes on the lazy river inner tube, followed by an umbrella drink, followed by snorkeling, followed by an umbrella drink, followed by a 20 minute snooze in an honest to god hammock between 2 palm trees. Heaven. We were there from about 10am to 5pm and had an absolute blast. Lazy river tubing (natural river, not man made), jumping off rock cliffs, snorkeling, swim with dolphins, etc. etc. Very cool and very worth it. There is another similar place called Xcaret and I talked with a few other familes at the Mayan pool who had gone there and reported loving it similarly. Playa is a cool little town. The 5th avenue shopping/restaurant street is worth a visit or two for dinner and trinket buying. When you want to grocery shop, definitely Mega vs. WalMart. We did WalMart 1st because it's WalMart right? Yikes, WalMart is a dump. Mega is like an american grocery store. Don't be afraid, do Mega. Pharmacias: If your kids (or you) get sick, go to any pharmacia. They dispense antibiotics over the counter. Cheap. One warning in general...always carry plenty of cash with you when you're going out for the day. Lots of places don't take credit cards...including many gas stations, toll booths, etc. Don't get stuck. That's it.

We booked our units through an RCI exchange. The resort is absolutely beautiful inside & out. The people are very friendly & go out of their way to accommodate. We had two units & asked to be close together, and they gladly honored our request. The pools are unbelievable!! The beach area has plenty of sun & shade. It is pretty much impossible to get in the water on the beach, but the pools more than make up for that. We always got a place on the beach that was close enough to go to the pool whenever we wanted. There were 8 of us & we never had any problem getting chairs at the pool or beach any time of the day. We have stayed at resorts in Florida where people line up before the pools open & then literally race to the chairs in order to get one for the day. That was not the case here. We never went to the pool or beach before 9:00 and sometimes it was later. We found the Havana Moon very good for breakfast. We ate at the pool bar a couple of times for lunch, the beach buffet & the Del Lago buffet at night. The food was good and reasonably priced and the entertainment was very good. Service was excellent. We liked not having to carry cash, but trying to keep our charges separate & then figuring out the rate of exchange was somewhat a problem. Seems the exchange rate changes daily so it is really hard to figure. The daily maid service was unsurpassed. The shuttle service could use some improvement. The shuttles have colored flags on them to indicate where they are going, but we learned you could not always go by the color of the flag. It takes a while to figure out. The shuttles only run to the Mayan Palace Lobby & the Del Lago restaurant, which is the one to take if you are trying to get to the pool area. We were in building 8 of the Grand Mayan, & since it was all adults, the walk was not bad once we learned our way around. Riding the shuttle into Playa del Carmen was a good way to get there. The price for a round trip was $6 which we thought was very reasonable. The 8 of us agreed this was one of the best vacations we have ever had. The RCI exchange made it possible to enjoy a fabulous vacation. We would DEFINITELY return to this resort.", "Date": "April 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vicenza, Italy", "Title": "\u201cRelaxing Stay\u201d", "Author": "Coril77", "ReviewID": "UR14886613", "Content": "We arrived in Cancun missing 2 of our 4 pieces of luggage. Due to the late hour the Concierge was not in. The next day, however, they did a great job of repeatedly calling the airline to help track down our luggage (which did arrive!). The resort is beautiful! Lush greens and flowers all over. There was some construction going on, but the resort is so large, it didn't bother us. Everything is neat and clean. The rooms are modern and well kept. The staff is extremely polite and helpful. There are three restaurants, one sandwich shop, and room service. The prices are what you would expect to pay on a vacation, but we didn't find them outrageous. Our room didn't have a kitchen (some did) and that would've helped save a little money. We definately would've wanted a kitchen if we would've had our two daughters, but we didn't, so it didn't bother us too much. Things are spread out and there is a bit of walking, so if you aren't used to that or have little kids it could be a hassle. They do have trams that will take you around if you need them. If you are used to walking though it is nice to walk. There are no hills or anything to make it hard. The pool area is gorgeous, but if you want to rent a pool bed with shade(I forget the actual name of these structures), you need to get there early. They begin rentals at 7:15, I got there at 7:20 and there was a huge line. There were two people in front of me when they announced that they were all taken for the day. You can only reserve them that day or for the next day, due to other plans we were not able to rent one. The beach area is nice too. Not great for swimming due to rocks and reefs, but the water was too rough for my taste anyway (I don't know if this is typical, seasonal, or due to a storm). It was still fantastic to sit on the beach, watch and listen to the waves. Playa del Carmen is a 20 min. bus ride. You can use the hotel bus. They recommend booking 2 days in advance for this, but we were unaware of this. The Concierge checked and said there were two seats left though, so we took them. Upon boarding the bus there were no seats. We sat on the floor of the bus. You can cross the highway (vey busy, be careful) and catch a city bus (collectivo) and take that in for 2 pesos ($2) also. Or take a taxi for $20. In Playa we stuck to 5th avenue and had a nice time buying souvenirs in the local shops and eating in the restaurants. We also booked tours to Tulum with Xel-Ha and Chitzen-Itza (sorry if the spelling is incorrect). We did not use the resort. We found it way cheaper to book it in Playa. Tulum and Xel-Ha was great! Tulum was a beautiful set of Mayan ruins. Xel-Ha was a great all-inclusive water resort. We definately could've spent more time at Xel-Ha, and would consider booking a trip there without seeing Tulum (but I wouldn't want to miss out on Tulum either!). Chitzen-Itza is another set of Mayan ruins, and was neat and I am glad we went. It was a three hour drive, with a stop to go the bathroom and explore the little town we stopped in, and then lunch in the town the ruins are in. I would say that if you have the time and money - go. But I wouldn't go back to see it again. If you have to choose, then go to Tulum. The only thing is that Chitzen-Itza has the typical Mayan pyramid temple, Tulum does not. Overall we really enjoyed the resort and our trip. We were talking about coming back before we even left! It is great for people who want a quiet relaxing time, or people with a family. If you want the partying, nightclub scene I would recommend finding somewhere closer to Playa or Cancun. My other piece of advice is take some time the first day to plan what you want to do. That way if you want to reserve a pool bed or a seat for the bus into town, you can without learning you are too late.", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cincinnati", "Title": "\u201cchlorine only!\u201d", "Author": "Musketucky", "ReviewID": "UR14886784", "Content": "Spent the first week in April at the Grand Mayan with my wife and two teenage daughters.

I felt compelled to write a review because I read other people's reviews but still stayed at this hotel! We were in a 2 bedroom suite. The rooms very very nice and the best feature of this property. We were in Building 10 - which was just a 10 minute walk to the pool. Lie. It was a 10 minute run. They promised lots and lots of shuttle. Lie. The shuttles didn't run on a schedule and rarely took you where you needed to go. There were not enough shuttles during peak times i.e. 5:00 when everyone was leaving the pool area. The pool was very big and there were always enough lounge chairs. The palapa's were awesome. We were traveling with a 6 month old baby and he was able to nap easily and stay out of the sun. The catch...you have to be in line down by the pool (never any morning shuttles) by 6:45ish to rent a palapa. You can rent 2 days at a time but are always sold out so you have to go each morning. Unfortunately, if you need shade then don't plan on sleeping in. The pool itself was very dirty. The suntan oil seems to pool in areas with dirt and there weren't many people cleaning the pool. The food at the restaurants were good. Room service was good except the breakfast was always cold. We ordered dinner one night and it was very good. Most employees were friendly but couldn't or wouldn't answer questions. Especially about the shuttles! If you like really big resorts this is a good choice. But request a room in building 1-3 if you want to be close to the pool/beach.

The resort is gorgeous. It is also huge. I didn\u2019t think anywhere could be larger than the Hilton Waikoloa on the Big Island of Hawaii, but this resort is bigger. You need to get around by tram which they say run every 10-15 minutes. We only waited one or two times longer than 5 minutes. The one time we did wait 30 minutes, but that was unusual. It is a long walk to anywhere on the resort, especially if you stay in the newest buildings. Buildings with the lower numbers are closer to the restaurants and pools, but the buildings with the higher numbers are usually quieter because they are further from the action and also newer so they have bigger rooms. Our 2-bedroom was huge. It had 2 baths and 2 Jacuzzi tubs which were supplied with bath candles, bath salts, etc. Very nice touch! The bathrooms were large and the toilet area was separated by a frosted glass door. The balcony was large and included a little sitting pool. Very relaxing! Check in was very easy. Be prepared, though, that this is a cashless resort. That means that you can only charge food and beverages to your room. I didn\u2019t like the fact that if you stay at the Grand Mayan, you are immediately \u201cbranded\u201d at check in. They insist that you must wear a plastic bracelet around your wrist the entire time. I found this offensive, especially when while I was in Playa del Carmen, a taxi driver saw me walking by and said \u201cWant a taxi to Grand Mayan?\u201d I prefer not to wear where I am staying on my sleeve, literally! Also, as a cashless resort it is necessary to save each and every receipt for what you charge to your room. Be diligent. I kept all my receipts and when I checked out, I went over the bill and could not account for a charge of over $650 pesos. The clerk assured me that he would show me the receipt and pulled out the receipts from the entire week for my building. It wasn\u2019t there. They he went on-line to \u201cprove\u201d to me that the charge was mine by telling me what I ordered at the restaurant. When he started with a daiquiri, I had to stop him and tell him I have never had a daiquiri and my husband doesn\u2019t drink them either. After a spirited discussion, the charge was taken off my bill. Another feature of a cashless resort is that you have no control over the tipping; it works just like a cruise ship, the tip is automatically put on your tab with each charge even if it is only a beer at the pool. This gives the servers no motivation to give you good service. The best service was at the Balche snack restaurant. Dinner service was quick and the food was super. We ate dinner there once and lunch twice. The food and service was excellent all three times - excellent value for the money. Havana Moon was awful. We ate a dinner and breakfast there and the service was bad both times; the food was so-so. Not worth the money. The buffets are expensive so if you don\u2019t eat a lot, I don\u2019t think that they are a good value for the money. The buffet restaurant offers free entertainment nightly and the night we went we couldn\u2019t wait to finish our drinks. The entertainment was painful to watch. I have seen much better grade-school productions. We used room service once because others on TripAdvisor said that the prices were good (they were) and that the delivery was good. We waited over an hour and then they called to say that they had dropped our try and it would be another 20 minutes. After 30 minutes they showed up with only one meal. We had to wait another half hour for the other meal. I wouldn\u2019t room service again. Playa del Carmen has excellent restaurants. I want to recommend one that is not usually visited by tourists; Alux. It is in a cave! The food is excellent and you will adore the unusual ambience. No, it isn\u2019t cold and damp. The temperature is quite pleasant. The lighting is amazing. The place goes on forever; there are at least 3 bars, lots of seating including futon-type chairs, areas with linen-like drapes pulled back, lots of dinner seating, a belly dancer for entertainment and great service. We found it by talking to a local jewelry store clerk who frequents the place when he has visitors from out of town. Take the highway into Playa del Carmen and turn right (away from the tourist area) on Juarez. It is about 3 blocks down on the left. No neon signs or big advertisement, just a small sign. Doesn\u2019t look like much outside, but when you start to walk down this long staircase lit with luminaries, you will be enchanted. It was the dinner highlight of the trip. As for being a timeshare, they tried to get us to tour when we first checked in; promised us the usual gifts, etc. We just kept saying no for about 5 minutes and they never bothered us again. I met a lot of owners that love the place and also tell me that the Grand Mayan in Puerta Vallarta is excellent as well. If you are going to do any tours without booking it through Grand Mayan\u2019s travel department, be aware that they do not allow any outside vendors on the premises. You must meet your tour bus out on the road (a long walk from your room). If you decide to stay in building 13 (the last and newest building), be aware that they are building a new lobby (the old one burned down and they are currently using a tent outside of building 13 to serve as the lobby) and the construction noise can be a pain. I had to call a couple of nights because at 11 PM they were still hammering and sawing. After a hard day of touring, I just wanted to sleep. The room attendants are very good, but speak little, if any English. The concierge staff speaks English but not all that well. I also noticed that the staff will tell you want you want to hear. So don\u2019t be surprised that if you do mention that there is a problem, they will tell you that it will be fixed right away, but when you check out the problem will still exist. The pool area is lovely. You can reserve the palappas every morning, but once they are gone you will have to wait until tomorrow to reserve one. If you are fair skinned and looking for shade and do not reserve the palappas, then you will need to reserve your chair with a towel around 6 AM. Yes, the shade chairs go quickly, and that is a bit of a pain - to have to get up that early if you are staying in the outer buildings. It is about a 20-25 minutes walk to the pool and then back again. The trams aren\u2019t usually running that early. By the time you get back, it is nearly 7 and time for breakfast. Even with the resorts idiosyncrasies, we enjoyed our stay immensely. The area is wonderful. Cancun wasn\u2019t anything special, but Isla of Mujeres is a must. So much fun to tool around in a golf cart for the day and visit the lighthouse and the turtle sanctuary. Have lunch as soon as you get off the ferry at the restaurant just to your left. Great fish tacos and beer for very little dinero. Tulum was my favorite of all the sights we saw. I assumed it would be Chichen Itza, but Tulum was far better. The vendors must stay outside the ruin area and the grounds are beautifully kept. We ate lunch there as well and the food was excellent. If you do not take a tour and drive yourself, hire an English speaking guide before entering the ruins. It was $53 USD for both of us and included an hour tour with the guide and transportation from the entry into the ruin area. A nice perk when the sun is very hot. Chichen Itza is much larger but not well kept up. And vendors are inside the ruin area and everywhere you look. It was actually pretty tacky looking. I was disappointed. Tulum was far better.

The reason for saying this is that many non-timeshare owners go to timeshare resorts and complain about things that aren't similar to a hotel and complain about timeshare sales people. It helps to know what you will likely encounter before you go. That said, this resort is beautiful. Firstly the resort has grown by leaps and bounds since we first visited 5 years ago. The Grand Mayan (GM) shares the grounds with Mayan Palace (MP) units. There are now 13 GM buildings and about 20 MP buildings with more being constructed. The pools at this resort are truly mindbooggling. The MP pool is considerably larger and busier than the GM pools, so as a GM guest it's really up to your party whether you want to be in a busier (and noisier) setting or around the somewhat quieter GM pool(s). Both pools have daily activities (aquarobics, bartending classes, Salsa lesson etc ) but the MP activities tend to better attended. The pools are fabulous regardless of which you choose. The MP is a 3 tiered pool, leading down to the ocean (with 2 swim-up bars, if that's important to you), the GM pool is an infinity edge overlooking a man-made lagoon. They are in the process of building another GM pool that will be in the centre of a series of very large Palapas. It was several of these Palapas that were the scene of the fire in January this year that other reviews detail. At the time of our visit, they were in the process of welding and sand blasting the metal supports for the Palapas damaged in the fire, but replacing Palm fronds had not commenced - I hope until after the welding had finished. Both pools have loungers and chairs around as well as some, but not enough umbrellas. The ubiquitous \"chair savers\" are out in full force by about 7:00 a.m. (what time do these people get up???) placing towels on their \"favourite\" spaces. By the end of the second week we were there though, the security guards were enforcing the 1 hour saving rule at the GM pools - not at the other pools or the loungers on the beach. Since we were there during Presidents week, leading into spring break, it was difficult to find chairs around the MP pool after about 11:00 a.m. and there were never enough umbrellas. So be prepared. The MP pool also has palapa beds that you can reserve for $30.00 per day. This $30.00 is refundable with the same amount in food and beverage purchases, which isn't hard to do. The beach is good for lounging and watching the ocean, but the water entry is very rocky and the surf fairly strong, so it's not what I would call a \"carribean swimming beach\". You can however walk to the north for about 20 minutes or so, past the Valentin AI to the beach at Playa Secreto where there are no rocks, or walk south past the Iberostar for additonal swimming in the ocean. Personally however ,that's just way too much effort for me for a swim when the pools are right there. There are a number of quite decent restarants on site (Tramonto resto, wine bar and cigar bar $$$, dinner only from 6:00 p.m.; Balche and Frida $ to $$ around the pool open all day as well as for dinner, Havana Moon resto and bar on the ocean, though not an open air facility open for B, L and D $$ and finally Brio - a juice/smoothy/light lunch bar upstairs in the spa/gym $ ). We didn't find the prices outrageous (they add 15% to all bills for staff gratuities) and the service and the food tends to be very good. But when we go to a timeshare we tend to cook a number of meals, including dinner in, and we also like exploring the very vibrant resto scene in Playa Del Carmen (don't miss many of those resto) . There is also a small, but reasonably well stocked grocery on-site and a take-out coffee and pastries area. If you intend to cook, you will need to go to Playa Del Carmen (either in a Taxi, by car or on the resort shuttle) to shop at the Mega or the Walmart Superstore, all on 30th at Constitutienes. The accomodations at the GM are very nice (beds are hard, but that's typical of Mexcio) with TV's in each bedroom and in the living room. The rooms are well taken care off, with excellent daily maid and turndown service. (don't forget to leave a tip for these girls as they work really hard) If there is a maintenance issue, just call housekeeping and it will be taken care of. All the staff, wherever we went were polite and helpful and seemed happy to see you. 2 bedroom units in the GM sleep about 6 to 8, but 2 of those 8 need to be children and anyone checking in has to over 21 I believe. The kitchen in the unit consists of a 3/4 fridge, 4-burner stove top, sink and microwave, no oven, but it was good for our party of 2 adults and 3 college age girls. There are of course 2 complete and well appointed bathrooms in the 2 bedroom unit with separate shower and jacuzzi bathtubs. We did rent a car (and parking at the resort was free) because we like to go exploring along the coast and have driven in Mexico before. We had terrific maps from Laura at Mapchick. Check-in, which sometimes can be a nightmare at timeshares when the sales agents are jockeying to sign clients up for \"tours\", was good. About a week before, I had requested (by email to the resort) that we be placed in buildings 1 through 7, whcih are closer to the amenities than 8 through 13 and the check-in staff accomodated us. Of course requests are not guaranteed, but this staff seemed to try harder than at the MP Nuevo Vallarta location where we were in November 2007. As far as the timeshare sales tour goes, this is high pressure, so if you sign up, be prepared and if you don't want to spend the 3 hours++ on a tour, just say \"no thanks\" . In my experience they won't bother you again during your holiday. Our first week was an RCI exchange and our second was a rental booked through Trish Scheller who sells on Ebay under the name Bible Way Enterprises. We would not hesitate to use Trish again as she has a number of units available at this and other Mexico resorts. She was very helpful and all reservation documentation was available in a timely manner. As a final comment, we like to travel and we own timeshares including a 1 bedroom at the MP. The Grupo Mayan resorts, of which the GM in the Riviera Maya is one, are all beautifully appointed and well maintained. But generally they tend to be quite BIG resorts. We can live with that and the amenities are not hard to take. We would would not hesitate to return to this resort for either a family or couples vacation in the sun and on this coast of Mexico.

DO NOT book in advance with those popular websites...I paid 490$ including full insurance for a minivan for a week. The average price on those websites, insurance included (35$ a day) is around 750$. All I did was walk up to the Hertz booth at the airport, asked the guy for his best price, negociated a bit and voila! There is a ton of companies at the airport, so competition is fierce and they will not let you go....We used our minivan all week and even went to Chichen Itza (which I highly recommend BTW). HOWEVER, and read carefully, BEWARE of gas stations.... REALLY! Get out of your car, and look at the pump to make sure it is at 0, then do not take your eyes off the price for a second...do not speak with the other attendant trying to ask you if you are having a good vacation or asking you if he can clean the windows....We got scammed at least once for sure: the attendant was filling up the minivan and the cost was going to be around 250 pesos (25$ for half the tank, which is a good price) and at the end (10 seconds later...) we took our eyes off the pump for a second and we heard \"beep, beep, beep\" when we turned around the price was at 450 pesos (45$ for half the tank...but a day earlier we had filled 3/4 of the tank for 37$). We knew something was wrong but could not argue with what was written on the pump...so we paid and left....grrrr.....So, DO NOT take your eyes off the pump for any reason, EVER! Check-in: a breeze. We got there, they took our info, we made a few demands and that was it. Yes, we dealt with the timeshare salesmen, but we said no and never heard from them again. This is how every resort with timeshare works....The valet took our car, then once we were ready he came back with it and brought our luggage to our rooms....Not only that, but he sat next to me in the van and showed me the way around the resort, then he parked the car and brought the key back to the room...We were 4 adults (me, my wife and my parents) and we brought our 20 month old daughter along. They divided the luggage and made no mistake as to which went where. Rooms: we had asked for a room close to the pool area, since my parents are in their sixties and since we had the baby, but they could not accomodate us. We ended up in building 11, which is the second farthest (more on the walking, the shuttles and all that later). We had asked for a fridge in our hotel room so we could keep milk and some medication cold. At check-in they said they would do anything to find one and they did...it was there before we were settled in! As for the rooms themselves, they are great. Clean, modern, beautiful! We had two hotel-size rooms. One big issue though is the noise. The problem is with the door shared with the room next to you. That's all there is between you and your neighbors. Usually, there are two doors and 6 inches of wall, but at the GM, there is one wooden door. So it's like your neighbors are in your bathroom...think about it. We were lucky enough to have not too noisy neighbors, but I can't imagine what it would have been to have party animals next door. Our neighbors were just speaking, laughing and yelling a bit like you do with friends and we could hear everything. As for the walls, they are a bit thin too....the other neighbors DEFINITELY had a great time ;) Huge resort: It's big, but I expected it to be much bigger from all the reviews. You only need to use about 1/3 of the resort during your stay. That is, from you room to the pool, to the restaurants... You do not need to go anywhere else...We pretty much walked all week, since we do not like waiting for anything. Moreover, the grounds are so clean and beautiful that you want to walk them. Don't forget that my father is old and sick, that we had a baby and, hence, a ton of stuff to bring everywhere....and we walked! It's not that big and it's nice to walk 15 minutes in the sun surrounded by the beauty of the resort. We took the shuttles a few times when they happened to be there when we were leaving. But they seem to run quite frequently and you can choose where you go...I recommend not going to the lobby to try to catch another shuttle, but to the Del Lago restaurant, for it is closer to the pools. In the end, the walking was great for all of us...who doesn't need to walk more? And who is in such a hurry on their vacation not to take 15-20 minutes to take a relaxing walk to the beach or pool? Pool: now THOSE are huge!!! and beautiful! The exclusive GM pool is almost breathtalking by the way it is set up over the lake and the big pool is simply fantastic. The only thing is that it is too hot. Finding shade can be an issue but we never had much of a problem, but I recommend getting up early. I also recommend reserving a palapa for 30$ the day before you plan on going to the pool for the whole day. They are comfortable and the cost is waived if you spend 30$ on food and drinks (not hard at all)... Beach: YES! It is rocky and impossible to swim....Get over it! Now you know! We knew that beforehand and planned a few trips to Playa del Carmen and other beaches on the riviera (simply gorgeous). However, the sand is great and you can find some nice seashells. Service: the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. No, they do not speak much English...But remember that you are going to Mexico not North America....Since my Spanish is pretty good, we never had an issue, but I understand that it can be frustrating if you can't communicate...but that is YOUR problem...not theirs...Moreover, the important staff (not to say that maids and bellboys and other helpers are not important, but you know what I mean) speaks English. Food: DO order room service and OFTEN. It is relatively fast, the delivery guys are awesome, the food is good and not too expensive. The only problem is that the food is sometimes cold, but that is to be expected when ordering toasts for breakfast or a club sandwich for dinner (bread does not stay warm for long...) AVOID the Havana Moon restaurant. The service is REALLY REALLY slow, and the food is subpar. But I recommend ordering pizza from them, either to your room or at the pool...delicious! The Del Lago buffet is really good, but pricy. We did not try the Tramonto. All in all this is a great resort. And as one of the reviewers said \"know what to expect\" and you will not be disappointed. Finally, the golf course is great and the price of 69$ per person for 18 holes including clubs and a cart is really cheap.

We previously stayed two weeks at the GM in Acapulco \u2013 so we knew what to expect. Check in is horrendous they say (I thought it was okay) \u2013 except we arrived at 2ish and were told we could get our suite at 5pm only, in building #5 or take a room now in building #12. We waited: turns out our room was in building #4\u2013 thankfully so, it was a few less hundred (thousand) steps walked over the course of our 1 week stay! Our luggage stayed at the front hall (outside), and we headed to the GM pool. The layout of the resort is a problem to many \u2013 it is huge and everywhere you go, you have to walk a ways! Yes, there are shuttles, but never when you wanted one. I don\u2019t mind walking, but if it rains and you are dressed for dinner--with heels on\u2026 not so good. :-) If you have problems walking\u2026 then you may not enjoy it so much. It seems there is a local building code that forbids any building higher than three stories. GYM: Nice gym overlooking the beach area and the Brio Spa is luxurious as was expected. A little busy at times (cardio, weights, and classes available). Again it\u2019s a workout getting to the gym which is at the opposite end of the resort for most; it\u2019s located near the beach! ROOMS: There are no rooms on the beach here, all in-land \u2013 3 floor buildings with \u201cvery slipper when wet floors!\u201d Beware!!! It is a very clean & quiet resort with great maid service. Few minor room glitches \u2013 had to call for the room safe, it was missing. So were the wine bottle opener and one of the T.V. remotes. They addressed this quickly and satisfactorily once I called POOL: We tanned at the Grand Mayan pool vs the busier (loud) and endless Palace Pool! The pool bar staff were there when you needed them, and stayed away if you didn\u2019t. Drinks were mediocre --- we managed to bring a few in cooler mugs and bought a few of their daily specials, but were not overly impressed. SUNDRIES STORE: Great store where you can buy groceries & sundries \u2013 even a deli & pastry counter within. Prices are higher than what you\u2019d pay if you stocked up at the Playa del Carman Wal-mart\u2026 When in Playa we made a point of getting drinks, food, snacks and bottled water and taxied back with our goods. RESTAURANT: We ate twice at Havanna Moon (on the beach) \u2013 service extremely slow. Which meant cold food at times, but it was good and not too expensive. Ate at the Balche (Mexican fare) once and it was fine. Often both had waiting times of \u00bd hour or more, yet we got tables much faster. We had two of the most delicious dinners at the Tramonto Restaurant. Reservations a must---do so before you go if you have a special evening planned. The tuna & Chateaubriand were outstanding. Service was personable. Kids unfortunately are welcome & abundant; wish it were adults only (less noisy) and the attire was way too casual. Did not eat at the buffet Del Lago \u2013 seemed expensive, and the one show we attended was a flop. SHUTTLE & DAY TRIPS: Their shuttle service to Playa is a joke! It\u2019s only $2/pp each way but the problem is you have to \u2018reserve\u2019 a spot the day prior!!! No winging it here!!! Taxis to town were approx $15-$20usd/each way (it\u2019s an easy 20 minute drive). You can also try taking the public bus (mini-bus/van like service) at approx $2 also. Problem is, you have to 1st get yourself to the main entrance (quite the walk) and then cross a very busy highway\u2026 then you just wait and flag it down. Various tours are available, but we rented a car on-site (Alamo: $60usd/day, unltd mileage) Prices vary if you book two or more days. Driving is fine, just watch the highway speed bumps!!! A taxi ride back to the airport cost us $30usd (we shared the ride with another couple). Apparently there was a shuttle minutes earlier that we missed, not sure the price nor do we recall getting schedule for it. CONS: Again I can not stress the walking \u2013 the resort is big, and the daily walking to and from the gym \u2013 pools, the store, the restaurants, takes a toll by the end of the week. Shuttle service(s) to Playa are a joke, and not accommodating. I\u2019m on vacation, I should be able to \u201cfly by the seat of my pants\u201d and be able to take advantage of this service. A service it is not. If the Mayan is serious about the shuttle perhaps more busses is the answer. CAUTION: A few weeks prior to our Feb stay, the Grand Mayan Check-in Building burned down. It was located next to the Grand Mayan Pool - - so if you are staying in GM buildings 1 & 2 or lounging by the GM Pool you are burdened by the constant noise of the rebuilding. From dozers to compressors and painting smells\u2026 it left quite literally a bad taste. I complained twice on the Saturday before we left\u2026 all morning the workers/machines were at it\u2026 give me a break, it was Saturday a.m. Finally by mid-afternoon they were quiet. I\u2019d recommended it and would return (although I still prefer their Acapulco location/layout better).", "Date": "March 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "wisconsin", "Title": "\u201cMemorable but Massive\u201d", "Author": "WisconsinLea", "ReviewID": "UR14325068", "Content": "We are a family of four (2 teens).

We ate 2 meals a day, (usually buffet type), and had a few snacks in the unit bought in Playa. We had lots of day trips, which I would have felt compelled to stay at resort and get \"money's worth\" had we chose the AI type of resort. However, these day trips and excursions are very possible w/booking online direct thru various companies (often offering transportation), or riding resort arranged buses to Playa, Cancun, or excursion they line up (with a cut for them, I'm sure).

This was our 4th trip to a Grand Mayan property as owners. While I do agree that this is a large vacation complex there are many ways to get around and frankly if you take your time it is not bad to walk or wait on a shuttle. We never took one shuttle between buildings our entire trip. Granted we were in the #3 building so we were not too far as some of the other buildings. I walked out to check out the newer buildings and it was really not that far. We had no trouble with check in or out. Our bill was 100% correct. The daily maid service was great and room service was excellent! There are shuttles that will take you to and from Cancun and Playa that make it very inexpensive to go and see the sites. The Playa shuttle will drop you at Mega where you can buy all the things you need to back at the room for margaritas and other things that you might want to eat, drink, or just forgot to pack. The shuttles can be setup with the concierge desk and it will be billed to your room to make it easy. Do not forgot to tip the driver!

I had stayed there a number of years ago, and decided to go back. This time we had a two-bedroom unit in Building 11, among the farthest buildings on the enormous grounds. It was a beautiful, spacious unit, with a small kitchen (granite countertop), two bathrooms, one bath, one Jacuzzi, 3 TVs, and a balcony. While the furnishings are lovely, the unit has no kettle, soup, ladle, paper towels or napkins. Chambermaids do not wash dishes and there is no dishwasher. I don't mind washing dishes but the drain board is of such poor quality that dishes cannot stand and topple over. If these were the only issues I had with the property, I would happily recommend it. But that is not the case. The complex is made up of two classes of properties: the Mayan Palace and the Grand Mayan. The latter property is the more luxurious brand, and the one we stayed in. For some reason, the designers of this property decided, in their infinite wisdom, to have VIP guests stay as far away as possible from any of the action. Why, then, would guests staying in this section of this enormous property (translation: small village) have to walk farther to any of the restaurants, pool areas or the beach than those staying the Mayan Palace? Why would it not provide adequate shuttle service to and from the rooms? My guests and I spent as long as 40 minutes waiting for shuttles whenever we wanted to go to the pool or beach. The walk for us was at least 20 minutes, and that\u2019s for strong, able-bodied people in shape. This is not a property for elderly or handicapped people. For some strange reason, shuttles to buildings located closer to the action came more frequently. When we asked the staff standing at the shuttle area desk to call someone and let them know how long we were waiting, they declined, telling us to just wait. The walkie-talkies in their hands were apparently mere ornaments. To avoid the wait for the shuttle or the long walk, we carried enough things to ensure we made the trip as little as possible. Our load was heavy and when the shuttle didn\u2019t come, as was often the case, our walk was made more unpleasant because of all the things we\u2019d carried to the pool and beach. Shuttle service definitely needs to be more frequent, especially to outlying buildings like the one we were in. Service in general is sorely lacking despite the copious number of staff they have on hand. People do not speak English well, and misunderstand questions. Even when one speaks perfect Spanish, they still fail to give proper service. Our Mexican friend who was staying with us had arranged for the hotel shuttle to pick her up from the airport. When her plane was delayed 3 hours, she was considerate enough to call long distance from Mexico City so that the driver would not have to wait unnecessarily for her. When she finally boarded, she called again. Yet, when she arrived, the driver was no where to be seen. She waited 30 minutes for him, having to call from her cell phone again to the hotel. No apology was offered either from the concierge or the driver when he finally showed up. In fact, he told her that she should have been looking for him \u2013 not he looking for her. I asked the front desk for an umbrella, was sent to the concierge, who called the bell boy to see if they had them, and then was directed to get one from them. I walked back to through the lobby to the bell boy, and asked for an umbrella. The bell boy said \u2018we don\u2019t have any.\u2019 I told the two bell boys that the concierge had called in front of me and spoken to someone, who had assured her that they had one for me. He looked at me skeptically, called the concierge, and told me that no one in the concierge station had had a conversation with anyone about an umbrella. I said that I had just come from there, and the concierge had indeed called the bell boy in front of me. He looked at me disdainfully and repeated that the concierge did not speak to anyone about an umbrella. Apart from the sheer rudeness of this, he did nothing to get me an umbrella. Nor did he ask me to follow him to the concierge when I went back to complain. He just stood there, while I walked back to the concierge, who upon seeing me again, was surprised to hear how I was treated. She walked back with me, and as I went over to the bell boy, I was intercepted by the bell captain, presumably his boss, who enquired what was going on. I told him the story, he apologized, then gave me two umbrellas that I had to sign for, and agree to pay 400 pesos if I lost them. I said that I only needed one, but he insisted on giving me two \u2013 and making me responsible for both of them should I lose them. Misunderstandings like this were common throughout our week at the Grand Mayan. Chambermaids turned down our beds and made the sofa beds only on some days; on other days they did not. When we called down to complain, no apology was offered. Rather, we were told that the woman who normally does this must be off. Only one of the restaurants takes reservations so on a day when it poured, we had to line up for hours to get a table. No one gave us any information about the activities going on in the evenings, like the beach party on Sunday night or the Mexican fiesta on another. Both we missed. Nothing was posted anywhere, and when we asked the staff if they could tell us about the activities of the day, they said they didn\u2019t know. One night, we called the concierge and asked them to make a reservation at a restaurant we liked, Casa Di Agua. When we arrived at the restaurant, the maitre d\u2019 said that they had explained to the concierge that they were fully booked, and that we would have to wait for a cancellation. No one had called to inform us of this detail. We took the stretch and water aerobics classes. Both were run by people with little training or knowledge. We got no effective work out from either \u2013 but lots of sexual innuendos. This may be cute in a club, but when I go to get a work out, I prefer that instructors act professionally. Among other disappointments at this resort was the beach. It is very rocky, and impossible to swim in because of the large stones and other articles in the water. We found two rusty nails and showed them to the staff. They simply shrugged. Among the worst changes from my first visit to this one was the fight for shade around the pool. When I was there a few years ago, there were fewer buildings and easy access to shade, especially among the gorgeous palapas equipped with king-size beds. We never had to fight to get one and there was no charge. This time, the resort charged 300 pesos to reserve a palapa, and there were simply not enough umbrellas for people needing shade. It required us to get up very early to ensure that we could find a place to shelter us from the tropical sun. People often hoarded more chairs than they used, and there were many people with burns because they simply could not find a shady area. When I complained to the staff about this, they shrugged their shoulders and said: \u201cPeople complain about that all the time. That\u2019s what the hotel wants.\u201d Despite the beautiful trappings, I cannot recommend a place where the staff have not been sufficiently trained in customer service and where there is so little regard for the comfort and convenience of guests that there are not enough shuttles and umbrellas to accommodate guests.", "Date": "March 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Beautiful Idaho", "Title": "\u201cDepends on what you are looking for.....\u201d", "Author": "sdemoss", "ReviewID": "UR14191515", "Content": "We just got back from a week at the Grand Mayan. The grand master suite was a gift, so it is hard to complain about anything. However, if I were paying retail price to stay at this resort, I would be much more critical. -The resort is very large. We were placed in building 6 after initially being placed in 9 and begging for something closer because my husband had sprained his ankle the day before and had to use crutches or a wheelchair the first few days we were there. I wouldn't mind the location of buildings 1-7 as the walk to the pool and restaurants is nice, but buildings 9+ seem out in the middle of nowhere. It was nice to have the excercise, however. -The food tends to be expensive. Water ($4 large bottle) and beer ($3.70) is expensive, so load up on it elsewhere. Sometimes you will find water in the lobby for free, but that was not consistent. It is 1/2 the price to buy it in the little market near the pool than to order it from a waiter or room service.

Besides, if you are drinking pina coladas ($6.50) and blended margarita's, what's the difference? We bought our beer from the market next to the bus terminal on 5th Ave in Playa for $6 a six pack. You probably could see how many you could order during the resort's happy hour 2 for 1 special which would put the beers around $ 1.85 or so a piece. We took our own cooler to the beach. -Book your shuttles to town, dinner reservations at Tramonto, excursions, palpas etc. early in the week. -Watch out for the bug sprayers. If you hear something that sounds like a leaf blower heading toward your room, hurry and shut the doors. I wouldn't ever leave the doors open while we were out because who knows what kind of chemicals are in that spray. -Keep tabs on your pool towels as our maid took ours from our room the 2nd day, thus we didn't have a towel card or a towel to turn in for a fresh beach towel and settled for a bath towel the rest of the week. -The Brio Health Bar upstairs in the gym seemed to be an overlooked place to eat lunch. I liked the smoked salmon wrap and fresh juice blends. -We did the snorkel excursion from the water sports kiosk at the resort for $45 and had a good time. Playing soccer on the beach afterward with the guides was especially fun. I enjoyed this snorkel trip maybe better than touristy Xel Ha. -We did the steak and shrimp buffet ($34)and the Mexican fiesta buffet ($54 including drinks too.) The entertainment for the Mexican fiesta was fun, however the steak and shrimp night was pretty corny. The food was good. If a guy comes around asking you to write your name down on a pad of paper, he is going to create a somewhat tacky post card with your name and ask you to buy it for $6. We politely declined. -The couple we were traveling with chose to do the time share presentation. They were told it would only take 90 mintues, but took 2.5 hours before they could get out of there. The breakfast buffet that was included was delicious and the $100 credit and 10% off the total bill at the end of the week for food and drinks was well worth it. -I was happy to see that there is a good sized sandy beach area with plenty of room for sand castle building, lounging, gazing out over the ocean, etc. The rocks that people mention would only affect those that would want to swim or walk in the surf. -They installed at least 4-5 more grass umbrellas on the beach the day before we left to provide more shade. We never had trouble finding a shady spot. I would not go back to this resort, primarily because we are a young, adventurous couple that enjoys a more authentic, quaint experience. The location was prohibitive. The staff was incredible. The service was great. It just felt like a cruise ship on land. I would actually give this 2 stars, but I think that there are a lot of people that would love the types of things that I didn't like about the place, just because I would rather be in a b&b with peace and quiet and a home cooked meal.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "CA", "Title": "\u201cvery nice place, if you know what to expect\u201d", "Author": "thanht", "ReviewID": "UR14150073", "Content": "My family of 6 stayed at the GM Riviera Maya 2/24-3/2. We got the week through a TUG classified, so it wasn't too expensive..For what we paid and for what we were expecting, it was fantastic!...minus the fact that the beach at the GM is virtually unusable. Yes, we knew that the beach would be rocky, from the reviews we read...but, since we were so pleased with the rest of the resort, it was very disappointing when we actually saw the beach. It's so rocky, you can't play in the beach *at all*, a real shame since the water there was really nice, clean, and warm...oh well, there were plenty of other places to swim... When we checked in, we asked for a room close to the lobby and pools, since we had small child (< 1 year old) staying with us. They put us in building 11...which is way out in the boonies (bldg 11 is close to nothing, except buildings 8, 9, 12, and 13, which are just other buildings where ppl like us got stuck). Well, this actually turned out to be not so bad, since (1) it was nice and quiet there (most of the time), (2) we never waited more than 5 minutes for a shuttle to pick us up whenever we needed to get to a different part of the resort, and (3) we had a rental car, so we weren't stuck at the resort exclusively. If you can afford to rent a car (it's *very* expensive to rent a car since you have to pay all these Mexican insurances), then do! You don't have to pay for parking for the rental car at the GM and there is plenty of parking available. You can explore the Riviera Maya on your own, like we did, without paying for expensive tours. After we checked in, we were asked to attend a timeshare presentation. We were firm in telling them we were not interested, and they did not give us a hard time or ask us about it again, which was really nice. Our room was a grand master suite, which is what you get when you join a grand suite with a grand master room. The suite was *very* nice. A/C controls for each bedroom as well as one for the dining&living room area. Ceiling fans in all 3 rooms as well. The ceiling fans worked really well, but there was only one setting for the fans (high speed only!). The kitchen has pretty much everything you need to make your own meals (pots, pans, cups&glasses, dishes, utensils, even a large fruit bowl and pitcher). The private terrace is very nice, especially if you are on the 3rd floor, like we were. The dipping pool is useless since it's always in the shade and the water is cold. They bugspray the [-] out of the place (from 5-8pm) but there are still a few bugs, of course, especially at night and especially if you leave wet clothes out on the terrace (we left wet clothes to dry outside on the lawnchairs one day/night..there were a bunch of bugs on the terrace the next day). Flat panel tv's in both bedrooms, flat screen tv in the living room. The beds in the rooms were the best, king size and *very* firm without being too firm to sleep on (good if you have a bad back). The water pressure in the shower was not great, but it was not bad. The rooms were always well-cleaned whenever we returned to the room in the late afternoon. We didn't always get replacement towels for the kitchen, but all we had to do was phone housekeeping to get new ones. Note: the actual housekeeping that comes by with fresh towels don\u2019t speak much English at all, so learn some Spanish to ask for what you want. The Grand Mayan pool area was nice, but not anywhere near as popular or nice as the Mayan Palace pool area (that was the place to be!). The Mayan Palace pools are super nice. There are a lot of different pools at different depths. We really liked the large shallow pool (3 or 4 ft?) and the large kids\u2019 pool (this pool has 2 levels, the one on the outside is just a few inches, the one on the inside (as you get further into the pool) is about 1 ft). GM is great if you have kids. They have a bunch of planned activities for kids, and there is a little swingset on the sand, just past the pool area. A note about returning beach towels to get your towel card back: If you want your towel card back, make sure to give them a resort \u201cbeach\u201d towel. If you hand them a \u201croom\u201d towel instead, they will hand the towel right back to you and not give you your towel card back. We gave them a room towel by accident, since the towels all looked the same to us\u2026 The Mayan Palace pool area is very large; if you take the shuttles like we did, be aware that there is a shuttle stop not only next to the Del Lago Restaurant, but there is also a shuttle stop behind the ping pong tables/towel area \u2013 this will save you a lot of walking! To our surprise, the shows at Del Lago Restaurant in the evening were really quite good! On some nights, you had to pay in order to see the shows; on other nights, you could watch the show for free. Just ask and they will tell you which nights the shows are free and which nights they aren\u2019t. We didn't try any of the resort food since we just bought fresh fruits and veggies from the Mega store in Playa del Carmen and ate at restaurants in the places we visited outside the resort. The Mega in PDC is the best place to get food, if you want to prepare your own meals. Mega has great prices, a large selection of difft items, and really tasty fresh fruits & veggies. Checkout process was slower than we expected since they ask you to fill out a somewhat long questionnaire. At least, they have someone at the ground floor of your building to do the checkout, so you don\u2019t have to go all the way back to the lobby for that. Would we return to GM Riviera Maya? No, since the resort\u2019s beach is so rocky. Would we recommend the GM Riviera Maya? Yes..because, other than the beach, everything else at the resort was really nice, especially the staff.

Plenty of kids activities. It's beautifully landscaped and well kept, it's just that EVERYTHING is a very long walk. They do have carts that will shuffle you around the resort, but you will spend a bunch of time waiting for them to show up, and then there won't necessarily be room on it for everyone that's waiting. The food at the resort is delicious, and priced very fairly. Just plan on going to the restaurants either very early or very late, otherwise you'll have a pretty long wait to get a table. The pools are immaculate. The beach is there, but it's very rocky, so it's not as if it's easy just to walk right into the ocean and go swimming. There's also quite a few construction projects going on all over the resort. And let me tell you, they start early, and work late. We did the time share presentation. They said it would only be 90 minutes, it was much closer to 2 and 1/2 hours. It wasn't that bad though, and they really do present a good deal. The incentives they offered us to go to the presentation were honored, and well outweighed the amount of time we had to spend in the actual presentation. We had planned on playing tennis and brought our own equipment, but didn't play because you have to pay everytime you want to reserve some court time. The best part of this resort is that they provide a shuttle into the beautiful Playa Del Carmen all through out the day for only $4 each round trip. A real steal compared to taking a cab for $18 each way.

It was good that we were young and mobile because even if you're in one of the closest buildings to the beach/restaurants/pools, you'll still be doing an lot of walking. We stayed one week, checking in late the night of Sat, Feb. 9 and checking out the morning of Sat. 16th. The weather was amazing- the perfect temperature, not too hot or too cold. It did rain a bit the first couple days we were there, but that was not a huge damper on our fun. Check-in was straight forward and done efficiently, although the attendant checking us in forgot to give us our towel cards- make sure that upon checking in you receive your Room Key Cards AND your towel cards (which you exchange near the pools to \"check out\" towels). I think you're charged something like $30 if you misplace your towel... We stayed in building 6, which was a good 8 min walk to the pool. At check-in I just asked politely if he could find a non-smoking room close to the pool/beach. Because I was very polite, he was very nice in return which is how we got such a good room despite checking in really late. Also, if you have any problems getting around, like knee or back troubles, be sure to tell them at check-in that you need to be put in a closer room for that reason and they\u2019ll try to accommodate you. The room was spacious and well-appointed, though the TV stations left a lot to be desired. Some in English, some in Spanish, and one in German- the selection wasn\u2019t terrific... Bring a portable DVD player if you\u2019ve got one because at the end of a busy day in paradise you might just want to soak in the 2-person tub and watch the tube. Most general staff (housekeeping/maintenance) does NOT speak English, so now's the time to brush-up. The entertainment staff and the kid's club/activities staff sports a very up-beat have-fun-at-all-cost attitude that can be fun. They were all very amiable and we took advantage of many of the activities offered. Just beware that you'll need to check the signs at both pools for the day's schedule of events because the brochure they give you when you check in may not have the up-to-date schedule. Some activities include bingo, crafts (making a beaded necklace, etc), water-aerobics, beach stretching, bike tours of the resort grounds (yes, the resort is big enough to warrant a bike tour) and a cocktail mixing lesson which is really more like an entertainment show any college frat boy, or fun-loving vacationer would enjoy. Be prepared to drink a little. As for the food, we ate at Havana Moon (right on the beach) the Brio Spa sandwich shop, and we ordered food from the pool restaurant, too (there are waiters in orange shirts that take orders for people sitting at the pool or at the beach) and we also ordered room service. ALL the food was wonderful except for the Caesar salad at Havana Moon (not enough dressing for my tastes). We were very pleased with the quality and the price/value of the food in each of the places we ate at the resort. As others have written before, the beach is REALLY rocky and the algae makes it slick as well. I did manage to make it out to the deeper water (over the rocks and coral) with bare feet, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it. If you DO have water shoes, take your snorkel and goggles if you want to see a few fish. Nothing to write home about, but it's something. As for tours, we didn't go on any provided by the resort because they were REALLY expensive. If you sit through their time-share presentation, you get a discount, but we opted not to do that based on the horrible reviews about the presentation given by others on this site and also from other vacationers we met there-- it's not worth the free breakfast/discounts! Anyway, we did a day trip to Chichen Itza that we booked in Playa del Carmen. It was 7am-7pm and was only $36 per person. It picked us up from the hotel lobby. The tour booking kiosk in Playa del Carmen was just down the street (toward the beach) from the little bus station which I'll write about later on. The trip picked us up at the hotel, then made a couple other stops to pick up the other tourist (there were only about 12 of us total). The bus was smaller, but I still thought it was comfortable, especially for the price. If you're really big or tall, you might want to book with a tour on a big bus. Then we started the drive to Chichen Itza, stopping along the way for a bathroom/souvenir-buying 15-min break. Then we spent a few hours at the ruins, then went to a buffet lunch (everything included but drinks) where we saw some Mexican dancing. Then we went to a cenotes (there are lots of different caves around and different tours go to different caves) and I swam in the cool, refreshing water. Then we stopped for 30 mins at a little village's town square, which was nice to see, and then headed back. All-in-all, a very nice and worthwhile trip that was certainly worth the $72 for the 2 of us. The only other place we visited besides Chichen Itza and Playa del Carmen was Tulum. Tulum was WONDERFUL. The weather was gorgeous, which gave us some good pictures. Wear your swim suit and bring a towel- the water/beach are terrific there at Tulum. We traveled to Tulum and Playa del Carmen on the public transport busses, which are air-conditioned adequately. They're a little small but very easy to use. To catch them, walk out of the resort. Stand anywhere on the side of the road to catch one. Stay on the resort side if you want to go to Cancun; cross the 4 lanes of heavy traffic (be careful!!!) if you want to head to Playa/Tulum. We didn't have to wait more than 3-5 mins for a bus to come by and pick us up. But beware that even just 3-5 mins in the hot sun feels a LOT longer! Also, if the bus is full, they won't stop for you. We never had ANY problems. From the GM resort it's only 15 pesos (roughly $1.50) per person to get to Playa. From Playa back up North towards Cancun and GM, the busses leave about every 10-15 mins. For comparison, the taxis waiting at the hotel lobby were charging $20 one-way to get to Playa. To get to Tulum, you exchange busses in Playa and continue on to Tulum. The busses that go from Playa to Tulum are not nearly as nice as the Cancun/Playa busses, but for $2.50 per person to get to Tulum, it was fine. These were also air conditioned. Another thing to keep in mind about the TULUM busses is that they will not leave until they are full, which means you might be sitting waiting for more passengers to fill up the bus before it leaves, which could be annoying. The Tulum busses are painted white and red. Entry into Tulum was 48 pesos. We bought all our groceries at Mega (in Playa), which is supposedly cheaper than Wal-Mart. Because we didn\u2019t have a kitchen in our room we stocked up on Ramen noodles, instant coffee mixes, and instant hot cereal and packed some food as well as eating utensils and an electric hot-water pot. We saved a TON of money by doing this because otherwise we would have had to order every meal from the hotel. If I were to go back again, I would try to book early enough to get a room with a kitchen! I have to say that one of the best things we did was get the week long pass to the Brio health club and spa. Normally it\u2019s about $35/person/day, but if you ask about their specials (and you ask and ask and ask again persistently) then they might tell you about the unadvertised special we took advantage of: 2 people get unlimited usage of all Spa and Health Club amenities for the whole week for $100. It was wonderful.... Also, don\u2019t have a heart attack when you first walk in your room and see that the price for a bottle of water is $15: The prices are in pesos, NOT dollars, so the water is only $1.50 USD. This confused me because I didn\u2019t know pesos were written with a \u201c$\u201d As for lounging on the beach- it was REALLY annoying that people would put a book or a towel on a lounge chair under the shade and then leave and NOT COME BACK the whole morning, or in some cases, the whole day. If you go, please do not do this- have respect for people who actually want to USE the chairs. About the housecleaning: I called to request that they not clean the room for the entire week (I\u2019ve had a bad theft experience at a DIFFERENT hotel, and now make sure not to have cleaning done at my hotel rooms at all). Usually my husband and I put the do not disturb sign on the door, but one morning we forgot and they still cleaned the room, even though I requested that they not clean it at all. We had NO problems at this hotel at all with theft, and the cleaning and turn-down service was lovely, but if you don\u2019t want anyone to enter, be sure to put the do not disturb sign out.

It is about 25 minutes from the Cancun Airport. Ok, we checked in and had been told(before hand) that the best rooms were near the pool so we asked about one. They didn't really say they didn't have any but said we were assigned to building 11! We were so tired we agreed. The bell hop took all of our things to the room and they parked our car. Shortly after we got to the room a maid said that the room wasn't \"ready\". The bedspreads were not on the beds. Big deal! So I said that it didn't matter. Well it did to them. They gave us a room in building 2, right by the pool, which in itself is majestic. Great, got a ride on a golf cart and had our things brought over from building 11. Great service and nice rooms. Ours had one bedroom, livingroom with a kitchenette. It was really nice. Morning came, had breakfast and went to the HUGE pool. Spent most of the day there. Get there early because there are palapas or huts that you can use all day...if you get there early. Near the pool is a casual restaurant, convenience store and the fitness center. There are activities for the kids almost all day long ending with a movie at night. We were more than please with the MEGA Resort. They turned down the covers and made the sofas into beds for the kids and of course the mints. Our main objective of this vacation was to relax and get away from Theme Parks and we accomplished that. Beware, you can't pay for anything with cash you have to sign for and pay when you check out. Tips can do wonders for the service personnel.

I do not play golf so I can not comment on the golf course, but the people I talked to seem to like it. I would first like to say that there is some truth to some the gripes that other people have posted on here. First of all, it is an extremely large property and it can be quite a hike from some of the buildings to the pool, Beach and General store. I would like to comment on the shuttle service though, I did not find it nearly as bad as some of these reviews would have you believe. We also chose to walk from our building to the main lobby and catch the pool shuttle from there. It was only about a 6 or 7 minute walk from building 9 to the lobby and the shuttle service from the main lobby was not bad, I think there were 1 or 2 times all week that we waited more than 5 or so minutes for a shuttle. I did see that depending on the shuttle from the building to the lobby could be a little more of a wait so as I said at a 5 minutes walk to the lobby was much quicker than waiting for the shuttle. As for the resort staff, we found most of them to very freindly and helpful. It is true some of the resort staff do know very little english but communication was not a major problem, with the exception of the chambermaids most of the staff that is in a role that interacts with the guests can understand and speak english well enough to communicate, and after all, considering it is us going to Mexico it would be pretty ignorant to expect the whole resort staff to speak perfect English, how about since it is us going to Mexico, we pick up a book and learn a few important key things to say in Spanish to get by. It would be best to plan ahead and use the shuttle to go into Playa to buy groceries at wal-mart, unless you enjoy paying $12 American for a six pack at the resort store. The resort does offer a shuttle to Playa starting at 9AM and back as late as 8:30 PM nd it is very in-expensive i think $8 round trip for 2 people. Cabs in Playa are also pretty reasonable $5-6 US for a cab ride in Playa. The cabs are everywhere on the resort and you will have no trouble grabbing one but it will cost $30-$40 round trip...ALWAYS try to barter with them you will usually be able to save at least $5-$10.

We are a family of four, and we stayed in the two-bedroom master suite, which had enough room for at least four more people comfortably. Our rooms were so spacious and nicely decorated! We all really enjoyed coming back to the room for the night, and take a jacuzzi in the huge tub! The maid service was very much appreciated for my family and did an awesome job everyday. We were put in building eight of the Grand Mayan, even though we requested buildings 1-5. It was actually better that we were a little bit further away from everything, and every morning the tenish minute walk to the pool and beach was very relaxing and do-able. All of the grounds in the resort could not be cleaner, it was absolute paradise! Every morning we would wake up early and go to the Belche Snack and Pool Bar to reserve our palapa for the day-a thirty dollar fee, but it is refundable if you spend more then thirty dollars by the pool that day. Something that you have to make sure of is that you keep every reciept from anything that you buy at the resort, so that you will be able to match it with your bill at the end of your trip. I thought that it was very convenient to have the no cash policy at the resort, our teenagers could go and get a snack whenever they wanted to, and pay with just their signature. We ate at Havana Moon almost every morning! It was great and really fun to take pictures on the balcony overlooking the ocean. We considered going to a buffet for breakfast at the Del Lago, but we are not very big eaters and would never get our moneys worth for what is offered. We spent almost everyday by the pool or on the beach, even though you can not swim in the ocean, the beach is beautiful, very quiet, and relaxing. We usually ordered lunch from the Belche Snack bar to eat by the pool. Since many drinks were had at happy hour, not many of us were hungry when lunch came. For dinner don't miss the Tramonto!! It was amazing, but when you get there check it out and get reservations since it fills up quick! Great food and a great experience overall. We did try the room service a few nights, but preferred to be at the reastaurants. If there was anything negative to say about the resort it would be that there is not enough variety with the food choices, mostly the same menus, so be ready to order something that you may have never had before! We saw one show at the Del Lago and really enjoyed ourselves. The number one thing that impressed us while we were staying here is that the service is great. My favorite memory from the week was that on our first day by the pool I was eating some pretzels while laying in the sun and Omar, the activities director at the resort, came over and ate some! We started talking and for the entire week he was talking to our family and even making bets about sports with us! He was so much fun and is hilarious. If you see him, talk to him and he will watch out for you while you are there. The cocktail lessons by the pool was very entertaining and a way to get free drinks! Something that the girls loved was getting henna tattoos by the pool! They also sell souveniors and offer hair braiding and constant activities for children and teens alike. The great thing about the gigantic pool is that you can be in the adult area, or the kids area, and still be part of the action!

We did an RCI exchange into it. All the reviews on this site had prepared me for the resort. It was huge! We had a grand master suite in building 9 at the Grand Mayan. The first thing I have to say is the check-in was relatively easy. Our bags were delivered immediately to our room and not once during our stay were we approached to do the dreaded timeshare presentation. The room was probably the nicest we have ever stayed in, the building is only a few years old and was beautiful. We faced the golf course (no rooms face the ocean). The first day we walked to the pool and the restaurants and after walking in 85 degree heat for 15 minutes each way we decided the shuttles were the way to go. Sometimes we were lucky and there was a shuttle right there but more often than not we had to wait. It took an average of 20-30 minutes to get from our room to the pool. If we forgot something and had to go back it was a real hassle. Definitely rent the Pallapas at the pool. It is the only shade you will find if you get down to the pool after 7 am. People start lining up at the pool at 6 am ! You can rent these the day before and they are roped off for you . Ordering $30 from the pool restaurant is no problem and they wipe the charge off for the day if you do this. Make friends, (tip) the person who reserves these and you can do a few days at a time . The pool is amazing. We used the Mayan Palace pool the entire time. The Grand Mayan pool was small and too quiet for us. We used the shuttle into Playa Del Carmen at 3 times to go in for dinner , shopping etc. It lets you off right by the Mega store and we loaded up on groceries on the way back. There is an internet cafe that charges$7 for an hour of internet time. There are sometimes long lines however if you don't have your own laptop. All in all we had a nice week but there was way too much walking and the resort is very far from any town. Playa is the closest at 30 minutes. For a resort so isolated it needed more amenities for the guests.

We have a two bedroom timeshare, and were able to exchange for the Grand Master Suite. We had done the timeshare sales pitch from the Mayan resorts the year before in Puerto Vallarta, and were very impressed with the resort there. We decided that we wanted to try staying for a week at one of their resorts, and maybe consider trading in our RCI timeshare for a Grand Mayan timeshare if we liked it. We booked a stay at the Grand Mayan in Riviera Maya almost a year ago after returning home, as it was the only one available for exchange. We booked our flight and got a rental car as part of the package. We arrived early in Cancun, and couldn't check in until after 5pm. They attempted to steer us into the timeshare sales meeting. \"only 90 minutes -- read this as more like 4 hours!!! -- tell them no immediately, and don't let them bribe you with offers of 10% off, etc. unless you are willing to give up 4 hours of sunshine and vacation time. We told the boy offering the sales presentation \"no\" one time, and they never asked us again the rest of the week. We had the rental car, so we went into Playa del Carmen and spent the afternoon there. We came back to the resort around 5:30, and went to exchange our pass they gave us earlier for our room. This was the start of the little issues which made our stay somewhat uncomfortable. First the desk clerk at the main lobby couldn't find where we had checked in, even though we had given him the slip of paper given to us confirming our room earlier that day. After standing there watching him search through his computer, he got someone to help - this took about 20 minutes or so. After getting our room key, we went to the bellboy station to get our luggage and find out where our room was. They wouldn't let us follow them to the room/building, we had to ride in their shuttle to the room, and then catch a shuttle back to the lobby to get our car. This was the second frustrating problem with the resort. After finally getting to our room, we found the bellhop had not delivered all of our luggage and we had to call them to get the other two items delivered, which was about 2 hours later. The room however was awesome and consisted of 2 separate bedroom/bath areas separated by a living/dining/kitchen area. The room was beautiful, and nicely appointed. Granite countertops, Onyx table tops, Travertine (sp?) tile floors, Jacuzzi, flat screen tv in all rooms -- all top of the line. This was the highlight of our stay! We unpacked our luggage and decided that we would try out one of the restaurants at the resort for dinner. We were in building 8, and looking at the map of the resort, it didn't seem so far to walk to the restaurant - we were badly mistaken - after walking what seemed like a mile, and getting blisters from our sandels we finally got to the place which was down by the beach. This resort is huge - there is no walking to any place unless you are in buildings 1 or 2 which are down near the beach and all the facilities, pools, etc. You have to take the shuttle anywhere you go, and they don't run according to schedule. You are told repeatedly by drivers that the \"next shuttle\" will take you where you want to go - they lie!! It was sometimes a wait of up to a half hour , and two or three different shuttles would stop before you got the right shuttle to get to where you wanted. Getting out to the main entrance to catch the bus to town is a long long walk or a long long wait for the shuttle. The restaurant we walked to was the Havanna Moon, which is a nice place, with a reasonably priced menu. Very open air, right on the water front/beach area. We found that this was the place to have dinner and breakfast which was a'la cart, and not the buffet which was served at the Lago restaurant. Havanna had a menu of items to choose from, and we were very happy with the food. One of the things we had been told the year before in Puerto Vallarta was that the breakfast buffet at all the Mayan resorts was $7.50 per person. However we were told at this resort, it was $21 PER PERSON!!!! - No breakfast is worth $42 for a couple - at least not where there is no real butter, and no real cream, etc. We found ourselves eating a lot of meals in Playa, as others had said in other reviews. The food and prices are much better in town!!! Continuing - after dinner we waited for a shuttle back to our room, and got there about 9pm. Since we had an early flight (6AM) we were tired and decided to go to bed early. We had just shut off the light, when there was a knock on the door. It was the maid wanting to turn down the bed for the night. We told her no, and went back to bed. She then knocked on the other door to our suite and when told no, walked past me and proceeded to turn down the other bed we weren't using, and asking if we wanted the couch beds set up. We tried to explain it wasn't necessary (this was our honeymoon - and only the two of us) - She didn't understand what we were saying, spoke no english - so rather than argue, we let her proceed to turn the bed down we had already been in, close all the drapes etc. Very frustrating as we wanted to sleep, and couldn't communicate with her at all. I was tired of the place already, and we hadn't even been there one day!! When the maid finally left, we got to get some sleep. The beds aren't that bad - really, they aren't! We own a 'Select Comfort' bed at home, and even compared to that, the beds at the resort were not as bad as others had said. Yes they are much more firm than a typical matress, but we both slept fine on it all week, and didn't have any problems getting comfortable. The rest of our week consisted mostly of trips to town, and we hardly ate at the resort. We did spend two separate days at the resort, and layed on the beach all day both times. We had good service from the bars, and were even served lunch, all brought right to our chairs!! The drinks are good, but limited choices on the beer, and it's all in cans (we prefer bottles) The food from the pool bar/grill is very very good, and was very reasonable. I would have to say it's probably the best place at the resort to have lunch. The burgers are great, and the Mayan Chicken wrap is quite tasty and flavorable ( spicy!)if you want to try something different. Service at the pool bar for drinks could be a bit slow, as they are also filling for the waiters/waitresses, and they seem to have priority over us (customers) sitting right at the bar. It was no faster sitting in the pool ordering your drink, than it was sitting down by the beach and waiting for the server to make the rounds. One other recommendation is to make use of room service!! The food is all prepared at a completely separate place from all the other restaurants. It's brought right to your room, the price is better than at the restaurants, and it gets to you still warm. Filet Mignon, w/ grilled vegetables, and garlic mashed potatoe -- $26 -- and it's an excellent cut of meat, not something else being labled as a filet, it's the real thing. We made use of room service about 4 times - 2 breakfast, and 2 dinners. All very good we felt for the price and convenience of not dealing with the shuttles. All in all, it was an ok place to stay, but I don't recommend it if you are looking for a fun place for singles ( lots of kids and grandparents) or honeymooners - the walls are paper thin, and the floors aren'[t much better - ie: lots and lots of noise all the time as you can hear people on both sides of you, as well as above you. Noise including TV, people out in the hall, toilets flushing, or something worse. - We were fortunate to have a choice of which side of the suite to sleep on, and so if there was too much noise on one side, we could go to the other, close the doors between, and have some quiet. Complaining to the front desk about noise does no good. We will never go there again or recommend it to friends. There is much better deals in Playa or Cancun, and you aren't stuck in the middle of nowhere, with no real beach to swim at ( it's all coral as others have said and you can't swim there). If you do decide to stay here - rent a car. Plan to eat in town often ( a secret - go to Puerto Morales - it's the real thing - town square, neat shops, etc, and not over populated like Playa or Cancun.) And make sure to ask to be in buildings 1 or 2 if at the Grand Mayan or in buildings 1-4 if at the Mayan Palace side. You will find most places walkiing distance away, and not be at the mercy of the shuttles. We read this suggestion in other reviews, but forgot to make use of it when checking in.

I truly feel some people will always find something to complain about- and remember folks, it's a 3rd world country- not the US! First off, let me say there really is no need to rent a car. We did and if we went back, we wouldn't do it again. There are just sooo many shuttle options available, taxes waiting all day onsite - it's actually easier and just as cost-effective to let someone else drive you around- and not be looking over your shoulder for police all week. And think of all the cervezas you can drink when you don't have to drive! hahaha Check-in was relatively easy- but since check-in technically isn't until 5 pm, don't expect to get in there before that time- we didn't. But we took a ride to the walmart supercenter in Playa del Carmen to kill some time and get some groceries/alcohol for the week. Upon return, our room was ready and not only did the bellman take our luggage to our room on the other side of the property, they also put our groceries in gray bins and took them over on a golf cart too! We drove over to the lot (parking is free there if you DO decide a car is essential) and went up to the room and within 5 min, our great bellhop Andreas was knocking on our door and unloading our bins- despite our insistence that we wanted to help! The resort IS huge, people are right about that.. but i think we only really waited ONCE all week for a shuttle cart to the pool. They actually have clocks on stands in front of every building/lobby/pool and before the shuttle drivers depart, they reset the clock to estimate their return time for their next group of passengers. And it was rare that we actually waited more than 2-3 minutes- they say they come every 15 min though. The distance from the rear buildings to the pool is definitely all of a mile and a half so sometimes we'd walk to the lobby, then take the shuttle to the pool- so we got SOME exercise and got to see some of the grounds too! Personally, we loved building 9- over near the golf course- not because we loved to golf- but because we were away from the noise of the main pool areas. Those of you with kids may want to stay in the lower numbered buildings (1-6) but we felt building 9 was perfect. We have no kids and enjoyed the peace and quiet! Plus, when staying in buildings 9-13, you overlook this mexican jungle area at the far end of the property. At nitetime- the Ibestar (SP?) Maya resort across the way actually lit up around 6:15 every nite and changed colors (green to blue to red to yellow-gray) which we thought was pretty cool!!! it resembles a pyramid and we would sit on our porch, drink some beers, cool off in our private cooling pool and listen to the tropical birds and animals over the fence (monkeys!)!!! The DO come spray some sort of bug spray out of some large fumigation device everynite around 8 or so- but we would hear them coming from far off, shut our door and just wait for them to go by- at least we were protected from malaria and it wasn't buggy at all at nite! hahaha Building 13 is a little further than we'd want to be but if we had a choice between 13 & building 3- we would pick 13 hands-down! Besides, as the check-in guy told us, buildings 8-13 are the newer buildings, have much bigger rooms and decks and the lower buildings do NOT have private cooling pools or flat screen plasma tv's in the bedroom (if tv matters to you- but since most stations are in spanish anyways- we didn't use ours). We found the pools VERY clean and despite the large amt. of people who stay at this resort, they weren't crowded at all- since they are so huge! Nice areas to actually \"walk on water\" to get from one pool to another, and raised areas in the center where you can lounge out, have drinks and talk to other travelers. The beach area, more specifically the water IS very rocky and not swimmable unless you bring water shoes. I never wear them but if i could go back, i would bring them next time- once you get past the coral reefs in the shallow areas, people were swimming past it (they had the shoes!). But the water is rougher there than other resorts we've stayed at- so you should be a strong swimmer. A lifeguard in tower is right on the beach- just in case. GREAT hammocks on the beach too! Like others have said, people would go to the pool at the crack of dawn and drape their towels, books etc over chairs- so as long as you get there no later than 9 am, you'll find a decent spot. It IS aggravating though to see reserved chairs sitting empty til after 11:30, while we had to get there early for ours. But since we tend to rise early on vacation anyways, it wasn't such a huge deal. Best beers- SOL (better than coronas!) and Leon (kinda like a sam adams)!!! The general store charges $11 a [-]-pack so stock up at walmart if possible. And as long as you buy cans, no one cares if you bring your own beers to and into the pool, no bottles allowed of course. We didn't eat in the restaurants there since not only were they expensive but we truly enjoy cooking. We picked up some mexican spices and mayos at the walmart along with chicken etc and made a lot ourselves- avocados, pineapple and watermelon are incredible there! But the roomservice menu seemed pretty affordable!!! We didn't use our room phone except to call the front desk, but we heard another guest complaining that even though she placed a call and hung up- she was charged a $3 usage fee per call. So get a calling card- CELL PHONES DO NOT WORK HERE. We have verizon service and could only receive incoming calls and texts, could NOT dial out or text out. GO TO COZUMEL! Especially chakanaab state park- snorkeling is well worth the $20 cab ride (10 each way) and $16 entrance fee to the park- spend the afternoon- fish and water are amazing! Lockers and bathrooms are there, along with chairs & of course the sm. bars/food areas. Snorkel and mask sets are only $5 to rent here if you don't own your own. Also a must- Carlos and Charlie's- best beef nachos we have ever had and of course, the SOL's are vital! Ferry ride to cozumel is out of playa del carmen and is $12 each way. We also did a day-trip/adventure tour with Alltournative tour company and they were incredible. our guide Elias was hysterical and knew how to get around and was very knowledgable- if you book a tour- request him! We did the mayan one in which we repelled, ziplined, kayakked to a location where we then swam in a sacred cavern, and ate a lunch prepared for us by the mayan natives. WELL WORTH THE $115 total. And don't bring your cameras- no need- or if you do- leave them in the van like we did. Way too much of a chance for loss/damage to them in the wild and there is a guy basically at every stop you make who takes action shots. We bought the disc at the end of the tour for $49- it was worth the peace of mind and we never would have gotten shots of ourselves kayakking or jumping into the underground pool anyways- money well spent. Also, buy something at the mayan \"store\" they take you to- 100% of the proceeds go to the village of 70 people who JUST got electricity last year.

The fire reports and several recent negative reviews made us all nervous. We had a very nice week at the Grand Mayan and would perhaps return again. But, in all fairness, I would say that many valid points were made by the majority of recent reviewers: 1) This place IS huge. If you don't want to walk, or can't- then the shuttles are your option. We did not find them particularly convenient. 2) This is not the place to come for a great beach experience- it is very pretty but rocky and rough- not a swimming or snorkeling spot. 3) If you want variety and alot of action, stay in Cancun or in Playa where you can easily find the type of entertainment or eating that you like. 4) Our accomodations were wonderful- building 4. However, we too found that many days we had no hand towels or wash cloths. The staff that worked our building were extremely friendly and accomodating but just seemed to consistently miss on a few things. The rooms were kept spotless! The marble floors are a concern- first from torrential rain that made entryways dangerous to simple spills or water in the bath areas. We did have several slip/falls or near misses in our group. 5) We too, found the restaurants limited. The food was average to marginal and there were often very long waits to get seated or served. Room service on the other hand was better quality and prepared food with exceptional service. Odd, but we had it a number of times. We did avoid the mexican buffet due to other reviewers concerns but really liked the Brio spa cafe and the (something) Moon although the service there was appalling slow at both breakfast and dinner. We are food people and found it inconvenient to taxi or shuttle out to Playa or other areas for a better selection of dining options (but remember, we didn't pick the place- we were guests of an owner). 6) Probably the worst thing for us was the check in, check out and airport shuttling. I believe alot of the problems stem from the Mayan Palace lobby trying to service this entire resort after the fire. It would tax any business.

We traveled to Nuevo in '07 and new what to expect with the room layout and service. We must have been spoiled in Nuevo because we were disapointed in the service and the way were were treated at Riveria Maya. We always purchase a week in the Grand Master Suite from a friend of ours who is an RCI owner and has always gotten the royal treatment. We were in building #3 and let me tell you - the reviews of fellow travelers are correct - I would suggest that you call EVERY day for a week before you get to the resort and have them put a note in your folio that you want to be in building 1-3. Otherwise, strap on your hiking boots as you will never get to the pool before noon. The resort is HUGE...but the trolly's they have to shuttle you around do work - but you need to be patient. Again, you are on Mexico time - thus everything works s..l...o...w..e...r. Frankly, if you have purchased a week from a wholesaler - good luck getting a good room - they are few and far between. Additionally, none of the rooms have ocean views based on how they were buildt after the hurricanes. So, if you are looking for an ocean view (like we always have in Nuervo) then forget it. When we arrived at the resort, we were taken to the Mayan Palace to check in as the Grand Mayan front lobby burned down in January! Apparently, this is the 2nd time in 6 months that this building has burned down. Also, they strapped \"Mayan Palace\" bracelets on us and we were at the Grand Mayan - we got stopped by security a couple of times as were were walking into the Grand Mayan - finaly after screaming at the front desk they \"magically\" had the Grand Mayan bracelets. Pool: If you want a Palapa - you have to be up early at the pool bar to stand in line. To rent the Palapa - the cost is $30 US - but if you spend $30 at the pool bar/restaurants - then you get the cost of the palapa back as a credit. (Make sure to check your bill upon check-out...surprise, surprise - the resort got our bill wrong multiple times) You can rent a palaya for two days and believe me - you want to do this. They fill up fast! I agree with all of the other reviews - I find it frustrating that folks get up early and stake their claim at the pool - only to not show up until after 11 AM. Good luck finding shade at the pool unless you have a palapa - so I would suggest you go early and often. Don't even bother trying to steal shade from the palapa - as the palapa comes with two chairs and most folks who rent the palapa will save up to 4+ chairs and tables for themselves. If you want a chair for the pool - go grab them from the beach - you will have better luck. The Grand Mayan pool is pathetic - but the Mayan Palace pool is amazing! The folks at the game area near the pool are wonderful - they have a ton of games you can check out. Happy hour is from 11-1 with 2 for 1 drinks. Frankly, the prices are fine - you get what you pay for...the drinks and service around the pool is great! Don't be shy about spending some money - you get what you pay for. Restaurants - Havana Moon is nice and we ate at Tratamo's one evening. We also had room service the first night we got to the resort and the service was fast and prompt. I would suggest that you go into Playa del Carmen and eat at Auja. Wonderful restaurant - we ate their 3 nights in a row! Excellent food - great price! Transportation: we had a party of 5 and we arranged for a private van (concierge booked this for us) to take us to and from Playa del Carmen each night. The cost was $78 round trip. (Make sure to get a firm price from the concierge BEFORE you leave the desk - they quoted us 4 different prices - what a shock...). Also, the concierge will charge this to your room - so you don't have to worry about cash - except for your tip for the driver. Otherwise, you could take a shuttle to Playa del Carmen fro $4 - but I would suggest taking a taxi - quicker and easier. The cost for a taxi is $20 US each way to and from Playa del Carmen. Wal-Mart/Mega: Playa del Carmen - I would suggest picking up some breakfast and munchies for your trip. We also purchased huge bottles of water as we always bring Nalgene bottles with us to the resort. Honest, given the size of the resort - it makes it difficult to go back and forth to your room during the day to eat lunch, etc. We always snacked at the pool. We did bring a suitcase full of food with us to the resort (snacks, coffee, fiters, etc). Beach: Beach is great - but you can't swim in the ocean - it is too rocky. There is a hut on the beach at the resort where you can rent jet-ski's, go diving, or go snorkeling. The cost was $46 US per person and COMPLETELY worth it. Some of the best snorkeling I have ever done. AND - the best part is that they charge the costs to your room. Housekeeping: Make sure to leave a buck or two on your pillows for the housekeeping staff and then at the end of your stay, your evening chambermaid will leave an envelope for you to tip them. They do a good job - remember - they probably make very little money each day...tip them well. Additionally, we had food left over so if you would like to give it to the housekeeping staff, you need to write a note saying they can take the food - otherwise - they cannot take it. Timeshare Speech: THINK ABOUT THIS CAREFULLY..is losing 4+ hours of your vacation really worth a 10% discount? They timeshare sales folks are HORRIBLE! They all follow the same pathetic timeshare sales techniques. They take you to breakfast, show you pictures of their kids and then try to sell you on the resort. We did the tour last year and wanted to buy at the Grand Mayan - but forget it...they want to suck you in at the Mayan Palace level and then try and get you to buy more by \"upgrading\". Finally, the sales folks are RUDE. They will say \"oh, you are taking food out of my children's mouth by not buying anything\" or \"you didn't just come on the tour for the discount did you?\". Save yourself the time - but a timeshare from the clearning houses on the web - you will pay 1/4 of what the GrandMayan folks are trying to overcharge you on. All-in-all, the resort was beautiful - but keep in mind...it is big.

The management is appalling, there was a major fire while I was there and nobody seemed to know what to do! I was told that the fire brigade were not allowed access as the hotel didn't want bad publicity, I don't know how true this is, but we were close to the first building that went up and it was very frightening. We also lost property which we were forced to abandon and the hotel refused to give us any compensation. A side from the fire - I would not recommend this resort to anyone. We were in building 11 which was near the golf course, this meant we had to get two buses to get to the rest of the resort. In the mornings and late afternoon these buses were so busy that we couldn't get on them, which meant standing in long queues or walking 40 minutes back to the room. We avoided eating at the resort in the evening as other than the buffet restaurant the service was terrible. We ate at the Havanna Moon one evening and regretted it- we arrived at 8pm, were seated at 9.15 and finally recieved our meals at 10pm. We had to get our own drinks from the bar as our waiter was too busy and when the meals did come the starter, and mains came together and were cold. This could be a nice resort if it was better managed and had more staff. The staff that they do have are friendly and try, but are overworked.

The weather was excellent for the week and the resort itself was immaculate, with a fantastic staff keeping the grounds and rooms to a very high standard; the best we have ever seen and we are avid world traveler's.

You simply have to sign for all your purchases against your room number which in my opinion makes your stay so much more convenient. We did the Premiere Chichen Itza tour and if you are lucky enough to get Victor as your tour guide, your day will be fantastic. We also did a catamaran/snorkling & Tulum tour that was good but they did not give much time to snorkel at the reef near Tulum was not that interesting. So you may want to spend your money elsewhere or just go to Tulum by bus. We went to Cozumel for a day and enjoyed some sightseeing. One word of advice; keep your money to shop in Playa del Carmen as Cozumel caters to the cruise crowd and most items are double or more in cost here, don't forget to barter in Playa. Transport is easy and we found it great to just shuttle or take a taxi once in a while verses the car rental idea. We did some shopping at Walmart for necessary items as did just about every other tourist. The prices were great and duty free alcohol is cheap there. We were suckers and went to the time share presentation but got attendance gifts of approx. $200.00 per couple( 10% off all resort purchases, $60.00 cash, and almost half off some of the tours) they were pushy but we were pro's at handling them and left after the mandatory 90 + min's were up. (Not recommended for the weak at heart) One point to note: They had an unfortunate fire at the Grand Mayan lobby the week before we arrived and are quickly rebuilding it, this didn't affect our stay as all services minus check-in are in another building. Overall, we will go back again and wish we could have stayed another week.

I will try to write this without it but it is hard because there were so many we spoke to about the fire when at the resort! We were at the Grand Mayan pool at 9 am on the morning of the fire. It ws a beautiful, peaceful morning with only a handful of people. The fire broke out quickly and spread very very fast-by the time we decided to leave we left running. Embers were flying in the air and the high winds that day contributed to the fire embers reaching across the pool we were at and setting building 7 on fire! We had charcol embers on our skin once we got to our lobby! I will attest to the smoke and very large flames and how dreadful this was for us. the worst part is how quickly life can go from utter relaxation to running for your life. That is not an exageration as there was a great deal of damage and destruction done to the Grand Mayan chairs etc. If we had hung around it would not have been good! The even worst part was staff and managements support following the fire. We lost things at the pool with smoke damage, fire damage and not finding them again. No compensation! No one called us to see if we were okay-seeing we were a handful of people by the pool and they knew who we were. Other issues-our patio door in our bedroom behind a curtain was unlocked everyday after we got back from the pool. There were questionable individuals milling about the back of the Grand Mayan property and we even had items taken from our patio. The kids club is only as good as the staff and the day-some days they wer bang on other days they stood around and made lists for people as to whom we should name in the hotel review! It is now two shuttles to restaurants-about a good 20 minutes to half and hour ride-makes it hard after a long day and a long dinner. Restaurants service was poor, and the restaurant food was okay. The pool service was outstanding and these folks work very hard and are eager to please.

We were very pleasantly surprised and had a very nice stay. We took the shuttle to the hotel which we arranged prior to our stay and it went smoothly. Check in was very quick. We were asked if we were interested in their tour and promotion which we declined. We got one call later in the week to see if we changed our minds. We again declined and no one bothered us further about this. I did hear from people who took the tour that it was a very unpleasant and time consuming experience, even for people who liked the property and eventually ended up buying in. We asked for a room close to the pool, but were told it was not available, and instead were put in bldg 12 which is about as far away as you can get from the pool and beach. The room was a 2 bedroom suite which was one of the nicest rooms we had ever stayed out. Since my wife and I like to walk, walking everywhere was not a problem. It is maybe 20 minutes to everything at the most. We never took the shuttle, but from what I could see, they did seem to run frequently. The only down side I could see is that if you wanted to, it was not easy to go back and forth to your room from the pool, but that was not an issue for us. The pluses of the property are the grounds are beautiful, the pools were very nice and the staff was friendly and accommodating. Since you are isolated, you do eat most of the time at the properties restaurants. The food was good and the meals while not cheap, were not outrageous either. We had a kitchen so we had all our breakfasts in the room. We also went to Playa del Carmen which was worthwhile seeing and eating at and got supplies at Walmart. You can reserve a shuttle to take you there the day before for $4/person. We went snorkeling and diving via the travel agency and while not cheap, again was not outrageous and the staff were excellent. We took the shuttle back to the airport which worked out fine. Check out is at 10 am, but you can stay and use the facilities, charging things directly to your credit card. We also found out that you can reserve a courtesy room for free to shower and change in before going to the airport. From our perspective, the only downside which would be why we would not go back is the fact that you can not use the beach because of the rocks although there is a real nice beach a short distance south of the resort within easy walking distance which is beautiful and where you can swim. We also did not like the fact that the resort is so isolated.", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vernon, B.C.", "Title": "\u201cTimeshare Sales Presentation goes on even when the resort is on Fire!\u201d", "Author": "B.C.Heather", "ReviewID": "UR13459545", "Content": "Just back from a 2 week stay at the Grand Mayan. We were in a one bedroom suite and the room we had couldn't have been better. Building 1 , room 3422. Third floor, view over the lagoon and you could see the ocean from our deck. After reading many reviews myself the opinion you have of this resort can really be determined from where you are put. Building 1, 2, 6. and 7 would be your best bet, 1 & 2 closest to the pools and the lobby (except that it was destroyed during the fire) and building 6 & 7 are close to the ocean and pools. If you are sent to 8-13 I personally would have really not been happy. The resort is very large, and the shuttles are there to take you places but you are always waiting for one. One will pick you up at your building and take you to the lobby and then you wait for another one to take you to the pool. There is alot of waiting. I too love to walk the grounds in the early morning but by mid afternoon in the heat it is not that much fun walking of waiting for shuttles. For the Mayan place guests they go all the way back to building 21 and as another guest told me it was like staying in another country! What is missing for the comfort of the guests at this resort is no restaurants or pools at the back of the property for the guests in the far buildings. We stayed at the Royal Decameron last year in PV and although there were 6 buildings very spread out and some far from the ocean, there was a pool and bar close to all buildings if you didn't want to walk to the main pools and ocean. Much nicer for seniors or families with children. We were there for the fire and had some real concerns with some of the safety proceedures. First let me say that I have read some reviews that did down play the fire, but for some of us that were seperated from our families ( I left my daughter and husband sleeping in the room with the balcony door open that was directly under the roof palapa on building one which was the first building by the outbreak of the fire) I could not tell if our building was on fire from the beach area as the smoke was too thick. I was more worried about smoke inhalation if they did not wake up and pictured our room full of smoke and them not waking up. It was very, very scary. A housekeeper pounded on the doors and told guest to get out and evacuate thru other buildings. We did not connect for a few hours after the fire and I hope I never haver to experience something like that again. The fire alarms in our building never went off!!?? The staff did a good job of getting the fire out and within a few days things were pretty well back to normal. The Grand Lobby was destroyed, the new Grand pool area that had just opened was destroyed and the palapa roof on building 7 was destroyed. The management never gave any information or response to the fire and pretended nothing had happened. Upon check out I found out that the lobby records were destroyed, as they needed my credit card imprint again. From what I understand nobody was hurt and that was the main thing. I think what bothered me the most during the fire was seeing the timeshare sales people continuing on like it was just another day. And the people were following them!! What kind of people are they? Some of us had no idea if our families were safe or if anyone was injured. This was the lowest, most disgusting thing I have ever witnessed. The shuttle service is really nice, for $4.00 you can get a return ticket to Playa. It is a popular service and most times you have to book a day in advance although sometimes you can get lucky on the same day. Cab ride to Playa is $20.00 each way. We also went to Puero Morelos a few times for dinner and the cab was about $15.00 each way. We usually ate at Havana Moon food is average to good. The Del lago buffet is so overpriced at $22.00 for breakfast and $30.00 for dinner which only includes water and coffee for beverages, that we paid $30.00 cab fare to Pureto Morelos to leave our money in there great restaraunts. Try L'oazis if you go there, it is fantastic. Had room service a few times and the service is fantastic, the staff is really great. The resort is overpriced for food and beverage service, the happy hours help some. I don't expect to buy things at a 5 star resort cheap but I don't expect them to gouge a captive audience. Most drinks are $6.00 , wine is $8.00 a glass, some drinks eg mud slides are $8.50 a drink and in my opinion that is overpriced. The palapa beds are nice to have for the day. You must go down to the pool snack bar at 7:15 am (they start lining up at 6:45) to reserve one at $30.00 for the day. You will get a credit for the $30.00 if you spend that in food and drinks at the pool bar or restaraunt and that is easy to do with a few drinks and lunch. You will not get your credit until check out and you have to ask they will not take it off automatically. Keep your receipts. The internet cafe was hit and miss for us. It was down for 2 days due to the fire. If you have your own wireless laptop you can use it, but they can only hook up 8 IPaddresses at one time so you may have to wait if they have alot of people at the same time. Cost is $4.00 for 30 min or $7.00 for 1 hour. Beautiful sandy beach but getting in the water is almost impossible due to rocks. I can't say enough good things about the front bell boys and lobby greeters, they are all just great with helping take things to your room etc. If you are booked here, you will have a good time. It is just that lots of things could be improved. The pools are fabulous and opened 24 hours , I have never seen that before. They are extremely warm as well. The gym and spa area are first class. Try the Brio snack shop above the gym a quiet area to look at the ocean and have a fresh made smoothie. I personally would not return here as I don't think it is anywhere as nice as Nuevo Vallarta, except for that turquoise sea. Also I have read many reviews about a lazy river being constructed on this property and that is false. The new Grand pool area that opened and then burn't down had no lazy river and there is not one being built.", "Date": "February 11, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dublin, Ireland", "Title": "\u201cSteer Well Clear\u201d", "Author": "bigdubguy", "ReviewID": "UR13236244", "Content": "We honeymooned at the Grand Mayan last september, we booked it through RCI and were all excited since the RCI rep told us how hard it is to holiday there. all i can say is it was two weeks of my life i'll never get back!!!!! we were a bit shocked to see that our 1 bedroom timeshare only traded for a studio in the Mayan but that we didn't really mind, that was untill we discovered that all that seperated us from the (noisy) family next door was a timber door. so it started that we were up at 6.30am when the young baby next door was up crying or screaming, parents shouting, furniture being dragged all around the apt. the worst was if we could hear them thay could hear us if your catching my drift. no tea coffee making facilities in a studio so had to be ordered through roomservice $12 a pop for a tea and a coffee. you dont see that adding up after 14 days maybe 2 or 3 times a day, i love my tea!! huge complex but nothing happening in the evening, too far and costly to travel to playa every night, restaurants extremely expensive, everything else too, the prices of swimsuits in the boutique had to be seen to be believed, same for food in small food shop, excuse was it has to be imported but cheaper anywhere else outside the complex. $6 an ice cream!! nice for a few days then cabin fever sets in, really ruined our honeymoon. came home and had to have a weekend break in Paris and a few days in Sweden to make up for it. so if your planning a hooneymoon or looking to enjoy a holiday steer clear!!", "Date": "February 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cStay Away\u201d", "Author": "auntjudy325", "ReviewID": "UR13110334", "Content": "Never Again.

In hindsight I would NOT have planned a vacation at the Grand Mayan in Riviera Maya, Mexico. I stayed at the resort on a RCI exchange and I was thrilled to get in. That was until we got there\u2026.. 1.We were met at the airport by a bus that would hold 10 people if the people were midgets. They stuffed 10 people in but it was a major safety issue. 2.Upon arriving at the resort we were told to stand in line to check in. Then we noticed that the people at the end of the line went up to the check in desk before the 10 people on line. When we complained the \u201cmanager\u201d said that the line was backwards and should have started from the rear end. I don\u2019t know if she was drinking tequila for breakfast, but please tell me when did the end of a line go first? 3.They took so many forms of id and so many signatures you would think we were on a work release from prison instead of their guests 4.They assigned us to building 12 which was almost at the end of Grand Mayan property. They saw we were all seniors but they didn\u2019t care and this lack of caring really ruined our vacation. 5.The shuttle buses came every half hour and if you missed it you had to walk. When I say walk I mean to everything, the pools, the beach, the lobby, the restaurants and the activities desk. I am not talking about a short stroll; I am talking about miles each way for people who ranged in age from 76-61. We decided the walking was for the birds but we were captive and had no other choice sometimes. We never did eat in any of their restaurants for dinner. Who felt like venturing out knowing the hassle to find food and drink? You could figure at least 40 minutes each way to the restaurants and after a day in the heat none of us wanted to do it. Instead we ordered room service for 6 of the 7 nights we were there. Room service was handled exceptionally well and we enjoyed it a lot. The prices being the same as the restaurants we decided never to go to one. The only night we ate out was the night we went to Playa del Carmen and we loved it. 6.We took an excursion to Isla Mujeres one day. It was a long but nice day. The tour bus picked us up at 8:45 for a 8 am scheduled time. We arrived in Cancun in 40 minutes and in another 40 we were sailing to the Island. I highly recommend this trip. It is only $60 a person with transportation to the boat, small continental breakfast, unlimited drinks, chairs, lunch buffet, and entertainment on the boat. The problem arouse on our arrival back on property. The bus driver was only given access to the Mayan Palace and not the Grand Mayan. We were summarily dropped off to find our own way back to our rooms. Our friends flagged down a golf cart which was wonderful since we were exhausted and had missed the last bus back to our villa a mile down the road. 7.The pool was very, very big but by the time we schlepped there on the busses all the shade was gone. On our last morning I went down at 7:30 and all the palabas were already gone. We had to search for shade and actually \"borrowed\" shade from someone\u2019s palaba and sat in the walkway aisle of the pool. 8.Check-out was a nightmare. We got on the bus to leave but we were thrown off because we hadn\u2019t gone to the main lobby to checkout. They had our credit cards but they insisted we make the trek to the lobby to sign out. Because we hadn\u2019t done the physical check out they wouldn\u2019t let us on their transportation, which we had paid for before leaving home. It was the closest I ever felt to be imprisoned. We took the third bus out since we were thrown off the first and the second was full but once at the airport we actually relished the hours spent there eating lunch and shopping at our leisure. We were free at last!! This would be a wonderful resort if you are in building 1-3 of the Grand Mayan. Then you could use the pools and eat at the restaurants. My friends really missed eating out at night and I felt sorry for them. We did have two breakfasts at the Havanna Moon but that's all.

Immediately upon registering, we were approached by a Grupo Mayan sales rep and upgraded to the Grand Mayan Resort. The suite was beautiful to look at. The beds are the hardest mattresses and pillows we have ever encountered (the same can be said of the sofas). There was a very nice kitchen which we used daily for breakfast, but the kitchens do not have ovens, only stovetops. The Mayan Palace stovetops only have 2 burners, the \"Grand\" kitchens have 4. For food purchases, we drove into Playa Del Carmen and shopped at the WalMart - although there are other groceries around as well. Be PREPARED!! This resort has some of the most aggressive time share sales reps any of us have ever encountered. Yes, all 4 of us did attend the 90 minute sales presentation (free breakfast, $60 US per person room credit, and 10% off all room charges), which they turned into a 4 hour saga. We kept trying to leave, they would send over another sales \"manager\" - they sent over a total of 4. We just \"had to buy - it's Marketing Week\". We met a great ex-sales rep at a bar who said that every week is \"Marketing Week\" at Grupo Mayan, and we all believe that. The entire presentation made the organization appear desperate and frankly, shady. The fact is, we all LOVE the region, and we actually purchased a much better and longer timeshare later in the week for much less money...at Sandoz Resorts in Playacar. As to the resort...it is enormous and so spread out that it would be very difficult for families w/ small children, or people w/ physical difficulties to get around. There are shuttles, but you have to wait 20 min. for the next one. The pool is also enormous, which is good because you cannot swim at the beach as it is all rock ledge and treacherously slippery. The restaurants we ate at (Balchi and Havana Blue) were both quite good. The prices were comparable to a nice US resort. One member of our party ordered room service and received a wonderful meal in perfect order. She was so impressed that she phoned the room service number to praise them. Every staff member was gracious and extremely helpful. If you have a car, take a roadtrip up to Puerto Morelos...just south of Cancun. It is a glorious fishing village w/ a town square on the ocean, surrounded by little shops and cafes. We had drinks at Pelicans...loved it. I am certain the village will be bought up by developers and become Resort Row in the next few years, so go now! We also went to Isla Mujeres. If you go, be certain to take a golf cart drive around the island - very enjoyable! In Playa Del Carmen, go to La Parrilla restaurant on 5th Ave at 8th St. The XL Gold Margaritas are wonderful, as was every meal we had there ( we went twice, we loved it so much!).

We stayed at this fantastic resort 12/23 - 12/30/07 and had a wonderful Christmas and experience. We rented a car, which I highly recommend! We used a friends RCI timeshare week and we requested a building 1 - 6 when we made the reservation. We arrived around 5:00 and check in was a breeze and our room was in building 4 which was in primo location to everything, .....Angel the bell boy was awesome and spoke English very well and explained everything in our beautiful 2 bedroom room with a well equipped kitchen (except measuring cups). Christmas Eve we went to Walmart (what a experience compared to the US, especially the liquor isle and the price of the tequila ;-))!! I do suggest if you drink Margaritas to buy some tequila in the Duty Free Airport Hornitos buy 2 bottles get 1 free $40.00 and some margarita mix great deal! They have NO mix in the store at the resort! We had breakfast in our room and a few dinners. We went snorkeling in Cozumel and paid $10 for parking and paid $100.00 for a glass bottom boat tour that included the gear, 3 different drops, and lots of corona and drinks for the kids, it was around 3+ hours and lots of fun! Because of our gold band this was sold to us by a Mayan Palace Represenative over by Senor Frogs in Playa Del Carmen. Do negotiate, and don't be dissapointed by the glass bottom boat ;-)! We went to Xel-Ha and we had a flyer that had in the right hand corner a pink circle that said $59 or $69 all-inclusive per person, so we took that to the park and they honored that there at the park. Great day for the price, snorkeling was good except there is not a lot of fish until you get closer to the bridge. The kids had a great day! We spent a day at Akumal.....took another glass bottom boat and snorkeled with sea turtles which was awesome...and sweet! Dont take a boat just swim out with snorkel gear and you will do the same thing except save $70.00...we felt ripped off...the ONLY time our whole trip. The restaurant to the right is very good when you walk in from the little town. For snorkeling Cozumel was the BEST!! We have been to lots of places in Mexico and by far the Mayan Riviera area is our favorite and the Grand Mayan resort is our favorite. My husband and I would definately buy into this palace....however we had no pressure what so ever from anybody at this resort. All we had was great service, great food, great entertainment, great fun......bottom line a place that makes it hard to want to come home! These reviews were 100% helpful for our vacation....and all I can say is I don't understand the negative reviews! P.S. Watch out for the speed bumps! and the mesquitos at nite! P.S.S.

We were there from Dec. 16 to the 23rd and the weather was picture perfect. We did a time share exchange and they gave us a two bedroom suite so we brought along one adult daughter. The only downside is that there is not much doing for singles. However, they are building a disco/lounge so the young single adults will have where to hang out at night. The rooms were huge and spacious and the accommodations were wonderful. Service was excellent although sometimes their timing was different. But our room was cleaned everyday and we had turn down service with chocolates every night. We thought the restaurants were great, especially if you don't eat Mexican food which was the case for one member of our party. However, he loved the pizza at Havana Moon along with their salad with grilled vegetables. The food there was reasonable and good. Tramonto which is their finer restaurant was excellent. Entrees ranged from $12 to $25. Pretty much the same as a good restaurant at home. However the service and rolls were wonderful! They had the best Minnestone Soup and the bowl was big enough to be a meal with the rolls. We did not rent a car because it was so expensive during this time period. However, they provide a shuttle service to Playa del Carmen and Cancun. We went to Playa for $4 round trip per person. Very reasonable!!! We booked our tours through the travel agency on the grounds at the discounted price. I would highly recommend the snorkeling tour at Puerto Morelos. They provide equipment if you need it, take you on a boat to two different reefs and then all you can eat and drink for lunch for $51. The guides and attendants were all wonderful and helped you to make the most of the adventure! We found plenty to do on the grounds and at the pools. Others have said it is not a party place and I would agree. But it is very relaxing with beautiful grounds to walk around and friendly, helpful service everywhere. We shopped for groceries at the store there. We would stop on our way back after dinner to pick up what we might need for the next day. We didn't cook, but breakfast and some lunches were great in the room. I loved sitting out on the patio with my coffee in the morning and watch the birds and wildlife in the area. If you get a chance, go to the drink lessons they offer at the Grand Mayan pool area. Salvatore is hysterical and you can drink yourself silly for free!!!!!! We did the time share presentation for the discounts, but because we fell in love with the resort, traded our time share in for this one. You have to negotiate, but there are good deals to be had. You also have the advantage of using any of the Mayan resorts and that was more appealing as well. Philosophically, they believe in an eco environment and that works well for us. We would go back in a heart beat. I think I would like to rent a car to do some more exploring, but they do drive a bit crazy there. It was like a tropical paradise on the grounds. They are still building and adding a lazy river and an indoor pool. The beach is great for sitting on, although it is rather rocky. Not great for swimming at this point, but they say they are working on that as well. We went to relax and enjoy the warm weather and that is exactly what we did.

First, rent a car at the airport. Driving is relatively easy and having the car affords you a great deal of freedom and saves money in the long run. We used thrifty and althought the car was advertised for 160, it was double that with required insurances and taxes. That was with declining two other optional insurances. Again, the car paid for itself! When we arrived the at the GM the rooms were not ready, however they did offer us lunch at a discount and facilities to change and store luggage. Our room turned out to be wonderful and very large. We had the 2bedroom suite and had more than enough room. As has been stated the resort in huge and getting from place to place is on foot, which can take some time. We were in building 8 which was a good 20 min. walk to the pool, internet, gym, spa and store. The staff is all very nice. The time share or as they call it \"vacation club\" presentation is grueling. It starts 7 x's higher than their finale offer and changes often. Be very careful. The food in the resort is average. Not horrible and not great. We ate breakfast in our room and ate in Playa most nights were we got some great deals for our money and some wonderful Mexican food. We drove to Xcaret and spent the day. We could not do half the activities in the park in one day. We drove to Cancun one evening for dinner and shopping and Tulum to tour the ruins. This is very hot, even though it is right on the ocean. We went to Cozmel on the ferry and did a snorkel trip on the Manta, which was very nice and reasonable. Next, time I would plan to spend a few days in Cozmel. We did do to Walmart to stock up but found a local supermarket with better prices and selection.

Be smart ...be safe. OK...that was my only negative....breakfast buffett expensive...but worth the splurge...Mexican dishes and your standard \"BIG\" American breakfast. Ordered roomservice one day....fantastic service and not expensive. You can also have breakfast at Havana Moon...outside facing the ocean if you get there early enough...(only a few tables).

Pelos) was fantastic and we booked him through Carey Deep Scuba (See, [--]) will use them for many years to come. Loved shoping in Puerto Morelas.

The worst moment of our stay was also the first moment of our stay. Upon arrival at Cancun airport we purchased a $75 cab with Grayline taxi's to the hotel. Grayline is the only carrier available. Rather then taking us to the taxi, we were taken to a man who was trying to get us to attend a timeshare seminar. I had to almost threaten him, to get him to direct us to the actual taxi. Upon arrival at the hotel, I noticed the security guard scowling at our driver. After a short exchange he ordered him to pull into the round about at which time, we were told to exit the taxi without a word of explanation. We literally were sitting there at the entrance of the property, on the side of the road, in the hot sun, just off of the plane. After 5 minutes of being ignored, one of the guards said that the taxi driver would not take us to the lobby. This was a lie. In actuality the Grand Mayan is in dispute with Grayline and will not allow its' taxi's on site. Since Grayline is the exclusive company servicing the airport, all passengers are forced to disembark, wait for a bus to be taken to the lobby to check in. How a taxi service can get away with steering customers toward time shares and a hotel, can force her guests to be put out on the street is beyond comprehension to me. Needless to say I was eager to share my displeasure with our treatment with the front desk attendant. She was nice though not surprised, nor concerned with trying to repair the damage. When her supervisor came over to assist her with finding a room, (it wasn't ready) I iasked that she explain to her boss the information about the incident. The manager apologized and offered us lunch on them, without alcholic beverages, and a later check-out,( meaning instead of having to vacate the room at 10AM we could stay until 12, without having to pay the $295 US penality.) To top it off, when the room was finally ready, we found it not to be in the buildings which were nearer to the pool areas, but in the furtherest building away. After reading posts here we called ahead to be sure to get a room in the closer buildings and were assured that we would, yet, here we were taking the golf cart far, far and away. When I saw how far we were going I asked the driver to take us back to the lobby, since I was certain this was an error. Nope...that's all they had left. And away we went again. So all total it probably took us two and half hours to get into our room for vacation. Not a good start. Thankfully, things went much better from there. The room is wonderful, no view, but that seems standard for all of the resorts in this area. The accomodations were contemporary. I was really surprised by the level of finish in the room, as well as the rest of the resort, including the gym, spa, and restaurants. The pool is great especially if you know the secret. The key to a wonderful poolside experience is the cabana's. For $33 US you get your own cabana all day with two sun chairs. So you have the best of both worlds, the bed for reading and sleeping, and the chairs for sunning. What's more, $30 of the $33 is given to you as a food and beverage credit. Of course you were gonna spend at least that amount anyway, so the cabana is like free. You should try to get there early so you can reserve the best ones, like away from the noises of the kiddie pool, hotel sponsored drinking games, and water aerobics. Our regular routine was to head to the gym by 8AM reserviing our cabana on the way. Workout and then grab breakfast at the restaurant next door which overlooks the ocean. Return to the room and change. We would come back to the pool, and slide into our cabana just in time to catch the opening bell of happy hour. The rest of the day was filled with reading, sleeping, some volley ball on the beach, or a quick trip to the internet cafe. We did this every day, and it never got old. Over all, the resort is lovely, if not for the whole shuttle scenario. Admittedly, we never waited more then a few minutes for a ride. The staff is friendly and helpful, and of course the weather is to die for. The shows are a little chessy. We caught one that may have been intended as an homage to various cultures, but turned out to be more like worldwide tour of cultural stereotypes reinforced with music, dance, costumes, and make-up. But no big deal...No Politically Correct Police in Mexico!!! I would recommend this place but only with sober expectations that something or other may occur to remind you that this \"ain't the Ritz,\" but still a nice place and a nice value. Cheers PS...unless you're feeding a large family, save the money on the cab ride to Walmart and just hit the sundries shop..>Sure it's more pricey, but hey, you're saving on the cab.

Before we went I read at least 30 reviews and it really helped. It is definitly a place to relax and enjoy a pieceful vacation. If you are looking for lots of nightlife and shopping, the Grand Mayan makes that a little bit difficult unless money is no object. My concern was the location, I know Playa very well and wondered how easy it would be to get there. If you don't care to spend each way about $ 20 for a taxi it's not a problem. We tried to take the bus a few times, but as of right now, you do have to cross a huge highway with lots of traffic, then there is no bus stop yet, so you just stand there and at night it's totally dark and hope for a bus to stop. We found out that if a bus is full, it won't stop. The 2 times we tried it, each time a taxi stopped and told us, they would take us to town for $ 3 each, the bus is $ 1.80 each, that was reasonable and a lot easier. I heard from others, who took the bus it took at least 35 - 40 minutes to get there, it stopped every few minutes unless you were lucky to get on the \"express\", with the taxi it took almost 30 Min in, coming back about 20. I have not found anybody who rode the bus in and out, it is quite complicated coming back, they all took taxis, which can get expensive. The food at the hotel restaurants is pretty expensive, for instance $ 5.00 for french fries, $ 8.00 for a hamburger etc just as an example. We still had a great time, we went to Walmart and bought most of our groceries to fix breakfast and lunch, sometimes even dinner and just had desert or snacks at the restaurants there. I guess it depends on what you want, this time we enjoyed the relaxing and layed back time, the rooms were great, the staff esp the entertainment groups were fantastic, they had life music at some of the restaurants until about 10.00 PM.

I tried to write a quick review but it is ending up to be way too long because I am such a detail oriented person. So if you are interested in reading it please email me at [-]and I will forward you my MS Word document of my observations and itinerary of our trip. Please make sure to put Grand Mayan in the subject line so that I know it is not junk email. We stayed at the Grand Mayan October 14-21st, 2007. (We were concerned at first because it is rainy season and hurricane season. Rain never affected us. If it rained, it would rain for 5 minutes and be gone.) I traveled with my husband and another couple. We are all in the age range of 37 years young! My husband and I like to be outdoors and therefore do outdoor activities. A quick itinerary of our schedule included trips to Tulum, Peurto Muerolos, Playa del Carmen, Cozumel, Isla Mujeres and Akumal. So if you are thinking of going to any of these places, please email me for details. I will say our favorite food was in Peurto Muerolos at Hotel Pasada. Our favorite snorkeling was in Akumal. And our favorite island is Isla Mujeres. 7 days was not near long enough!

The only other negative is that if you plan on doing any laundry (they do provide washers and dryers on each floor) it will cost you $8.00 USD per load. Yes you read that correctly, $8.00 and then you can only do laundry between the hours of 8:00am to 5:00pm.

We were able to get one of the Collectivos that come literally every 10-15 minutes outside of the hotel. I loved Avendia Cinco & its various resturants. I just disliked all the hawking some of the vendors engaged in. We were able to get the majority of our souvenior shopping done while there. The beach @ PDC was gorgeous!

It was a great decision!!! When we arrived and saw how spread out it was and that the residential units were not on or facing the ocean, my first impression was concern for the quality of our trip. WRONG! Once we got into the lay of the land and determined that being in the Grand Mayan buildings we were pretty close to the parking lot, the administrative building (front desk), the restaurants, bars and the awesome pool, we were more then happy with the resort. The ocean is not the center of attention here, though it is there if you want to use it and has a nice beach. We don't normally do a laid back vacation as we tend to be explore the area we are staying in more then sitting at pool side. However, on this trip, we did a lot of relaxing...in the suite, in the patio dipping pool, in the pool, along side the pool in the cabanas and taking scuba dives. We spent a fair amount of time have cold drinks in the various bars and found the Havan Moon a delight along with the Wine Bar and the Italian restraunant. Then there was the open air buffett overlooking the lagoon. Great entertainment and very good food. We also had entertainment in the Havan Moon restraunant. The service was exceptional through out the resort! Our room maids worked their hard to provide us a clean and spotless quarters through out our stay. They turned the beds down at night and changed the linens daily. If you go, tip them well as they make very little and they do appreciate a tip for their week of hard work. We took a boat trip to Cozumel - fun and easy. We didn't dive in Cozomel and I hear we should have done so. Certainly we enjoyed diving right at the resort with Ross and Manuel as our dive masters. Sergio - good, but was far more interested in the young ladies then in us. Overall...it is a five star experience. The grounds were stunning and the pool awesome. The food and drinks were fairly priced and the result was the most relaxing trip I have taken in years. The towns of Cancun and Playa Del Carmen or tipical Mexican towns. Overall, worth one trip to see and shop, but not my cup of tea. I would recommend the Grand Mayan. I would request building 3, 4, 5 or 6 on the lagoon side and 2nd or 3rd floor. Building 1 & 2 catch the afternoon sun and would seem to be a little hot. Building 7 would be okay, closest to the pool and bars, but further from the front desk and parking lot.

Adventure, city life, exercise, pampering, family, romantic budget etc..?? We are Grand Mayan members. This resort is 5 star, exclusive, secluded get away from your busy every day life. The focus is around the pool which is amazing in addition to customer service. If you're looking for a budget vacation, swimmers beach - this isn't it. The beach is absolutely stunning but not for swimming due to the rocky bottom. The resort is large- and if you're not prepared to walk a little bit and enjoy the feeling that you're in a small village, instead of a small hotel where you walk out the door and you're in the middle of everything - you just need to prepare yourself for a little walking. Pros: Drinkable water on the resort. Remember - you don't want to order a drink outside the resort that has ICE in it. In the resort- you're all good. Frozen drinks at the 24 hour pool is completely safe. More than friendly staff who is impressed by your efforts to speak their language. Activities throughout the day for kids, adults and more including bar games, salsa dancing, outdoor movie watching, contests, aquatic volleyball, beach stretching, yoga and these are all free. Food is wonderful especially in Balache/Frida restaurant near the pool. Recommend breakfast at newly built Havana Moon (overlooking the ocean) and dinners at any of the others. Rooms are immaculate, maids service, night turn down service, resort landscaping, fresh flowers, trees on the croc reserve. Virtually no bugs- people don't notice this until they leave the resort that you don't get eaten alive. Pool was so large that if you wanted to be involved in activies you can sit in one section but if you wanted some privacy you can get that too whether you lay on a private bed or standard beach chair. Transportation system is very effective (roads throughout the resort to get you to where you want to go if you don't want to walk) The landscaping is beautiful and hasn't been mentioned in many reviews. The air smells great, the trees are lush, areas are clean and safe. Playa del Carmen is only $1.50 bus ride (one way) right outside the front gate of the resort (or $20 cab ride for those that complain it's too far away from everything). You can be there in about 20 minutes. You can check out the beaches in Playa but be preapred to pay for all beach access unless you sit on the sand. Cons: Timeshare sales presentations are very high pressure. 90 minutes=3 hours and that is if you don't buy. You have to ask yourself if the incentive of $100 and 10% off entire room bill is worth 3 frustrating hours of your time. That experience certainly doesn't represent the rest of the stay - it's the just the \"presentation\" time. Very high pressure, pushy. Non swimmers beach - but just like anywhere else- GET OUT OF THE RESORT and go sighseeing. Tulum beaches were breathtaking. 1.5 hrs south Not a budget vacation. Minimize costs by grabbing some snacks and renting a room with a kitchen if you want to cut down costs- especially if you are travelling with more than 2 people. No Internet access in the rooms although you can go to cibercafe on the resort to connect for $7 an hour. You can find cheaper connections outside but you're not there to be on the Internet - you're there for VACATION! Strong Recommendations: Don't rent a car for a week - but do rent a car for your sight seeing instead of going on tours if you don't want to be with a group of people. Hire a tour guide once you're where you want to be (Coba, Tulum, Chichen Itza). They make it so easy - bring the car right to the resort for you. Be careful of anyone trying to offer you something for free or such a low price- usually they want you to sit through a \"presentation\" at another resort. The BEST way to get ideas on what to do and where to go is the ASK the locals.

I booked this resort sight unseen through a timeshare exchange thru RCI. I called RCI last April and requested a Mexican or carribean resort for the above dates. The CSR told me he could get the Grand Mayan and told me it was a great resort. In fact, I was told that I could only get the Grand Mayan through a timeshare exchange every three years. This is a cashless resort. Everything is put on a tab with a mandatory 15% tip included. This applies to stuff you buy at the resort store, internet access, laundry....everything has a 15% charge added on. A bummer for us is that we needed a lot of internet time and they had no inroom internet access. Internet time is $7 and hour or $4 for half an hour at their internet room....plus the 15%. The resort itself is ouside of Cancun. We rented a car and I suggest you consider the same if you want to do any activities outside the resort. From reading previous reviews, I was expecting much higher food costs. We ate at the pool cafe several times for lunch and dinner and the tab was 25 to 45 bucks for two people. Wood fired pizza for 12 bucks. We drove to Playa del Carmen several nights for dinner and there are so many good places to eat and shop there. Forget swimming in the ocean at this resort. The beach is nice and there are lounges and palapas to use. The pools are fantastic. Lots of room and lots of lounges and palapas. The grounds are immaculate. The greenery in good shape. The staff is friendly and helpful. The spa is very nice. Had a reflexolgy massage. The gym has first rate eqiupment. The resort has a \"travel\" department which will gladly arrange any number of different tours for you. If you are budget minded, or you like flexibility, I strongly suggest you arrange and drive to the tour spots yourself. Here is an example: For a \"discounted\" tour to Xel Ha and Tulem, arranged by the tour company the cost is $90.00. You can get into Xel-Ha for $59 and Tulem for $5...and be on your own schedule. The tour only allows for 4 to 5 hours at Xel-Ha and you will not be able to enjoy your expereince there in such a short time. Also, the Xel-Ha expereince is the best value I had in Mexico. All the food and drink (including alcohol) snorkling equipment, towels, lockers for $59. Also remember, when you book a tour through the resort, you pay an additional 15% over the quoted costs for the tip. To get \"discounted\" tours through the resort you must submit to a timeshare presentation. For enduring the presentation, you get a breakfast $100 resort credit and an additional 10% off of you resort tab. I own a timeshare (which I bought off ebay). We have been to four different timeshare presentations at different resorts and this was the most grinding and grueling expereince we have ever had. The saleslady actually looked hurt and offended when I would't buy 2 weeks a year at the 2 bedroom unit for $79,000. The sales staff try and tell you that you can rent half of your units and actually make money....however I know from experience that units don't always rent out. We had to talk to 8 different people and tell each one that we weren't interested. They kept throwing in better deals. One of the last deals was a free carribean cruise with 1500 airfare allowance plus something like 8 weeks to use over 8 years plus and additional 8 weeks at other resorts for 199.00 per week. RCI offer these all of the time for members. ...called Last Call Vacations. The cost of this was about 4 to 5 grand as I recall. The very last deal was for 2000.00 For that you get a free week at a Mayan resort plus three more weeks to use. Keep in mind you still must pay the maintinence fee which were about $650....and some type of exchange fee. They seemed desperate to make a sale. Offered more days at the resort, offered dinners, tickets to tours, spa treatments. I just didn't want to spend any money and the finally let us go. There is a par three Nicholas designed golf course on the premise. The course was in great shape. Alligators in the water hazards. I saw 4 other golfers and about 20 different workers while on the course. (if you are going to golf here, bring a lot of balls...lots of water!) We stayed at the Grand Mayan which is a step up from the Mayan Palace...however, both are nice. Our room had a seperate tub and shower, a balcony, fridge, stove, microwave, dishes and silverware. There was a little plungepool on the balcony for cooling off. As mentioned in other posts, this reosrt is huge. When we checked in I tried the $20 front desk tipping technique ( see [--] for info on this). I asked for a room close to the pool. The clerk gave us building 2, which is the closest building in the Grand Mayan to the pool. They have a lot of shuttles and stuff to get you in from the outlying buildings, but I would have been very unhappy if I had to stay in one of those outlying buildings. The clerk did not accept the tip! Be sure to ask for a room close to the pool, if you want to be close to the pools, restruant, beach, spa. Overall, we loved the resort. We were able to get our ocean fix in by finding other beaches. The property, rooms and staff are all excellent. Tips.....get a car...our car bill for the 9 days we were there was 250.00. That includes the mandatory 9 dollars a day mexican liability insurance. If you rent with an American Express card, you are covered insurance wise and don't need the additional insurance. Book tours on your own Go to Playa Del Carmen for shopping and food. There is a Walmart, Sams Club and various large grocery stores there. Go to Xel-Ha for a full day of fun for $59 unlimited food and drink included. Relax and do what you want to do!!!

All the info that I read at Trip Advisor was helpful so I hope this review helps as well We had a group of 7 (6 Adults and One two yr old). We ended up renting two cars so as to have to be attained to the others scheduled in case we wanted to do diff things and with a 2 yr old in our group it turned out to be a GREAT MOVE!!! If you are considering renting a vehicle I highly recommend it as the resort is not close to any where; about a 10 min drive to Playa Morelos and about a 30 min Drive to Playa del Carmen. Also with a car we were able to pick up and go anywhere we wanted at any time and parking was never an issue. One thing that I will suggest; we tried the ballet parking but cancelled it after 2 days as we stayed in Building number 5 of the grand mayan and it was a 5 min walk to the parking lot. Ballet parking is $6 per day. The Resort was AMAZING\u2026It is true what you read that it is HUGE but knowing what to expect made it a lot easier. From our building one of the couples in our group walked to both the pools and did not have any issues at all. My wife, daughter and I took the shuttles and YES it took a bit of more time but my daughter LOVED riding in the shuttles and HEY it is vacation and I want to relax. One draw back; if you have a large group and you ALL indeed want to use the shuttle it will be almost impossible (specially going to and from the pool) as they get full fast. Yes POOLS ARE AMAZING!!! Grand Mayan Pool was nice but was Bathtub warm so we spend most of our time in the Mayan Palace Pool and it was a life saver for us as our daughter absolutely loved it. Beach; Very True; basically if you want to lay out and hang out by the beach it is a great beach but if you are looking to get in the water you better forget it as the rocks start from the very beggining of the water line. We were told that there was a nice beach about a 10 min walk from the hotel but we did not go to it. Playa has very nice beaches so go there if you want to swim in the ocean. Prices\u2026Actually I did not think they were too bad. We ate our first night at the grand mayan pool and for an order of Flautas (Chicken Tacos) which had 3 tacos, salad and Guacamole was $7. Yes more than most places but if you are planning on eating or drinking anything at ANY resort expect to pay more. Also the gratuity is already included even for Room Svc. Here are some tips. 1.As you have read, take advantage of Happy Hr. Just make sure you both want the same drink as it is 2 for 1 but has to be same kind of drink. 2.NOTE we there is a daily Special Drink that is 2 for 1 the entire day..make sure you ask as they will not volunteer this info. We found out last day we were there 3.The cabanas can be rented for $30 per day but if you order $30 of food and drink then they waive the charge and if you have a group it is not hard to hit the $30. 4.If you do not want to spend the money for dinners at the hotel; specially for the buffets which I do agree are high $70 per person or so, rent a car, Puerto Morelos is about a 10 min Drive and there is about 10 rests there you can eat at. Or plan your trips to Playa in the PM\u2019s so you can eat there. 5.If you go to PLAYA you have to GO eat at HC BUTCHER SHOP WOOOOOOW I could have eaten there EVERY DAY, you are talking about 7 of us ate for $60 including drinks\u2026.and the meat is GREAT. Some of the best stakes I ever had. 6.If you go to Cozumel I recommend to do the snorkeling, we went with a CO called ABUELAS (Last booth on the peer after you get off the ferry) $25 per person and it is about a 3hr trip\u2026Absolutely worth it. Other than that All I have to say is that we enjoyed it and that we would do it again in a heart beat. You will have your glitches but make the best of it. Feel Free to ask me any Q\u2019s.

We read many of the reviews and did ALOT of research before going. We had a total of 7 in our group -- 6 adults and our 2 1/2 year old little girl. This is was the most beautiful place I've EVER been to!! The resort itself is HUGE -- we stayed in bldg #5 of the Grand Mayan which turned out to be about a 5 min walk to the main pool/beach. Since our dgter LOVED the shuttles - I think they reminded her of a train -- we used them frequently. Sometimes there was a 10 min wait or so but not usually. If you've read the other reviews -- they're not kidding -- the pool is unbelieveable!!!! We spent most of our time at the larger main pool because the smaller pool for the grand mayan guests only was too warm. It's so kid friendly!! There's a Kid's activity area at the large pool w/ activities for all ages. I know there had to be alot of people there but it NEVER seemed crowded. We had the 2 bedroom grand suite and had TONS of room. Housekeeping svs were awesome -- the rooms were spotless. They came twice a day to clean the rooms,etc. The room airconditioning worked wonderfully -- we like it cold in our room..8-) We thought about not renting a car -- because of many of the reviews - but in the end rented one and am very glad we did. With a 2 year old - we didn't have to wait out in the extreme heat for transportation and if she got cranky/tired - we could always go. There's plenty of parking at the resort - don't bother w/ valet service - the parking lots are close to the bldings. Some tips: 1 - several places have daily 2 for 1 happy hours -- saves alot on drinks 2 - the swim up bars in the pool have daily 2 for 1 drink specials till 500pm -- they won't tell you about it - you have to ask. 3 - costs $30 to rent a palapa but if you spend $30 in food &/or drinks they won't charge you the rental fee. 4 - beach there is awesome but in water -- very rocky - MUST wear solid water shoes. 5 - people told us if you walk approx 10 min down the beach it's better for swimming - not rocky. 6 - there's laundry svc area in each blding - it's very affordable - you can do it yourself or someone can do it for you. I wish I had walked around the resort more - there's several walking paths and we saw a crocodile in the lake and there's also a flamingo park. The landscaping is breathtaking!

Plenty of activities for all ages in the family. It's true about the rocky beach. The place is super large, but we stayed in Building 1, only a short walk from the Grand Mayan pool. I read the other reviews and they were helpful, so that is why I am doing the same. There are 3 things we wish to share with fellow travelers that may help you: We booked a tour called \"Coba - The Mayan Experience\" @ $100.00 each. Full day tour and just recently opened. Our tour guide was \"Mack\" (Mauricio at the Mexican travel knows about this tour and has recently been on it with his family.) It was probably the highlight of our trip. Mack was a great guide as we traveled to Coba. We rode bicycles to the step pyramid, climbed to the top (which you can no longer do at Chichenitza) and other ruins at Coba. We visited a Mayan village, had a wonderful lunch with the Mayan people (The nine of us were the only people there that day - because this tour is so new.) We jumped into and swam in a cenote, rode 2 long zip-lines across a lake, canoed, and relaxed in hammocks. It was a relaxed tour and we could take as long as we wanted at each location which was wonderful. Highly Recommend. We decided not to visit Chichen . as originally planned because it was 3 hours into the jungle just to get there. We snorkeled in Puerto Morelos, a National Park and Reef; saw barracuda and lots of beautiful fish, but would have preferred to snorkel at Xel-Ha instead, looking back. Some of our group got sea-sick out in the ocean, and had we gone to Xel-Ha, that wouldn't have happened, plus we would have seen amazing things there (from all that we have heard and read). Puerto Morelos was closer to get to using the public transportation than Playa del Carmen and much smaller. Playa Del Carmen was fun at night - air-conditioned bus ride $2.00 each way per person. One thing worth mentioning at the Grand Mayan - they have a doctor on the premisis 24/7. I cut my finger pretty deep, and Dr. Palomino was able to see to taking care of it. He only charged me for the antibiotic, Cipro - but not for the office call. Wow! You may want to consider taking some antibiotic with you from home - it will be much less $$. The Cipro is a good anti-biotic for wounds that are exposed to water. Anyway, as long as it is some relatively simple medical issue, they can take care of you at the resort, which we found to be such a blessing. We were so appreciative of this extra care. The Grand Mayan is Grand and we would go there again. Probably would eat out in Puerto Morelos and/or bring food back to resort for later. The prices for authentic (hole-in-the-wall) Mexican food there are inexpensive, and the food is great - just make sure to ask someone who lives there the best places to eat. We met a woman who is from Seattle who lives there - she told of a great little authentic place to eat. We never got sick from the food we ate. All in all, we had an incredible time at and away from the resort.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cNot a relaxing place for couples\u201d", "Author": "catherine529", "ReviewID": "UR8263306", "Content": "After having read some reviews here, upon arrival at the Grand Mayan we requested a room in one of the lower-numbered buildings and were put in Bldg.#2. It was a good location since it was a short walk to the pools. The hotel itself is well-kept, has very clean grounds and the pools as everybody would say, are amazing. However, if you are a couple looking for a romantic & relaxing vacation, this is not the place for you. The majority of the guests are families with young children, and if you end up next to them, you WILL HEAR THEM. The walls to the adjoining rooms are so thin that you will feel like you are vacationing with the people next door. If you get unlucky like we did, you will end up next to a noisy family who did not have any consideration whatsoever even after being asked nicely to please keep it down when it is late at night so that we can get some sleep. I read a previous review here that folding newspapers and sticking them in between the cracks of the door helped reduce the noise level but I am telling you my effort of doing all that at 1:00 AM did not make the situation any better. We also found the management to be of not much help; I guess they are used to hearing the same complaint since they told us that so far we were the first couple who complained THAT WEEK. We were told there wasn't much they could do and if we wanted to move we can, but to a building farther away from the pools. First of all , this was an inconvenience for us just to have to re-pack everything in our suitcase, unpack all over again, then we, the NON-noisy guests, are the ones to be moved to a building where we would have to shuttle back and forth just to move around the hotel facilities?? Anyhow, to make the long story short, we were left sleepless for our first three nights and the fourth night we decided we had to give up our fight and just move to the other building just so we can get some decent sleep. The management also gave us a hard time about getting a refund on a tour that we had to cancel due to lack of sleep, but that is another story...Overall, I would certainly NOT recommend this hotel to couples. And yes, the beach is indeed VERY rocky!! If you decide to swim in it, you have to be extra careful not to hit your head on one of the big and slimy rocks.", "Date": "July 30, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cA grend time at the Grand Mayan\u201d", "Author": "wawawhee", "ReviewID": "UR8243740", "Content": "We visited the Grand Mayan as an RCI trade. The room and grounds are beautiful and well kept although there is ongoing construction. The staff was friendly and accommodating . This is not an all-inclusive resort and is designed as a cashless system that has all resort charges billed to your room. An account is established at check in with a credit card and your authorized signature(s) that is entered into the system. The prices at most of the restaurants and bars are comparable to big U.S. city tourist area prices. Room service is very reasonable and Havana Moon is a picturesque restaurant on the beach. There is a travel agency on site that can set up tours to area attractions. If you are interested in Cancun the price for a cab is 23 dollars. The cost of a taxi to the resort from the airport is 73 dollars. The resort will arrange airport transport for 15 dollars per person. You can take a shuttle to the front entrance and catch a collectivo to Playa Del Carmen for 2 dollars per person or the bus for about the same price. Playa Del Carmen has a beautiful beach, many restaurants, a Wal-Mart and a ferry to Cozumel for 14 dollars p/p r/t. There are shows that are put on nightly, but since this resort is mainly family oriented, there is not much nightlife. We did the Vacation Ownership presentation and were given a room credit and 10% charge discount. Make sure at check-out that this is applied. Also a bottle of water was put into the room that I never touched and was billed 1.50. My fault that I was in a hurry to catch the shuttle to the airport.

As we were checking in, we were told that we had to wear plastic bracelets at all times. This did not make leaving the resort a pleasurable or safe time. All the locals saw the bracelets, and knew we were tourists. We were also given one beach towel per person and told if we lost them, we would have to pay a 30 dollar charge. You can turn in your towels at the pool and get new ones but be very careful they give you the right amount of towels back. We had 8 in our party and they always seemed to miscount. The website / brochure that we saw said there was a kitchen with refridgerator in the room. Do not be fooled. Unlike the other resorts we have stayed, this one had a very small two burner stove and a fridge that is smaller than the one you brought to college with you. Shopping at the resort store was not even worth emergency buys. We paid nine dollars for pancake syrup, six dollars for bread, etc. There is a Walmart in Playa. We had read the reviews and planned to shop there but the fridge just would not hold anything but a few bottles of water and one to go container. The busses into Playa were reasonable and the cabs were negotiable. Be prepared for very high pressure sales tactics when you are given your \"tour.\" My mother was having bad hip pain during our stay and they initially refused to give her a wheel chair during the mandatory walking tour. Hawai, Vegas, Florida, and the Bahamas hold no candle to the sales pressure here. You are told if you do not buy, you will not be welcomed back for five years. They pass you from person to person trying to make you sign a deal. The problem with spraying for insects seemed to be fixed by the time we stayed there. We saw them spray only once. However, the bugs were everywhere at night. The spray works evidently because when you wake up in the morning their are dozens of bugs laying dead on the floor. The beach leaves ALOT to be desired. When the reviews say \"rocky,\" they understate the problem. There are slime covered rocks with holes in them that just beckon for your ankle for the first 20 meters or so off the beach. You must be VERY careful trying to get into the water. Once you get into deeper water it gets a little better but be careful; there are a lot of big concrete pieces about 5 feet below the surface just off the beach. I don't know if this was dumped to make an artificial reef or just left there but it is quite dangerous. The waves can easily push you into it. The golf course that they advertise for only 70 dollars is a 3-par course. There are no long holes on it and is amatuer in design. Do not go there to golf! The rooms could not stay cool. The air conditioners ran all the time and kept the rooms only at about 80 degrees F. They did not do a very good job of dehumidifying the air either. The rooms were always warm and somewhat damp. The pool was the shining star. A huge pool is the centerpiece of the resort. We spent most of our time there. If you wake up early and reserve one of the grass huts, the day can be perfect. It is big enough to allow the rowdy crowd and the family crowd completely different areas with no overlap. The service was great. The individual people who work there are very nice and will do anything for you. Playa is beautiful at night if you go to Fifth avenue. Cozumel was nice too. All in all, the resort is failry nice but very, very expensive to stay at. The pool was great, the golf course small, the beach rocky, and the rooms were warm. Not a bad stay but not particulary enjoyable either.

Room service very reasonable. Everyone packs the kitchen with groceries from Walmart - it's part supermarket there! They do not offer an all inclusive , so if you are a drinker you will be spending alot! Take advantage of happy hour 11am -1pm. Location- Resort is situated midway between Cancun and Playa del Carmen. You are also close to ferry to Cozumel or Isla Mujeres as well. So if you rent a car - even for a few days- you can combine a beautiful, but quiet resort, with the more active areas of Cancun or Playa del Carmen a half hour drive in either direction. If you would rather taxi it- you can share a cab -it's about $30-35 cab ride one way to these other towns. I still recommend renting a car - it works out cheaper and you have the freedom to move around. Excursions: The Resort runs some nice excursion trips- one is to clubs in Cancun at night, beach trips, boat rides etc.. Scuba was worth it. Golf- If you are a serious golfer, the course is beautiful. Accomodations- We had a two bedroom master suite complete with three terraces (one terrace had a small pool on it), kitchen , living room, sleeps 10 including two bedrooms and various couches, we had 6 and were very comfortable. There were two beautiful bathrooms each having a separate jacuzzi area. As I said the room accomodations were 5 star!! Pools and Beach- There are pools everywhere at this resort. I believe there are at least a dozen. Almost no one used the hotel beach area because the water is too rough and filled with rocks. ( We went to Playa Del Carmen and Isla Mujeres for beautiful beaches). Grounds- The grounds are beautiful but the resort involves alot of walking to and from pools, restaurants etc.. There is a shuttle service but you have to be patient and wait for it. Certain pools etc are only accessible by walking. If you have problems walking due to health reasons this is the wrong resort for you. Nightlife- Although I believe this was one of the best vacations we have had, we all agreed it was too quiet at night. Restaurant Shows end around 9pm, and beach party with DJ ended at 10:30 , that was the latest and best night event of the week. They really need to have more nightlife. Bars close 11-11:30.. The resort caters to the daytime crowd, alot of families with young children, toddlers to 15. Older teens and young adults were few and far between. Our college age kids were bored and we all left resort on several nights. We rented a car and drove half hour to Playa del Carmen and Cancun. Worth it!! Shopping, beaches , jet skiing, restaurants and bars in Playa are very good and close.

The beach is not bad but not as pretty as most of the hotels at playa del carmen. The pool and rest areas were also very clean.

The property is huge and has pretty pathways. There is construction but it did not interfere at all. Barely heard it! There is a huge pool for all guests and then another one for Grand Mayan guests only. We spent time at both but enjoyed the Grand Mayan pool better. It was smaller and more personal. The staff were incredible. They entertained (learn to make cocktails - more of a drinking game and fun!) and assisted with any request. We had a pinata for a birthday and they strung it up, sang, and turned it into a party for everyone!! Lupita and her team were great! Plenty of happy hours and drink specials. See the ruins. They are awe inspiring.Chichen is tremendous and very \"organized\". Coba is very rustic and has the only pyramid you can climb (it's tall and steep!). Pay for a guide, at least you'll know what you're looking at, otherwise you won't get it. We got the bikes at Coba and that added to the fun and preserved our energy.

We had a 2 bedroom, which you can not understand how big it is until you see it, just trust me you WILL love it! We had decided to extend our stay by one night so we flew into Cozumel and stayed at EL CID for that night. We did enjoy the airport, but we really wish that we did not stay in Cozumel. First of all, one night was not enough to enjoy it and second of all we were disappointed with our hotel, the air did not work well. We were definately exhausted by the time we took the ferry over to Playa. Just thought I would let anyone out there who even thinks of doing something like this know, don't do it!! O.K., we rented a car from America car rental, got the full coverage for around $370.00 for the week, they picked us up at the Playa ferry and drove us to The Grand Mayan. They had someone coming from Cancun anyway, so that is the only reason they drove us to the resort. By the way, they also picked up the car at the resort before we left, very nice to not have to worry about getting back to Playa and then finding a taxi back to the resort. We did enjoy having a car, my husband had no problems driving, but there were several times that I would have been scared to do so myself. It was me, my husband, and our 8 year old daughter and she LOVED having the king sized bed and jacuzzi tub to herself. Of course my husband and I did as well. The bed were very comfy, I had read about them being hard, but they were firm and I guess that is what we like because we all three slept great! There is some walking at the resort, we stayed in building seven on the first floor which we thought was fine. Building 4 and 5 seemed farther away form everything, if you happen to get in one of those plan on the shuttles. They do come through at least every 20 minutes. We did comment to ourselves that older or out of shape people may have a hard time walking to everything, we did not! The kitchen was nice to have even though we did not use except for breakfast and snacks, we were on vacation and did not want to cook alot. We had anticipated going the grocery store in Playa and stocking up, but for what we needed the resort had in their grocery store. Yes, the prices are a little high. Here's the trick though, don't buy imported American items and you will be fine. Example, we did splurge and buy a $6.00 bag of Doritos (Yes, $6.00), but we also got a Mexican brand of chocolate wafers that were really good for $1.50! And we snacked on those all week and still had some left in the bag when we left. So many people are afraid to try new things and miss out. Don't be! There were also different brands of water and milk. We always got the cheaper brands and were happy. LA LA is the milk (around $2.50), they had another brand that was twice as expensive, but LA LA was good. Also, the water we always got was around $3.50 for 3 LITRES. I don't think this is expensive, do you? Now for the dining options, ate at Tramonto twice, Havana Moon twice, Balche several times for lunch and once for dinner. All were very good. Tramonto is Italian and the ony one that is air condition. You get used to eating without air condition, it is not as important down there and there is always fans and a good breeze. We ate off the resort in Playa, Cozumel, Akumel, and Puerto Morelos and never had air conditioning. We do recommend going off the resort some, that's when you really experience MEXICO! Bringing me to our excursions, we rode horses on the beach and into the ocean at Rancho Loma Bonita, snorkeled the reef in Puerto Morelos, snorkeled in Cozumel just next to our hotel, went to Tulum, went to Akumel and swam right next to sea turtles, also snorkeled in Yal-ku Lagoon, and last but certainly not least swam and snorkeled through Dos Ojos cenote! We stayed very busy the first part of our week, but our last three days we just chilled around the resort, there was plenty to keep our daughter occupied there. I have to HIGHLY recommend EDVENTURE TOURS, that is who we used to do the cenote, sea turtles, and Yal-ku lagoon. Gilmer was our guide and we loved every minute of that day!!!!!! They have a website, so just do search. We left out of Cancun's new terminal three and it was EASY AS PIE! No complaints there at all.

The shuttle to the resort was easily identifiable, and the taxi drivers were on us like vultures. We were happy to take the shuttle to and from the airport, and to the edge of the resort to catch the bus. Traffic moves very fast, and I don't know where we would have parked in Playa del Carmen. There are many one-way streets, buses, taxis, and tourists. We never felt unsafe and the tour groups are very well-managed. The tour buses are very modern, and even the local express bus we took into town was new and air-conditioned. It gave us a chance to squeeze in with the locals and everyone was very helpful. Tourism in Mexico is down 30% and it felt good to spend my dinero there. Our days to stay at the resort seemed far too few, and we loved the restaurants, especially Havana Moon.

My parents have a timeshare at the Grand Mayan and I went with one of my friends and her family who bought a week through my parents. I have stayed at the Mayan Palace in Nuevo Vallarta, Mayan Sea Garden in Mazatlan, and the Grand Mayan in Riviera Maya twice. The resort in Riviera Maya is by far my favorite so far. I have never been to an all-inclusive resort, but from what I hear it can be extremely expensive. From what I understand, you would need to eat and drink a ton each day and not leave the resort at night to get your money\u2019s worth. We went to Playa del Carmen four nights and Cancun one. There isn\u2019t a disco at the resort like there are at many all-inclusive resorts, so it is well worth it to go into town for fun. Everything at the resort is cash-free, and everything gets charged to your room. There is a 15% tip included on food and drinks. If you don\u2019t want to pay $18 for a taxi, you can ride the Playa Express for $1.50/person; you just have to have patience because it sometimes takes a while. There is also a larger bus that runs for about the same price. We took the Playa Express every time except for riding the bus back once and taking a taxi back twice because it was late and the buses weren\u2019t running anymore. Some people prefer to rent a car, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. Also, I believe we called ahead for transportation from the airport that was free. We also called for transportation back to the airport which I believe was $15/person. There are tons of things to do on the resort during the day. The activities staff at the pool is great and very friendly and they always have something going on\u2026 there is something for everyone. They play beach and water volleyball, soccer on the beach, give dance lessons and cocktail lessons, stretching lessons, meditation sessions on the beach, and also have many activities for smaller children. The pool is the biggest in Latin America, and they have built the new pool for Grand Mayan guests since I was there two years ago. It also has some activities for children and can be a little quieter. The restaurants we ate at on the resort were Havana Moon and Tramonto and both were very good. Tramonto had EXCELLENT Italian food. We also ordered many drinks throughout the week at the pool. We tried to only order during 2-for-1 happy hour (11am-1pm) or if we liked the drink special for the day, that was 2-for-1 until 5pm. The rooms in the Grand Mayan are beautiful and very big. Five of us stayed comfortably in the Grand Master Suite. Some of my relatives stayed in a Grand Master Suite also with a group of eight, and they were extremely happy with their vacation. There is maid and turn down service every day. There is also a large balcony with a small pool. It\u2019s nice for cooling off because the water is pretty cold. There are a couple down sides to the resort. The beach: it is far more developed than it was two years ago BEFORE the hurricanes, but there still isn\u2019t too much going on. It is very rocky and hard to walk up and down. The size: it is a huge resort and there can be a lot of walking depending on where your building is; however, there are shuttles from the lobby that take you to the pool, the Mayan Palace, the front gate, and the golf course. The location: it is in an area where it is not very close to a lot of other resorts, which can be nice if you\u2019re looking for something more quiet and peaceful. It is way different from the hotel zone in Cancun where all the resorts are on top of each other, and it is about a 45 minute ride to Cancun and about a 20 minute ride to Playa del Carmen. Overall, it\u2019s a beautiful resort and it\u2019s my favorite resort I\u2019ve ever been to. I can\u2019t wait to go back for my third time in March for Spring Break with a bunch of my friends. There is construction going on right now which I believe some people said was going to be a water park with a lazy river. I\u2019m not sure when it\u2019s supposed to be finished, but I\u2019m hoping sometime soon. It is a great resort for people of all ages: whether you\u2019re older or younger or have small kids, there is always something for you to do. I would recommend it to anyone.

This place was absolutely amazing and I would recommend it for almost anyone. I want everyone to know a lot about going to this resort before you make your final decision to stay there, and if you already booked it - what to expect. Be prepared this is going to be long. The ages in my group were: 18, 21,24,25, and 26. 1. ARRIVAL - When you arrive in the Cancun airport please be ready for a nightmare that awaits you the second you walk out those doors to find your shuttle. We got there around 7:30 at night and it was LOADED with people trying to get you to take their outragously priced taxi's. Simply look straight ahead for your Grand Mayan sign and dart for him. ** PLEASE NOTE** In Mexico apparently EVERYONE works for tips, so your gonna be dishing out A LOT of money for tips if your like me and feel bad for not. DO NOT tip them a lot because if you do, your gonna be broke by the end of the week. $1 is plenty for just about everything. 2. CHECK IN - We got to the resort pretty late and I was afraid of getting put into one of the Mayan Palace rooms (which isn't nearly HALF as nice as the Grand Mayan) as some of the other people have claimed happened to them. But even though we got there almost at 9:00 at night we still got our room at the Grand Mayan. Please be aware that you will have to put a $4000 PESO [roughly $400 US dollars] deposit on your room account. They can split up seperate accounts if you have other guests along in your group. As I read in other reviews people have stated that they've been bothered by timeshare reps trying to get them to go to a presentation. NOT ONE person bothered us with that, however I wish they would have! haha you get money taken off your excursion prices and you get a free $21 dollar buffet for breakfast, and sometimes they throw in extras like a $100 dollar room credit. So I think if we would have been asked I would have done it. 3. THE ROOMS - We had the Grand Master Suite with 2 bedrooms. It was AMAZING! My jaw had hit the floor when I walked in. My boyfriend and I had taken 3 other friends along and we definitely had more than enough room for all 5 of us. Absolutely beautiful is all I have to say! Oh and some reviews complained about construction... NOT ONCE did I hear the construction. I saw it looking out from the balcony at Tramonto but had I not read about it I wouldn't have even known that it was going on. 4. PRICES - Well they weren't TOO bad but some things were a little rediculously priced. Pretty much expect anything that your going to crave [such as milk, chips, cookies, typical american food] to cost a LOT of money! I guess it depends on where you live and how the cost of living is... Around Central PA things are decently priced and I learned how much I love where I live. 5. DINNER - We ate at I think all of the restaurants. My favorite by far was definitely Tramonto (italian cuisine and american steakhouse!) They're steak was to die for and the setting is nice. You do have to make reservations though so make sure you try it out one night. Also the Mexican Fiesta is on Thursday night, and it had a damn good show HOWEVER it was like $100USD for the buffet and show for two people. Had I known that I may have skipped it because you could have watched the show from the private Grand Mayan pool for free! So you can be the judge of that yourself but it was nice to watch. If you want to stay cheap with great food eat at the Pool Snack Bar called Balche. They have good prices and they're food is great! 6. ALCOHOL - Pricey so do the happy hour special when it's 2 for 1. You CANNOT mix and match so you will be getting 2 of the same drink. 7. WALKING - This resort is HUGE! We were in one of the last buidlings for the grand mayan so the pool was only like a quick 5 minute walk away. So if you don't like to walk or can't walk there are a lot of shuttles that take you to the pool and resaurants but they're not always the quickest. We never really had to wait long for one though either so we either got lucky or they came by more frequently. 8. RENTAL OR NOT? - We chose not to rent a car because the prices of car insurance is absolutely rediculous! We probably did the best thing by not renting, because they drive like mad men. Pretty much if you get in an accident and you don't have coverage your responsible for the price of the car and you have to go to jail until you pay back the damages done to the other vehicle and their passengers. They're laws are a lot different than the ones in America. Plus if you take the bus it's only $1.50 to get into town. 9. PURCHASES - Yes the fun part of shopping in Mexico is hagling with prices. But trust me when I say this... you will find that everyone in mexico is for the most part the nicest people you will meet, UNTIL you disrespect them or the stuff they're selling. So please do not do that, because it's not gonna get you anywhere or a cheaper price. OH and don't jump for the first thing you see, chances are it's cheaper somewhere down the street so definitely look around. 10. POOLS - The pools are amazing and they're never crowded because they're so big. It is the largest pool in Latin America so please make time to get in it. Grand Mayan people get the luxury of their own private pool. We only went down to the private pool at night when it was lit up and all the lights change colors it's awesome, trust me you'll enjoy it. Lastly, HAVE FUN! Your vacation IS what you make of it. If you grope about everything and pick on everything you will probably have a rotten time. Make the best of it and DO NOT drink their water. I made the horrible decision of drinking the water when I was drunk and I didn't feel good the rest of the night. They do try to get you to drink bottled water but I insisted that I wanted free water. Please do not make the same drunken mistake I did. =) I hope this was helpful in making your decision or getting prepared... I will DEFINITELY be returning to this resort in a couple years to see their progress.", "Date": "May 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oregon USA", "Title": "\u201cWe loved the Grand Mayan/Mayan Palace!!\u201d", "Author": "Zabidi", "ReviewID": "UR7673189", "Content": "I took my wife and two toddler boys to Mexico from April 27th - May 4th. We stayed at the Grand Mayan part of the Mayan Palace resort in building 1. I read all the reviews before I left and I must say it is the best thing to do before going on a trip. Great advice and tips. Here is my summary: Airport \u2013 As soon as you finish with customs and baggage claim, go strait to the taxis or shuttle that\u2019s waiting for you. Avoid all the people in blue shirt who want to \u201chelp\u201d you. They\u2019re just timeshare people. I knew because they all asked my age and when I said I was 27 they just gave me a little map and sent me off. If I looked older than I do, they would have tried to pressure me to sign up for session. Anyway, as you step out of the airport there are hundreds of people with signs waiting or trying to get you to ride their taxi or bus. Likes: Pool is amazing and you\u2019ve read all about it. It is that and more. Service is excellent, prompt and convenient. Room service is expensive but still pretty good compared to the rest of the options. We only ate at Balche and Havana Moon restaurants. They were both excellent. (Tip: beware of the mosquitoes at Havana moon. I got 50 bites on my ankles). The Grand Mayan has its own pool which was really nice and not crowded at all. But the other pool is much nicer. Dislikes: 15% tip\u2026Always Distance to pool if you\u2019re in a further building. We were in building 1 so it was attached to the pool. Waiting in line at 7 am for the Palapas. The worst thing about this place is the beach. I can\u2019t emphasize how disappointed we were. But the pool makes up for it. Pushy Timeshare\u2026although I only got one call and did not return it and never heard from them again Tips: Take the shuttle from airport to resort but use taxi on the way back. It\u2019s cheaper. Go to Wal-Mart in Playa get everything you need there. The store at the resort is ok for milk and coffee but not other things. But it is worth it if you don\u2019t want to pay for taxi. Taxi from resort to town is $18. From resort to airport is $34. Take the playa express bus to Playa del Carmen. It is sooo much cheaper (20pesos/person about 2 dollars) and it is air conditioned. Don\u2019t believe all the fuss about how dangerous crossing the highway is. It\u2019s not. And I had a 5year old, two year old, and my pregnant wife. Spray insect repellent in the eve if you plan to walk around or eat at Havana Moon. Carry lots of 20 peso bills for tips (about 2 dollars). Go to Playa Del Carmen for a day. The best beach I have ever been to or seen!!!! Highlight of the trip if you\u2019re into white sand and amazing water. Go to Xcaret..pretty good zoo-like park with a nice beach to hang out at when done walking.

I considered this my 2 weeks in paradise. The resort location is soooo beautiful. Located about 25 minutes from Cancun and 15 minutes from Playa del Carmen, its the perfect location. Renting a car is a must if you want to experience true Mexican culture. (which I highly recommend) Traveling to Playa del Carmen is a true delight. Of course there is the typical sellers in there shops, but it is a great day to visit the shops and really learn about the Mexican people. You can also catch the ferry to Cozamel there for about $20.00 each person. I would highly recommend taking a snorkeling trip to Puerto Morelos. You can book a trip from the travel agency desk for about $55.00 a person (adults), children are less. The tour guides there were awesome!!!! About the rooms,yes, its true about the beds. They are very hard.(It just helps you to appreciate your own bed when you return home!) The rooms are cleaned to perfection every day. The maids are so pleasant, but understand very little english. Most everyone else on the property, speaks great english. They even will teach you a little spanish if your curious. The rooms in the grand mayan have great jacuzzi tubs. Take advantage of those whenever possible. Definately use the spa services. I had a couples massage there, and it was the best massage I ever had!!!! The spa services are great after a busy day (try the vapor bath, very refreshing!). I have never found such friendly people as I have in Mexico. They always greet you with a \"Hola\" every time you meet them. The activity desk is also just great. All the personnel is so attentive to the kids and even try to remember their name after the first visit. I can't say enough about \"Guadalupe\"\" at the grand mayan pool. This was our second visit to this location and we will definately be coming back. How can you not love the Carribean??? It's breathtaking!!! Travel to Cancun to see the radiant blue waters.

My wife, myself and our two friends are all 32 and both have children under two. We were very impressed with the grounds, friendly staff, and the overall experience of the pools. The pools are excellent for kids as they are only about 4 feet deep, and have several huge spots that are only a foot deep, so our kids could play freely. The palapas were nice for the kids and their afternoon naps. Reserving a palapa wasn't too bad. Reservation time is at 7:15 a.m., and there are 50 available. I got there around 6:30-6:45 a.m. and was usaully about half way in the group and always got the one I wanted by the kids pool. They also have security that walks around every hour to check to make sure they are actually being used. They will give them away to the next person on the list if they are only being used by someone's hat or book! I think they just started this policy according to some of the other guests. I think it's a good one! There were alson always plenty of chairs if you don't get a palapa. The grand mayan pool was pretty nice, but nothing compared to the big one. It had some round bed-type chairs available to, but you have to get them early before the bone heads show up and throw their stuff down on them and don't come back until the day is almost over so they can have a snooze in the shade for an hour. There's not a good policy to reserve them like at the big pool. There was always activities going on and everyone seemed entertained. Biggest complaint about both pools is the amount of inconsiderate people who smoke with kids around. For a kid friendly place, there are a few people who don't seem to care about their health. Many smokers who just sit there and puff away on their cancer sticks as it blows in your direction. My suggestion is their should be no smoking at the pool. If you're a smoker and are reading this, I hope you look around at all the kids you're effecting with your nasty habit and choose to take a walk somewhere else when you're \"craving\" pops up. The beach is cool. I read that it had tons of rocks. It's actually coral and there are quite a few fish out there. The beach isn't good for a normal person to swim, but if you like fish life and like to snorkel around off the beach, it's pretty good. There are spots you can enter and swim around without having to worry about your feet. I read that you need to ask for an even numbered room, this is true if you want a good view. The rooms are nice and very spacious. The cooling pool was great for the little ones. Only complaint here is the lack of a dishwasher, but it wasn't that bad. The restaurants are pretty good. We had the buffet about every morning until we discovered the 19th hole at the golf course. Much better breakfast in my opinion and a little cheaper. The restaurant on the beach (Havana Moon) is good if you get a table outside facing the beach with the cool breeze. If not, you might melt under the fans inside. We lucked out both times we ate there. I would suggest waiting for a table on the beach. The golf course is great. It's a par 3, but much harder than anything i've ever played. Hole 18 was a nightmare and we lost about 8 balls on hole 3. It has a few holes that are well over 200 and if you play the blacks, it's almost like a couple par 4s. We rented a van as suggested. Well worth it! We went into playa del carmen a few late afternoons for dinner to mix it up and shopped around there. You can't really go wrong with many places to eat. It was really cool. We also were able to attend Xel-Ha, which probably would have been better without the kids since they weren't exactly ready to swim around at their age. The water clarity there was not great. There was about 10 foot visability and a blurry film you had to swim through if you wanted to see a little deeper. (gross!) The buffet they sell you with your admission looks like the late night left overs at ryans family steakhouse. the only thing good was the soft serve icecream. It was all you can drink there, so if you're into getting wasted and going for a swim in a huge lake, this place is perfect for you. We probably spent about 2 hours there and if we hadn't had the van, we would have been stuck there for probably another 6! All in all, we will go back. Do go grand mayan, or you'll be out in the boonies! The place is really big, but walks to and from the pool aren't bad unless you're fat and out of shape or old.

Most important tip I can offer is to rent a CAR. We were exploring every day and saw many people jamming into tiny taxis or waiting for the bus. The rooms are huge and quite nicely furnished. The beds are very comfortable and the shower and whirlpool are outstanding. The pools are beyond belief in terms of size and cleanliness. We stayed mostly at the new Grand Mayan pool ( which should be greatly expanded by construction almost completed) but went to the Mayan Palace beach restaurants for lunch. Playa del Carmen is a great value for dinner and we had two excellent dinners at Media Luna on Fifth Avenue. The flow of humanity reminded me a bit of Greenwich Village and the shopping was OK. We went to snokel and fish three times in Akamal and had a great time. It is about 45 minutes south of the Grand Mayan but the beach is very beautiful and we saw turtles and baby turtles, sting rays and about 15 types of fish within 100 yards of shore. If you are down near Tulum you might consider spending a night at the Boca Paila Camps and enjoying a huge pristine beach, outstanding and very cheap food, great ecotouring and kayaking and very challenging bonefishing. The accomodations are quite primative (tents under thatched roofs) but the people are very helpful and its a real trip back in time. This Camp in within a 1.3 MILLION acre nature preserve set up by the Mexican Government in 1986. I looked for Al Gore but did not see him. We will definitely return to the Grand Mayan as it will only get better as the construction is completed.

Thanks to all of those who posted on Trip Advisor about the Grand Mayan as it helped prepare us for the good and the not so good features associated with this resort. We have provided with a albeit long overview of our experience at the resort. Hope it is helpful. Happy Vacationing!!! Overall, it was a great place to stay and we had a wonderful time. Rooms - We stayed at the Grand Mayan in a 2 bedroom unit - very spacious, nicely decorated and appointed and good amenities. We had friends staying at the Mayan Palace which was also nice but, in our opinion, not as fancy or appointed as the GM. We had a larger patio, our own cold plunge pool (outside) and nearly a full kitchen. Lots of space to stretch out and move around. Bugs - Yes there were some bugs but nothing significant or noteworthy. Perhaps it was the time of year we were there but there were no mosquitoes or other major insect problems as indicated by other write ups. However, every night at 5pm there is a guy that walks around the resort and sprays deet (or something like that). The resort says it is perfect safe for guests but it does smell so good it is important you have all your windows and doors shut between 5 & 6pm (we learned the hard way). Walk to the Pools - This is a very big resort. I mean big. Depends where you are, the walk to the pool from your room can be 2 minutes or 20 minutes. We were in building 6 so for us it was only about 5-7 minutes along the path. Our friends were in building 19 which was a 20 minute walk. Pools - WOW!!!! These pools were huge and amazing. We were there during Holy Week and the resort was sold out and we did not feel like it was crowded at all. We were able to get a seat every day without effort. We were generally down at the pools by 8:30 and always got seats where we wanted them. There is a separate GM pool area if desired. This is a smaller pool and they have padded chases, sand, etc. We had the option of going to either pool area. We were at the GM pool most of the time. Getting Around the Resort - As we mentioned, this is a big resort. There are lots of shuttles to take you to various destinations within the resort. They are supposed to come every 5 - 10 minutes but we found they were not always reliable. Because we do not mind walking and were in no hurry to get anywhere, this was not a big deal. There were bell hops available to take us to and from the lobby during check-in/check-out. Getting to the Resort - Book the resort shuttle! The cost is $15 US per person versus $75 usd by cab. It is about a 35-40 minute drive to the resort from the airport. You will need to email the resort at least 2 days before your arrival. You will need to receive an email confirmation from the resort to ensure you are on the list. Service - Spectacular!!!! Weather in the restaurants or around the resort, there was a ton of staff available to answer any questions, get directions, and make your vacation effortless. Spa and Gym - This was a nice facility. It costs $10usd a day to use the gym and $30usd a day for the spa (hot tub, steam room etc, massages, etc are extra). There is a special where you can use the spa and the gym all week for $100usd (2 people). We did not opt for this and did not feel like we missed out. Construction - Again, perhaps it was the time of year we were there, but we barely heard any construction at all. We saw where they were building the new pools, lazy river, etc but there was little if any noise. We were told they are planning to have all the construction completed by the end of 2007. Food - Hit and Miss. There were a few great places to eat on the resort. The Juice Bar at the spa (great view overlooking the ocean - enjoy a smoothie after working out), Havana Moon for Breakfast (right on the beach, reasonable prices - $6 - 8 usd for breakfast) and Tramonto (wine, steaks, sea food, etc - a bit more expensive, $15 - 40 usd - but well worth it). The buffets were okay but in our opinion not worth the money ($25 - 60 per night, depending on the theme). Getting into Town (Playa del Carmen) - Frustrating! Essentially, there are 2 ways to get into town (1) taxi $18 usd each way or (2) bus ($1.5 usd each way). The bus is great and no big deal to take but it takes way longer (60 minutes) than a taxi which is 20- 25 minutes. If you take the bus, you have to take a shuttle from the lobby to the front of the resort, then cross the hiway (not a big deal) and then wait for the bus to come (essentially, it is a VW Van. This can either be a 2 minute wait or 20 minutes (we experienced both). It also depends on how many people are traveling with you. The bus probably only holds 12 people so if there are not enough seats to accommodate everyone, you wait for the next one. There is not bus schedule, so you just have to stand there until another one comes. There run until 11:15pm. We took the bus into town every time (3) but by the end, the $18 cab trip was not looking so bad. 2 great places for dinner in town was Los Rancheros and La Parillea (sp).

The property is very clean and well kept, staff were very pleasant. Prices for food and drink aren't bad compared to the same at home in Nova Scotia, Canada - $2,300 Cdn for 4 adults for the week and we didn't hold back on anything, 3 meals a day almost everyday at the resort. Negatives - The concierge really screwed-up having our guests picked-up at the airport and weren't very apologetic - they did offer to pay for transportation back to the airport after we complained. Service was bad one morning and the 15% mandatory gratuity is a real burn when you can't do anything about it. Lastly, my wife is very allergic to Sesame of any kind and was served 3 replacement dishes in a row with sesame even after we tried to explain the situation/problem to the waiter and the manager - lesson learned was; if you have any kind of medical issue learn enough Spanish to make sure you're understood, it is Mexico.

We loved the Grand Mayan. The rooms are beautiful and very clean. I did find our room smelled musty. My husband has travelled to India and the Phillipines and said that the smell was the same in his rooms there. The housekeeping does an amazing job twice a day. I did not find the beds too hard and was asleep within seconds of lying down each night. The pool is amazing and I can not say enough about it. It is huge, just the right temperature and very very clean. It is great to spend the day just swimming to each area. We had a lot of fun watching the \"Crazy Games\" each day at 3p.m. while leaning over an infinity edge. Pool bar is great and '2 for 1\" from 11-1 worked out great each day. We never wanted a palyapa as we wanted sun and had no problem finding 5 chairs we could put together each day. We loved the Baleche Bar for lunch, but not for dinner. Only because we are a pretty traditional meat and potato kind of family. The new restaurant Havana Moon was great. Both places have live bands during dinner. I think half of the new pool area was about to open any day now. The other half (which is huge) will not be ready for a long time by the looks of it. (Maybe the end of 2007). I understand this new pool is for Grand Mayan guests only. The resort is large but the walk is really not long at all from any of the Grand Mayan building. It is a beautiful walk and the property is much smaller than what we are use to at our home resort in Florida. We did not really miss being able to swim in the ocean as the pool was amazing. My boys love the surf in Cancun for boogie boards etc. but as a mom I found the pool more relaxing. I didn't worry about my children's safety at all at the resort. We were only asked about the timeshare upon arriving. We said no thanks. Nobody else asked again. My son went on the diving excursion from the resort. $90USD. It was great. He was not certified but they have a beginners trip. They also have a snorkling trip every day at 1p.m from the resort. I think it was $40. My husband and other son went golfing and paid $69/ each, which included clubs and a cart. It is a par 3 but nice. SkiDoo rental I think was $75. We rented a car for the week which was great. We went to Walmart for groceries and went to Playa Del Carmen most nights for dinner. I loved 5th Ave. with all of the beautiful restaurants with live bands etc. Also went to Xel-Ha and Akumel. Had a great time at both. Puerto Morelos was not worth the drive in. You can rent a car at the resort if you just want it for a day. I don;t know what the price is.

It is huge. It was definitely not my cup of tea. I'd liken it to being on a cruise. If you want to go to a resort and pretty much stay there the whole time, going on an occasional excursion, then this place is for you. The lobby was ALWAYS packed with people either checking in, checking out, on their way to an activity or on their way back. Everything was too spread out. There are 2 hotels on this property - the Grand Mayan and the Mayan Palace. I stayed in the Grand Mayan. I had a studio with a king size bed. The room was very nice. I loved the bathroom - with a separate shower and a jacuzzi tub. I was on the ground floor and it had a patio. The 2 negatives (well 3) about the room were the tubs jets didn't all work (this was a minor inconvenience). The room was very far away from the pool, beach, and restaurants. The biggest problem for me was the smell. I don't think the A/C is kept turned up enough. It was a very moldy, musty smell. I suppose I could have asked for another room, but I didn't feel like moving. I had to wash all my clothes when I got home to get rid of the smell. Someone else complained about this in their review. Also, the ice machine closest to my room was not working the whole time I was there. Mind you, I didn't complain about any of this as they were mostly minor issues for me. The pool is enormous and busy. The restaurants were good. The beach - well what can I say, you can't swim in the water because it is on a reef. Walking the beach (going to the left) was nice, the coastline was beautiful, but the beach was full of trash. Bad trash (not that there's good trash but these things are particularly bad for the ocean and animal life) - bottles, plastic bags, shoes (I could have opened a mismatched shoe store with all the shoes I saw!). It was really depressing. I wanted to go back and get a trash bag and start picking up trash. I wouldn't have made a dent though. The resort itself was very far away from everything. You didn't even feel like you were in Mexico. The buildings looked like office buildings. The resort is about 45 minutes from Cancun and about 30 minutes from Playa del Carmen. Taxi's can get expensive. The bus to Playa del Carmen is only about $1.50 one way. The only thing is you have to cross the highway to get to it and you're taking your life in your hands trying to cross. Otherwise, it's a good way to go. I loved Mexico, particularly Playa del Carmen and Isla Mujeres. I would definitely go back, but not to this resort. Oh, one other positive, the staff were very nice and accomodating. And, if you go to the timeshare presentation (boy are they pushy!) you get $100 off your final bill plus 10% off, a discount on an activity, and a free breakfast.", "Date": "March 6, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC", "Title": "\u201cVery Nice, but mostly for families and people over 50.\u201d", "Author": "Ski'nSun", "ReviewID": "UR6917845", "Content": "Perfect place if, you have young kids or are over 50.

We stayed at the Grand Mayan from Feb 9th thru Feb 16th. First of all the resort itself is very nice but my biggest complaint is it is way too big. Our room was a Grand Master Suite and it was perfect for our two families- I will give the room a thumbs up. The pool was very beautiful. The problem was that the pool was so far from all the rooms. The pool bar is another downer, it closes at 6 p.m. every day even Friday and Saturday. If you like Mexican food then don't stay here they don't serve it (well on Thursday's they have a buffet Mexican night but you have to pay alot for it). The resort is in tin buck too so if you like to be near civilization where people are fun and there is stuff going on then don't stay here. We read all the reviews and should have changed our reservation to another resort but I wanted to give it a chance. I know I will never stay at this resort again. We spent so much money in just cab fare alone. You are about an hour from Cancun and about 30 minutes from Playa Del Carmen. We loved Playa Del Carmen and Cozumel but everything was so far from our resort and inconvenient. We had more family that came in on Feb 11th and they were very disappointed too. There room was at the Mayan Palace and they were even further away. It just didn't feel like a vacation this time. The service was great, the grounds were nice but it just wasn't what we are used to. We aren't party animals we just like to have fun and this was not a fun place. Also there is construction going on so that was a drag too. Workers, construction equipment, while you are on vacation is not a good idea.

We had a great time at this resort and would definitely recommend it and would definitely come back. We rented a car as we wanted to have flexibility to get around when we wanted to. We drove to Chichen Itza one day and the trip there was fabulous. We also went into Playa Del Carmen twice, once for groceries and once to stroll down their 5th Ave. shops. We also spent one day at Xcaret. While we enjoyed Xcaret, I'm not sure it's worth the money that they charge to get into it. For four of us to go in with a 30 minute dolphin encounter and a CD with 8 pictures it cost around $780 ($480 was the dolphin encounter and photos and $300 was the park admissions). That is much more expensive than a several day pass to Disneyland. The pool at this resort is amazing. It has two swim up bars and at least three shallow areas for younger kids who don't swim yet. The swimming area has happy hour (2 for 1 drinks) from 11:00 to 1:00 each day. They also have a drink tasting on some of the days at the pool which can be fun. The palapas do tend to get filled up early by people going out around 6:00 am to claim one (even earlier on the weekends). The beach area is very wide. It is hard though to get into the water direcly at this beach due to the rocks. We did walk about 15-20 minutes to the north and found and incredible swimming area. The restaurants at this property are also good. We were surprised that even the room service was good even sometimes better than the food that we had at the pool area. We ate one dinner at the Del Lago restaurant which is a buffet. The food was good and they also had a good singer on 4 or 5 evenings. The restaurant by the beach was also good. The Tramonto restaurant, which is the expensive one, is very good and very well worth the money. We also at several lunches at the pool which gets its food from the Blanche restaurant. All together we ate 5 dinners, 4 lunches and 2 breakfasts plus several happy hour drinks and our final bill was about $800 US for the four of us. The property is doing construction on building more pools and more covered areas. We didn't find the noise to be loud at all and our room partially overlooked the construction. I would love to go back to this property after all the construction is completed on the additional pools to see them. The only negative that we had was that they shut down the power one day to the building that our room (not any other building) was in due to construction being done at the property. We were told of this the night before, however, they told us that it was only going to last 5 hours. Because we knew the power was going to be out we spent the afternoon away from the room. When we got back, the power still wasn't back on even though it was one hour past the time that they said it would be on. We then went out to dinner and when we came back it was still out. After my husband went to complain about the lack of communication on the extended power outage the did credit us 50% of our dinner that evening as we couldn't cook anything in the room since we had no power. All together the power was out for about 10-11 hours. The next day the managers also left fruit plates in all of the affected rooms as an apology.

First, we had a very nice time and the people of the resort and throughout the region were friendly and welcoming. The town of Playa Del Carmen is delightful with many shops and eating establishments. The WalMart and Mega Stores were clean and fairly well stocked with the items typically required for your stay at the Grand Mayan resort. Taxi's are available as you exit the stores and will take you back to the resort, which we found to be easier than taking the bus with our purchases. The taxi fare to or from Playa is $18 US with bus fares being anywhere from $1 to $2 US. We also went to the town of Puerto Morelos for dinner and the taxi fare is $8 US each way. There are several dining facilities located on or near the beach and the service was excellent. The downtown area itself consists of a town square where the residents gather and there were several small shops but they closed at 8 pm. We ate at Pelicano's and the seafood was excellent and the servcie superb. Now for the Grand Mayan. The rooms were fabulous, but you need to make sure that you are in a building close to the activities (pool), otherwise you need to take the shuttle or it is anywhere from a 10 to 20 minute walk. Dining - The food was good but somewhat expensive, but remember they have you captive unless you are willing to leave the grounds by bus or taxi. Pool - The pool was extraordinary and very well maintained. The huts and pool chairs fill up very quickly, with most huts occupied by 6 or 6:30 each morning (yes people go out as early as 4 am and sleep for a few hours) and the chairs occupied by 9 or 10 am. Beach - The beach was nice, but as everyone says you cannot even think of going into the water due to the rocky bottom. If you want to go in the water from the beach I suggest you spend the day in Playa where you can rent chairs and an umbrella for a few dollars. Entertainment - Other than the Mexican review, the entertainment is very poor and not worth the time or money. Timeshare Presentation - they promise you it only takes 90 minutes but if you do it expect 4 hours of intense sales pressure, The do provide you breakfast, which was very good, and give you a $50 room credit and 10% off all purchases so make your own choice. If you tell them at check-in when they approach you that you are not interested they will leave you alone. Overall - The resort was very nice but isolated from off-site activities.

We were away from the resort most days from morning to evening. We used the warmest pool at night with the stars above (romantic). Everything we read about the resort on this site has been accurate. I learned a few things that I want to share. Only Building 4 is desginated as Non-Smoking. We checked in late on Saturday night and could have had a 2 bedroom, non-smoking overlooking the golf course. But he main road in and out of the resort is between Bldg 4 (and Bldg 3) and the golf course. I wanted a lagoon view, so I took a smoking room in Bldg 2. The odor in the livingroom was pretty strong, but the bedrooms did not smell bad, so we did OK. The construction is on the back side of Bldgs 1 and 2. The back sides of Bldgs 5, 6 and 7 overlook construction of the neighboring property. We spent mornings and evenings on our deck (patio) - so I was happy with the peaceful lagoon view. (I think the Friday check-in people get the best choices - they assign rooms on the day of check-in, not in advance) Opening the sliding doors helped with the odor, but here are no screen doors. You have to pay to use the gym, even if you were RCI ($10 per day). There are no paper towels provided. The water is fine to drink from the tap. We drank it all week, no one got sick. Blanca is not open as long of hours as before. The new Havana Moon restaurant is open late and is nice. They have a dance floor and live music some nights. Walmart and the Mega Mart are several blocks off the highway. You do save money, but they are not real easy to get to. I paid $1.00 for a quart box of milk at Walmart, $1.30 for milk at 7-11 (or OXOX Mart) and it was $2.30 for a quart of milk at the resort. So if you just need milk, how bad do you want to save $1.00? They do not sell bread or cereal at 7-11. The food and drinks at the resort are a little over priced. But I looked at the Room Service menu. I did not order anything, but the prices on it were really reasonable. $6.50 for two eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast (available 24 hours). I paid the same at Denny's. We really had a fun vacation.

There is so much to tell about the area that I cannot got into detail, but there is so much to see and do in the immediate area during the day hours, and Playa de Carmen does have some decent bars and clubs for the night life, not like cancun but that will soon change with a rumor of Coco Bongo opening up in Playa de Carmen, a must for the young crowd!!!!!

As most of the others that posted reviews, I was a constant visitor to this site before we left and wanted to add my comments to the others. We had a one bedroom condo booked through our RCI timeshare. The condo was wonderful, full kitchen with anything we needed, a great deck with a cooling pool and a TV in each room. We took our 17 year old son and his girlfriend and they had a great time. The people at the resort treated them like adults (which was fine as this is how we treat them) and they never complained about anything. The one complaint I had was with the beds around the pool. It looked like most people got there long before 6 am to reserve their spot and then never returned until long after 9. I checked with the security and they don't start monitoring until 7:30 and they give everyone 90 minutes to occupy the beds before you can ask that their stuff is removed. Kind of maddening for the people that actually want to come down and lay around the pool at 8 in the morning. In the end, it wasn't that big a deal, there is lots of shade around the pool so we were able to keep from getting a sunburn. The beach restaurant was completed just prior to our arrival so we had the choice of 4 restaurants, the buffet (which we only went to for breakfast once), the pool restaurant (we ate here a lot), the fancy restaurant upstairs (ate here once) and the beach restaurant (ate here quite a bit also). The food at all the places was great, not any more than we would pay in Canada for the same food and the service was great (only had one waiter that wasn't in a great mood, but I think that was New Year's Eve so who would be happy to be working). I agree that the ocean swimming at the resort is not the best. My son is trying to perfect body surfing and was disappointed that he couldn't spend time in the ocean. We did walk up the beach about 5 minutes and found a place where it was good to go in, but as he was the only one really interested in it we didn't make the trek again. The pool is amazing, lots of room and 2 swim up bars. We did rent a car and go to Playa del Carmen and Tulum. The car was handy. I prefer not to be on someone else's schedule and liked to be able to go to Tulum on our own time. As another reviewer wrote, we signed up with Edventures just outside the gates of Tulum and they took us cave snorkelling at Dos Ojtes (I think that is the correct spelling), snorkelling with the turtles at Akumel and snorkelling in a lagoon at Yel Ku. It was nice because none of these places were super busy. I would recommend this type of tour but only if you don't mind changing in outdoor toilets. We also did the Discover Scuba encounter at the resort. It was our last day and the ocean was really rough. We did get to go out and dive, but didn't go as deep as most would in this type of activity. Okay with me, I just wanted to try the scuba thing and the fact that I could get to the top in less than 5 minutes was good by me. Others have said that the beds were hard, we didn't have any complaints, neither did the kids and they slept on the two couch beds in the living room. We ate a few breakfasts in our room (groceries from Walmart) but with everything all in for the 4 of us the bill was around $2,900 including purchases at the gift shop, jet ski rentals, food and drinks for 4 adults for the week (we ate a couple of meals in Playa del Carmen), golf at the resort and the discover scuba lessons for 3 adults. I didn't find this excessive when compared to the all inclusive fee we would have had to pay for one of the Palance resorts especially given the extras that we added on. The resort is large, but it wasn't that long a walk to the pool (we were in building 2) and our balcony faced the lagoon so it was nice and quite. They are doing construction on the way to the pool but it never interferred with our enjoyment of the resort in any way. I would recommend the resort and would return there again however on my next trip to that area, I would stay closer to Akumel as it seemed there was better snorkelling and the beaches were a bit more protected for swimming in the ocean.", "Date": "January 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cHighly Recommend\u201d", "Author": "SimDen", "ReviewID": "UR6599149", "Content": "We just got back from a one week (Jan 5-12) stay at the Grand Mayan Riviera. I would like to preface this synopsis with a comment that although I always read these reviews, I have never felt strongly enough until now to write one. However, given our experience, I felt it necessary to give this resort the respect it deserves. My husband, daughter (7 months) and myself went with another couple and their 9 month old daughter. I would highly recommend this place for anyone at any age range. It was incredible. I will comment on the following items: Room: We stayed in the 2 bedroom/2 bathroom with a living room,kitchen,dinging area. This room was incredibly spacious and both families could have their own privacy and never felt on top of each other. The decor was modern and clean. The bathrooms were beautiful with Jacuzzi and separate showers. The kitchen had everything you needed ( we cooked almost every night because we stayed in with the babies) and if we wanted anything extra (e.g., another knife, bigger bowls etc) we just requested this and it was brought to us immediately. Service: I cannot comment enough on the service at this resort. I have never had such great service at any point in my traveling experience - and I have traveled all over the world. If we wanted anything at all - no request was too great and it was completed in record time. Not only was the request completed, but after each request, the operator would call back to make sure that we got what was requested, that we are satisfied and to know if there was anything else they could do for us to make our stay more pleasant. Even something as small as an extra knife seemed important to them. Food: As I mentioned earlier, we cooked most of our dinners in the room just because of the babies. However we ate breakfast at the buffet twice, our lunches by the pool, room-service once and dinner out once. The breakfast buffet was incredible. Although it was expensive - there was so much to offer and you could eat enough that lunch was not required. The poolside food was also amazing. Hamburgers, Fajitas, sandwiches, pizza etc. it was all great and well worth the prices (which I found to be very affordable). There was also a health-food restaurant in the gym and you could order poolside off that menu. Amazing smoothies and fresh juices, great sandwiches and muffins. We went one night to the restaurant on the beach - the food was good but I heard that the other restaurant (Tramonto - excuse spelling???) was much better. Pool: Warm, huge, beautiful and well kept. There were two swim-up bars, 3 separate levels of connected pools with two children's pools inside and areas where you could lye on a raised surface inside the water. The beds by the pool were the best feature. They were so comfortable and the shade they provided under the Thatch roof was incredible. If you got there by 6:30am you could usually always find one and it was worth getting up for. Beach - We did not go into the ocean, but the beach itself was very well kept. We did bring ocean shoes just in case. Activities: They had activities for all age ranges. The children were kept entertained by the staff playing games in one area while the adults were kept entertained in a separate area. Bugs- Mosquitoes only in the evening. I would recommend bug spray Noise: I did not hear noise from other rooms like others complained about. I also never heard construction noise at the pool or in our room. If we walked by an area of construction I could hear trucks - but that is it. Construction - not a big deal Power supply - we did bring a power bar because someone else complained about the lack of outlets - but this also wasn't such a big issue. Walk to the pool - we stayed in building 4. It took us 5 minutes to walk to the pool. This was something that others complained about a lot and again, I found this to be a non-issue as well. Resort size: Although it is big, we did not find it overwhelming. The shuttle service was incredible and well organized. Renting a car: We rented one from the airport because we knew we were going to be grocery shopping and going to Tulum for the day. I recommend it. It was a nice perk. As I said before, This hotel is great for anyone. If you are dating, single, 5 years old or 60 years old - I recommend. The service is excellent and the accommodations are beautiful. I highly recommend.", "Date": "January 15, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "The Grand Mayan Riviera Maya", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d569579-Reviews-The_Grand_Mayan_Riviera_Maya-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$122 - $237*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Km 48 Carretera Federal</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "569579", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/a3/4e/a34edbbb650f5d308dbb121183aaf2ec3large.jpg"}}
