Got a great deal on Netflights. I agree with other reviews that say this hotel is somewhat dated and needs a refurb. The room was clean but hallways were tired and carpets worn. Good facilities including free wi fi. We ate in the main resturant twice and the food was ok. The Deli provides good value for money snacks and beverages. We used the pool one of which was heated One thing i really must complain about is the so called transportation to Universal Studios/Seaworld.The hotel offerred one bus to Universal, the same one also stopping at Seaworld the morning journey on the bus was very cramped and uncomfortable cramming people into every gap available, not good for a 20 min+ journey. The return journey was even worse with what i would consider to be an illegal overcrowding to the point that the rear suspension on the transport failed after leaving Seaworld leaving us on the side of the road for 40 minutes whilst a new bus was sought. The security staff at Seaworld commented that it was extremley overloaded. and the police were also called to the incident, not good when you have two young children and 90 degree heat. I appreciate the transport is complimentary but the hotel has a duty of care to its guests when offering services, guests also commented that the buses were crammed the previous day as well. I would be interested to hear what the Raddison did to address this as it was raised as an issue with the management upon our return to the hotel. Overall hotel was fine for a few nights but i would not stay there again if looking to use park shuttle facilities", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tallahassee, Florida", "Title": "\u201cNOt a long term saty but you cannot beat the rates\u201d", "Author": "WolfTravler", "ReviewID": "UR126101170", "Content": "The accessibility to Disney property, and the US 192 attractions make this an OK stay.

Its definitely gonna be long. Phewww I planned my trip to Disney in December and surely I didn't plan in advance so I had not many options. When I started to explore all the websites to book a decent budget hotel and unfortunately I didn't have many options. I read all the bad reviews but still I was positive that its from the Ramada Group and should have some basic facilities with professional staff. Boy.....I was wrong. The most horrible thing which I experienced were the staff (horrible attitude, liars, unprofessional, and some of the housekeeping had difficulty understanding English) After booking online I called them well in advance and asked if I can request for microwave and refrigerator since I need them badly b'coz I was travelling with a small kid (they don't have them in room and they provide @$5 each per night) and got the response from their staff that you don't need to worry and we have them in plenty so not a problem. I trusted them and not even carried my small microwave with me in my car. When I reached there around 8:00 pm I was told \"no refrigerator and microwave available\" and when I told them I spoke to a lady and she told me it would be available and then immediately that guy asked what was the name of that person and I was shocked to see their attitude. Our trip was spoiled at that particular moment. When we entered in the room, the room was bit smelly so I switched on the AC. That was working fine luckily :) Then we switched on our laptop but realized that we are not able to get the internet connection. We tried to call the front desk....no body picked up the phone so my husband went personally to the front desk twice if they can do something for the internet connection. Not much help except the password they provided. Any ways we were without internet for 4 days there. Luckily we had our GPS and we didn't have any problem finding the desired destination. My husband went to nearest walmart to buy a small microwave so our daughter can have some food and milk. When I put my daughter in bed I realized that the bed sheets has not been changed and their so called blanket which they provided were smelly and had plenty of hair. I felt like crying and returning back home. I called their housekeeping and asked them to explain and to change. But they said they don't have any more blanket....they will be getting them tomorrow. They can provide some extra sheets. She changed the bedsheets and gave 2 extra white bedsheets instead blanket. I got the room where I had no bath tub. I thought They don't have bathtub in any room. But next day when I came out of my room to ask the housekeeping to vacuum my room, I found out the next door room had bathtub and I was so pissed. I called them to ask why they didn't give me room with bathtub when they also know that we are travelling with a kid and how am I suppose to give her bath in shower. She was so scared. Same answer......You should have requested. Bathroom was so dirty that when I switched on the shower the hot water and mold on the shower curtain created some kind of toxic smell. We were only provided 1 bath towel initially and I can't explain the size of the bath towel. It was so short. One funny thing I want to share with you...when we reached there we felt a big sticky spot near the staircase (may be Pepsi or some spill) and they didn't clean that for next four days. it was so sticky and just next ro the staircase....no one could miss, how come they ignored?? Hotel construction is old.... expectable. But this kind of attitude.....unimaginable The hotel was dirty, filthy, rude, irresponsibly lazy staff, spider webs........etc By this second day....I started to get used to their attitude and expected nothing at all from them and with a different attitude headed for Disney and returned back only at 12:00 pm just to sleep. But I had great experience in Disney.....I wish I would have stayed in some other decent hotel.....this trip would have been WOW", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "South Florida, Florida", "Title": "\u201cI Don't Agree with All the Negative Reviews\u201d", "Author": "yvonne_and_gus", "ReviewID": "UR107731462", "Content": "My husband and I were in town for a dog show.

When we started the drive from Miami to Orlando, I took the time to check out all the reviews on Trip Advisor and almost canceled my reservation because I was so discouraged by all the negative comments/reviews that had been posted. I called the hotel and spoke with Penny at the front desk. I explained to her my concerns and she assured me that we would not experience any issues during our stay. Traveling with very large show dogs is not easy, so I trusted her assurances and arrived at the hotel. I had reserved a VIP King Suite and when I arrived the room was ready for check in. It was huge. 1200+ square feet with kitchenette, dining room, living room, 2 full bathrooms and a bedroom. The room was impeccable. Very clean, very well kept. I am a hotel snob and I felt that the reviews in no way fairly represented my stay at this hotel. I was there for 3 nights and aside from 1 little hiccup - that was promptly taken care of - our stay was perfect. Everyone was courteous. The lobby bar was great for having a beer or glass of wine before heading out. The hotel is located in an area that is full of restaurants extremely close and there was ample parking on the grounds. I highly recommend this hotel and suggest that if you are concerned about staying here because of the reviews - call first, speak with Penny or Joe the manager - and give them a chance to prove the reviews wrong.

I thought this was an amazing deal. I booked through Travelocity's hot deal category. The name of the hotel is kept secret. It was only $25. You get what you pay for goes with this review. This hotel was formally a Ramada hotel. This is no longer the case. The lobby and internet pictures were very deceiving. At first glance it looked very nice. The room had two double beds. My husband described sleeping on it like \"sleeping on a saltine cracker.\" The carpets were dirty. The walls were dirty. There were no bathtubs. They only gave you two towels ... we had to ask for more, and the light fixtures did not work. Now on to customer service, we called ahead of time to see if the reviews we read were true ... \"Michelle\" assured us that things have been taken care of and not to worry. We got there only to find no lighting, two towels, and when we went to call the front desk the phone did not work. My husband went to the front office to get more towels and let them know about the phone. They young man with slicked back hair didn't even know where to find towels.

It took 4 hours, 4 phone calls to the front desk, and a trip to the front desk to get it resolved. During those calls we were not offered any compensation and told that we were \"just unlucky\" with our safe and were out of luck. Every day, the housekeeping came and took our towels. Some days they replaced them, some not. Some days they took all but one of the dirty towels and gave us no clean towels. There were 3 people in our room, which they knew. I had something stolen from the room one day. Another day, only one of the beds was made. I'm fully capable of making a bed, but it had better be done for me if I have to pay for it.

We took our suitcases back out to the car and weent back to the front desk and asked for a different room, when I explined what the problem was the girl never said anything she just gave me a new room key and told me where the room was, no sorrry no nothing. Well room number two wasn't a whole lot better, but at least it didn't smell and the air conditioner wasn't as loud but it was just the begining of a stay at this dump. The bathroom had mold groing in the shower (no bathtub), the soaps looked as though they had been rolling around in a box for years, the shampoo may have been left by previous guests or just plain refilled. Had a king size bed with unfitted sheets that barely fit the bed, and two blankets that barely fit the bed as well. We didn't get any sleep at all because the walls were so thin you could hear everything in the room next door and across the hall, baby crying all night next door and a tv blasting across the hall all night. We thought we would go take a swim but after looking at the pool I figured this was not a good idea, there was something black growing on the edge of the pool and the bottom was filthy, it had bad written all over it. The business center is joke! what hotel charges you .25 cents minute to use a computer? To add insult to injury when trying to print our airplane boarding passes wee had to pay .75 cents a page to print them and the printer didn't work correctly and had to TRY to get someone down there to fix it and of course cost more money becuse the clock was ticking on the on the minutes purchased to use there computer.

We've stayed at luxury resorts but most often find ourselves in a name brand value hotel to save the $$ for fun. That being said, we\"ve been burned by \"deals\" on Expedia for rooms in this category sight unseen. We made a list of some options and went to FL with no reservations. After arriving on 192 we checked out some of the options. We also used the Unofficial Guide to Disney's list of Top 30 hotel values. That is how we arrived at the Ramada. Ironically we have driven by it a hundred times before and never gave it a second thought. The Expedia rate was $37 and the walk in rate was $38. Expedia also offered free breakfast every day as a bonus. Before booking we asked to see the room we would be aasigned if we stayed. Good thing to ask because they want you to stay so will show you a good room. We took the room but opted for the walk in rate rather than Expedia to avoid the 2 hour lag of processing the reservation online. Here is what we got: The property was deserted for such a large property. Most people were off to the parks and there were a few small conferences being held there. The lobby and common areas were very clean and the staff friendly. They even delivered a fridge and microwave (spotlessly clean) to our room at no extra charge. We arrived at our room through an interior hallway. The room was roomy and very clean. It was in a non smoking building. The ac worked well. There were not enough towels for 4 but the housekeeping staff just gave us a stack of more towels. There was shampoo, soap, tissues, mouthwash and body lotion on the sink along with tissues and extra toilet paper. The beds were comfortable(pillows and mattresses on the soft side) and came with no gross bedcover. There were soft sheets and a cotton blanket. Again, everything was very clean. Behind furniture and under things were also clean. The room also had ample lighting and closet/drawer space for a family of 4. The table and chairs were great for eating meals and working on the laptop (free wifi). The bathroom was also clean and consisted of a separate vanity/dressing area and then the bath/shower. There was no tub, only a stall shower. There was a spot of rust on the bottom of the door frame where the shower must leak out if the curtain is not closed. there were also a few spots on the towel bar (pea sized spots). After unpacking we headed out to the pool. It was clean, neat and had plenty of seating/lounges. The lounge chairs under the trees were not as clean as the ones not under the trees. The pool and deck were maintained well. The pool had a deep section as well as stairs and a railing to enter the shallow end. There was a lip all around the pool. Towels were provided at the pool. Check out was easy. Taxes and resort fees added $12 to the $38 room rate; typical at most of the hotels. It was still a great value. One of the best parts was the ultra convenience of being on 192 near everything. If you don't have a car, you won't find it as convenient. With a car, grocery, restaurants, pharmacies, etc. are 5 minutes away. And of course the most important factor is just how close it was to the Disney gate. We were going under the Welcome to Disney World arch in 5-7 minutes. We would definitely come back here again. Just so you know....I don't know what makes it a resort. we've stayed in many resorts and all that is here is a pool.

We chose the Ramada Celebration Resort, and stayed for a total of about $50/night for 4 nights. I don't think I would have paid more than that. The hotel is clean, and safe, and the staff was very pleasant, so all that was fine, it was just all the little things added together...the hotel seems pretty old, and could use a bit of a rehab. The shower we had in our room was a hand-held sprayer in a holder, and it wouldn't sit upright in the holder, so you had to take a shower with one hand!!! I had a headband with me, thank GOD that I used to jerry rig the nozzle head to get it to sit upright so I could shower with 2 hands. We were also supposed to get a courtyard facing room, but had a parking lot view. I didn't think it was a huge deal when we got in the first night, so didn't alert staff and request a room change, but we could hear a lot of noise from the nearby highway pretty much all night, so a courtyard facing room would have been better. After the first night, we were always up early and in bed late, so I never did take it up with the staff re: switching rooms because we didn't have time! Shuttles/Transport: We didn't rent a car, since we didn't really need one (we were only doing the Disney parks), so we took a cab from the Orlando airport to the hotel, and back to the airport and that cost $55 plus tip each way. The shuttles to and from the Disney parks were nice. We took the earliest shuttle to Magic Kingdom every morning, and then caught a bus from Magic Kingdom to whatever park we wanted to go to (they run about every 15-20 minutes, so we didn't have to wait long once we got to Magic Kingdom). The evening shuttles are a little tricky during the week (that may just be in January, too, since it's the off season)- there was only one that left Thursday night from Magic Kingdom to take us back to the hotel, and it was about 15 minutes after the fireworks ended, so we had to hustle to get to the parking lot. And the shuttle that left Hollywood Studios one night left at 8:55 and the park closed at 7:00!! But there were always enough seats, and the drivers were pretty nice. At night this hotel was usually the last stop on the shuttle route, so plan on getting home late! Food: Breakfast during the week at the Paradise Cafe was pretty good- for $4.95 each we got the Continental Buffet (cold cereal, bagels/muffins/danishes, fruit, coffee and juice), which was pretty reasonable, I thought (especially for Orlando!) or on the weekends for $9.95 you can get the Hot Buffet instead, with pancakes and bacon, eggs etc. We ate a late dinner one night at the Market Place and Deli, and their food was really good, and the staff was really nice. Amenities: The in-room safe was nice, and easy to use. We never did try out the tennis courts or fitness room, and it was too cold for the outdoor pool. Don't be fooled by the business center- you have to pay $.25/minute for internet time and $.75/page to print anything out. We flew Southwest, so had to pay like $4 total to check in online and print our boarding passes. I thought that was included in the $10/night resort fee we paid, but nope! It's extra! So, overall, we feel we got what we paid for, and we are glad that we only paid 1/2 price. It was clean, no fear of bugs or weird stains on the sheets or anything, and the staff was nice, but it wasn't a great stay. If you're expecting a resort-like atmosphere, stay somewhere else! Neither of us could imagine paying more for this hotel. We both thought next time we stay in Orlando, we will stay at one of the Disney hotels just to make it easier to get to the parks, plus when you purchase anything at any of the parks, they will send it to your hotel room for you when you stay at the Disney hotels, which we thought was awesome, plus if you stay with them, you can access the parks for more hours.

The first night, we were pleasantly surprised by the room. I was prepared with multiple candles and air sprays; however, our room (room 3911) did not have a smell to it. I do agree that they do not provide enough blankets. The review would have been glowing had it not been for the event listed below. The second night, we came home from Disney to music from the convention center. We heard music because our sliding glass doors were situation literally right outside the bay doors of their convention center. We left Disney early (around 11), so I figured there was a wedding/party reception. We were understanding of it, so we let it be. By midnight, the music became louder, the doors of the convention center were opened constantly, so I called front desk. They said it would be a few minutes. By 1 lack of sleep made me dress and go to the front desk. There, I asked if they can turn down the music. A manager, who was standing at the front counter, said \"the concert\" will last until 2. The concert?!? Ok, moving on. I asked, so we are stuck with this music right outside of our door until 2am? The management just shrugged. A shrug was an unacceptable answer, so I asked for the corporate number. It was not until I did that, that he offered to move our rooms for an upgrade fee (they didn't have the same room we were in). I told him I don't agree with the upgrade fee, but he just shrugged. We also were informed we would have to check out of our old room to get a new room. I figure, we could leave our stuff in the room we were settled it, and sleep in another room. I have a problem with this since they knew a concert was happening and we could have been booked another room at check-out. When we did check-out, we were handed a sheet of paper, and the front desk clerk literally turned and walked away. All she said was, \"What was your room number?\" It was not until another clerk friendly as can be informed me that was all.

He offered to comp breakfast the next morning, but \"renegged\" after our team had eaten and said he would cover half! We had toilets that leaked, no towels (or at least not enough, no washclothes or hand towels), blankets the thickness of a table cloth, and no one would answer the front desk phone....at one point it rang for three minutes before someone answered. The odd thing is that on New Years Eve the hotel had a full staff and a full parking lot .....they seemed to have been able to accommodate everyone! While standing in line on the 28th they were turning away guests who had booked on Travelocity -- apparently the rooms were guaranteed through Travelocity, but the Ramada said they were not guaranteed through the hotel....how ridiculous, if Travelocity has bookings with the hotel then the Ramada is obviously contracting with them and the rooms should be guaranteed. Finally the reason the hotel manager, Jeff Howard, knew nothing about the situation was because the staff were instructed not to contact him. We have had better service and accommodations at a Motel 6 or Holiday Inn for half the rate. Mr. Howard, our entire team was INCONVENIENCED as we all came three days early and paid for your crappy hotel and rental cars and reserved soccer fields that we could not use because most of our team was exhausted from having to wait in line for over an hour (at midnight) just to get a room....with spiders, ants, no towels, bad plumbing, etc!

Rooms were cleaned every day, maids made a real effort in keeping clean, great attention to detail with towels and beds and even folding up your PJ's! free complimentary shower/shampoos daily/ coffee machine in room. On second day we got delivered a fridge without asking, so that was nice. Mattesses looked new really thick and comfy. Rooms are not decorated like 5 star luxury, but remember you are not paying 5 star prices. Free wi-fi which worked all the time in rooms and bar and lobby. Staff very friendly. Who goes on holiday to work out anyway?? Gym looked fine to use. Has own gift shop and market place food deli which is open till late to get your late nights snacks. Bonkerz comedy club in hotel is worth going to, very funny great comedians. You get free shuttle to Epcot in mornings then from Epcot you can catch Disneys free transport to other parks. This changed on our last day and I now think there are 3 times in the morning to go to three park drop off and three times in evening you can catch the shuttle back. Much improved service. If you do not have a hire car ask for a room near lobby we asked and got one no problems. Free continental breakfast is included which is ur usual cereal, bagels, pastries, fresh fruit salad, toast. But you can upgrade to $5 per person for a hot. My only negative comment about this hotel is the hot breakfast, this for me is the only area that needs improving, but not too much of a big deal as you have lots of other restaurants to chose from nearby. Old town is well worth a look and if you want to be gobsmacked a drive through Celebration town is a must, absolutely beautiful and only 5 mins drive from hotel! there is a shuttle service called fun spot shuttle which wil pick you up from your hotel and take you anywhere one the 192 for free!! you dont just have to go to fun spot! Just give them a dollar tip at the end, we used this on the last day as only found out about it last day but what a great service!

We booked this property via Hotwire for $33 per room per night ($47 with taxes and junk fees) and we booked two rooms total. Obviously, the price was nice, but we still felt baited and switched. But first, let's mention the positive: the rooms were perfectly adequate, the beds were very comfortable, the gym was good for a property at its level (I'm a workout addict) and the staff was largely pleasant to deal with. Sleep was quiet and undisturbed. However, on the negative side, despite my booking via Hotwire (which is supposed to be 100% prepaid, barring incidentals like phone calls and on-site dining) the property decided to charge me some previously undisclosed fees: $5 (plus tax) per car for parking (which is OK in a downtown area but on a sprawling property next to the interstate? C'mon!) and another $5 per room (again, plus tax) as a \"resort fee.\" Needless to say, I began the stay feeling ripped off, which isn't a good way to make your guests happy, and I've complained to Hotwire about that too. The price should be the price, and any mandatory extras should be fully disclosed online. Finally, Hotwire represented this property as a three-star. Now, in my experience a three-star is a building where the lobby can be reached from a guest room via an elevator ride (i.e. \"minimal full-service\" like Holiday Inn and Radisson). In this case the rooms were in clusters of 20 or so, in two-story buildings spread throughout the property and exterior stairways. To get to the lobby from nearly any room was a serious hike -- that's a two-star motel to me, not a three-star hotel property. On top of that, the guest areas needed work -- lots of scuffing, missing paint and needed maintenance. Bottom line: had it been two-star rated, and had I not been charged the extra rip-off fees, I would have been perfectly happy with the stay.
