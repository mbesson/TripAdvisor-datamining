It's a nice place, very clean and simple (in a good way). Great location for shopping and sightseeing. We had a standard room and it was good enough. Not much furniture in the room, pillows stuffed with something strange (ok to sleep on though), noisy when you open the window that faces a busy street - that's about all the disadvantages i noticed. On the plus side: - GREAT location. Bus no.109 takes you from the Tegel airport almost to the doors of the hotel. It's a 5-minute walk from a subway station (Uhlandstrasse), the Zoo and the subway/bus/train station are a 20-minute walk away or you can take a bus. The buses no.100 and 200 which stop there are great for a small sightseeing tour of the city, you get to see the Parliament, Brandenburger Tor, the famous Unter den Linden shopping street, the Berliner Dom within a 40-minute drive - not too noisy - good breakfast. Don't let the other reviews scare you - the \"strange\" things the restaurant offers for breakfast are just chicken nuggets or small pizzas, just choose something else as there is plenty to choose from - very clean - unconventional design that's not too over-the-top. There was only a picture of some director in our room (didn't look very convincing), lots of posters and pictures around the hotel create a nice mood - the Italian restaurant is charming and serves great food Almost forgot a major minus - there's no free Internet in the rooms, you have to pay 2 euros an hour for a connection or use the computer that's in the lobby (rarely free).

FYI...if your young and into clubs like me, you may have to take a sky train a few stops to get to the area of the best clubs. I found perhaps the BEST club that everybody goes to but is not advertised. It was the sickest party i've ever experienced and it started Friday night and continued until Sunday afternoon...they pull shades over the windows during the day to keep the light out. email me for details. ROOM: Super clean and nicely appointed. Wifi (you must pay extra for) in the room and the standard desk, chairs and television. The bed was nice and comfortable with nice soft blankets and lines. Each room is themed after some old Hollywood startlet or legend and their is a picture outside the door of the chosen celebrity. One tip however....make SURE you request a room away from the street. Unfortunately, my room was on the street side and it is a bit noisy throughout the night and early morning due to honks and horns. FOOD: One of the best things about Hollywood Media Hotel is the awesome buffet breakfast!! Make sure that breakfast is included in your room rate, or else you will be left out in the cold. Nice breakfast hours too, for those of us who like to sleep in late. Approx. from 6:30am to 10am, there is a huge assortment of breads, pastries, yougurts, juices, fruits, coffee, plus pancakes, scrambled eggs, bacon, etc. Keep in mind, the breakfast room seems to fill up rather quickly, so you may want to target your breakfast for either 6:30am (right when they open up) or towards the tail end of the morning around 9:30am (before they close)....these seem to be the best times to avoid the crowds. LOCATION: As mentioned earlier, location couldn't be any better!! Situated right next to a Burger King, with all kinds of cool shops and boutiques around. About a 7 - 10 minute walk from the Zoo subway stop. (one of the main stops in Berlin). Overalll, Berlin is a city that really rocks and is alive with youth, energy and a vibrant spirit.

It has some bars that are located just around the corner, and all party life and more bars, are literally a few stops away on the tube \u2013 (which is 24hr) Just a short walk away was a great American Diner, \u2018Route 66\u2019 \u2013 A great place to eat, real value for money. I went to Berlin for my 18th, as part of my travelling ventures. There were people of all ages on this trip with me, and the hotel staff catered for all. Giving us directions for the night life alongside discounts for clubs, they helped with finding our way to shopping places and all tourist attractions. The staff spoke very good English. Due to bad weather, we stayed in the hotel bar, it was brilliant - Open all night, and small snacks brought to your table. My mother booked this through GTAhotels.com website \u2013 there was a slight mishap when arriving to the hotel, they hadn\u2019t received confirmation from the Hotel booking company \u2013 However, the staff efforts were outstanding to get us our rooms, even late at night and without receiving any confirmation, nor money. It was sorted the morning after.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wales", "Title": "\u201cTop Hotel\u201d", "Author": "mellyb1962", "ReviewID": "UR10503143", "Content": "Just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hollywood Media Hotel.

The rooms are decent sized (for Europe) and the hotel has a gym and solarium (which are small but at least they ahve them). The biggest problem I had was when I checked out a day early. Our company had reserved at least 20 rooms for nearly a week. I had changed my reservation to arrive a day earlier and also check out a day earlier. However, when I went to check out, they still charged me for the extra day when I did not stay. It was most likely miscommunication between my corporate travel agent but I was pretty shocked that they were so strict - espcially since I had arrived a day earlier and also because my company had give them quite a bit of business.

Say you were an opera buff and one of your clients mistakenly assumed you liked hard rock concerts and took you to one. You would necessarily put a brave face to what it might turn out to be the most excruciating couple of hours of your life, you may even - if you are so brave - pretend to know something about the band that was playing, but in the end you would certainly be glad to get back to your pad and the first thing you'd do (once you regained your hearing) would be to reach for your collection of opera CDs, playing your favourite piece to restore your inner balance. This is exactly the trouble with the Hollywood Media Hotel. If you are a movies buff you are in your element. If, like me, you just watch movies but couldn't give a hoot about actors, actresses and the fickle world of celluloid, then you would be somewhat less appreciative of this hotel's main features. But let's face it, themed hotels belong to theme parks and although some of our most touristy cities in the world may very well be on the verge of turning into branches of the Disney corporation, I have fortunately failed to notice the presence of hotels pretending to have a locally related theme in all of them, let alone the theme of a place thousand of miles from where you are staying. So, the Hollywood Media Hotel can only get away with its theme in a quirky city like Berlin, and in the middle of the Ku'Damm and right next door to a fast food joint, just to add to the authenticity of all that is gimmicky and tacky. By now, you are either completely turned off and are seeking another hotel, or you are desperate to know more about this place. Let's say that its main feature is the Hollywood posters, plastered on every inch of available space around the public areas. Large chandeliers and various other props add to the phoney effect and greet you on arrival (or was it the staff?). If you had a long flight you may be rudely awaken by all these of images screaming for attention, which is exactly what cinema posters are supposed to do. The short trip to your room through the labyrinthine corridors garishly furnished with more posters, and a carpet reminding you of the hotel name around every corner, takes to what is a total contrast to the rest of this establishment, since the rooms are surprisingly and disappointingly bland. Just when you had resigned (or fired) yourself to the idea that for one night or two you were going to move into a Hollywood set, you are instead rudely projected back to the reality of basic 4 star hotels and are therefore returned to galaxy blandness. (There must be a college somewhere for interior designers specialising in this kind of decor - if anyone knows I would be grateful for the information!) With the only exception of a picture of the thespian to whom the room is dedicated to (did I forget to mention that?), there is absolutely nothing else in your room to even hint that you are staying in a themed hotel. In fact, there is little else to remind you that you are staying in a 4 star hotel, since the hotel management has seen it fit to diligently remove every single item of complimentary toiletries from the bathroom, but saying thatm should you feel the urge to get a toothpaste, they would be delighted to offer it to you if you visited reception. How many people may actually bother to ask for their basket of goodies is unknown to me. If you are like me and you'd rather brush your teeth with the soap out of the dispenser, before having to dress up again to get a few floors down to reception to ask for some toothpaste, I suspect the hotel manages to save quite a lot of money with this stunt. Did I omit to say there is of course a bed, a table, a TV and the rest of the stuff you'd normally associate with a hotel room? I am sorry. Of course you do get all that and you don't even have to go down to reception to ask for it. Was the room clean? Certainly. Was the bathroom OK? Well, yes and no, the shower in my room was powerful enough, but the water took ages to drain, which is a sure symptom of either dodgy plumbing or of a blockage with unspeakable remains of previous guests. I promise you, however, that I failed to ascertain which of these options it was, deciding to leave this pleasure to the next guest. Breakfast is served in a large factory like space with rows of tables and chairs and I have to admit you are spoilt for choice and it's on par with any other 4 star hotels around, so full marks here. Would I recommend this place? As I hinted at the beginning you either love this place or hate it. There is nothing wrong with its basic ingredients, and I have to give it to the staff that they are very obliging and welcoming, but it's just like a movie set, scrape under the surface and you are not left with very much at all.
