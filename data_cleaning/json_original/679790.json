{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Small On the Outside: Even Smaller on the Inside Firstly, the Lombardo is situated directly opposite the main train station in downtown Frankfurt. It therefore boasts a great location for touring the city during the day. Unfortunately, however, the Haut Bahnhof area of the city does not have the greatest of reputations and travellers, especially singles and females, should be wary wondering around there on their own at night.It appears small from the outside and it is certainly small upon entering. The reception is petite yet tidy and there is a small bar area off to the right. Staff were polite and as helpful as possible. I was staying for only one night as part of a business trip so was not too concerned about the quality that was on offer, but in all other circumstances it would have been an unsatisfactory stay. Especially if I had been funding the stay myself! I am aware, however, that you get what you pay for and the Leonardo is nothing more than a basic, budget travellers' hotel. My (admittedly) single room was tiny. So tiny in fact that you could not rotate without bumping into furniture, whether it be the bed, wardrobe, or W.C and shower in the even smaller bathroom. The room possessed the bare amount in terms of luxuries however they did manage to squeeze in a minibar and tea/coffee making facilities. There was a reasonable selection of multi-national T.V. channels but that is where the luxuries end. This is nothing more than a dark and slightly dingy budget hotel. Ideal for cheap weekend breaks, stag parties or lads' weekends. Facilities for the business traveller are next to nothing so I would go elsewhere if you expect more.", "Date": "Jun 4, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR650879522", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Max Ray"}, {"Content": "Good facilities but poor service I stayed in the Leonardo Hotel for 3 nights this week and overall the hotel is of a very good standard with well sized double rooms and decent bathrooms (bath with shower). The lighting in the bathrooms wasn't great and may pose a slight issue for female travellers (mirror is recessed into the wall and spot lights cause shadows when you are in front of the mirror).There are two choices for breakfast (hot buffet breakfast (\u9227?4.50) and continental breakfast (\u9227?)) which were ok but probably overpriced for what you got.The location of the Hotel is very central (across the road from the Hauptbahnhof) and seems safe enough at night (the hotel is ~ 10m from the escalator into the Hauptbahnhof underground shopping center). I had no issues with security in the area.The main problems I experienced?The Leonardo Hotel has invested in it's own WiFi network and my experience was extremely poor. I rely very heavily on Internet access while travelling and outages affect me greatly. The loss of internet connectivity on the morning of the 3rd day was inconvenient and I attempted to check-out so I could move to another hotel with reliable internet. Unfortunately, the hotel wanted to charge me for the final night I had pre-booked. After waiting in the hotel lobby for about 45 minutes, they indicated that the internet was working again and I confirmed that the service was working again. They assured me this was not a common occurrence and these things can happen to everyone including me on my home DSL line (they missed the whole point that they were a business selling a service). Despite my better wisdom, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.I arrived back to the hotel at approximately 10pm with the intention of catching up on some email - the Internet service was down again and the the hotel staff on duty that evening could not fix the issue. The following morning the duty manager seemed totally unaware of the issue at all!On one of the nights I experienced some noisy pub goers (from the irish pub next door), but otherwise it was extremely quiet. If you want a quiet room, I believe the hotel does have rooms at the rear which you could request. This was a very minor annoyance and didn't bother me at all - I was awake and watching TV at the time - but some travellers may want to take it into account.The final issue I had was that the hotel overcharged me for my stay by \u9227?0 per night which I am now disputing with them (they were not keen for me to see the bill when I checked out so I could check the charges).Overall: Nice central hotel with good facilities. Hotel is value for money if you look for a deal online. Do NOT stay here if you need reliable internet or want top class service. If you're looking for a cheap get-away for the weekend it's ideal!", "Date": "Nov 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR316028950", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "HerrJager"}, {"Content": "\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u20ac\u20ac\u9289\u55d0\u5137\u9289\u71b4\u5115\u9288?#x201d;   showReview(19160643, 'full');", "Date": "Mar 31, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR382598358", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187337-d679790-r16662069-Leonardo_Hotel_Frankfurt_City-Frankfurt_Hesse.html", "HotelID": "679790", "Price": "$196"}}
