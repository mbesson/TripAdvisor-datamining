Positives: We had a large Family Room for 3 people which was very clean, comfortable, and modern. It was located on a quiet street in Sultanhamet within a 5-minute walk to all the big sights such as the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sofia. The rooms still feel new with updated plumbing, electrical (many outlets for charging), heating/cooling, and sound-proof windows. The rooms have safes, kettle with tea and coffee, mini bar (while inexpensive it is still more expensive than the little store across the street), hair dryer, and many toiletries. The wifi is free, fast, and reliable and they have a laptop you can borrow. We used their private transportation to/from the airport (50TL paid in cash) and we had absolutely no problems. The breakfast was free and we didn't have any problems. Breakfast was served until 10 and we didn't arrive until at least 9:20 every morning and there was plenty of food and items were refilled. There was a different selection of food on different mornings. One morning they were out of cold milk for the cereal and someone ran and got some and brought it to our table. On nice mornings, it was very pleasant to eat on the rooftop terrace. If you eat outside BEWARE the BIRDS! The first morning we put our full plates on an outside table and went back inside to get tea the birds ate from our plates. The staff (front desk, housekeeping, and breakfast room) at this hotel is incredible. They are nice and helpful and extremely hard working. We were there for 4 nights and the same people were always working. Twice when we were waiting in the lobby and the rooftop terrace they brought us Turkish coffee and Turkish Delight. One night they left us a bottle of wine and a basket of fruit. They also gave us a gift when we left. It was nice being so close to the main sights, as we had to try multiple times to get in the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sofia. They have postcards, maps, and guidebooks for sale in the lobby. Negatives: Noise. You can hear people in the hall and some noise from other rooms. One night we were woken at 3 am by people in the hall saying goodnight to each other and then we were woken again a few hours later by an early morning alarm in another room. No stopper for bathroom sink. The breakfast room is cramped with tables too big for the space. In spite of the negatives, if I were to return to the Sultanhamet area of Istanbul, I would stay here. Nearby restaurants: Bereket D\u00c3\u00b6ner take a left out of hotel, turn left at intersection and it's the first kebab place. The food was good and cheap and most diners were locals. The owner is really nice and friendly and not pushy. Sultanhamet Fish Market is across the street and down from Bereket D\u00c3\u00b6ner. Food is good and people are nice. We ate here for dinner twice. Rumeli/Mozaik has outdoor seating and we had a good dinner. Take a right out of hotel and jog left. There are tons of restaurants on this street and Rumeli is closer to the main street with the trams.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cHelpful staff close to sights\u201d", "Author": "traveller50london", "ReviewID": "UR128329795", "Content": "We arrived very late ( airport seems to have a capacity issue ) but Hotel had taxi waiting.

We stayed at the White House and found the staff to be very helpful and attentive. They arranged for a pick up from our flight at the airport. We arrived late evening so this was so helpful in getting us to the hotel in approximately 30 minutes. We were offered a choice of rooms one with a balcony and a second slightly larger room without the balcony. As it was early March and the temperatures were very low we felt that it was unlikley that we would make use of the balcony so chose the larger room. It was spotlessly clean and although on the small size had all the amenities that would normally be found in a four star hotel room. Breakfast was included and was self service in the restaurant on the hotel roof with views of the Blue Mosque and the Bosphorous. Apart form breakfast we did not eat in the hotel but followed the advice of the reception staff on resturants in the immediate vicinity. We were not dissapointed there is a very large choice of cusine on offer within a very short walking distance and we enjoyed every meal especially the seafood at the Sultanhamet fish restaurant which is withina 2 minute walk. The hotel is well located within very easy walking distance of the Blue Mosque, Haggia Sophia and the Grand Bazaar. The rooms on the street side can be nosiy in the morning, as the town wakes up, especially with the call to prayers. It is best to keep the windows well shut but the room is equiped with air conditioning and heating so this should not present a problem. Whilst nothing to do with the hotel be warned about the shoe shine men walking the streets. They drop a brush just in front of you and if you pick it up or try to draw their attention to this you have already fallen into their web. Beware of their con tricks! Apart from this we found the people charming but you need to keep a sense of humour towards the numerous shop keepers trying to entice you into their shops and selling their wares. Some of the comments that amused us were: \"Come into my shop I have everything except customers!\" \"It is almost free\" We hope that you will enjoy your stay in the White House it is a great base to explore the extraordinary city that is Istanbul and the staff are eager to assist in any way that they can", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat hotel!\u201d", "Author": "psuhellcat", "ReviewID": "UR125741875", "Content": "everyone was so friendly, and the hotel was in a perfect location in sultanahmet to see all the sites very easily! the room was big and the beds were comfortable, and we had no problems at all. i haven't a single complaint!", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cHighly recommended\u201d", "Author": "ERS123", "ReviewID": "UR125741525", "Content": "My friend and I stayed at the White House Hotel for 3 nights over a long weekend and were very pleased with our stay.

Lots of little boxes in the bathroom covering a wide range of toiletries. The only draw back I have of the white house is the shower.

At the hotel, I was greeted by Omar and offered a complimentary drink and piece of turkish delight. I was taken up to my room (401) and upon opening the door, found numerous birthday balloons decorating the room, a very pleasant surprise! A few minutes later, there was a knock at the door and upon opening it, I found a waiter with a birthday cake with sparklers!! I had a superior room on the top floor, fairly spacious with a decent bathroom, the shower had both power and rain heads for a great experience. If you want a room for a view, this isn't the one, as it looked out over a number of older buildings but then I wasn't going to be spending my day looking out of the window!! The room has a TV, with a good range of channels, I found at least 6 English speaking channels on checking, but it wasn't used much! The hotel is very close to the main sites of the Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia, approximately 5 minutes walking time. You can see them from the roof terrace where breakfast is served. The staff were extremely helpful in where to go for sightseeing, where to eat. cannot be faulted. I had to leave for an early flight and was surprised that they gave me a birthday present of the return trip to the airport (normally 40 Euros).

The hotel is in the heart of Sultanahmet - so if you want easy access to all of the major tourist sights, and a sense of the Old City, then this is a very good base. The Hagi Sofia and the Blue Mosque itself are 2-3 minutes stroll away and the oft-lauded Cagaloglu Hamami is around the corner. There is a tea shop three doors down and a small grocery store across the road. Even the tramvay stop is not more than 100m walk away and from there it's easy going to the Spice Market and Kirakoy. There are plenty of acceptably-good restaurants nearby although for the fashionable places where the locals eat and drink you'll have to go to the other side of the Golden Horn. The service is superlative; it is personalised and thoughtful without being intrusive or patronising. Eve and the team treat every guest with a personal touch - I sat in the lobby at one point (trying to sort flights the evening after I had checked out) and I saw her greet every guest in the door and discuss all matter of things that guests were interested in with some depth of knowledge.

The rooms are spotlessly clean and quiet, even if you face the front street. While a bit small, I found the size to be average or slightly better than average to most European rooms. The location is absolutely perfect. As close as you would ever care to be, but removed enough to be peaceful and quiet. The few minor things that keep the rating below excellent primarily relate to the beds. Not only are they hard, but the construction makes them squeak when moving around which for a light sleeper, could be a problem. We ended up staying in two rooms. The first had an air conditioner that moderately cooled the room, but our second room worked just fine. We encountered a problem with the airport shuttle broke down on our trip to the hotel. The driver could speak no English, so it was a bit distressing to be standing on the side of the road with our luggage and no idea where we were located, while he flagged down taxis to try and convince them to transport us to the hotel. The hotel staff was very sympathetic and covered the cost of the cab.

We went to Istanbul for our son\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s wedding and had a continuing series of wedding-related evening functions and activities for most of our stay. The White House is a boutique hotel and lacks many of the amenities offered by larger and usually more expensive hotels and chains, but we prefer the charm and less crowded character of hotels like the White House. I cannot say enough positive about the White House. I booked our stay at the White House after reviewing dozens of available hotels on TripAdvisor. The choice in Istanbul is essentially among Sultanahmet (the old town), Taxim (the newer district on the eastern side of the Golden Horn), and the Asian side of the Bosphorus. We wanted to be able to see some of the historic mosques and other sights without having to walk or take taxis for long distances, so we chose Sultanahmet. It was a great choice. Topkapi Palace, the Archaeological Museums, Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Basilica Cistern, and the Grand Bazaar are all 10-15 minute easy walks from the hotel. We typically did one of the historic sights in the morning and went out to a wedding activity in the afternoon and evening. The White House arranged for our taxis, which did not require advanced booking and always arrived within 5 minutes, and, in most cases, secured drivers who did not stray too far from the most direct route. We were especially grateful to Cafer and Elif, who were on duty at the White House in the evening and daytime, respectively. They were unflaggingly friendly and aimed to help us with issues whenever possible. When my daughter and granddaughter needed some hair work before the wedding, Elif secured an immediate appointment with a hairdresser just down the street. Both were very happy with the result. Because both of our families arrived together and shared a complimentary ride to the hotel, Cafer, without being asked, comped our ride back to the airport at 4:00 am because we had used only one free ride and the hotel provides one free ride for each room. My daughter was a bit under the weather for a day or so after arriving and on the second day, the maid appeared at the door with a tray of breakfast items so that she would not have to go up to the roof-top breakfast area. Everyone at the hotel was great. The hotel is quiet and on a side street with little traffic. The two rooms that we rented were the family rooms, which had two double beds, desk, and table and chairs: plenty of space for us with a modern bathroom and a shower. The rooms were clean and very well appointed: very comfortable. They do not have a restaurant: breakfast is served in a roof-top room with an open air patio. It was fine. There are literally hundreds of restaurants and shops within a few blocks and there is easy access within 5 minutes to a tram that runs over to the eastern side of the Golden Horn. This turned out to be an ideal place for us. We are not big \u00e2\u20ac\u0153night-life\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd folks and did not look for any clubs or more trendy places for evening activities, which I am told are more abundant in Taxim. The only drawback to the White House is that the warren of small streets in the Sultanahmet area made it difficult for some taxi drivers to find the hotel. Taking a street map printed out from the internet helped a lot. After a couple of days, we had identified the best route into the area and helped the drivers ourselves. All in all, we had a great time in Istanbul, enjoyed the wedding and all of its activities, and visited many of the historic sights. Much of our enjoyment came from our being able to get places and get things done without a lot of hassle, much due to the White House Hotel, its excellent location, and superb staff.

Our room was a little small but nonetheless was very tidy, modern and comfortable. It was appointed with mini bar, in-room coffee/tea, cable TV, free wi-fi, and arguably the best room air conditioner I have experienced in any hotel (very quiet but effective). There was no price gouging on top-up services such as laundry, mini-bar prices, and airport transfers, which simply added to a pleasurable stay. Across the road is a neat little convenience store where simple provisions such as water, snacks, bread, ice cream and so forth can be bought in preparation for the next tour or outing.

Being warned that this is a boutique hotel, we didn't expect a 4star or 5star status hotel, but a cozy place with good service. And our expectations were fulfilled. The White House is indeed a very cozy hotel with very friendly personnel who is willing to answer any questions and give (at most times) good quidance. It's location is excellent, next to most historic monuments as well as a convenient tram station. However to be on the fair site I would like to state the following minor drawbacks: - The location is situated in a quite neighborhood, but it is still close to a couple of buzzing tourist streets. In fact 2 out of our 5 nights there we were awaken by drunken / fighting tourists. Maybe a good idea is to choose a room not overlooking the street. - The rooms are in fact a bit small especially if shared by two. - The breakfast could have been a bit more inspiring. - Finally although this is not a drawback of this specific hotel I would strongly advice future guests to avoid taking the organized tours offered by the tour operators who co-operate with the hotels. Although we asked for the cheapest possible way of taking the Bosporus cruise, one of the staff still recommended the tour operators who co-operate with their hotel. As a result we ended up paying 70 euro (35 euro each) for a 1 hour boat trip at the Bosporus, and spent the rest hour picking up (and then returnig) the other guest from the surrounding hotels. Exactly the same trip would have cost us 10 Lira each (i.e. about 4.3 euro) if the ticket was bought from the harbor. Tram fare from our hotel to the harbor was less than 1 euro per person for each way..... No need to mention that the next day for our princess islands cruise we bought the tickets from the harbor.... :)", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Karachi, Pakistan", "Title": "\u201cBEYOUND EXPECTATIONS !\u201d", "Author": "AZW070", "ReviewID": "UR115328648", "Content": "We booked 2 double rooms for 4 nights .

The hotel is an easy 5 minute walk to Hagia Sophia, Sultanahmet Park, and the Blue Mosque, a 10 minute walk to the Grand Bazaar, and a 20 minute walk to the Galata Bridge \u00e2\u20ac\u201c all very interesting, stimulating walks. The hotel is on an active (and interesting) street, but it quiets down at night, and the windows seal out any outside noise. There seems to be no early commotion outside as you find at so many European hotels. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not sure how you could ask for a better location. The hotel staff is young and cheerful, knows Istanbul extremely well, and everyone understands and delivers true hospitality unlike anywhere I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed. These folks clearly want you to have a memorable experience in Istanbul and at their hotel, and will do whatever you ask them to in order to meet those ends and bring you back to stay again. Their advice about logistics, restaurants, and places to visit are spot on. Harun answered emails before the trip promptly and specifically, and he graciously arranged free transport from the airport with a driver waiting outside passport control with my name on a sign \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a nice thing to have waiting on arrival. (They will also instruct about options to return to the airport when departing, including arranging a reasonably priced private car.) You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re greeted upon arrival with a cold fruit drink and Turkish Delight, and encouraged to relax and rest as long as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like after your long trip. Elif at the front desk is certainly the most charming, endearing person you can hope for. She greeted us cheerfully upon arrival, and, among other things, she calmly gave us excellent advice on getting about the city, showed us on a map how to get to everywhere we wanted to visit, and offered to guide us home by phone if ever we got lost in or around Istanbul (which, thanks to her, we did not). Elif is really a treasure you will not forget. Omer also is unfailingly kind and helpful, and he patiently and pleasantly answered all our questions and asked about our day each time we met. Mohammed, the quiet assistant, is there to assist with luggage, and any other logistic challenge you might have. In just a few days, you feel as if you are leaving a wonderful family when you leave. The rooms and bathrooms are utterly spotless and tastefully decorated in local style, and a single is comfortable and compares well with regard to size with European hotels. The shower is small \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so it goes \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fine for a few days. Free coffee and tea service is included in the room, and if you must indulge in a drink from the minibar, the prices are unoffensive. Better to grab from the mini-supermarket on the nearby corner, though, where you can also snag late night munchies. Breakfast on the roof, with the views of the Hagia Sophia, the Bosphorus bridge, and Istanbul, is a great way to start a day. We were up there just after 7 a.m. and surprisingly had the rooftop to ourselves each day. Turkish style breakfast could be a wee bit better, though we managed to load up enough calories for the mornings ahead. It does include scrambled and hard boiled eggs, breads and cakes, many cereals and puddings, cheeses, fruits, coffee, tea, and juices. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t eat this hearty a breakfast at home most days. Istanbul is a nonstop sensory and cultural bombarsion that everyone should experience. Recommendations include the public ferry Bosphorus cruise; grilled fish on the quay near the Galata Bridge; shopping in and around the streets of the Spice Market (remember to ship or check in your purchases of anything fluid); shopping and haggling for carpets, pashmina, and olive oil; 24x7 people watching; learning about the Islamic faith; of course the Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque; learning about the rich, colorful history of Turkey; and savoring the White House Hotel experience. I definitely plan to come to Istanbul again, and there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no need to shop around for a hotel.

Furthermore the breakfast has great room for improvement with regards to diversity and quality which is of poor standard. I travel to Istanbul quite often and usually I stay in a 5 star hotel that charges me about the same that this hotel and has all the anemities and comfort and generally I was very pleased. When, however, I checked the great reviews and ratings that this hotel gets in tripadvisor and booking.com, it seemed like a good idea to try it. I was greatly disapoInted. I cannot say it is a bad hotel, but it definitely it is nothing more than average. For the same price you can get much better accomodation in Istanbul. To see that is one of the 3 most highly recommended hotels in Istanbul is definitely very misleading. I do not understand why it gets such high ratings and great reviews. Maybe it is because the kind e-mailed request of the hotel manager to give them \"the best guests score (Excellent score or the best top score(10) point)\" does affect people and gets results.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGood place for leisure among historic sights of Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Serezha", "ReviewID": "UR95913687", "Content": "Very good hotel for walking through hystoric center of Istanbul.

Upon our arrival at the hotel, we were greeted with a welcome cocktail and chatted for a few minutes with the hotel's friendly staff about our stay.

The hotel is a short walk to the Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sofia, many shops and restaurants and the metro (which you can take to the Spice Bazaar, New Mosque, Taksim Square, etc). The location could not have been better. Also, our room included a daily complimentary breakfast. The breakfast was a great way to start the day and included eggs, coffee, fresh fruits, cereal, olives, sausage and various breakfast breads. I believe it is served from 7-10 a.m. everyday. Because we were celebrating our anniversary, the hotel brought us a small cake and two cocktails on New Year's Eve to celebrate. This was a really nice gesture and is just one example of the hotel's great hospitality. The staff greeted us every morning and night like royalty and were always available to answer our questions and help us with planning our days in the city.

During a 5-day stay, we never got in a cab or took public transportation. We just went wherever we wanted to go. Tons of good restaurants within walking distance, as well as most of Istanbul's major historical attractions (Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Spice Market, etc.). We had one minor issue with the White House, which was a shower that simply would not drain properly. We mentioned it to the front desk, and efforts were made to fix it, but it was not corrected by the time we left.", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London UK", "Title": "\u201cCharming quiet gem close to main historic attractions\u201d", "Author": "FAFJDI", "ReviewID": "UR88809956", "Content": "The hotel is situated off the beaten track, away from the noise of bars and tourists yet just 5-10 minutes walk from Aya Sophia/Blue Mosque/Topkapi etc and the tram service.

If you have a lot of luggage you may struggle with frustration of moving something to get to something else.

Sure enough the transfer was waiting at the arrivals exit displaying our name.Great when arriving in a strange city at this time of night. Hotel ideally located in a nondescript, quiet street in the centre of all the attractions in the Sultanahmet area all within a few minutes easy walk. Easy access to the airport by getting a tram from Sultanahmet (less than 5 mins walk) to the end of the line then the adjacent metro to the airport. Allow one hour. Room beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. Had a room at the back - no view but superbly quiet. Good selection at breakfast; not your fry ups of the big Turkish resorts but healthy and nourishing. Finally the staff. I won't pick any individual out, that would be unfair, as they were all superb. Always willing to help and ready to chat with a Turkish tea not far away. They would be a credit to any organisation. A nice touch on checking out, a box of Turkish delight for my partner.So if you want a boutique hotel with superb service in the centre of it all this may be for you.

When we decided we wanted to visit Istanbul during the American Thanksgiving Holiday I had contacted a few of my usual vendors. None of their hotels jumped out at me. The options offered were either in the Taksim Square area which is lively yet a distance from the main historic sites or peripheral to the Sultanahmet neighborhood which is walking distance to the most important sites. We came across The White House via reviews and postings from many European reviews. Arrival: Communication with the hotel was excellent from day 1. We booked the hotel about 2 months prior to arrival. Since we were staying 3+ nights the hotel offered a one-way transfer from/to the airport. We chose to accept their offer upon arrival. After a 9+ hour flight (excellent tail-winds from New York), we arrived in Istanbul early (9AM), after clearing visa/immigration and with no checked luggage, we proceeded to the main entry hall and a driver had our name on a sign. We proceeded to the car and within 25 minutes (even with Istanbul traffic) we arrived at the hotel. When you first arrive, you may be slightly taken aback. You are driving on narrow streets, a true historic quarter with a mix of low-rise buildings that have seen better days. When you pull up to the hotel, it cannot be missed, a gleaming white building, literally a beacon on a nondescript street. In all fairness, Noah\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Ark next door is also well presented. Upon check-in we met Harun who I had been corresponding with. The lobby is small with a seating area. Unlike the typical check-in, Harun had us sit-down and relax. While he pulled up the reservation a fellow employee brought us orange juice and pear flavored Turkish Delight (which I am now addicted to). We were also presented with a gift, a small \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Evil Eye\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd bead, which is to ward off bad spirits. It is a great souvenir of the hotel. Harun also provided a few brochures including restaurant suggestions and options for a Turkish Bath. Room: Once checked in an employee showed us to our room on the 4th floor (the top floor as the roof is open-air). Since it was just two of us we opted for a small double. By American standards the room was small, however by Japanese standards, it is probably a suite. While small it was well laid-out including an expansive bathroom with shower stall, sleeping area, built-in desk, armoire, mini-bar, tea pot (with assorted teas and coffee) and what made the room physically smaller yet was most welcoming a set-back terrace. Yes, a terrace open to the sky. Note, we did see the room across the hall, massive! Seems to be about 4 rooms per floor. Bedding: The bed was truly one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in and I have a Sleep Number bed. It was so comfortable and unfortunately I spend 24+ hours in it due to a later acquired stomach ailment. Location: As mentioned the location is prime. The street is active during the day yet at night it is very quiet (and the doors/windows are soundproof). In the immediate area are many restaurants so you will not starve. About \u00c2\u00bd block away is a small convenience store with soft-drinks and snacks which came in handy when touring. The main strip of the area is about 2 blocks away where there are many restaurants including global chains such as McDonalds and Starbucks and local mainstays including The Pudding Shop and many confectionary stores. This is also where there the tram stops. Within 5 minutes you can walk to the Grand Bazaar. Within 10 minutes an easy walk to The Blue Mosque, the Haghia Sophia and the Topkapi Palace. Be prepared for the hills i.e. bring comfortable shoes. We were literally able to visit most of the sites on our first day. Of note, if heading to Taksim Square, best to take the tram. Breakfast: The White House offers a nice breakfast service, a self-serve in the lower-level which is an expansive dining area. There are juices, coffee/tea, eggs, meats, vegetables, cereals, bread, jam and so forth. The hearty breakfasts allowed us to skip lunch. Dinner: As mentioned there are many restaurants in the area all looking for business. Take note; use the suggestions of the hotel. The restaurants they suggest are excellent both for food and value, you will not be disappointed. Service: This is where the hotel truly shines. As mentioned on the 2nd evening of our trip I got ill with a stomach issue. It was not food poisoning; it was due to the heavy dairy products I had ingested throughout the day. If you are lactose intolerant, be forewarned, Turkish dairy products are addictive yet very, very rich and thus I paid the price. Their ice cream makes gelato taste generic. All the hotel staff was truly caring. The following morning after a somewhat unpleasant night the staff advised where a pharmacy was (I was bedridden) so my wife went and bought the medication. When the maid came in to clean the room, I was laying in bed. She did not speak English and me, no Turkish. However when I pointed to my stomach she filled the tea pot with water and selected a combination of teas from the basket and made me tea. It was a real treat and I did feel much better. Of note, the following morning when I was finally able to make it to breakfast as I poured myself orange juice, the maid came over, said \u00e2\u20ac\u0153no\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and made me tea instead knowing the acidity of the OJ would probably not be the best option. This is true service! The rest of the hotel staff was truly concerned as well. They would ask my wife if I was OK and when I was able to venture out, they asked how I was doing. This is one of the luxuries of a smaller boutique hotel. Client Mix: The hotel attracts a varied client mix. We met families from the Middle East, a couple from Norway and a few Americans. The hotel offers rooms for many different configurations of guests. Concerning physically challenged accessibility, while there is an elevator, it is small. There are rooms on the first level, however access from the street to the hotel is via three steps and the street itself is cobblestone. When we did check-out, again a smooth transition and the hotel arranged for a car service (a bargain at 35 LTR (approx $26 USD) versus a taxi at 50 LTR). You can also take the tram to the subway however I was still not 100%. The hotel provided us with Turkish Delight as a parting gift as well. If visiting Istanbul and you desire a well-run, clean, perfectly located hotel in the historic neighborhood, The White House cannot be beat. There are many similar hotels in the area and if I had more time I would have \u00e2\u20ac\u0153popped-in\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and checked them out. I would assume most are excellent, however from past reviews and now personal experience I believe The White House is a notch above the rest. If you are looking for more modern, larger hotel options, may be best to look in the Taksim Square area which is a hub for transit and shopping. However for the short-time we were in Istanbul the location of The White House was prime and a hotel we will recommend to friends and clients.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "VOLOS-GREECE", "Title": "\u201cexellent hotel in sultan ahmed\u201d", "Author": "CHRISTOS_GR60", "ReviewID": "UR88665672", "Content": "i stayed middle of november 2010 in white house hotel in centrum from istanbul wonderfull position just a2minutes away by feet from aya sofia and blue mosqe. very impressive new hotel, very beautiful designed,not very big ,really home atmosphere.very comfortable rooms and extremely clean. and now the staff. very welcoming people from the first to the last minute.

While I have no way of knowing if it is, in fact, the best, it is certainly an excellent choice and deserving of patronage. We went to Turkey for a 16 day tour of the western half of the country and set aside two days before and four days after the tour. The hotel offers to pick up guests from the airport at no charge if one is staying a minimum number of days. While we weren't staying the minimum on our first visit, the hotel nevertheless agreed to pick us up for no charge. Upon check-in the staff was very friendly and helpful; had us sit and served orange juice and Turkish Delight while checking in. The room was obviously new but very small; mattress exceptionally firm; nice foam pillows; TV very small (19\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd LCD) and we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know how to work it; a/c/ worked very well; full amenities in bath; no face cloths; shower only and water in shower started lukewarm and got cooler. Hotel very close to Blue Mosque (150 yards), Aya Sophia, Basilica Cistern, Hippodrome and maybe a 10 minute walk to the Grand Bazaar. If you see my review of the Senatus you'll see that we only spent one night at the WH prior to the tour instead of two. Even though we were staying at another hotel we went back to the WH and asked them to fax our passports to the Florence Nightengale Museum, which they gladly did. Another of many examples of friendly and helpful service. Our last four nights in Turkey we were in room 402 this time; very large in comparison to what we had last time; queen bed; small shower but water temp fine; no face clothes or Kleenex; bed comfortable; four pillows; hair dryer; tea pot; mini bar; small TV that we learned how to operate \u00e2\u20ac\u201c several hundred channels. The breakfast room is in the basement and is nothing special. I'm not sure if the decorator was going for an Ottoman feel to the hotel.

The hotel also has a couple of netbooks that one can take to one's room and check e-mail or surf the net using the free WiFi. When we checked out at 4 a.m., the hotel gave us a small box of Turkish Delight. The hotel is very new and clean. I left a tip for the maid every day and one afternoon we came back to the room and she'd sprinkled our bed with rose petals.

We turned up at 7am and they had a driver at the airport to pick us up. Awesome! Saved the headache of dealing with the rip off taxi drivers that plague Istanbul. I booked the night before because I wanted to ensure we had a room when we got to the hotel rather than wait till 2pm to check in. Got to the hotel and the lady at check in advised that we would not have to pay for the night before as they had a spare room. What?? Has anyone heard of this kind of service? We stayed at the Ritz Carlton for the last part of our stay and even there they charged us $100 euros for an extra 4 hours late check out. The hotel is centrally located and you can walk anywhere including the mosques and Grand Bazaar. Cafar at the front desk is a great guy and will look after you. They will go to great lengths to ensure your stay is happy. When I complained to them about the Hammam they recommended to me around the corner from the hotel, Cafar told me he would go there and give them a piece of his mind and was very upset that I had not been treated well. Cafar also recommended a fantastic restaurant for dinner (Amedros) - it was the best meal we had in Istanbul for the whole 9 days we were there. The other thing I should mention is the laundry rates. They took our laundry to a laudromat around the corner and just charged us what was charged to them - about AU$10 a bag. They even did the laundry of our friends who weren't staying at the hotel! This above and beyond service is what epitomises this hotel and is consistent with previous reviews.

I have always counted on TripAdvisor to help plan out our annual European vacations, and I have to say, this time you let me down. For every of the five days we stayed there, my wife and I looked at each other with wonderment on how this could be rated number one. In fairness, let me talk about the positives.... The Service - Elif and Harun, along with the entire team, were absolutely the most amazing staff one could imagine, true care and concern, fabulous english, there for you before you think you need them. The Location, If you want to be near all of the most amazing restaurants and sites in the old city, you could not find a better location. And now for our concerns, The Room - We stayed in room 305, was very small, with almost no room for luggage or to neatly keep your stuff organised. If you wanted to relax, be prepared to lie in bed only. In Istanbul for the first time, I am prepared to forgive on size, but I can't forgive the noise during the day. Around 7 or 8 each morning, and going steady till around after supper, a very loud industrial washer would run continuously, making so much noise it was horrible. We tried several times to have an afternoon nap before going out for the evening, and found it impossible. We heard the noise all throughout the hotel, or would have asked for another room. The Location - The street that the hotel is on, while near the center of most attractions, is very, very rundown. Homeless person living on the steps across from the Hotel, clearing his nose and lungs every few minutes, was just gross.

Both were family rooms that had two beds, a single and a double. The hotel is located a few blocks from a street with a tramline and the Haga Sophia and Blue Mosque, Topkapi, the Grand Bazaar, Hippodrome and other historic sites. It is the perfect location for someone who wants to be in walking distance of what was the historic center of Istanbul and Constantinople. If you like to walk, you are about 20 mins walk from the Golden Horn and the port for Bosporus cruises or ferries to the Asia side. The hotel offers free pick up from the airport, but will charge you 45 euros for a small van to return you to the airport. With 4 adults and several large bags, an Istanbul taxi could not have taken us all to the airport. The hotel is relatively recently renovated. The rooms and interior spaces were immaculate. The bedrooms were large by European standards, and typical for an American hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful with recommendations for restaurants and local travel directions. We had especially good service from Cafer, Elif (also a tour guide at Topkapi on her day off) and Omar. With the tram nearby, it was easy to use the tram and a funicular to travel to Taksim square, Istanbul's equivalent to Times Square in NYC. The area around the hotel is called Sultanamet. According to one of my sons, a travel guide says it is a working class, conservative area. Although there are many tourists and tour buses in the area, the hotel is on a quiet side street with a few businesses that don't generate a lot of traffic. We did not hear any street noise in our rooms. The bathroom is typical for a European hotel. The shower is a plastic capsule with handheld and waterfall show heads. Breakfast has eggs and something like Vienna sausages, along with a choice of cheese, yogurt, cereal, fresh fruit, tomatoes, cucumbers,bread and cake, very good coffee and tea. There really isn't any nightlife in this area, although we did find a place of a 3 man band playing in an open air lounge with water pipes with flavored tobacco. Some restaurants do not serve alcohol, although most do. The service was just about the best we have ever experienced. One of my sons called to ask where he could buy some beer and the hotel sent someone to buy it for him and bring it to his room, even though they had some in the minibar. They will soon open a rooftop area to serve breakfast. In their literature, they say they are not a 4 or 5 star hotel, but a boutique hotel. I would agree completely with that description.

My husband and I booked a stay at The White House Hotel for my 40th Birthday in April 2010. It was intended as a quick stop off on the way to Northern Cyprus but it was much, much more than that. Harun (thank you !!!) was fantastic even before we arrived dealing with all the things that my husband had asked for to make the stay \"special\". The emails came back incredibly quickly, saying the room reserved was \"special\" (and it was!), the taxi had been booked, etc, etc, There's nothing that I can add that hasn't already been said in the other reviews - so fantastic hotel, great location, close to all attractions, safe surroundings, (don't let the first view of the street at night put you off) it really is safe, metro at the bottom of the street and don't miss a visit to the nearby underground cysterns. We walked around the area until very late at the weekend nights and had absolutely no problems at all. It's the cleanest, best kept hotel I've ever stayed in, it was newly opened and it really shoed - everything really was top quality. The staff were as everyone says friendly, well infomed, helpful able to make some lovely recommendations - what they didn't know about Istanbul really isn't worth knowing. Being a bit of an independent explorer I was a bit worried before we went that the recommendations by the staff might feel a bit \"pushy\" (that's the reserved British in us) but this absolutely was not the case. They recommended places to eat/see but were also more than happy to direct us to other places that I'd earmarked - telling us the best local food to try rather than trying to change our minds. The nice touches from the hotel/staff just went on and on (even a thank you email when we arrived home). The taxi was waiting for us at the airport, the driver told us all about the city/sights, the hotel had a birthday cake waiting for me in reception, the good luck eye on arriving and the Turkish Delight on leaving - it just went on and on and on. The whole staff and management of the hotel really should be congratulated on the customer service. We tried throughout the 4 days to work out who the actual \"manager\" or owner was but it was just impossible as all the staff really took a personal pride in the hotel (quite rightly so). I felt like I was in one of those training videos - the ones that show the bad customer service as \"before\" and the outstanding customer service as the \"after\". Take my word for it this really was the after one - even with the high standard that they've set I'm sure any stay here will exceed all your expectations. I'm so pleased to see that they are planning a roof top terrace as this was the only thing that I would have like to have when staying there (another sign that they can anticipate their customers needs?).

In any case, if you're not into exploring a city on foot, the very modern and easy-to-use tram was just down the street from the hotel.

Breakfast was reasonable, albeit after 5 days you do get a bit bored - some more loacl food like houmous would be good ! The actual room was very nice, with just enough room for our packs, a good bed, and plenty of light. The bathroom was excellent with a powerful shower. Our only issue is that the windows did not really block all the noise out, and the curtains let all the light in. As others have said, it is a noisy city, and that is not the hotels fault, but better glazing / fitting windows and heavier curtains would help. I am not a great sleeper it has to be said but I had to use ear plugs with a disturbed / homeless person sleeping across the street who would then shout out in the morning.

Well deserves it's top spot. Arrival: We walked from the train station which is definitely do-able as long as you know where you're going. We nearly made it, then asked directions when nearby and got a bit lost. I rang the hotel and they sent someone out to meet us and carry our bags to the hotel. Very good service. Check-in friendly with excellent English and a cold drink/Turkish delight was very welcome :-) Room: we stayed in room 202 (see pics). Great decor. Sumptuous but not OTT. Definitely has the 'wow' factor when you open the door to your room. All gold and cream. Two 'throne' chairs fab. Bathroom nice, clean, good shower, basket of shampoos, hair- dryer attached to wall etc. Room has a minibar, kettle with selection of teas and a TV (little in English language, but you won't want to be in your room much with the surroundings!). Location: Excellent. A quiet street as close as you'd want to be to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, the archaeological museum, Basillica Cistern, Topkapi Palace (see the treasure rooms and the harem) and mausoleums (all really worth a visit; see pics). The hotel recommended a restaurant 2 mins walk away (Adonin) which was great. Try the Turkish lamb/chicken dish cooked in a narrow-necked terracotta pot that they break open in front of you to serve the dish. The Bazaar is a short walk away and there are tram stops near the hotel. Lots of eateries nearby. Service: Outstanding. Young, friendly, professional staff, really happy to help. One of them found us a 10 euro per head option to get to the airport on the other side of the Bosphorus (about a 45 m in drive on quietish Sunday roads) rather than the 40 euro a head option we'd expected. We were greeted with smiles and pleasantries every time we saw any of the staff and given helpful advice and information. The staff spoke very good English. Breakfast: Very nice. Everything we wanted was there in terms of cereal, bread, fresh fruit (greengages, nectarines, melon, cherries etc), salad, olives, cold meat and cheese. Not a massive selection of hot food but we didn't really fancy that anyway as it was hot weather. Breakfast room is lovely (see pic). Ambiance: Our room was quiet except for a little bit of noise from building works next door (it really didn't bother me and I actually tend to get irritated by that kind of noise) and a bit of noise when it rained (in June we had quite alot of rain which apparently is unheard of). There was a down-pipe on the adjacent building where rainwater splashed down onto a roof. I shouldn't think it'd be a problem for most people as rain isn't frequent, and to be honest it wasn't bad. I slept through it easily. The calls to prayer were no bother in terms of volume. I never heard the 5.30am one even though I sleep reasonably lightly. The view from the window was another building, but the muslin curtains screened this tastefully. I thought the room was fabulous and I didn't miss a balcony which I might normally hanker for. Comfort: Beds very comfortable. Housekeeping kept everything spotless. Overall: I struggle to find anything bad to say about this charming, small hotel. There are few enough rooms for it to lack the impersonal feeling of bigger hotels and the vibe was friendly and upbeat. Value for money is good and I really hope that White House keeps its standards high as it was a real find.

We were given a welcome juice and turkish delight. While we sat in the lobby to figure out our plans, we were told our room would be ready in one half hour which it was (someone had checked out). We were invited to have breakfast. We found the staff very friendly, responsive, helpful at all times and were given a token gift of turkish delight upon our departure, which was a nice touch. . When I had a slight problem with the TV, the staff came up to the room, rather than try to explain it over the phone. There are about five steps to negotiate when entering or leaving the hotel. The elevator for the rest of the hotel was excellent, however. The hotel is very clean and modern. Yes, there is some construction, but really the noise is only during the daytime when one is out sightseeing. When we were exhausted from the heat, we found we were so tired and glad to be in our room for a cool rest, we did not find it offensive. We cannot say enough about the location, which we found to be excellent. Our cab driver did not know where it was exactly but they ask each other and it was no problem getting there. There is a small friendly neighborhood grocery on the corner with very reasonable prices. He invited us to sit and have apple tea at his place complimentary, which we did not. Walking just one half block in either direction, one finds numerous restaurants including our favorite Kharasoni which we also recommend. The best features of the hotel are its working air conditioning, which we have heard can be a problem in Istanbul, its cleanliness, its very nice breakfast with good service, friendliness of the staff and, definitely, the LOCATION. Only a block and a half from the Cisterns and about two blocks to the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia. We never actually had to take the tram. We could walk to the hop on, hop off bus, also only a couple of blocks away, which we took to get a terrific overview of the city. Also we found a convenient shortcut way to walk from the Grand Bazaar by asking parked tour bus drivers who knew exactly how to direct us. We were very pleased with our stay and would definitely stay there again. We recommended it to a tourist couple walking by who asked us as their air conditioning in their hotel was not working and it was very hot and humid. We also enjoyed meeting Berkun the owner of the restaurant Anatolia around the corner where we also ate. We also very much appreciated the complimentary ride in a large van to the airport. Other hotels I had contacted offered only rides FROM the hotel. Since we arrived on the cruise ship we needed a ride TO the airport.

Set on a quiet street just back from the main Divan Yulo you have main attractions like Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Grand Bazaar, Hippodrome, and Basilica Cistern all about a 5 minute walk away. Plus access to the cafe's and teras' of the neighborhood. Walk down the street and the follow the tram tracks and withing 10 minutes your at the Spice Bazaar, New Mosque and Galata bridge where you can grab a ferry, tour boat, or cross over the bridge to take the Tunel one stop subway to Istiklal a popular pedestrians only street full of shops and cafes. Make sure you do supper at 360 on Istiklal, amazing view and food. One other note. We went to the F1 race at Istanbul Park on the weekend of our trip and leading up to the race we were reading all sorts of nightmare stories about traffic getting to and from the park. We decided to skip using the city supplied buses and book a shuttle with Powertours. After about 20 minutes of pickups in the morning once on our way both Saturday and Sunday we were never in traffic and got straight to the track within 45 minutes. Saturday leaving the track was a bit of a nightmare but it boils down to a regularly busy night for traffic trying to cross the bridge from Asia to Europe (five highways feeding into one) and the added F1 traffic. It took 2.5 hours. Sunday night however - hardly any traffic issues at all. The trip took just over 1 hour.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki, Finland", "Title": "\u201cPleasant stay at Istanbul\u201d", "Author": "Huuhkaja", "ReviewID": "UR66124587", "Content": "We booked two rooms - one single and one double - and stayed here for three nights.

Our rooms were shown, how to use AC and digital safe (no extra fee for safe). Our old lady liked her single room, it is enough roomy for one person. Our room for two of us was spacious, we didn\u00c2\u00b4t hear any noices during evenings or nights and we did have very good sleep there. Minibar offered reasonable priced beverages and you can make coffee and tea in your room. Shower did have a good water pressure. Breakfast was turkish styled with few but tasty options. This hotel is located in Old Town, so it is very easy to walk to major historical sights, bars, cafes and some good restaurants. This was very helpful for us as we had this short stay with them. They organize for you free and private airport pickup and also private drive to airport with a fee which is as same as using taxi but more comfortable. Also hotel staff booked us a Bosporus cruise and we made it, though we were late after breakfast and guide just picked up us with private bus.

The manager sat down for a welcome chat and offered us a 2nd double room for our return date on the weekend. he found out the trip was for my fiancees birthday and arranged a suprise birthday cake at breakfast the next morning! The rooms were small but well decorated. Every day we returned to the hotel (4 of us, plus 2 other friends that were staying in a nearby hotel) they greated us with a tea and chat. Even our friends were treated as guests at the White House. They booked a meal out for us, plus a hamman visit and return taxi to the airport.

I had just spent 3 nights at the Ritz Carlton Istanbul on business, and decided to stay on 1 night to see Istanbul. Chose this hotel (from tripadvisor) on the basis of its location ( the Ritz is well away from the main sights) and the price ( well I was paying myself for this night!). it would have been easy to be disppointed , but this hotel met my requirements. Firstly the location is absolutely excellent ...the closeness to main sights is not exaggerated, and it is also easy to get from the hotel to them without getting lost! Secondly the staff were so warm and inviting and helpful. They gave us directions, srecommended a restaurant around the corner for the evening which was excellent and sorted out a car to the airport. I had some trouble with the heating in my room, but they came immediately to sort it out, and nothing was too much trouble.

We had initially booked at another hotel, up the street, but since it was undergoing major renovation, we worked out a deal to move to the White House. What a good move that was! The location is excellent, within walking distance of most of the famous sites and within one block of public transport. There are excellent restaurants within half a block but the street upon which it's located is quiet. It just opened last month and is small with a friendly staff, excellent management and beautiful rooms and lobby. The breakfast room is nice and the food good. Each night, upon returning to the hotel, we felt as though we were returning home. We had tea with the staff several times and enjoyed their company, but if we had not wanted to socialize, they would have understood. Elif is a lovely young woman and Harun, Cadir and others are very pleasant and helpful. The bathrooms are well-equipped and the rooms are decorated with nice details. The beds are very comfortable and we slept soundly each night. The staff speaks good English and perhaps other languages as well.
