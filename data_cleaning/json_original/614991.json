This is a great location. Directly across from the Tetuan metro stop. And only a few short blocks from either Passeig de Gracia or the Arc de Triomphe. The apartment is very large. Three bedrooms, 2 baths, living room, kitchen and pullout sofa in the living room. The last review discussed some of the cons with the apartment. Mostly the level of noise. You can hear everything from one room to the next. In addition, the apartment backs up to a courtyard with a school for young children. Recess time is very loud. We were rarely there during this time and we wore earplugs to bed at night, so problems were solved. Just want to make sure that light sleepers know this before booking. We had a wonderful stay. Location and price were terrific. We had only four in our group, but could have easily had 10 in this apartment. Enjoy your stay in Barcelona!", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Munich, Germany", "Title": "\u201cNice Apartments in a convenient, safe location\u201d", "Author": "MikeJameson", "ReviewID": "UR94494770", "Content": "We (6 people) stayed for 8 days in the 3-bedroom, 2-bath apartment. There was a small single room, 2 rooms with double beds (on with en-suite bath), and a fold-out couch for sleeping. Also included were washing machine (with powder); full kitchen with fridge, microwave, oven and stove; ironing board and iron, and a small safe. Utensils in the kitchen were sparse but adequate (could have used a corkscrew and a serving bowl of some kind). Dining table with room for 6, 2 easy chairs, television (only CNN and MSNBC in English), CD/radio were also included. Patio had a small table with 2 chairs. Everything was relatively clean, although the en-suite could use a coat of paint. All tile floors, no rugs or carpet. Neighborhood is nice, good pastry shop across the road, small markets for the necessary things. Walking distance to just about everything, we only used the metro to go to and from the airport! One complaint is the lack of sleep due to the thin walls, where you constantly hear scraping furniture and toilets flushing. We had a group of 16 (!) young people staying directly above us (this was New Year's time) and the noise was incredible. With no management onsite, there is no one to take care of such situations. The cigarette butts and ashes were raining down on our patio the entire time, as well as spilled beer and who knows what else, rendering our patio useless. I question the wisdom of renting an apartment to such a large group, and then placing them directly above a family group. I like to party as much as anyone but the noise they made was beyond belief, with no let-up for 2 days. Maybe you'll be luckier with the neighbors.... So, 6 out of 8 days were great. On arrival I recommend taking the Aerobus (A1 if you land at Terminal 1 - follow the signs to the buses downstairs), and buy a return ticket (it's cheaper, and is good for 9 days). Get off the bus at Universitat and catch the Metro (L2) for 2 stops to Tetuan. The Metro exit is directly outside the door to the apartment. One caveat: on returning to the airport, you must go to Placa de Catalunya as the bus does not stop at Universitat on the return trip! Barcelona is great, and this apartment is a good base camp.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ireland", "Title": "\u201cwould stay here again!\u201d", "Author": "kurakura9", "ReviewID": "UR79097247", "Content": "Apartment is excellent for families.

The Metro is on your doorstep and there are plenty of cafes near for breakfast. Only managed to find one supermarket around the corner for basics. As a previous mentioned by Tripadvisor member it is best to get the aerobus and get off at Universaat and get Metro to Tetuan. If you get a travel pass(recommened) then get the train from Passeig de Gracia to airport on return. If your only here for a short time then I highly recommend the Futristic Bus Tour for 1 day to get a feel for the place then choose the places you want to go back to. (\u20ac21 one day). The best place to get bus is Placa de Catalunya.

Like everyone else I was worried about the arrangements for getting the key but I was actually contacted by the Apartment people prior to boarding my plane. I was advised to contact them again when I was leaving Barcelone airport so we could a time. This all went like clockwork. We boarded the Airport bus into the city with the intention of getting off at Catalunya and following the directions given by another reviews (via metro). However when we noticed w the bus had stopped at Universaat and knowing this was one of the stations we were to go through on the way to the apartment we jumped off the bus. This proved to be a very good idea as it meant we only needed to get the metro from there and go the 2 stops to Tetuan. I would advise anyone to avoid at all costs making a change on the metro at Pasia de Gracia to the Purple line to Tetuan due to the distance between the 2 lines. (quite a lengthy corridor and a number of stairs) Once we got to Tetuan metro station the apartment was very easy found - if you come out the station by the right entrance (left hand side as you head through the ticket booth gates) the apartment block is just down to the left on the same pavement. We were met by a rep from the apartments who showed us around our accomodation and answered any queries we had. I also had to either leave a deposit or give my credit card details in case anything went missing during our stay! The apartment itself was lovely and very spaciuos.(we stayed on the 6th floor) We had a 3 bed apartment with 2 single beds in each room. One room had an en-suite and one had quite a large balcony. The only problem we had the whole time we where there was with the kettle! Its one of the old fashion kind that whistles when its done - it took ages! So if you like your tea, as we all did, pack a travel kettle with you. Our apartment had an iron and an iron board so we were sorted for that. We were advised to contact the apartment offices on the day of our departure to see if we could leave our suitcases there after the checking out time as our flight was not until later. This we did and thankfully we were able to do so. If the apartment was booked out that night I am not sure what we would have done. The only thing they did say was that when we returned to pick up our bags we were not to touch anything as the cleaner would have been in.. We did however \"use the facilities\" and got caught out by the cleaner who was not too impressed so be warned!

We were given a time to meet outside the apartments, and the guy was about 10 minutes late. Our room was on the 5th floor facing towards the back of the building. It overlooked some kind of school playground, which could be quite noisy at certain times of the day, but not many people go to Barcelona to stay in their apartment during the day! The apartment block was on a busy main road, and I would have thought the traffic would be quite noisy if you were in a front-facing apartment, although the view would have been better. The apartment had air-conditioning, so there was no need to open the window if you didn't want to. We had booked a two-bedroomed apartment with one bathroom, but were actually given a three-bedroomed, two-bathroomed apartment, which was extremely spacious. It was well-equipped with washer-dryer, fridge-freezer, microwave, iron etc, if you want those kind of things when on holiday. We booked through lastminute.com, which stated that there were also complimentary toiletries and a mini-bar. This was not the case (and I must admit, I wouldn't expect that sort of thing in an apartment). We queried it with the guy, who said that this was wrong and that it was lastminute who were at fault, as their own website did not offer these. I would describe the apartment as functional. It had everything we needed (the beds could have been a little bit softer, but I put some of the spare blankets under the bottom sheet, which helped a lot), but it did lack a bit of character. A few more pictures on the wall and perhaps a few cushions would have made it a little more cosy and inviting, but it was clean and served its purpose well. Certainly much better value than a hotel. The metro was right outside the door, and it only took a few minutes to get into the centre. We also walked sometimes, which took about 20 minutes. There were numerous small cafes in the vicinity, both opposite and just down the road, where you could eat breakfast very cheaply. On arrival we took the Renfe train from the airport to Passeig de Gracia, where we changed to the Metro (Pink Line, L2 direction La Pau) for the last short leg of the journey to Tetuan. At Tetuan, use the lift to street level. This proved to be a nightmare journey if you had more than the lightest bag with you as it involved walking up and down masses of steps (No convenient lifts or escalators on this particular bit of the Metro system) and walking long distances at Passeig de Gracia. We took the Renfe because it was free with our Barcelona Card (highly recommend buyiny this card - can buy it at the airport, or order online before you go and pick up at airport). When returning to the airport, we went by a much better route which I'd definitely recommend. Metro (Pink Line, L2 direction Parel.lel) as far as Universitat, and then change to the Red Line, L3 direction Fondo) for the one stop to the Catalunya Square, where you could pick up the airport bus for a couple of Euros (also discounted with the Barcelona Card). By using this route, there was only one set of 5 stairs, the rest of the time it was either escalators or lifts, and hardly any distance to walk. Airport buses go about every 10 minutes and take about 30 mins to reach the airport. Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Barcelona, and would definitely consider staying in these apartments again.", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "MH Apartments Tetuan", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d614991-Reviews-MH_Apartments_Tetuan-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "$153 - $309*", "Address": "<div class=\"amenFloat\">", "HotelID": "614991", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/cc/9a/cc9ad41c2dd61cc4a21d00aec7adb4718large.jpg"}}
