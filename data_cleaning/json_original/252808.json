Several other guests were equally inconvenienced but the Motel manager declined to give any kind of a refund or credit despite the fact the rooms were completely unusable in the morning, as of around 8am, which is completely outrageous. I was forced to stay there again recently due to a lack of available rooms elsewhere which was not so good, and again in the morning, this time around 11am, there was more banging. I can't say I wasn't warned. The Motel's easy access to several good eateries means little if guests have to deal with the kind of noise issues that usually take place in run down cheap apartment buildings everywhere.

I can't comment on the price as the stay was paid for by the University but I'll try to comment on everything else. This was a decent hotel. Not the best by far but not bad either. On the plus side the suite I had was very large. A decent size bedroom and a huge living room with a balcony, a desk, a sofa, a TV and a dining table. There was also a small kitchen with a fridge and a small supply of kitchen and cooking utensils. Given that I stayed in Montreal for full two weeks this came in very handy as I didn't want to eat out all the time. I also liked the location - near the University, a block away from a supermarket, near subway and public transport and with lots of small bistros and cafes around. My room faced away from the street so there were no issues with noise that some other reviewers mentioned. On the minus side, the place could definitely use some renovation as the rooms and the furniture are a bit run down. Also there is no central AC. There is a window AC unit in the living room but I had to run it full blast (which did get a bit loud) to cool everything including the bedroom. Also, there is no wired internet connection. There is free wireless but the connection is very spotty. One last tip. The hotel is some distance from downtown. To get to downtown you could take a subway (a couple of blocks away), a taxi or a bus. Subway actually takes a long time as one has to transfer twice. The best (cheap) option is to walk north along Cote-des-Neiges to the intersection with Chemin de la C\u00c3\u00b4te-Sainte-Catherine and take bus 129 which goes all the way to the old city.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. John's, Canada", "Title": "\u201cAmazing Location Wonderful Staff Great Value Very Clean\u201d", "Author": "rickcardo", "ReviewID": "UR113644877", "Content": "I was in Montreal for surgery and needed a long term hotel near the hospital.I chose this Jewel ....I stayed in one of the renovated rooms everything was wonderful...Clean Bright .

I stayed here for one week at the beginning of August. I was attending an academic meeting for which I had to prepare a tutorial on the final day, and I also had to complete some other work. I needed to spend quite a bit of time in the room doing work on my laptop. In the past, some hotel rooms have not afforded good working conditions - I was thrilled by the set-up of my suite at Hotel Terrasse Royale. I was in room 304, overlooking Cote-des-Neiges - it was perfect for people watching while I worked. The suite had an entryway complete with coat closet, a decent sized bathroom (tub with shower), a fairly small bedroom (large bed, dresser, 2 end tables, walk-in closet equipped with iron and ironing board), a living room (3 seater couch, arm chair, desk with chair, table with 3 chairs, coffee table, tv), and a kitchenette (full size microwave, small stove (4 burners, but only 1 large, narrow), apartment size fridge with freezer), coffee maker, kettle, toaster, bar sink, and all the utensils and dinnerware to make it work). The room was looking a little worn, but it was very clean and functional. I highly recommend this for anybody with a longer stay in Montreal. It was very affordable, particularly as you really don't need to eat out with the kitchen setup. Within a block of the hotel, there was a full size grocery store, a smaller high-end fruit/veggie/bread/deli/gourmet shop, and a very reasonably priced fresh fruit and veggie stand. There are also many small restaurants as well as some chains (St. Huberts, Nickels), but I only ate out a couple of times. I much preferred to cook myself something and relax in front of the tv before getting back to work. The hotel has a small laundry room downstairs - it cost $1.50 for the washer, $1.50 for the dryer, and I was able to buy detergent for the load for $1 from the front desk (who also could have made change if I needed it). The location was wonderful - just a block away from the Cote de Neiges metro station on the blue line. so access to most areas of the city was an easy ride. The neighbourhood has several interesting things as well - Mount Royal, the oratory, etc.. The front desk staff were great. I arrived very early and the only room ready did not have a kitchenette as booked - upon looking at the length of my stay (6 nights), the staff suggested that I wait until another room was ready. They kept my bag for me and I went across the road to the Second Cup where I had internet access, a scone, and some great tea sitting in the atrium in the back. Before returning, I did a quick grocery shop. The room was ready by 1:00 and I was able to check in. They also helped me figure out when to leave for an early morning flight, got me up in time, and arranged for the cab to the airport. Always service with a smile. I was so impressed with the comfort of my stay, I re-booked there for later this week when I will be attending a conference located downtown. Although I will have to take the metro to and from it, I think that the comfortable environment (really feeling at the end of the day like I am coming home because I have all the amenities of home) is worth the travel time (particularly with the metro being so handy). For my budget, any hotel downtown that I could have afforded would have been in the 2-2.5 star range. One downside is that as it is not located downtown, so transportation from the airport is not ideal. On the way to the hotel, I took the $15 airport bus to downtown and then took the metro to the hotel (took about 30 minutes) - on the way back, I took a cab for $27 (in the wee hours of the morning, so no traffic). The metro in Montreal is great, but it's not very accessible - most stations don't appear to have elevators or escalators, so if you are toting some bags, be aware that you may have to tote them up and down stairs. I'm going back next week and will stick to a cab.", "Date": "August 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "NS", "Title": "\u201cWonderful experience!\u201d", "Author": "NoahsMom73", "ReviewID": "UR34221925", "Content": "I was a little hesitant due to the mixed reviews I had read here, but wow!

It is very close to everything and anything you could need or want, with the exception of Tim Horton's. Not a big deal to me, but for my mother and my husband, it's an obstacle which can be overcome. My mother bought coffees on the way back from the Eaton Centre and brought them to the hotel, and my husband is planning to bring a one cup coffee maker and some Tim's coffee grounds with us when we return, later this month.

A Second Cup is across the street as is a 24 hour grocery store. Down the street is a fruit market, and it is within walking distance of Jewish General Hospital. DO NOT eat at Nickel's. It is a 50's diner across from the hotel. We thought it would be great, but the food is awful and it is hideously overpriced!!! There is a little coffee shop across from the hotel (not Second Cup) which serves food and it was wonderful and not badly priced at all. There is a bus stop right outside Shopper's and you can get a transfer to take you on the subway to the Eaton Centre. For two people, it cost only $5.25. Not bad!

The furniture was dated, the curtains, walls, etc. were ordinary, etc., and that was enough for her to object - strenuously. We had to leave.

Hotel Terrasse Royale is in an excellent location, in the Cote-des-Neiges neighborhood. Whereas downtown is dark and pretty isolated at night, my husband and I could step out the hotel lobby in the evenings and stroll up and down the street. It's a lively area, with lots of people walking and shopping at all hours. There are at least two 24 hour cafes across the street, a grocery, pharmacy, and fruit/fromagerie as well. There's an outdoor market down the block, and the metro subway is a couple blocks. That said, the hotel itself is very nice. These are large studio apartments, 1-bedrooms and 2 bedroom efficiencies. We stayed a week in the studio for about $700 canadian including tax. The room was huge compared to standard hotel rooms. It had a very comfy king-sized bed, a sitting room with a couch and chair and tv, a walk-in closet, a little kitchen with micro, toaster, sink and little fridge/freezer, plus plates, silverware, etc. The bathroom was standard. Most importantly, for me at least, is that the hotel is spotless! I'm basically a freak about hotel beds, mostly grossed out at your standard 3 and 4 star hotels. Not here!! The linens were soft and crisp, the mattress was pillow top, and the pillows were all lined under the pillow cases. The bottom sheet was well tucked around the mattress (I hate when you can see the mattress). There was daily maid service, and they had no problem sending up extra pillows. The staff at the front desk were real friendly and helpful. A bonjour or bon soir and then proceed in English. (The whole of the city is bilingual without hesitation.) Parking was more convenient than any hotel I've ever been in, honestly. Downstairs, beneath the building...an automatic door directly on Cote-des- Neiges. Only $10 a day, with in and out privileges. I did take a look at the larger suites before leaving (they were full up with a bus tour when we checked in, and the staff offered to let us switch rooms when they tour cleared out, but we were so happy with the studio we stayed put). The larger rooms would be great for couples travelling together, or travelling with kids. The only negative I heard was from another American couple staying in one of the front suites with the balcony, that they could hear the traffic at night, but that it wasn't too bad. My husband and I were in a side room, with a view of the sunset and partial view of the street and slept with the windows wide open, and didn't notice the street noise at all. There is a cafe off the lobby which is convenient for breakfast. There's a bookstore and cafe next door, and many stores and restaurants right on the blocks surrounding the hotel. The St Joseph's oratory is in view from the lobby entrance, hence the bus tours. The Vietnamese restaurant a couple doors down is fantastic! And be sure to visit the several large markets, such as the Jean-Talon market for a great experience, all easily accessible from the metro or by car!

The bedroom part is private, with a door which separates it from the living room/kitchen area. My room had two big beds, a chest drawer, and a big walk-in closet.
