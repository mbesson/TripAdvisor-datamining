{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Terrific value We stayed at the Fox Delicias for one night before our trip back to the US from Ponce airport. Some of the reviews on this website scared us a bit, but reviews from the guide books persuaded us to change our mind. This hotel is centrally located in Ponce Plaza, and right next to most of the major attractions. In fact with its quirky history and quaint architecture, this hotel is one of those attractions that tourists would run through on their quick half day visit to Ponce. The entrance is grand (which speaks to its origins to as a theater), and the lobby is like a mall (which was its previous avataar). We stayed in a king suite, which had two rooms wih a total of 3 beds that could fit 6 people in all. The room was clean, TV and AC worked fine, and the front desk staff was very helpful with directions (and fluent in English!). The three or four major attractions of Ponce - the firehouse, church and the old mayor's house - were all right in front of the hotel. Several good restaurants are within 5 minutes. Overall, it was great value for $135 including taxes. Yes, the criticisms of other reviews are valid to an extent. The hotel is being run by a bank now since the previous operator went under (or so I was told by locals at dinner). The ban being a bank is not conected well to travel agents, so the hotel is never full. On our trip, about 8 rooms were occupied out of the 30. They try to save money by dimming the lights and not running the mall escalators, but it is as dark as the fashionably dark Ws, and there are working escalators should one choose not to climb the stairs. My principal quibble was with the free parking lot, which is on a side street and one has to take the key from the front desk. There's strong police presence and we went to the lot at 4.00 AM for our early AM flight without feeling unsafe, but ladies may feel uncomfortable. Overall, I'd say this is a good, quant alternative to the Hiltons and Howard Jonhsons, good value and the location cannot be beat.", "Date": "Dec 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR549616854", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "FrmNJ"}, {"Content": "Scary Valet parking as promised was non-existent, fountain not working, lobby musty and so dark we stumbled on the way to dek.

I stayed in Ponce for 2 nights, and decided to try to Fox Delicias Hotel. Everything looks nice from the pictures, so I decided to try it. However, everything was different when I got there. I am all for conserving energy and whatnot, but when you walk into the hotel, the lights are so dim, that they seem almost off. And the escalator was not working. I figured that was just for the night, but it wasn't on at all my entire stay. My room had a damp and musty smell, as did the other one they put me in.The hotel has a restaurant and a buffet like place, but apparently it is closed on the weekends. They fail to mention that on their website. When I asked the receptionist where to go for food, she could only name a few of places, and most of them weren't close by.Later on the night of my first stay, someone in the room next to me I guess decided to tamper with the smoke alarm at 11pm, so they alarm rang for about an hour. Their maintenance crew decided to work on the problem, but constantly until 530am. The staff at the front desk was not helpful, and did not want to reimburse us, or at least give us a considerable discount on our stay. They had no recollection of the incident, and only gave us a 10% discount. They were not willing to work with us, and honestly could seem to care less about what happened.Definitely if I travel back to Ponce, I will not stay in this hotel.

I made a special trip last week while on the island to check all this out firsthand. Well the mall went busted some years back and it has been converted into a hotel. The expensive escalators still sit idle in the center of the long narrow building. The rooms are clean and modern but as mentioned in another review sterile, and it is true that the help knows nothing about the surroundings nor about the elegant buildings history. The night of check in I was told the hotel was only half full. The next AM I finally talked myself into staying in Ponce a second day and about 5 till noon which is their checkout time I was informed when I went to pay another night that the hotel was totally booked and I was literally given 5 minutes to pack everything up and get it out of the room or pay another 74.00 late charge! What a shock! It was muggy and humid and I really had my hands full with two heavy suitcases and counting the minutes and an attendant was watching from the corridor! The only good thing that came out of all this is the naive young girl at the desk mentioned Guanica and La Pargera which are sleepy seaside towns about 30 minutes away and they were the most fun of my entire weeks stay on the island! The restaurant and bar remaining in the hotel sit empty as the chef took off for a better job in Miami so there are no hot meals available there. And as already mentioned in a review the whole downtown drops dead at 6 PM and the only activity around the beautiful park at night is the purchase of ice cream. Ninety percent of the shops surrounding the 400 million dollar renovation downtown are tacky dollar stores filled with Chinese junk. Other than the visit to the Seralles Castle the city was a major disappointment. I did not spend a second night in Ponce but made it to la Pargera after the Serralles museum-mansion tour and had a splendid weekend!", "Date": "Sep 27, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR286211635", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Rioguy"}, {"Content": "The Haunted Hotel Fox Delicias is a skeleton of a great hotel. Efforts to conserve energy and staffing are imediately apparent--the darkness of the lobby area, the escalator that never runs, the air conditioner that's set on 85 degrees, and the food court that doesn't ever seem to be open for business. The emptiness creates a creepy vibe. It's possible to spend a whole night there and never see another guest, even though you know they're there. Potential guests should also be aware that many of the rooms do not have windows. Fox Delicias--the ghost hotel. But what the Fox Delicias lacks in amenities and atmosphere it makes up for in its location and price. Situated in the heart of Ponce's historic district, the best restaurants and tourist sites are within easy walking distance. And we felt safe in the surrounding neighborhood. There's a heavy police presence in the area, as well as a police precinct on the other side of the plaza. My wife and I walked around the plaza across the street from the hotel late at night eating our gelados. The hotel's energy conservation can be seen on the bill. We stayed at the hotel for two weekday nights in February (high season) and only paid $59 a night. Other good points were the relaxing courtyard, where we planned our itinerary and wrote postcards. The hotel's art deco facade is also unique and beautiful. The price and location are the reasons why we enjoyed our stay at the Fox Delicias Hotel. For those of you looking for luxury, stay away.

The hotel seemed empty and dark. Our room was a 2 bedroom suite without windows. The main room was large with 2 queen beds and the second room was adequate with 1 double bed. There was a total of 4 people in our party. The room was clean but sterile. There was no refrigerator, microwave, iron or ironing board that one might expect from a suite. The escalators were not operational and the air conditioning was not on in the public areas. It was pretty hot and humid. The hotel only had food between 11:00am-2:00pm. We had a problem with the temperature control in our room. We were either too hot or too cold for one night. The manager on site compensated us for the night of discomfort.Although the staff was plesant and willing to help, they didn't seem to know much about Ponce. There were no brochures about sights in the hotel. No list of local restraunts. The hotel was centrally located, inexpensive, outside area nicely renovated and they had valet  parking making checking in and out simple.We were there during the week and the town pretty much closes down after 6:00pm. We were told that the weekend are pretty active.Other reviews made us leary of the safety in the area. But we never really felt unsafe at all. I would stay at the hotel again and recommend it to others that want the most from there dollar and stay in the heart of the town.

Great prices, location, service, staff!! Worth every penny I just returned from a trip to Ponce  then Vieques Puerto Rico. There was a large group of us that went down there for a wedding. We had researched EVERYTHING we possibly could for this trip. I used tripadvisor so much I told myself I'd leave a review to help the future travelers in the same situation we were in. Fox Delicia was wonderful!! Phillipe was the gentleman working at the front desk and was very energetic, helpful, and filled with information. He recommended a great breakfast/bakery just a 1/2 block off the main square, and this amazing ice cream place. He told us how to get around the town and let us know the great shopping and sites to see. Three of us arrived on Thursday in the early evening and checked in. We had to get ready for the wedding rehearsal. My husband called the front desk to ask for an iron and ironing board, b/c there were not any in the room. Within 5 minutes we had one at our door. My husband then asked the gentleman if they also had a hair dryer. (we werent able to bring all of the items we needed due to luggage constrants we had due to a 9 passenger plane we had to fly on at the end of our trip in Vieques) But 2 minutes later we had our hair dryer too. They were so accomodating. The other 6 people from our group arrived at 5am from their flight and the front desk was great enough to let them check in early and not charge us for that extra night or time. We had booked just the 2bedroom suite the first night in case the people couldnt check in, and then needed a place to sleep for a few hours before the checkin time. They gave the other members of our group the adjoined room next to ours and made sure we had everything we needed. It was clean  quiet.

The restaurant, unfortunately for me, does not offer any vegetarian items, so I'm unable to rate it's quality. Though, for the time I was there, I did not see very many people dining in it at all. The poor hostess was standing outside the empty restaurant for hours on end. On exploring the other restuarants within a close walking distance, it seemed like everyone in the area was having dinner at Marks, in the Hotel Melia, across the square. Again, no real vegetarian entrees, so I moved on. I finally ended up down the block from Fox's at Chef's Creation, which, while they didn't have very much in line of Veg. fare, they were very accomodating and helpful and the Chef and wait staff went all out to make sure that we were well fed. (The Pina Colada's here are awesome too, btw).Anyway, that's just more general info about Ponce than about Fox's, I'll save the rest of those details for the Ponce review. Would I stay at Fox again? Yeah, probably. It wasn't a bad experience at all aside from the lack of natural light in the rooms.

Nice hotel and very good location in the center of town. Hotel was recommended to us by our friend who lives in Ponce. Clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Perhaps would be nice to stay where there is a pool or closer to the beach but we had fun staying in the actual town surrounded by the daily activities of the townspeople.

The hotel is located in the center of Ponce and was very nicely decorated. The hotel staff was great and extremely helpful. I really liked the hotel, but did have some problems. Only two of the thirty rooms have windows. I felt like I was in a closet. The biggest problem that I encountered was the lack of sound proofing in the rooms. I could hear everything that was happening next door. This was specially a problem at 5:00 A.M. when my neighbors decide to make whoopee and let everybody know about it. I do not think this is a great place to take a family because of this. I felt extremely safe around the hotel because of the high police present.", "Date": "Aug 3, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR941487355", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Fantastic! 1.

Good Points:1. Clean new furniture. Bedsheets, pillows, furniture, bathroom fixtures are new.2. Extremely attentive and polite staff. They gave us maps and guidance on where to visit. No attempt to ask for tips. When we asked to leave the car in the hotel parking even after we checked out, they gave us several hours of grace period.3. Central location directly facing the main Plaza Delicias so you are walking distance to many main attractions.4. Beautiful pink and white art deco facade. The courtyard is guarded by a large iron gate facing the Plaza. There is 24 hour security/valet attendant in front.5. Air conditioning is phenomenal. In your room, you get a remote controlled unit which controls the actual centigrade degree.6. Spacious lobby and open lounge spaces on both floors.7. Excellent security. They use a modern key-card lock system.8. They have excellent laundry service and only charged 10 bucks.Bad Points:1. Inbound phone calls to your room will cost 1 dollar each.According to the Hotel clerk, this hotel was built 5 months ago, so it's not even in the annual editions of your tipical travel guide books. Hurrah.The Fox Delicias hotel is on site of a previous Fox Delicias Mall which went out of business.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR731249010", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "baires"}, {"Content": "Loved the Fox Delicias Loved the newness of it. but if you like a room with a view, this hotel is not for you.
