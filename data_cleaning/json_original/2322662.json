The hotel is filled with very chic women in fur coats and staggeringly high heels, so if you like people watching, this is a great place to park yourself (we saw Nikki Hilton in the hotel bar). We booked the standard (wonderful) room, and found the room a decent size for a hotel in Paris, and it came with all the modern amenities as expected, iphone chargers etc. There is also some seriously good chocolate in the mini bar. The breakfast is pricey (45 euro) and wasn't included in our standard room rate, but worth experiencing at least once - the service was great, and they had hot soup, the freshest croissants ever, as well as eggs done in many styles (I had the poached egg with salmon and it arrived topped with fish roe - super yummy). The hotel restaurant has an excellent chef at the helm, and served really good tapas. Worth trying at least once - and DO book ahead, because it was closed for a private event the first night that we were there, and FULL the next night. The hotel bathrooms are glass, and not nearly frosted enough if you are traveling with a business associate! Be warned also that there are no places to hang towels inside the shower area without getting them wet. All in, the hotel is WOW, for location and cool factor. Worth checking out in Paris!", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Delhi", "Title": "\u201cShocking\u201d", "Author": "Vikas S", "ReviewID": "UR126134983", "Content": "Shocking hotel given the price they charge.

The room was pretty large for Paris hotels and amazing views of the Opera. Location is great 2 mins walk from major department stores, opposite a metro stop and place vendome. The staff were so helpful and are really motivated and make you feel really welcome. Love the W beds and quirky design features. The bar was very cool and had a live DJ and a huge list of cocktails. The breakfast was very noval with a private buffet served at every table. I would stay at this hotel again in a flash. A very luxury hotel but all with a very W feel.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cVery disappointing\u201d", "Author": "310MrG", "ReviewID": "UR125944360", "Content": "I took my wife here to celebrate her birthday. The location and building were superb but sadly that's where we stopped being impressed. The hotel had been open for three days and already looked dated, the staff were still in the process of being trained so whilst all were very friendly service was very slow. The room had a very comfortable bed but the accommodation was cramped with a very strange bathroom set up that had a tiny toilet and no bath. The door to the room allied all external sounds through and we were woken by work still being done to the hotel at 5am. We also heard all the music from the bar until late into the night- not what you'd expect from 5 star hotel. We returned from a day out in Paris to find the room hadn't been made up. Personally I thought very poor value for the money.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Barcelona, Spain", "Title": "\u201cGreat experience\u201d", "Author": "Javier A", "ReviewID": "UR125659026", "Content": "I was last week with my wife at the w hotel in Paris.
