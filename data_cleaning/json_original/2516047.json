Super 8 far surpassed my expectations. It is tucked away on busy Washington Blvd yet very very quiet. I really liked the fact that parking was ample even on a Friday night [not so at Travelodge]. I was in room 129, in the back on the 2nd level [no elevator so pack lite]. The location in West LA/Culver City is perfect: not far from the airport and near Fox Hills Mall which has plenty of shops and restaurants [Lucille's BBQ was delicious!!]. The room was perfect as mentioned by other reviewers. It was very clean, spacious and comfortable. There were two beds, a living room area with couch, chair, table and flat panel television. Also included is a breakfast/dinner nook area with fridge, microwave, table and chairs, perfect for morning coffee and breakfast or dinner. I also really appreciated the window in the bathroom, a small pleasure but nonetheless a pleasure. I also liked the large dressing room, big enough for an ironing board. Also there were plenty of electrical outlets for all your electrical devices. This was TERRIFIC as I had to plug in camera batteries, phones, mp3 players and a tablet. Of note; however, were the small beds. I am 5'10 and my feet came right to the edge of the bed. Anyone taller than that will have to sleep at an angle, no joke. The couch and chairs are also on a smaller scale. Fine for me but anyone larger might not be as comfortable. I did not try the pool, but it looked very inviting. I also did not try the limited breakfast.

First off, the receptionists are very friendly and knowledgeable. Everything went smooth and quick, was told about great places to eat and how to get to some of the site seeing places easily, and had great attitudes. Our room suprised me the most, it was up to date on the furniture, bedding, floors the whole lot. Everything was very clean and very presentable. There is a bathroom window that you really can see out of unless you wanting to look, but there isn't anything to see as it's just the back of some buildings. All the front windows will overlook the parking lot. The pool was kept very clean from what I noticed, they do have a snack machine nearby as well. If I had to make one suggestion about the whole thing, it would have been that I would have liked to have day curtains in the window. There were only black out curtains and if you wanted to have light come in, the whole world could easily look in. But that would be it. That and the horrible traffic that fills all the streets from the afternoon on. But that's pretty much to be expected around these parts. We ate at 2 of the places we were recommended, one across the street at an outdoor grill type place. Delicious food! The other was a Mexican restaurant around the corner next to a Chinese place. One plate would fill 2 people easily, the selection was great, the staff was very nice and on top of everything. A good place to have a drink and walk back to the hotel. The neighborhood was very safe, no problems whatsoever. The bus stop was just a block away that can take you down to Hollywood, every bus driver was just as nice and helpful as everyone we've been fortunate to talk to. Venice Beach is a straight shot down, not even 10 minutes. The Dollar Store was within a 5 minute walking distance, just incase you forgot anything. Lots of other stores and places to eat as well. The continental breakfast wasn't really anything to write about, it made up of 2 cereal types, some packaged pastries from Costco, orange juice, milk and coffee.

Clean, comfortable, and spacious room. Only about US$71 per night before taxes. We occupied room #116, which was a 1 King Bed room. Free WiFi Internet service was quick and reliable. The only complaints would be that the showerhead and coffee pot could be a tad cleaner, and the fridge froze our fruit in the middle of the Min/Med setting, but nothing major.

We carry Clorox disinfectant wipes, and we wiped everywhere: door knobs, remote, countertops,nightstands, even the showerhead. Guess what showed up - NOTHING ! This place was spotless ! I even dropped something behind the refrigerator, and that's usually dusty and dirty. Even behind the fridge was spotless ! Hats off to the cleaning people - I wish my house was this clean ! After passing that test, everything else was easy. Here's what we got for $71. A comfortable bed and pillows, good sized, quiet room with a vaulted ceiling, a great tv with tons of choices, and with 6 HBO channels! A new microwave and small refrigerator/freezer, hairdryer, even an extra toothbrush/toothpaste, razor and gel awaited us (along with the standard shampoo/conditioner,coffee and maker). Even a laptop we could use in the lobby. And breakfast - we had a choice between 4 cereals, pastries, toast, english muffins, apple and orange juice, tea, coffee. A great way to start the day, with the sunshine waking us up while we ate. It's been years since we got so much for so little, especially in Los Angeles ! $71 for all this? I wouldn't have believed it. Like all of you who haven't been to LA before, we were concerned about the neighborhood. After staying there a week we can say we never felt uncomfortable at the motel or the area. In fact, Culver seemed very clean, quiet, and with some nice restaurants. Pitfire pizza has great food and fun atmosphere. IN n out burgers are a tradition in LA, but they're so-so. The fries are what really stood out, like fresh potatoes. There's even a COSTCO a mile away. What a great location to explore from. Just a few minutes from the beach, Hollywood, Rodeo Drive, Venice, anywhere you want to go. Just go during non rush hours to cross the city to Griffith Park, Glendale, Pasadena, etc. The staff was great as well, very responsive. The only problem we had was with a bad iron and they replaced it immediately. If only our future stays at other hotels could be this nice !We stayed at this Super 8 for the entire week in LA, and couldn't have been more pleased with the accomodations, the staff, the location, the amenities, the incredible value (w/ AAA we paid $71/night). If we had another 7 days we'd have stayed here, that's how much we liked it. We usually stay at Marriott Courtyards, places like that. This was just as nice if not better. But all our fears and anxiety about where and what we stayed in were gone after the first night. If you're going to explore LA for a vacation, I can't imagine finding a better value/location than this Culver City gem. Oh, and FREE PARKING ! At $20+/day at other places, that adds up fast. ps, we didn't realize that Super 8 is part of Wyndham hotels, so you can add points to your Wyndham account if you have one.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cYes, Yes, Yes, this is the place you want in LA.\u201d", "Author": "Bolotet", "ReviewID": "UR86366062", "Content": "Most important thing about this hotel: if you are thinking this area is not good to explore LA, you are probably wrong.

Restaurants and shopping, including a Costco, are nearby, The hotel is well maintained and the grounds crew were busy taking care of the landscaping and pool regularly. The cleaning staff know their stuff and were helpful if we needed something. If there are any draw backs it is that the breakfast is very simple. This isn't a complaint, but if somebody is expecting a big spread with fancy pastry this isn't the place. There are a couple kinds of cereal, milk, juice, coffee, some packaged sweets, and bread for toast. Nobody will starve. Besides, the price is good and includes wireless Internet at no charge.
