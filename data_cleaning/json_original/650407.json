I believe the resort was under new management which really showed in the lack of service and training to staff. For example our booking had been misplaced so we had to wait 1 hour to be booked in. Then the rooms were not as booked -this created an uncomfortable atmosphere for quite some time. No order we placed was ever correct, the balinese staff working there appeared to be intimidated by management. There were not enough staff to people staying there, plates etc sat for days waiting to be collected. It is definetly not the place to go if you want to experience the true Bali spirit. Lucky for us we had spent a week at Candi Dasa so had experienced the true Bali hospitality. I would not recommend any one to stay there under the current management regime.", "Date": "May 31, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR982208074", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "mazaAustralia"}, {"Content": "really enjoyed this resort my partner and i spent a week at this resort and really enjoyed it. the facilities were good the staff great and we found it very clean.

Rooms are clean  comfortable, staff very friendly  helpful. Food @ the restaurant was reasonable  delicious.

Viewed resort on web site and were looking forward to paradise! Not quite what we found. Very tired and worn. Rooms not clean (looked behind bed to chase lizard and found real mess.) no resemblance to what was on web site.Moved to 5* hotel in Nusa Dua and found paradise. Cost less too and we got breakfast thrown in.

Jimbaran Hills was clean and comfortable most certainly. The rooms themselves were not luxurious by any means, but definitely clean. They felt a little dated, but not outside the realm of what I would expect from a timeshare. Although the balconies were great. The pool was fantastic, my husband especially loved the waterslide. The restaurant is good and staff incredibly friendly. There is a guy on site to book tours from. They were in the process of building a giant expansion, and I'd assume that's done by now, so the dated feeling may be taken care of. The major downside is that it's a 20 minute busride to get anywhere, IE Kuta for shopping, site seeing etc. Some people probably really like that. Especially families etc. We were honeymooners, young and ready to explore.We stayed at Jimbaran Hills because my uncle gave us a week in a timeshare as a wedding present. We definitely enjoyed it. That said, it was our least favorite of the places we stayed while on Bali and we would probably not stay there again. This had more to do with the location than anything else. If you're looking for somewhere away from the hub-bub of the beach and the cities, this is perfect. If you want to be closer to the action, I would find another place. In other parts of Bali we had places we simply adored and would be happy to recommend.", "Date": "Jun 5, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR807031482", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "AmberMH"}, {"Content": "Not what we expected       View from room at", "Date": "Apr 15, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR921105846", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "Pee"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297696-d650407-r20583447-Jimbaran_Hills_Resort_Spa-Jimbaran_Nusa_Dua_Peninsula_Bali.html", "HotelID": "650407", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
