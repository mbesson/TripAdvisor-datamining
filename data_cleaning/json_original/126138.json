We basically had no other options because we had to book our trip late and the college kids were in town for spring break. We arrived and they put us in a room with 2 double beds, no Sleep Number bed. The front desk gave me no help so the 3rd party had to call on my behalf. The hotel admitted they had overbooked, had no rooms with Sleepnumber beds, and refunded me just $20. The rooms were just so so, not dirty but in so so shape. The room looked worn, not even close to the type of room I'd expect for the price. The pool area seemed fine, although we didn't use it. A shuttle was available to take guests downtown for free every half hour, that was nice especially since the hotel is nowhere near the \"action\" in Key West. The continental breakfast in the a.m. was fairly nice....cereal, toast, bagels, yogurt, eggs, sausage, coffee, juice, waffle makers, etc. I recommend looking around and finding a nicer place if you are spending this type of money. We can afford the price, but still feel ripped off to pay this for a room I couldnt wait to check out of.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, Nevada", "Title": "\u201cOverated!!!\u201d", "Author": "Manateelover25", "ReviewID": "UR126164203", "Content": "I chose this hotel based on all the reviews here on Trip Advisor- and i honeslty think that people are blinded by the fantstic view and the pool area- Which are both wonderful and the staff was very nice as well- however this hotel is in very poor condition! the first room we were given on the fifth floor facing the water had a great view- small room, outdated furnishings and decor,tile floor, stained chair and the binder that had all the hotel info in it had pen scribbles throughout the whole thing- but the worst part was that the door locks have obviously been replaced, and what has been left after the conversion is about a four by two inch gap in the door frame, right where the lock is, not safe at all- i mean how could you change the locks and not secure the huge hole in the door frame? I was disappointed in this and went to the front desk, they gave us the key to the room next door, the doorframe was the same exact way!! and this room had carpet, but it was all ripped up and stained!! i was quite stunned at what i found, also there was no microwave, we decided on keeping our original room and asked for a microwave, in the meantime i went next door to the Comfort Suites to check out their hotel only to find the same front desk clerk who checked us in, i guess both these properties are run by the same company, when i came back i received a call from the front desk staff advising us there were no microwaves available, but they were going to upgrade us to a suite! wow that was wonderful and very good customer service as i was visably disturbed by what i had found at the hotel, We moved into a six floor suite, one of only four i believe on the water side, while were happy to get the upgrade, again the disrepair of the room was a real let down for me. Knobs were missing off of drawers and the closet in the living room, the sofa table was so wobbly that you could barely set anything on it, in the bedroom the mirrod closet door was missing a door, the ceiling was like a 30 year old ceiling that had major water damage and bad patch jobs. there were no pillows or bed linens for the pull out sofa bed,and our door didnt close all the way without slamming it. Also for two days the elavator would not stop on the fourth floor for patrons. I understand the climate can make things difficult, however there is no excuse to change the locks and not secure the door frames, and all the broken or missing items out of the rooms, and we saw three, were very disapointing in a major chain that i have come to love, in fact that same week we stayed at two different Comfort Suites in Miami for four days and our stays were excellent and usually are for this chain.

The room had a terrible odor as if the carpets had never been cleaned. We took the sheets off the 2nd queen and laid them on the floor to walk on in our bare feet after our shower. There is or was no microwave, so don't think about bringing any leftovers back to room to eat later. The serve yourself American breakfast was something to be desired. We watched them microwave a bag of eggs for the scrambled eggs (not good) and then microwaved some frozen hockey pucks that turned out to be the sausage. So, we opted for the fruit, browning banana's, and oranges that you could not peel, they were very tough thin skinned and nothing but pulp on the inside. (no real flavor). There also is no shuttle to downtown, you have to walk a block to the next hotel for the trolly. I read someones blog that said they had a sleep number bed, ours was not and was never offered a room with one, and we never seen any advertisement for them.

This hotel was exactly what me and my friends were looking for. We arrived Sunday to spend the day in Key West but upon our arrival the day was so nice we decided to rent a hotel for the night and really enjoy ourselves. As soon as we entered Key West we began calling Hotels to check for availability and pricing. All the hotels were either around or above the rate we received for the Comfort Inn, so we booked it. We were literally 1 minute from the hotel in a parking lot when we did book it and once we arrived the room was already ready for us to check-in to. The room was very clean and spacious. Nothing crazy out of this world but never the less it was a clean comfy room. The beds are sleep number beds, which really didn't make a difference to us as they were already at a comfortable setting once we arrived. There was even space to throw in a small (single/full) inflatable bed. There are also ice machines and coke vending machines on each floor so you don't have to go far for ice. The pool area looked very fun, even though we never got in it. There were a lot of people enjoying it from kids to older adults. Upon check-in they gave us 3 vouchers for drinks at the bar which comes in handy. Definitely felt like you were in Key West while hanging out there. Another great convenience was the fact that this hotel offered free breakfast in the morning. Not sure quite what was offered since we never went but I heard it lasted to around 10am which is a lot longer than most hotels. We did however visit the Denny's located next to the Lobby downstairs after we checked out. The service there was a bit slow but expected since everyone was checking out after a long weekend. There is plenty of parking in the front and in the rear of the hotel. So no need to worry about paying for parking (very common in Key West) or having to hustle your way for parking passes if your party has multiple vehicles. Also nice was the fact that directly in front of the hotel was a stop for the Trolley that takes you around Key West if you don't want to drive. There also was a place to rent scooters/electric cars really nearby if you rather do that. Nice options to have if you plan on visiting Duval Street/Mallory Square since it is about 5-10 mins from the hotel. MY ONLY complaint about this hotel is the elevators. They only have 2 elevators (one in the front by the entrance of the lobby and the other by the side/pool area) and BOTH are pretty slow and HOT! But this is nothing that really inconvenienced us or caused us to have a bad time. In conclusion if you plan on traveling to Key West and are contemplating this hotel don't worry. You will get a good place at a good price.

The bedspread was outdated and we immediately removed it from the bed to avoid touching it anymore than needed. The chairs were stained due to age and the tub didn't drain very quickly (and I love standing in a pool of water while showering). The room we had was a smoking room (we don't smoke so that was wonderful). Do hotels even allow smoking anymore? Apparently this one didn't get the memo. This is pretty much a dump and for a few dollars more, I am sure you can stay at a much nicer hotel (and trust me, you will want to). This hotel is hanging on by a thread and while they seem to sell out (at least that is what they told us), I would recommend tearing it down and starting over.

We did eat the free breakfast most mornings, which was nice to have. There is also a Denny's attached to the hotel and free wifi which worked great. Going back to the point that Key West is $$$$, the location is not great. I knew this upon booking the hotel and wanted/needed to save some $$$$ so that I could afford the attractions. I traveled with my Mother and we rented bikes to get around downtown. That worked, but what this hotel should possibly do is offer shuttle buses like some of the other hotels nearby offer.
