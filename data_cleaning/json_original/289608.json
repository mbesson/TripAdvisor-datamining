I have lived in Madrid for over a year and have often looked for accommodation for visiting friend and family so I am pretty familiar with the \"hostal scene\" of the town. Among all the places I have seen, this is definitely a real find! Location is perfect, right off Calle Arenal: 5 minutes walk from the Opera House and the Royal Palace on one side, and 5 minutes walk from Puerta del Sol on the other side (and 2 metro stops at the same distance!). Beside the quite shabby entrance to the building (which is a constant of Madrid's hostels which seem to never have well groomed entrances!) the hostel was a surprise. After a very quick check in, I was assigned a small (I was alone so it was a single room) but incredibly neat and clean room with a nice window on the street below. The bathroom was once again small but super clean and functional. The rooms was basic but perfectly comfortable and well cared for. They serve no breakfast (as in all the hostals) but right below, on Calle Arenal, there are about 1000 bars and coffee places, including Starbucks. I paid 45 euros per night for a room with private bathroom and I'm sure I'll stay here when I go back next time. I could never find something so cheap and comfy in such a central location! Since it's only a few steps away. if your are coming back from a crazy disco night (Joy is just a few stesp away) stop at the Chocolateria San Gines (Pasadizo San Gin\u00e9s, 5) and have the best churros con chocolate in town :-)", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Naples, Italy", "Title": "\u201cvery good, try it and you`ll see\u201d", "Author": "corinaZ", "ReviewID": "UR124769281", "Content": "A very good accommodation in the centre of the city that I will recommend without hesitation.

In order to get here, look on google maps, it is very simple and close to Opera subway station. The rooms are quite ok, maybe the single looks a little bit small, because it has a large queen bed. But the bathroom is larger than I expected. You`ll get everything, from every day cleaning and minibar, to AC, WiFi (perfectly functional when I was there), fresh towels daily, etc. There is also a computer in the hall. Well, try to ring long when you arrive, because sometimes the person from the reception is somewhere in the hostel. The only problems I encountered were: the temperature(either breathtakingly hot, or chilly\u2026and I was there in February..) and the inner noise. About the noise, it is the first time for me when I experience noise done by the staff, speaking loud in Spanish most of the day, sometimes screaming orders and shouting, and always wearing high and very noisy heels. No chance to sleep after 8 AM. Obviously, no nap allowed in the afternoon. A, and no one speaks English, but this is smth we are used to in Spain.

I initially had a problem with them, but it was resolved in a few days. The problem was that my credit card was charged for all the days of my stay right away, instead of the 1 day deposit as stated on the website and on the receipt. I initially received a rather rude reply (stating that they don't take credit cards and couldn't possibly have charged my card), but after I sent them a copy of my receipt, I got a refund for the other days and a polite note saying there was a problem with the website. The staff does speak English which is important to me, but the man who is there during the day speaks English poorly and was rather surly and seemed to be in a rush, making it seem like I was in his way or disrupting his day or somehow inconveniencing him. The lady who works the evening/night shift speaks much better English and was very polite and answered all my questions.

However, my room was modern, clean, bright and cheerful, if not exactly large. Staff were helpful, and all spoke some English. I couldn't get the free WiFi to work with my laptop, but they had two internet conected PC's available free for guests to use. No food in the hostal, but plenty of places to eat nearby.
