{"Reviews": [{"Content": "One Night Only West Hotel - JordanThe West Hotel is a downmarket budget hotel that seems to cater primarily for large groups from the Chinese Mainland and backpackers. It is not in the nicest of streets, a pretty grotty road called Wai Sing Street, just off Jordan Road. The lobby area is small but welcoming. When I checked in I was fortunate enough to arrive just before a coach full of tourists. There were 2 receptionists on duty and when I came back down 20 mins later they were still trying to process the tour group.There are two lifts (one of which was undergoing maintenance) so I guess that there can be quite a wait during busy times. I was up on the 20th floor and to say that the walls are paper thin is a bit of an understatement (note to the man in room 2003, if you asked your wife to do that for you, I would expect a one way ticket to the divorce court !). The rooms are very small but are quite clean. There is no bath and the shower cubicle is miniscule. The hot water in the shower is exceptionally hot and the cold is exceptionally cold. After much experimentation, including scalding and freezing, I managed to get it just right. There is no wardrobe, just a small area to hang some clothes - 5 to be precise. There is a very small unit in the room to put some clothes in. There is no in room safe. There is a small working desk and chair but there is no power point that I can see. The room itself is very clean as is the bathroom. A complimentary toothbrush and toothpaste are in the bathroom. They provide a kettle and a couple of tea bags. There is a fridge in the room which is useful to store milk. There are several 7-11 stores and a very well hidden Wellcome Supermarket very close at hand. The room I was 2002, had a wall mounted TV screen. The only stations I was ale to pick up were local ones. I could not get BBC or CNN, in fact I could not pick up any English Language stations. The bed was very hard, but that does concern me since I prefer a hard bed. Some people may think otherwise. So some conclusions. The West Hotel is listed in some directories as a 3 star property - it isn\u9225\u6a9b. The location alone is enough to drop it down the star ratings. The fact that the taxi driver, who spoke very good English, did not know the location of the hotel, speaks volumes about it. The rooms are small, the bathroom especially. The rooms are clean - no complaints there. As a hotel it is better than the Bridal Tea House chain and better than a hostel. It does not rank with the Kimberley or the Wharney, which are both allegedly 3 or 4 star properties. It is, I guess, bordering between a one star and a two star. The rack rate comes out at HKD 1100 a night - don\u9225\u6a9b consider paying that. I would not pay more than HKD 750 a night and that is top end of the scale. If you need somewhere to stay for one night, then I guess its ok, anymore and it\u9225\u6a9a a non-starter. Thank God I have moved on to the BP", "Date": "Dec 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR171578235", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "steve_ben2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294217-d1191444-r22511351-West_Hotel-Hong_Kong_Hong_Kong_Region.html", "HotelID": "1191444", "Price": "\" id=\"hotel_1191444\">"}}
