{"Reviews": [{"Content": "I had to check out early and they refused to refund my 2 weeks cash prepaid I paid one month in advance in cash. I stayed one week and had to check out early. I gave notice but they refused to refund my 3 weeks cash prepaid. The reason they told me is they do not give refunds once the money has been paid. Intown Suites is a small family owned business that will steal from you. I would strongly advise taking your business elsewhere. In my 50 years on this planet, I have never come across a business that has refused to refund your money and apparently does not care about what you think based on the other similiar posts that I have read. These guys are nothing but thieves and hide behind the desk clerks to do the dirty work. You can bet I will see them in court.", "Date": "Aug 23, 2003", "ReviewID": "UR215069078", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g55711-d260923-r1258126-InTown_Suites_North_Dallas-Dallas_Texas.html", "HotelID": "260923", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
