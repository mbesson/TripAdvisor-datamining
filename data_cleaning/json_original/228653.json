Our third floor room was comfortable and quiet - our only complaint that the air conditioning was not turned on in the hotel because it was the beginning of April. However the staff kindly provided us with an electric fan which went some way to making the nights less stuffy. The buffet breakfast had a wide variety of food and was always a pleasurable way to start off our day. Sadly the unexpected rain during our stay didn't allow us to use the rooftop pool and terrace but had there been a little more sunshine, it would have been the perfect place to relax after a day exploring the city.

It's a good location, good staff and has nice, stylish rooms. I will certainly opt for it again next time. However, it seemed to be expensive this time, for over \u20ac150/night there are certainly comparable options. What really grates though is the 'Express' breakfast this price included. Walking into the restaurant, a nice buffet breakfast is laid out in the centre. However, the 'Express' breakfast provided is to one side and consists of a few small muffin type things, sliced bread for toast and jam etc. but that's it!!! Come on guys, if you're going to offer a rate that includes breakfast, then make it worthwhile for anyone who takes it. The 'Express' option really doesn't count at all, and certainly doesn't justify the extra cost. The meagre offer to the side was pretty disappointing and had I know that, I would not have paid the extra and gone for breakfast at one of the many Cafes nearby. Also the price included WiFi, which is good, but should be included in all hotels in this day and age. So again, slightly miffed at having to pay a higher room rate for its inclusion. In short, a great hotel, but go for the best rate and get free WiFi and a much better breakfast nearby.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Norwich, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGreat location for exploring Barcelona\u201d", "Author": "Tong998", "ReviewID": "UR126224539", "Content": "My wife and I stayed here 10-14th March for a citybreak booked through easyjet holidays.

At this time, all hotel rates are sky high. I booked 2 months in advance and was able to get a rate of approx Euro 230 including tax, wifi and express B/fast (basically toast/muffins/juice/tea coffee). And the cancellation policy was also good. At the time of the MWC, the hotels typically want the money upfront and do not refund. But this was good. You can pass by the hotel and miss it. They should have a bigger and brighter sign. Lobby was decent, with a sprinkling of sofas. They have a bar at one end. Check in was smooth and the people sounded friendly. The room was very good. Modern decor, comfortable bed, a nice relaxing chair, desk etc. It also had a Flat panel TV and an ipod dock. They also have a music system and DVD player, and you cna borrow dvds from the reception. The bathroom was very good. Very bright, clean. Had all the required toiletries. Had a bath tub with a JACUZZI. Yes that's right. Put in the bath salts kept there, light the candles and enjoy a nice spa, right in your room. Water was hot and pressure was good. The only thing missing was an ironing board, and they do not provide one even on request. Real let down. Housekeeping was done on time and room was made up very well. Room faces the street and had lots of sun coming in. So if you want to soak in the sun, ask for a room facing the street.

We started many evenings with a drink on the roof terrace, the time of year however, meant the pool was a tad chilly but could be lovely during summer. The room was nicely decorated, modern and clean with a lovely bathroom, perfect. The one downside, our room was at the front of the hotel on a relatively busy road with numerous cars/trucks/noisy deliveries made in the early hours which often woke us up.

Below is my experience in the hotel, categorised into 'room', 'hotel', 'bar' and 'service'. Room: Great size with a good bathroom, it had everything we needed including a safe and a minibar. The pillows on the bed were fantastic and the front desk bought us up a couple more when we requested them. The air con was very hit and miss, either absolutely freezing or quite warm which was a shame. Hotel: Hotel itself was nice. Good central location, only 3 blocks over from the main shopping street where the tourist buses drop off and pick up. There is some construction work right outside but this didn't really impact us as we left at 9am and didn't get back to the hotel till around 4pm (siesta time). We would hang out on top of the hotel at the pool and not hear anything. The pool was fantastic, really great area. Needs to be a bit more lounge space rather than bar/sitting space in the day. Food (burger & chips) was okay but not brilliant, orange juice was the same as a glass of wine which I thought was expensive. Bar: This hotel lets out the rooftop bar for private parties. Therefore although we used the bar in the day, we couldn't appreciate it at night as it was booked out from 8pm - midnight on both nights. The problem with the hotel is that it is full of open space and sound REALLY travels. We could hear the lifts all night, the music from the bar and people opening/closing doors quite audibly. Service: The front desk was brilliant and helped us out with taxis, sending postcards etc. Using a bit of Spanish was really appreciated (or seemed to be!) and they made us feel really welcome. The woman running the bar at the top of the hotel was fantastic, really friendly. I'd go here if you want somewhere cheap-ish and cheerful but I would say it's more 4* style, 3* substance.

Our room was tiny and an odd shape, probably ok for one person but far too small for two, storage for clothes/luggage was terrible, the complimentary bathrobes and slippers were nowhere to be seen, the bathroom was damp and covered in mould, paint was peeling from the ceiling, the windows leaked when it rained, the air conditioning didn't work - and apparently this was the receptionist's favourite room in the hotel!

We had pre booked a taxi to our hotel but because of our later arrival we had to get a taxi at the airport.

The hotel America was ideally situated for all the major attractions & tourist bus routes. There is currently on going road/underground rail work going on outside the hotel which on the plus side makes the road quiet during the evening as traffic is unable to use this route past the hotel. Engineering work starts at about 8am but really should'nt bother you at all because you will be keen to get out & about this wonderful city. The reception staff at the hotel are very helpful & will guide you through the map so that you can make the most of your stay & see all the sites. The bedrooms are of a good size & comfortable with a mini-bar & safe in them. Tv channels not so good but hey! what are you doing still in your room! The Breakfast room is nice with glass walls & good air conditioning. The staff again are attentive & helpful. Breakfast is ok & adequate but nothing spectacular. On the roof of the hotel is a small unheated swimming pool & terrace which was great mid-afternoon for a quick dip in the hot afternoon sun to recharge for more sight seeing. There is a nice lounge area on the roof with a bar where you can enjoy a lazy drink whilst looking out across the rooftops of the city. To sum up...ideally situated, great for a short break & would recommend you stay.

In fact, the hotel as such is quite nice. I stayed in a superium room which was spacious, tastefully decorated and well equipped. (Sure, the view from the large windows would have been better without the construction site, but at least there were no works going on during the weekend when I stayed there.)

When I arrived at Hotel America, I was shocked at the scale of construction work taking place literally outside the front door - the taxi couldn't even get near the hotel because of it! I'm surprised the hotel is allowed to open its doors to customers. Apparently they are building a major new fast-train station right outside so you can imagine the amount of work involved. I could barely hear the receptionist on check-in due to the level of noise. And there was no way you'd be able to relax by the pool. The hotel itself feels more like a hostel. It is definitely not a 4 star. I'd say 2 star at best. You can hear everything going on in the corridor and rooms around you. My room seemed to join onto the council flats next door and I was hearing all sorts of strange noises throughout the night from someone who seemed to be having toilet troubles next door. As a single female, I didn't feel particularly safe in the hotel, mainly due to the fact that my room looked onto a very large run-down estate. The room itself was very basic, dark and not the cleanest room I've ever stayed in. The staff seemed amicable enough during my one night stay - I cancelled the rest of my stay and moved to the Princess Barcelona - a business hotel which was 100% better value for money at the beach-end of Diagonal. On a plus point, the hotel is very central, but at the expense of any kind of luxuries.

Location was perfect -just off the busy tourist roads lined with lots of cafe bars but still close enough to be in walking distance of the main areas (approx 10 mins walk to the main square 'Placa de Catalunya' which is where the Ramblas starts from). Unfortunately, at the time of staying (11 Sept-14 Sept) the small square immediately in front of the hotel was a building site. We had no noise problems in our room at all but the beautiful roof garden and pool was very noisy in the daytime which ruined the whole idea of choosing this hotel. (If not swimming, an ipod may be a solution ?!! and at night it's simply a wonderful rooftop). The staff were extremely helpful and happy and the hotel is spotless - it felt 4 star. Very minor niggles included a smell of smoke in the room at certain times and a noisy air con when used on medium or full speed but it was effective on the lowest quiet speed so not an issue. You can be sure that if you highlight any niggles, they will be sorted promptly by this hotel. There is a basic small gym and sauna. Room prices are competitive. We didn't use the restaurant. Overall an excellent, reasonably priced hotel which I would be happy to return to once the building work is completed. A few city points... 'Our' cafe bar lined road next to the hotel looked to be more of a local's haunt which is always a good sign and the \"WOW\" cafe bar proved this right as it served good food, healthy proportions and reasonably priced. The typical cafe bar / restaurant food prices in Barcelona are not too bad. We love tapas and was spending typically \u00a37-\u00a310 each on food per meal. It's when you start adding a glass (not a pint) of beer at \u00a33.50 - \u00a34.50 each to the bill that things start adding up in Barcelona. There's a great choice of food, whether meaty or veggie. We felt the pick pocket issue was blown all out of proportion - just keep your bag close and closed. Get the open top bus tour from outside the Sagrada Familia (sorry spelling) - hefty queue but worth it. Red, green and blue routes take you all round the city. Use the map to get off and on at any of the stops, switching from one route to another if preferred at the stops marked with all 3 route colours - and knowing that you only wait 5 mins for another bus to pick you up at any of the stops - fantastic service. Airport Aerobus (blue bus) takes you very cheaply (3.5 euros) from Barcelona airport (every 12 mins in the day) to the city - it's last stop is Placa Catalunya (main square). Suggest you get your hotel address and plan a route from the square to the hotel before hand. Get a return bus ticket and pick up the return Aerobus at the main square again (where the 2 fountains are in the square). Becareful A2 bus is for Terminal 2 and A1 bus for Terminal 1. Ryan air cabin baggage max size catches lots of travellers out (\u00a340 fine!!). Never saw them weigh any (10kg max) but your bag size will be checked (max is 55cm x 40cm x 20cm - 1 piece each) - floppy ruck sack style is best.

Those are the positive things about the hotel. I had several issues with the hotel in general though. Its calling itself a 4* hotel & yet 2 of the rooms on each floor have no windows or natural light at all. Do not stay in rooms 9 or 10 on any of the floors, they have no windows at all, I stayed in room 10 on my first night & it was like being in a cell of some sort - horrible. Fortunately I managed a room change the next day.There is a terrible smell in the bathrooms of those rooms in particular & in the bathrooms in general. I do not know if its the chemicals they are using to clean the bathrooms with or the fact you can't ventilate any of them but I have never encountered such a smell anywhere & it was extremely unpleasant to say the least. I switched the air-con off altogether & that seemed to improve the smell in the bedroom area of the room so while the room wasn't cool I could at least breathe in it. There is a major construction project going on just outside the hotel, the upside of that is that there is no through traffic. The down side is that work starts at 8 am & apart from seista time doesn't finish until 8pm. You can hear the noise everywhere including on the roof. Would I stay at this hotel again? No. Would I stay in that neighbourhood in a different hotel - definitely.

My friend and I thought the hotel was very, very nice and contemporary and although there were roadworks going on outside the triple glazing took care of that. Upon arrival the hotel staff were absolutely lovely and told us the best places to visit and do shopping. The downside was when it came to the ironing. We needed an iron and were told that they did not provide them but could iron our clothes for us; there was no mention of cost at this time. The next morning we asked for 3 tops each and two pairs of jeans to be ironed, we handed the clothes over, still no mention of cost! We went out for the entire day and when we returned we saw our ironing waiting for us together with a bill for 57 euros. We were absolutely horrified by this and complained to the night shift manager. Two tops that did not cover your bottom were charged as dresses (8 euros each) and my cardigan was charged as a sweater and they also tried to charge for another non existent sweater. We complained about this, but both the night shift manager , Olaska and Javier on the next morning were extremely unhelpful and rude and did not want to assist us. Olaska even left a couple waiting to speak with her to leave the hotel without having their query dealt with; she could have asked us to step aside for one moment! It just goes to show how bad their customer services skills are, they were argumentative and unprofessional. They corrected the tops to dresses and the cardigan from a sweater to a top, but the fact they did not inform us of costs and failed to have the price list in our room upon arrival as they should have for our perusal, shows their inability to have even come to a compromise, which they flatly refused!

Few decent shops in the area but again a short stoll or metro ride brings you plenty. Bit run down on some of the side streets.

The area is still an excellent area to stay in for easy access to the main areas and has good local restaurants etc. The following morning at 9am the silence was broken by a concrete breaker attached to a JCB breaking through the raod surface which continued for most of the Friday however thankfully they did not work on the weekend.

The location was fantastic, a couple of blocks from Passing de Gracia and about 15 minute stroll from Catalunya Square and within easy reach of all the tourist buses and the metro stations. The hotel is laid back and quite a chic crowd but not pretentious; really welcoming. The roof terrace was lovely and the pool and hot tub were a welcome relief after a day of sightseeing; the bar serves great cocktails and a variety of beers and had free tapas when we stayed which was good as the prices were slightly expensive. Having said that, Barcelona is a VERY expensive city so the bar bill was in line with the rest of the city. Rooms were great, incredibly clean and quite spacious for a city hotel, having stayed in Barcelona the previous year and paid considerably more for a hotel on the Passing de Gracia, this hotel is great value for money. The continental breakfast is good and the staff attentive. The hotel has a car that is available for residents free of charge for 4 hours per room per stay, great news if you are used to the drivers in Barcelona! Their highway code is very different here and personally I would not risk driving, especially as the public transport is so easily accessible and the city is great for walking around. A taxi for 4 adults from the airport was only 25EUROS and took about 15 - 20 minutes. The restaurant next to the hotel was lovely( walk out of the hotel, turn right, walk 5 meters and you are there) - really small, mainly locals in there , the tapas and food was great as well as the staff! I would defiantly recommend this restaurant. If staying in Barcelona, find the restaurant Divinus on Ronda Universidad a short walk from Catalunya Sq. which has a really varied menu, lovely food, great value. Also, we went to the Campari Milano cocktail bar on the same road which was also fantastic, great atmosphere and a proper 'old skool' style cocktail bar with really knowledgeable staff.

There were cereals, fresh fruit, fresh juices, yoghurts, bacon, sausages(mini), cheeses, meats, cakes and even chocolate. But the best thing about this hotel is the staff. From the moment we walked in everyone who worked there was so friendly to us. Nothing was too much trouble. When we asked about getting tickets for the Champions League match they advised us on where to go but said they could try and get them for us if we had no luck. One day we had a bottle of cava and asked for an ice bucket and some glasses. The gentleman we spoke to told us someone would bring it up right away. Moments later, someone brought up a tray with not only the ice bucket and glasses but also roses (which were gorgeous!) and a plate of large delicious strawberries! It was such a lovely touch! At check out we just mentioned in our conversation with another gentleman that the stay had been a present for my partner's birthday. He then proceeded to open a bottle of cava and gave us a glass each. Again this was such a lovely thing to do. The cleaning staff, bar and restaurant staff and reception/management (especially Christian , Xavi and Slauka) were all fantastic and friendly and are a credit to the hotel. They made our stay unforgettable and I hope they are all there when we hope to return in September.", "Date": "April 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swansea", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Hotel America\u201d", "Author": "robhops", "ReviewID": "UR59251327", "Content": "Just returned from a 4 night stay in the Hotel America. We had a fantastic time there. We booked 2 rooms as we travelled with my mother in law. Both rooms were ample in size. In our room, they had put a roll away bed in for our 3 year old son free of charge (I did request this prior to arrival). The rooms had all the usual benefits of a 4* hotel i.e. comfy beds, mini bar, safe, free toiletries, plasma tv. Our one minor complaint was that the rooms were very warm and the fan cooler didn't work. However, we didn't complain as it wasn't unbearable and I'm sure it would have been fixed straight away if we had reported it. The service of the staff was exceptional including reception, bar staff, restaurant staff and cleaners. Nothing was too much trouble. The buffet breakfast as detailed in previous reviews was great. It was one of the best we've had. Plenty of hot and cold choices. We were even given a glass of champagne for my wife's 30th birthday. The bar was nice although quite expensive. It was lovely to unwind at the end of a busy day with a beer or glass of wine. The bar area also had a computer with free internet access which was a nice bonus. Another real attraction of the hotel was the terrace. Although the pool was too cold, the jacuzzi was warm which our 3 yr old son enjoyed. The terrace also has lovely views across the city. The location of the hotel was ideal close to Rambla Catalunya and Paseig de Gracia. It was only 3 blocks from the Diagonal metro. It was a busy area but not too busy. There is a lovely restaurant/tapas bar next door to the hotel called Restaurante Mediteraneo. We had lovely tapas there which was always busy mainly with Spanish locals.

A problem I had, which hopefully is not a chronic problem for the hotel, is that a small but noticeable amount of sewer gas was seeping in through the drains in the bathroom. The management was aware of it and was working on how to resolve it.

The hotel was very clean, looked \"trendy\" enough for a teenage daughter, staff were very helpful and just friendly enough, the free internet was a boon and the rooftop area was lovely (although February wasn't the time to get the best from it). The situation of the hotel was great for sightseeing and we always felt safe in that area. Could walk to Ramblas etc, was cheap to get a taxi to and from Nou Camp (which is a great visit, even if you're not a fan). The pickpockets were out in force in the old town but they didn't approach us, i think because we made sure we had a tight grip of our bags (which were slung across our bodies) - much easier pickings elsewhere i suspect. You could see the same suspects moving from one tourist area to another - loitering and watching for unattended bags outside cafe's etc. Would recommend the bar/cafe across the street for a cheap meal - we ate late, like the locals, and the atmosphere was far better than in the more expensive restaurants...and watched Barca win on the TV! You could hear noise from the street from our room but it was just folk going about their business, more a bustle of activity than intimidating and troublesome like it might be in the UK.

Although there was a good choice of cold meats, cereals etc. I decided to have a piece of toast and some coffee. I was asked what I would like to drink and I said coffee.

At 11.05a.m. we asked for more coffee as the food was being taken away but we were told there was no more coffee. It took a trip to reception to persuade the waiter to give us more.

The bathroom was a good size and it made a change to have one with outside light. We had requested a quiet non smoking room, which we got - the room was at the back of the building so no street noise. To be honest the only noise we heard (having read some of the other reviews) was that of other guests slamming doors/talking loudly -although didn't hear them at night/early morning and not really a problem and no different from any other hotel. We found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. In the bar area you can get free access to the internet and there is a selection of guide/art books you can browse through. The hotel also stocks a selection of magazines which you can borrow. We did not eat breakfast at the hotel as we felt at E14.75 it was a bit steep (unless you can eat a big breakfast). Instead we went to one of the many cafes in the area. The hotel is in a good area and about 5 mins walk to the Passeig de Gracia and 15 mins walk to Placa Catalunya. There are loads of restaurants and bars near the hotel so it is very easy to stay local after a day of shopping/sightseeing etc. Whilst we did not use it (being Jan) the hotel has a great roof terrace/pool and looked a great chill out place, especially on a summers evening with a glass of cava catching the late sun! The hotel has a very small gym and sauna in the basement. We did use the sauna, which was fine.

It is an excellent location to base a stay to explore the most interesting parts of the city. We were able to walk all over the Las Ramblas neighborhoods and the Gothic district. We even walked to the Sacred Familia Cathedral in no more than 15 minutes one morning. The breakfast is more than adequate although they do run out of things if you wait too long to go to breakfast. The negatives for us were that the street noise is pretty loud in the room. We were on the 5th floor and it was difficult to sleep. This is complicated by the fact that the air conditioning is not on while they are in heating mode and they keep the hotel halls very warm at least on our floor. This meant in order to sleep we had to open the windows to cool the room, which meant that the noise became much worse. Our methodology evolved to where we opened the windows in the evening to get the room cold and then closed them to go to bed. The other problem was that the beds didn't have a top sheet but a very nice down comforter. This means that you are either under the comforter or exposed, this is hard for me to regulate my sleeping comfort temperature.

Very selfishly I have not before posted as the really great hotels I have stayed in have remained my secret and I have not had a really bad experience warranting a bad review. This one was, however, an absolute howler and I feel compelled to give my fellow travellers a 'heads up'. Having booked two standard rooms for one Saturday night we arrived in Barcelona and turned up at the hotel at 11.30. The rooms were not ready (they were not meant to be). No problem, we thought we\u00b4d go for a walk and a spot of lunch. When we returned we were given our room keys. I had made a very strong and explicit request for no smoking rooms. Both of our parties were non smoking and the smell of smoke triggers my asthma. As soon as the door to our room opened a haze of smoke emerged. It was as if the previous occupant had left only 10 minutes before and had left a cigarette burning in an ashtray. We returned to reception to be met by a frosty and frankly ambivolent attitude. We were given two wholly unacceptable options, keep the room and lump it or move to a single room (they call it a double for single occupancy, but the description bends any common sense view of those words. Having viewed the aforesaid broom cupboard we returned to reception and expressed our displeasure. We were told the hotel was full and so there was nothing that could be done. If we were not happy we should leave. Had we not been with friends who were already mid afternoon siesta that is exactly what we would have done. We had no option but to take the small room. To explain how small this room is you should picture struggling to get two small bags in, having to pass the end of the bed sideways and having to put the bags on the bed to open the cupboard. Its only saving grave was a modestly sized and quite well appointed bathroom. The room in question is the same on each floor of the hotel and always ends in the number 10; so we stayed in room 110. The room is wedged in an inner corner of the hotel and has no natural light. Also, because the room is so small our heads were about 1 metre from the marble floored corridor and about a foot from the maids cupboard. This resulted in one of the noisiest stays in a hotel room I have had the misfortune of suffering. I am a very heavy sleeper and I found it intollerable. I have stayed in many hotels in Barcelona some luxurious, some budget and this is without question, by a country mile, the worst stay I have had. In fact, it may be the worst stay I have had worldwide. The hotel as a whole is small, modern and trendy and I can see why many people recommend it. My experience was, however, disastrous.

The window would not close properly and the traffic outside can be quite noisy at times. We got a new room on the 6. floor and were happy about that. The problem was the paperthin walls, the banging doors and the marble floor in the hallway...which we more than got our share of with a group of loud, noisy and drunk people next door.

A gym is available, but it merely consists of a small weights machine, a bicycle and a \"running\" machine. Service is pretty indifferent. The hotel lobby is extremely small and really unsuitable to wind down after a day spent strolling through the magnificent city that is Barcelona. In all, this was probably a 2 or 3 star that was refurbished in a \"modern\" fashion to look more costly, but deep down can't really hide its roots.

Took a taxi both ways from the airport cost Euro 25 each way, but make sure you put your seat belt on because no driver in Barcelona takes any prisoners.

The hotel was chosen via the internet after reading mostly excellent reports. Although not the cheapest hotel, Barcelona is relatively expensive and as of many major cities in the world, accomodation standards vary widely. Unless you are comparing this hotel to hotels such as the Ritz etc. it would be harsh to give a bad review. What you have at \"around\" \u00a3100/night is a modern, bright, funcky hotel with excellent rooms...bright spacious with modern furniture, air/con, digital safe, mini bar, t.v, sofa, excellent shower etc., my only one moan was no tea or coffee making facilities, but then there is 24 hour room service, prices being very reasonable. The features I liked best were the roof top swimming pool and jacuzzi...again the weather needs to be hot to take advantage, when we went it was drizzling and cloudy believe it or not, this being July!...oh well. The small bar seemed to lack atmosphere, the staff are very attentive and friendly. the other excellent feature was the breakfast dinning room. Breakfast cost us 13 Euro each per day, while not being as cheap as a coffee and croissant if eating out what you do get is a fabulous buffett stlye breakfast with tea/coffee and \"full english fry up\" served in a impecabbly clean and stylish dinning room...well worth it, p.s , what a \"quality\" fruit selection !. Early morning room calls and check out are brilliant...nothing is too much trouble...taxi waiting at the door. How anyone could complain about this hotel is beyond me. The location is top quality too, far removed from the run down areas near La Ramblas but a nearby sub way links all areas with a 5 minute stroll at \"Diagonal\" to make it an excellent base. Many people rave about Barcelona, I must be the exception to the rule. I found the city too large to enjoy. The shops are no different than many major towns in many countries, of course you do have the real top class shopping and would be great if you like that sort of thing and have the money to take advantage of them, not \"my cup of tea\". The port area was quite when we visited, not that impressed with the harbour area lined with typical english tourist tat cafes..give them a miss. I found the Barri Gothic quarter the best and El Raval a close second, brilliant small shops and cafes. As for La Ramblas...what a dump. There is an unease as you walk about, always expecting to get robbed, pickpocketed or bag snatched, this is a disgrace on the local police for not doing more to stamp out a REAL AND PROLIFIC PROBLEM especially given the city depends on the tourist trade. \"Some\" taxi drivers will also \"take advantage\" ( or is the term theft ! ) of people being ignorant to the tariff system and will try and add on \"baggage charges\" etc when calculating the fare, count the change also BEFORE getting out of the cab , pre-booking via the hotel is a better bet. There is a seedy area near Paral-lel sub station ...take care, many prostitutes and north african people hang out on the streets and thats in the day time, heaven only knows what it is like at night. Ironically a lunch \"set menu\" at a restaurant on Carrer De Sant Pau was one of the best I have ever had, be prepared to wait for a table despite it's quite location.
