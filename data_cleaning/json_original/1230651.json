I wasn't disappointed with the location, it's very easy to get around from here, there are buses all around and it's literally a 2 minute walk to the Darling Harbour precint. However, for me that's where the positives stop really. When I arrived, the guy behind reception was very welcoming and polite, I cannot fault him for that. However what I can fault is how he told me I was \"lucky\" that they had rooms available when he could not find my internet booking. I had a booking confirmation therefore I get a room. Whether your computer system is \"synced\" correctly or not is not of my concern and I don't really think it was an appropriate way to address the issue. He also repeatedly kept asking if it was \"just\" me for the room. It felt very pointed, and when I got to the room I realised why for there is no possible way that there is a smaller room in that hotel to the one that I was given. I did know going in that the rooms were compact but for someone that is staying more than one night I couldn't understand why you would put them in the smallest room? I have seen pics on their website and not all rooms are that small. There was barely room to put a suitcase down and manouver around with any ease or comfort. I found the actual room to be quite grubby. For some reason there was always dust on the floor in quite big clumps and I hate this new lazy thing hotels seem to be doing of just putting a sheet over a doona with no cover, it feels very unhygienic to me. When the room above me used their bathroom, a very high buzzing noise would echo throughout my room at any time of the day or night, at first I thought I was going crazy!! Also my room was right outside a door that was marked 'staff only', which apparently must have been some kind of garbage room as at 7am one morning someone was outside there rustling and crinkling plastic bags to within an inch of their life. Small issues yes, but as a collection they all contributed towards bad nights sleep in this hotel. Be warned, they do not have room service - if you order any food or drink you have to go down and pick it up yourself!! And if you want to store your luggage after check out they will charge you $7 for the privledge, either that or leave it for free in an unsecured corridor....The whole place just gives the impression that customer service is not their first priority.

We asked for hand towels and were told that they did not have them, and would send up a wash cloth and a bath towel. What arrived was a wash cloth and a bath mat. We booked this hotel because it was close to Barangaroo Wharf 5 Passenger Terminal for cruise ships (about a 10 minute walk to the terminal, but we used a cab which was out in front of the hotel-$10). For one night the room was OK, but for an extended stay the room would not be acceptable. The hotel is next to the Western Distributor Highway-about half the rooms face this highway.

Hotel amenities / Staff - The hotel is perfect, though the room size can be slightly small. The staff are very attentive to your needs. Facilities wise they are great. Negatives - Only one - The only problem with the hotel is the fact that a whole day's internet costs AUD25 which doesn't make any sense.

The hotel is basic - don't expect luxuries like designer soaps or a pillow menu in this one. But you will find a reasonably comfortable bed, and very clean, modern interior. A significant benefit to this Ibis hotel compared with any others in the chain that I've stayed at, is that the hotel has been designed with a higher quality fit-out - the bathroom, in particular, is of a high quality standard, with proper ceramic basic, quiet, clean showers, and a toilet with a nice soft-closing lid. The TV system is first-rate, out-doing many of the dated systems you'll find in older 5 star hotels - the system includes all the expected movies, messages, and channels, but in a great HD interface that's responsive and well tuned. The rooms include a work desk with adequate space and connectivity. The food options are basic, but again they're adequate - some simple heated food is available for collection from reception 24 hours, and the cafe is open for breakfast, and offers a good value take-away option - where you can make yourself an espresso coffee and take a tray of food (yoghurt, toast, fruit etc). The parking is limited but has always been available when I've stayed here. The floors in the rooms are an easy-to-clean wood-finish laminate, and the bed is actually a mattress elevated from the floor on a floating wooden base - fairly unique for a hotel, but allows for easy cleaning - and I can't fault the cleanliness of the rooms.

The fact that we went back to this hotel speaks volumes about how good it is. Despite all the wonderful things I am about to say, I will make one disclaimer: this hotel is located next to a highway. On our first stay we got room 514, which faces the highway. The room has a double-paned window, which severely reduced the noise coming from the road, but the truth is that we could still hear the occasional heavy truck and motorcycle. That being said, as heavy sleepers we still had two good nights of sleep and were impressed enough that we booked a room for our subsequent visit to Sydney. For our second stay, we got room 305 which was away from the highway and this just made our experience even more brilliant. In this room we did not hear any noise from outside. If you are a light sleeper, you should insist on a room away from the highway. That being clarified, this hotel is fantastic on all levels: The staff was kind, efficient and clearly had a commitment to excellence. The room was comfortable, clean, well appointed, well lit, comfy queen bed, desk, small sofa, nice bathroom with ample shelf space and good water pressure\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and had awesome \u00e2\u20ac\u0153black-out\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd blinds that made the room completely black at night. However, you have to pay for internet access. The room service menu is very good and affordable; however the breakfast was a little expensive (there are plenty of affordable caf\u00c3\u00a9s in the area). The location is fantastic. Steps from Darling harbour with its caf\u00c3\u00a9s, restaurant and shops. You are a 10 minute walk to The Rocks, there is a ferry stop (that goes to/from Circular Quay) steps from the hotel and the train that goes to the airport is only 3 blocks away. The rooms aren't huge but aren't tiny either, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s got a bit of a business hotel feel lacking a little warmth, and if they offered better towels and free wi-fi that would put them over the top. Overall, the quality of this hotel, its magnificent location and its reasonable price trumps the small items I mentioned and I would definitely stay there again.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Canberra, Australia", "Title": "\u201cFriendly staff and a well priced basic room.\u201d", "Author": "Aaron_from_Canberra", "ReviewID": "UR113770401", "Content": "The front desk staff were friendly, professional and very helpful when called upon.

If you want fancy, you pay for fancy. I booked my brother and his children into the Ibis for three nights and joined them for one of them. My wife and I were upgraded to a King harbour view because we are Advantage Plus members but it was still basically a slightly more fancy Ibis room.

We got one of the best locations in Sydney for under $150 for the night. Up the road at the Hilton I would have paid $350 and it's nowhere near as good a base for a holiday as the Ibis.

One \"surprise\" was that instead of carpet the floor in the room had a wood grain style vinyl. The bed was comfortable, and the double blinds very effective at keeping the room dark in the morning. I note other contributors have commented on the breakfast. I thought $20 was reasonable for the hot breakfast, which included baked beans, bacon, scrambled egg, breakfast sausages, hash browns and mushrooms, but $15 for the continental breakfast selections is a bit steep. As other contributors have noted the hotel is a short walk to Darling Harbour, Wynyard and Circular Quay. I noted the hotel were advertising airport transfers for $12 and hire lockers for $7 per day, although I didn't use either facilitiy.

Originally booked a superior room but on check in was upgraded to a king harbour room. These rooms are bigger than the standard rooms & have a partial view of the water so the space was adequate for our needs (2 adults & a 3yr old) even with a rollaway in the room. King size zip bed (breaks into a twin) was fine but the problem always with these zip beds is the zip in the middle being not very comfortable should you roll onto it -this is a fairly common thing in hotels though and I just wish hotels would invest in some matress toppers which would alleviate this issue. Being a newer hotel everything is still fairly fresh, bathroom does the job, shower cubicle is small but water pressure & heat are good. Air con worked really well and was adjustable in room. The hotel is in a good location to easily walk to all the restaurants of King St Wharf and probably a 5-10 minute stroll along the water to cockle bay wharf/darling harbour main area and monorail station, so this gives you pretty easy access to the city.

We arrived at around 12-ish and were managed to checked into our room right away as the staff told us that it was cleaned and ready for us. I was impressed in their flexibility on that as many other hotels I've stayed at always made us wait till the check-in time. We had a standard room and I've read the review before making the booking so we were prepared for the size of our room. However when we walked into our room, we were so happy with the cleanliness that we have forgotten about the size of the room. It sort of made up for it as our first priority in hotels is cleanliness plus no rust can be found in the bathroom. The room is very modern and clean so we didn't mind about the small size at all. It's really not as small as what I've expected. Besides, we spent most of our time traveling outdoor anyway. We just need a very clean room to go home to at the end of the day to sleep and rest. The air-condition was having a malfunction one night and we couldn't sleep at all as it was very hot in Sydney at the time and staying at 7th Floor made it worst coz the heat raised from bottom to top. We went to the front desk to complain about it at 2am after trying very hard to sleep but failed and I was having headache at that time. A staff named Vanessa was wonderful as she tried her very best to look for a room with cooler temperature for us and in the end, we were moved to a superior room at 1st Floor for the rest of our trip (2 nights left). We were very very impressed with IBIS King Street Wharf by that time for being treated fairly and with great ethic. Were given a complimentary 'continental breakfast' which was so-so but it's free so there's nothing to complain about. I won't pay for a breakfast here however as they are with very few selection and does not look appealing. I've been to many hotels and tried many buffet breakfasts so I know the difference when I see one. However, that is a very minor problem as I'm sure the Hotel will do something to improve that as they are still a very new Hotel.

The hotel is well located in the city. It is next to Darling Harbour and two or three blocks away from Wynyard train station. For gamblers it is 15mins walk to the Star City Casino! Tip: If you are exploring Sydney for a few days get the RED PASS ticket from any train station. It lets you travel for 7 days on the public ferry, buses and trains for AUD38. The ferry is just a block away from the hotel which takes you past the Opera House and under the Sydney Harbour Bridge.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Adelaide", "Title": "\u201cI will be coming back\u201d", "Author": "agisthos", "ReviewID": "UR28045706", "Content": "A new Hotel is always an interesting experience.

I took my 5yo daughter and it was fine for the two of us, but we only had one suitcase (there was room under the bed for more I guess) The decor was lovely, as was the bathroom and there was nothing missing AND everything was shiny and new!! We had room 611 and this faced the freeway and into some other buildings which was kind of pretty at night - I was impressed at how well the double glazing on the small window worked. One of the \"Sydney\" websites suggests there is a restaurant - it is only for breakfast but the small bar is open late and I believe it has 'snacks'. There is a convenience store across the road, and only a short walk to all the cafes/restaurants of Darling Harbour. We utilised the King Street Wharf ferry, but you can get there via Wynyard Train Station. I wouldnt try lugging luggage back up to Wynyard though (weekend access limited) We took the ferry around to Circular Quay, then caught the train from there back to the airport. I booked direct on the Ibis website, as there wasnt much difference between that and the usual last minute booking sites.

The hotel is only a few minutes walk from Darling Harbor and about 20 minutes from the Opera House.

Our room was clean and comfortable. We had a rollaway bed in our room which was nice and not at all as bad as one might fear. Overall, we were very pleased with the room. The breakfast is from 6 to 10 and has a lot to offer. It is worth adding if you choose one of the room bookings with breakfast. The staff are a real benefit of staying here as well. They are friendly and courteous and helpful. They knew our names when they saw us in the morning and could give advice regarding sites to see. In all, a very good experience. I would not hesitate to stay here again or to recommend it. One word of advice if you are coming from the airport. If you take the train, get off at the Wynyard station and walk to the hotel (about 10 minutes depending on which door you exit). However, this is a really bad way to get to the hotel. Save money, time and walking by taking one of the shuttles from the airport to the hotel for less than the cost of the train.", "Date": "March 13, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane, Australia", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel, great location...but the rooms are tiny\u201d", "Author": "Opanook", "ReviewID": "UR24932353", "Content": "We just arrived back from a weekend in Sydney with friends. Three couples all staying at the Ibis Hotel King Street Wharf. The hotel is in a good location - a few blocks walk from Wynyard Railway Station and a block from King Street Wharf/Darling Harbour. Checking in to the hotel was no problem with the staff friendly and welcoming. Our friends were already checked in and after mentioning this to the receptionist, she changed us to the same floor. Nothing seemed to be a problem. We phoned later to get a bottle opener and it was delivered very quickly with no fuss. Would have been nice to have one in the room though. When we entered our room, we were a little surprised to see how tiny it was. Just enough space for the bed, mini fridge, small table & chair and bathroom. My 5ft 11 boyfriend slept with his feet hanging over the end of the bed. We had to shuffle around each other which was a little annoying. For a one night stay, that was ok, but a few days of this would have driven us nuts. The bathroom (shower & toilet) was also on the small side but ok for what you had to do in there. Was also surprising to see timber floors in the room - was fine, but something I hadn't seen before. The room was clean, tidy and the bed comfortable. The hotel is new, so everything is still looking and feeling lovely. It was quiet with double glass windows (also small) considering we had a major road going past our window. Checking out was fine and handled professionally but felt a little sorry for the receptionist as it was right on check-out time and the foyer was packed. He handled it well and everyone seemed ok. No cranky people or yelling. A good sign. We did hear from a few of the other guests in passing who had had issues with a mistake with the parking charge, elevators that couldn't find the basement levels and a room that smelt like cigarette smoke (a unconsiderate previous guest who didn't follow the rules obviously!...which is out of the control of the hotel). We thought the hotel was affordable, clean, tidy, in a good location with friendly staff and would definitely consider staying here again for a night. My only other recommendation would be to larger, taller people - you may need to consider somewhere else with more space.", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "York", "Title": "\u201cGreat location, watch for the parking charges\u201d", "Author": "Ambra60", "ReviewID": "UR24070917", "Content": "The hotel had only been open for 15 days.
