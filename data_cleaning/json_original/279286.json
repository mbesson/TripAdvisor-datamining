One could be picky and say the bar was a little spartan, and there was no restaurant, but these were minor faults - and anyway there were two more than acceptable restaurants just opposite. As other reviewers have said, the staff, from \"top to bottom\", just could not have been more friendly or helpful. The palazzo was well maintained, and the great hall on the piano nobile was very impressive. We had a junior suite - which was more like a large room than a suite, but it was perfectly adequate, with balconies over the San Lorenzo canal. For anyone who has read the \"Brunetti\" novels of Donna Leon, the Questura is two hundred metres to the right! I can't wait for my next trip to Venice....and I shall certainly try to stay at the Liassidi Palace.

Breakfast is served at tables with a water-level view of the canal (just like on the website). All of that was perfect, and we had a great room (#408); it's called a junior suite, but is actually just one massive room with wonderful canal views from several windows. We booked as members of the Small Luxury Hotels club and got a good rate this way. The children shared a smaller room across the hall, without views. So, what's wrong with it? It's hard to say, actually. Maybe I'm just a bit spoilt, but ... From Google Maps satellite view you see a small terrace with parasols. It's there, but it houses a fat air-conditioning unit, so only the determined smoker will ever put up with the noise to sit outside. Most of the fourth floor is one huge open space with bits of left-over furniture half concealed behind room dividers. You feel like you are walking through some abandoned conference facility on the way to the room. There doesn't seem to be a bar. Part of the breakfast room is fitted out as a bar, but it's not somewhere you can sit and relax during the day or evening, as far as I could see. Maybe it just isn't a very good conversion of a Venetian palazzo into a modern hotel. But we did have a great four days.

Breakfast was good by Italian standards and even included bacon and eggs. Although the Hotel boasts a bar, the only evening we tried it, it seemed to be closed. There are plenty of spaces to sit and relax outside of your room, including a pleasant courtyard - but in a place like Venice you'd be daft to spend much time in your Hotel. Get out, get wandering and savouring this unique and wonderful car free city. Excellent though the facilities are, location is perhaps the Hotel's best selling point - a ten minute walk along canals and past shops and restaurants will get you to St Marks Square, rather less to the Riva degli Schiavoni where you can walk along the waterfront or catch a vaporetto. Gondola rides costing an arm and a leg are available even closer - you can't go to Venice and not try one. Despite proximity to the busiest areas, the Hotel was quiet and peaceful and the streets around it free from crowds. It was however the first sunny weekend of the year - we can't vouch for the state of the crowds in high season! Even in April, St Marks Square was crowded at times. In conclusion, you'll have guessed that we had a great time - Venice is unique but very expensive.

I stayed with my wife for three nights at the end of March. we were greeted by friendly reception staff who showed us to our room (105) where there was an ice bucket with complemntary Belini waiting for us. The room was beautiful and was finished in polished walnut wood. It was spotlessly clean and the ensuite truly sparkled. Our window opened onto the canal where we could view passing gondolas or other canal traffic. There was even a gondolier sitting on the bridge opposite. Breakfast was included in the price and was mainly continental style but there was always scrambled eggs and bacon as well as the usual coissants, cheese and ham. Although as usual, it was self service the helpful attendants brought copious hot coffee or tea within seconds of asking. The hotel was only 5 minutes walk from St Marcs square and similar to the water bus terminus of San Zaccaria. We asked staff on a few occasions for help about which was the best boat to catch and they knew the departure times off by heart, and even told us of connection times for journeys further affield. Were there any down sides? Well, If I was really nit picky I would mention that there was only a shower and no bath in the en suite, however it was a fancy shower that had nozzles down the sides as well as the usual overhead shower. Also there was a small amount of noise fron the activity on the canal in the mornings, but If you want a canal view then that is the price to pay. Even so we were able to sleep till 9am, so it wasn't that bad. The final slight niggle was that the re was supposed to be a bar available till midnight but one evening when we asked for 2 glasses of wine at 10 past 10 we were told that the bar was closed. Having said that when we looked disappointedly at the receptionist he offered to bring us what we asked for to the public area. We had extra large servings with a small bowl of salty snacks and when I asked to pay he said they were on the house.

We had some trepidation with some of the comments on the hotel trying to push it's own taxi services, selling trips to Murano and so on. Ignore all you read about that - I think that people must have been staying at a different hotel or, the hotel management have tightened down on this practice. We were absolutely delighted. This was our silver wedding anniversary so i wanted to ensure everything went well. I had booked a water taxi from the airport ( fabulous and worth every penny ) directly to the hotel. I had also prebooked the motor service from the terminal to the boat but didn't need it, the walk is all covered and takes less than 5 minutes. I'm not sure the taxi driver knew exactly where the hotel was as we ended up reversing the wrong way down one of the canals for about 300m to the front door of the hotel ! It all added to the fun ! Once in the hotel we were taken directly to our junior suite on the 4th floor overlooking the canal. I'm not sure about the comment about the lack of a lift - there's certainly a great little lift complete with seat. It's very slow but works perfectly well. The room was stunning with loads of room, great artwork, lovely view, an enormous bed and very well equipped bathroom. The only disappointment was a fairly old TV and only one armchair when there was plenty of room for 2. The hotel is quiet, beautiful and very well apppointed. The courtyard is lovely to sit out in in the evening. There is a bar but I don't think it gets used often but the desk staff will always open up and get hot or cold drinks for you without any fuss. Breakfasts were fine with a good selection of cold food and breads / pastries but with the ubiquitous scrambled eggs and streaky bacon as the only hot choice. Great views from the windows if you are lucky / early enough to get a window seat and the girls who work at breakfast are great and can't do enough for you. Opposite the hotel there are two small restaurants - litterally just over a small bridge and less than 30 seconds from the hotel. The food is great in both and very reasonably priced with a tourist menu at under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac25 in each for three courses. It's about a 10 minute easy walk to the Piazza San Marco or only 5 minutes to the nearest vaparetto stop at San Zaccaria San Marco. From here you can get to all of the major sites with ease. We bought the 72 hours passes at \u00e2\u201a\u00ac33 each and certainly got our money's worth. Take the #41 to Murano for your day trip to the glass factories and glass museum. The hop back on the 41 and it will take you all the way around the other side of Vanice, down by the railway station and then out into Canale della Giudecca for great sunset views as you approach San Marco again. DONT'S ? don't get caught out eating lunch or dinner at the Grand Canal side at Rialto Bridge. Stupid prices, rude service and awful food. Also don't worry about the floods between October and April - they're well used to it and deal with it very efficiently. For even more fun, invest in a pair of wellington boots for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 and have fun watching the other tourists trying to balance along the raised walkways - especially as gthe Japanese tourists stop to take photos and create havoc !

The hotel is not quite as central as many reviewers here seem to think it is, but the fact of the matter is that you can walk from one end of the city to the other and back again in 45 min to an hour. I would strongly discourage anyone from following the hotels advice and taking the \"vaporetto\" (public transit boats) from the hotel unless walking is a serious problem for you. Walking from the hotel is very easy (given a good map and maybe a compass) and the vaproretto stop for the hotel is second to last, meaning an over-an-hour boat ride to get to the North end of the city (a ten minute walk).

I spent hours reading reviews and checking prices. Liassidi seemed to fit what I was looking for. Yes, it is expensive, but so is everything in Venice. We arrived at the hotel by private water taxi directly from the cruise port. FYI - we were told by the cruise line we would have to get to Piazzale Roma and then pick up the water taxi and that the taxi would only take us to St. Mark's square. Fortunately, the cruse line was wrong. We were able to get a water taxi right outside the cruise terminal and it took us all the way to the hotel. It was 80 euro, but well worth it with all the luggage for door to door service. We arrived before check-in, but the staff was friendly, took in our luggage, gave us a map, and offered us a complimentary water taxi to Murano. They seem to have an arrangement with a particular showroom. We were met by a guide, given a glassblowing demonstration, then a tour of the showroom. It is a nice treat, but also a good opportunity for you to spend money that you might not have planned on spending. Make sure you have them take you back to St. Marks or the hotel, if they take you to Burano you'll be on your own for getting back and it is a 1.5 hour vaporetto ride - found that out the hard way and it put a real damper on the day. When we returned we were shown to our room and they brought our luggage up quickly. Within minutes we were off and running again and thanks to the great directions from the front desk we didn't get lost. Our room faced the courtyard which was nice and quiet. The room itself was nice sized for Europe and clean. There were only 2 English TV channels available, CNN and MTV. We weren't in the room much so this wasn't a real issue. The location was great for getting close to everything, but far enough away from the crowds. The hotel arranged for our water taxi to the airport. - 90 euro. While this is the easiest way, it isn't exactly door to door. When you arrive by water, there is about a 10 minute walk to the terminal.

We arrived by water taxi (yeah expensive, but as an experience it cannot be beaten) and so entered the hotel from the canal. One early word of warning is that if you arrive by the normal waterbus routes then make sure you approach the hotel from the San Marco side as from the Castello side it would be very hard to find. We had booked a junior suite (read large room), not all of these have views but we were delighted to be informed that we had been upgraded to a junior suite with a canal view (Room 405 to be exact). The whole booking in was very swift and very courteous, we were shown to our room and then our bags transported for us. The room, like the entire hotel, was very clean and modern in style but with touches of the old - we had a reproduction Klimt in the room. The bathroom was bright and airy and as well as a shower (which proved to be excellent) there was also a spa bath. One really great touch was that waiting for us in the room was a complimentary bottle of Prosecco and some crisps and nibbles, giving my partner a free bottle of her favourite wine definitely scored major points. Throughout the stay we found the staff friendly and the standard of cleanliness was beyond reproach. The bed, as always on the continent, was two singles pushed together, but at least they seemed to be joined together and in truth the join was barely noticeable. The location of the hotel was very good, only a 5-10 minute stroll from Piazza San Marco and only a little longer to the Rialto bridge. There were two restaurants on the opposite side of the canal, one of which, Il Conchiglea, we used on our first night, it was not inexpensive but the food was very good. We also made use of the nearby Crazy Bar (which is more like a small cafe, though they do serve beers and other alcohol) on a couple of occasions, the Espresso is definitely worth having - be aware that this place seemed to close at about 6pm. If you wander away from the Rio Di Greci (the canal that fronts the hotel) then there are some interesting shops, including real ones used by Venetians, such as a butchers and a barbers. So, to sum up, we found the hotel accommodation to be of a very high standard with really nothing that we could fault, but there is one thing that stops it getting the full 5 marks - breakfast, or to be more precise the hot items. If you stick to the cold items at breakfast then you will have no complaints - the really fussy will make comment that the juices come from a carton - in fact many of the cold items, such as the croissant and the cold meats, were very nice and there was a decent selection of cereals. If, however, you decide to start your day with Pancetta and scrambled eggs then be prepared for, at best, lukewarm food. The eggs and bacon are placed in a metal roll fronted serving container that has a few table lights placed underneath it in a vain attempt to keep them warm. It struck us that this was something that could have been remedied quite easily so I am afraid it costs the hotel a point, I would dock it half a point but tripadvisor doesn't do half points! But, please don't let the not hot 'hot' breakfast items stop you staying at the hotel, it is certainly a hotel that we would hope to stay at on any future return to Venice.", "Date": "April 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portsmouth", "Title": "\u201cSuperb Little Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Julie0865", "ReviewID": "UR15155200", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel over Easter with my parents.

A small but little used bar may be open early evening, but then later on appears to be dependant upon whether any staff are in attendance or not and cannot be guaranteed.

Staff are helpful and polite, although why 6no reception staff (at last count and at varying times) are needed, when no other services are available, did seem very strange. Several requests made prior to our arrival for flowers and wine to be provided in the room, were also conveniently ignored.

We arrived after finding it easily, (once you get to know that streets are actually alleyways and very narrow ones at that, with a squeeze when 2 people are passing each other). The greeting was very welcoming and the dreaded Claudio (from previous reviews) was nowhere to be seen. We were advised of the time for breakfast and given a map of venice and we were offered a trip to Murano glass factory, but we declined, because we weren't interested in the trip. We were then shown our room (No.107) by the receptionist, and the porter followed with our luggage. The room was very impressive, with a hall and the bedroom and bathroom had their own separate entrances off the hall, so it felt more like a junior suite rather than a superior double. We overlooked the lovely courtyard area, which is refreshing to see in Venice, as most hotel entrances only have doorways. The room was clean and we were never disturbed by housekeeping, as the staff always knew when you left the hotel because we were requested to hand the room key to reception every time we left. The bed was remade each evening and 2 chocolates were laid out beside the bed, which was a nice touch. Breakfast was well above expectations, there was above average choice of a hotel with 26 rooms. Pastries, toast, cereals, scrambled eggs, ham/meats, choice of 4 cheeses,fruit, biscuits, yoghurt, 4 types of fruitjuice, preserves, tea/coffee and the breakfast staff were attentive and we never had to ask for anything else, as the breakfast was always replenished before running low on food. The location was ideal, with a 2 min walk to the water bus stop S.Zaccaria, 5 mins walk to Piazza S.Marco. There was too much choice of restaurants, but we enjoyed our meal at the Marco Polo on Salizzada S.Lio and our favourite bar was the Bacari Jazz opposite the Central Poste at the Rialto bridge, which had a generous choice of cocktails and food(but we didn't eat there, we just had our prosecco)with friendly staff. We were also surprised at how good the room rate was. We had perused various internet sites for the best room rate including Expedia, but when I looked on the Liassidi Palace Hotel website, there was a special rate request, we were then advised that if you stay 4 nights you receive the 3rd & 4th night 1/2 price, so in total we paid 570 euros for a superior double including breakfast for 4 nights stay.

We did have a whirlpool bath and after walking the length and breadth of Venice, it was indeed most welcomed! The hotel staff were extremely helpful throughout our stay and were always willing to help if greeted with courtesy and a smile ! The will happily recommend restaurants, things to see and do and provide you with an insiders guide to Venice. We did take up the free water taxi to Murano (It definitely wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t forced upon us), which is worth a visit. Do remember that the staff at Murano are employed to sell and do try their best to ensure you part with your money. The goods are of the highest calibre.......... but the prices reflect this !

On booking I listened to the former, sadly from my experiences the latter may be more accurate. Unlike some posters, I didn't experience any problems with the staff. I encountered Claudio, but had no problems with him. The boat trip to Murano wasn't pushed down our throats as I had feared beforehand. However, for a 4* hotel, this place has a surprising lack of facilities. Actually it has no facilities. It says it has a bar, but we couldn't see one open. No room service (or none advertised). Two small breakfast rooms with a really below par buffet. It doesn't even have a public toilet - after storing our bags after checking out we were sent to the first floor where there is a small toilet that the staff use! I really wonder how this place got its star rating or got onto the small luxury hotels lists - surely you need to meet a certain minimum standard of what you offer guests? What it does have is an abundance of public areas which are hired out for conferences and seminars. One was taking place immediately outside our room on the second day we were there. We booked the most expensive room on offer at the time, a \"suite\" for 390 euros with a canal view. Really, this was a large room rather than a suite, but my understanding is that room sizes are generally small in Venice anyway. It certainly wasn't worth the money though. Especially since the \"suite\" had a bathroom that could only be described as very compact. Yes, the room had a jacuzzi bath (or a standard bathtub with jets - not the corner bath featured on the site), but it was postively liliputlian in size. I'm 6\"1 and of average build and had real problems squeezing in. Venice is a beautiful place and our experience at the Liassidi Palace in no way ruined our stay in the city. However, on walking towards the grand canal I did pass a variety of hotels that I previously considered staying at - the Luna Baglioni, the Bauer and the Monaco. I wish I had.

The hotel staff treated us very well and had a complimentary bottle of prosecco waiting in our room on arrival, which we enjoyed, and it prompted my boyfriend to propose! We will always remember this hotel fondly. If I'm lucky enough to return to Venice we would rebook without a doubt. It is a very good four star hotel, with a few special touches that make it unique and a cut above a standard 4 star. After reading some of the other reviews on this site I was wary of booking via Expedia, so booked directly with the hotel, and they offered a competitive rate and were very prompt and helpful with the booking. Our room was on the small side, like several others we have seen in European city hotels. The breakfast was okay, I've had better when travelling, but it was varied, included in the price and gave you a good start to the day. THe room itself was well decorated in a modern style and well maintained, particularly the bathroom, and we appreciated the turn down service, which you don't often find in hotels any more. The bathtub was a jacuzzi tub, which was nice. There was also a beautiful reading room on the 2nd floor and a nice courtyard outside the hotel. Because Venice is on water there are lots of mosquitos, so bring your spray. There is a good restaurant down the short passageway (away from San Marco) which we visited 3 times, and were always treated well by the staff. AFter the first visit to the San Marco area for dinner, I avoided the restaurants around the Piazza. We strolled into this area one evening and were disappointed by the quality of food, it is very touristy and while our food was inexpensive, we paid three times the amount for a bottle of prosecco that we had bought earlier at lunch. Venice itself is fantastic, make sure to visit Piazza san Marco, the Doge's Palace, The Guggenheim collection, and Accademia. We also took advantage of the 3 day and 1 day vaparetto passes, which we thought were good value for money and also allowed us a romantic trip up the Grande Canal. One thing to bear in mind is that Venice is not the easiest city to get to. Make sure you add plenty of time to transfer from the airport to the city and vice versa if you want to do it the less expensive way. You can take the bus to the Piazzale roma and then a vaparetto to the nearest stop to your hotel, wherever it may be, and don't forget you then have to carry your luggage down various side streets, over passenger bridges etc to get to the hotel.

Here are my quick thoughts: Very difficult to find, but that might be most hotels in Venice. It was not well marked and off a little alley. However, no one seem to know of the property either. Room Layout: The suite #202 we had had an upstairs room that was so warm, it was a sauna. I can't imagine what it would be like in a hot summer. It would be unusable. As soon as you come into the room, you have stairs going up. This would not be for everyone. We had to watch our oldest traveler closely because the floor is all glass and she slipped down twice. Cleanliness: Overall the room was clean. Breakfast: It was beyond mediocre, once the 'buffet' was depleted it was not refreshed, eggs cold and croissants slightly stale.Finally, we would concur with a previous reviewer that the staff attitude leaves a lot to be desired. I don't recall a hello or good morning at any breakfast during our visit. Staff: Patrizia was very helpful with the check in and made us feel welcomed. However, that's where it stopped. The Manager Claudio tried to charge a 50$ extra offering an upgrading already included in the booking. They were useless for finding info on trains, museum access or other information (Concierge Jacky). The only restaurants they could recommend was their own some distance away.We were less than enamoured of a number of staff, and an arrangement they appear to have with a glass factory on a neighboring island. Before we had time to draw breath we were offered a free trip across the lagoon which we foolishly accepted. It resulted in an escorted and rather uncomfortable tour of a glass factory.We faced heavy sales pressure to buy something from the showroom. We spent 3 minutes watching glass being made and 30 minutes winding through a maze of showrooms with a salesperson. No fun.Don't take it! Claudio was particularly rude, even for Italian standards. I noticed that he had disagreements with many guests who came to the front desk.As we checked out, another couple was there with similar complaints so I'm hoping they listen. Basically, stay at the Liassidi Palace for an easy walk to San Marco Square, but don't book anything through them! You need to research before you go and bring a guidebook you trust. Or you can sign up for walking tours/boat tours and ask those people for advice. Anyone but the hotel staff. I'll stay somewhere else next time, because I feel so ripped off from last trip.

We turned it down and were then shown to what was supposed to be the room we had booked \u00e2\u20ac\u201c right behind reception! It was an awful room. While it was quite large, it felt like being in someone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dark, musty basement. There was no bath or bidet, just a shower with assemble-yourself doors. It was room #10 so if you are checking in and that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s what they try to give you, say no immediately. We were in the room no more than 10 minutes when we started hearing tons of noise above us and from the plumbing. We were very disappointed so we promptly asked to be changed to another room. Wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t you know it, there were none available until the next day. Claudio got very defensive and tried to convince us that this awful room was in fact a junior suite and better than what we had booked. I think they just overbooked for that night and tried to pretend that this crappy room was a superior room. Uh, no. Based on some posts by others here, it seems this hotel does not try too hard to please its Expedia customers. In my opinion, if a hotel has a better room available, they should upgrade people for free. There are plenty of postings on this website by people who were upgraded free of charge at other hotels. Now the next day, when we changed to a proper room, #404 on the top floor, things improved dramatically. This room was very nice and exactly what I had hoped for. The pictures I have posted are from this room. It had a large, bright bathroom with a big tub and lots of room to move around the beds. As for the service, every other person who worked at reception was wonderful. We had no further problems. One bad apple almost spoiled our visit. The included breakfast was the worst of our three hotels in Italy but had a big enough variety for me. The best improvement they could make would be to switch from the Tang colored fake OJ to the real thing. The breakfast room is right at canal level so it provides for interesting sights. My last morning there I saw a funeral procession go by with a coffin in one boat and mourners in the next one. Strange but I guess normal for Venice.

It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a pleasant 10 min. walk west of San Marco. I would return to this hotel only if I booked a specific room directly with the hotel. I would not take my chances with Expedia again.

We read the reviews and thought we couldnt lose on this one. It seems whenever we book a hotel with Expedia we get a bad room even if we book an upgrade etc. So this time we booked a 'Superior Room' at extra cost, we arrived via a water taxi to the hotel in the afternoon (well worth doing) and all looked good so far. We were shown to our room (we were expecting a room like the superior shown in the pics) only to find the room had a sitting area about 8 feet square, one window that faced a brick wall and the bed was nowhere to be seen. I looked to my left to see a very angular brass and glass staircase going up the side of the room. There, perched at the top on what looked like a shelf was the bed. Never seen anything like it! Ok it was clean and modern but very dangerous at 4am if nature calls. So thinking about the Superior room pics, we did the very un-British thing and complained (well, politely asked to make sure we had a superior room and to change it). They confirmed yes, we had a Superior room but would show us another two rooms. The second room was a conventional room, nice but gloomy with no view again (this happens a lot in Venice on lower floors). The third room we were shown was the actual 'Superior Room' in the pics. Great, we thought. Only to be told that was 50 euros extra per night! So what was this room then? An extra extra Superior room? So we choose the second. It was only after we moved our bags that we realised it was two singles pushed together (they couldnt be joined) and the new room was significantly cheaper than our original 'faux' Superior. By then we were too tired to take it further and decided to agree to being 'dissapointed'. You can draw your own conclusions as to what is going on there. Other than that the stay was fine, a couple of other minor gripes were one day we came back to our room about 2pm to find it hadnt been cleaned. Tired and hot, we just grumbled, sat down and the maid appeared, so we had to clear out again. The other gripe was the bar wasnt always open for a nitecap in the evening after we came back from dinner. Its a nice hotel with polite and friendly staff but just watch yourselves.

Since I wanted something romantic what better place than Venice ! Stayed from May 25 - 28, 2005 and paid Euro 800 in total for three nights, inclusive of everything. I selected this hotel based on the reviews on this site and want to thank everyone for their candid comments. Allow me to share how our visit went and I will start with the points for improvement and then the compliments: We stayed in a double superior room overlooking the courtyard (room 108). (i) First thing we noticed when we entered the room was that there were many mosquitos in the room which I managed to 'neturalise' within a 2 minute hunt (also very noticable was that in addition to my effort there were about half a dozen other mosquito kill stains throughout the room by othe guest. - hotel needs to do a better job of cleaning the walls, etc or repaint them. I don't understand why there are no mesh screens for lovely windows in the room, afterall this is Venice (built on a swamp and surrounded by water) and mosquitos are not uncommon - so we didn't open the windows. (ii) We couldn't figure out how to turn on the airconditioner but when I attempted to call reception for help, there was no directory in my room or on the phone...so after a number of random attempts, I dialed '9' and reached reception, and asked how to turn on the airconditioner. The receptionist said it was very complicated and sent up a bell boy to my room who arrived very quickly and after we both examined the airconditioner for about 2 minutes and played with the dials, we jointly figured out how to turn it on ! ! However, the airconditioner is a separate floor unit attached to the window - not a problem until you close your curtains at night, at which point the beautiful thick curtains completely enclose the airconditioning unit on all three sides such that no cool air gets out - so my advice is that you either leave your curtains open at night or you crank up the aircon. to the max for about 15 minutes before you close the curtains, and then leave the curtains half open so that some cool air circulates the room. (iii) the cleaning people do a great job in keeping the rooms very clean; however, for our last 2 days, the cleaning people left a dirty rag visibly in the room and bathroom. (iv) Room was very small - I've travelled quite a bit and I was surprised that my room was smaller than that I experienced in Japan; however, I understand that the suites are much larger and so if you want space, you should book a suite and not a room. (iv) web-site for the hotel indicated that there was modem socket which I mistakenly assumed was a high speed internet connection - what they meant was you can \"dial-up\" to the internet the old fashion way (however they do have one computer in the reception area at high speed where you can surf the net. (v) I sat down to do some work at the desk; however, the height of the desk was in excess of the chair seat height - I'm 5'10 and the desk came up to my chest when seated... so don't plan on doing any work in the room unless you can find a few phone books to boost the chair height. (vi) Service - (see positive comments below). What really disappointed me was that on the night before and on the day of our departure we were asking for directions to the airport, the best type of transport, etc and whilst we recieved the right advice, what we didn't know but apparently the rest of Italy knew in advance was that the airport traffic controllers in all of Italy, on the day of our departure, would be staging a strike on that day ! ! Now it is clearly my fault for not re-checking with the airline but you would think that a hotel with only 26 rooms and classified as 4 star would take a little bit of initiative to inform their out of town guest of this critical piece of information, especially as I was checking out in the late morning and re-checking my directions to the airport. Needless to say that really disappointed us and you can imagine what happened at the airport with a thousand people trying to get new flights, etc. Positive points - a very clean hotel (in spite of the mosquito kill marks) and as others have mentioned, decorated very tastefully and I must say, cool ! Breakfast was simple, but very tasty (but bring your own ketchup cause they don't provide it). People - overall the staff were friendly and accomodating. One of the best reception areas I have seen for a boutique hotel and a fantastic courtyard (small but cozy) where you can hangout and relax. Great location and I felt very secure.

We had a fantastic 2\u00c2\u00bddays in Venice, the weather was excellent - plans are already being made to return!", "Date": "May 23, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent\u201d", "Author": "UKtraveler", "ReviewID": "UR3493478", "Content": "Stayed at this hotel with my partner, who is now my fiance!

As previous reviewers have said, the location was excellant, only about a 5 minute stroll from the square, but in a peaceful location.

Just be prepared if you are going here, the mosquitoes are vicious, ask the hotel staff to put a vapouriser in your room, otherwise bites will ruin your stay.
