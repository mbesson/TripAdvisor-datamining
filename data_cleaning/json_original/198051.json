Also, both of our first time to Paris. I don't think I could have picked a better location... the Latin Quarter. We took the RER B train from the airport to the Saint-Michel - Notre-Dame stop. It's about a 30 minute ride. This metro stop is directly in front of Notre Dame. Then we walked about 3 blocks to our hotel. Our room wasn't ready so we left our bags at the front desk (we keep travel locks on our luggage) & walked back to Notre Dame for about an hour then went back to the hotel to check in. If you've read all the other reviews then you know that the rooms are super tiny but they are very clean. We brought our own travel size shampoo & conditioner. There is a room safe that we kept our passports, money & Kindle Fire's in but I'm not sure if it's really big enough to hold a laptop computer. We walked almost everywhere except the Eiffel Tower & Arc de Triomphe. The metro station is a block away. I booked our room over the phone because I wanted to use my AAA discount which is 20% off the online rate. I paid $126.00 Euros a night for the 1 Double Bed, Classic Room. It's February & slow season. I booked my room about 3 weeks in advance. I watched the rates go up to almost $250.00 Euros the last week or so before my trip so I'm glad I booked early. This hotel only has 40 rooms so I think the cheaper, smaller rooms book fast. There is another Best Western hotel on this street BEST WESTERN La Tour Notre Dame but it's not 100% non smoking. A 100% non smoking hotel was a MUST for me. We had room 203 which was right by the elevator and I thought that was going to be a problem but we could barely hear it. Our windows opened to the small courtyard so we didn't hear any street noise. The hotel offered free wifi which was also a must for me. If two people want to use the free wifi then the front desk will print out two seperate passwords for you but you have to ask for them. The free wifi worked fine for the first 3 days but on day 4 it went out & we never got it back. The front desk let me use their computer to print out out boarding passes. The front desk computes are not on the same wifi as the guest free wifi. We ate the hotel breakfast twice which is really good. Breads, cheeses, meats, cold cereal boiled eggs, juices, jams, Nutella & champagne.I paid $14 Euros which is a little high but I paid for the convenience of not having to get out early and walk around looking for food in the cold weather. We enjoyed our nice breakfast & then headed out for the sights. The hotel staff are very nice & helpful and spoke English. We asked for directions & they always gave us good directions. If you want an affordable, clean, safe, free wifi, 100% non smoking hotel in a GREAT location then this is the right hotel for you. If you want all of this & want to smoke then stay at the BEST WESTERN La Tour Notre Dame down the street. I'm so glad I found this hotel. I would stay here again.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "G\u00f6teborg", "Title": "\u201cGood price for the location - but only due to ongoing renovations.\u201d", "Author": "HeiliT", "ReviewID": "UR124991109", "Content": "The room was standard and usually goes for 250 euro a night which in my opinion is over priced for the accommodations.

Location is Latin quarter the best area of Paris, rue Sommerard is a small quiet side street just in a few steps from Saint-Germain and Saint-Michel boulevards where you can find everything needed - restaurants, shops, farmacies, etc. There are a lot of high quality french cuisine restaurants (Zagat rated) located in a few steps around. All main attractions are just in minutes' walking distance - 5 min Notre-Dame, 5 min Pantheon, 20 min Louvre museum, 20 min Orsay museum, 20 min Pompidou center. The hotel is clean, they have non-smoking policy. Breakfast is a bit expensive (15 euro) but it worth: they have plenty choices of cheese, pastry, cornflakes, eggs, fresh squeezed juices, tea/coffee and yes they have champagne for breakfast. Rooms are not that big in size but as I stayed alone for me it was quite enough space in normal twin room with one bed. Btw when I made my booking I've written in the comments that I'd prefer to have room with shower cab and on the high floor if possible. When I arrived I found they've satisfied my request, they gave me 5th floor and room was with shower cab (room 505 btw it has little balcony with view to Notre-Dame's spire which is a nice option). Actually one of the main things of this hotel is great staff, I have to say thanks to all of them for their kind help which is important especially when you're first time in the city. All the guys are professional, polite and really helpfull giving suggestions/answers to all of the questions. They provided me help with different things such as finding right directions/transport, giving warm blanket while it was really cold outside and even solving problems with my mobile phone sim-card.

Cluny Museum and Pantheon only blocks away, and you can buy Museum Pass at the Cluny. Staff was very friendly and accomodating. Room (#307) was very small.

We were told it was to help monitor who was entering the hotel and to keep the ''undesirables'' out. We figured it was actually to ensure that people didn't overload the rooms with guests. We returned the key on our first outing, but that soon changed. When we returned late that night we asked for our key and without having to produce any ID or even give our name we were handed the key to our room. A very obvious and very serious breach of security meaning that anyone could've done the same and being given free access to a room.. On our next outing we simply held on to the key (after a brief argument with the desk clerk) and did so on further outings. Would I return? Probably not given how many hotels there are in Paris and thorough research would probably get us something better for the same price.", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location\u201d", "Author": "warf", "ReviewID": "UR115009554", "Content": "Spent a week here on a business trip in June.

Metro station Maubert-Mutualit\u00c3\u00a9 is around the block - very convenient. Every member of staff we dealt with provided excellent service - friendly & polite - & they offered useful tips for getting around & info about local sights. They let us check in a few hours early & leave our luggage after check-out. Despite Best Western being a huge international chain we got great personal service from this small hotel. The room was compact but apparently this isn't unusual for Parisian hotels. It was very clean & well-kept. There's a electronic safe for your valuables & you have to give your room key to the reception staff each time you leave the hotel so security is a priority. My only complaint would be the popular modern hotel trend for the bathroom to be separated from the bedroom by a glass wall, with a gap in the door, so not much is left to the imagination when one of you needs to use the bathroom - it's best to leave the bathroom lights off to avoid embarrassment ;-) If you are a new couple seeking a romantic getaway in the city of love, you'll get to know each other intimately sooner than you thought! The walls are pretty thin so you do hear the other guests & staff in the corridors but this is true of all other modern hotels we've stayed in so wasn't too big a deal. There is free wifi - the staff will print you a login & password. Note however that you can only use this login on one device at time (eg netbook or smartphone but not both) The lift is very small - only enough room for two people + 1 suitcase - but again this seems to be the norm. Breakfast was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac15 per person on top of the room rate but the quality is excellent - fresh organic fruits, breads, juices, pastries & cereals - the best hotel breakfast spread we've had. The breakfast area is in the cellar & is a very charming space (check the photo on the hotel website). The price is worth it considering how expensive it is to eat out in Paris, plus the fact that it's very difficult to find a cafe open early Sunday morning anyway. If you book your room through a third party vendor & use a cashback scheme you can make a big saving on the prices quoted on the hotel's website.

The bed was very comfortable and was 2 singles together which made for a king size. The bathroom was relatively small but more than adequate with a shower over bath and wash basin.

The hotel also requests you hand your room key in when you leave for the day. A little strange but something you get used to. Tea & Coffee are not supplied in the room however when we asked at the front desk a tray was provided with all the necessities within 2 minutes. There is also a mini bar/fridge in the room. The room does not have airconditioning at this time of year which is understandable however with the room heaters on we found it a little stuffy but did not hesitate to sleep with the balcony door open to allow some fresh cool air.

The Metro is 2 blocks away ,cafes , wine and cheese shops, and an open air market are at the end of the block. I have no idea why anyone would not want to stay at this hotel, unless large and opulent is what you want. But if you want to experience a perfect French hotel, this it!", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Houston, TX", "Title": "\u201cStylish boutique hotel in the St. Michel area\u201d", "Author": "Jemimagold", "ReviewID": "UR20910206", "Content": "I recently stayed at the Best Western Le Jardin De Cluny in Paris from Oct. 9-13 for 4 nights. Our rate was 209 Euros per night for a superior double room which I booked via Best Western\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s website. Here are the key aspects of my stay: 1. Room \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Our room for two people was small but very stylish as you can see from my photos. I liked the fact that it was nicely decorated in a contemporary, unfussy style. There was a nice flat screen TV, a fridge, a safe, a big bathtub and a separate toilet room which had a full length mirror on the door which was handy. 2. Breakfast- Breakfast was not included in the room rate but a breakfast buffet was available for 14 euros in the basement. I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t go there as I think it is much more fun (and cheaper) to have breakfast in a caf\u00c3\u00a9. FYI- there is a caf\u00c3\u00a9 just around the corner from the hotel in Blvd. St. Germain which has wonderful caf\u00c3\u00a9 au lait and croissants. 3. Location- One of the great things about the hotel is its location which is in the St. Michel area (Latin Quarter) but is on a side street off Boulevard St. Germain. It was a simple 3 minute walk to the Cluny-Sorbonne Metro stop or an easy 7 minute walk to the St. Michel Metro/RER stop from which we could catch the RER train directly to the Charles de Gaulle Airport for 8 euros one-way Also, on the other side of Blvd. St. Germain were countless cafes, shops, bakeries, etc\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 4. Air Conditioning- The hotel turns off the A/C in the non-summer months so in order to have moving air while we slept, we had to sleep with the window open. Thankfully it was October and it was relatively cool at night. However, if you are a light sleeper, sleeping with open windows might bother you as there were cars and scooters driving by at all hours as well as an elementary school located directly across the street from the hotel with loud kids in the morning. However, I am a very sound sleeper and I slept through it all. My traveling companion was less happy about it and said she was awakened several nights during the night by shouting people and traffic. 5. Front Desk Staff- They were multi-lingual, patient and very professional. They got us taxis and were helpful with restaurant reservations. We also checked in and out in a matter of minutes. 6. Internet- There was a charge to use the internet (3 euros for 15 minutes) but I think this is very typical for Europe and so that really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother me. However, be sure to ask for the front desk staff for the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153American Keyboard\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the French one has keys in different places and can be frustrating to use (the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153@\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign is particularly hard to figure out on a French keyboard). 7. BW Points- Even though I booked my room via the BW website, it did not automatically put my BW Gold Crown number with my stay so make sure to take the number with you to give to the hotel staff or you will have to email them when you return home like I did. I was pleased with the Best Western Le Jardin De Cluny and would happily stay there again!", "Date": "October 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Penicuik, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hotel\u201d", "Author": "Andrew G", "ReviewID": "UR20880083", "Content": "Rooms a little small, but it's a European city centre.

The lovely surprise was a pretty balcony with a view over the paris skyline - we were on the 5th floor of 6. Some of the rooms seem to face on to the courtyard so I recommend trying to get one with a balcony if you can. The lady manager was absolutely charming and made it a great stay. My mum and I hardly ever go away and if we'd had a grotty hotel it really would have spoiled it so I feel very lucky to have found this one 5 mins walk from the Seine. Breakfast is 14 euros and worth it as it's down in a sweet little cellar with a good spread of breads, cheese, ham, eggs etc - set us up well for our day of sightseeing. Lastly, I recommend walking over to the Ile St Louis for dinner in the evening. It's a lovely stroll and there are some great small restaurants.

The hotel WAS 2mins from the metro station, the hotel WAS 5mins from Notre Damme, the hotel WAS welcoming and friendly, yes the room WAS small but immaculate, clean and lovely fluffy towels. Great area with so much to do and see....... On the main road there is a little coffee shop where you can get breakfast for 2 Euros 90 .....a bargain for paris. There is also a lovely little Greek deli (on the way to Notre Damme) that you can stock up on Mezze, over the road from the deli there is a supermarket where you can grab a bottle of wine, some plastic glasses and a bottle opener....then take yourself down to the Seine by pont neuf and join the other couples and families for a romantic night by the river....cheaper than eating out.....perfectly safe and all within ten mins of the hotel. I would recommend to take a picninc blanket with you for extra comfort. We did this for 3 out of the 5 nights we stayed. The Latin Quarter is lovely, go up to Mouffetard (I think that's how you spell it, about 10 mins walk from the hotel) for drinks and food and a nicer atmoshere than the fixed price menus of the tourist hell that is rue de la huchette, a street away from Notre Damme. The fixed rice menus seem chea but the quality is shocking and the crowds are awful, you'll know where you are when you see the smashed plates outside the French/Greek restaurants there. Although I would reccomend the Jazz Club on huchette, Le Caveau De La Huchette. Full of great characters and everyone was up dancing until the wee hours. It is housed in a medieval cellar and is worth the trip just to soak up the atmosphere and people watch, get there early to grab a seat as after 10pm it gets quite full..and hot!!

We relied heavily on reviews found on TripAdvisor and elsewhere in making our plans. We finally chose the Hotel based on relative convenience to the Metro, room size (two twin beds in a 15sq metre room), a more reasonable rate, and good comments about the staff. From the first e-mail, the staff was prompt and helpful. They provided directions from the airport and Metro; they agreed to a rate found elsewhere on the web including breakfast for two, and also provided a sounding board for Ballet tickets. (Thank you to Morgan, Medjid and Andrea!) We reconfirmed a week or two before arrival, and received a cheery reassurance and welcome. And, when we arrived, Andrea greeted us with early check-in to our room, and even helped to load us into the lift with our luggage. She also provided extensive information on transit and sights, between other front desk business. The information was very useful to us, given our \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rookie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd status, and we changed our first day itinerary as a result. The chambermaids, breakfast staff and other staff were all extremely polite and helpful. As requested, we turned our key in when we left the Hotel, and each day when we returned the room was spotless. I would say that we were a pretty low-maintenance pair of guests. We have traveled to other countries, so our expectations were set accordingly. Having read that rooms are sometimes switched on guests at other Hotels, we were a bit nervous at arrival, however, our room was exactly what we anticipated from the description we had received. The Hotel is on a quiet residential side street, so other than some noise from the TV in the room above, typical for a small hotel such as this, we found the location very quiet. Our room looked out over both a street and the bathroom window opened to the courtyard. We were very comfortable, and had enough room to leave our two suitcases out in the room through out our stay. Our understanding is that the Hotel was fully booked during most of our stay, however, there was always a sense of quiet and peace at the Hotel. We saw a mix of business and pleasure travelers, most of shorter stays than ours, and very few younger children. We chose to eat on-site, thanks to a good inclusive rate, and really enjoyed simply rolling downstairs to the breakfast room in the cellar (shades of Orwell). The coffee was delicious and strong, and the other offerings were extensive enough to give us 7 days of varying choices: chopped fresh fruit, various breads and croissants, multiple flavors of yogurts, meats and cheeses, cereals, eggs, etc. While this is not the Ritz, it was wonderfully welcoming and comfortable. The Hotel is small, but well-kept, and the staff really made us feel at home. They assisted with locating a pharmacy when a cold took hold, and also helped locate an internet caf\u00c3\u00a9 for us when the Hotel computer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard drive fried and we needed to access e-mail. We never felt unsafe in the Hotel or the area, which is filled with students, business people, tourists and residents. (And their dogs - watch where you step in Paris!) There are 3 Metro stations in the area of the Hotel, The Cluny stop being the closest at only a couple of blocks away. We enjoyed the walk to the St. Michel station, where there were more options for various lines. While we bought the books of 10 tickets, we were on the cusp of wishing we had purchased the Carte Orange. We did buy the Museum Pass (6 day) which clearly saved time and money for us -- we covered a lot of territory and this put us right at the head of the line! We did not try taking the bus, although the Hotel recommended this highly. There is a small store selling staples, drinks, wine very close to the Hotel, and multiple bistros, brasseries, cafes and restaurants to choose from.

Odd and a little inconvenient (ie hand washing) but no problem. No shower curtain and water pressure was very poor in shower. Good points: location- was great, very close to RER B if coming in from Gare du Nord (Eurostar) or CDG- very easy even with luggage- no more than 5 mins easy walk with luggage. Also metro line 4 and line 10 very near and some main bus routes -lots of restaurants and cafes -Starbucks and Haagan Das ice cream cafe -staff was friendly and helpful except they failed to pass along a phone message to me (no voice mail) -internet available in basement lounge area for I think 8 euros per hour (we used it for about 15 mins but they said no charge!) rooms clean, smallish flat screen tv with BBC and CNN Room was probably about 12 feet by 15 feet, (not counting bathroom area), and we were told we had one of the largest rooms. We saw a couple of other rooms and they looked very very small. This room defeintely had enough room to have 2 twin beds, table, and floor area for luggage, and you could still walk by. air conditioning worked well, and the large windows opened to a very quiet back street. No real negatives but I would note the following: 1. breakfast is 14 euros/person- very expensive 2. in our room when it rained (as it did 3 days of our trip), there was a very very annoying dripping sound onto the roof above our room- so loud it would wake you in the middle of the night, as it did both my daughter and i. 3. shower was poor water pressure, and no shower door Overall I would likely stay again but get a deluxe room if you can.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Cardiff", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and unbeatable price for Paris Weekend\u201d", "Author": "valleygirlCardiff", "ReviewID": "UR8463048", "Content": "Just got back from a wonderful weekend in Paris.

I'd read others' complaints about noise, but our room, #02 on the ground floor, was quiet, even though the windows overlooked a side street. The front desk service was friendly and helpful. Their English was much better than my French. We didn't try the breakfast in the hotel, preferring to enjoy one of the neighborhood cafes, A few other tips: Despite what looked like a long line on our 11 AM arrival the Musee D'Orsay, it moved very quickly and we got in within 30 minutes. The Museum Pass allows people to by-pass the line entirely, but may not be worth it unless you plan to visit multiple museums. Finding our way from CDG to the station at St. Michel - Notre Dame via the in-bound RER train was easy enough. The outbound to Orly was a bit more challenging, involving a a couple of switches. Note that some of the stations don't have elevators or escalators, so heavy luggage can be a problem. The restaurant that the people at the hotel recommend, the Brasserie Balzar, is OK, though not great, and a five minute walk from the hotel. Adam Gopnick wrote about it in the New Yorker a few years back, but ownership has changed and it may be coasting a bit on its reputation.

The only problem was a delay of about two hours before check-in- which seemed much longer because of our jetlag. The location is wonderful. You are just steps away from Place Maubert, which has several cafes and bakeries. There is also a Metro stop right at the corner. My favorite Paris museum, the Cluny Museum, is only a block away. Several days there was a great street market in the square with an interesting mix of food vendors and artisans. We never had breakfast in the hotel. I did take a look at the breakfast room, which is quite nice in spite of the fact that it is in the sub-basement. I still cannot imagine why anyone would choose the expensive hotel basement breakfast over one of the cafes in the neighborhood. Overall, I would recommend this hotel.

In addition to the nice rooms, lovely atmosphere, decent value for money and helpful staff, another good thing about the hotel (as mentioned in previous reviews) is its location. It is situated on a quiet street just off the Blvd St Michel and is close to good cafes, restaurants, shops and sights. It is also just 5 mins from the metro, 10 mins from Notre Dame etc and you can walk to other central locations, including the Louvre and the d'Orsay within half an hour. It is also easily accessible from CDG airport on the RER. The only negative points would be that our large window wouldn't quite shut properly which meant we could hear some street noise at night. Additionally, we didn't have breakfast at the hotel, instead choosing local cafes, however we found that the choice tended to be limited and expensive compared to other meals.
