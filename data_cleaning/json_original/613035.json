Bathroom OK, but could definitely be much cleaner (esp. dirty shower curtain). I showered wearing my flipflops! Breakfast does not have much coice (no ham or fresh cheese), only bread, jam, and boiled eggs. Hotel is rather far away from everything, in contrast with what their website alleges. Closest subway stop is a good 15 min. walk (although there is one bus that stops close-by, but is much less flexible). You will need AT LEAST a good 30-45 mins to get anywhere interesting by taking a combination of bus and metro. On the upside, our room was very large, and the staff was friendly and flexible over breakfast times.", "Date": "September 10, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "City Hotel Gotland", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d613035-Reviews-City_Hotel_Gotland-Berlin.html", "Price": "$80 - $130*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Urbanstrasse 171</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10961</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> (Formerly Hotel Pension Urban)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "613035", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/ba/c8/bac80b50f69b341c5201e7d76ef1c3d01large.jpg"}}
