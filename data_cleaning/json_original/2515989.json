We were so tired and just wanted some room service. We were told it would take about 45 minutes and it ended up taking 2 hours. After an hour and a half, we decided to give up and go get something to eat somewhere. I called room service to tell them \"never mind\", and they said \"oh, sorry but your food is on its way up right now\". Yes...32 minutes later, our food showed up. It seems like they JUST started cooking it when I called to cancel the order...I found this to be unprofessional, rude, and just plain bad customer service. Why lie?!

I must say the service from start to finish was amazing. We never opened a door, every person we talked to was nicer than the other. They really do live up to their reputation. The location is ideal. Right next to Union Square. Great place for shopping. The few negatives were that there was construction on the street that provided some noise early in the mornings. The showers had horrible pressure. It was really bad. I wouldn't stay here again because of the shower pressure. The outlets in our bathroom didn't work and it took them 2 days to fix it. The walls seemed to be pretty thin, we heard lots of musinc and conversation from both sides at all time of the day and night.

But my bottom lines are sleep and a fitness center. This is yet another hotel with a puny gym. Only 8 machines (3/4 treadmills) or so to serve a 20 story hotel. That makes for morning stress -- the absence of a good stay. I don't know what hoteliers scrimp on the gym -- it is a voting issue for me in choosing a htoel. The second complaint is the hotel shutting off all in-room dining at 11pm. If you work long hours or just fly in, you can't get a glass of milk or even a Special K after 11pm. Hardly inviting. For the vertigo crowd, this is an open atrium hotel. Elevators are nice -- but all are glass. Overall, this is a five star hotel in service and rooms, stuck with a 3-star mentality of guest amenities. They're coasting on the JW Marriott name and looking for suckers. Sorry to be so negative.

The room was very comfortable and spacious, I was on 13th floor and no noise to speak of from the streets. The shower stall was unusually small and from what I heard the shower heads were too low in some of the rooms - the larger folks in our party joked about having to open the shower door to turn around or bend over to wet their hair. I found the internet sign on a bit confusing - had been told WiFi was free from someone in our party but got notice when signing on that I would be billed. Signed on anyway and it didn't appear on my invoice (possibly contracted w/my company to waive fee?). My company had booked many conference rooms for meetings and breakout sessions and breakfast and lunch were catered through Marriott. The food was very good at our meetings, though the salad portions were a bit skimpy in the boxed lunches. There was a great selection of coffee syrups and teas available. I ordered room service breakfast the last morning - the veggie/eggwhite omelet that I thought would be healthy was heavily coated in oil and not very good despite it's high price tag. I was in a hurry at checkout and didn't scrutinize my invoice closely, discovered when I did my expense report that they had charged me for mini-bar items that I hadn't used twice, for a total of $19. Due to the many days' delay I didn't dispute, I just paid it out of my pocket. I learned my lesson - make sure you thoroughly read your invoice at check out. The location is wonderful, a very short walk to shopping, mass transportation and lots of restaurants. Since I was on a business trip with others we shared a cab from the airport but I would have been fine with taking the train otherwise. The cabbie refused to take a credit card, leaving us scrambling for cash to cover the bill - not the hotel's fault of course but just a note of warning to those who don't carry much cash, it surprised us all.

Staying here for the ease of getting to us without the climb. Always loyal to a Marriott when visiting San Francisco, but first time at JW. The location as others have commented is central; rooms are 'standard' but with many amentities such as upscale bath products, two full length bathrobes and as others have also commented....try to get a corner room for the extra size. This one that we are in is on what they call the club level since husband is a Platinum but they use for gold members as well if there is room. It is the service that is outstanding here, twice a day maid, refrigerator installed when requested, offer to change rooms if we did not like the one assigned...that kind of thing. Wonderful concierge (and in this regard we are very partial to Ric at the Stanford Court, our usual mainstay...but it is equally excellent here). The club lounge is wonderful. They supply little bags that if you prefer to take your food upstairs or wherever, you may do so. Also, lounge is open for breakfast SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. This is very unusual in United States. Selection is very good as is food preparation for the breakfast, stopped in to look at the dinner offerings when we arrived and also looked very nice. Desserts are extensive and this we did try last evening about 9 ....literally 6 or 7 choices and room for you to sit and chat comfortably and look out at a very lovely view. We are without a car but took the Super Shuttle here in 20 minutes time for 40.00 including gratituty for two persons. There are very good restaurants and obviously great shopping or browsing in this area that can be done without having to take a taxi. We are here a few times a year and in season you simply cannot depend on that cable car to get up the hills, the lines are l hour long at times and taxis are not all over. So, if you are here and want a good solid choice to a dependable Marriott product with ease this is the place.

As for the hotel itself, it was nice, but we have stayed in nicer JW Marriott\u2019s and even regular Marriott\u2019s. We actually have preferred our stays at the Marriott Union Square on Sutter St. a little more than at the JW because we always had better views there. The hotel was close to Union Square, handy to restaurants, and within a convenient, brisk walk to the Moscone Convention Center. We stayed at the JW 5 nights January 22-27 during a business trip. As Platinum Elite members, we were upgraded to a Jr. Suite, Room 922. We were so happy with this beautiful, very large room (sitting area part of the room \u2013 not separated), until we saw that the view was of the monstrous air-conditioning plant and nothing else. There was no view of the city whatsoever. We spent one night in this room & the next day asked for a room with a better view. They moved us to 1607, on the opposite corner of the hotel, and while an office building directly across Mason Street obstructed the view, we could at least see down to the street & had an ever so small view of the city by craning our neck & squinting our eyes. Still, it was better than the enormous air-conditioning plant view of Room 922. (Since it was a business trip, I didn\u2019t have my camera with me & regretted that I couldn\u2019t take photos). Because the hotel sits rather low, getting a room with a view is difficult here unless you stay on the very top floors. Aside from the lack of any city view, both rooms were spacious, though with a different layout. We liked the 922 Jr. suite better than the 1607 Jr. suite. Room 922 seemed much larger than 1607, newer, cleaner, and had a much nicer bathroom than 1607. Room 1607 seemed a bit worn to us. Both rooms are decorated in warm shades of gold, green & red with sofa, chair & ottoman, granite-topped & glass-topped furniture, leather-topped desk (w/uncomfortable mesh ergonomic chair). The rooms had good lighting, but in room 922, the lighting was confined to the desk, bed & armchair area on one side of the room. There was no lighting at all by the sofa on the other side of the large room, making it difficult to sit there to read. The marble bathrooms had both a tub and a separate shower stall. While the marble was pristine & shiny in Room 922, it was rather dull and not as clean in Room 1607. (Example: the shower in 1607 had hardened bubbly soap residue \u2013 perhaps left from a previous guest because the shower walls were not wiped cleaned between guests?). The toilet in room 1607 did not flush well, and although we called maintenance to fix it, it still was behaving badly. We figured it was beyond fixing & just gave up. (No such problem with the toilet in Room 922). The other downside to Room 1607 is that the floor grout was horribly dirty. Though I can\u2019t say for sure, it almost seemed to us that there had been some water damage from an overflowed toilet. There was some street work underway on Mason Street (under our window in 1607), and at 7:30 am we were subjected to the cacaphony of jack hammers and back-hoe banging. (We had our windows open because the room was rather hot & stuffy). Thank God we were already awake! My advice is to avoid both of these rooms (922 and 1607) if you insist on a great view. The standard room 1514, assigned to our colleague (who is not a Platinum Elite member \u2013 just lucky I guess) is the one you want to ask for. Room 1514 was a corner standard room with windows on two walls and a spectacular view. However, probably the higher rooms, say, above the 15th floor, in the hallway from X15 to X22 will have a lovely view, judging from the superb view from the Concierge Lounge on the 21st floor, which was on the same side of the hotel as our Room 922. The Concierge Lounge had a lovely panoramic view that included the Golden Gate Bridge, the Twin Peaks, and the ocean (or bay). It had lots of soft lounge chairs with low tables and standard Concierge Lounge food & service. Although we never had a full meal in the hotel, we did enjoy a light meal one evening in the lovely bar area on the 3rd floor. The food was excellent, and if you are not going to eat there, at least, order those wonderful \u201cSpicy Nuts\u201d to go with your cocktail. The flatbread pizza was so good, we had it twice.

I read reviews of this hotel, as I usually do on Tripadvisor and had some concerns about noise level, but decided to try. This hotel was former Pan Pacific at the corner of Post and Mason, there is another Marriott on Sutter, a block away. I always request high floor and stayed on 18th with city view. The lobby on the third floor and the property has gone through renovation and it is well done. Reviews on Tripadvisor complained about small bathrooms, but all marble bathroom was sufficient in all respect, bed was comfortable and noise problem was not an issue. I think I heard a siren once during my stay and as far as hearing people on the street below, never had any problem. They do charge $49 plus tax for parking, but unfortunately that is the going rate parking in San Francisco with in and out privilege. You can park in Union Square parking for $34 per night, but no in and out, so if you want to stay in the city, you will have to endure the cost. San Francisco has a wonderful transportation system, so if you are staying in city center, take the Bart to Powell Street station and use public transportation to avoid expensive parking fee. I did not dine at the hotel, but with so many places near by, no need to pay expensive hotel prices for mediocre food. I stopped at St Francis Hotel Lobby for 2 glasses of wine and one plate of appetizer and the tab plus tip was $54!!! There is no views, just mob of tourists roaming around the hotel to look see, none guest type. My suggestion for a cocktail is top of the Hyatt in Union Square with a commanding view of the city is much nicer, especially for sunset and it's cheaper. One other experience to share; I originally booked for two nights and when I decided to extend by one additional night, I was told the hotel was booked and they can accommodate me for $279 rate. I sat down with my Laptop and searched for the same hotel and to my surprise, I was able to confirm $ 169 senior rate for the same day? The moral of this experience is don't take no for an answer!

This group of hotels is the top of the line in the Marriott Chain, and until now, I've never been disappointed. However, the JW Marriott leaves a good bit to be desired. The hotel and rooms do not seem or appear to have been updated in a while, and the overall quality of the hotel is not in line with other JW Marriott properties I've stayed in before. The entire hotel seems dark and gloomy. When I checked in, I was \"upgraded\" to a Junior Suite which was located on the 5th floor. However, the noise level from the street was unacceptable - it was as if the traffic was right in the room with you. Additionally, the air conditioner in that room was not working, and would only put out very hot air. Since the room was almost 80 degrees when I first entered and it couldn't be cooled, I opted to have them move my room. The room I was moved to was also a \"Junior Suite\" and was nice - but the internet connection did not work and I immediately had to call for an engineer to come fix it. As for the room itself, as I mentioned, it is not the most \"updated\" property I've stayed in. Also, it seems as if the shower stall in the bathroom was an afterthought. It is very small - not much room to turn around in, and if you have any height over 6', you will probably bump your head on the shower head which is positioned near the center of the stall. Several of my coworkers commented on the same issue with the small shower, so it seems to be the same throughout the hotel. The concierge lounge is adequate, however, I have never seen more than one person working there at a time. However, at times, it was rather busy and it's all they could do to keep up - there definitely needs to be more help in that area. Also, breakfast is scheduled to start at 6:30am during the week, and while much of the food was out at that time, there were quite a few mornings when the hot food (eggs, oatmeal, etc) was not ready to bring out until at least 6:45. Not sure if this was a kitchen problem, or if it was an overwhelmed conceriege employee. The hotel isn't awful, it just really doesn't live up to the standards of a JW Marriott.

This location is truly a JW brand. Granted, we were placed on the 20th floor with a City View, so I'm not sure if other levels and views would leave you with the same impression. The 3rd floor lobby is warm and inviting with a fire place, atrium, sitting alcoves, great bar and friendly service. We usually don't get impressed with elevators, but this place has the best. Fast, efficient and plenty for the number of guests. Don't think we ever waited for more than a few seconds for one to arrive. As soon as we entered the room, we knew we had landed someplace special. They have interest with different wall colors and architecture, not your usual \"cookie cutter\" style room. The view from our rooms were fantastic and extra special at night. I hate being trapped in recirculated air hotels and the windows opened a bit to allow for fresh air....nice! The bathrooms are generous for a city hotel. They also added A LOT of mirrors to make the space seem larger. The only drawback was the size of the shower. We are a thin family and you had to be very creative about how you were going to shave your legs. Like my husband said, when you towel off in the shower you wipe the walls dry at the same time. We had connecting rooms and the place they adjoined was perfect. Usually, they seem to place the connection near the bedroom area, but this hotel had them down the hallway between the closets and bath. It added more privacy, yet still convenient. I can understand the complaints about the street noise, but the hotel is in a prime and busy location. I'm a very light sleeper and I did have to resort to my Ambien stash for a few nights even on the 20th floor, but we were staying there over Thanksgiving and Black Friday. The streets were full of action, people partying, etc. Overall, it did meet and exceed our expectations in most areas.

If you're driving - please note that parking in the city will set you back at least US$24/overnight, and US$55/overnight on-property so do be prepared to accept this. This JW Marriott property is housed in a classic building with internal bubble lifts and the lightwell design where the corridors open up inside makes the property look very big and roomy. The service was very good from the Valet to the Bell services (again to help with the already ridiculous shopping-stuffed luggage bags). Breakfast was not included but there are many diners around the hotel that serve us full meals for an average of US$11/pax! Rooms here are very well appointed and large (for Asian Standards) and features the Marriott Hotel digital entertainment system. I think there was a gym here but am not sure as spent most of our time exploring the city. My only suggestion is that perhaps the shower cubicle (as the shower and bathtubs are separate) also have a flexible hose shower head as not everyone likes the rain shower head fixed above. (and we didn't use the bathtub although it has a flexible shower hose as it didn't have a shower curtain - just might get the whole bathroom all wet...) Check-out was very convenient and straight-forward and overall a very pleasant property. We had an exciting morning the day we checked out: as we were preparing to leave for breakfast, the fire alarm for the hotel sounded and since there was no warning in our rooms about a scheduled test we assumed that there was indeed and emergency so we evacuated the building. Once outside a management rep informed us that it was a false alarm (but the SFFD was already there!)! Good thing we were just on the 8th floor so the walk down was considered an appetite-starter! :) It was very easy to find the fire exit, map located on your room door!

Obviously it\u2019s in a great spot, one block from Union Square. Close enough to be a short walk from everything downtown, but just slightly removed from the max noise of the Square. The room we had was large and very well appointed, looking new and impeccably clean. The bathroom was also large, with a bath and separate shower, all done in tasteful marble. The bed was particularly excellent; just the right level of firmness with loads of squidgy pillows. We slept very well. We had room-service breakfast a couple of mornings and it was about as good as it gets for a US breakfast i.e. the best. It arrived dead on time, brought by a courteous person. There was more than we could eat and it was delicious. We did pop into the bar once for a drink and it was comfortable if rather corporate. Not somewhere anyone would go unless they were staying at the hotel though. There was a restaurant area but it looked little-used and was not even mentioned in the room\u2019s hotel guide, so I can\u2019t say much about it. The staff were universally friendly and helpful. Always ready with a smile and friendly word. Check-in was quick and efficient. Of course, there were a few niggles. Things that might or might not bother you but as private (rather than corporate) travellers they did take the edge off the stay for us: First off, there were the seemingly unnecessary extra charges. Let\u2019s face it, this place is expensive; you are paying a location premium and it\u2019s a good hotel, so why charge $13 a day for internet access or $55 a day for parking? Both of these can be had for half the price locally so the hotel really doesn\u2019t need to rip off their guests for these services. If your company is paying then this might not bother you but for us it just meant we had to spend a little time finding cheaper wireless internet and parking, time that the hotel could have saved us by not being so mean. That price premium is reflected elsewhere in the hotel - $5 for a couple of strips of bacon, $13 for a glass of chardonnay, $18 for a movie. At a room rate of $269 a night, they really shouldn\u2019t be hiking up the prices like this. Only other niggle, and it\u2019s not so big, is the lobby/reception area. There isn\u2019t one really or at least not on the street front. When you arrive it looks like the entrance to an underground parking lot, with a few chairs for smokers; when we arrived I first thought we were at a service entrance. Once inside it\u2019s just a smallish elevator waiting area up to III, where the lobby proper is. Then it\u2019s very nice. One more small thing: The room was a double, yet had only one chair to sit on to eat our room-service meals. This meant one of us had to perch on the edge of the high bed to eat. This might be a reflection of the hotel\u2019s more usual single business traveller clientele. So, in summary, it was a lovely stay, the room and service were excellent. If you aren\u2019t on any kind of budget and don\u2019t mind the slightly impersonal feel of the building and bar then you should have a good stay too. Oh, almost forgot to say...Make sure you get dropped off at the right hotel! There are at least three Marriotts close by and its all too easy for a taxi driver to take you to the wrong one when you first arrive - as happened to us.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Troutman, North Carolina", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location\u201d", "Author": "MSportsAuto", "ReviewID": "UR116345301", "Content": "Great hotel, friendly staff.

It's about 6 blocks from the Moscone and a bit of a walk especially after standing in a booth all day or when you have to go back and forth. The rooms are very comfortable modern and have everything a business traveler or tourist would need. I had a corner room on the 20th floor and it was a great location with view of the golden gate bridge on days without fog (3 out of 9 days). The king bed is comfortable and lots of good pillows. Bathroom is nice with granit and marble but very small shower. I am not a large person and it felt cramped. A tall or large person would not feel comfortable in that shower. The water power was really bad and it took a long time to get the shampoo out of my hair every day which was a big negative for me. Otherwise everything was positive with room and service. Nice bathrobe, little slippers, good bath products, lots of towels. Turndown service every evening, newspapers in the morning at the door step. Very good concierge, great Bell Man Team.

Our first impression upon entering the hotel was \u2018wow\u2019 and we seemed to repeat it quite often during out week\u2019s stay. Check-in was a breeze and the ladies on the front desk were very friendly and efficient. There was a slight problem with the room type allocated but the ladies changed it without hesitation to the one we were after. Indeed, I was really impressed with one of the ladies who actually remembered my name when we stopped by to check something out later on in the week \u2013 that has never happened to me before! The lifts in the hotel are very different from any others in that you can watch the floors rise/fall as you go up/down because they are glass lifts. It did take a bit of getting used to! Our room was on the 11th floor overlooking Mason Street. The room was massive! A large bed with a sitting area to the side, a large desk with a comfy chair and the large flat screen TV. And a big plus from other Marriott hotels we\u2019ve stayed at \u2013 firm pillows!!! The air con worked very well and you barely heard it working. The bathroom was massive too with a separate shower although it would have been better if the shower head hadn\u2019t been fixed to the wall. I liked the toiletries that were in the bathroom, the moisturiser especially since I didn\u2019t take any with me \u2013 and no, you didn\u2019t have to pay for them! As for those who have mentioned noise \u2013 yes you heard the odd fire engine pass but it wasn\u2019t loud enough to really cause any major hassles. I can\u2019t say we heard any other noises from either the street or the atrium given the way the hotel is laid out. The concierge lounge was a great place to go for breakfast or somewhere to go in the evening either pre/post evening meal. The ladies were very friendly and helpful especially the one on in the morning. And the view from the lounge earned another \u2018wow\u2019 from us too! We ate at the bar a couple of nights - that mac & cheese was absolutely delicious! The bar staff were very friendly to you as were the restaurant staff the night we ate there, so much so they used to come up and chat to us when we were sitting in the bar having a drink. I wouldn\u2019t say that either the bar or the restaurant was over-priced. The location of the hotel was great \u2013 just minutes away from Union Square and the main shopping zone of the city.

There was something about plug sockets built into the headboard that was disturbing. The colors were bland and it was basically a bed, desk and TV. In fact, the room seemed to be built around this big flat screen TV, as if that was the only important detail to them. It was a standard room and probably meant for the business traveler. I did not sleep well, probably because my pillows were very lumpy. The hairdryer was awful and started to burn my fiancee's hair. We paid to store the car for a day, which was $50. Since we were only staying for one night, we asked the front desk if it would be alright to leave the car while we shopped. She said we had already paid for a full day's rate and would be fine. When we went to pick up the car, they asked for an additional $15, since we arrived at 5:30pm, even though we arrived around 7pm the night before.

I stayed at this location from 23 to 25 April 2011. I arrived on a Saturday morning in hopes of getting an early check in prior to heading off to a Giants game with a friend. I had requested two beds in the room and confirmed this with the agent at the counter when I tried to check in. She told me these rooms were in high demand and none were yet available for check-in. No real problems there. I am not quite bold enough to expect a guaranteed early check-in. However, as I am a Platinum member, I asked if I could wait in the Club Lounge until either my room was ready or I went to the game. I was a little shocked to hear the lounge was closed on the weekends. I think this is a first for me - every other Renaissance or JW I go to overseas (and often domestic) has this facility open on the weekend for the enjoyment of guests. I resigned myself to waiting in the admittedly expansive lounge area near the Front Desk. On the Sunday night of our visit, my friend and I visited the Club Lounge for some snacks and drinks. This Lounge features an Honor Bar, even for Platinum guests (at least if that is not the case, I was not informed). For those not familiar, this is a bar on a counter with little sheets of paper. They expect you to mark your drinks as you go and then give it to the attendee so they can charge your room. I refuse to pay for drinks at a Club Lounge, as they are often free at every overseas location (and again, some domestic). I did not see anyone else in the lounge drinking. There were maybe six other people. Once I went over to examine the Honor Bar set up, and I thought I felt the collective eyes of the lounge visitors on me to see if I would be the first to grab a drink and not fill out a sheet. I did not. The attendee did not say one word of greeting to me or my friend upon arrival at the lounge. Needless to say, we did not feel overly welcomed, and left shortly after arriving. It was a disappointing experience. People staying at this property should be advised there are a multitude of vagrants in vicinity of the property, especially at night. You will be harassed once you cross the street in any direction, guaranteed. Consider yourself warned. I secured a late checkout of 3PM on the Monday I was due to leave. Despite this assurance from the front desk, there were three different visitors to the room knocking. Between the cleaning crew and the guy trying to check the mini bar, I felt they were trying to get us out of the room. Also, my Guest Folio provided for the agreed upon charge, but the hotel overcharged me (as seen upon my credit card bill), and I am currently having to take my time to discover what the additional charges were so I can dispute them.

It is safe area and access to shopping and theatres is easy. However, I really think that this hotel should be designated a \"Marquis\" rather than a \"JW\" by the Marriott corporation. Why you may ask? Well, I am quite prejudiced having enjoyed countless nights at the JW in Hong Kong where the attentive service in unmatched. If you have the opportunity to treat yourself to this extraordinary experience. Well back to the JW in SF. When I booked it for my family and me, I just presumed that it had all the amenities of a JW. It was disappointing and the amount of money paid per night (269) was not worth it. Why? 1. JWs, even the new one recently built in Chitown, has a pool (or at least plans to open it up). With young kids in tow, I was anticipating have them enjoy the pool and fitness area. There was no pool and the fitness area did not have steam or sauna area - very much like the Marquis in NYC. 2. Again, I don't like to belabor this, but other members have also raised this concern about Marriott. I put out thousands of dollars to stay at Marriotts exclusively over one hundred nights a year. Legitimately, I should have written \"the business,\" but I am \"the business!\" I have a simple expectation: to be treated like royalty. Now there are some Marriotts that do this. A small one in the shopping section of Poughkeepsie had my name on a welcome board. At first thought, I was embarrassed, but then thought they did it right. Why can't the front desk personnel here at this location thank me for my patronage and also offer me a premium room. I am tired of having to barter and bargain to get an upgrade. 3. Being a premium member, I have access to the concierge lounge, but this space was unappealling. Everyday my family had to negotiate whether to take the watery powdered eggs or not. Recommendation: make those little signs and place them in front of the food products so people know what they might be eating instead of having to wait to find the employee to explain the two choices (at night). There must be a number of premium members utilizing this space, because space is a premium when trying to find a place and enjoy some food. I am not sure what exactly the employees do except fill the refrigerators with drinks. Food then tends to run out and guests have to wait ten minutes for the employee to get the food from downstairs. One cannot expect the lounge level personnel to do anything more than fill those refrigerators and set up/dismantle the buffets. I asked very simply for some help with theatre tickets and faxxing something only to be told that those services are carried out by the concierge desk on the third floor. Again, a Marquis, not a JW. A JW would have an employee on staff for faithful guests. 4. Housekeeping needs some adjustment on two fronts: toiletries and turn-down service. Our family was given this small face soap bar (1!) for the shower and one for the sink. We thought it might be a mistake, but when the second day arrived and one of them was replaced (not two), we realized that we needed to find a Walgreen's for a more human sized soap bar. On the issue of turn down service, why is it between 5 and 6? We'd be out all day and return to enjoy a nap. Then we realized we had to coordinate our time around the evening service. It should be later.

Valet parking was +50$ (with taxes) which, even for the city, seems ludicrous. We never even took our car out. 2. There is only one comfortable chair to sit on. The desk chair is excellent for computer work, but for cocktails and visiting doesn't do the job. 3. Charging for the Internet is ludicrous. If we had stayed a few blocks away at the Courtyard by Marriott it would have been free. In this era, charging for the Internet is like having to put quarters in the box to make the TV play or the bed shake. 4. Thank God that the windows open, because this hotel is like an oven inside. Even in the dead of winter (and yes, SF does get cold in winter) we could not have survived without having the windows open full tilt. Open windows also helped with the pervasive smell of mold (which is still better than cigarette smoke of course, so Thank You Marriott for blazing that trail.) 5. No ice machines. In the US. Really? When we travel abroad we expect that, but not here in the US. The \"butler\" service does gladly bring you your allocation of 12 ice cubes of course. Fortunately, there are several Walgreens nearby, and you can buy a 3-pack of ice for less than 3$. And there is no tip required. 5. The bathroom has nice stone work which is going to deteriorate quickly because they don't clean the mold out of the grout. I mentioned this last year when we stayed, we had a different room this year, and the problem was the same. A little Tilex would go a long way. 6. The towels and bath rugs were frayed. Like mine at home actually. But I wouldn't charge someone $200 a night to use mine.:) 7. Check in was S-L-O-W and we arrived about 7:00 pm,, well after the onslaught. And there was only one person ahead of us. And she was checking out. Check-out (once again) could not be accomplished through the TV. Why bother to pretend to offer technology that clearly never works? Overall, there are so many other choices in this area that next time we will want to try something else. Probably we will select one of the \"Orchards\" properties.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cLOVED San Fran!\u201d", "Author": "rrvj4", "ReviewID": "UR53518509", "Content": "Great hotel... great area!

Weekends in downtown San Francisco are curious - hordes of tourists from all over the world give downtown give a somewhat theme park feel to the city. The absence of locals detracts from the experience, but that being said, the JW Marriott is exceptionally well located right near Union Square, and not too far from the BART/MUNI on Market. I arrived to SFO, and walked to the JW from Powell Station. Don't let anyone tell you that you have to take a cab to/from SFO or Oakland airport. Unless you have industrial sized luggage, take BART from the airport. Arriving early in the morning, I tried for an early check-in, but the room wasn't ready. This isn't a huge gripe except Marriott has an option for early check in - subject to availability. I wish they would simply remove this option since there's really only downside for the hotel. It creates an expectation for the traveller and makes the hotel say 'no' to something on first impression. Notwithstanding, they were very gracious to take our bags and we went sightseeing in the meantime. The room was exceptional. Sometimes the Marriott interiors are so generic it's impossible to tell whether you are in Bangkok, Boston, or Bangalore. This is different - great pictures with SF themes and a true luxury edge to the room made this very special. Service was very good - I ordered a wine and cheese platter which came promptly as promised. The cheeses were excellent quality, Stilton, Camembert and Jarlsberg and beautifully presented. I travel a lot and it's clear they pride themselves on going the extra mile here. Downsides: I don't blame the specific hotel for the early check-in disappointment, but Marriott really does need to give better guidance as to how likely it is. The only other problem was all elevators were not fully functional which led to some delays lining up for the elevator, but this was minor. Upshot is: An excellent quality five star hotel which meets all expectations. I do recommend travelers to SF venture farther afield than downtown and explore places like the Mission, Haight, and Castro to get more of a real SF flavor.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lebanon, NJ", "Title": "\u201cWedding weekend\u201d", "Author": "gpec24", "ReviewID": "UR48976640", "Content": "We were staying at the JW Marriott for a long weekend in which a family member was getting married.

That was the high point - and our first impressions were quickly extinguished by several cleanliness and service issues throughout our stay. Even more importantly, the high-rise hotel abounds with hazards to young children with some windows that are too easily opened by curious toddlers. In my in-laws' room, the casement windows could be opened entirely - without any stops or locks of any kind. It was frightening and shocking that a hotel of this stature would allow such a hazard to go unmitigated (Room 1109). Our room, 1111, had windows that were easily opened by youngsters - but had stops on them. Still, the window opened widely enough so that a small child might be able to slip their legs through - so we were still quite jittery about ever allowing our daughter to get too near them. The cleanliness of the hotel was also a big problem. On arriving to our room, and using the toilet for the first time, I noticed some \"resi-doo\" under the seat that I had just lifted. Disgusting. Also, the glass shelves adjacent to the sink looked like they had not been cleaned in weeks. The brown-colored granite may have been nice when the hotel was new - but coupled with my toilet discovery, dirty shelves and dim lighting - I got the creeps. Once in the shower, the water pressure was SEVERELY lacking. And I know everyone is trying to save water, but why do we need to be subjected to water flow that more closely resembles an eye-dropper? The gym contains some unusual and awkward equipment is kind of dirty. Definitely not a fitness \"club\" - but a smallish room packed with mostly treadmills, elliptical machines, etc. Go someplace else - this hotel looks like a Marriott on the surface, but operates more like a Holiday Inn.

But is was unfortunately the second time in a row this company which flawlessly communicates any and all marketing opportunities in advance of your stay, failed to communicate rennovations in advance.

On top of that, there is a \"15 second rule\" posted in the door of the fridge that, in essence, says that if you remove any item from the mini-bar for more than 15 seconds, you WILL be charged for that item (plus the approriate tax and $20 \"re-stocking fee). The towels and linens were very rough on one's skin. Next, our one dining experience at the hotel restaurant was acceptable, however the food service during the conference (especially breakfast) was poor. The food was usually cold and a bit greasy - not what one would expect in a city that touts organic foods and a healthy lifestyle!

I'm a Marriott Platinum member (i.e. I stay in Marriotts 100+ nights a year) so my treatment might not be typical for all guests. First impressions were 'hmm' - the hotel looks very nice, but, strangely the lobby was on the third floor, with the entrance on the first floor. As we were driving there we were also a bit stuck as the hotel's driving entrance is actually on Mason street, and due to SF's one way system this wasn't so easy to get back onto, so, if arriving by car try and get onto Mason/Post. Parking is expensive in San Francisco in general, you are better not bringing the car if you can avoid as you certainly don\u2019t need it in the city. There is a Hertz location in the hotel, and there is also one on Mason street that is less than a block away as well. However, arrival was great, the hotel lobby is lovely, and the roof actually opens up all the way to the top of the hotel (21 floors). The elevators also look out on the same view, so it can be really nice to be travelling up to your room if you're on a high floor (or to the bar/rest area on the 21st floor). Got to our room on the 18th floor, it was nicely big, and had a nice view in that we could just see the bay and it is always nice to be high up. (See the photos on this review to see the view we had). The bed was a typical Marriott one (i.e. lovely and relaxing), the bathroom was very well presented with marble, bath robes provided (nb: one under the bathroom sink for some reason, the other in the wardrobe as usual) and a lovely shower. My wife also enjoyed the bath. The TV was also very nice - a huge 42\" High def affair, with a lot of channels choice. As a nice touch the room also had a 'valet call' button - so you could press it and the valet would come to your room, a nice touch (a little like the 'butler bell call' in old style houses in England). The room also had an ipod base to play music around your room (didn't have one to know how well it works) We also had access to the club lounge, on the 21st floor, for breakfast and nibbles. It was quite busy, but, had amazing views of the city, a very comprehensive breakfast (more like an American breakfast than a continental one), and they'd even lend you a DVD player if you wanted. Service from the staff was great, and they even allowed us to check out late as our flight was in the evening. Everyone was very polite and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay - just a shame that it was only for a single night. Final point on location - though the hotel claims to be on Union square it is actually a block away... doesn't make any difference, but, a minor point. But, otherwise the hotel is in a great location - excellent shopping within a few blocks, the same with the cable cars. The area was also very safe late at night with lots of traffic and light in our view.

We had a late check-in on a Friday night, around 8:00 PM. I had requested 2 double beds and specified I would be traveling with my girlfriend . Upon check-in they basically said (looking down the end of their noses), \"Too bad, there are only king beds. If you have a problem with that you need to take it up with your \"booking company\". \" Although we had used a \"booking company\", with parking, our room was $355.00 per night. Not exactly a paltry sum in my book. I didn't really feel like we were being cheap in any way, but that is exactly how they made us feel. I definately had the distinct feeling that booking indirectly is looked down upon. We headed to the 8th floor, walked into our room and thought things might be looking up a bit. The room seemed spacious, and it appeared the bed was an Eastern King, so sleeping with my girlfried in the same bed 2 nights might not be as awkward as I thought. I proceeded over to the window to check out the view and was greeted by a solid wall of the adjacent building. I guess we would have to take that up with the \"booking company\" too. The last straw for me was breakfast on Sunday (our only meal with the hotel thankfully). We shared oatmeal, a fruit plate, muffin, and both had a latte. Our bill with tip, was $31.00. The oatmeal was beyond bad, we could barely choke it down. The fruit plate (one banana and a handful of berries) was $15. The bran muffin???????? I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.

San Francisco is a great trip if you're looking for a long weekend vacation. A few notes: - Cab from SFO to hotel which was located in Union Sq was about $35 dollars. As always, knowing approximate cab rates is always important so you don't get ripped off. - The JW Marriott for a luxury hotel is what you expect in a city like San Fran. Space is pricey, so the rooms were nice, but small. Large flat screen tv was a plus, but for a JW, the luxury was minimized a bit by the space. Also, the bathroom was fairly large, but felt very dated. Service is great though, with an in room butler button for your use. A few times I requested towels and other items, and a person came to our door in less than 5 minutes. As for the hotel itself, the restaurant and bar was undergoing construction which is scheduled to be done later this summer. Should be pretty nice as it'll be brand new. Hotel location was ok, union square doesnt have much 'sites' but a good shopping and walking area. Trolley cars and bus lines are just 2 blocks over, and the neighborhood is also walking distance to Chinatown, Nob Hill, the Financial area and a large mall as well. - As for attractions, make sure you hit the regular spots, nothing wrong with being touristy. I recommend: Chinatown is great for dinner (better dinner than breakfast to be found there) and the old fashioned bakeries are great. The Golden Gate Bakery has the best fresh egg custards. Alcatraz tour is pretty interesting, and you can purchase tickets in advance on the internet which gets you on the shorter \"will call\" line. For baseball fans, catch a Giants game. Even if the teams are just ok, tickets can be had cheap and you'll definitely appreciate the park.

Next step was check-in and having never been to the hotel before, I didn't realize you had to go to the 3rd floor for check-in until I asked someone else on the 1st floor that looked about as lost as I did. Check in once we found it was quick and pleasant. We had a very well appointed room on the 16th floor, the bathroom was probably the nicest area in the room. I have seen Renaissance hotels (another Marriott line) and other JW's with nicer rooms; the look was fresh and modern but some of the furnishings looked a little too well used. Checkout was slow because the checkout through the in-room TV did not work and there was a lengthy line at the front desk downstairs. The concierge lounge breakfast was almost top notch and the concierge recommendations on area restaurants were most welcome.

Large flat screen TV, many amenities and one of the most beautiful bathrooms I've ever seen in any hotel. We were on the 14th floor and we never heard any sounds of sirens, etc. and the rooms were extremely quiet and immaculate. But even with all this elegance we agreed the best part of the JW Marriott was the staff, from the bellmen to the front desk, concierge, restaurant, bar, housekeeping and valets and every person we met. They smiled, were genuinely friendly and always greeted us, gave some excellent advice on where to eat, made reservations, etc., etc. In Hawaii we speak often of Aloha spirit and it actually is a lovely thing, but we all agreed that we had found real Aloha spirit at the JW Marriott on this trip. Interestingly, many people here told me I would be disappointed in San Francisco as it was dirty, lots of druggies and homeless (I had lived in Palo Alto for 5 years and spent a great deal of time up in the city). I am not sure where these people were, because we all found it super clean, with friendly people, streets very clean and even the homeless we did see were neatly dressed and did not hassle us and we walked everywhere with no problems. Would we go back again - in a millisecond! It's a wonderful hotel with a great staff in an ideal location in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. JW Marriott San Francisco thank you for an unforgettable vacation.

We placed our bags on a bell mans cart,Then a staff member ran up handed us a claim ticket and shooed us away.We then went up to check in that was pleasant . We then went to our room we wanted to freshen up before our meeting ,The room way nice but had been freshly painted the outside balcony still had a large amount of plastic where they were still painting.We had to wait almost a half hour for our bags to be brought up to the room. The bellman insisted he receive a tip he just stood there ,Of course we tipped him. As a matter of fact ,All the Staff were so pushy for tips even for a bucket of ice (the hotel wouldn't allow us to get it ourselves) We stayed two nights at this Jw Marriott .We tipped to the tune of almost $250.00 to this pushy lazy staff. The bed linens were Not changed and were clearly soiled,The maid also did not vacuum or wipe anything down ,We were happy just to receive clean tiles. My husband works for the Government (The hotel would not honor any discount ) That was okay ,We also own a Rare Coin and Jewelry Company ,It was the principal of the matter. I am also disabled and at the other Marriott at 55 fourth street ,I was not charged for handicap parking .This hotel charged us approx. $88.00 a night. When we arrived back to the hotel the second night of our stay the valet parking attendant rudely stated he thought we had checked out??? What an insult ,I explained to him we were staying two nights . He rudely gave us another claim ticket for our auto. I then went inside to talk to someone at the front desk ,Their was a young dark haired Asian man there, He also was nasty, All I wanted to do was make sure we were Still booked for two nights ? He told me yes ,Then I asked about the parking situation with handicapped parking ? He stated Each Marriott was independently owned and operated and their Hotel Valet was Separately ran and they had nothing to do with Valet (what)...I then had valet bring our auto back we moved it to the corner where their was a handicap parking on the street. upon checking out that next day we carried our own bags down ,I waited for my husband to get the car ,While I waited I could hear the Valet parking attendants laughing goofing off. I wanted to go back in and talk to someone at the check in desk ,But after the Nasty Rude person I spoke to the night before I was frankly a little Scared to. After my husband brought the car round four of the valet parking attendants ran over to open the doors really pushy ,My guess is they wanted More Tips.Hum maybe because they were holding their hands out with their palms up? When we received our bill for a regular room two nights stay ,We were charged two nights valet parking even though we moved the car. The bill came to $880.00 without any room service or anything else. Wow I don't ever want to pay to be treated this way again.I did make a call after we returned back home to Reno Nv.

LOCATION: The location is great - - right off Union Square behind the Westin St. Francis. RENOVATIONS: Although this hotel is going through a total renovation, you hardly notice it. I was impressed with how quiet the workers were. They hardly made any noise and certainly had no effect on my enjoyable stay. They are closing one floor at a time for renovations starting at the top and working down. I think the top 5 or 6 floors are done. The lobby is scheduled for renovation beginning in November. VALUE: This is not the most luxe, beautiful, or celebrated hotel in S.F. but it's an excellent choice and an excellent value when you consider that its rates are 1/2 or less than those at some of the 5-Star luxury hotels nearby.

First, the location is ideal. One can easily take the Bay Area Rapid Transport (\"BART\") from SFO for $5.15 and arrive at the Powell Street station, emerging from the subway right smack dab in the thick of the The City where Powell meets Market Street. Roll with the good times up hill a few blocks past Union Square to the JWM and check in with a friendly desk clerk at the third floor lobby, which is a bit dark but serene. One of four glass enclosed elevators will come quickly to fetch you from the lobby and take you up to one of 22 or so floors, down a hall that is light and airy, to a room that is clean, bright, comfortable and well appointed. The room features a king bed with soft sheets and a fantastic assortment of pillows, from soft to firm, short to long, down-filled to polyester; I counted at least six. I was impressed, particularly since hotels far too often overlook or skimp on this essential ingredient for a good night's rest. The room has a good working thermostat, wet bar, small fridge, Bose clock-radio (but alas no CD player), coffee maker, flat screen television (but alas a small one), and cotton robes (but alas no slippers). The carpet looks good and crown molding adds a nice touch, but some of the furniture is dated. The window treatments were effective and the windows actually open, but they are not double-paned or noise proof. The bathroom is well laid out with attractive fixtures, mirrors and marble. There is a separate glass shower, a full length tub, myriad toiletries, and plenty of towels. Maid service in the morning and turn-down in the evening were exceptional. On the topic of service, the JWM folks I met were friendly and response time for ice from room service (since there are no ice making machines) was stellar. There is an adequate gym for working out on the 5th Floor with televisions, complimentary towels, water bottles and apples. There is no sauna, jacuzzi or pool (got to go to the Ritz Carlton or the Nikko for those features). Following the major redo of this property which I am told is underway, I would expect room rates to rise as well.

This property does not have Marriott's Revive bedding, and the mattress was stiff and firm. My back ached after one night. The location just off Union Square is very good for touring the city. Instead of the hotel restaurant, which was very expensive, we ate at Lori's Diner across the street.

My vacation is scheduled to end Sunday, but I wanted to get this down while it was fresh in my mind. The hotel is a nice hotel. However, I must agree with a previous poster and say it is a little dark and drab. I think because of the Asian theme. It is not as beautifully decorated as other JWs such as the one in Atlanta or the one in Cancun Mexico. Even though this is the case, it is still decorated nicely. This is what I liked about the hotel Staff: Upon arrival we were upgraded to an executive level corner room. Everyone from the housekeeping staff to the concierge is very helpful. The staff is always offering to help. Rooms: Again, I don't particularly care for the whole cream, brown, black decor, but the rooms are large with very comfortable beds. I will say it appears the furniture could use some changing out as the tables in our room had a multitude of scraches as did the chest outside of the bathroom. Room Service: The food was exactly as ordered and was good. Of course room service is expensive, ( Breakfast for 2 was over $40!) but it was really good. Location: Hotel is close to everything. We went to see a play at the Lorraine Hansbury Theatre and all we had to do was walk 1 block up from the hotel.....SWEET! Union Square is only 2 blocks away and Chinatown is only about 5 blocks away. You are also 1 block from the street car line that will take you down close to the Fisherman's Warf. The Bathroom: Great!!!! Towels are so nice and he products on hand are good too. Cleanliness: The entire hotel was spotless. WHAT I DISLIKED.... Small LCD TVs - These TVs are too small to be in these large rooms. Although they are clear, it is still very hard to see. Doesn't matter to me if there is a TV in the bathroom or not, but the main TV should be large enough to see. Decor: Like I said earlier. I did not like the color scheme. Made the hotel too dark. Needs color. I know it's the Asian theme, but if this hotel wants to be known as the JW Marriott and not the Pan Pacific, the decor has to change. The robes: C'mon. I have never seen a JW with the waffle robes. The robes need to be the deep, plush, soft, long terry robes. These little robes barely covered me and I am not a big woman.

Avoid rooms facing Post or Mason Street if you enjoy sleeping. Stay instead in the back corner of the hotel, though even there you'll hear a bit of noise due to the JW's horrible windows. Annoying! * Small LCD TVs - standard rooms come a 23\" Gateway LCD TV, which is ridiculously small given the size of the room and table it sits on. Can't a so-called \"luxury\" hotel afford 26\" or 32\" units? * Mediocre service - was checked into a smoking room after requesting nonsmoking. The next day while I was at work, the hotel moved me to a nonsmoking room without warning and neglected to move half of my luggage. Was locked out of my old room and had to visit front desk to figure out what happened. Good intent, but horrible execution * Dull decor -- interior atrium is a bit dark and drab.

In the beautiful bathroom were robes, a small television, big mirrors, a telephone, a large tub and a separate shower. We also had our own personal butler simply by pressing a button. Our butler brought us sugar and salt for our food, 10 extra hangers, extra towels, and even gave us bath beads/salts for our bath. The hotel staff members are experts on San Francisco. For every question we had, and we had a lot of them, the staff had a prompt reply. They supplied us with maps, directions, and recommendations.

They also provide complimentary car service (during certain hours), and the driver was great recommending restaurants for us. For those that like to work off the excess calories they have ingested while on vacation, the hotel has a very nice gym with 3 televisions, water, and complimentary fruit to snack on.

We stayed here for 2 nights. I had a high expectation of the hotel since my family and I had stayed many many times at Pan Pacific around the world and had always experienced a first class service. Goods: - We were assigned a room for disable, therefore, there was only a shower and no tub as promised. We asked to be reassigned and the nice man who checked us in previously was able to reassign us another room with a tub. He was very friendly and accomodating. - The room was nice.. very spacious. Liked the design. - The bed was comfortable. Lots of extra fluffy pillows. - A perfect location. One block from Union Square. Close enough to walk to the shopping area, but not smacked in the middle of the crowd. - Loved the big bathroom. A small TV in the bathroom was a nice touch. Loved taking a bath and watching my favorite sitcom at the same time. The bads: - The \"doormen\" were unfriendly. Not even once they ever said hello or smiled at us when we walked by. In fact, one time my husband said hello and was ignored even though he clearly was looking at us. - Another bad experience with the unfriendly \"doormen.\" We were told the hotel provided a car service. We asked a doorman if the car would take us to Japantown. He started laughing and condesendingly said, \"That's 15 blocks from here.\" A simple \"no\" would do. - During check in, the nice man I mentioned above mentioned I should take advantage of the butler drawing bath for guests. It sounded nice, so I thought, why not. So, when we got to the room, we requested the buttler to draw me a bath. First of all, the butler lady was so puzzled when we requested it (I checked, it was listed as one of the services they provided guests). When she came to our room, she asked me if I would do it myself. She gave me a bowl of bath salt and left. I didn't mind doing that myself, but you cannot advertise your service and not deliver. At the end, I could only rate this hotel 3 out of 5.

Service levels, unfortunately, depend greatly on the individual employee you encounter. I was checked into a standard room with a non-working TV and two double beds (I'm 6-4.) When I returned to the desk at 11:35 PM, with all my luggage in tow, I said, \"We'll have to try again - the tv won't turn on with either the remote or the button on the TV.\" Without looking up or giving me any eye contact, the clerk said \"We'll have engineering go up in a bit.\" This is at 11:35 PM. Not the answer I expected or was looking for; certainly no apology or empathy. So, I escalated with \"Well, given that I'm 6-4, I'd prefer a king bed anyway, so let's go ahead and try another room.\" The clerk's response: \"We don't have any king rooms left.\" Said in a flat tone of voice, still without eye contact. Lucky for me, the clerk who had originally checked me in (with good hospitality) came out at that moment and recovered nicely for the other clerk, immediately placing me in what PP calls a \"junior suite\" but what is actually a larger corner room with a king bed. If this Pan Pacific property reminds you of a Hyatt, with its vertical interior atrium room arrangement, it's because it's a Portman pre-Hyatt design. Lots of thick walls, thick marble, thick circles. The rooms themselves are large and reasonable, but dated. Bathrooms are generous but very \"Family Affair/Buffy/Jody\" in their decor - too much almond/beige, including all fixtures. The TVs in the rooms are far too small and, with only standard-definition signals coming in, the result is a too-soft, smeared picture. This is not a hotel to stay in for any views of the city. Additional snarky service was experienced at the hotel bar and by the concierge. My colleague asked the concierge if he had any tape to secure a box. Without looking up, the employee rummaged in a drawer, produced a roll of plastic tape, placed it on the counter, and went back to their paperwork. For this class of hotel, one expects at least \"Certainly sir, here you go;\" \"Would you like me to secure that?

Although we had standing reservations at the Prescott across the street (I stayed there years ago and loved it) we decided to give the Pan Pacific a try after seeing a special web promotion offering a superior king room for just $129/nt + tx. We were not disappointed! First, the Pan's location is excellent. It's a stone's throw from Union Square, but situated just far enough from all of the square's traffic noise and crowded sidewalks. It's also a short walk to Market St., Chinatown and North Beach making it a great base of operations for a SF vacation (and for people who love to see a town on foot!) Our 8th floor room had a decent view of the Mason & Post intersection and it was comfortable and well appointed. Features included an exceptionally large bathroom, separate dressing area, and a tastefully decorated bedroom. We enjoyed the three phones and the Herman Miller desk chair, but best of all was the room's ultra-comfy pillow-top bed. I'd put it right up there with the \"heavenly beds\" featured at some of the Pan's competitors (e.g. Starwood properties like W or Westin). I slept really, really well on this trip (not often the case for me) and I have to give lots of credit to the bed! From the front desk, to the bell hops, to the personal butler service available on all floors, the service was consistently professional, warm and friendly. Speaking of the butler service, the butlers we encountered were prompt, friendly and gracious. While this service is a unique and welcome feature at this hotel, we were a little surprised to learn that it's also the ONLY way to obtain ice for your room. It would be nice to also offer guests the do-it-yourself option for ice, rather than summoning the help each time. Between ringing for the butler, waiting for a phone call back for clarification, followed by waiting for the doorbell or knock, and then the awkwardness of whether to tip each time...well... it just seemed like a few too many hoops to jump through (and a few too many minutes to wait) just for a simple bucket of ice. I have to clarify that this is not so much a complaint, as it is an observation/ suggestion. Please - don't let our little ice delivery issue keep you from checking out this fine hotel... In summary, the Pan Pacific's prime location, friendly staff, tasteful room design (well-represented on their web site) and some VERY comfy beds all added up to a great stay.

I've seen other reviews that talked about the radio alarm going off unexpectedly. Yes, that happened to us also at 6:15 a.m. When I first arrived at check-in, there was only one person at the desk initially. The man--an early 30ish male, stocky build, with a receding hairline, dirty blondish hair and LONG bangs combed backwards--was helping another couple which was fine.

Another note about the room - the street noise is pretty loud at times; I woke to the sounds of bottles being dumped into a bin from the lounge across the street and the ambulance/police sirens a few times as the windows are single-paned and don't keep out sound very well. The workout room on the 5th floor was nice, and it seemed to be getting regular use from the hotel guests. It was maintained very well.

We run a B&B, so the idea of having someone else do the concierge, cleaning, and hosting was great. We were also looking forward to sleeping in as we are always up early to prepare breakfast for our guests. Check-in was uneventful and we got the type of room we booked (booked through Expedia even though a direct inquiry to the hotel showed no availability). The room itself was very large (it was a Deluxe King) and the bathroom was really nice. The tub with seperate shower was a plus as my wife could take a relaxing bath while I showered. It seems that the trend in hotels is to provide very large rooms. I don't understand why someone needs such a large room, particularly when they are very sparcely decorated, as was this room. It just made the room feel a bit cold and empty. There was a nice LCD TV, but again, when placed in a room that was so large, it looked really small. Believe it or not, I think a smaller room would've felt much more comfortable and luxurious. The problems began as we got ready for bed. Just as we were about to turn off the lights, my wife noticed a stain on the duvet cover. Upon closer inspection, there several stains (coffee, make-up, etc) and it became obvious that the duvet cover was just plain DIRTY. I called reception and the person who answered said he would send up a replacement. There was no apology and I could not detect the slightest feeling of concern from the person who answered the phone. Housekeeping arrived about 15 minutes later. Unfortunately, the person at reception did not tell housekeeping that it was the duvet cover that needed replacing, not the sheets. Housekeeping (who was very friendly and helpful) brought up new sheets. He looked at the duvet cover and said that they did not have extras. So we asked if he could bring us some extra blankets, which he did. While the blankets themselves were a bit ratty (one had a cigarette burn), they kept us warm. The bed was adequate, but it was NOT the Sealy they boast about in the book they have in the room that boasts about the high level of attention they pay to each guests individual needs. Rather, the mattress was a basic flat mattress with an old featherbed placed on top. We had asked for an 8am wake-up call but didn't need it. At 7:15am, we were awakened by the sound of construction work going on at the adjacent property. We could not go back to sleep. So much for sleeping in. Upon check-out, the person at reception asked how our stay was. When I told her that aside from the dirty duvet cover and being awakened by the construction, it was OK. She gave a nervous laugh and said \"Wow, that sounds adventurous. I'm sorry.\" I guess she did say sorry, but it was obvious she didn't want to ask any questions and did not want to know any more about it. So much for close attention to their guests individual needs. If this is what you get with a 4-star property and for $269 per night, they can have it. I'll go back to small bed and breakfasts where the owners take a personal interest in making sure each guest's needs are attended to and that each guest is completely happy with every aspect of their stay.", "Date": "July 29, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Florida", "Title": "\u201cLeft my heart at Pan Pacific\u201d", "Author": "JSB5150", "ReviewID": "UR3702830", "Content": "Just returned from San Francisco three days ago.

The hotel' s location is great -- it is within walking distance of many many stores/shopping. It is a short distance (5 minute walk) to the cable cars, Chinatown (walking distance a little longer), if you are renting from Hertz I believe they will do that for you (at least I know they will return the car for a $5 fee), and many other restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner. They are also close to several drug stores and mini markets. The hotel is beautiful inside and the rooms were roomy for 2 adults and 2 children with 5 pieces of luggage. The service and concierge were exceptional and went out of their way to do extra things for us. I cannot say enough about this place and the people who are working there. After going to Yosemite and several others places we needed to return to San Francisco for our return flight home and wanted to stayed again at the Pan Pacific which we did.

The Pan Pacific is one of the BEST hotels I've stayed at in San Francisco. Booked through Expedia for (I think) $140 a night for a Superior Room.

I LOVED the suite I was upgraded to. Now about the suite: Opened the door and heard lovely jazz music. Walked in and saw the living room. Very nice TVs and Bose Clock Radios. Also a very nice first bathroom. I then opened up the sliding french doors to the bedroom. Great beds, not too soft and not too hard. Just right! Great desk with egronomic chair. The view was great but I could see some buildings. I woke up one morning to a guy staring straight into my room from across the street. He was pretty far away, so it's okay. Very nice master bathroom with a small but good television in it. Very nice overall! Now about the service: Service was very prompt. Didn't order any room service so I cannot comment on that.

One block from Union Square, 6 blocks from Moscone Center (where my conference was being held), and restaurants right when you step out the door. 10% off Macy's Coupon when you check-in which is great. Starbuck's is only a block away which is EXCELLENT since I practically went there like every two hours. Walgreen's was about two blocks away, which is also EXCELLENT for getting soda, snacks, and other stuff.

The Pan Pacific San Francisco is a terrific hotel in a great location. The hotel serves as a great base for exploration of the city. You see, San Francisco is a compact city that is best explored on foot. From the Union Square location of the Pan Pacific hotel, you can easily walk to Chinatown, North Beach, and even Fishermans Wharf. When you visit, make sure to ask the concierge for restaurant recommendations. Although it's easy to find many great restaurants in San Francisco, the Pan Pacific concierge offers a variety of restaurants that tourists wouldn't ordinarily find. Example: Jardiniere near the Civic Center. The concierge arranged for an anniversary dinner for my wife and I. This was one of the most enjoyable dinner experiences ever. Jardiniere is not a tourist restaurant with a view of the city. Instead they offer a fantastic meal served by people who pay attention to every detail. One additional word of advice for those visiting San Francisco: Bring your walking shoes!

I think what they have done with the TV's in the bathroom is a terrific idea. How nice to lay in a tub after a hard day and enjoy the tv. The resturant for lunch was nice.

The only downfall is the parking which is $47 a night. Then again, I got the room for $90 on Hotwire, so I can't complain.

I was never so disapointed in my life. For the price of this hotel I expected alot. I didn't get it. This hotel is not attractive in the least. The rooms were cold and sterile, all white, plain. The 2 beds in the room were tiny, not even doubles. They were each like a slightly bigger twin. The only nice thing was the bathroom. But how much time do you spend in there? The worst part of the trip was the bellhop pounding on our door at 1am, he said he was there to check us out and take our bags? I guess someone wanted to check out in the middle of the night, it wasn't us. The bellhop was confused so we called down to the front desk. They could care less, they didn't know what was going and frankly didn't seem to care. No apology, nothing. Also, parkiing was $42 per night plus 14% TAX.

It's right in the middle of it all and you can walk everywhere. However, I was unimpressed with the service. I was here with a group from work for the Builder Show last June, but the staff did not seem very hospitable. The only person who cracked a smile was one of the doormen. Other than that, don't expect much hospitality or warmth. The rooms were very spartan but the bathrooms were magnificent. I loved having the tv in the bathroom. Plus you had a separate tub and shower, though the shower was pretty small. The amenities were really nice too. But other than that the room was very basic and dull.

The hotel has no panache at all, it is a very sanitary, lifeless hotel. The staff is courteous, when you can find them. The bar/lounge is a joke, and it is so quiet in there you feel like you are at a funeral viewing. When my wife and I do go back to the Union Square area, which we definitely will, we will stay at either the St. Francis, Hyatt, or other which we have had much better stays. Added tip, do NOT eat at Asia de Cuba, which is the restaurant in the Clift Hotel. The food was extremely overpriced, $100+ per person for very small portion and no drinks, and the service was the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. The food really was not all that good either, I would give the food 1 star out of 5--Panda Express has better asian food.", "Date": "December 30, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "JW Marriott San Francisco Union Square", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g60713-d81444-Reviews-JW_Marriott_San_Francisco_Union_Square-San_Francisco_California.html", "Price": "$231 - $533*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">500 Post Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">San Francisco</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">CA</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">94102</span></span> (Formerly Pan Pacific Hotel)</span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "2515989", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/e0/c1/e0c19f4544dd2238b400e2f4575aa87a7large.jpg"}}
