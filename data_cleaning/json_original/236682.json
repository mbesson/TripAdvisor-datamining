{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Never stay here again! We had a wedding party of 15 staying in the hotel and would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone! Not only were the staff extremely rude, they shouted abuse at the guests, and threatened physical assault on my brother-in-law and mother.On check-out, all guests were offered to keep their bags in what should have been a secure area, right beside the reception desk, only to discover later that jewellery and video cameras had been stolen. The police arrived twice at the hotel (at which point the staff became over-friendly) but without proof and in the rush to catch flights home nothing was resolved.If you are staying in Frankfurt, please avoid this hotel, as you do not want this type of accommodation to ruin your stay.", "Date": "Jun 6, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR931268454", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Good, clean hotel in interesting area This is a small hotel in the Bornheim Mitte area about 20 minute walk to the North-East of the city.
