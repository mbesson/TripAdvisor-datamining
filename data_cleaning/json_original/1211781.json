{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Do not go here! I want to share my extreme disappointment regarding my stay at the hotel Hoppegarten in Berlin. Berlin is such a wonderful place that it was a real pity that we stayed in such a terrible hotel. My partner and i were under the impression that Hoppegarten was much nearer Berlin then it actually is, however we were OK with the distance when told that the hotel was within walking distance of the station- It is not. And when we rang the hotel to ask them how to get there from the station- a woman answered to tell us (rudely) that we'd need to find our own way- we eventually found a taxi an hour later- as the receptionist would no give us a number nor order one for us. This poor service continued. Housekeeping would come (we knew this as there would be hair bands scattered around our room that weren't ours) but no work would have been done. However the poor service climaxed when my partner used the internet here. He paid for his time and the PC would not let him on- the receptionist, an exceptionally rude older woman with dark hair- told him it was working and refused to look at it. As it wasn't working, he insisted that somebody look or our money be refunded. She came over and rudely pushed him out of the way while muttering under her breathe and then after entering a few passwords that we couldn't have known, the PC started working. We had been polite in spite of her rudeness, but when a group of German tourists entered the foyer she began abusing us to them in German- obviously unaware that we knew enough German to understand the gist of what she was saying. She publicly and loudly humiliated us in front of a foyer of people - this was the final straw. When we told another staff member we would be complaining we received a fruit bowl delivered to our room- however the next morning, this woman was just as rude. Due to the low grade of cleanliness and service I insist- do yourself a favour- do NOT stay here.", "Date": "Dec 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR462556213", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "glober85"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d1211781-r22526510-Hotel_Hoppegarten_Berlin-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "1211781", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
