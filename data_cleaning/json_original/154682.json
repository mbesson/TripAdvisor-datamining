This is definitely the worst place I ever stayed at that rates itself as a 5 star hotel. This was built in the 70s, and is well kept for an old property (fairly clean), but it is old, and not in a charming way. 1. The matress feels like a marble countertop. My bed at home is pretty hard too, so for me it was manageable, but still a bit too hard. 2 people traveling with me said they could not sleep at all. Pillows seem to be made of stones too. 2. The toilet is leaking - on the above the sewage part, but still. 3. The lobby bar turns on elevator music style piano player, and you can hear it in the room for the whole 2 hrs of the concert every evening. 3 nights in a row so far, extended coverage on Friday. 4. The gym of this 18 story hotel has a total of 3 treadmills and one elliptical. The elliptical was broken. The treadmill I ended up on was very old fashioned, with a solid metal frame. As I was walking on it for some 15 min, a gym attendant came up to me and asked nicely if i was getting any electic shocks from it. She offered me 2 towels to put on the handrails for insulation. I am not kidding. 5. The lobby bar looks like it was built in 1972 and has the appropriate period music on. 6. Most of TV channels got interference so you can't really watch them. No English speaking channels (I speak Spanish so I don't care, but I can see how it could be a turn-off). 7. The mini-bar in the room is locked with a key and you have to call downstairs to get it open. Would not be as bad if they did not keep the coffee packs in there too. 8. Speaking about coffee, breakfast coffee is more like coffee flavored water. 9. Speaking about coffee flavored water, I ordered room service tonight and asked for hot tea - a large pot. I got a large pot of hot coffee flavored water (same breakfast coffee pot..). In case you are not a tea drinker and don't know how bad this tastes, imagine that your coffee was brewed with tea instead of water. Same stuff. The problem did eventually get resolved, but it took 75 min and 2 coffee pots. I am writing this about 2 hrs after I ordered my tea, and about 45 min after I finally received it, so I am still irritated, but hopefully staying objective... Is this place terrible? No. No major health threats (though don't use the 'ice machine' - I saw the bucket they pour the ice from...). No real safety issues. The employees are friendly. Would I stay here again? Absolutely not, and would not recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta, GA", "Title": "\u201cnice hotel but terrible beds\u201d", "Author": "chuck1063", "ReviewID": "UR56078513", "Content": "My local office booked me at this hotel when I traveled to Mexico City last week.

The rooms are very large and if you get a high exterior room you'll have a great view over the city (ask for the back side of the hotel, more quiet and better view). The bed was very big and comfortable and I had everything I needed: big desk, arm chair etc... The bathrom did seem a little old but it was functional enough. I dinned at the Naranjo's several times and it was worth it. Most of the employees were very pleasent (specially the maids) but the front desk people not so much.

Here is my review: Positives: - Pool in the pent house, very nice view of the city from the top of the hotel - Travel agency in the hotel were very friendly, they have a lot of different tours to choose from - Lounge area by the restaurant where you have a piano player, a nice place to relax - Rooms are extra clean, the furniture looks very attractive and nicely chosen - Bell boys service was good. - Staff and waiters at the restaurant were very friendly and provided very nice service. - Location, it was safe for me to walk in the streets around the hotel even during the night Negatives: 1. Noise, if you are in a room in the center of the hotel atrium, expect to hear the piano playing until 11:00 PM while in your room. Worse, if there is a party going on in one of their dancing halls, it may continue to 3:00 AM in the morning. Therefore, make sure to ask for a room as far away from the noise as possible if you want to get some sleep. 2. Internet charges: They charge you by time intervals, 12 hours (92 pesos )or 24 hours (138 pesos). I thought this was inconvenient for a long stay, it would be nice if they charge one flat rate for the stay or provide the internet for free like other hotels in Mexico city. Sometimes you can negotiate to get 24 hours for the price of 12 Other tips: - The Taxis standing by the hotel are super expensive. You can stop a green beetle taxi or a white and red taxi for your ride instead and save up to 80% of the price. However, be careful and make sure the meter in the taxis are working. - There is a nice taco restaurant I liked very much by the hotel, it is called El-Caminero. It was not very expensive (around 80 pesos for dinner including a drink). The food tasted extremely delicious!!

I found the hotel to be a good value for the money, at least in Mexico City terms. It has pretty good amenities--a pool, small gym, and business center which are rare in hotels in this price category. I was pleasantly surprised by the cheaper of its two restaurants Naranjos. The food was quite good--a nice blend of traditional Mexican and international. A good value for the price. I ate at the more expensive restaurant one night and paid a lot more for food that wasn't really all that good. The staff are helpful and friendly, and the rooms are very clean as someone else pointed out. However, the hotel has 4 negative points that ultimately have led me not to return. 1) Internet is only available in the rooms on the courtyard side of the hotel. This side of the building has virtually no natural sunlight reaching the rooms. 2) Rooms on the street side are very noisy. Reforma is a MAJOR avenue with very bad traffic jams. (Of course, you get a bird's eye view of all protests, which can be interesting). 3) Even the rooms on the street side are very dark, and frankly depressing. 4) The entrances to all the rooms are on a central atrium. This is an interesting architectual feature and quite attractive (in a 1960s/70s kind-of way), but it's not such a good arrangement if you are a single woman. You can see what room anyone goes into from pretty much any point in the atrium, including the restaurant. So, I felt a bit vulnerable. Overall, it's a good choice for people on a budget. Like so many hotels in the center it was built during an unfortunate period for architecture and style, so the rooms and furniture are funky colors and a little awkward. But, that's not their fault.

The hotel is centrally located in the business district, on the Paseo de la Reforma, and is very accessible by public transportation or cab.

The rooms are large and have a sitting area in addition to the bed and bathroom. Our room was quite dark, even with all the lights on and curtains open. It overlooked a dark courtyard so that didn't help. I'd recommend getting a room looking outside the building if possible. The gym is very well equiped for a hotel, even has a punching bag. And the restaurant (Naranjos) is good and reasonably priced (though much cheaper food can be found elsewhere in the city). If you're looking for tourist information, don't expect too much from the hotel, it doesn't seem to devote much attention to that. And I speak spanish so I can't attest to their english speaking abilitites. The hotel is a nice walk to the Zocalo and the Zona Rosa (it is inbetween the two) right on a main street. A few other tips: don't use the private cabs just outside the hotel door (that the door men will offer you).
