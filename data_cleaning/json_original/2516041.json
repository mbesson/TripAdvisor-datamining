Upon questioning the agent when I finally got up to the desk (we practically had a mutiny to get their attention) she said their policy is to always serve Premier/Platinum first. So the rest of us don't count at all? We could have stood their all night if a few of the people in our line didn't start getting quite vocal. In addition, for those of you who choose vegetarian/vegan lifestyle, this hotel has absolutely no vegetarian/vegan options - not even a baked potato! Upon calling room service to ask about vegetarian options, she was quite indifferent and said \"there's a green salad\". I travel a lot and am willing to be quite flexible in putting together a vegetarian meal with sides, etc, but their room service had absolutely no interest in working with me. Lastly, they gave me a room on near a road and their was quite a bit of road noise all night. Thank goodness for Ambien. Needless, to say. I will never stay their again, and I am quite vocal about these things so I will be spreading the word. It at least rates a 1 for the bed. Great bed.

The nice gentleman on the phone said not to go anywhere he'd be right up with the keys. So, after waiting 10-15 minutes I called down to the desk again.

We got this room on Hotwire at a competitive price...so no complaints there. The hotel is conveniently located about 5 minutes from the airport which is a nice feature. After a long day of flying...we arrived at the hotel around 1130 PM. One would think this is a somewhat quiet and worry-free time to check into a room. Nothing could have been further from the truth on this occasion.I went in the hotel to check in and there was a line of three other folks. Not bad...problem was the line was not moving. I was told there was an issue with the computer system...wanting to check people into rooms that were already occupied. Not good...but just a minor problem that could be easily remedied by human interactions. Well that wasn't exactly what transpired...because even the human element was failing. Long story short...I had to wait at least another hour before being sent to a room. Meanwhile the kids were very tired...it was 1230am after all. Finally we were sent to a room...but alas our problem wasn't over because the room was being cleaned by housekeeping...and they just started. Well I wasn't about to wait another 30 minutes...so I called the front desk and they sent us to another room...where we were forced to wait another 5-10 minutes so somebody could give us new keys. By this time it was after 100am...and to say the kids were well past tired would be understated. On a good note at least the hotel compensated us by offering free parking (which is good since it will run you ~$20 per night). We were also offered free Wi-Fi access...but unfortunately this didn't work. That was OK, since we were too tired to enjoy much web surfing anyway. Another positive is the fitness facilities were top notch. Easily the best fitness equipment I have ever utilized in any hotel. On par with equipment found in my local gym. Overall this is a very nice looking facility and well worth the Hotwire price. Think we just caught them on a bad night...or so I would like to believe.

They serve wonderful appetizer food, desserts, and drinks. Although a little pricey, I wouldnt say it is too bad. The only negative aspect I would have to say would be parking, and wireless internet. Parking is quite expensive, at around $20 a day for self-park in their structure. And wireless internet was around $7-10 a day.

This hotel was recommended by a coworker because of the free airport shuttle although this hotel is located on a street with many hotels. This trip was my first to LA so I took the advice of my coworker plus this hotel is a \"preferred\" chain with my company. I was told the neighborhood was not good but it is OK. I wouldn't walk around at night but in the daytime, it seems OK as there is a lot of office buildings. There is a Taco Bell located across the street and further down the street is a McDonald's if you are interested. The hotel is nice overall. The rooms are OK. the bed was comfortable. Also no bedbugs that I could find. (I always check the beds for bedbugs. I lift the sheets and check all corners of the mattress.) The room was good enough for my purpose. I was suprised that the hotel was quiet. Being next to LAX, I was expecting the airplanes to keep me up but I did not heard anything. This is a plus. I have read about long lines and rude employees. I did check in around 10:00pm so no long lines. The employees were not rude at all. However, this hotel nickel and dimes you like crazy. If you are driving, parking is NOT free. WiFi is not free. If you want to use the computers in their business center, they are NOT free. I was shocked by this as most hotels do not charge you to use the computers in the business centers. This one does. I know WiFi is usually not free. For breakfast, they have a makeshift Starbucks. Most but not all coffees are available. NO caramel mocchiatto. But they had muffins, bagels, etc. Enough for a quick breakfast. I did eat at their restuarant/bar. Service was horrible. Food was OK but pricey.

After calling, we were then told that there were no rooms with a King or Queen-sized bed available due to a pipe-bursting problem. If the check-in staff had been more professional, we should have been notified of the hotel's problem and given options right away instead of having to discover it for ourselves. 3) One phone was broken, and Line 1 on the other phone was broken. The ethernet cable was missing. The room did not look well-kept. 4) Upon our request, we finally were moved to a different room with a double bed that looked more decent, although there was a seemingly open and used soap at the sink and the phone handset was not working the next morning.

I recently went up for a one-night trip with my children over the Christmas holiday to do some sight-seeing in L.A. We found a good rate on Hotwire ($78 plus tax was around $96 total). Parking (with in-and-out privileges) is $22.50/day. The first room we went into was filled with smoke, so we trekked back downstairs and were put in a room on one of the \"Starwood Preferred Guest\" floors, which didn't seem to be any different from the others. The clerk was very friendly and apologetic and I would say the service was good at the front desk. At another time, when I had lost my parking pass and needed a new one, the clerk was very helpful and then took a look at my kids and came back with two Westin Adventure Kids backpacks plus goodies inside. I felt they were trying to make our stay nice. The downside is that, while the hotel is close to LAX, it's in the neighborhood close to LAX. It's not someplace you'd want to walk around outside. Walking out front would be like walking on the side of a freeway. Also, the housekeeping was pretty poor. Our room had a noticeable layer of dust along the entire desk/dresser/minibar area and the bathrooms were very average, especially for something rated as a four-star hotel in Hotwire. The beds were comfortable, like other Westin beds, and the room was fairly quiet, but that may have been different if the hotel were more full. The hotel has a heated pool on the third floor. It's an average-sized pool and the water temperature is heated but not terribly warm. We went in in the evening, when it was in the 50s outside, and the pool felt pretty cool. The jacuzzi was much better, though you can't sit in the jacuzzi and watch your kids in the pool because there are steps and a wall between the two. So if your kids want to swim, be prepared to stay by the pool and save the jacuzzi time for later. The gym is currently being remodeled (as of December 2011). I didn't check out the temporary gym that they had in place. As far as location is concerned, as I mentioned it is minutes from LAX on Century Blvd. We used the hotel as a home base to do activities in Santa Monica. With L.A. traffic going either on the 405 or up the Pacific Coast Highway, it's about 30 minutes to Santa Monica. Having said all of this, my kids thought this was a WONDERFUL hotel. They say it's definitely a four-star hotel and one of the nicest they've been in. Don't they remember the stay at the Hyatt Regency in Maui? So, evidently, it made a great impression on them and hopefully that accounts for something. My tip would be to check Hotwire and try to get a good rate. At less that $100 a night, you'll feel it's a good value.", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cHotel is fine, but don't go in expecting \"Westin\"\u201d", "Author": "ChicagoToTheWorld", "ReviewID": "UR122575476", "Content": "I find that airport hotels are always a crapshoot - and quite frankly, this particular Westin does nothing to enhance the Westin image (is that image still excellent? - not really sure).

But while I was initially thrilled to be put in the Westin, I left thinking it was fine, but not up to Westin's name. Issues: The cold water faucet in the bathroom was loose and very difficult to turn off. An outlet on a lamp was mostly pulled out and not usable. Wallpaper pulling apart from the wall (and torn) in at least two locations in the room. Curtain was stained. The room was generally tired, dated, in bad need of an overhaul and the bathroom looked no better than one you'd find at most 3* airport hotels.

And dropping off a rental car is no more than a 10 minute drive away. Self parking is also fast and easy - and not that costly being that this is a major city.

This is considered the executive club level, again very excited. the excitement lasted only a few minutes. We were staying at this hotel for 5 nights, so we unpacked everything( we had also, done lots of shopping at the outlet mall and had bags and bags of stuff, un-packed all those). We entered the room and it was so old looking an the floor was so dirty. By 12:45 I go downstairs to ask if there is a place to get a coffee and the front desk told me that unfortunately there isn't any place available at this time! I go back to the room and start reading the booklets in the room, to my surprise , it says the bar downstair is open till 1:30 and has variety of speciality coffees!!! So i attempted to make coffee in the room, well, the coffee machine had water in it from the previous person, and it would shut off every 30 seconds, so it took me 4-5 attempts to make a cup of coffee. the top of coffee maker was so filthy and disgusting that I had to take a picture of! anyways, i could not get a decent coffee. Then, I went to brush my teeth and noticed the sink is clogged and there is a horrible smell coming from it.( remember, this room was supposed to be cleaned before we got there, not sure how the cleaning staff cleaned there and did not open the water in sink!!). I called the service express and they sent their engineer to check on it. it is already 1:30 in the morning!!! Sonny the engineer comes up( such a great guy) and spent another almost 2 hours in our bathroom. I had to stay up for this whole time, at the end he said it is not fixable and we have to switch rooms,by this time the horrible smell is all over our room, you could hardly breath!b He asked us not to use the sink either, My husband had already fallen asleep so I called the front desk and made them aware of the situation. I told them that we will be changing our room in the morning since my husband is asleep. She said she will call me in the morning to tell me which room is assigned to us.I set the alarm at 7:30 so I can pack everything again and be ready for our 8:30 room change. I got up, packed and went to take a shower , believe it pr not, my body touched the shower curtain and there is a huge nose mucus( BOOGIE!). I almost threw up! anyways, got out of shower as soon as I could, since the water was so cold too! anyways, no one calls until a little pass 8:30 I call the front desk to ask about the room number, well, they had no idea what I was talking about! finally, they said after 12 pm they will have a room on the 12th floor, we packed everything and left for universal. Came back at 11 pm and they had given us a room on the 11th floor. By then I am furious at everything with the hotel. To compensate for all these, they had given us a suite with a terrace but to get to the room, it took you a while to get from the elevator to your room as the room was at the end of a connecting hallway. also, what am I gonna do with a terrace by the airport in December? So I go downstairs and wait in the preferred line to be served! with no one in front of me, it took them 20 minutes to serve me,actually they didn't. I just walked in front of the other line waiting to be checked in. The guy was so rude an arrogant that I had to ask for the night manager, I explained to her what had happened and she was very nice and understanding. At the end, we were given free internet and free valet parking for our whole stay( we had already started using both accepting the charges). Also, there is a coffee stand in the lobby, the only place that serves Starbucks coffee. you go there at 10 am and she says she is closed!!! Also, in the booklet in the room was a list for complimentary things you could ask. I asked for hair spray and a sewing kit and they didn't have either one. also , the cleaning lady did not clean the bathroom floor or any other floor for that matter. I guess they don't vacuum everyday. Just make your bed and put new soap and shampoo! In this trip I stayed at 2 other hotels and they both were amazing( hilton La Jolla San Diego and Hotel Nikko San Francisco union square). This by far was the worst hotel I had every stayed at.

Despite mixed reviews on this site, this is a definite Westin hotel, with a grand, stylish lobby and all the requisite professionalism and all the trimmings, plus surprising friendliness. I am aware of several comments about nicked furniture, cramped bathrooms, worn carpets, etc., but am also aware that most of those comments came from people who used budget websites, which result in less desirable rooms on lower when the hotel is crowded. I hedged my bet by taking advantage of Westin\u2019s offer to upgrade to concierge level, even though I am regular SPG member. The offer (not available for reservations on alternate websites) cost $25 per night, a bit steep for a stay that would have been otherwise free -- until I considered the cost of Internet use ($15- plus for the deluxe, fastest service) and breakfast ($30). For concierge level, a decent breakfast is offered weekdays in the plush club-level lounge and weekends at the Starbucks Kiosk. Also, those costly bottles of water people always complain about are free; you can even ask for more. That also may be one reason my room was plush, stylish and pristine. I can only imagine some over-entitled guests expecting haute retro-70s trendiness or some Queen Anne movie set, but this was a solid, contemporary four-star accommodation, replete with a 42-inch flat screen TV (with hi-def reception and movies), three phones, a safe, nice-sized bath, a comfortable fold-out couch, comfy bathrobes (regularly replaced) and a super-king bed and plush linens usually found in five-star hotels (and turned down at evenings with chocolate mints on the pillows). The Internet worked like a charm, faster than at my home. The breakfast and evening appetizers at the club lounge were top quality, too. Ample, well displayed fruit, vegetables, pastries, breads, succulent wings and fluffy scrambled eggs, plus top-line coffees, teas, juices and full cash bar services. The dining tables were always cleaned, and even the club computers were top line. The weather seemed to be in the low 70s and cloudless on the three early December days of my stay, sot it was great to savor the pool scene on the third floor, decked out with big palm trees and luxurious lounge chairs. The jacuzzi never worked, which I hear is a common problem, and the workout room is temporarily on the lobby level, which can be inconvenient, but for an airport hotel, this pool scene was a nice surprise. Also a surprise is the hotel restaurant, part of a respected local chain of brasseries with succulent specialities. Even the hotel gift shop seemed more like a resort style emporium than the basic snack-and-toiletry huts in many airport hotels. Of course the best attribute of the Westin Los Angeles Airport is the shuttle. Yes, it\u2019s shared with one or two other hotels, but that insures prompt regular service -- which seem to be the entire theme of my all too brief stay.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Hartford, CT", "Title": "\u201cA great stay near the airport\u201d", "Author": "CT_Alison", "ReviewID": "UR121937578", "Content": "We stayed here 1 night because we had to catch a 7:45 AM flight.

I was able to fall asleep without thinking about the air traffic noise from the airport. I chose a king size bed room and the room was equipped with a large LCD TV and a small couch/loveseat. The couch was surprising comfortable as most hotel couches I sit on are usually not. The room also had a weighted mini-fridge and a weighted tray with products for purchase. There is a single-serve coffee maker with Starbucks coffee on the counter also. I did not use the hotel\u2019s facilities at all. I know there was a gym and a restaurant on site but I did not visit either. The hotel also has a parking structure attached and it was easy to drive in and out of to get to the airport and other places near the hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly when I checked in and also when I checked out. Although the hotel itself does not look new or fresh, it was clean.

Prior to the Westin, I stayed at the Marriott LAX, but it slid downhill in the late 90s. From the worn drapes to the scratches on the walls, this is one tired puppy. The electric plugs are dusty - waaaay dusty, as if they haven't been cleaned in a long time. Old, low quality carpet. Motel 6-type plastic cups complete the downscale experience. This is a Westin? In name only. Mattresses ARE comfortable, and the AC worked well. The dining room food is \"eh\". Some guests are charged $12.99 a night for the rather slow Internet Overall, on a scale of 1 to 10, this limps in as a rather weak 4. Bottom line, I wouldn't stay ANYWHERE in the LAX area unless I was dead tired, and/or needed a close-to-LAX location to grab a flight. It's a sad area without decent restaurants or any tourist attractions.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cWhat I expected and very quiet.\u201d", "Author": "Planelivin", "ReviewID": "UR120991179", "Content": "Excellent location but then it's an airport hotel so hard to mess that up.

Be prepared for a bit of a walk to your room. NEIGHBORHOOD: Not much here, although there is some sort of a cafe with internet access on the same block. Hotel is about a 3-minute drive from LAX. ROOM: The furniture was clearly a few years old. However, it was in good enough shape, and everything felt clean. The \"Heavenly Bed\" featured at Westin properties is truly amazing. The flat-screen HDTV is huge. I stayed on the fifth floor, and didn't notice too much noise coming from outside the room (but I am admittedly a heavy sleeper). This hotel does have a lot of extra charges, so be careful. The bottled water in the room costs $4.50. If you move items in the minibar to make room for your own things, they charge a $25 restocking fee. Internet access is around $13 per day. In-room movies can cost upwards of $16 each. One nice thing is that they have computers in the lobby from which you can print an airline boarding pass for free.

Sadly, it has suffered a steep decline in customer service. I would not recommend this hotel for people wanting uninterrupted sleep, or for visitors to LA looking for humane treatment after a long flight. Stay somewhere else. Starwood Preferred? I wouldn't recommend it for you, dear member, either. I arrived at midnight, tired, after a long-delayed flight. As a member, I automatically just lined up in that line, only to be completely ignored by the desk clerk. The desk clerk kept taking guests from the other line, presumably because the \"Preferred\" clerk was off having a tea-break. Eventually, the Preferred clerk arrived back, and motioned me forward. No \"hello\", no \"nice to see you, just a bored, unfriendly \"name?\". Then he couldn't find my reservation. He sighed, went and got the night manager, and both of them stood there for the next several minutes slowly scrolling their way through the system - at midnight. Hello... person needing to sleep here... Eventually they found half of my booking, but had trouble reconciling the two nights, presumably because they were prepaid using points. After a dozen more minutes they got that sorted out - then put me in a room with two single beds. So we started over. After a half hour more delay, they finally sent me to an incredibly noisy room that faced the runway - exactly the type of room I had requested that they not put me in. By then, even I was too tired to care, so I turned in. Then around one a.m., a party started in the room next door (warning to guests: the Westin has very thin walls). I called down but no one called or came up or did anything to stop the noise, so after fifteen minutes, I knocked on the door myself and the guests were kind enough to stop. Roll on to this morning - despite my placing a \"Do Not Disturb\" sign on the door, a Westin day manager with a clipboard knocked on my door and woke me up to tell me that it was \"time for me to check out.\" I told him I was booked for two nights and was desperately trying to get some sleep. Sorry, but you need to check out, he said. No, I don't, I replied. Please check. After a little more prodding, he checked. Oh, you're right. He then apologized (the only manager that apologized for anything during this entire stay) - but by that time I was awake. Roll on to the evening. I'm dead tired by now and have just fallen asleep when the Duty Manager (a man who would perhaps be better suited to working at a morgue than in live customer service) wakes me up to tell me that my credit card has been declined and he needs another card. I told him that is not possible because it is a Gold Amex, and completely up to date, and asked him to retry it, but he refused to. So I offered to give him another card over the phone. He said no, you can't do this over the phone, we need to have the physical card to swipe. I said, look, the rooms are prepaid, the card you have is fine, I'm sleeping, if you need another card for the incidentals, I'll give it to you in the morning. He gets testy and responds by saying if you don't provide me with the card, you can't continue to stay in the hotel. Say what? I remind him that I've prepaid for my two nights (the card is being used for incidentals only.) He says it doesn't matter - he needs to swipe the card, or I can't stay - even though I've pre-paid for the room! At this point, I'm getting annoyed. I've paid for the room with points earned from hundreds of stays at Starwood properties. And this is the third time I've been deprived of sleep in less than 24 hours at the Westin LAX, and I'm exhausted. I call Amex. They confirm my card is 100% fine - the hotel made an error while entering the credit card date - they entered 11 instead of 14. I ask them to hold, get dressed, go down to the lobby and ask for the manager. I put him on the phone with Amex. Amex confirms to him that the hotel made a mistake. The rooms are fully paid for (and had been all along). The incidentals will be covered, if he just enters the date correctly. We hang up. I ask the manager for an apology. He refuses. He says instead that if I don't like the service, I can leave. At this point, I'm stunned. And beyond tired, and really frustrated. I can't believe the level of tone-deafness on display. The guy shows no understanding of the concept that the primary reason that anyone needs a hotel room is because they want to sleep. I don't know who to feel more sorry for - myself, future weary travelers, or Starwood shareholders. Anyway, sorry for the long rant, but that's what these reviews are for - sharing. Speaking of which, I am now writing this from the Hilton LAX, where the people were nice on check in and treated me like a fellow human being (thank you!) I'd forgotten how nice the Hilton LAX is. Now that I'm back, I would strongly suggest that visitors to the LA Airport area stay here instead of the Westin - it's usually around the same price, but closer to the airport, the amenities are similar, the food is better, but most importantly, it appears to be staffed by caring humans. As for the Westin LAX, unless you enjoy being treated like the meat in a sausage machine by uncaring duty managers, and constantly deprived of sleep, you may want to avoid it.

It was more like a mist. 2) The wifi - for $12.95/day no less - is slow to non-existent in the rooms and possibly even the lobby. I'm talking minutes to download a simple email, and lots of timeouts.

(The staff did remove it from my bill when I asked them to.) 3) My bill showed bogus charges - for the in-room food, which I didn't use; and 2 extra charges for wifi. The desk clerk removed the charges but they shouldn't have been there. Check your bill. Also check the 'offers' page of the hotel's website - not the main Westin site, but the Westin LAX site.

He said that since my room faced the street and not the airport side that it should be quieter, but I can hear all the street noise. This hotel needs to better sound proof their rooms. Also as others mentioned, it doesn't have the heavenly shower that most people look forward to in a Westin!

I had a strange experience with the room rate: I knew from checking Westin's website beforehand that rooms were available and what the rate should be, but my trip was last minute so I didn't bother to make a reservation, figuring I could just walk in. To my surprise, the front desk quoted me a price much higher than what I saw on Westin's website earlier that day. I told them their own website quoted a lower rate and they told me walk-in rates are always higher and they couldn't give me the website rate.

We got one cheap last minute, but could have easily taken the city transport... one night took the free trolly that picked up at the hotel and went to Manhatten beach. Warning if you have a vehicle, daily parking is pricy ($20) and varies by season (we overheard) something to consider. The hotel pool is average-small. The hot tub (something we were looking forward to after walking all day) was TINY, only fits 4 people w/o touching knees with strangers...not really a problem for us as this is a VERY business friendly hotel and both nights we were the only people using it, no one at the pool either). The well stocked gym however was packed in the evenings. The room over looked the airport and was surprisingly quiet. I am a light sleeper and bring headphones at times to cancel out noise, but did not need them, windows are well insulated. Did notice lots of flight attendants and stewardesses coming and going all night (I stay up late...) The food in the restaurant is very delicious and you pay for it, but its really good. I highly recommend the Bacon Mac n Cheese... sounds tacky right? Wrong, award winning stuff with applewood smoked bacon and sauteed mushrooms. Note: bar menu has a nicely priced happy hour with food and drink specials. The room is a little tight, but well appointed with modern decor (be mindful of the fridge, just moving an item to put in my personal water bottle incured a charge, however they did remove it when I complained... there were additional charges the next day when I stored some medicine in there...again removed, glad I checked the bill). Lastly (the reason for writing this review) the beds. Fantastic. The duvet is washed as is the linen (pima cotton) between guests, and is spotless white. Looks, feels and smells fresh. But the comfort is beyond compare. They sell all their bedding and even the insanely dreamy matress & pillows at outrageous prices, (there is a website dedicated for this) and it's probably worth every penny, I just don't have a lot of pennies these days..

The hotel said it was a scheduled maintenance, but other guests who stay there often said it's been out of service for quite some time. The pool smelled disgusting as well. My 12 year old refused to go in the water, saying it smelled like pee. We left after one night, vacations are too short to spend in places like this.

The biggest problem that I had with this hotel was upon checkout. There was no bill underneath my door in the morning, so I waited in line at the front desk to check out. When presented with the bill, I noticed that I had been charged for a rollaway bed for four days, totaling about $85, when in fact I did not have a rollaway in the room at all. It delayed my checkout for a few more minutes while the employee went to a back room to try to resolve the issue. Ultimately, they did remove that charge. My concern is that had I not taken the time to review the charges, they would have overcharged me by $85. Too often, people presume that hotels get everything right, when they don't.

My Friday stay was fine as I had gotten in late...thank goodness I was SPG Gold as the regular line had 20 people waiting at 10pm at night with only 2 agents to serve them all. The SPG line went fast and my SPG gold status was acknowledged and I was given a room on the top Exec floor. The parking garage is a little funky but overall it was convenient, and the beds are great. On my return Weds, I arrived at the hotel at 2pm (6am flight next day) and I was not feeling well. The lobby was nearly empty (except for construction going on) and I got a front-desk agent with no compassion. She said she had no rooms available and I would need to wait until check-in time. She called housekeeping and asked to push a room up in the priority list, but ultimately I had to go check back and keep checking before finally be given a room on the 9th floor 45 mins later. I was not happy at all by this point and had been put on a non-preferred floor without my normal 15th floor access. I called the desk and they told me I had access as a Gold member, but I didnt and they offered to send Security which I told them made no sense. Later that evening I decided to return the rental car and take the shuttle back from the airport (MISTAKE). I ended up waiting over an hour to get a shuttle that wasn't full and returned to the hotel at 10:30pm after dropping the car at 8:45. I called the desk and told the manager on duty I was highly disappointed with the service, the fact that anytime I called the desk the phone rang 25x before someone picked up, and with the lack of service overall. I also left a message for the GM who did not contact me back. Overall the Weds night stay was very subpar, I felt poor service and poor staffing in the hotel, and I will not return to this location again. Note as well the first night the front desk clerk didn't know where \"in and out burger\" was, a very popular LA fast food choice close to the hotel. He suggested I consider walking to McDonalds and ultimately sent me to the concierge to get more info. Overall very disappointed with this location as compared to other Westin's I have stayed in and I will not recommend or be back in this location.

My only complaint is that the free shuttle from the airport takes FOREVER. I swear the other hotel shuttles came by 4x before ours did. Still, the ride to/from isn't long, so it's convenient for an overnight stay. It's not SO convenient though to food or anything else, so beware of that.

This was my first time to travel out to LA with my young children and the staff at the Westin Hotel did a great job making my boys feel welcomed. Since I was traveling with two young boys, I thought it would be great to have a view of the planes taking off and landing outside of the hotel window. I specifically requested a high floor with a view of the airport and that is what I received. I will say that being so close to the airport and in line with the flight path, one would think that the jet engine noise would prevent a great night's rest, well I was wrong. The rooms are insulated very well from the noise, so you would see planes landing, but you could barely hear them, which was great for my wife and I. I would recommend this hotel to everyone.

Despite the proximity to the airport we found airplane noise was not a problem although there was a good view of them approaching.

The only problem with hotels on the LAX site, is the lack of alternatives for eating and drinking \u2013 and as a result of this, lack of competition, which means prices are fairly high. With some searching, alternative bars and eating houses can be found which offer decent fare at reasonable prices \u2013 but they are not, at first, obvious without a bit of exploring.

The beds are very com fortable with high quality bedding and pillows. The foyer is nice and the pool though small is clean and very sheltered with nice sun loungers around it. Breakfast is fine though there is a limited selection of hot foods. Restaurant and bar staff are helpful and friendly. The restaurant manager was very good at sorting out a problem we had. The negatives - after day 2 we were part f a very large conference so sadly we were subjected to mass catering which was very limited. The waiting time at reception is far too long and I had the awful experience of being locked out of my room because the hotel has failed to ask for a credit car swipe at check in. I was only told this when I asked why my room key no longer worked. This is very poor customer care. The other area which needs improvement is the standard of room cleaning and service each day. Basically the beds were made but apart from that there was little or no evidence of staff having been in. I feel the hotel is pretty good but could be very much better with improved staff training and tighter overall management. The other thing I objected to was a charge of 16 dollars per day for internet access. For my ten days this would have been 160 dollars which is ridiculous. Overall its fine and if you just want an average hotel close to the airport go for it.

Very friendly and accommodating. However, because I was absent minded- one employee stood out. The following is a letter I sent to the General Manager at the Westin: On April 1, 2011, my husband and I had the pleasure of meeting Dora in the Gift Shop. She was professional, friendly, and considerate. She approached us immediately when we came into the door to see if she could help us make a purchase. The next day, I went back to the gift shop to purchase a jacket that Dora had shown me. She was not there so I purchased it from the gentleman who was attending the gift shop. After learning that the jacket was too small, I took it back the next day. Dora helped me chose a jacket that was just a little larger. At that time I left my billfold at the register, but did not realize it was gone until many hours later. Since I remembered the last time I used my billfold was in the gift shop, I was certain it was safe with Dora. When I went to check on it, Dora told me that she had called my room and when she couldn\u2019t get in touch with me she gave it to security. After my meeting that evening I contacted security, who met me at the front desk and gave it to me. You must be very proud of Dora and your security officer. From my conversations with Dora, I knew she was very trustworthy. This could have been a very unsettling circumstance and her actions caused me to have little concern.

Frankly, after reading the recent good reviews, it's hard to believe we're talking about the same place! When I got to my room, it looked okay, but as I looked closer, I noticed the furniture was pretty dated (mid-80s?) and beat-up. The office chair was ripped , like a wolf had attacked it, there was a sizable gouge on the wall. and the veneer on the furniture was warped and peeling in areas. The desk lamp's finish was very worn, and there were big dents in the bedside lampshade. The worst was when I drew the curtains for privacy - they were terribly stained! I took pictures of this, but have refrained from posting them because frankly it would be beyond the limits of good taste. Yes, it is that bad - let your imagination wander on this one. If you really want to see, I can email the pictures to you. In that corner of the room, the wall lamp was hanging halfway off the wall, and the aforementioned gouge was also present. It seemed something had \"happened\" in this corner - I felt very creeped out. I called reception and requested another room - this was done quickly and pleasantly. The staff was very nice - no problems there. The new room was much better (the curtains were clean) but there were still chips on the furniture, and the bathtub had an old imprint of anti-slip adhesive (as did the bathtub in the previous room). This I would expect from a dumpy roadside motel, but from a Westin? There were also several black hairs in plain sight on the bathroom counter. As a previous housekeeper, I can't understand how this could be - a clean bathroom counter is a basic! The rest of the bathroom was clean, although the grout in most of the lower shower area was discoloured - a simple bleach treatment or scrub with Comet could solve this unsightly problem. Interestingly, there was a floor lamp in addition to the wall lamp in the corner of the new room, which furthered my suspicions that something had happened in the previous room - I wonder what happened to the floor lamp there? The only thing that seemed to be new was the carpet. The bed linens were nice - two fluffy duvets and thick cotton sheets. Another minus: I knew that internet access in the room would be $12.95, which I was willing to pay. However, $12.95 will only get you \"internet lite\", which is evidentially enough for emailing and web browsing. For anything above that (streaming video, online games etc.) it is a whopping $16.95. I went ahead and paid it, but only was able to view one email before the thing decided to stop working. Or rather, I was still connected, but the signal was too poor to do anything with! At this point, Iit was very late, and I had a crushing headache, and decided to just go to bed, and just ask for a refund for the internet in the morning. (and the signal was still was extremely weak in the morning) Plane noise is high if you are facing the pool (which also faces a corner of the airport). I could hear it even through my earplugs. The situation is probably better on the other side of the building - but there doesn't seem to be much soundproofing going on here. I stayed at the La Quinta across the street last time, and don't recall plane noise being a problem there. I don't expect complete silence at an airport location, but really it was loud. Also, a note on restaurant options: they do have a restaurant (Dailly Grill) on site, but it's the only one, and it's expensive - $19 for a hamburger, and $5.50 for a glass of orange juice. I walked down the street to the Subway - there's also a Taco Bell, Carl's Jr and McDonalds in that same area. So there's no other option that I could see - it's fast food or the pricey restaurant. My friend who is a local, says the restaurant is excellent, so I'm sure it's worth it. But just be forewarned if you don't want to spend a lot of money on food, it's limited in that area. Aside from the above dramas, the decor is very depressing - muted olive green, brown and grey. The guest lobby is especially bad - the lighting made me feel like I was in an inner-city bus station. Really depressing atmosphere in that lobby! Perhaps it's better during the daylight hours? I feel sorry for the nice staff, because they were great.

First we were late to the airport. We were already through security when the ticket agent told our friends they were too late to board. However a sympathetic gate clerk did let them board to join us. Then, our first layover was very short. We literally ran through two terminals and a train ride to make our connection. Finally, at LAX we had plenty of time, but when attempting to board, the gate clerk discovered that we had inadvertently brought our expired passports. We were disallowed boarding! Our friends continued on while we had 24 hours to kill while waiting for the correct passports from home. Not wanting to sleep on the floor at LAX we asked several employees of our airline where they recommended we stay. There are many hotels near the Los Angeles Airport but the clear consensus was the Westin. The agent for \"first class\" check in told us that when she didn't care to make the LA commute after a late shift, she went to the Westin \"because of the beds\". She even called the hotel and made our reservation. Catching the shuttle (very convenient) we were at the Westin in less than ten minutes. Check in was seamless in a lobby that is large enough for most people's houses to fit inside. This is definitely a \"Grand Hotel\". Taking what possibly are the quickest elevators in the industry, we were whisked to our eighth floor room overlooking the pool and fitness area. All the expected amenities were in place (a \"real\" hairdryer for instance) and the bed, the bed was perfect. The comforter was as soft and fluffy as I have seen and just the perfect weight. The mattress too, was perfect. Not too soft, not too hard. Even with the soft rumble of the jets departing LAX, we dropped of to restful slumber in moments. However before we retired, there were several interactions with the staff (at the Westin) that were extremely pleasant and cordial. The lady in the gift shop, when not having a small mirror, (I forgot mine) offered to give me hers from her purse \"I never use it\" she said. And the bar in the lobby is very, very nice. After the day we had had, a cocktail seemed in order. As fate would have it, we arrived at the beginning of \"happy hour\" and took immediate advantage of the offerings. We were intending to have dinner in the \"Daily Grill\" restaurant, just off the lobby (looks so inviting) however this night the \"Oscars\" were showing and since there were no TV's in the restaurant, the extremely pleasant bartender showed us a tempting \"bar menu\". As a consequence, we enjoyed a tasty, well prepared meal while watching the awards (they were occurring just 30 minutes away). We then toasted ourselves to a great evening, a great hotel and the misfortune that turned into a vacation within a vacation.

She remembered being pregnant and understood that after a long road trip, at eight months of pregnancy, a king size bed with a full sized tub was absolutely necessary.

She made us feel that if she had to personally go clean an empty room with a king bed, she would have done it.

They've renovated the main common areas, which is quite nice, but there's nothing here that makes this a must-see hotel. The airport shuttle to and from LAX is quick and convenient. The Westin is at the end of the shuttle route, which is also served by a couple of other hotels such as an Holiday Inn and La Quinta. This makes it a bit more challenging if you're late for your flight, or if you have a lot of luggage, but is manageable. The rooms were unremarkable. The bed and bathroom were acceptable, but there is nothing that I can say about the rooms, good or bad. I think that they are getting around renovating their rooms fully to the Westin brand standard. There is still work to be done. My room faced away from Century Boulevard, which actually faces the runways, and is also near a dog pound, with a lot of barking. Parking in the LAX area is expensive. The Westin doesn't help here. If you're with Fox Car rental or Thrifty, you can slightly get around this by picking up your vehicle late and turning it in early in your trip, because their rental locations are just a 60-second walk away. (You can probably pull this off with all the agencies, but it means transferring bus shuttles at LAX. For daytime parking, Fox has a parking lot off Glasgow Place that is much cheaper than the Westin's. Irrespectively, you'll be paying notably for parking if you stay at the Westin LAX. All in all, there are dozens of hotels in the LAX area.

That's about it for its positives. It would be a reasonable choice for an unexpected stay in LA due to a cancelled flight or similar. As always with Westin's heavenly bed, the bed and linens are among the best of any 4/5 star hotel. My spouse and I stayed over at this Westin for Saturday and Sunday nights while traveling on business between San Francisco and Huntington Beach. In hindsight, we should have stayed at the Hilton Checkers downtown (which we love from a 3 night stay in 2010), or onto Huntington Beach where we had reservations at a wonderful boutique hotel. If you plan to do anything beyond an overnight layover at LAX, I would avoid this location. Starwood may have allowed this Westin operate past its shelf life. Most aspects of the hotel look worn and tired - a renovation would be a good idea. The bathroom details are noticeably dirty or corroded. The desk chair had seen better days. The outlets were a spider's web of surge protectors. One of the two phones in the room didn't work. A shower at 1am means having to wait 15+ minutes for hot water to flow. More importantly, the hotel management doesn't appear to have a handle on effective leadership of the staff. The front desk were perpetually understaffed both prior and during my stay. I had to phone the front desk three times just to get through. We gave up on visiting the desk at checkout. Even with SPG Gold status, checkout would have been 30+ minutes. And this location didn't offer a kiosk option for checkout. We returned home just before 1am to learn the hotel had scheduled a 2 hour power outage. We had fun stumbling through the room in the dark. The valet/bellhop staff are particularly lackluster. Bellhops will stand around while you unload the car yourself, then have the audacity to ask to help on the way to the elevator bank. You have to walk up to the valet desk to get help - don't expect them to walk over to you. One morning I visited the sundry shop to buy a container of whole milk for my toddler. We would have purchased milk the night prior, but, the hotel couldn't provide a refrigerator for the room. There is a stern warning not to store personal items in the minibar fridge. So, I figured I would get some in the morning. The sundry shop didn't sell milk, but, very kindly recommended the hotel's restaurant. The restaurant hostess was nice about helping out with this request. It was a little surprising to be charged $2.74 for 6oz of milk for a baby. This has always been my gripe with Westin's and W's - everything is for a fee. I'm a Diamond with Hilton and highly doubt a Hilton property would have taken the time to charge for something as small as 6oz of milk for a baby's bottle. Even a Starwood Aloft or Elements property would not have charged for this. I can appreciate that the hostess is probably compelled by policy to charge. The fault is really her management on failing to empower staff to make small gestures of hospitality. We had a great time in LA for two nights, but, that wasn't really to the credit of the Westin at LAX. I would not recommend this hotel until its renovated and staffed under new management.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cSlipped in Quality\u201d", "Author": "brmusicman", "ReviewID": "UR97547323", "Content": "I had previously written a review of this hotel in which I described it as the best of the LAX options I'd tried. In that review, I noted that was probably more of a negative statement about the other LAX hotels than a positive statement about this hotel, although I noted some of the hotel's positive aspects. Unfortunately, I stayed at this hotel again on a LAX layover in 2011, and it appeared that the quality had really slipped; I don't think I'll be headed back. A few problems: Some major problems: 1. My room was dirty. Dirty carpet, a visibly dirt-laden showerhead, crumbs in the corner, etc. Gross. 2. My room was in serious need of renovation. The curtains were ripped, the pictures were hung astray, the bathroom was tired (yellowed light fixtures, etc.), the carpet was worn, the brochures (stacked in a corner area of the desk) were out-of-date and stained with room service food, etc., the lampshades were torn, etc. It just looked TIRED and, more than that, it also indicated poor maintenance. You shouldn't wait for the next major renovation to replace a torn lampshade or ripped curtain. Just fix it! This all, of course, didn't make the room look any cleaner. 3. Some irritating service issues. When I asked about late checkout at check-in, I got tons of attitude about it from the clerk. I understand that a busy airport hotel cannot always meet a late check-out request, but there is no need to give the guest a bunch of attitude for asking if it's possible. Later, after check-out (which I couldn't extend), I needed a land-line phone in order to set-up an international cell phone. Even though the call was toll-free and needed to be no longer than 2 minutes, the original front desk clerk refused to let me use a phone, sending me to a house phone placed in an abandoned bank of pay phones. The person who answered the house phone refused to give me an outside line. This required going back to the desk and then getting management approval to use a telephone (including waiting a few minutes for said manager to appear). Come on -- the front desk clerk can't just send me to a phone near the corner of the desk for 2 minutes?!? Ugh -- a clear sign of a hotel that hasn't empowered it's staff to help customers. Some minor frustrations: 1. I wasn't assigned to the room type I reserved. My confirmation clearly stated that I had reserved a room with one king bed; I was assigned a room with 2 double beds. 2. Despite having gold status with Starwood, my room preferences were not honored by the hotel. In addition to being assigned the wrong room, I was put in a room on a low floor directly by the elevators when my profile calls for exactly the opposite. 3. The shuttle situation is chaotic. The hotel shares a shuttle with two other properties, and by the time the shuttle reached my terminal, there wasn't room for additional passengers. Bags were everywhere, people were crammed into it, etc. -- hardly the situation you want to have to deal with after a very long flight. Note that many of the LAX hotels share shuttles to be friendlier to the environment, so perhaps this isn't a Westin-exclusive issue, but I've not had the overcrowding be an issue with other LAX properties to the extent it was with this one. Yuck. This place is in need of a serious overhaul -- bring on the renovation and some new customer-service training to go with it.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Washington DC, District of Columbia", "Title": "\u201cGreat Service from Natasha\u201d", "Author": "sdj229", "ReviewID": "UR97023202", "Content": "Great hotel for the cost.

A lot of tour groups seem to stay here. During our last visit, it was Chinese tourists, this time it was Australians, all of whom seemed to have restaurant vouchers. A lot of airline crew members also stay here--they have a separate check-in line, as do Starwood Gold members. These separate lines were not always staffed--while our check-in was quick (but perfunctory), check-out was terribly slow because of this. The hotel is not the closest to the airport, but there is a free shuttle that takes about 15 minutes. For tourists, there is not much to do in the immediate vicinity, but the hotel is in a decent enough location to serve as a home base. The room was nice, large enough for a king bed and pull-out sofa. The bathroom was smaller than that on our last visit. We asked for and received a room facing Century Blvd. (the hotel's front) and heard no airplane noise. I think the runway is to the rear of the hotel. The console that houses the desk, dresser, minibar and TV is nicely designed. The hotel's lobby is spacious. There are many public function rooms and at least 2 ballrooms--there were 3 functions going on simultaneously while we were there. There is a business center with computers (for a fee), plus a few other computers in other locations. Starwood VIP's have a private lounge and computer that seemed to never be staffed. The pool area is small but nicely done, although the jacuzzi was in repair. There is no spa. The pre-arrival and post-stay/survey emails sent by Westin were a nice touch. And then there's the Daily Grill, a restaurant chain serving classic American chophouse fare of high quality that we have always been fond of. Apparently the restaurant here was not always a Daily Grill, and there is a vacant dining space adjacent to it. Besides the lounge that has a small food menu, the Daily Grill is it. Dining options within walking distance are all fast food. For our brief stay we had 3 meals here--late lunch, late supper and breakfast. The Grill also does the hotel's room service, although that menu is not as complete as the restaurant's, and the prices are higher. The restaurant does take-out, so if you want to eat in your room during restaurant hours, this is the more economical option, and what we did for supper. During high occupancy times, they do a breakfast buffet, which we did. It didn't have the widest selections, but was fine.

I have also stayed at the Hilton LAX one block down the road and it\u2019s fantastic. The problem with this hotel is the service or lack of service. When checking in the girl behind the counter was more interested in ordering her dinner. She was complaining that she never got dinner etc. That is not my problem!! I asked her if the room was facing the airport runway. She didn\u2019t know and had to look at a hotel map. She was rude and I got the sense that I was bothering her with my request. I also asked for a late checkout. She was unable to offer my request. Strange since this is my fourth Starwood stay this month. The rooms are really old. You can see this by the popcorn on the ceiling. I would have to say late 70\u2019s or 80\u2019s. Not Westin standard. I also noticed a lot of dust in the room. The best was clean and confortable. That is very important. I also got help to my room from the bellboy. Something at this hotel is working correctly. Then again I tipped him $5. He was excellent. I should of got his name. Looking at the room service menu it was boing and overpriced. Guess if you want a $20 burger it might work. I used yelp to find a restaurant. I found Ayara Thai. Based on the reviews and menu, Ayara Thai looked really good so I decided to give it a try. I wasn\u2019t disappointed. The food took 15 minutes and by the time I arrived at the restaurant to pick up my food it was ready. There is plenty of parking outside and the staffs are friendly. I asked for extra napkins and plastic cutlery which they gladly provided. I ordered the yellow chicken curry and beef curry. Both came with rice. The yellow chicken curry was a little spicy which I love. This was a perfect meal. I was so happy with my choice and also happy I didn\u2019t order room service or use the expensive hotel restaurant. I won\u2019t stay here again. When checking out there was only one person working behind the counter. I dropped my card in the express checkout box and left.

And that's where the fairy tale ends because that's when we arrived at ::The Westin Los Angeles Airport:: (cue menacing music). OK...I'm being overly dramatic. That's what Tinseltown does to you. While this wasn't the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, it definitely was the worst *Westin* I've ever stayed in. Starwood Properties really needs to take a closer look at this property to bring it up to the usual excellent standard I've come to know, love and EXPECT (yes, I broke your non-caps rule Tripadvisor...it was *necessary* to bust out the caps-lock). Westins are usually awesome. Great service, clean, fluffy beds, excellent showers...you get the idea. This so-called Westin - not so much. The bed was great and the food was too, but everything else just blew. (rhymes!) I'll start at the beginning, a couple weeks before my stay. I booked the room through the Starwood website (i.e., not via a discounted travel site) for the very excellent rate of $84.00 per night. Wow! For a Westin! I was stoked and told my colleagues, who would be joining me in L.A. on Sunday night (11/21) for a quota-making sales presentation early on Monday morning, about this fantastic rate at a !!Westin!!. They were stoked as well since they were also accustomed to better-than-average, but still economical business hotels and considered Westins to be a part of this shrinking demographic. That\u2019s when the \u201cif it sounds too good to be true, then it probably is\u201d saying started circling in my brain like vultures targeting roadkill. So, off to tripadvisor.com I went. I did not like what I had to read. I stopped after the third page of \u201cCrikeys, don\u2019t ever stay at this hotel mate!\u201d (or something similar in non-Aussie language). I was now quite dismayed that I had booked myself and my colleagues at a noisy, dirty, poorly serviced and shabby hotel so I wrote to their director of operations, Matthew Morgan, and relayed my concerns to him. He replied that my concerns were for naught since they were ranked #43 out of 289 hotels in the area and that they had a 68% rating on Tripadvisor. He also wrote, \u201cI will personally oversee your accommodations as our VIP guests to ensure you have a great experience and are happy for choosing Westin for your trip!\u201d. Well, that didn\u2019t happen. I arrived at the hotel around 9 pm on Sunday night. Self-parking is very easy to start, but the ticket and pay system is a nightmare. If you are self-parking, ALWAYS bring your ticket to the front desk or you\u2019ll pay $21 every time you take your car out (no attendant). Next, to the front desk and in to the Starwood Preferred Guest line. It wasn\u2019t busy in the least and there were only a couple of gentlemen ahead of me and they were already talking with the desk clerk. After waiting about 5 minutes, it became clear that these guys weren\u2019t checking in or out\u2026they were discussing hot nightclubs to go to in downtown L.A. Isn\u2019t that what a concierge is for? And couldn\u2019t desk clerk see that I was waiting to check in and called one of his colleagues over to help me since they were just standing around anyway? Apparently not because I ended up waiting about 10 minutes for these guys to finish up. Finally got checked in and got to my room on the 11th floor which is the Starwood guest floor (which, other than a free bottle of water is just like every other floor in the hotel). The room was large and seemed clean on first glance (and for the most part was clean, but it\u2019s just so shabby it does appear to be dirtier; take my advice, however, and don\u2019t look behind the furniture unless you want to be grossed out\u2026I dropped a cord back there and had to fish it out and clean it off. Gross.). The window faced a parking lot and a landing strip for LAX \u2013 not a pretty view. The bed was the famous Heavenly bed and one of two things that I liked about this hotel. The other thing I liked was the food from room service. It came from an onsite restaurant called The Daily Grill and was really tasty. Calling room service, however, was a little challenging the first time I ordered (I had lunch one day and dinner one night and dessert one night \u2013 the key lime pie is phenomenal, btw) since they put me on hold for about 7 or 8 minutes. On the first night I was there, I had just started getting ready for bed \u2013 PJs on, face washed, teeth brushed \u2013 when the room starting making small tweeting noises like a small bird coming to gently wish me good night. The gentle tweeting quickly progressed to ear-shattering shriek in just under a minute (quicker than the check-in or room service ordering!). It wasn\u2019t an ongoing alarm, however. It came and went in erratic, one to fifteen second bursts of strident calls of imminent doom. Because I know that hotels have false alarms way more often than real alarms, I prudently called down to the front desk to see if all was well. I got a very soothing someone on the phone after about 20 rings who assured me that everything was in hand and there was no need for me to leave my room. OK. I accept that and in to bed I go. And then the alarm starts up again. And then stops. 1-5 minutes later, it starts again. This goes on for the next hour and by this time, it is 12:30 am on the night before my presentation. I tried to call down to the front desk again, but this time no one answered. I peeked out my front door and no one was around. This was about the time I decided to pack my stuff and get out. Yes, I know you\u2019re supposed to leave your stuff when there is a fire. However, I wasn\u2019t convinced there was a fire and if there wasn\u2019t, I was prepared to leave the hotel entirely to get a decent night of sleep. Of course, the elevators have now shut down so I grabbed my suitcase, my briefcase and my purse (all while cursing my tremendous sense of style which disallows me to pack lightly) and started walking down the stairs to freedom (still in my PJs, but now with boots! Hot!). Do you remember when I wrote I was on the 11th floor? Yeah. Super. I made it down to the 5th floor before someone from the hotel FINALLY got on the intercom system and told everyone that the alarm system was malfunctioning, there was no fire and go back to your rooms please. At this point, it\u2019s 1 am and I have a decision to make \u2013 go on downstairs, leave the hotel, find another, check in, etc. or trudge back upstairs and try to get whatever sleep remaining that I can. I went with option #2 and let me tell you, going up 6 flights of stairs with 1,000 lbs. of luggage at 1 am is unpleasant. Why didn\u2019t the hotel post employees on each floor to assuage the fears of their guests and keep them from walking around in PJs and boots? Even one guy posting signs on the elevators would have done it. This is just shoddy management. Couple this with the incredibly loud, shake the windows jet engines that blast off all night long from the very close LAX (and yes, I realize I chose an airport hotel, but I would expect better soundproofing for a hotel that was meant to be next to an airport) and you get about 2 hours of sleep. At least I did. That was the worst night of my stay, but the morning greeted me with another surprise \u2013 hot water in 5 second bursts only and then ice cold water in between. Refreshing!! Is there anything in the world worse than wanting a hot shower, but only getting cold water? Yes, the alarms at midnight, but this is pretty close second. It took me 20 minutes just to take a shower because I had to turn on the water to get my 5 seconds of hot water then turn it off quickly before the ice water hit my shivering body. This. Was. Miserable. I called down to the front desk who apologized and said someone would come fix it. Still wasn\u2019t fixed by the time I checked out. I ended up going the \u201csponge bath\u201d route to stay clean. To be fair, Matthew Morgan did contact everyone in the hotel after the alarm incident to apologize. I reminded Mr. Morgan of our previous email conversation and told him how disappointed I was with this property. He did take off the cost of the room on the \u201calarm night\u201d at my request (he didn\u2019t make this offer unprompted). He offered free hotel nights for future stays at this property which I declined. Even if you\u2019re offered a free [--] sandwich, you don\u2019t take it because it\u2019s still a [--] sandwich. Take my hard-earned advice since I didn\u2019t heed the warnings of other trip advisors. Don\u2019t stay here.

Airport noises didn't bother me at all. All in all, it was nice to see those SPG benefits in action. I slept soooo well, even on a rollaway! The rollaways have the same mattress as the normal beds, only smaller. Awesome comfort.

Smaller floor tiles, bathtub and old fixtures. Westin is known for their heavenly beds but it felt pretty regular. We remembered our first experience of the heavenly bed in Hawaii hence the reason we felt it we could never go wrong. I guess we were a little disappointed with the overall room quality.

Better sound proofing, similar price, more extensive updating and you can park right behind it at \"Easy Park\" for only $15 a day (or less).", "Date": "July 1, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York City, New York", "Title": "\u201cGreat Value and Service\u201d", "Author": "thegonzo", "ReviewID": "UR69229715", "Content": "I stayed once again at this property and really enjoyed it.

I was not recognized for my Elite Status, which I don't really care about, but note because it is usually a sign of things to come.

The buffet food looked as if it had been sitting there for hours. Once seated, the server did not greet me for 20 minutes for my drink order. 10 minutes later he showed up with my drink and I took that opportunity to order before he walked away. 40 minutes later---yes, 40--my food arrived. The woman at the table next to me, who ordered right after me, waited an additional 5-7 minutes. We were laughing amongst our tears. I finished and the server disappeared and I waited for 15 minutes. He never stopped by to see how things were, and the food was average at best (very small, poor menu). I planned on tipping him 10% due to the poor service, but when I asked for a duplicate receipt he told me to walk with him to the front cash register.

In both instances at this hotel, my room has been clean, well-lit, and spacious. The working area is nice. I'm not a huge fan of a chaise lounge instead of a chair and ottoman (sometimes you want to be able to sit in a chair without stretching out your legs), but that's a pretty minor detail. As is well-known, the Westin bed is great, and this property was no exception in that regard. You can occasionally hear an airplane landing or taking off...but, duh, it's next to an airport (and one that attacts a lot of big, noisy planes like 777s and 747s) so I don't fault the hotel for that.

I went to a 3 day seminar for business at this hotel and was on a very tight schedule 9am-11p each day with a 45 min lunch and 2 ten min breaks. I used my rewards points to book at this hotel and I stayed for 2 nights. I travel frequently for business and pleasure. On day two, on my limited lunch hour, I went up to my room and I couldn't get in! I went down to the front desk where 7 other potential customers and associates from the seminar were in line. After waiting 25 minutes and finally speaking to a front desk clerk, I find out I've been checked out of my room and need to check in again! The unprofessional agent tells me that she told me when she checked me in that I would need to recheck in the next day- WHAT?!! That doesn't even make sense...I told her she didn't tell me that, that I would definitely have remembered that and would have solved that issue when I was checking in the first time as I would not want to check in again. She continued to argue with me in front of business associates and potential customers telling me that she knows she told me and this was my fault. She also forgot to give me any parking pass upon check in so the previous day I had gone to my car in the parking lot and could not get out of the lot without the proper parking pass from the hotel. I had to re-park my car and go back upstairs to get a parking pass from another front desk clerk. She swears that she gave me the parking pass upon check in and thank goodness the other desk clerk was there to confirm that she got the parking pass for me much later that day after I checked in. I finally checked back into my room and had no time for lunch...10 minutes left to get back to my seminar. So, I decided to call the front desk manager, Daniela, to tell her what happened. After a couple minutes of telling my story, Daniela stopped me and said that I was not letting her get a word in edgewise and that she needed me to stop talking so she could try to resolve the issue!!!!! I've never been treated so disrespectfully at any hotel, EVER! Daniela continued on to tell me that the clerk had an impeccable record with all of their customers and was an exemplary employee...obviously not in this case! And, really, do I care about how she treated other people! I honestly have no words for this type of service or behavior...it's completely unprofessional. I previously worked in the travel industry for 10 years at high end resorts and I would have been fired for treating a customer this way! Is it really that hard to have good customer service and let go of trying to argue with customers so you can be right?? Daniela said on Saturday that she would award me starpoints for the inconvenience and pay for my dinner. I had to call the front desk again when I was leaving because they charged my credit card for the dinner which I was assured she would take care of! I'm still not sure if that's been credited as it's still on my credit card. I then had to send a personal email to Daniela on Monday to follow up on the Starwood Rewards points of which I received a form letter back saying I would have the credit. As of today, Friday, this still hasn't been done!!! She didn't even send me a personal email in return to confirm...honestly, she's the front desk manager and can't handle resolving a customer complaint personally with an email!!

We are staying for a week, so that's a problem. Second was the hot water. For 15 minutes yesterday, the water never got warmer than lukewarm in both the shower and sink.

My sense of smell is very good, sometimes too good, so some smells bother me that don't bother other people. The water in the shower smells of volatile organic compounds.

My breakfast experience was disappointing. The server waited on someone else who came in after me and after asking for my beverage 3 times I finally received it by asking another. The breakfast I ordered tasted terrible...the eggs didn't taste like eggs and the potatoes were very greasy and not tasty at all. Also I was charged for something on the mini bar that I didn't take! (I had picked it up while standing there to look at the label and put it RIGHT back in it's place) I was told later that since I moved it I was charged for it.

Needs some updating in the rooms and halls to be brought up to true Westin standards. The hotel staff was excellent. The service in the restaurant was the worst service ever. Took extremely long to get food and then it was undercooked and had to be sent back (pink chicken is not good). This hotel is not in a good location for anyone wanting to get out and take in the sights. My son and daughter in law spent the evening there the night before their cruise out of Long Beach. They caught a cab to go to a convenience store to purchase some items that they had forgotten and to grab some soda and a couple bottles of wine for the cruise. They went 1 mile and were charged $10 - they thought no problem we will just walk back to the hotel it was nice outside and still light out. BIG MISTAKE - they somehow got turned around and ended up at dusk in Inglewood. They were starting to get concerned when they realized that they could see the Westin sign but could not find a way to get around the 25 ft concrete wall to get to the hotel. They are young 23 year old couple and definately looked out of place walking in this area. They were hoping to come across a taxi so that they could catch a taxi back once they realized they were not in a safe area. Luckily a \"super shuttle\" employee drove by them and stopped and ask them if they were from out of town - they said \"yes\" and the super shuttle driver told them that they were in a dangerous area and should not be walking around - he asked if he could give them a ride to the hotel so that they got home safely. Needless to say they were both beyond grateful that they gentleman stopped to inquire about where they were needing to go. What is scarey is that this location in Inglewood was within arms length of this hotel. Of course the Westin cannot control this but word to the wise - do not venture out and about at this hotel - just a bit too scarey.

You pay for parking every day, they put a little snack bar in your room and you have to be careful not even to SHAKE it or you'll get charged, and they charge a 20% restocking fee on TOP of the ridiculously overpriced snacks. Needless to say, I didn't bother. The breakfast buffet is $21 (When I stayed at another hotel in San Diego it was *free* and had just as good offerings too) and, you'll pretty much pay through the nose for all of the little things.

I told her I'd call back later. We had been travelling back and forth from SD to LA and were exhausted.

The first person I talked to wasn't sure so they transfered me to the restaurant, who then told me, after going downstairs with food in tow, that no they actually can't do that since they don't have a microwave but there was one located on the 3rd floor. We go back up to the 3rd floor, wander around looking for this microwave and run into a maintenance tech who was the ONLY person in that entire hotel that actually showed any sort of customer service. He called several people multiple times to try and locate this mysterious microwave and after 20 minutes of checking in empty rooms, he apologized and said the he just didn't know where it could be. We headed back to our hotel room, and I tried to lobby again just one last time to see if they could direct us to the microwave. Well...the good thing is they did have a microwave. The bad thing is there was only one in the entire hotel and no, we couldn't use it because we weren't part of the flight crew and hung up. Upon check out, the guest services guy didn't even have the proper bill (I had to remind him to add on our parking costs which I really should've just kept quiet about), nor did he ask us how our stay was...which is probably for the best because I sure would've given him an earful.

As I had a 10:30 p.m. flight out of LAX across the continent, used the hotel during the day only. For a Priceline rate of just under $65, plus taxes/fees, the price made this a worthwhile option. Check-in was quick and I appreciated the fact that I was only charged $9 for the use of the parking, with in/out priviliges, instead of the normal rate of $18 for overnight guests. The FOX & Thrifty rental car companies are directly next door to the hotel so this was a good hotel since I could walk directly to it after returning the car after dinner. I have stayed here before a few years ago prior to flying out to Hawaii. The property is well suited to the airport, but is not much like other Westin properties I have been to. The hotel is tired and worn around the edges. They are trying to fix it up by rennovating the restaurant in the lobby, but the rooms are in need of an update. Stayed in room 867, overlooking the runway. It was interesting to watch the planes land and take off, so plane spotters take note. As mentioned above, the room is in need of some T.L.C. at there were many unsightly marks on the carpet, furniture and walls. The marble counter top on the work desk actually moves back and forth, which I found out by accident. The dresser had a large patch of wood ripped off the front that was repaired by a brown crayon (as if we wouldn't know the difference!) The T.V. is an older style \"tube\" model, which is now surprising to see in hotels. The bathroom was a standard size, but nothing to fancy. Had the typical Westin bath products, including the leaf shaped \"enima\" soap. (who came up with this shape?, so awkward when cleaning those unmentionable areas: pointy leaf shaped soap!) Adequate shower pressure and hot water. What was nice about the room was the fact that there was a small section of the large windows that could be opened. The pool area is a small, concrete wall fenced in area. One good thing about this property is the guest laundry located in the pool area. There are only a couple of machines, but this is a nice feature that many hotels do not have. The shuttle service to the airport is about every 15 minutes. There is a real time GPS map just inside the main doors that show you the location of the shuttle as they make their rounds in the airport and back. Cute gimmick to keep you busy while you wait. There is not much in the area, but there are a couple of restaurants. For plane spotters, there is a place called \"The Proud Bird\", on Aviation Road, visible from the hotel. The restaurant has vintage planes on display and from the main dining room one can watch the planes land. They even have head phones beside the tables that are connected to LAX approach so that the communication between the cockpit and the tower can be heard. There is also a place called Chalet Edelweiss, located on Supulveda, about 5 minutes away. Great, authentic, Swiss restaurant. Internet $11.95/day, Parking $18/night.

We parked on 4 but the doors into the hotel are on 3. I think if you park on 2 or 4 or anything else you take the garage elevator to 3 or lobby to access hotel. If you know that you can try to park on 3 all the time and avoid one elevator ride because once you're in the hotel you walk and use the hotel elevators to get to your floor. Maybe this is more \"secure\" but the clerk should inform you of this. The one set of elevators was not working for our stay which made it take a good 20 minutes to get on an elevator at busy times. As far as the room, it was good and fairly spacious. It was very, very quiet and we overlooked their roof maybe. Beds comfy but on the softer side. We wanted to use the fridge for other things but it only seemed to keep their drinks cold, or was broken, the outside felt hot to the touch. I chose the Westin because I love their double showerheads, which we had for one night. We came in one night to find dirty foot marks on the bathroom floor and wondered where it came from. They had switched out our showerhead and we had a single! No more \"heavenly shower\" for us!! We were ok with it but don't boast offering it if you're gonna take it away.

A free shuttle service will take you there first before going to the La Quinta and Holiday Inn right across the street. The ride takes about five minutes and runs 24 hours a day in 15 minute intervals. It is a small bus and the driver accepts, but does not expects tips. The hotel is on Century Boulevard in the direction of the airport. There are some fast food (Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and McDonald's) across the street near the other hotels mentioned above as well as a Denny's nearby, but not much else. Fortunately, rental car companies are close (there is a Thrifty rental right next door). The hotel appears to have been a luxury hotel in the 80s and is well-kept. The lobby is very nice and the bar is upscale. Guests are middle-class or above, but not upper-class. Many international visitors and there was a conference for Korean American Amway and a semi-formal for some Japanese college kids. I would say on average the hotel is somewhat below the Westin average in quality, but not by much. I liked it just fine. The front desk staff were generally attractive and professional. And they were friendly enough. I experienced no problems whatsoever at this hotel, so perhaps they could turn ugly as other reviewers have commented. However, nothing close to what happened to others happened to me. I reserved an Executive Room located on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor and it was excellent. Very spacious and nice. The view was a city view consisting of only the empty lots and cheap apartments across the street. My colleague's room overlooked the main entrance and the Hilton and other hotels as well as the airport. I noticed the roof of the entranceway was dirty and had lots of pigeon droppings (the only unclean factor of this hotel). The TV was not a flat screen, but a large brownvision. The window stretched all across one side of the wall. The bathroom was a bit like 80s-style Los Angeles, but nice enough. All amenities were provided. And, of course, you can't beat the Heavenly Bed which is the signature mark of Westin hotels. I saw in a sales brochure for hotel items that was in the room that you can order the mattress and bedding set for about $3500. I was tempted to order this set. Once again, I want to commend Westin for the best bedding ever! I slept so incredibly well here. A beautiful sleeping experience! I did not order room service, but I met my friends at the bar and we had a great time. The bill came out to nearly $100 plus a $20 tip for the three of us. They could mix any drink, I imagine since I ordered Tom Collins all night and they didn't blink (many bartenders need to ask what that is and they don't know how to make it). The servers were good, but could have came by more often. At least they didn't bother us or pester us by keeping asking us if we wanted more drinks. The bar is definitely what you would imagine an upscale airport hotel bar would be. I felt very comfortable there. Self parking was $18 per day and $28 per day for valet parking. There was a large BMW and some kind of sports car parked outside the hotel, but the cars in the self parking lot were varied in class. The weather was not that great (shocking for Los Angeles), so I did not see the pool. But another guest told me it was nice. SUMMARY: The hotel is located about a 30 minute drive on the 405 freeway to Beverly Hills, West L.A., and West Hollywood. So that is inconvenient for going out and shopping, etc. But if you are looking for a hotel by LAX, I would recommend this place. I have not stayed at other airport hotels in the Los Angeles area, so I can't compare. But I really enjoyed staying here. Although the next time I would probably stay closer to where the bars and shops are located and where all my friends live, if I had to stay near the airport I would most definitely stay here again. It's hard for me to believe these other reviews that are so negative, but I did not stay in a Standard Room and perhaps they were unlucky with service or something. The rate for the room, which I got directly through the Starwood Preferred Guest site, was also unbeatable for Los Angeles. It was unrefundable though.

I learned this as I got stuck in one of the elevators with one of the bellmen and he told me that the hotel is not going to do a big \"remodel\" and instead is just going to fix things little by little over time, as of my stay they were replacing two of the elevators top to tail as they had not been touched since 1985 when the hotel was built. Think about having only 4 elevators for over 700 rooms.......PLAN ON THIS when trying to make your flight on time at LAX. I have had the disprivlege of having to attend past events at this hotel and recently I had to stay here for a conference. I am ASTOUNDED at the incredible ineptness and pure apathy that the staff at this hotel embraces. 9 months prior, I had joined 6 friends who were staying here for cocktails and dinner, to make a very long story way too short (becasue it deserves to be told as NO HOTEL should be allowed to treat \"guests\" like we were treated), and it was the absolute WORST experience I have ever had with so called food and lack of customer service. So much so was it appalling that 3 months later there was an article in a local paper that talked about how many times the BBB has recieved complaints on this hotel and their poor saniation record. Fast forward to February 2009......surely things must have changed in the 9 months since I had been here last, I had to endure a full week at this hotel for a conference. NOTHING has changed, NOTHING. If anything, the entire hotel has gotten worse. The staff could care less about treating guests with respect and actually doing their job: I asked the housekeeper to please wipe off the window when I checked in as there were greasy handprints all over it.....SHE HANDED ME THE BOTTLE OF DLEANER and told me that she had already cleaned the room and didn't see where it needed cleaning.....and this was on the \"Starwood Preferred Guest Level\". This is after the hotel had checked me into 2 rooms that were already occupied. If I were less than a gentlemen, I could have walked out of the room with all of the jewelry I saw on one of the counters. The water pressure is non-existant, the elevators are old and one should plan an extra ten minutes to get down to the lobby if you are on the 12th floor. But, its the staff overall, they could care less about anyone but themselves. And the dingy conditions in the hotel, the beds look as if they came from a men's shelter, they are little better than cots....whatever happened to the \"Heavanly Bed\". You smell jet fuel int he hallways constantly, and if you are on the south side of the hotel, you will hear nothing but jet engines all day and night as the hotel lies at the end of the runway where the 747s and 777s take off.....remember that flights to Asia out of LAX depart between midnight and 2:00 a.m.....and they use REALLY BIG jets to fly to Asia.....try sleeping through that even with earplugs. Finally, on checkout, the hotel had a charge of $120 for \"bar charges\" at the Lobby Bar. I inquired about this at the front desk and they said that I had charged drinks to my room. I told them I had not even been to the lobby bar during my stay...which was totally true as their was a big party in the bar every night and it was PACKED and I didn't feel like waiting for 20 minutes for a drink. So, I asked the agent what were the dates of the charges and she told me.....they were for days that I WAS NOT EVEN CHECKED IN AT THE HOTEL !!!! I am not really sure how this could happen, having managed a hotel in a prior career, but she showed me on the screen. I asked to see the signatures from the bar and for it to be matched with my signature card I signed at check-in. She said that would take 2 weeks to obtain....WHAT????? And in the meantime, I would need to pay for the charges and then they would refund them in the event I had not signed. I called the manager over again and the conference organizer at that point and had them resolve the problem.......update...the manager had gone back and looked at the security tapes and found out that it was one of the employees that had been sitting in the bar and charged their night of drinks to the room that I just happened to be in. I was offered only a round of free drinks the next time I was in town. I swear on my daughter's eyes that I am not making this up, this place is a JOKE and SHOULD BE DEMOLISHED.

I have stayed at Westins before and have been happy, so this wasn't new but not at LAX. My wife and I were doing a last minute vacation extension for 2 days here so we found this at Hotwire for $100 a night total....ok seems good. We were dressed nice but in shorts and polos which I seemed to get a lot of looks from the staff, but that's OK as I understand this is a business traveler hotel especially in the week. We checked in and got to the room and it had the most filthy bathroom counter and dresser top almost like lotion was spilled on both. There were small items on the floor like hair clips and bits of paper. The bathroom smelled like cigarette smoke from the shower curtain. We were thinking \"Ok, not a big deal, but they could have tried harder.\" We then go to the pool, in which the pool chemicals we so off and strong that we had to get out sooner than we wanted. We have an in ground pool so we have a good idea. It was so bad that we both smell like chlorine 2 days afterwards even with 3 showers. This was by far the worst hotel pool that I have ever swam in. Last was the kicker and you must be aware of this before you stay. Our room was on the south east side. There is a business called the \"LA Kennel Club\" below on the street which is obviously a dog boarding kennel. The dogs were loudly audible 150 yards away from where our room was. They are put up at night around 9-9:30 but they are outside barking nice and loud early in the morning. I tried to get another room but none were available. Forget sleeping in if you want! The planes from LAX were a non issue for noise. Other than that, the hotel was nice and easy to get to LAX and other attractions. Of course parking is $18 per day. All of these items were told to the front desk person at check out and the operator. Both were not sincere with their apologies and no remedy was even remotely offered. My point is that we are in no way very picky people but even if you get a deal on this place, it still is not a deal. I wouldn't even be writing this review if it were the just the dirty room and the pool, but the dogs were way over the top.

RECEPTION: Was great. Friendly staff and no problems with our reservation. Check out time is noon but late check out (up to 2 pm) is available upon request. STAFF: Very nice. Everyone we talked to was friendly, helpful and professional. ROOM: Very clean with modern furniture. Nice white linens on the bed and the comforter was white as well - always nice if you are concerned with cleanliness (white hids nothing!). Comfy chaise-lounge, nice desk/with chair and a king sized bed were all included in our standard room. Basic cable TV included with option to purchase internet access in your room (via the TV). BATHROOM: Very clean. Nice towels. Double shower head was fantastic. Hair dryer was decent. The only thing we noticed it didn't have was a fan - which was odd - so the mirrors fogged up when we showered. HOTEL RESTAURANT: Very good...prices are about $2 more per item for room service. We ate in the restaurant once for dinner and once for breakfast and throughly enjoyed both. We had great service at the restaurant and the food was also very good. A nice selection of items on the menu. HOTEL BAR: Nice bar area. Bar service until approx. 1 am (sometimes a bit later). You can also order food at the bar if the restaurant is closed or if you just want a change of atmosphere. The bartenders were friendly and we had excellent service. SHUTTLE: The airport shuttle runs 24/7. You don't need to call from the airport, simply go to one of the centre \"Shuttle/Courtesy Pick Up\" locations. The shuttles run loops through LAX and between the Westin. The hotel has a GPS in the shuttles so they can let you know how long it will be until one is back at the hotel ready to return to LAX. They come about every 10-15 minutes though. OTHER: There is also a pool and hot tub on the 3rd floor (outdoors) both were very nice and the area was very clean. There is a nice gym as well (also on the 3rd floor). Valet parking is available. Animals are welcome - there was a large German Shepard staying in one of the rooms while we were there.

Forget about the stains--I could probably deal with that. It was how dirty and sticky the carpet felt barefoot and even with socks on. I could feel my socks stick to the floor as I walked across the room. I had to wear shoes at all times. Simply speaking, the room was grimy.

One morning we drove to a place near by to get some breakfast, and when we got back 45 min later we found a sign at the parkade that it was full!

Los Angeles is a car city, so just use this hotel as a base and drive out to the shopping malls or the sights you want to see. There should be a car rental attendant in the lobby, it was once Avis, but not Enterprise. So I suggest that you rent a car from them as this reduces your trouble of driving it back to the lot.

Here are some more details... Room: I got a room on the 4th floor. It was surprisingly large compared to a friend who stayed down the street at the Hilton. The King bed was lovely and very comfortable. I loved the sheets, comforter, and pillow. The room was surprisingly cold and I had to adjust the vent. I liked their Starbucks coffee and cups. The room had a fridge, but I couldn't figure out how to turn it on. The shower was great, it had 2 showerheads and delivered great water pressure (once water returned). Restaurant/Bar: I did have dinner one night in the bar and it was so-so. They had a thing called \"Unwind\" and were offering Martini's for $5. I didn't participate so can elaborate much on it. Service: I thought it was ok. Once I complained about the water situation, they were quick to offer up some comps. Front desk people seemed a tad lost...

First we arrived to learn that there would be no water in the hotel from 10PM until 6AM the next day, but they would compensate us by giving us two bottles of water and encouraging us to fill up the bath for future use. They did in the end comp us 1 night of free internet and a breakfast. The next morning the water did not come on until after 8 and it was brown, and had black bits of stuff in it. We did not feel comfortable drinking it after that. The free buffet breakfast that they normally charge almost $20 for was really not worth having, even the danish tasted odd. The AC in the room was not working, and never did, even after a multiple of phone calls that were never answered. The temperature in the room at night never went below around 74 even though I had it set to the low 60s. I opened the window in disgust at 2AM and even that did not bring the temperature lower than 72 which is obviously what they allow in AC! They offer this very fancy very thick bedding that was more suited to an igloo than to this sweatbox room. The room and hotel is as dated as others have written And then there was the infernal barking, and more barking. We were 7 floors up, and the noise was unbearable during the day. When we could not stand any more of it, I called and was more sharp, and at last they took the dogs inside. We booked through Priceline unfortunately, as I would have left this hotel after one night and gone elsewhere. I told them so at the front desk and they comped another day of internet and breakfast.

Upon check-in they informed me my bed choice wasn't available....well, no surpise there as it happens every week.....they are usually helpful in finding me at least a room on the club level....and they did this time.....the last room down the hall....after walking past 10 open rooms with various exhibits and conferences going on (the piano wizard looked so interesting) I entered the room....OMG....it hadn't been updated since the hotel opened.....old brass fixtures which were so weathered they were green.....the sink and vanity was a gross one piece seashell shaped thing in pink marble and the room had very ornate gold fixtures and detailed dental crown molding....where in the heck was I?? Certainly not at a Westin!!! It reminded me of a tour to the Liberace house in Vegas (had to go there for a biz event, not by choice). My expectations of the Westin LAX are not high - I know what to expect but this was a shock! I immediately went back down to the Gold/Plat SPG desk and asked for another room.....kudos to the team for trying and after 15 minutes they offered me a new room....again on the club level, two queen beds....the second room smelled like cat urine and over looked a dog kennel....what a pleasure to go to sleep and wake to the sound of barking dogs. According to the SPG desk, this was the best they had for an \"elite\" SPG guest as they just had too many conference attendees. The conferences were not restricted to conference rooms, they were going on in the rooms up and down every hall....it was uncomfortable walking to and from my room.....creepy actually since you felt like you had to watch over your shoulder as you entered your room at night! It was a long 4 nights......my last 4 nights at the Westin LAX. The hotel is in dire need of an update and some employee monitoring. While the first room they gave me is not typical of the other rooms in the hotel, they haven't been updated in some time either. I know as I was staying there weekly in 2000 when they updated them to their present decor. Rarely do I get a room where the \"Heavenly Bath\" is actually heavenly....the second shower head never works, water pressure is not consistant, tiles are chipped, grout is moldy and the carpet is worn and stained. Housekeeping is hit or miss...sometimes they leave bottled water and coffee, sometimes they clean the bathroom and leave new towels, sometimes they vacumn, sometimes they empty the trash.....you get the picture. I can handle one night here and there but not weekly and not for extended stays. Don't expect great service for dinner or the lobby lounge (unless you are lucky to have Gabi wait on you...she is fabulous and goes the exttra mile for her guests). The other waiters and bartenders look at you like you are from outer space...not sure why you are there..well gee....I want to get a bite or something to drink...they will walk by the table multiple times until you are forced to stand at the bar to order. Frankly the only reason I haven't switched before now is Gabi's service...but that isn't enough after this last visit! You can't walk around the hotel area at night....Century Blvd. is a haven for adult shops and XXXX men's clubs....it is simply not safe to be off the hotel grounds at night....especially if you are a solo female. If ur looking for a cheap place to crash before heading to LAX, then try it...if you don't expect much other than a 2-3 star, you won't be too upset. I am off to LA this week again and staying at the Marriott Manhattan Beach. The area is safe and surrounded by shops, markets and many places to dine....within walking distance of the hotel yet still very close to LAX.

We had two rooms, one on the eighth floor, one on the eleventh - both rooms faced the street. We could hear airplanes, but not loud enough to lose sleep over. Then again, I love airplanes so I could sit there and watch them land for hours! I briefly heard the dogs barking that other people have mentioned, but only faintly. The room itself was typical Westin with all of the standard amenities, although with two (very comfortable!) Queen beds I thought the room was a bit small. Functionally everything in the room worked great. Cosmetically the room was very clean, although the door to the minibar cabinet didn't open properly because it was only hanging on by one hinge. I also noticed one electrical outlet that was starting to come loose from the wall. Everything in the bathroom was great and all of the plumbing worked fine. Breakfast at Westin hotels is normally expensive, so we hit one of the fast food places down the street - an easy walk. Century Blvd. is busy, but the Westin has a stop light with a crosswalk so you can easily and safely cross the street.

I immediately called the Westin Central reservations number I had in my Palm Treo and asked to speak with the front desk at the Westin LAX. First I asked them if they had availability, they did, and he quoted me the rate of $129. Normally this would have been fine. But the fact that it was 12am and I had to leave in 6 hours to catch my flight I decided to explain my situation and told him that AA gave me a distressed passenger rate at Hilton for $89.99. He had asked me to hold and few moments later I was asked how long I would be there in because they were offering $85 for the night! Westin I tell you! Im sure they had a lot of rooms available, regardless, its the service that I appreciate! I took the first shuttle over. I was greeted with a smile at the front desk and within 10 minutes I was on the Starwood preferred floor in my room under the warm duvet.

We faced the runway and were on the back of the hotel. The suite had a little terrace with some seating, which was pretty nice, but there wasn't much to look at except some planes landing. The room was pretty clean, but the funiture was a bit frayed (a hole here and there, stains, etc.). The desk area was expansive, but there was no wireless and the internet was about $10 a day. The room did have a lot of windows, which was nice. The bathroom was the standard heavenly bath, but probably hasn't been refurbished in awhile. The bedroom was the same, but the bed was comfortable. I like that the heavenly bed is completely washable. We ate room service, and the food was standard room service prices and quality. Not that great, a bit pricey, but decent. The lobby was large, and there was a ton of conventions/weddings going on. There seemed to be a standard group of travellers eating alone or reading the paper. The biggest minus for me was that behind the hotel was a dog kennel. All night long we could hear dogs barking, especially in the early morning. We did not have our windows open, and we were near the top floor. It was pretty bad. Also, there was a wedding in the courtyard, and we could hear the music pretty late. I guess if you are willing to stand the plane noise, the rest doesn't matter, but for us, the planes were the least bothersome of the three. Also, the bellman took a long time to get our bags upon departure, and the shuttle came infrequently enough that we could not wait for it, so we had to take a cab anyway, which was kind of pricey.

Having booked through Priceline, I was expecting the typical \"you booked through a discount service\" treatment that some front desk staffers tend to give (you know, treating you like you're a second-class citizen, giving you the worst room etc) but was pleasantly surprised. The valets were friendly and helped with my luggage (granted, I'm a young, moderately attractive female, which can help in such situations) and as we walked through the expansive lobby the front desk staffers smiled and even waved at my 4 year old son. We checked in easily and were told our luggage would be brought up to our room. The lobby has a lovely fountain with seating and a lounge/bar which looked nice (being alone with a 4 year old I never had cause to use it) We arrived at our room - number 504 - and I held my breath, not sure what I'd find. Entering the room, I was very happy with what I saw - A very good sized room with two queen beds (lots of pillows - usually a good sign) and the far wall was floor to ceiling windows with a view of, well, it's LAX so there are no \"fantastic\" views possible, but it was facing the courtyard and street. My son thought this was amazing. One little thing; A pet peeve of mine is that windows in massive hotels don't usually open, which means no fresh air for the duration. I know it's for safety, but....Anyway, this room had a small slit window built into the floor to ceiling windows that you could open to get some fresh air. Great! The room itself wasn't spectacular, but it was perfectly nice. Comfy beds with nice, clean plush duvets, an oversized armchair, a large desk and tv stand with an empty fridge for your drinks etc, clean bathroom with constant hot water (a must for me...I like it scalding hot) and great water pressure. Also, the room itself was very spacious for a standard two queen room. No feeling cramped with my sons toys spread everywhere and 3 large suitcases. Most hotels have \"better\" floors and \"better\" rooms, so (as is obvious by the varying and conflicting reviews about this hotel) I can't speak for the other rooms in the hotel, but ours was really very nice. No complaints. I DO, however, have a few complaints about the \"extras\". Yes, this is where hotels really get you. So when getting that great deal on Priceline etc, note this: Valet parkinig costs $24/night! Ouch. It's still pricey for self-park at $15/night. There is internet access in the rooms, but it's $10/day or $5/30 minutes. Ouch again! In room movies are always nice for that late night boredom, but be prepared to spend $14 for one. And finally, there's room service. Wow. The food was decent, and of course they are going to over-charge (all hotels do) but salads are $17-$20, and a burger $17. Don't waste your money. If not for the pricey extras, I'd have given it 5 stars. All in all a good place to stay when near the airport.

The internet did not work, even though I spent 20 minutes on the phone with tech support trying to get it to function properly. There was a light in the room with no lightbulb in it. Once I got a lightbulb, the lamp worked until I tried to turn it off. But the lamp was broken and wouldn't turn off, so I crawled around on the floor behind the bed to unplug it. The TV did not work properly: I could not access the pay per view movies and the reception on the tv made it only borderline watchable.

Other details that were ignored in the hotel: when I tried to purchase a bottle of water from the vending machine, the one on my floor wasn\u2019t working. I literally had to go to five different floors to find a working machine. The gym had several pieces of broken equipment and no clean headsets for the televisions.

The price was right ($54/night on priceline), and parking is only $15/night here, compared to $25 downtown. But there is nothing fun or charming in the immediate area except fast food and gas stations--and the airport, of course, conveniently nearby. The rooms are good sized, but very standard. No frills, and the views are downright Dickensian in their grimness. The pool is small and plain--they do have nice teak loungers with cushions, but the cushions are not attached to the chairs and keep sliding off the end...also, the pool area is surrounded by concrete walls and it can get very hot out there. We never could get a drink in the lobby lounge area, although the bar was going at all hours...I didn't really like how it is sort of open to the lobby area ,and is very noisy.

I could have done that while my eggs were still warm. Food was also not to the level I expect from a Westin. It wasn't bad, just not as good as I think Westin can be (this was more mid level hotel food.) The shuttle service is horrible. While the drivers are nice & helpful, the route is so long that you are waiting a long time.

Not a good first impression to the hotel. The best part of the room was the bed. It looked great. Sheets were a little scratchy, not as soft as I've had in other Westins. Carpeting was badly stained, one closet door was not fully on its track, the in-room safe was closed/locked, the veneer edge of the dresser was broken in a section, the carafe for the coffee was missing its lid, the lights on the alarm clock indicating that the alarm has been set weren't working so I didn't know if it would go off, was getting a lot of noise from the airport...not major problems, (except the carpet which really was disgusting, and the alarm clock which could cause you to miss a flight), but lots of little things that added up to an experience that is not to Westin standards. Good things--the bed looked great, great bath robe, nice towels, soap, Starbucks coffee in room to be brewed, real cream for the coffee (this makes up for the carpet.)

That probably saved us $20 over the course of four days. There was also free internet access in the lounge. Of course the Heavenly Bed is awesome, as is the Heavenly Shower. As one reviewer noted, it took some time for the water in the sink to come out cold, but it eventually happened - no big deal.

I actually found the sound comforting, and enjoyed watching the planes come in. Maid service was exceptional; cleanliness was perfect. Parking, yes, it's $15 a night.

She blocked off two specific rooms and told me they were nice. Upon arrival, we checked in at the \"Platinum and Gold desk\", and they promptly told me that they only had a reservation for 1 room. I had to dig out my confirmation numbers and found them, and then it became obvious that they had given the blocked-off rooms away. Eventually they had 2 other rooms for us, but when we got there they were not connecting. I called down to the Platinum and Gold desk and the guy said \"Sorry, we don't have any other rooms.\" He didn't offer any alternatives or anything! I guess he was going to leave me paying for 2 rooms I couldn't use, or force my wife and me to sleep in different rooms... Eventually, I got him to give me his manager who did eventually find us two connecting rooms. That first night continued to be disasterous, as the two rooms he gave us were right outside of the service elevator exit, and the staff was bursting through the doors all night, with the doors banging loudly. They were also laughing and yelling the entire night. Speaking of elevators, only 2 of the 6 guest elevators were \"working\", and one of them would get stuck on floor 9 about 1 of 3 times using it (had to walk up to floor 12 every time it happened). This elevator situation is a common theme at this property, as we've stayed here 3 times since June (the other problems were not quite as bad). So I would say the average wait time for an elevator was around 25 minutes....I'm *not* exaggerating. The management did change our rooms again after the first night, and the 3rd set of rooms were not outside the service elevator door. But it wasn't until we were in bed that we realized the air conditioning was not working. The kids were already asleep, so we could not call maintenance so we sweated through the night. The next morning I called the manager and she promised to send maintenance up to fix it. 8 hours later, when we returned, it still wasn't working. I called the front desk and they sent someone up right away, and it took him 30 seconds to open a valve that someone must have closed. The maintenance guy told us that it was the first time he was called about it, so the manager obviously never called in the morning. That evening, we ordered room service, and after a long wait, it arrived with the wrong flavor of ice cream. We called down, and they said they would take care of it. 60 minutes later (again, not an exaggeration), no sign of anything. We called again, and they answered with an apology (before even saying hello), and said they were sending up the ice cream right away, \"on the house.\" Not sure what that means, because it was supposed to come with dessert anyway and we already paid for it. 40 minutes later (not an exaggeration), the phone rang, and they informed us that they did not have that flavor of ice cream.

Woke me up a few times, but I was the one that requested the room on the airport side because I love planes. Not the fault of the hotel. The second problem was when I discovered I left my toothbrush in NZ. Took a few calls before brush and paste were brought to my room. Staff apologized so no worries.

We had a reasonable greeting by the front desk, and really wanted to stay in a smoking room (which, their website had informed us, was fully booked) -- they were able to accomodate the switch with no problems. The lobby is big, and visually appealing. Corporate casuals are lurking all over the place (it's used as a conference hotel primarily, it seems), and the lobby offers a friendly greeting -- although, it's nothing special. When we got into the room, I was let down. This hotel has a 4-star rating, yet the room is as bland as most 3 stars. Nothing special. Small TV. Dataports (no wireless), a couple of telephones. Poor bathroom with no real air venting... turn the shower on for more than a couple of minutes, and the room turns into a suana -- a pain in the rear when you're sharing your room with a business colleague and can't escape naked into the main room to continue getting dressed! It was clear the room hadn't been fully cleaned upon our first entrance. There was a spare bed folded in the corner, and no toiletries in the room. When I called the desk, they took over an hour to send up someone to give us a few towels and shampoo (although, the cleaners were somewhat friendly when talking to them in the halls). The bed was very comfortable, if you like soft beds. I got some good sleep, which is rare. Overall, the room was very bland and boring. Nothing special at all, and nothing that could distinguish it from a million other hotels. I didn't like spending a lot of time in the room, it really felt like I wanted to get out everytime I was in there. The conceirge was moderately helpful, although took 20 minutes to find a certain location of the city. The location is terribly poor for anything other than conferencing... a cab to Hollywood/downtown will cost $50-60 one-way, easily. The food... abysmal. I thought I was paying $13 for a chicken sandwich (according to their menu). After tax and a ridiculous service fee, and being charged for a salad when it was listed as being apart of the meal, I paid $27... more than double. And the taste? Awful. McDonalds serve better, for $4. The breakfast buffet was probably the best thing -- but $18 for a mediocre choice pushed it OTT (like most of the charges in this hotel). The buffet lunch was very poor -- limited choice @ $25 per plate. Yikes. When I wanted to extend my stay, they gave us conference rates for the additional days, which was nice -- meaning, we got a $30-40 discount per night... very welcomed. But that was soon overshadowed when I received the hotel bill on the final day. I had made several calls to the UK... WOW... $283 for 11 minutes on the phone!!! This, I found to be absolutely ridiculous. I called my girlfriend for 58 seconds on the first night -- that \"goodnight\" call cost me $47. When I questioned the desk, they told me it was due to AT&T rates... pure BS.. I've called from other hotels and it has been NOTHING like this... $47 for a ONE MINUTE call to the UK??? It's never cheap calling from a hotel, but this was overboard. It's 3 cents a minute with a calling card. I expected maybe a few dollars a minute... not nearly fifty bucks! Overall, if you're going for a conference, it's not a bad hotel. Certainly not worthy of a 4 star rating, though. And if you're going to explore LA or vacation to the city -- forget about it. The location is terrible, unless you want to be right near the airport, and going anywhere in the city will cost you at least $50 each way... there's nothing nearby of interest. I would only re-visit this hotel if forced (i.e. if another conference was being held here that I needed to go to).
