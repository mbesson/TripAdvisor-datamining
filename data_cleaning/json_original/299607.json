It was understaffed, they were rude and the quality of the recently (we were the first to stay in the newly renovated room) renovated room was terrible for a '4 star'. The mirrors had paint on them, the tiles and bathroom was old and had been siliconed like a child had done it. One of the tiles had been siliconed together as a repair. The mattress was terrible and the quality of bedding was also very poor. The minibar was not stocked. There was no concierge or similar. On arrival we could not even access the driveway in a taxi as the car park entrance had broken down and cars were banked up out on to the street. I and other guests had to unload our luggage out the front of a construction site and walk through mud to get the the hotel entrance. The hotel staff could see all this and offered no assistance or apologies.\u00a0 I was very annoyed at the quality of the hotel we also ran into other guests that had worse problems such as broken air conditioning and unhelpful staff. We had planned on extending our stay if we enjoyed this hotel however we have today moved to another much nicer hotel. When moving hotels I told the taxi driver that they rate themselves as a 4 star. He laughed and said they have closed twice in the last 18 months due to complaints of mould and similar. I am not sure if this is true however i can only comment my experience and it was very poor.

The hotel is, relative to its price, unusually well-known and filled to capacity given that the accommodations are spartan at best. There is soap in the bathroom, but prepare for the flood you'll create each morning, for example, due to a shower without a real curtain. The air conditioning works, essential in Singapore, and if there is the slightest problem with a system in the building the staff will help you immediately, from their internet to their climate control. Bedding is what you'd buy at Target...including the rock hard mattress. There is no room here, which in Singapore is not something you have to assume. Other hotels have nicer larger rooms in the same price category. The buffet that is included for breakfast is inedible, and the food served by the restaurant more generally would be a shame for anyone to eat if they have any capacity to leave the hotel on foot or by cab. Down the street for example is one of the city's best curry restaurants by all accounts. Pricing for food is outrageous, and the night's entertainment, which resonates through the entire hotel due to insufficient insulation, borders on porn and you'd really think you were in the movie Lost in Translation -- barely dressed women sing bad karaoke and shake it in your face. Actually that is worth seeing. But for about 5 minutes. The desk staff literally said \"we totally understand\" when after 7 of my 9 days I elected to pay out the remainder of my stay and move to the Intercontinental downtown because I just couldn't take it anymore -- I felt like a hamster in a small cage. My Asian next door neighbor said the same and he was from Tokyo! But the big surprise was yet to come. Two weeks after returning to the U.S. I discovered that I had giardia, a protozoan that is often in unfiltered water in southeast asia. I was assured that it was simply no problem whatsoever to drink the water from the hotel. I boiled it a lot of the time but eventually, every day, the bottle of water in my room ran out and they said \"the water is filtered and Singapore water is great.\" Ask me -- really don't -- what it is like to have giardia. Other than the hotel I didn't have a glass of water anywhere that didn't assuredly have filtered water, and the load of giardia in my system made it obvious that the hotel has the protozoan little monsters loaded up. They aren't lethal, but they transmit to your pets and the outcome is an intestinal nightmare that often doesn't heal for months. Trust me on this one. If you go here, don't drink the water. Or use the ice. PERIOD. But if you are on a TIGHT budget this will do for a couple of nights if you understand what you are getting (and if you don't want to bother to shop around).", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cValue for money\u201d", "Author": "AngelineSkyhotel", "ReviewID": "UR115540789", "Content": "Great hotel and value for money, though location not too impressive.

The hotel is a little way from Orchard Road and therefore you needed to take the courtesy bus (Mon - Fri only) to either the nearest MRT station or Orchard Road. The hotel was very comfortable though the room was quite small, but as we don't spend much time in our room this was fine. Breakfast each morning was OK. Though if you like the usual Full English Breakfast you may be a bit disappointed. Lots of Chinese food at Breakfast. We didn't eat in the Restaurant but did use the Bar Meal Menu. This was good food and very reasonably priced, either eating outside or inside the bar where there was a group playing each night. There is also a satay area set up outside which is very good. The staff were very friendly but any requests took days and several requests before you got what you needed. We asked for extra towels and after 2 days of requesting each morning we were given extra blankets. We asked again on the 3rd day (twice) and finally got 2 extra towels. We checked out at the usual time but as our flights were not until midnight we asked for a courtesy room to freshen up in before our journey home. We were told to go to the pool area and use the shower room there. This was quite cramped for 2 of us with our luggage, but we managed to take a shower and freshen up. We were given a voucher for a complimentary drink which can be used at anytime during your stay, which is nice, and although we paid for room only we were given a voucher on arrival for breakfast every morning. If you are happy to travel to the sights and shops this is a good base, but as the courtesy bus does not run at weekends you will need to use taxis but these are frequently coming to/from the hotel and we had no trouble getting one when we needed it.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Folkestone, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cA nice place to stay in a very hot climate!\u201d", "Author": "scottcabal", "ReviewID": "UR16207491", "Content": "I stayed at the Quality hotel as it was the cheapest hotel that was available with the exact package I booked through my travel agent. I didn't expect anything amazing, but was pleasently surprised with a very nice hotel with a nice room, good food and friendly staff. It is located on Balestier Road which is a little bit outside of the city centre (an hour or more walk) but the subway is at the end of the road and during the week a free shuttle is provided hourly to take you to the subway and Orchard Road shopping district. The neighbourhood the hotel is in is more local than touristy which is nice. The shuttle doesn't operate at weekends so I decided to walk all the way to Orchard Road. It was a very exhausting walk but I saw some nice places I wouldn't have otherwise seen. However I really would not recommend the walk - my shoes actually completely broke in half in the sole and disintegrated around the seams from the heat and humidity. There is a shopping mall near the hotel though which remedied this. If you stay here at the weekend, the shuttle isn't operating and you don't want to walk to the subway then just get a taxi - they are efficient, friendly and cheap all around Singapore. The room was clean, functional, with a nice view, good TV channels and VERY good air conditioning which trust me you will need all the time you are in your room. The room is a nice place to relax if you are tired, or if you are escaping the heavy rain storms which occur for half hour or so every afternoon. The breakfast at the hotel was nice. It included a selection of everything for everybody but also some things you wouldn't expect in a hotel in the UK (rice for breakfast for example). It also had chicken sausages which I've never had but were really nice. The staff at the hotel were VERY friendly and helpful. They always had a smile on their face, made checkin go smoothly, always prided themselves in giving good service etc. They were also helpful with any query or request you had. For example my flight didn't depart until 22.30 and I was being picked up at 7pm. They allowed me to keep my room until 6pm for no extra charge. Tip for people that stay here - you each receive a voucher for a free welcome drink when you arrive at the hotel. This can be used at any time during your stay so it's quite nice to sit and relax with it before departing if you have an afternoon departure. Overall I really enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend it to others. It is not a huge world-class or 5 star hotel like Raffles but if you are after a nice, affordable, friendly hotel in a quieter location (if that's possible in Singapore) then this is a good hotel to stay at.", "Date": "May 19, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "cramlington", "Title": "\u201cquality it is\u201d", "Author": "rafaman", "ReviewID": "UR14228399", "Content": "The Quality Hotel is located on Balestier Road which is a little way out of the city centre.
