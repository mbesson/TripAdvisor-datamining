The free wifi was very temperamental, and gave lots of hassles, but we managed to get through from time to time. That was the only negative of our stay. The hotel breakfast was pretty good. A wide variey from yoghurt and fruit to eggs and bacon. We enjoyed having something different to the usual European breakfast of pastries / cold meat / cheese only. It's a 5 minute walk from the nearest metro station, Lepanto, which makes it convenient for getting around, and about 20 mins walk from the Vatican (although you can catch the underground to a slightly closer stop). Getting there from the Termini station took us about 45 minutes in total, once we had walked through the termini station from where the trains are. That was a little unexpected, but very manageable. If you're not up for walking with your bags, then better to take a taxi. I would recommend this hotel. One word of caution: be very very careful when choosing where to eat. Get a recommendation from someone. We didn't have one nice meal in Italy. Most restaurants are tourist traps, poor quality, very expensive and generally awful.

When we (group of some 7 or 8 people) said we would talk to our tourist agent, the staff only until then called someone and agreed to change the room. The staff explained that she was just listening to orders. The room was changed and found satisfactory.
