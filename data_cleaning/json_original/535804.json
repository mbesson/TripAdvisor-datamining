First of all, they need to work on their cleaning, I happened to drop my sweat shirt on the floor in this Lobby area on the 1st floor, I picked it up and it was completely covered in dust, like it hadn't been swept in a year. The room was great! Very spacious. The bathroom was small but was handy to have a heated towel rail considering it was winter. My only issue with the bathroom is that the shower was tiny! It was a corner shower and half the entrance of the shower was blocked by the corner of the sink being in the way so you had to squeeze around the sink and step around the toilet to get into it. Also there were no shelves in the shower to put your soap yet barely enough room to bend over to pick up your shampoo bottle that you had to put on the floor! Location of the hotel was good, right across the road from the Termini train station and also lots of places to eat. Probably wouldn't recommend walking around the back of the hotel, poorly lit, dodgy people loitering about and looked like the ghetto. Kind of enjoyed the church bells chiming at 7am and later in the day. Hotel staff were friendly apart from the waitress in the breakfast room who would stand there and watch over us like a hawk. it made for very uncomfortable dining. One other thing that bothered me is that my room mate and I were asleep in our room down the corner end of a corridor, when at 3am someone came stomping down the corridor straight up to our door and started jiggling the door handle and then quickly left when the door didn't open. They didn't even try to use a key.

Let me start my review by saying that the location is just wonderful. It is directly across the street from the Termini train station, so you never have to worry about getting lost in Rome. Just find any bus stop and for 1 euro you'll take the bus to Termini. The location is phenomenal. And for a quick word of advice to anyone who wants a great grocery store in Rome, on the lower level of the train station there is a huge supermarket. It's definitely the place to get any food or drinks you want very cheap. Moving onto the actual hotel...personally as long as there is working a/c and water and a bed, that constitutes a good hotel to me. I'm not very picky and I didn't go to Rome to hang out in a hotel room. The hotel room was a good size and the bathroom was a surprisingly good size for Europe. The shower was very small though. The staff weren't the friendliest people ever though, but when I needed to make a phone call, they helped me. One thing that disappointed me was that there was no WIFI at the hotel. Overall, I loved Rome and I thought that Hotel Siracusa was a great hotel that met all our needs.

Being that we didnt have anywhere else to sleep we were obiligated to give them the last euros we had on our last night in Italy. I explained this to her, I told her I didnt want to exchange any more money because we where traveling back home the other day. She said well you need to pay cash if you want to sleep here. I asked if we can try the credit card later on and she could give us our money back. She said yes. Two hours later the credit card machine was still down and I asked if she would call the credit card company and ask for a approval manually so that we would have our room paid for and we could have our cash back she said NO. Then we asked if we can pay in US Dollars (some countries let you) she said this is Europe and we use Euros here.(I wish I could expian the gestures she was making) then I told her she should learn how to treat a customer and learn when she should shut her mouth.

I just returned from a 4-day stay in Rome in \"the worst place on earth\", the Siracusa. I didn't run as far as I could. Well, I confess: I travelled a lot in Italy with schoolgroups (I am a teacher), and I've never stayed in such a pretty place like this. The breakfast was - compared to Italian standards - luxurious: two types of cereals, cheese, mortadello, ham, yoghurt, fresh bread (instead of crackers), drinkable coffee, cake, fruit pie, fresh fruits etc. In my room I discovered some other luxuries: a shower wall (never seen in Italy in a three star hotel) and air conditioning (working!). The room was cleaned (I looked desperately for the bed bugs...) every day and there was no need to open the windows for half an hour because the room smelled. Even the hotel staff was not too rude or too chaotic (quite exceptionnal in Italian three star hotels). So my conclusion is: if you are looking for a basic hotel in a good location (transportation, bars, food stores, supermarkets...), just go for the Siracusa. The neighbourhood of the Termini station is not so attractive, but safe by day. Don't mind the litter, the streetsellers, the beggars and the shabby hotel fa\u00e7ade, they are quite harmless.

It was sponsored by EF Tours. When I read the Trip Advisor reviews posted about the Hotel Siracusa, I was both disappointed and worried, as we had no control over the hotel that was selected. Once we arrived, however, I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the hotel was across the street from Termini, but none of us was ever accosted by anyone. We educated our kids in safety and assertiveness skills with street merchants and pickpockets made it a point to have at least one chaperone per 5 kids throughout our entire trip. Interestingly, our kids had more encounters with scam artists in other parts of the city (e.g. Piazza Novana and outside the Vatican), but were perfectly safe because we stayed close by and would not let them give their money away. There were 2 or 3 internet cafes around the corner and a handy shop next door for purchasing chocolate, pastry and gelatti at very reasonable prices. There were also many nice shops, an ATM and a pharmacy across the street at the train station. We learned that in most cafes where you are not sitting at a table, you must tell the cashier first what you want to buy, pay for it, and then bring the receipt to the counter. The hotel was typically European, with a tiny lobby, marble floors and large windows, but also limited space in each room. This was OK for us because we spent most of our waking hours on the go so we could enjoy every aspect of Rome in the limited time we had. The beds were comfortable and nice looking. We had no problems with \"bed bugs\" or air conditioning (it was February) as sited in other reviews. A few times our students blew out fuses for using the wrong kind of hair dryer and the staff were very accommodating and patient with us. We had almost an entire floor to ourselves and so our students often congregated in the halls until 10 PM or so. We noticed, however, that most of the people staying in the hotel were student groups and some were much louder and less supervised than ours. This is definitely not a place for a couple to take a romantic getaway, but perfect for the needs of a group of students, especially if you are on a group tour with a company that has a good relationship with the staff and can communicate with them for you.

The breakfast room opened at 7:00 a.m. One morning we had an early tour and I tried to get some juice at 6:50, ten minutes before they \"opened\". I was immediately kicked out. I tried to explain that we were going on a tour and just wanted some juice to drink on the bus. Too bad, we don't open until 7:00 was the message I got even though the girl spoke minimal English. We had put our passports, return tickets and extra money int the room safe and were able to access it several times without a problem. Then one day it simply wouldn't open!! We were in a panic as we were leaving in 2 days. The desk person said he couldn't do anything about it, but made a note of it for the next day. The next morning someone came and entered a code and it opened. As it turned out, we were not the only one this happened to, another person in our group had the very same thing happen to them. The Siracusa seems to be used a lot for school groups and there always seemed to be a lot of noisy teenagers around. They partied at night making a lot of noise, which we could hear very well, since the walls were so thin. While on the subway, I had my pocket picked. I had carried my wallet on a cord around my neck and one day, just put it in my pocket, with the cord tied to a belt loop. When I got off, the wallet was hanging by the cord and my 15 euros was gone. I think it would be a good idea to get a money belt that goes around the waist. We also noticed a lot of people begging, and this was evident throughout Rome. If we went to Rome again, I think I would give another hotel a try.", "Date": "June 18, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto, Ontrario", "Title": "\u201cperfect location, basic accomodation\u201d", "Author": "loulou21", "ReviewID": "UR3514100", "Content": "Loved the location, right accross from Termini railway station, close to grocery store, all of shopping....
