The location was further away from the centre then we first thought or would have liked. When we arrived back at the hotel, we were given the key to our room. The room (#25) was quite poor. There was a strong smell of them insense sticks which I dislike, I found stains on the bedding! The shower didn't work and leaked all water out of the pipe! And the stench from the bathroom was disgusting! Can't complain at the noise level as it is fairly noisy outside late into the night but this does not bother us! Exhausted, we slept but woke early in time for breakfast. Which was very much a dissapointment too! Dry ham & cheese was offered with bread, you can toast yourself, along with jam, peanust butter and Nutella.There was also 2 cakes available, neither of which we tasted. The Fresh Orange/Apple Juice & Coffee was the most appealing thing we had for breakfast there. We cheked out but left our bags there whilst we spent our last day exploring Amsterdam. When we returned for the bag there was another receptionist, and a rude lady she was. We left straight after asking for some cartons of milk for the coffee machine (2euro per cup) and being told there was none when there clearly was!!

In the night, we heard rodents scurrying around, evidenced by the fact that they gnawed through a cardboard box to get to a chocolate bar I had in my luggage. We were able to move rooms the next day, but this was probably worse. The third day, after drying off with a tiny face towel b/c there were no decent sized bath towels, I noticed something crawling on our bed. It was a bed bug! I found another one, killed them both and saved them in a plastic bag to present to the reception. Upon further inspection of the bed, I noticed several small bloodstains around the sides of the mattress, leading me to believe these weren't the only bed bugs in the place. We left and were refunded the portion of our stay that we didn't use. The rest of place was filthy. I don't know if it had been dusted in the last 10 years and the beds were all sunken in and uncomfortable. It's worth the extra money to not stay in this nasty hotel!

Location/Exterior. Location is good, just opposite the central station, great for trams, taxis, trains, canal tours and bike hire. Also really easy to walk into the very heart of old Amsterdam. On the down side, the road itself is very busy and traffic noise is high - you cant have it all. The exterior of the building is graffitti marked, which is sad as the building itself is old and very typical of the houses in the area. Check-in/out/service. The guy on duty when we checked in was very warm and friendly, he gave us a free map and showed us where the main area's of interest were, without being asked. Our room was still being cleaned when we arrived but he offered to keep our luggage safe behind his reception desk and asked us to come back. What a thoroughly nice man, we couldnt have asked for better. We were asked for a 10 euro deposit for the room key which was fully returned when we left. Check out was easy, hand in the key, collect your deposit and say goodbye. The only other member of staff we saw was a lady who wandered around between reception and the breakfast room smoking and leaving a trail of ash behind her. Breakfast. Bread/toast/cereals/meat/cheese/jam/coffee/orange & apple juice - nothing high quality, but adequate, fresh and plenty of it set in what was obviously once a very handsome room. Some stunning oil paintings - with water damage, beautiful chandeliers alas the whole thing was tired and in need of some love. One thing of note is that one resident had a large dog staying with him and the dog seemed really happy with the breakfast room - I'm a dog lover, but even I'm not too keen to share breakfast with dogs. Room. Ewwwwwwwwwww, yuk!!!! twin room with ensuite. The heating was on full blast - I mean it was like a sauna, unbearable.... but we found the radiator valve and turned it off, so no problem there. The room was at the front on the second floor, so high traffic noise - but hey, it's in a city not rural. The beds were very old - not antique just old and much used. The floor of the room sloped very badly so it felt like sleeping on the side of a hill. Wardrobe, TV and Desk very old, but they served their purpose - even though the slope on the floor meant the TV was on an accute angle!. Bed linen was laundered and fresh - no complaints there. Mattress old and worn - but no sign of creepy crawlies. The room was dust free and had been cleaned to a point. The room was severely in need of redecoration, since there were some dubious stains on the walls - squished bugs?? The bathroom has old fittings that are watermarked, no amount of scrubbing is going to bring them up shining. The shower head was broken and handing from a piece of string - but it worked. The tiled bathroom floor was damaged very badly and as such was not safe to walk in without shoes - I have to conclude that it is not safe to shower here because of the risk of cutting your feet on the broken floor tiles. One other word of caution - the stairs are precipitous, take ropes and climbing gear, in fairness, the stairs are not in poor repair and are not the worst I assailed whilst there. I wouldn't book for a return visit, my personal view is that if they spent less overheating the hotel and more on renovation/refurbishment then it would be a sweeter place to stay - so sad as this building was once lovely and has the potential to be so again.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Stoke-on-Trent, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cterrible hotel\u201d", "Author": "C0nners", "ReviewID": "UR120234160", "Content": "We had to change the room as the first one given was a dungeon.

They have no licence, so it's used to store luggage. The rooms have dirty walls and carpets, heaven knows what's hiding in the bathrooms and under the beds The furniture is broken and the mirror in our room was a wardrobe door leaning on the wall.

Also, half the time the water was cold, so not a very pleasant shower experience.

The mattress and the linen looks like dirty and much dusty: during the night you have difficult to breathe in. The ground are dirty too and i think that the cleanliness is not really done. The electric circuit is at high risk! *Bathroom: really small, with one washbasin and no window. The shower? Short! If you are more than 150 cm.... Water temperature is difficult to balance (broken faucet) *Breakfast: (low hygiene for me): you take all with your (dirty) hand. All you can eat. Bread, rusk, marmelade (3 types), butter, orange juice, water, coffe and tea. Oven to warm up your bread. We ask to have more orange juice but a girl who work here asked us it was finished....but we see it in the back of kitchen and when we exit from the breakfast room we see it on the table!! *Services: the night man receptionist is crazy. Generally the liking is not high. We had a problem but they did'nt resolve. *Other: our trip were horrible in this place! Worst place ever in 18 years of prowl! We hav'nt the light during the stay! No electricity for more than 24hr!! We use the bathroom with the lights of mobile phone. We ask them but none happends: no room change, no sales but only a torch was give to us....

The room was very, very basic - double bed, robe with just enough hanging space for 5 large jackets/coats and tv (the tv did have satellite so you could watch programs both in Dutch and English) and it had working heating in the room. Our room faced main the road and we didn't think that it was that noisy (I've read a few other reviews complaining about the excessive noise); just close your window and draw the curtains. We also had views of the Music Hall and I think NEMO (the Science Centre) was not too far from us as well. We also opted for breakfast which was pretty good - choice of bread, cheese, cereal, boiled eggs, coffee/tea/OJ and a selection of other tasty treats, well worth the extra 6euro from memory. Another thing to note is that there is NO lift/elevator in this building - our room was on the top floor - which was about 6 flights of stairs up - we would highly recommend purchasing a backpack if travelling through Europe as most of these older establishments do not have lifts and lugging a 20kg suitcase is not very fun at all. The hotel is old, probably in need of refurbishment very, very soon but despite this, it is well situated to all of the Attractions, in walking distance to the main train station. When you come out of the train station, walk straight out and look for the street ''PRINS HENDRIKKADE'' (it runs parrallel to the train station) - if you have your back to the train station, walk left on Prins Hendrikkade; it will about 10-15 minute walk from there. The room was priced right and had the basic amenities - I would only recommend to certain types of travellers, those not so interested in the 5 star treatment but rather, budget conscious. Amsterdam can be an expensive city ... there's a place called the Soup Kitchen on the street ''Nieuwendijk'' and they do great Sweet Potato soup and the Mushroom soup is great also, great to warm up your belly on those very cold Dutch nights.

We were a bit concerned with the amount of negative reviews, but decided to go ahead with the booking as surely it cant be that bad, and we had just arrived from Paris were we stayed in a absolutley acceptable cheap hotel complete with bar and patissere, so what really could go wrong? Well let me tell you what went wrong 'Y Boulevard' went wrong. Although close to all the essential things you need to do in amsterdam, please take my warning, this hotel is not for you if you crave things like, adequate acommodation, semi-friendly staff and being delivered wat you were promied (even haf-way is good). Grated this hotel is cheap, but cheap doesnt have to mean awful, for example on arrival after booking a double room (1 double bed) we were supplied with a room that contained two small single beds. This was a shock but decided to perservere due to the cheap price. Now that we had accepted our lot with this hotel, let me tell you what is really was like. Firstly, the room we stayed in had a noticable slant to the floor, enough for you to physically roll to the other side of the room during the night (in your bed ofcourse). Secondly, the bathroom was dirty, soiled and mouldy, not a great advertisement in anyone's langauage. Most importantly, bathroom had the constant smell of rancid sewerage to it. Granted it was winter, but the heating in our room was intolerable and not controllable by the tenant, luckily the window could be opened, which did afford us a great view of the harbour. We received complimentary continential breakfast with our room, sounds nice in practice, but the delivery was awful, stale cheese and ham, horrid filter coffee and not even fresh bread. Apart from the above, this hotel is in a great location, walking distance to where you want to be, but having met friends in Amsterdam who were paying just as much as we were, you can get a much better deal for the same amount of money than this.
