Breakfast is outstanding and much better than normal hotels in Rome. Lots of cut fresh fruit, cheese and cold cuts, cereals, youghurts, bread, croissants, pastries and much more. Staff in breakfast room is very nice and you hardly notice them but they work extremely efficient and quiet. Reception staff is very pleasant and helpful, especially Irene who helped us a lot and always with a warm smile. Our room was small but clean. Would have appreciated two chairs (now one of us had to sit on the bed). Bedside lamp does not give efficient light for reading. Pillows are very hard.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Wroclaw", "Title": "\u201cOK\u201d", "Author": "Pawel_EPWR", "ReviewID": "UR123649340", "Content": "Great location, two minute walk from campo di fiori.

A decent breakfast is included and they take credit cards: Bischione does neither. The position is excellent in terms of tourist attractions and my room was quiet (having requested that in advance). And it is fun (for a Brit) to have the French Embassy next door so that whenever one felt a bit depressed there was a reminder that there is always someone further down the scale. So nothing really special but clean and decent - at a reasonable price in central Rome terms.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas", "Title": "\u201cVery Quaint Hotel in Good Location\u201d", "Author": "Dallas51", "ReviewID": "UR121243810", "Content": "This is a very quaint hotel down a small street right off Piazza Farnese and just a 2 or 3 minute walk to Campo dei Fiori, which is great plaza with some good restaurants and lots of activity. The breakfast buffet is wonderful...lots of fresh fruits, tomatoes, meats, cheese,etc. Every morning there was something different on the buffet. The rooms are spacious and very quaint. Biggest disappointment was the uncertainty of the internet. There is only one terminal and the internet is very, very slow....only negative to this review. If you do not need access to the internet then this is the place. Would definitely stay here again due to location.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Duesseldorf", "Title": "\u201cOne of Rome' s best Locations\u201d", "Author": "PozzoDuesseldorf", "ReviewID": "UR120744836", "Content": "A very nice, small hotel in one of Rome' s best Locations, hidden in an ancient building, full of charme; you can reach most of the major attractions (i e.
