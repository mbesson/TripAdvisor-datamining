This Hotel is very conveniently located in Little India near the Farrer Park MRT and is very close to Mustafa Shopping Centre. This place caters to low budget travelers from India, Bangladesh and Srilanka, who perhaps dont mind the quality of the rooms as they prefer to roam around the city, or indulge in hours of shopping and who want home like food which is available in Little India and certainly dont want to spend time in the room. The room was small and dingy. Right from the reception to the lift, the corridors and the room, there is some pungent smell that one has to get used to. The bath area is too small and the wasbasin is unclean. The total toilet and bath area put together will not be more than 5X5 feet. The linens and bedsheets were yellow and pale and less said the better. In a nutshell this place is for hardcore budget travelers who dont mind compromising on the quality of accomodation. It is for those who prefer crashing on the bed in the room instead of collapsing on the road, after a hectic day's schedule. There is so much of a demand for these kind of hotels in Little India area as tourists want ''some place'' to sleep and really do not mind the quality. When I reached there be late evening the hotel was full and by night time I saw people sleeping on the benches as it seemed that all the hotels in the vicinity were full. If there is so much demand why at all the hotel management focus on quality. Their margins are made anyways. Therefore there is no concept called as quality, customer satisfaction, cleanliness etc. In a nutshell as long as they keep the pricing low they can have 100% occupancy for 365 days and make their money. Therefore if you fall in backpacker category or you are looking at a cheap vacation this hotel can be chosen.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cIf you have nowhere else to stay....\u201d", "Author": "AgataP", "ReviewID": "UR127961100", "Content": "Located in Little India, Singapore, a budget hotel which is not that cheap, anyway.

My dad said that he decided to splurge on a hotel since we were going to be staying for a while. Considering how much this hotel charged us, the experience had been absolutely horrendous. The hotel's location is convenient. It's like two somersaults away from Ferrer Park station so the taxi driver was able to locate it easily enough and the hotel has space to accommodate cars so it wasn't a hassle unloading our baggage. Across the street is a shopping mall and there are always taxis passing the area. The hotel lobby looks nice from the outside but small on the inside. There's a patio with vending machines in front where you can hang out or eat take away if you wanted. The hotel itself has a dining area in the basement where you can get free breakfast (they serve Indian food, just a heads-up for those who aren't fans). They have an elevator and an area where you can store your baggage if you can't check in yet or if you need to check out early. So, we're done with the good stuff; onward to the bad stuff. When we got to the lobby, we were drenched to the bone because it had been raining so hard. The receptionist (who looked fairly young) was eyeing us like we were messing up her precious lobby. She was unfriendly and dismissive. When we asked about activities we could do (we were told online that we could ask about tours and destinations ), she just stared at me and told me to get flyers. Plan your itinerary already because they aren't going to help you. We didn't even get a \"welcome\" or \"enjoy your stay\". We got a room on the 4th floor if I can recall correctly. The elevator is small, cramped, and rickety. It also smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in a while. When we got to the room, we were so disappointed because they looked nothing like the pictures.. The carpeted floor felt like it hadn't been vacuumed in ages, and the room smelled old and damp. The beds that they said could accommodate 4 were only for 3 people, even with the beds pushed together. The beds were also dirty (we had to brush off particles from the bedspread). The room was dusty, and small, and the AC stopped working properly after the first night. We woke up on the second day to find that our things were drenched from water dripping from the AC. They ignored our request to be transferred and didn't fix the AC after we reported it. We had to stash our things to one side of the room and catch the dripping water with a waste basket that would overflow. Room service sucks because they don't come at all when you call, and you actually have to take a trip to the lobby because our room phone was broken. The bathroom was super narrow, smelly, and disgusting. I never once stepped into that bathroom without slippers on because the floors were grimy. There is no floor partition for the shower area and the toilet, so everything gets drenched when you take a bath (no bathtubs either, if you're a fan of those). The separating door was stuck so we had to take a shower very carefully or else our things would get wet. At least the heater worked, but the water pressure was so weak and temperamental. No bathroom tissue or bidets, though thankfully the flush worked. The sink was gross and the tap hardly worked. No rods for placing wet towels nor baskets for placing bath things, just a broken shelf by the sink, and a metal shelf above the toilet that was covered in something grimy. No free shampoos or anything. No adapters, no internet (they said online that they had wi-fi, but they just had this one dinosaur of a computer that you could use for 2 SGD an hour). Breakfast is at 8 am, and I suggest you go early because there are a lot of people staying at the hotel and the basement dining area isn't big enough to seat everyone. The buffet's pretty decent and someone always comes out to refill the containers so the food never runs out, but they don't offer many selections (as previously said, only about three kinds of Indian food and some toast). They have juice and hot water is available if you want tea or coffee. The free breakfast was my favorite part of my stay here because my family and I were always able to eat a heavy breakfast before heading out. The baggage storage is terrible. It's just like a room with all sorts of things dumped in there (like broken chairs and broken frames) along with people's luggage. The room isn't even locked and anyone has access to it. You have to figure out how to fit your bags in with everyone else's because people literally just dump their things on top of one another's and then leave. Bag locks are your friends.

Before I begin the descriptive review, a bit about how it makes one feel. I am about 40 years of age, and at the peak of my career in which I have struggled to get where I am. I usually stay at Golden Landmark village when in Singapore. But for once, I impulsively decided to go for a budget hotel. The one good thing Claremont did for me is to remind me of my struggling days 20 years back, when I used to save every penny where I could. Hotels with small rooms with antique TVs, smelly carpets, musty grills indicating there might be an air conditioner behind them, washrooms that would easily make one prefer constipation than a visit to answer nature's call etc. Thanks to Claremont, I am back on earth from the 7th cloud, and my faith and devotion in God reposed- I hope he keeps me well paid enough to never return to my struggling days. The hotel. Almost forgot that amidst my nostalgia and prayers! The signboard above the hotel doesn't work, and the taxi drivers don't know where it is (unusual in Singapore, probably an offense), so be prepared to look for it. It is opposite Mustafa shopping center, by the way. The reception is worth less of a mention than the receptionist, who flatly refused the refund of advance tariff paid on the internet booking. I asked for the refund just by seeing the reception. Then the rickety lift to the room- I used it only once, and subsequently preferred the stairs to the 5th floor (I'm quite fit, actually). I did not quite want to be lifted to heaven yet- I'm only 40, remember? The room- oh no. I went down to the reception and pleaded for another room- the best they had, even at extra cost. Giving credit where due, I have to say she obliged promptly, without a smile. The next room did not have a smelly, wet carpet, and only the mixer/tap of the shower was missing in the bathroom, so I was overjoyed. After all, it was only a 1 night stay. I showered by sitting under the tap and turning about- luckily, I'm also reasonably flexible. If you are a gymnast or limbo skater, this style of taking a shower won't even bother you at all. Well, I slept. No bug bites. The complementary breakfast was in a basement we usually use for stowing trash/discarded items. The breakfast had an incredible choice (incredible as in the scary movie- 'The Incredible Melting Man', 1977)- instant noodles, bread (toaster is provided), jam, and Tang. There were other dishes I could not decipher- probably South Indian. There are some restaurants nearby. This hotel will suit that shady business traveler who will try to save a few quids at the cost of his comfort and happiness- another S$50/- will get you a hotel worth calling a hotel. Surprisingly, there were quite a few guests there. S$50/- can get a nice gift for your beloved from Mustafa! I will happily transfer 500 Airline miles to anyone who can tell me why the strict Singapore government has not demolished this hotel yet.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chennai", "Title": "\u201cExcellent Hospitality Showed At Claremont Hotel, Singapore\u201d", "Author": "Raja1978", "ReviewID": "UR106522685", "Content": "I stayed at Claremont Hotel in Singapore During the First week of June 2010 along with my aprents for 5 days.

We have stayed in budget hotels and backpackers so are not always looking for luxury - just a clean room and bathroom and helpful staff. The Claremont had none of those things. We were originally given a tiny room on the 3rd floor but due to renovations with a strong paint smell in the corridor I asked to move. We were moved to the 7th floor to a larger room but the phone didn't work, the bathroom light didn't work, the TV had a horrible hum on most channels, there was no mini bar - not that we needed one but there were dire warnings on the checkin sheet if you didn't tell the reception staff things were missing. And the window opened - isn't that illegal to have a window open on the 7th floor? When it rained the window leaked so badly that we had a pool of water on the floor that we had to mop up with the bath mat. The bathroom basin also leaked so we had to put the rubbish bin under that. The room wasn't serviced at all in the time we were there. The first day we were just getting up and about when the cleaners came through so we asked them to come back but they were determined they had to do something so they empied the rubbish bins. That was it for the two days. Coffee and tea making - they only provided packets of coffee and tea with milk powder added so we bought our own coffee and tea bags. And as for breakfast - we didn't bother. Just a visit to the basement was enough to put us off eating there. Twice people barged into the room because the receptionist had given them our room number instead of the floor below. That was interesting - especially as one time I was wandering round in my undies ... not a good look! Reception were useless. All requests were met with indifference and when I mentioned the light and phone for the second time they just said - tomorrow, tomorrow. At one stage I had to resort to ringing reception from my mobile in the room because a friend was coming to pick us up and she had tried to contact us but the receptionist just kept telling her our phone was busy. When I went downstairs to talk to her she was either on Facebook or chatting on her iPhone. Helpful - not! The final straw was the last day when my friend wasn't feeling too good so we requested a late checkout due to our late flight home and was told it would cost $50. I mentioned the leaks, lights etc and was directed to \"Miss Debbie\" who when I said about the lights and phone wanted to know when we'd reported it ... which time? I replied. ! So she gets on her mobile to call up maintenance and says she'll send someone up immediately. I said that wouldn't very helpful because my friend was asleep and not felling well. She was adamant and sure enough in about 10 minutes we had these two blokes come into the room and move the bed trying to fix the phone line. She did charge us $25 for the extra hours. I couldn't be bothered arguing - it was like talking to a brick wall. In fact she didn't even have the social skills to talk to me about the price but just yelled at the receptionist - \"it will be $25 for these people for the late check out.\" It was disappointing end to a great holiday but you live and learn.

The mrt was very close and had us connected throughout the city. The morning breakfast was a little sad as the food,did not contain any fruits. We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends who want just basic amenities with a tight budget in hand.

Read reviews - but looked at photos and thought it must be exaggerated. Wrong..... In fairness, the room had a safe, airconditioning, comfortable bed, shower that worked fine, television - basically all that we needed for a one night stay. BUT...... the hotel itself, corrididors, general decor etc was appalling. Paper off walls, damp, and although the room adequate - just about - the walls and curtains etc all needed a good scrub. The breakfast room had a dreadful smell on the approach, and is not geared at all to europeans. Was happy with the bread, eggs and jam - but a toaster would have made all the difference. The staff at reception were not overly helpful - but the hotel did seem to be very full, (although I don't understand why). We had only paid \u00a336 a room (get what you pay for comes to mind....). However - a couple of days before I thought at that price it would be a good idea to book another night even though we were flying at midnight, just for convenience. We didn't do it because the costs were coming up at \u00a390 per night - I would have been fuming it I'd paid that. As it turned out this hotel couldn't offer late check out so walked round corner - to equally poor hotel following day - and booked in there to just enable us to dump cases for the day and have shower at end of day. AS we were a party of four this worked out fine. However - our friends room at Clarmont was larger than ours - but dirtier - the cobwebs were hanging profusely around the room. It served purpose as a one night stop over - but I would not really recommend it at all. Also - not just this hotel - but with the kettle provided, packets of all in one coffee drink provided - ie dried coffee, milk and sugar - not the best for those of us who drink black coffee, no sugar..

We'd reserved a family room from their website without checking out reviews first, so naturally we became very apprehensive after reading these reviews and ratings. They'd told us early checkin was possible but not guaranteed - it depended on room availability. So we'd also made plan Bs - like taking shower in one of the Changi Airport lounges. We landed in Singapore early morning around 7 AM and called them up from the airport. Luckily a family room was available, allowing us early check-in. The hotel is just 1 road away from Ferrer Park MRT station on the NE line. We reached the hotel comfortably and checked out the room. They charged SGD50 for early check-in, but gave us breakfast for all 5 people inspite of early check-in. Breakfast was a typical American breakfast with some local touches like chicken samosa (which was rather rubbery but edible). All in all, acceptable for the 4 veggies in our group too. If you want to stick to Indian food, there's a good restaurant (Komala) just across the road. Mustafa Shopping Centre is right across the hotel. Our room was on the 7th floor. Nothing particularly bad about it actually. Since we were on a hurried trip of 2 days, we wouldn't be spending much time in the hotel room anyways. After reading so many bad reviews, my guess is that the family rooms are a better deal than other room types. Room has electric kettle and tea powder to make tea. Only 2 electric sockets were there (one for TV, the other one free) and none were near the beds. Hot showers and bath was available in the bathroom. Info for the fussy ones: sofas were a bit stained. TV remote was not working. The bath tub was supported by tiles, so a standing shower was a bit of a balancing act. Beds are quite comfortable. One friend did complain of some biting, but the remaining 4 of us felt nothing and woke up just fine with all organs intact, so no worries there. AC was slightly noisy. Next day, we checked-out by noon but our departure from Singapore was only at 7 PM evening. So the hotel's free baggage room proved useful for us. However, it's a common store room and anybody's allowed access, so be careful if you're keeping something valuable in there. Overall, I'd say it's no Hyatt :D but then again, you're paying just SGD 183 (133 in case no early check-in) for a family room; for that price, it's not a bad room.

On arrival, we were told that there were some problems with the air conditioning system of the family room. Therefore, they will be relocated to another hotel called Aspinal, which is 5 minutes walk away. We were made to wait approximately 30-40 minutes before the shuttle arrived to transfer us over. Arriving in Aspinal, we were made to wait for another ~30 minutes before getting our keys to the room. The room in this hotel is simply dirty. The whole floor was damp (i'm not sure where did the water come from), no carpet, wooden flooring and this made the room smelly. One side of the bed is broken and is merely being supported by a wooden stick. Upon pulling up the blanket, i discovered that the bedsheet only covered half of the bed. The other half is left uncovered!!!!! The lights were dim and the paint on the wall was peeling. When I requested for a room change at the reception, the receptionist inform me that there were no other rooms available in a couldn't-be-bothered attitide. He wasn't helpful to mend the situation. In the end, I had to request for towels to be put on the wet floor. That was the first night. On the second day, i requested to be transfered back to Claremont hotel due to the terrible room condition in Aspinal. Receptionist in Aspinal was rude. Acted as if she is doing be a favour for a place to stay. She informed me that the room will be ready in Claremont at 10-->10:30 am. There were no shuttle to transfer us back to Claremont. It was drizzling and I had to drag all the luggages all the way back. Upon arriving the room was not ready. Apparently they were not inform. So we had to wait for another 30 minutes before we could check in. The room is not as dirty and smelly as compared to Aspinal. However, the ceiling in the corridor to the room was leaking. And there were pails along the corridor for the leak! There were also cockroaches in the room.

I will never be recomending this hotel or aspinal to any one. Added is lousy room , cleanliness and they won't even take an intl. call and make a note and give to us when we are away. LOUSY PLACE.

My companion and I were fully aware that it is a budget hotel and so we did not expect much. We were going to stay there mostly in the evenings and we intended it to be a place to rest and sleep after a long day of sight-seeing and shopping in Singapore. I booked a triple room and we were given a room with 1 double bed and 1 single bed. I had expected it to be 2 twin beds and a fold-away mat because that was what was written in my booking confirmation. So the double bed and the single bed was a welcome surprise. The room is spacious enough for us to move around and it uses a key-card lock. It has a big window that open up to a vacant lawn space at the back of the hotel. We had unobstructed views of other buildings from afar. Apart from the usual small fridge and TV that comes with almost every hotel room, there are also an electric kettle, mugs, glasses, spoons, tea, coffee, and sugar sachets. The beds are just the right size for us (we are about 5 feet 4 inches tall) and so for anyone taller, I can imagine some difficulties in adjusting to the length of the beds. The aircon takes a little while to cool the room, maybe 20 to 30 minutes. The aircon vents have rusts and need cleaning. There is a lingering but tolerable musky odor in the bathroom. Once you have showered and used some fragrant shampoo, the odor disappears. We are provided with clean towels for each day we stayed there. Hand soap in a dispenser is provided near the sink. Body wash soap, also in a dispenser, is also provided in the shower stall. A roll of tissue is also provided. However, there are no toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, shave, and other toiletries one might expect. Fortunately, we came prepared in the event that these things are not provided so we brought our own. The shower stall is narrow but it fits us just right and so, again, just like the case of the bed, for anyone bigger or taller, I can imagine some difficulties in taking a shower. Breakfast is from 8AM to 10:30AM. It is a buffet breakfast and it is at the basement of the hotel. There are tea, coffee, and sugar sachets, butter and bread which can be toasted using the toaster provided, juice, cereals, milk, noodles, rice, empanada, soup, and eggs. On our first morning, we came down at about 5 minutes before 10AM and had expected little food left. We were glad though when we saw still plenty of food instead. The entrance to the Farrer Park MRT stations is just a leisurely 1.5-minute walk from the hotel. The actual location of the trains is about 3 minutes away from the entrance. The hotel is facing the Serangoon Road where many cars and buses pass by. On the other side of the road, infront of the hotel is the Serangoon Plaza. Most taxi drivers are not familiar with the hotel name and so it helps to mention the Serangoon Plaza, which is well-known in Little India, as a landmark. There is also a taxi stand infront of Serangoon Plaza. We had an early flight back home so when we checked out, it was about 4:30 in the morning. We were able to hail a taxi in less than 30 seconds and it took just about 15 minutes to reach the airport. It also took us about 15 minutes to reach the hotel from the airport. I would recommend this hotel for anyone who is budget conscious and looking for an easily accessible place and would not be staying in the hotel the whole day. One can not really place their standards so high for a budget hotel like this. Just expect the barest minimum and be happy with the extra perks that come along.", "Date": "August 29, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Claremont Hotel Singapore", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d309922-Reviews-Claremont_Hotel_Singapore-Singapore.html", "Price": "$72 - $112*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">301 Serangoon Road</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Little India</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Singapore</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">218224</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Singapore</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "309922", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/2e/c2/2ec24c3c1e0f63062ad6e7fc93a440704large.jpg"}}
