It is a little difficult to reach the center if you don't have a car, i mean that it takes long, otherwise the bus stop is right outside the hotel.

Just next door to the complex there is a very good \"Tavola calda\" you can even order your food and it will be ready for lunch time, your morning cappuccino there is a very nice bar just around the corner!

When talking the reception doesn\u2019t even try to look at me, she talked arrogantly while doing her work, for me, it is so rude, especially when you are in the hotel business. My personal opinion, there\u2019s no family spirit in the hotel. They refuse to answer the call (I made more than 5 calls), I\u2019m so angry and I went to the desk to check, there they were there with no customer, I\u2019m still wondering why they didn\u2019t answer. The internet is so slow, I made so many complaint but still nothing was done. Location wise, its near to the airport, took about 30minues to the airport and they provide shuttle service (in advance). Going to Rome is quite a challenge here, you can took the bus (only running from 6.30am to 8pm) to the nearest metro station, and the bus journey took you about 45 minutes.

I must respectfully disagree. First, with the idea of staying the last night in Rome prior to an early departure, since the uncertainty of a $50 taxi ride in traffic adds an unecessary knot to your stomach. Second, with the idea that there are no good hotels near the airport. We just got back from a trip to Italy and had rental cars with us. We stayed at the Best Western I Triangoli (http://www.romehotel-itriangoli.it/) for 100 Euros per night. The hotel was newly-built, had enclosed, locked, free parking, had free wifi, free breakfast buffet, and was a 15 minute drive to the airport, where we dropped off our cars. There is a gas station 100 yards from the hotel where we filled up prior to returning our cars. This place is highly recommended for those driving cars and/or having early morning departures where minimal variables are desired. My only caveat is that the airport has non-existent signs directing you to the rental car return. You have to loop inside the airport in a tightening spiral, into the \"Arrival\" area, with no signage until the end. But if you're returning a rental car and flying out in the morning from Rome, this hotel is the one.

The breakfast selection was among the best we had seen on our trip. The hotel is perfectly situated within a 20 min drive of the airport, although be warned that if you are heading out on a weekday morning, the rush hour traffic makes it closer to a 1.5 hour drive.
