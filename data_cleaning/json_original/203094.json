Even the \"Leader of the Opposition\" who is at times somewhat fanatical about cleanliness gave it a white-gloved thumbs up. First the room: Decent size with comfortable, king-size bed. Large wardrobe with plenty of hanging space. Good size bathroom with bathtub and bidet. Desk, armchair and of course air-con to keep us warm during our Christmas stay. Service: Extraordinary. We checked in at just after 8:00 a.m. and were admitted to our room on the 5th \"piano\". (Gotta love that language!) And it just got better. At our first breakfast we were staring querulously at the all-in-one coffee dispenser when one of the white coats approached, \"Cappuccino, signora e signore?\" We gratefully refused and wondered wether a couple of espressos might be possible. \"Si, certo.\" Within a minute 2 cups of delightful Italian espresso appeared on our table. Then a second, and a third. Thereafter, each morning as we entered the restaurant for our ante-meridial repast, the ever delightful Fabrizio would, without being asked, deliver two espressos to our table. And, noting that we had finished our meal would return with two more. Made us feel special. Location: Ideal. As others have noted it's just a ten or fifteen minute walk to the Colosseum - or for the ambulatorily challenged a 2 minute train ride on the Metro. And once you reach the Colosseum time doesn't matter. You lose yourself in the wonder of the place. Cross the road and follow the Via Dei Fori Imperiali along side the Foro Romano toward the Piazza Del Campidoglio. Priceless and timeless. And still there's more. Exit the Hotel and turn left. Turn left again into Via Manzoni. About three doors down you'll come to an amazing \"alimentari\" or deli'. This is the best place in Rome. Dive in and marvel at the selection of \"fromagi\" and salami. Try the pitted, marinated green olives and the sun-dried tomatoes. And before leaving grab a bottle of chianti - about 6 Euros. Sensational. But there's more! Exit the hotel and turn right. About 50 metres up the road you'll come to a little wine shop. Go in and talk to the old guy who runs the place. Ask him to recommend a bottle of \"vino rosso\" or \"chianti\". He'll talk to you enthusiastically and point out various bottles. You won't understand a word he says but you'll know exactly what he means and you'll leave with a bottle of Chianti classico for about 8 Euros. Just a a wonderful experience. Once you are suitably provisioned, scurry back to the hotel, go to the bar and press the call button. Within moment a charming and helpful waiter will appear. Ask if you might borrow a couple of wine glasses and perhaps a plate or two to take back to your room. Of course, this will be no trouble at all and you'll probably be offered knives, forks etc. They are just nice people. So, yes, try the Hotel President.

I've been to Rome a few times before and this hotel is probably the best one I've stayed so far. It's no Marriott and it's small -- but unless you're willing to pay a couple of hundred dollars a night for a hotel room, this hotel should serve your needs... The hotel rooms, by European/Roman standard, is actually quite nice and has all the basic necessities. My side of the hotel was very quiet and I had no noisy neighbors. Some people from my group however who were on the street side of the hotel complained about police and ambulance noises every 15 minutes (perhaps the hotel can install sound proof windows?) -- although this is not something we can fault the hotel -- it's just Rome! Perhaps the biggest complaint I got from the adults and teens alike were the noises from the other guests -- there were several student groups and the days we were there, a group of Mexican girls were uncontrollable and extremely disrespectful of the other guests. Our chaperones and some of our teens complained to the front desk and the people at the desk were very rude to them. This was unnecessary. As the group leader and chaperone myself, I know that if a guest complained about one of my kids, i would have reprimanded them and dealt with their lack of courtesy. The hotel staff should have contacted their chaperones or adult leaders and demanded that the situation be addressed. And as I've said, the rudeness of the receptionist to our adults and kids was completely unnecessary... we're not blaming the staff for the problem, but they do not need to be rude. I was also told that when one of my kids asked for an access code for the internet from the front desk person, he was told \"I already gave you one!\" Again, be a little professional. Even though they are kids they paid good money to stay in your hotel. No need to be irritated. Most of the staff however were very respectful and kind -- the kitchen staff were very accommodating to our group since we had a couple of people with dietary restrictions. I want to thank them personally for their good service. Most of the staff on the front desk were very kind and helpful. The accessibility of the hotel bar with drinks and food is also good especially if you want late snacks... The location of the hotel is excellent -- the metro is literally outside the hotel entrance and has access to all the major sites, there are a few stores and restaurants close by for evening walks and to purchase things, and it's about a 15 minute walk to the Coloseum where there are other good places to eat and shop. If you're traveling with a group or even on your own -- this hotel is not a bad place to stay. It's clean, decent, and has many pluses. Again, consider that most of the complaints from my group were beyond the hotel's control -- except that they could have handled certain things differently and the rudeness of some of the front desk staff was completely unnecessary. Most of the staff were helpful and courteous -- some people from my group had some problems and requests and they took care of it immediately -- safe getting jammed, getting stuck in the elevator, etc -- kudos to the maintenance crew.

I am writing regarding a recent stay at your hotel on 20th \u2013 23rd May 2007. We have stayed at many Best Westerns throughout the UK and New York. The standard of the bedroom we had and the hotel in general was very good. However I can honestly say that the restaurant was the worst we have ever encountered in ANY hotel. The staff in the restaurant were very rude, not only to us but to other guests entering the restaurant. We booked half board accommodation and on the first night we asked at reception regarding the evening meal. The gentleman on reception didn\u2019t speak much English but told us we had to go in with the group, we told him we were not with a group, we had booked individually, he didn\u2019t seem to understand so another gentlemen intervened, he said I will take you through to the restaurant and we were met by the waiter. He showed us our table near the door and we ordered two drinks, he said \u201cLasagne\u201d, not a question, but a statement. We said OK, but what we got was pasta and cheese sauce, quite frankly I have seen better microwave meals! Even another waiter asked me what I was eating and I told him they said Lasagne, he said it doesn\u2019t look like that to me. Anyway, the next course got better, one pork chop, burnt green beans and four soggy croquette potatoes. I said I didn\u2019t want a sweet and the waiter offered fruit salad. He then brought me a dish full of fruit that had seen better days and threw a knife at me. Whilst we were eating our meal the staff were more concerned with fussing round the coach parties that were in at the same time and we seemed to be an inconvenience to them. The reception staff asked us about the meal and we said it was not very good at all. They told us it would be better the next night. When we came in the following afternoon we asked at reception about the choice as stated in your hotel service directory which says \u201cyou can choose from the a la carte menu, the days menu or the Mediterranean menu\u201d. We were told that there was no choice but they would allow us to have pork chop or veal or a combination of both. When we went down for the meal we were given for starters pasta in tomato sauce, to be quite honest I think tinned pasta may have been better! We were asked what we wanted for the main course and we both said veal. I asked for salad and my wife asked for vegetables. When it arrived we had three pieces of veal in an insipid sauce and were both given two plates of lettuce \u2013 one variety only. They asked us if we wanted a sweet and we said no and left. We again complained at reception and said that we would be eating out the following night, as we completely thought that enough was enough. When we went out for our evening the following night at 7.45pm we noted that the restaurant was in darkness! I note that your hotel services directory states that \u201cyou have the advantage of staying at individually run hotels with the benefit of strict quality standards certified every year by independent inspectors\u201d. I do not think this is the case here! I feel that some sort of recompense should be made to us as we would never ever have booked half board if we had known the standard, and to be quite honest the whole episode ruined the stay.", "Date": "June 2, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chesterfield", "Title": "\u201cNot bad for the price\u201d", "Author": "aliChesterfield", "ReviewID": "UR6849387", "Content": "We stayed from 23rd to 26th Feb 2007.

Being a Best Western (UK) employee for a number of years I was surprised that the breakfast standards here were so poor as Best Western do have above average standards when rating hotels. The President claims to be a 4 star hotel, but in my opinion would struggle to gain 3 stars in the UK. The hotel itself is very well located, the reception, bar, restaurant and rooms clean and tidy, the staff are great but the noisy rooms and poor food lets it down.", "Date": "July 5, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Kuwait", "Title": "\u201cAverage stay\u201d", "Author": "casalinda", "ReviewID": "UR3604840", "Content": "We stayed for two nights at the end of our vacation in Italy. We booked two-connecting non-smoking rooms. The rooms they gave us were the most pitiful looking thread-bare noisy rooms in the hotel. Our room smelled like an ash-tray but they said they could not move us because they were full. So I asked for the bedsrpeads to be replaced because they were filthy and smelled horrible. The front desk said \"no\" because they were fully booked. I then asked for an extra top bedsheet, but was told \"no\" because they were fully booked. So we went to bed to try to sleep but the A/C went off around 1:30 in the morning and it got very hot in our room. When we contacted the front desk, we were told that the A/C is always shut off for 6 hours at night. After that night we were ready to move to another hotel. However, the manager came and apologized for all the problems and wanted us to move to another room. So we moved. The room they gave us was large, clean and actually rather pretty. This makes me wonder why we were put in that awful room in the first place. The front desk was helpful even though they had limited English ability. I know that I would never stay at this hotel again. The location was terrible and I would not feel safe walking around in that area at night. They did provide a free basic breakfast, the staff was friendly and helpful, but it is only one of those places to stay if you have no other options.", "Date": "June 22, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGood 4 star hotel for average tourist\u201d", "Author": "Thomson_aus", "ReviewID": "UR3344874", "Content": "This is a very comfortable 4 star hotel for the average tourist.

We heard people snoring, having baths/showers and full conversations as if the people were in the room with us. The room service each day was minimal. Some of the breakfast staff were very rude too.

We had a king size, bed, a pull out couch, t.v. with remote, a small refrigerator, a key pad safe, large bathroom with a hairdryer that worked. The room was very clean. The hotel caters to groups so it was noisy sometimes. There is a metro stop right in front of the hotel, and it was a 10 minute walk to the Collesium- and two stops from the main train station. I did not feel unsafe in this area. Don't eat any meals except breakfast in the hotel- food was terrible and service was so so. Breakfast was cereal, meat, cheese, pastries, eggs, and canned sausages. Coffee was from a machine. Juice was ok. You can get plenty of coldwater. The staff was very helpful-others in our group didn't think so-- but I thought they were great especially with the number of groups staying at the hotel at the time-they even made reservations for me to tour the Vatican.
