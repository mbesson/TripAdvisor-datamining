The location is fantastic - - less than 5 minutes' walk to the \"Born\" area, which is one of the trendiest parts of Barcelona in the Old City, with tons of bars, cafes and shops. You also have a big park across the street for walking/jogging, and you can walk to the city's main beach in 15 minutes. It was 80 euros for a double which is extremely good value. Old reviews here talk about an elevator under repair but that is no longer a problem. It is a basic hotel but the staff were friendly and helpful (e.g. they let us store our jamon serrano in their small staff fridge overnight, before we took our flight, as their is no fridge in the room). The bathroom is nice and modern. Stay here if you plan to explore the city, not hang out in your room a lot.

We expected a basic small hotel room for 70 a night, but we got a horrible, dirty & really noisy room. Lots of hair everywhere I dont think they clean the floor (or anything else!), the pillows where yellow (yuk!) and the room smelled of cleaning product (i think they just spray it hoping it will magically clean the room!) Also I never been in a hotel where you hear the front bell so loudly throughout the night ,cant they put the noise lower, plus its not like we where next to the reception, we were at the end of the hall! Also I was woking up several times in the night by a loud drilling noise which turned out to be the coffee machine. In top of it all the elevator did not work, so several floors of stairs with our luggage (fun!). The location is the only good thing here!

It was a small room, to say the least. We maybe had a foot on either side of the bed, so you either had to be in the bathroom or in the bed. The view from our window was of a brick wall that was about 2 feet away, obviously letting no natural light in. The little TV only had a few stations and were Spanish speaking only. The construction next door was always a pleasant awakening, even on a Saturday. As for the staff, there were some nice and some not, and some were English speaking, which was good. We never got any clean towels or a room cleaning for a 6 nights stay. We saw a sign about their credit card machine not working a few days into our stay, and were relieved when it wasn't there a few days before we left, but when we went to check out, she brought out the sign again. (Is that anyway to run a hotel business? shouldn't that be a priority to fix??) She pointed us to an ATM, expecting us to pay with only cash for a weeks stay. Apparently they've never heard of a daily withdrawl limit. Seemed like a pretty big tourist scam to me. Our saving grace was the WiFi cafe right next door. I'd recommend getting a hostel with a private bath, it would probably be nicer and cheaper.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cBarcelona\u201d", "Author": "UdiAussie", "ReviewID": "UR18464360", "Content": "Location is a 10min walk from the Barcelona Nord bus station, so was very convenient for us as we got there late at night.

Dont let first looks put you off. When you arrive it looks like you are going into a block of flats. The hotel is in fact on 1 floor for a very large building. You have to go up 2 fligths of stairs or use the very old fashioned lift. The hotel is has vey Mondern decor and is equipt with a vending machine for drinks and snacks. I found the hotel staff very friendly and could not be more happy to help. The rooms. Walking past some of the rooms they are all diffrent sizes. We had a rather large room wich was very clean and had a TV saftey deposit box and a luvley shower and bathroom. The walls are rather tin though and you can hear everything going on in the hotel. I would not say its noisy there but if you are a light sleeper might not be the best idea. The area was good there were some nice restaurant and cafes on the walk to the centre which are a lot cheaper than eating in all the tourist places. It takes about a 15 min walk to the main street. All in all we enjoyed our stay and would recoment this hotel for a short city break.

We were prepared for small and basic, since we were looking in the budget range. But the Triunfo was extremely noisy (particularly the ancient elevator), incredibly cramped (it was difficult for both of us to stand in the room at the same time, unless one of us was standing right next to the window - essentially, one of us had to be sitting on the bed at all times), dark, not terribly clean, and not terribly hospitable. They also said at the outset that they took credit cards, and then reneged. The rooms do not \"all\" have balconies overlooking the Parc Ciutadella, as promised. Ours had a window looking into an internal chute of some kind -so we kept the shade down. The location was OK, but not ideal. We ended up in this hotel only because we were staying for more than a week and every other hotel we tried was booked during part of that time.
