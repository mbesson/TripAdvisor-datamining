We only stayed 1night while waiting to board our cruise. From what I could see, the hotel in not within walking distance of anything you would like to see. There was one very small restaurant 1/2 block away. The wait was too long so we opted to order a pizza in the room. ---One more negative and then I'll get to the positives. There is a 7-11 type convenience store next to the hotel. We stopped in to pick up bottled water. The store was open, but the door was locked - we had to get buzzed-in. Just guessing here, but I think that speaks volumes to the character of the neighborhood! You also need to get buzzed-in to the Ciqala too. --Even though Ciqala is new, it already had graffiti on the face of the bldg. --Now, for the pluses: the receptionist was very friendly and offered us an upgrade without our asking. We were given a resident apartment - 3 bedrooms, 2 full baths (one with jacuzzi), full service kitchen - the apt was very lovely and sparkling clean. --A full breakfast is included with the room rate. -- Other than the location being a bit questionable, I do recommend the Ciqala for a visit to SJ.", "Date": "March 14, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "St. Thomas", "Title": "\u201cWe didn't want to leave!\u201d", "Author": "Jadyn M", "ReviewID": "UR125896356", "Content": "This place was excellent for a bigger group. 6 of us stayed in one of the bigger suites and it was a perfect setting.

We booked a 3 bedroom condo for a night at the beginning and end of our cruise with Ciqala. When we checked they decided to add about 150-155 dollars of additional cost. The reservation for stated the cost was based on 2 but our reservation was based on 6. The refused to budge and since we got there late at night we were unable to travel elsewhere. They advised other people had had this problem too but they were not responsible. As for the property itself. It was very out of the way, far from the beach, far from restaurant selection, and in a less than desirable neighborhood. Our room overlooked abandoned buildings and trash. It appears in the pictures it was recently remodeled. It was, but with poor workmanship. We cancelled our second night stay and moved over to the Holiday Inn Express in Condado for 150 dollars cheaper and were so happy we did. Holiday Inn was good lodging. Close to open stores, food, and beach was right across the street. Awesome. We would stay at the Holiday Inn again.

The hotel is conveniently located next to a 24 hour express shop which is well priced for emergency snacks and drinks. Very little hotels in today\u2019s economy take the time to please customers.
