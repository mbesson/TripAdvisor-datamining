Not a good sign for a 4 star hotel. Room was oke with 2 big beds and a nice bathroom. But what is lacking is this hotel is warmth and charm. It doesnt feel like anyone reealy cares who works there. No information at all in your room. Not about Madrid, not about the swimmingpool, the route to the metro etc. Breaffast was just as lifeless. Everything was there, but just white toast bread and no fresh cakes etc. In Spain almost everywhere you have free wifi, but here you had to pay (which I didn't do). Oke people who stay for their work, maybe do not care if it is free or not, but why you still have to pay for wifi in 2012?? No, I will not return to this hotel. we had a great rate, so that made our stay worthwile but if I would have paid the full price, I would have not be very happy.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201cGood for business traveling\u201d", "Author": "fjuka", "ReviewID": "UR129460073", "Content": "It's a little bit too far from the city centre (about 30 min from SOL). The hotel is in the walking distance to the metro (10 min) but you are to go uphill and it's not too easy with the luggage. If you travel light it doesn't matter. It easy to get to the airport and to Chamartin train station by metro. Just across the street from the hotel there's a supermarket (doesn't work on Sundays). The surroundings are quiet and green. I stayed in the hotel twice. Both times the rooms looked great and were clean but... had only one set of shower gel, shampoo, soap and one glass for bathroom (the room was double!). Two different glasses in the room (suppose they don't have similar ones...). Only one set of towels (when I asked they gave me the other one). You can see bathing robes on the hotel photos - we didn't have any. Also the presence of kitchenette is mentioned in the description of the hotel but it is only in some rooms (the second time I stayed in such room), it includes microwave, heating panel, sink a fridge, but no houseware (plates, cups, spoons or anything else) so it doesn't make any sense. Another odd thing is the door-window leading outside from the bathroom to some technical compartment outdoors (!), so it was rather cold in the bathroom even if that door was closed. The soundproofing is bad! Sometimes I had an impression that someone is taking a shower in by bathroom :) The staff is not very helpful: when we ask how to get to Toledo the man at the reception gave us wrong directions, so don't count on them. I'm not sure if I'd recommend this hotel: the price is good for Madrid (I paid 60 euro per night for double), but it is far from centre and there's nothing special about the hotel, so your choice depends on your plans.", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "PA", "Title": "\u201cA business hotel in a nice neighborhood\u201d", "Author": "artseaman", "ReviewID": "UR126226864", "Content": "This is out of the way, a kilometer to the Metro.

We went to & from the airport on the Metro - pretty straightforward if you do your research first on which lines to use. Reception staff on all occasions were friendly and helpful, and spoke English. The rooms are reasonably spacious, new and clean. I'm over 6ft in height so the beds were too short, but I get that pretty much anywhere we stay. Breakfast was tasty and a good variety.

On the negative side, where do I start? On arrival, the check in took a long time. The hotel itself is nicely presented in a modern fashion. We ordered a twin room but were actually given a double. We did not complain about this as we thought it would be the only problem. We then discovered the room had only been set for one person, despite the fact our check in details clearly stated there were two of us. There were no details about the hotel in the room and the only thing there was a magazine about various places in Madrid. We could see the swimming pool from our room but had absolutely no idea how to get to it! After working through the maze of the hotel, we found the pool! We asked various members of staff about where to go in Madrid and what the best sites were. In the day time, the reception staff were very rude and did not seem concerned about our inquiry and brushed us off. The night porter was the friendliest member of staff who gave us a map and pointed out good places. On our last night, we decided to check out the cocktail bar upstairs. The doors were open and the lights were on but there was no bar man. What looked like a handy man then rang down to reception who told us the bar was not open and we had to go for a drink downstairs. When we went downstairs, we were seated with no option as to where we would like to sit and given the same cocktail menu as the one we had seen upstairs. For some odd reason, the cocktails were more expensive downstairs and when we asked about this, we were brushed off again. We waited for roughly half an hour for our drinks order to be taken and then a further half an hour for the drinks. We then decided to go outside for a cigarette. There were diners on one side, and the other side was empty and so we decided to go away from the diners, thinking they would not like our smoke whilst they were eating! A waiter came out and told us to move immediately, in a very rude tone, as the tables were reserved for diners, although there were only one table eating (the guys we moved away from!) We went back inside and what we assume was the manager then told us we could go back outside and sit on the table we were on! After one drink, we were sick of being treated badly and left the bar. So, if you want to go to a clean hotel and not socialise with staff - this is the place to go.

We quite liked that you just take a train from the Pinar de Chamartin (5-10 min walk from the hotel) and get to Sol without changing the train. For a 4stars hotel the rooms are pretty small and \"all in black design\" is pretty depressing. The bed was superb, very comfortable and the mattress hard and solid. The bathroom was great with designer facilities. And we totally LOVED massive 40\" plasma TV set. The staff was alright but we did not have to communicate much with them and we did not have any problems, in fact. We did not go for a breakfast as we were on a tight budget so we went to the supermarket instead which was 100 m from the hotel.

All the staff I encountered were not very friendly or helpful. The walls of the hotel are too thin; I could hear almost every word of the people next door and the noise from the room above made it impossible to sleep. The photos of the hotel show a garden area, there is no such thing. The pool is surrounded by a small waterlogged grass area with no plants, chairs or loungers (or anything!) only a fence separating it from the hotel and an office building both towering above you on three sides. There is no bar or lounge area just a very expensive restaurant that closes very early. There is nothing in the surrounding area of interest just high rise apartments. The wi-fi is very slow and not free. No double beds just singles pushed together. The floor mat in our room curled at the edges so tripped you up every time you walked over it (not a major point but while I am on a rant..!) A balcony would have been nice.

It's located in the Northern part of the city, close to Chamartin station. It's well connected with the impressive Madrid's motorway (M30 and M40) and metro (closest station at 10 min. on foot) network. Good location if you have something to do in this part of the city or you just want a place to spend the night, but avoid it if you are a tourist looking for the typical Madrid's landmarks. In that case there are lots of better options close to the historical center. I have seen works inside the hotel for a long time. They seem to be refurbishing the rooms, giving them a modern appealing appearance. In some cases they are so modern that they lose functionality, but in general it has been a good idea. Rooms are big, extremely clean and have a small kitchen. Staff is usually friendly and competent, especially one of the guys. Fares used to be a great deal some years ago (when there was no metro connection), but they aren't any longer. Still, they usually are the lowest in the area (around \u20ac80-\u20ac100), not a bad price since there are no cheap hotels in this area. I had a very bad experience with their fire alarm, with doesn't seems to be well adjusted. It sounded at night while I was sleeping. After calling reception, they told me it happened because a customer had burnt some food in the small kitchen. I thought I just had bad luck but 2 weeks later it happened again at 2AM. Again, reception blamed a customer for wrongly cooking something (at 2AM??).
