First of all the room we booked was SMALL. It had one queen bed, an itty bitty bathroom, a desk, mini fridge and closet, all shoved into a really tight space. I felt like while we were in the room, there was no privacy for either of us, whether we wanted it or not. The view from the room was the top of a shorter side of the hotel which was quite honestly gross to look at. When we walked into the room it was hot, the air had not been running at all. The next morning when we woke up (at about 7am) there was absolutely no hot water. For us, it really wasn't a huge deal since we weren't planning on leaving to see the city yet, but it was a work day and there were business men staying in the hotel as well. They clearly did not get a hot shower that morning - I'm sure they didn't leave happy! We aren't sure if the hot water is a typical problem for them or not, but just beware! They had it fixed and HOT within 2-3 hours, but the whole ordeal was a pain. The included breakfast is nothing to get excited about...but at least it was something! Parking is in the lot across the street...I think it was $14/day (self-park in a lot just for Clarion guests). Felt safe leaving our car there.

This work may not yet be complete as we noticed that one of the elevators was decorated in a New Orleans style whilst the other was simply dark wood requiring redecoration. Continental breakfast was included. It had a reasonable selection of food and my only criticism was that there were not enough tables at busy times.

There is a business center off the lobby that I did not use but which appeared to be suitably equipped. The fitness suite on floor 2 was reasonably well equipped. The hotel is right on Canal Street with a trolley stop outside. The reception staff provided change when asked and told us about buying a day pass ($3) rather than individual journey tickets ($1.25), very good advice. I read some of the other reviews and have to disagree with several points raised: I noticed no trash or odors anywhere and thought the property was in fairly good condition and well maintained. The staff did appear busy (maybe it is understaffed in these difficult times) but always courteous and helpful (making change, giving trolley advice and calling a cab etc.). There is a single step at the front door on Canal Street, it is highlighted with yellow paint and warning signage. It really should cause very little obstruction to a roller bag. However, for larger bags, strollers, wheelchairs etc., there is another door on Saratoga Street (directly opposite the parking lot and 30/40 yards from the front door). It features two ramps and there is clear signage at the front door identifying its existence and location, you'd have to be blind or asleep to miss it!

I pull up my sleeves and my arm was so red and I couldn't believe it! There were bite marks all over the place.

First, the good ... it's within walking distance of both the French Quarter and Bouron St. as well as the Superdome, so a good location as far as proximity goes. We were happy with the room set up ... basically a suite with a seperate bedroom and living area. The bed was comfortable. The living area had a kichenette, which was convenient, and the entire suite seemed clean from what I could tell. We noticed no bugs at all, which have been mentioned in other reviews, so perhaps that problem has been remedied. A complimentary breakfast comes with the room and it's pretty tasty with a good variety of both hot and cold items. Before I mention the cons, I want to say we were at this hotel on a very busy weekend. It was not only spring break, but there was a basketball tournament in town so lots of people and I'm sure the hotel was booked to capacity. However we were dissapointed with a few things. We arrived on a Fri. evening at 7pm and there was no self-parking available and no attendant at the valet parking. We were fortunate to find a luggage cart to get our luggage up to the room, as there is no staff available for that, either. A valet finally showed up and we learned that there are only a couple of dozen on-site parking spots for this 16 story hotel, so the vast majority of guests have to use the valet off-site parking, which they charge $22 a day for. The off site parking is a block from the hotel, so it takes a good 10 min. each time the valet's have to park a car, or get your car for you, and longer if others are also waiting. Our daughter waited 30 min. to get her car when we checked out, as others were checking out at the same time. Our other main complaint was that at breakfast both mornings they ran out of food and there were long lines of guests waiting for the food to arrive (it's catered from somewhere else in New Orleans, so when they run out, it has to be brought in from another location). They were usually out of coffee as well. The food was good, but try to go to breakfast very early to get a full meal without waiting. Another concern was the neighborhood that this hotel is located in. It's on the far north end of the french quarter, more in the business district I think, and there are a number of street people around the hotel at night. At night you see them urinating on the buildings and sidewalks nearby and they may ask for money as you pass by them. We were uncomfortable walking back to the hotel after dark, although we did it both nights we were there. Another problem on the weekend were were there was that there are only 2 elevator for the entire hotel, and as I said, it's a 16 story building, so we usually waited 5 min. each time we used the elevator, and in the mornings when we went to breakfast we waited 10 min. So all in all, if you don't mind waiting (for breakfast, the elevator, and the valet), ... and if you don't mind walking a few blocks through a not-so-good area at night, then I think this hotel would be fine.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lafayette, Louisiana", "Title": "\u201cNot Again\u201d", "Author": "Devon S", "ReviewID": "UR125404464", "Content": "We stayed here because of a child that needed treatment at a local hospital.

First, I gave them the the benefit of the doubt when I arrived with a confirmation in hand and they told me they had given my room away. (This was due to their error keying in the wrong credit card # I found out). No apology. The hotel crammed six of us in a single bed room for the night and promised our larger room the next night. Of course they made our party ck out at 11 of that room the next morning and wait until 3:00 that afternoon to ck into the new room. No help was offered or received for the transfer. The hotel then began to randomly charge our credit and debit cards. (over $1000) When we went to the front desk, they simply denied this was happening until we printed out bank statements to prove it! The debit charges were so much that caused overdrafts and guests without cash. Couldn't get anything from guest services, so the General Manager was asked to help. Totally incompetent, rude, and just did not want to be bothered with his duties. Again, not accepting any fault or an apology. Called housekeeping to ask for additional rollaway, including blankets, pillows, etc. Not going to happen. If they knocked to clean at 7:30-8:00 and you were sleeping, you got skipped until they next day. They did, however, let us have a couple of extra little bottles of shampoo from the cart, since there were six of us. Thanks. The front desk day clerks were the rudest and most uncooperative I have encountered. Mardi Gras is a busy time, but there is still a job to be done and customer service should still be a priority. The General Manager, however, just needs to get into a new line of work. It has taken three more days to clear up the overcharges. Not worth the trouble, even for the location, there are much better choices. We did have beds, a room with a door and a bathroom, but the inconvenience, no maid service, extra bedding, and billing errors that were quite questionable, along with a staff that lacks any sort of professionalism, is just not acceptable.

It was within walking distance to the French Quarter and very fairly priced for being right there in town in New Orleans. It's on the same street as the Ritz-Carllton and other big name hotles and seriously less than half the price. It's walking distance to the river front with sites like the Aquarium of the America's and other family type entertainment. New Orleans is a very old city, and with the hurricanes of past years there are a lot of run down areas in the city, but this is true of all urban settings, But I felt very safe in this location. There is a very nice marble lobby with columns and high ceilings, leather couches and an area with tables and a TV where they serve the continetal breakfast in the mornings, and front desk that is manned 24/7 to keep any unwanted folks out!! Our room was small as is common in older hotels in big cities (but much bigger than european hotel rooms) and did not feel tight or confining. It had been recently updated and the decor was tasteful. The room had a nice secure heavy door, and a small but nice kitchenette that was set aside from the main part of the room with a small fridge, sink, coffee maker, and cabinets with dishes and cutlery. The room over looked the city streets, but was not noisy at all, and there was self parking right across a quiet little side street for just $14 a day, or you could opt for the \"garage\" parking that was $20 a day, but the self parking across the street was easy and by far much more convienant for us. The bathroom was nice also with white marlbled walls and floors and a jetted tub, that is great for relaxing at night if you've been walking all day around the french quarter and your feet and legs are tired. We were there in June and it was terribley HOT, and the A/C was great in the hotel...both in our room and in the lobby (such a treat to get back to the hotel after walking in the heat for hours). We only paid $90 a night, plus the $14 a day for parking which wasn't bad, considering we were being charged $77 a night for a flea bag (well known chain hotel) in Slidell, La. which was a good 20 minute ride to the city...and we had no working A/C and couldn't even get toilet paper at this \"Priceline\" special hotel.......plus we got a free breakfast at the Clarion.....but you must get there early. We came down at around 8AM and it was still plentiful, but there was np place to sit.....all in all very pleased for $20 more bucks a night!!", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Gray, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cBetter than reviews\u201d", "Author": "fetwstephens", "ReviewID": "UR124983047", "Content": "I had read numerous reviews online and had my doubts about staying in this hotel.

The room had a coffee pot and kitchen and everything was located within walking distance. The parade came by right out the front door, all we had to do was fix a drink and go outside and watch it. The breakfast was very good and the eggs and grits were the best I have ever had and I am from Georgia and we do grits a lot here. The only disappointment I had with this hotel was the staff was not very friendly and the \"service elevators\" did not work. The maids should have been using the service elevators with their carts as well as people trying to get their luggage up and down. This hotel has 16 floors and if you are up on the one of the higher floors you do not want to take the steps, so you have a terrible time trying to use the elevators if the maids have their carts in there. I understand it is Mardi Gras week and a very busy time however, if the service elevators were working the people would be able to move around and not spend so much unneccassary time waiting for the only two working slow elevators in the whole place! Then each time we needed something or had to ask the desk, they acted as if we were bothering them. I know Mardi Gras is a hectic time but I thought they should know that and be more prepared.

Had to get moved from my 15th floor (great view) room the first night as the internet access was flawed there - as verified by the guy at 1-800 number that did a great job of trying to get me online. Internet after that was reliable but slow. Frig froze and destroyed all my drinks and there was no control know anywhere to adjust it. Breakfast is fine if you like lots of sugar carbs and starchy things. The raisin bran was reliable but the only protein available was hard boiled eggs that could not easily be peeled. Came down one morning at 8:55 and lady doing breakfast told me it was too late to refill the hot stuff even though she conceded that the posted time of breakfast was until 9:30.

I stay in New Orleans at least once a month on business and have stayed at a lot of hotels around the French Quarter. This place was the worst by far of all my experiences over the last 5 years. First off they offer valet parking, but when I arrived at noon they told me their parking was full and I was on my own to find parking... In the French Quarter... In ann unsecured location. The strange thing is the claim check in is at 4pm and check out is at 11am... How could they be out of parking when guests had checked out an hour before. What this tells me is they simply do not have enough parking to accomidate all their guests and know this. So they did let me check in at 3pm, an hour early after I spent 2 1/2 hours trying to park my car, 4 blocks from the hotel in an area I was sure my car nor it's contents would be there in the morning. I went to the room and took off my shoes to unwind when my socks got soaking wet. First off I would not walk around in the room without socks. The floors just looked like they had not seen a real cleaning other than a vacuum run over them in 20 years. So I went to the front desk an spoke to the gentleman there. He was of no help and acted like he did not understand what I was talking about. So I asked for the supervisor who told me the Hotel was full and they could not move me. After a long amount of time begging the said they could upgrade me to a suite for an increased charge!!! They just told me there were no other rooms, they were completely booked. And the gaul to charg me when the room I was in obviously had an issue. So instead of fighting with them I paid the increase and went to my room. As far as suites go this was not terrible though there were no towels, no toilet paper and the bathroom looked like someone washed their dog in there. The cleaning staff was not up to par with even a Super 8.

They have valet parking for $22 but it's two blocks away and not covered so we elected to pay $14 for self parking right on the next corner. Advice: Park and walk because the employees park in those spots! We liked it because we could see our vehicle from our hotel room. They only have 2 elevators and they are very small. We took the stairs to the 4th floor a few times because we never mind using the stairs. We had a very nice room with 2 double beds. Room is not too big but it was functional with two large teenagers. The bathroom was HUGE and very clean. Free Wi-Fi for my IPad and free HBO. There were people coming in and out of the elevator on our floor at all hours of the night and they were loud! We've stayed in several hotels in NO and they were all noisy!!! You learn to just sleep through it. We went down for breakfast on Sat morning looking for our cereal, bagels and fruit. They had grits... tater tots... old fashioned sausage links, cut in 1\" pieces... hot eggs.... and biscuits.... along with the cereal and fruit. Haven't had that at the other hotels we stayed at in NO. We walked to the French Quarter on Fri and Sat which was right down the street. \"Beware\" we walked down on the Clarion side of the street and there are undesirable people just hanging out during the day and night. We walked through some very strong marijuana smoke coming back to the hotel. It's New Orleans, there's people hanging out everywhere. They won't bother you if you don't bother them. Since we had teenagers we just walked on the OTHER side of Canal. I usually don't provide reviews but I felt compelled to write up this place. We have plans to stay at this location everytime we come to New Orleans due to it's in walking distance to the French Quarter and Superdome.

After reading the reviews we figured it seemed decent enough for crashing at while we attended Voodoo fest. The rooms are decent and seem to be kept clean by staff although they are SMALL...our queen room had a shower that looked like it came out of a camper. Whoever did the \"renovation\" on the room we were in must have been hired from underneath a bridge...the wallpaper, molding, caulking, cabinets were laughable at best...but really not an issue for us as we just wanted a place to catch ZZZs. I had read about the slow elevators and I can attest to that as we were on the 10th floor and actually had to walk the stairs one morning for breakfast because one of the only two elevators was out of commission. I'm rambling...so the reason I rated this place so poorly and would NEVER go here again is the acoustics. The hallway outside of the rooms are tiled. This combined with heavy steel doors that close automatically makes for a very NOISY experience. In a city like New Orleans where people come and go at all hours of the day and night, you don't want common areas that amplify sound. We could literally hear every conversation of people waiting for the elevator and the elevator was around the corner and 50 feet away! We also were lucky enough to be on the floor where the cleaning staff and maintenance guys had their daily watercooler conversation! Combine this with the fact that the hotel is on the \"fringes\" so there is constant Police siren activity outside all hours of the night and it is nearly impossible to sleep for more than an hour straight...unless you are the type of person who can sleep through a bomb.

Hotel Itself: We had a room on one of the upper floors w/ one Queen Bed. The room was an OK size - adequate space for suitcases, closet space was good. It even had a small kitchen counter top and sink - allowing us to make our own sandwiches etc. There is also some cabinet space above the kitchen counter area to store any non-perishable foods. The TV was an Older - CRT - type unit that had poor sound quality - and limited channels as well. The bathroom was clean and hot water worked great. The Shower had great water pressure and excellent hot water. This was NOT a full bath/shower...just a standing shower - like in a locker room. The problem here was that the drain was not properly designed. Instead of making the drain lower than the rest of the floor, it was higher - so all the water does NOT go down...instead it goes to the edges of the shower. It did not affect us too much though. Good heating (especially since it was petty cold that weekend in town), quite street - even though we faced Canal Street. During the day, there were a lot of ambulances going up and down Canal - but this seemed to quiet down more at night. Our main issue was that on Sat nite, guests down the hall kept going in and out of their rooms - slamming the doors shut. This was hard to sleep thru. It was much quieter on Sun/Mon/Tue nites. Location: The location was great. Only about 10 mins walk to the French Quarter and about 15-20 mins to the Waterfront/Casino area. We drove here, so we could get out of the main drag and see other parts of the city and had better eating choices. Or you could jump on a street car if you prefer ( we did). Parking: They have a lot down the street - about 30 yards from the front door - where you can park your car outside - in a gated facility - for an extra fee. Front Desk; Very helpful and polite people. If they did not know the answer to a question, they would look it up on line, print stuff out and hand us maps etc. Wifi connection- Decent in the rooms. Neighborhood - It's fine during the day, but at night, they have some 'strange' characters loitering around the area.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new york", "Title": "\u201cGood Stay\u201d", "Author": "dog4life360", "ReviewID": "UR53130661", "Content": "Locations: Excellent (one corner a little shady, but its New Orleans!).
