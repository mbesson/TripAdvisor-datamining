We stayed here once on Thursday night. The room was much bigger than the other 3 budget hotels we stayed at in Geylang. The place is budget, no frills, but despite its location (more later) it was very quiet and the interior of the hotel was satisfactory. The location is right down the street from central Geylang, although the hotel is about 2 blocks from Geylang road and between the road and the hotel are about 40--50 brothels. So if you are coming to Geylang for ... then you won't find a better location. Since we didn't come to Geylang for ... but rather we came because its the only place in Singapore that you can find a room for less than $70 US per night, we weren't very happy with the location compared to quieter lorongs in Geylang. My girlfriend was quite uncomfortable walking down the road, esp. since the denizens seemed to assume she was a working girl. Since we were together we were not harassed but I expect if either of us walked alone we would have been solicited. On the weekends it is probably much ...busier. The wifi costs 5S$ per 2 hours or 10S$ per 10 hours, and at this hotel it was a bit slow but otherwise satisfactory (except for the price). For budget minded people, there is an excellent internet cafe around the corner on Geylang road (walk to Geylang rd, turn right) for 1.80S$ per hour. Overall, I would stay here again if Fragrance - Pearl was booked. Also, check out Fragrance - Sapphire if you like swankier rooms but don't mind noise at 4am. Avoid Hotel 81 - Orchid like the plague (or roaches in this case).", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Singapore, Singapore", "Title": "\u201cBasic hotel, but acceptable\u201d", "Author": "BarcaBoys", "ReviewID": "UR60900304", "Content": "I'll keep this short, starting with the Pros: It only cost \u00a327 per night. The room was of a decent size. Check in was fast and efficient. No need for any deposit which surprised me. It is about 10 minute walk from the MRT station (Aljunied). Plenty of local shops and really cheap outside eating places nearby. Very vibrant and mixed area. Fast Wifi for a surcharge (2 hours for 50 SGD, 10 hours for 10 SGD, 24 hours for 18 SGD). Cons: It is right in the heart of the red light district. The brothels are designed like petrol forecourt shops, and there do not appear to be doors so I had the misfortune of seeing a soaked woman in a bath towel with a fat Chinese guy handing her a wad of cash. Something you really dont want your kids to see. Bathroom had decent shower and bath and was quite large. Came with TV. Aljunied MTR station is directly linked with the airport. I was on the 7th floor where it was pretty quiet. Generally a very clean hotel. Daily cleaning. The pillows were comfy but you only get a thin sheet and one of those brown prickly blankets. The air con was big for the size of the room and was positioned directly in front of the bed meaning that even on the lowest setting you will feel very cold. You then try and change the setting in the middle of the night and it's too hot, etc. One or two tiny flies around on the wall. Cant be helped in this location I guess. The area is a little run down and some of those local shops smell bad. As with all these local type areas, it is difficult to walk on the pavement because of the fruit and veg boxes etc. No room service. No safe. Take all your valuables with you just for peace of mind, though Singapore is a very safe place. Although they give free coffee/tea sachets, there is no kettle. Need to go out to the corridor for that. Overall, for the price it's good option. The bed was fine, just the blankets a little uncomfortable and the air con poorly positioned. But if you have kids, best not to come here because of the brothels, there are loads and loads of them, and sometimes the pimps call out to you. On one day I saw a Police car speed up and officers chase some kids as well. However, I still recommend it for the price and for single travellers who want to save the cash on other things in Singapore.", "Date": "April 10, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Toronto", "Title": "\u201cSketchy location, but decent stay\u201d", "Author": "goingmyway74", "ReviewID": "UR60228902", "Content": "I spent 2 nights here and didn't mind it.

Took the shuttle bus for S$9 one way, very cheap and advisable as cabs are likely to be more expensive. Arrived at hotel at 6pm. Check in was swift with friendly faces and without any glitches. Room was on the 7th floor as per request. It was small but adequate for solo traveller or couple but no more. It was impeccably clean, muted colour scheme, odour free with no insects and clean pressed bed linen. Toilet was a spacious combined wash area (common in asia), shower with sink and toilet. Towels were provided. No toiletries are provided. There was a toothbrush in a draw in the room but no toothpaste. Only snag about the wash room, there is no mirror. Shaving became a problem! otherwise fully tiled and impeccably clean. Room equipped with large 24\" TV offering 20 channels and hairdryer with sockets for shavers. No kettle available however, on each floor there is a hot water dispenser. A flask is provided in the room to store hot water for hot drinks. Complimentary 2x small water bottles with coffee powder (containing milk whitener) and mugs provided and replenished daily. No sugar or milk. Air conditioning was working perfectly, the most important piece of kit in room! Double bed was little hard but sleepable with thin blanket and no such duvet. There is not much room to walk around nor is there any designated area to put your luggage. I left it on my bed. The floor is clean. There is a small hanging cupboard to hang suits but hangar does not accommodate trousers! Not a huge inconvenience. There is a phone with few uk sockets handy for cam or mobile charging. There was a window facing the city which was a plus. I was awake till late and did not encounter any noise at all. Very peaceful. The hotel has room cleaning services and give complimentary water. They also offer wake up calls which I tried out and they were spot on. The check out time is 12pm but I managed to delay it till 12.30pm! Beware, the hotel does offer laundery services, but it takes two days! I left mine till last minute so purchased a new shirt for my suit not ideal! The hotel has a pay coin phone in the reception as well as a drinks and water bottle dispenser. The hotel is situated in the Geylang district which is a approximately 12mins away from City Hall, the main City centre SMRT (singapore underground) interchange. This district is home to the malay population. Up the road from the hotel there are many local alfresco type local eateries. Also on corner of the road there is a handy petrol station with the famous 7/11 store, ideal for buying snacks. There are many other local shops around for food/drinks/fruit & veg convenience shops with also an internet cafe close by very cheap at just S$2 an hour! Hotel Location is not ideal but it is close from the Changi Intl airport. On the same mrt line it is about 5 stops away about 15mins. The closest mrt station to the hotel is , Aljunied approx 10-15mins walk. It will cost you S$2.50 to get to City Hallby mrt, but you will get S$1 dollar deposit back. Walking from hotel to Aljunied mrt can be exhausting as I found out in the unbearable heat with direct sun rays! Drink lots of water to hydrate yourselves. It is good exercise and good to expose yourself to heat once in a while helps to detox! The hotel is situated in the red light zone with brothels in close proximity to the hotel. Only paying guests in the hotel are permitted with sex workers clearly prohibited which gives you an element of safety. The hotel is safe. I noticed the hotel had many international English/European/ US travellers which gives you that extra reassurance of the hotel being safe and secure. Outside you wil see girls on the street corners and they do not approach you. Have red many reviews by fellow travellers. I turned a blind eye to this all. It really is not bad at all. There is a bus stop on the corner of the road which can also take you to all parts of the city. Am not sure whether hotel has internet access or wifi check their website at: www.fragrancehotel.com. The hotel has a chain in singapore with approx 6-10hotels. I bought a daily tourist passfor the mrt valid till 11.30pm on the very day and can be used on all public transport for s$8 with a S$10dollar deposit which you get back when you return your card and this can also be done at the airport. I stayed at the hotel for 5nights for around \u00a323 per night. This is fantastic value for money considering hotels are so expensive in Singapore. Would definately adivse if you are a budget/solo/back packer/couple on budget. I bought back a take away one night but they forgot to put a spoon in. I rang housekeeping but was informed hotel did not have a spoon! I laughed. Only other snag was that when I left the room and took the room key (card form) it deactivated all the power in the room (normal hotel practise). After returning from the heat the room itself was roasted... By the time i switched the AC on and jumped into shower the room temperature became much cooler! One thing I advise is that you do not take a taxi in Sing between 5pm - 730pm as they charge extra 35% for peak hour use. Also be aware that if you book taxi for airport from hotel there is a hefty charge. I got a cab from hotel to Aljunied mrt station at S$7 and then jumped onto the mrt to Changi Airport using the tourist pass and then got my S$10 refund at the airport. My return flight was in the evening about 11pmon Sept 4th 09. I had checked out at 12pm and they have a handy secure luggage room where they stored it. Having been out in the heat I wanted to change clothes prior to leaving for the airport. Ideally I wanted to shower but this was not possible. But when I requested to use the toilet in the reception to change, I discovered the toilet was a wash room combined! I was ECSTATIC and had a permanent smile etched on my face! I asked reception staff to let me shower. At first they were hesistant but then allowed me to. I asked them for a towel which I finally got after haggling. They wanted to charge for 2hrs room charge! I convinced them otherwise as I had spent the last 5nights there! Had a shower and was refresehed, clean and ready to depart for the airport. Remember to ask to use the toilet. The shower facility was by far the best as I was concerned about getting to the airport all sticky and uncomfortable! Sneak a towel into the toilet. It is far from the reception so they cannot hear any noise whatsoever! Overall, I had a pleasant hassle free stay. The hotel most importantly is safe and very clean at the same time it has the required basic amenities . The room is comfortable and ideal for travellers/couple or business people who do not intend to spend much time in the room. The Hotel is 1* However, it by far exceeds that. Do not expect 5* service and comfort from this hotel as you will be disappointed. It is a fantastic Hotel in its own right! Enjoy your stay here! I would deifnately recommend this room to all my friends and colleagues! If you want further clarity by all means contact me! TIP If you need a shower (if you were unable to have one at your hotel) at the airport there is a facility at Changi Intl airport at Terminal 1. Once you checked in and gone through immigration go up the escalator it is sign posted swimming pool. It is opened from 7am - 11pm.It costs S$13.91 about \u00a36. There is a plush swimming pool with jacuzzi, showers with bar/tables with chairs / loungers and changing facilites overlooking the aircraft stands. Truly spectacular and paradise for any keen plane enthusiast. Well worth the price and great way to relax prior to your flight. Who needs premium business class lounges?

We arrived at night and noticed the establishments on the same road looked like brothels, however the street itself was clean and quiet, there were many residential buildings in the vicinity, shops and local restaurants and food halls were full of local people going about their daily business, and as a female I definitely felt safe. The hotel was basic but adequate for the price (remember you're in Singapore, not in Bangkok - things cost more here): common areas were clean; bedroom was cleaned every day; bathroom was of the 'wetroom' variety, as is very common in SE Asia; A/C worked perfectly; we had quiet nights with no noise and no problems. Staff were all very nice, friendly and helpful, giving us information on transport and local shopping. I always use my own toiletries even when I stay in 5* hotels, so I didn't even notice if the shampoo etc was there or not. Location is halfway between the airport and 'downtown' Singapore, a 10-minute walk from the MRT station through an evening market catering to locals. Walk to the end of the street and you get lots of very frequent buses going downtown. We had great food in one of the Chinese restaurants near the station and the foodhalls were good. I think that if you are mildly adventurous, on a moderate budget but want something better than a hostel, if you intend to be out all day visiting places and just need a decent place to sleep, this hotel is just fine.
