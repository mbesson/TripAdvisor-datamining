Although we live in San Diego, we wanted to sleep somewhere else to celebrate our anniversary and this was the perfect place! The property is very unique and has undergone extensive restorations that make it lovely. We stayed in the Balboa room which was very large, elegantly appointed and distinctly victorian. It had a king sized bed that was very comfortable but it seems the mattress might need replacing soon, as I thought I sensed a bit of a sag in the middle. We had a private balcony off the room which was a great place to sit in the morning. I found the bathroom, while charming with its pedestal sink and clawfoot tub, to be a little small. With there being no counter to place toiletries, it was a little challenging to get ready for our evening out. And while I'm sure bathing in a claw foot tub would be quite a unique experience, showering was challenging because it's so compact. There was also an unpleasant odor in the bathroom but I didn't mention it to the innkeepers since we stayed only one night. The room was very quiet expect for the occasional plane flying over in the morning since this area is below the flight path for the airport. That being said, it's also in a great location because it's close to all of the great restaurants in Banker's Hill and downtown. The room was also very dark in the morning due to the blackout curtains, which I loved. I enjoyed the evening wine and cheese reception and it's touches like this that make staying in B&Bs so worth it! In addition to serving great wines, it was nice to chat with other guests staying at the B&B. There was a tray of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies always available in the parlor which was great as well.. The grounds are beautiful and taking breakfast on the front porch was absolutely lovely. My husband brought a bottle of champagne so that we could enjoy it with breakfast and the staff had no problem chilling it for us. We both enjoyed the breakfast that was served; a scone and fresh berries, fresh orange juice, an omelet for him and eggs for me. I wasn't offere tea but would've liked some because I start all of my days with a cup of it. I'm not sure if they don't offer it in general or just didn't offer it to me. Check in and check out went smoothly and they even extended our checkout time until 1:00 which allowed us to enjoy a leisurely morning. Overall, I would recommend the property for a unique getaway, though it is a bit pricey.", "Date": "March 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Irvine, California", "Title": "\u201cAmazing antiques\u201d", "Author": "Karimark_12", "ReviewID": "UR126693301", "Content": "We LOVE Britt Scripps.

The breakfast was very nice, served in the dining or living room; -starting with good coffee, fresh baked muffin or scone, berries and cream, followed by your choice of two egg entree's of the day and a homemade granola/yogurt option. The evening wine and cheese is offered, self service, from nice trays in the home's elegant small living room. There was no one playing the piano, ever, during our two night stay over Valentines weekend. The recorded music played in the common areas and during breakfast is \"standards\" muzak... Not too offensive, familiar, but gentle classical would have been an improvement. There is parking available for 3 cars, one behind the other, in the driveway to the carriage house and street parking on busy downtown streets.

There is the most beautiful two story stained glass window next to the stairwell. The main floor includes an inviting living room, a large foyer, a breakfast room, and a kitchen and a couple of guest rooms. The second floor has all guest rooms. I stayed in two rooms: the Balboa and the Renaissance. Each are included in the deluxe category and are the largest in the Inn. The Balboa was the original master suite and includes a large bedroom and bathroom, with plenty of storage and a balcony. It was tastefully decorated and had terrific light. My only complaint was that there was no rim or table in the bathroom to put your soap comfortably when taking a bath in the large soaking tub. The Renaissance room was even prettier, but a tad smaller. While the bathroom was smaller, it was actually better laid out. My only complaint with this room was that the lighting was a bit dim. I found the Inn very quiet. You could get to Old Town in 5 minutes, the airport in 10 minutes and walk to Balboa park and nice eating places. I thought the breakfasts were lovely. A bottle of Voss water was included in the room. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.

I am vegetarian and had a choice of two meals on the menu. I chose an egg dish that was listed as containing only sun dried tomatoes and cheese. When I took a bite, I tasted meat. I spit it out and asked the proprietor if the dish contained meat. She assured me that I was just tasting the sun-dried tomatoes which she described as having a meaty texture. She did offer to verify this with the chef. When she returned, she notified me that my egg dish contained a turkey sausage.

It's an old Victorian that was in very good condition. The location was perfect for the Zoo, museums, and the hot, trendy restaurants. Their breakfast was great, fresh baked scones or muffins to start, followed by a choice of 3 entrees. The dining room had 3 tables (and they have 9 rooms) so you may have to wait until a table is free, but we had no problem. They have wine and cheese from 5-7 PM in the parlor. Classical music plays in the background at all times. Overall, it was very pleasant and relaxing. Parking was no problem. When you check in they give you a parking pass for a lot that is kitty corner to the hotel. The hostess was very nice and very helpful with restaurant and other tourist tips. The room was nice (we stayed in the Balboa room). Ladies, if you don't want to wash your hair every time you take a shower, bring your own shower cap. Also there was no clock in the room. That can be a pro or a con depending on your point of view. The linens were very nice and there's a down comforter on the bed. The biggest issue for me was that the bed itself was way too soft. There was a down pillow top on top of the mattress. I could not get comfortable, my back was killing me and I got virtually no sleep. If it weren't for my aching back I'd go back there in a flash. One final Expedia warning... if you book a room through Expedia, and request a king size bed THEY CAN NOT GUARANTEE THAT FOR YOU. Expedia told me they could guarantee a King bed, but when I got the confirmation it was listed as a \"request.\" The owner at the Britt Scripps was nice enough to honor my request, but he didn't have to. At the Expedia rate the hotel normally puts you in the lower priced rooms, and saves the bigger rooms for full paying guests.

We returned earlier than the check-in time such that the Carriage House had not been cleaned yet. The staff at Britt Scripps accommodated us; housekeeping cleaned the Carriage House promptly. This was impressive. The Carriage House is not Victorian. It resembles a country home. It is as small as the room we had in the main house. However, it was enjoyable because it was more private/secluded. The windows really made it feel like a small cottage. The house has a private porch in front. The Carriage House was very safe and quiet at night, despite its proximity to the street. The breakfast was very delicious. The chef had no problems altering the menu to cater to our vegetarian palates. Her muffins and scones were the best I have ever tasted.

Romantic, well-appointed, friendly and casual. Some might expect staff to be ever-present, but for those who desire only a place to hide away and enjoy, this is the place. not a bit of street noise, even though it's on a busy street, it has an accommodating staff, even if they are not 'right there' to help (and I'm one who would prefer to find them, not find them at my door waiting for something). The rooms are wonderful. Ours had a lovely balcony overlooking the garden, where late at night we could sip champagne in comfort and privacy. Very romantic for my new bride and I. Our sleep was wonderful. The bed luxurious, the room appointments lavish (even if the room is smaller, to be expected in a very old building), while everything had and updated feel (such as the bathroom, heater, etc). No noise bothered us, we slept right through the morning rush hour. The breakfast, very delicious. They grow some of their herbs on-site, making the simple, yet delicious, fare even more so. Again, service is attentive, and when we were greeted by Eileen in the morning, she was part of this wonderful Victorian experience. For those who want different than the 'normal', for those who want romantic, to be let be to feel the ambience, for those who are not.... cookie-cutter types, I certainly recommend this beautiful place. If you're the sort who needs parking services, who needs someone right there to make sure you have a clean towel (after you've used three), or someone who simply needs your every need met, this might not be for you. But..... If you're the sort who loves.... beauty, romance, interesting, different.... Try this one.

I had been searching for quite some time for a hotel where I could check in early and get ready for our wedding. I found a great price on orbitz and I called the Inn directly and they matched it. They put us in the Carriage House, which is the old garage turned into a little cottage. The Carriage house is absolutely adorable, and couldn't have been more perfect. It's not very large - but it was perfect for us. It's decorated so cute and the finishes are actually quite top-notch. The sheets were some ridiculously high thread count, I kept saying to my husband \"we have to find some of these sheets for home.\" I think the bed was the most comfortable I've ever had at a hotel. The inside of the main house is absolutely gorgeous, though we didn't spend but maybe ten minutes there. We sat out on the front porch for the included breakfast. They ended up taking so long to bring us our food, we had somewhere to be and didn't get to eat. But the coffee and the scones were absolutely delicious - I imagine the breakfast would have been too. It didn't really bother us because by that point we were full anyway. I highly recommend Britt Scripps and am so pleased that we found such a wonderful place to stay for our big day.

Parking is just the driveway behind the house; 1-2 cars max and in single-file. \"wine and cheese\" reception in afternoons was 'small'.

Our bathroom was in style with a claw-tub and a towel warmer. We received a bottle of Voss water and chocolates on our pillows. The lights in the bedroom can be dimmed to be very romantic! The butler staff is courtousy and helpful. They can give recommendations, maps, and coupons to just about anything you'd want to do in San Diego. The breakfast is scrumptious with hot strong coffee, a fresh warm scone, and homemade omelets or pancakes. The house it self it historical and elegant. There is a large stained glass window along the stair case, with a baby grand piano stationed below. The stair case banister is original (along with most of the wood work). The butler staff is there to answer questions you may have and to explain the history of the house. Our first night there, my husband and I walked across Balboa Park to the Prado restaurant.
