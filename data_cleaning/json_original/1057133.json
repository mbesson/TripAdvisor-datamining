{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Convenient to Duomo Hotel in very convenient location to Duomo, but a little off the beaten path of most hotels in Florence. This is a family run operation. Father and Mother very kind but do not speak English. Two daughters work there and speak English very well. Hotel was clean and room was spacious. Bring your own shampoo and don't expect a lot of little bottles you are used to at the chain hotels. Hotel was very accommodating on changing number of nights of our stay. There is no elevator and so you must carry suitcases up the steps. Daughter at front desk booked tour for us and had breakfast available 1/2 hour earlier than stated so we could eat before our tour. We walked all over Florence from hotel and there is a little pastry shop between hotel and Duomo which was very good.", "Date": "Sep 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR786866403", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "joetop"}, {"Content": "Good location, nice rooms, service was just ok We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and really enjoyed the room itself. It was very comfortable, nice linens, big fluffy towels, good sized modern bathroom. The bedroom was impressive with large windows and a chandelier. Breakfast was ok - one type of meat only, bread to toast with jam/nutella, pastries, juice, cereal. They made us a capuccino or espresso every morning. There is a small garden terrace where you can eat breakfast but it was too chilly to sit outside.It seemed to us that this is a family run hotel, the mother and father and one daughter rotate working the front desk, the other daughter appeared to be responsible for cleaning the rooms. The mother and father spoke very little/no English and when we went to check out, they didn't know how to use the credit card machine so they made frantic calls to their daughters to come in. We waited and as a result missed our train, but the daughters arrived and processed our credit card. We didn't find the service the friendliest or most helpful, we measured this against the excellent service we had at our hotels in Rome and Bolgona where the front desk person was incredibly friendly and hospitable with many suggestions and recommendations for restaurants, bars, tours, etc.", "Date": "Sep 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR877688892", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Ruttegger"}, {"Content": "Wonderful staff We found Hotel Il Duca by accident, and great luck! My mother had an accident on arriving in Italy and was confined to a wheelchair. She had made arrangements to stay in an apartment on Via della Pergola, but couldn't make it up the stairs. My brother walked down the street and found Il Duca. They could not have been nicer to us. They were very accomodating regarding the uncertainty of the day of her arrival (she was still in the hospital). The ground floor room she was in was beautiful and clean. The breakfast was wonderful and the stall (all family) went out of their way to make sure Mom was safe and comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel.", "Date": "Jun 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR433554540", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "mac318"}, {"Content": "El Hotel est\u8c29 en excelentes...   showReview(21582517, 'full');", "Date": "Oct 2, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR953936674", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187895-d1057133-r20433690-Hotel_Il_Duca-Florence_Tuscany.html", "HotelID": "1057133", "Price": "$240"}}
