CONS: - Our room wasn't available the first night and we stayed at a shared with reception and 2 other rooms-bathroom. The reception told us that it was an issue of the site i had booked the room , and i had to contact Philippines to arrange the issue. Next day i took the room i had paid BUT because i wasn't there the time they wanted me to change rooms..they moved my luggage(as we had arranged previous night) ,left me a note like : Dear ..your room is number .. AND THEY LEFT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM OPEN !!!! TO ANYONE WHO COULD ENTER THE HOTEL!!! - Room was everyday cleaned, except Sunday BUT never towel and sheet changed between the 4 nights. - Bed was TOO used. Very uncomfortable. - Reception area is not 24-hrs. That is ok, if only people where available at least during check-in/check-out time (we had to hear the phone ringing and the door bell several times from people that were trying to check-in). - Breakfast is offered but it is a croissant (not a fresh one and very small) and a coffee.

Given 2 conflicting reasons why other accomodation not available (Dream House) - 1. it was full 2. gas leak. Asked for a refund of the difference between the 2 hotel costs and showed with my laptop just how they compared on Agoda. He seemed to have a problem in dealing with my request and started getting angry and shouting. Once my husband came out of the room he witnessed the owner take an agressive stance as though he was about to strike me. My husband then said we are leaving and we want our money back. The manager left the hotel and returned then rudely slammed our refund on the counter. He then threatened to call the police as I had taken a video of his behaviour and made another attempt to grab me and my camera.

CONS: - Our room wasn't available the first night. We were sent to another hotel just for one night and asked us to come back the following morning. Discount was given for the remaining nights. - 1 tower and 2 small towels were the only thing we had available. - Room was never cleaned. No housekeeping even that we spent 4 nights there (not counting the one they sent us to another hotel). According to their note posted in the room, they change towels and lines every 3 days... that didn't happen. - Beds are hard, really hard. Very , very uncomfortable. Flipping the mattress and putting them upside down kind of helped. - WI-FI never worked for us (wrong password was provided, and it was never fixed). - Reception area is not 24-hrs. That is ok, if only people where available at least during check-in/check-out time (we had to hear the phone ringing and the door bell several times from people that were trying to check-in). - Breakfast is offered, but they give you a \"voucher\" to go somewhere else to get it. Sadly, the lady who was giving us the voucher couldn't give us directions how to get there (didn't speak English) The only reason why we stayed in this hotel more than one night is because we were so sick that we didn't have energy to find another place.", "Date": "September 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cNot even the basics\u201d", "Author": "TWisdom", "ReviewID": "UR76468826", "Content": "This hotel is horrible. For a start, in the hot Rome summer, there is no air-conditioning. And the room even lacks the basics. When we checked in, the room had no towels. We asked if we could get towels twice and both times were assured that towels would be forthcoming. When we got back to the room in the evening, there were still no towels. There was also nobody at the desk. After tracking down a phone number, we called and were assured that towels would arrive in 5 minutes and we would be able to shower after our hot day in Rome. After an hour of waiting, we called again and were once again assured that towels would arrive. Another half an hour and a phone argument later and we were finally told that there were no towels and we asked for whatever they had. We were at last given bedsheets to use as towels at 10:30 PM. Our next door neighbors had an even more pressing issue. They had a sick family member. As there was no service and they had no time to deal with the staff's garbage, they simply called the police to bring them to a doctor. This is the level of service you will receive at this \"hotel\". Attempting to get service at this hotel is terrible. Furthermore, it is not a hotel but a 5 bedroom apartment. Calling it a hotel is a misuse of the term. We were so disgusted that we simply left the next morning, forfeiting our 2nd night's fee and checking into a proper hotel. As an alternative to this place, we checked into the Hotel Orazia, a much better hotel with nice rooms, air-conditioning, and a professional staff in the same area.

Hotel is really clean and quiet, its amaizing even fo me how is possible that inside city centre can be rooms so quiet when out in the city is so noisy. Our room was cosy and nice colour. It looks that probably they have lately change furniture inside because it looked new. Staff was really great. Man in reception speak different languages so it was good. They give us free maps and explane about all city where to go and what is good to eat. Even they have one nice restaurant just 5 minutes distance. If you have a children thay give your child a small present. What else, we had internet inside the room, so was good to check mails in the night. In the finally i can reccomend this place.
