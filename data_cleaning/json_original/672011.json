{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Not recommended for people who used to clean place... I stayed Zhongtang hotel last week. Due to Olympic games, we did pay more than doubled fare than usual. Hotel was very charming, old chinese style which I love, but the problem was the bath room. We stayed in deluxe room, shower only. We were happy to have shower only, actually there is big wooden bath tub. And, the problem is, the bathroom had very bad drainage. There was no shower booth or curtain, we should use the shower in the wooden tub. that was OK, but that tub had no drain pipe and, all water just come out to the bathroom floor.Bathroom was huge, I think approx. 100sqft, half of that floor was like flood. And, bad drainage, bathroom had really bad smell.The worst thing was, when I wake up at 5:00 am, I saw big centipede in the bathroom.... Zhongtang peoples are nice, very charming place, but if you are very used to clean life, better to avoid this hotel. I booked the room thru expedia, with breakfast. Some misunderstanding, hotel people asked us to pay the breakfast cost when check out. I showed expedia's booking confirmation letter and had no trouble, but if you stay here, better to bring booking confirmation letter.", "Date": "Aug 17, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR473865204", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "blamari"}, {"Content": "LOVED the Zhong Tang!!!!!!

It was a mixed bag of results. Good:The staff at the hotel was very nice and helpful. They spoke very good English and were very friendly. They helped us book our hike at the Great Wall, arrange for a laundry service and cooked a wonderful breakfast. The rooms were clean, but it was a bit surprising when we found that our bathrooms included a one room housing both the toilet and the commode.Bad:The location was terrible. We apparently did not do our research well enough because the hotel was located a good 20-30 minute walk from a metro stop. The walk itself wasn't the problem, but when you are trying to pack a ton of stuff into a short stay every few minutes counts. This was the only time I felt uncomfortable walking at night in Beijing...walking through the neighborhood we were staying! Our rooms also had some plumbing issues. After a shower, you got stuck with an hour or two of total stinkiness. All in all, I would stay there again, but only for one night (instead of 4!)", "Date": "Nov 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR863364122", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "1"}, "Author": "TexasChick31"}, {"Content": "The Tang Experience The Tang is a traditional Siheyuan style courtyard hotel in the western XICHENG district and about 30 minute walk or an inexpensive $2 taxi ride from the Forbidden City. It's also a short walk to Xidan and shopping. If you want to really have a local experience away from the western style hotels, try an area where the locals live - try this or another courtyard hotel along a hutong. The Tang is the renovated home of Ertai, a former prime minister in feudal China (500 years ago). There are a range of room sizes so if you want more room request a deluxe room or deluxe suite. The beds are traditional Chinese. Breakfast (Chinese or western) in the courtyard was delightful. Dining in the local restaurants was a very tasty and inexpensive experience (pre-Olympics). There were approximately an equal number of Chinese and western guests registered. The staff are courteous, efficient, knowledgeable, and conversant in English.", "Date": "Sep 16, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR367194066", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Travelnfam105"}, {"Content": "Wonderful! We stayed at the Zhong Tang Hotel for 5 nights in August 2007. We had been booked into this hotel by our travel agent and having checked the hotel website were prepared for a different hotel experience!This hotel is basically a restored traditional courtyard house in central position.It is full of atmosphere and character and the staff, mostly women who speak some English, are very friendly and welcoming. The front desk people were also good at writing down names of places in chinese to show taxi drivers. There are also computers with free internet access.The rooms are clean and well kept with nice traditional furniture and safety box.All of the guest rooms here face a courtyard. It is possible to have western or Chinese breakfast, and in summer it is possible to have breakfast in the courtyard.The atmosphere is quiet and cosy\u9225?really amazing!", "Date": "Aug 22, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR186827632", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Qipao75"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g294212-d672011-r19056518-Zhong_Tang_Hotel-Beijing.html", "HotelID": "672011", "Price": "$84"}}
