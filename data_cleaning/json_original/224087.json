If you're not a timeshare owner, and you're renting a room here instead of a hotel, you'll love it. If you're used to other Marriott Timeshares, this place is very nice, I do recommend it, but it's not a Marriott 5 star timeshare. The room was excellent, the grounds were excellent, nice pool, and ammenities. However, unlike other timeshares, this lacked onsite food and grocery service. Yes, they had a snackbar by the pool, can get hotdogs and such, but only till 5pm. They had a little \"store\" area inside the lobby, but it was no bigger then my master bedroom walk in closet. For many people, this is fine, however, staying at other Marriot Timeshares with \"The Marketplace\", where you can get a wide assortment of foods, drinks, hot coffee, danishes, cakes, snacks, etc, this was a disappointment. Also no onsite bar or restaurant. Now, I'm not saying I would not come back here, I would. Just that it's not as nice as others. This place, even though it was in a busy town like Branson, was VERY QUIET, you felt like you were in a lodge in the middle of no where. Quiet and peaceful. Hard to believe that just a few hundred feet or so down the road was tons of hotels, 100's of shows and attractions. The outdoor pool was fantastic! Very large, multiple sections, with lots of sitting areas. Plus an indoor pool, indoor hot tub, and 2 outside hot tubs. Also, multiple gas BBQ's around the area to cook your own burgers or steaks if you wish. The staff was decent, the room were great, all modern large flat screen tv's, full kitchens, nice bath and master bedroom. If you're a family, looking to enjoy the many things Branson has to offer, this place is for you. Very family/kid friendly. If you're an older couple like us, looking for a quiet week away from home, or looking to catch some on the shows, you'll enjoy it just as much. So, I could have given this a 5, but after staying at other Marriott timeshares, this place is a notch below, but still excellent quality, and a great place to stay!!!!!!", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincoln, Nebraska, USA", "Title": "\u201cTwo bedrooms- Great for 2 couples vacationing together!!\u201d", "Author": "Kate H", "ReviewID": "UR140199744", "Content": "We brought our friends with us on our trip to Branson and were pleased to have 2 bedrooms with 2 bathrooms!

This resort is very nice. It's spacious and comfortable. I can tell this resort is a bit older than the other two we've been to (St. Kitts Beach Club and Harbour Lake in Orlando), but it is still very nice. We have a 2 bedroom with a balcony and it seems they have given us a one bedroom suite that has a connecting door to a one bedroom studio suite (includes small kitchen). I really like this set up, even more so than the other two places we've been because my Mom came with me so she really had her own separate space, with a kitchen. The pool is very nice, but smaller than I anticipated. The website says there are four pools...really it's 2 large pools and 2 kiddie pools. There is a large main pool outside with a hot tub and a fenced in kiddie pool outside, which we were grateful for with a four and one year old. I do wish there was a shade of some sort at the outdoor kiddie pool, as it did get a bit bright and hot for my munchkins. The indoor area is just a large pool with a very small separate kiddie pool and another hot tub. We didn't need to use it, but I appreciate that they have it for the cooler seasons. The lobby and store isn't much to write home about. There are some lincoln logs that entertained my kids during check in, but that's about it. They do have activities for the kids and a small (basically just a slide) playground. I personally think they should move that slide over to the kiddie pool to add shade and a little more entertainment in the water. All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much. We stayed on the fifth floor of the fifth building and had a very nice view. We will certainly be returning to this property in the future. I gave a \"lower\" score for service, simply because everyone was nice but not overly helpful. We didn't get very many tips when we asked for advice on local activities to do with kids. They just said the \"Fish hatchery\" and that was it. We discovered the train ride and the boat cruise on our own and basically just went out looking for things to do. They just gave us a map of the area. The resort does not have a restaurant and we did not order room service (not even sure they have it), so I really couldn't give any scores on that. I did, however, see a Jimmy John's delivery directly to the pool and a few pizza deliveries going up the elevator. There are a lot of restaurants near the hotel, a Subway across the street, a McDonalds & Walmart just about a mile away and 2 miniature golf courses right by the hotel as well.

We have stayed regularly in Williamsburg, VA, Hilton Head, SC, and Orlando where our expectation were exceeded. I reserved two and a half units in Branson with expectation of the same quality of property that we purchased. Willow Ridge apparently was a Horizon by Marriott property in it's first life and an attempt is being made to reinvent it into a Marriott Vacation Club property. Our units were clean but smaller than the normal Marriott Vacation Club property, a significant detail when you are bringing 9 adults and 5 children on a vacation. The overall appointments of the unit are of much lower quality than where I own. The property is smaller than it appears in the pictures with one large pool and two hot tubs. To add insult to injury I requested handicapped accessible rooms for my grandson who is in a wheelchair, upon checking in this request was not found and not able to be accommodated without separating our party. During business and personal travel I utilize every type of Marriott property, from Fairfield Inns to Renaissance, depending on what my needs and plans are.

Don't miss Sunday brunch at the College of the Ozarks. It's more pricey than other local places, but the food is spectacular.

The resort is set just off the strip but is very quiet and you feel secluded even though you're still close to all the Branson action. We stayed in a 1 Bedroom Villa and it was the perfect size for our family with a 3 1/2 year old and a 10 month old. The room was very clean and well furnished. They provided a highchair and porta-crib for my baby which was so nice. My 3 year old slept on the pull-out couch. The kitchen was fully equipped and stocked with everything you need to make and eat meals. Which we did everyday. We cooked 1 meal a day, breakfast, lunch and a dinner. Since they do not have a on site restaurant here's a tip, go to Big Cedar Lodge the Worman House for Sunday Brunch. It's a little pricey but so worth it and really delicious. Kids under 4 eat free ;) The pool was perfect. There is a separate gated kiddie pool that has a zero depth entry and max depth of 1.5 feet so my 10 month old and 3 year old loved it. The other larger pool was gorgeous and never over crowded. It also has a zero depth entry which my 3 year old loved. The Hitchin' Post is the pool side cabana restaurant, opened from 11 to 6. It serves panini sandwiches and hotdogs with a variety of toppings, quesadillas, snacks, ice cream. Get the souvenir cup of shaved ice and refill it for a $1. There is so much to do. The resort constantly has activities planned everyday, all day for all ages. Aqua aerobics, wine glass painting, ice cream time, poker, movies on their big screen. We did the free smores one night and my son got to paint a piggy bank to bring home for just 5 bucks. Two things I want to mention that I did not like about Willow Ridge. First, they do not have any spa services on site. I would have loved to have a massage while my Hubby watched the boys for an hour. When I called to ask if they provide the service they directed me offsite to a spa. :-/ Second, if you wanted to have your towels exchanged you would be charged, 1 Bedroom Villa $8, Two Bedroom Villa $12. With a family of four you need clean towels after a few days. We decided to wash them ourselves since the room has a washer dryer unit. Also, maid service is not provided to the Villas during your stay. Again, you would be charged. Tidy service $15 or $25, Full Clean $45 or $62. Really?? Once during our week stay it would have been nice to have our room cleaned. I do have to say that I called the 2nd to last day we were there and complained that we had no toilet paper left and that our tub was filthy and asked for cleaning supplies. They instead sent two maids out and cleaned our bathtub and provided tp, no charge :) Staff is extremely nice and very helpful.

Shower water pressure is pathetic. Elevators are a bit slow. We needed to print out some documents and fax them back and the business center charged .35 a MINUTE!!! for internet usage.

I wasn't about to waste whatever amount it would take to get internet on their computer. Lastly, when checking in we enquired as to a few of the shows. When asked about Dixie Stampede, (which we were really excited about, and loved after going) the concierge said it wasn't her cup of tea and that she liked 50's and 60's rock and roll! I found this to be inappropriate. A concierge should give you a run down of shows not her own likes and dislikes. We were in Branson with a 9 year old. 50's and 60's rock and roll was not gonna fly.

So, I defaulted to my next preferred chain where I can get points, Marriott. I am so glad I ended up here instead of the Hilton! The location is just off the strip in a newer section along Green Mountain Drive. You'll need a car to get around Branson anyway, so being here wasn't a problem at all. Plus, there's no noise or traffic in this area. It is just a few blocks to the strip and the Presley theater is directly behind the property up the hill. Apparently this resort was supposed to be much larger, but they only completed three of the buildings. So, for the foreseeable future anyway, it isn't likely that any of the facilities will be overcrowded since they were built to handle ten buildings. The resort doesn't look unfinished, the grounds are beautiful and everything is impeccably maintained. The three 5-story \"villa\" buildings surround a pool, shuffleboard, and game areas. Tennis courts are on site also, plus a small wiffleball diamond. The outdoor pool wasn't open yet, which is odd because it was well over 85 degrees the whole week, but I guess that kind of weather is unusual since no other area hotels had outdoor pools open either. The staff at the front desk was outstanding. They were pleasant at check in/out, very helpful, and willing to provide whatever information needed. There is a concierge on duty to book shows and such during regular business hours. When I had a problem connecting to the free internet, the person I spoke with at the front desk went out of her way to help me even though it was AT&T's fault, not the hotel's. She even offered to let me use the computer in the lobby if I needed to get something important done. By the way, the internet problem wasn't resolved until the next day, but it wasn't the hotel's fault at all. When it worked, it was very fast. We had a one bedroom villa that was more like a private condo than a hotel room. I realize time shares are different than a hotel, but this place is very nice. The furniture was comfortable, as were the beds. The full kitchen was spotless and came with cleaning supplies, paper towels, etc. The washer/dryer in the room came in handy and worked out great. Hotel guests get free maid service every day just like you would in a regular hotel. They changed our towels daily and made the beds. The corridors are open air, which is odd for a place like Branson with such severe weather, but since it was warm during our stay, it was fine. The buildings have an elevator. Everything is very well maintained and looked almost new. As others have mentioned, you can hear people walking around above you, so hope that you get lucky and they aren't too loud. We were fine. We couldn't hear any other noises through the walls. There is no food service on the premises except snacks for sale in the shop by the front desk. I don't know if there are plans for a restaurant if the resort is eventually built out, but there should be. They had lots of scheduled activities during the day, plus several movies shown every night. I didn't participate in any of them, but if you are staying any length of time be assured there is something to do to entertain you and your children. I would definitely choose this property if I return to Branson. By the way, I got two phone calls to encourage me to come to the marketing desk. One right after we arrived to offer me a discount coupon book and a special deal on a stay at another Marriott Vacation Club. I declined and that was the end of it, no pressure at all.

I have traveled to several Marriott vacation club resorts as we are multi-week MVCI owners so I have high expectations. This is a \"lower\" level vacation club property but what it lacks in amenities it gains it in cleanliness. And the only thing it lacks from most other Marriott Vacation Club properties is granite counter tops. The resort is not too big so walking to the main building from any of the buildings is easy. My son and his friend have enjoyed playing basketball, swimming in the indoor pool (as the outdoor pool is not open yet), playing ping-pong and pool. I have used the exercise room and simply just relaxed sitting on the patio. The unit is very clean as I mentioned before. The beds are very comfy with luxury linens. The unit comes with a washer and dryer and fully equipped kitchen. The internet connection is free and fairly fast. Parking is easy.

After we settled in our room we took a tour around the resort and loved how many family activities were offered. The resort offered basketball, tetherball, horshoes, a fire pit, bbq grills, shuffle board, craft activity room, an arcade, a small playset( slides only) and best of all the pools. We were delighted to see that the outdoor pools were still open even in late september because they were heated. They had three outdoor pools; one large, one kiddie and one hot tub/ spa. We took our daughter to the kiddie pool and since it was only 18 inches deep she could run and play all she wanted. She had such a wonderful time in the kiddie pool.

A big bunch of my family stayed here for a weekend family reunion. My parents and aunt and uncle are Marriott time share owners, so they started it by booking these condos/villas. I didn't know what to expect and so I was floored when we opened the door and saw where we were staying. My parents had booked a studio room (Queen bed with couch/table area and kitchenette with attached bathroom) that connected to a one-bedroom suite (Queen bed with attached bathroom, full living room with couch and easy chairs, dining area and full kitchen). My sister and her 4 kids had the same set up down the hall. My Aunt and Uncle had a room with 2 bedrooms (a Queen with private bath and then one with 2 doubles, living room, dining area and full kitchen.) Was happily surprised to see the kitchen was equipped with most everything you'd need to cook and prepare meals (which we did). We took turns hosting meals for our large family over the days and we had tons of room for everyone. In all, in our two connecting rooms, we had 3 flat screen t.v's, and 2 bathrooms. I came without my family and for me, it was like having a luxury vacation with my super comfy bed and linens and all those fabulous pillows, my own tv, and bathroom attached. I really enjoyed it. Also, the bathtub was wonderful...very big and held a ton of piping hot water. The resort itself was amazing. They had everything you could want (books to borrow, a piano to play, self-serve popcorn machine, a little store for things you forgot) and need. I enjoyed their fitness room. The treadmill, elliptical and bikes all had tvs on them. I ran 5 miles just so I could finish my movie. They even had complimentary water and nice fluffy towels. The playroom/arcade looked fun for the kids, as well as the craft room. The indoor pool and spa didn't seem to get much use because the outdoor pool was amazing! Just like you see in Hawaii...it had varying grades and depths, a waterfall, a volleyball net and a splash area for kids. There was a hut hot tub that was shaped more like a kidney bean. In addition, there was another seprate kiddie pool that was 1 ft for the little ones. I thoroughly enjoyed myself out here...with my book and some sunscreen, I was happy for hours even in the heat. The snack bar had everything you might want (pool toys, sunscreen and food). I enjoyed the shaved ice ($5 for the souvenir cup and then $1 refills) immensely. There were a lot of activities (Free and some for fee) like movies, s'more roasting on a firepit, cannonball and pool games, Karoake, crafts for the kids, golf excursions, etc. When my cousin's daughter had her craft taken by mistake by another little girl, the staff not only refunded their money, they gave them all the supplies they would need to make another one so they could do it at home. Now, that's service! In addition to the free WiFi, the front desk staff generously allowed us to print some documents for our family reunion for free by giving us their email addresses and printing them in the office -- much appreciated. In all, I felt like I had a mini luxury vacation really (that might also be attributed to me being child-free for the first time in quite awhile), but I really did enjoy the entire thing.

A beautiful resort in Orlando close to all the activities central Florida has to offer. However, in most years we do tend to deposit our week just to see other parts of the world. We had not seriously considered Branson as a venue until last year when we decided to it was time for a family reunion trip. Branson, Mo. seemed to offer a good choice of activities for the entire family. I really didn't expect the Marriott Willow Ridge Resort to stack up well with other Marriot Time Share resorts but I was certainly wrong. It was the perfect choice for our family. I really believe if you never left The Marriott Willow Ridge Resort property you would have a great time in Branson. It is smaller than most other Marriott's we have been to. But, that takes nothing away from this property. It is very cozy and comfortable. You are less than a mile from the Branson \"Strip\" but you would never know. The experience feels very exclusive. The staff is courteous and attentive to every need. There are many activities planned and uplanned. I was a little disappointed in the pool bar prices but, that's Branson. Everything is overpriced. Also, there is no restaurant on the property. Not a problem though, there are many restaurants in the area. The suites are immaculately clean 2 bedroom 2 bath suites with fully stocked kitchen (not food) and living area. They offer big screen LCD TV's in the bedrooms and living are with DVD players. The bed and bedding is to die for. You will sleep like a baby. If you need anything, just call and your request will be fulfilled in minutes. I agree with many other posts about this resort. It is the best selection in the entire Branson area. Now, a little about Branson. The last time my family was in Branson was 1988. I am sorry to say that age has not improved the area. The entire experience is simply designed to suck dollars from your wallet...so be prepared. However, Silver Dollar City lives up to it's excellent reputation. It is well worth the time and mony we spent for admission. Check out the Branson visitor's center for the two for one ticket sale. You will get two days for the price of one versus what you will pay at the park. As for the rest of Branson, just drive on the \"yellow\" routes, avoid main street and keep you money in your wallet.

Every single member of the staff we interacted with was courteous, friendly, and helpful. Many of them went out of their way to help us get what we needed for our rooms, as well as to give us tips for getting around town or to prepare us for the different places we planned to visit. When we called to request towels, they called 5 minutes later to make sure we received them and to ask if we needed anything else. The cleaning staff greeted us with smiles in the hallway, and the maintenance staff did, as well. The outdoor pool was perfect for my little kids, and was great for the big kids, too. There were several hot tubs and an indoor pool, a game room to play pool & ping pong, and then board games you could check out and take back to your room. All Free. Then around the grounds there was shuffleboard, basketball, horseshoes, and probably other things I just didn't see. In addition to this, they were constantly having activities and games. I was a little disappointed that you had to pay for some of them, like ice cream at the pool, but oh well. Several nights there were s'mores at the fire pit, and then movies in one of the rec rooms- Kid movies & more grown up movies. We seriously could have been entertained at the resort all week. The grounds were well kept. There was plenty of parking and it was easy to navigate the resort. As we drove around Branson, I was grateful we were staying there, as almost everywhere else was really quite a dump. We went to the Amazing Pet Show since we thought that would be a good activity for our kids, but it was a huge waste of money. I am sure there are alot of good shows in town, but that is not one of them. Because of flooding earlier this year, alot of the hiking trails around Table Rock Lake are closed, as is Moonshine Beach, so that was disappointing. And Branson Landing suffered damage from that, as well. We spent the week sitting by the pool, cooking dinner in the kitchens in our rooms or on the free gas grills outside. There are also picnic tables outside you can use. The kids ran back and forth between the rooms, and the resort felt completely safe. The kids loved to go on walks around the resort and explore the many different sidewalks. The rooms all had TV's & DVD players. Free WIFI internet. The beds were extremely comfortable. Washers & Dryers right in your room so you can go home with all of your launry clean and ready to put away! The resort will lend you a high chair for free, if you need one. The shower even has 2 shower heads- one low one that you can use to give the little kids a bath = awesome.

It exceeded my expectations and we will definitely make this our new go-to spot for weekend getaways to visit Silver Dollar City. Our two kids (ages 3 & 4) LOVED the resort's pools--we could have stayed there for a few days and done nothing else in town and they would have been happy splashing in the kiddie pool fountains. The pools definitely set this property apart . The landscaping is beautiful , there are multiple hot tubs set apart from the rest of the pool area, and there is a snack bar, fountains, lots of chairs and lounger space, etc.--all things that set the pool area apart from a \"regular\" hotel pool. As a mom of little ones, I appreciated that they had a lifeguard, zero-entry pools, and depths as shallow as 1.5'--my little kids were able to enjoy a pool space separate from the \"big\" kids and it was great. There were a lot of people enjoying the pool area, but it was large enough that it never felt really crowded. The main building of the Lodge also offered movies, arts & crafts, planned activities (we were there on Smores night!), and a small playground--it's definitely family friendly. We stayed in one of the guest rooms that offers a kitchenette, a sleeper sofa (which was fine for our kids, but would have been uncomfortable for a teen/adult), and a queen bed and it was perfect for our family of four for a couple of nights. The kitchenette included the basics for a few easy meals eaten in the room (the table was actually set when we arrived, a nice touch!), and the room was not big but it was comfortable. For a longer stay (or for a bigger group or older kids) I would recommend getting adjoining rooms or one of the villas for added space (and the villas are nice because they have a balcony and a washer/dryer). I booked just a day before traveling, and I wasn't able to book via a TripAdvisor link because the discount websites said there was not availability. The Lodge's direct website, however, did have availability and a web discount that turned out to be a great value considering how nice the property was.

They gave us a schedule for the week's activities, but we didn't get to do any of them. Would have loved to roast marshmallows at the campfire, but they didn't have it the nights we were there.

I had heard many good things about Branson for a family destination so that is where we chose to go. We have been owners with Marriott for many years but had never stayed at a Horizons before. So this was a new experience also. Positives: The resort was beautiful. Landscaping, pool, hot tubs, rooms all decorated nicely. The staff was amazing. So friendly and wanting to help make the stay perfect in any way they could. We had a 2 bedroom, 2 bath villa that was not a lock off and it was very comfortable for our family. We were very fortunate to have a room that over looked the pool. It was beautiful both in the day time and in the evening. Negatives: The concierge, while very helpful and willing to set up what ever activity you wanted, had not actually gone to the shows them self. We could hear all the noise from the rooms around us. The first few days we were there the people above would walk heavy and it would start at 6:30 a and go to 11 p. When I say heavy, I mean giant stomping heavy, wake you from deep sleep heavy. It was horrible. We had to beg to be moved to a different room. This was tough because the hotel was full but the manager finally made it happen. We got the room that the stompers were in. While moving from one room to the next we tried to simulate the stomping and we had to literally jump on the floor... but who knows. I personally blame the construction of the building for this. We have only had this problem in one other Marriott property. (Manor Club Sequel) After we changed rooms we only had the door slammings from the other villas. This was enough to rattle the pictures on the walls. Speaking of construction. Marriott is putting in a bunch of buildings. The actual construction was not noticed at all. Even though they were building every day we were there. The big down side to this I can see is that the pool will be way to small for the number of people the buildings are going to be able to hold.

This is one of our better trades! Location, location, location! Horizons at Branson is a brand new resort right in the heart of Branson. We were very close to \"the strip\" and within walking distance to many attractions and local eateries (not that we walked it... we vacationed in the middle of December during two ice storms!). The grounds were very well kept and everything was so clean and new. We stayed in a two-bedroom villa where one of the bedrooms was a \"lock-out\" unit that could be closed off and rented out if we chose. We decided to bring my husband's parents instead. It worked out really well because the lock-out unit had its own sitting area and TV, bathroom, kitchenette, and separate entrance, so the parents could relax by themselves and feel like they were in their own little retreat away from the \"kids\". The villa was warm, inviting, beautifully decorated, and very spacious. Some of the things we like about Horizons by Marriott properties are the villa amenities such as the in-room laundry facilities and full kitchen. We didn't worry too much about bringing enough clothes because we were able to do laundry whenever we wanted. And, instead of going out to eat for every meal, the family just went out once a day and then took every other meal in the villa. We really felt like it was our home away from home! The amenities on the property were also very nice. Indoor and outdoor pools and jacuzzi, craft room, movie room... and the lobby was so beautiful. It had several little nooks and quiet seating areas to read or play a card game. They had DVDs for rent and a few snacks and toiletry items for sale in case you left something at home. (There is a large grocery store and a Wal-Mart about a half mile down the road, and that was very convenient, too, and a little more reasonably priced). The concierge service was very helpful during our stay. We had a few gaps in our itinerary and they were able to help us book extra shows. The resort also had a full activities schedule including activities such as crafts, ice cream socials, Texas Hold'em tournamants and, my husband's favorite, Blackjack tournaments. Many of these activities were free. While my vacation was wonderful, I don't know if I would buy a timeshare unit here. \"The devil is in the details\" when it comes to new construction, and this is not the best quality construction I've seen. One of the bathtubs was not installed level so the water would poor off the back ledge and down the wall and onto the floor no matter how careful you were to keep the shower off the back of the tub. There was already water damage and our building could not have been more than a year old (we did our best to towel dry the area after every shower, but not every guest is going to be so careful). Also, I went to hang a towel onto the towel rack in the main bathroom and the towel rack fell to the floor! You could see the drywall rubbed away under the spot where the towel rack was installed against the wall. The kitchen counters are laminated (not granite like I have typically seen in other Horizons by Marriot resorts) and they were already chipped, and someone had unfortunately used it as a cutting board and left gouges. But back to the positive stuff... this was a REALLY great place to stay. There is so much to do in Branson and we will come back someday. We'll even consider staying at Horizon's by Marriott again.

The decor was so stylish and up to date, but I can't tell you how much of a wonderful experience this was. This place has everything you could possibly need and even though it doesn't have its own on-site restaurant, they don't need it really. There are so many places to eat around there it didn't bother us at all. Plus, there is a grocery store and wal-mart in the same parking lot just a few blocks from the resort. You don't even have to get back on Hwy 76 to get to the shopping center. We will recommend this place to anyone and everyone, and will definitely go back. I will never want to stay anywhere else, and I was actually sad to leave!!", "Date": "April 3, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tulsa, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cFantastic!\u201d", "Author": "Masonpips", "ReviewID": "UR4309165", "Content": "We stayed here Dec 26-28 and absolutely loved it. We went to Silver Dollar City first and then left when it got busy and checked in. We had a 1 bedroom suite on the 3rd floor of building #1. When my husband and kids walked in they said \"WOW\". It was huge and fully equipped. The kitchen was enoromous and we went out to get breakfast foods to have each morning. The kids slept on the sofa bed in the living room and it seemed larger than normal (more like a queen versus a double) and the bed in the bedroom was nice! Great comforter, lighting, tv location. We wandered the lobby/activities area one evening and there were lots of people in the indoor pool, others doing crafts, others playing pool or ping-pong. They had a book swap and several puzzles going on in various locations. All in all, a very enjoyable stay and a lovely place!", "Date": "December 28, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Unknown", "Title": "\u201cA Week in Branson\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4155982", "Content": "Our family spent a week, Nov. 19-26, 2005 at the Horizons of Marriott in Branson, Mo. with the most wonderful accomodations and week full of the best entertainment anyone could ever have experienced. As an owner of the Horizons for only about a year, this was our first stay with the Marriott in Branson. Part of our family stayed the first of the week and remaining family joined us for the Thanksgiving weekend. The villa was just lovely. Decorated with great colors and every accomodation needed, just like home! We used the kitchen to prepare the entire Thanksgiving dinner as if we were at home. This was the most perfect time to visit Branson with all the many many Christmas shows and light displays everywhere. We are still amazed at the millions & millions of lights at Silver Dollar City. It truly got you in the Christmas spirit. We enjoyed the Pierce Arrow show and Shoi Tabushi show so very much as well as Andy Williams & The Legends. The Branson Belle served a great lunch and the Christmas show was good too. The weather was actually good as well. Warmer than back in central Illinois that week. We were not aware that the day after Thanksgiving is the big day to shop in Branson too!!!! Overall, we just enjoy Branson for everything it has to offer. This was our mother's first visit to Branson and even though she was very tired when she returned home, she stated this was the BEST vacation she had ever had. I would suggest this to be a vacation spot everyone should experience once in a lifetime. Horizons of Marriott can also give you a beautiful place to stay.

Marriott Rewards members). Not an owner, we just rented a guest room on-line as no villas were available. I found the front desk service lacking a lot, before I could finish a question about their on-site provisions (aka milk), I was cut off and was told to go directly to Wal-Mart! I was not impressed. Basically, the front desk was not helpful at all throughout the stay. The Concierge desk was helpful in getting theatre tickets (after 2 calls and a visit). A plus, was a free Branson-Springfield coupon book. As it was the end of Oct, only the indoor pool with tiny kid pool & spa was open. All outdoor pool areas were closed (not on the web-site). A kids play area was only open from 9-5, and we never got to visit it. The property is new with only 2 accomodation buildings at present. I do not recommend the guest rooms for any group other than a couple. It's just way too cramped. Ours didn't have a tub in the bath only a shower, which was a problem as the baby screams in a shower. The room was clean and well styled. The bed very comfortable! The mini-fridge was not working correctly and I had difficulty getting all the baby bottle supplies in it. Traveling alone with kids is a challenge, but it was hard getting all of our things inside & out in the light rain. Someone came by in a cart and helped a couple get their things in, but no offer to us or others. No laundry in guest rooms but free use of a washer/dryer in the building. I did notice an outdoor area with BBQ grills. The maid came in daily as we were renters, not owners and cleaned up somewhat, but not as I would except and she was rude one day when we were still in the room when she wanted to clean. When we left the room just before 11 am, she made the comment \"can I finally get in.\" Green Mountain road is a great location when visiting Branson, easy to access the feeder roads to just about everywhere and avoid hwy 76 (which is a parking lot in summer! No kidding). Just off the property is Pirates Cove, a miniature golf course the kids enjoyed. We also rode the ducks (as a old-timer to Branson, I had never done this, but the kids insisted!) and it was fun and worth the cost (use a coupon). Near the Days Inn is a great Mexican Restaurant (authenic food and low prices, plus we used a coupon from the book.) Krispy Kreme, McD's, Denney's quick for Breakfast. No food at all on property (except popcorn in the lobby, lol!). Get your show tickets at the Concierge desk. Use the feeder roads. Use the coupon book or coupons from brochures available everywhere (including wal-mart). Overall the property is very nice, staff need more training in service, room well-kept, comfortable & clean. Get at least 1 bedroom villa with 4 people. Will probably try this property again in warmer weather and hope the staff are nicer.", "Date": "November 4, 2005"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Marriott's Willow Ridge Lodge", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d224087-Reviews-Marriott_s_Willow_Ridge_Lodge-Branson_Missouri.html", "Price": "$96 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2929 Green Mountain Dr</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:municipality\">Branson</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MO</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">65616</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "224087", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/42/ef/42eff86e16a7607d07dff918ce0ffff812large.jpg"}}
