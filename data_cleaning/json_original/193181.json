The pros: * Clean rooms, especially the bathroom. VERY important for me - I'm rather picky when it comes to cleanliness. * Friendly and helpful staff * Excellent location in a quiet area and yet there are many restaurants (with a wide variety of cuisine) within only a few minutes walk. The Whitleys shopping centre is close too. Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park is also close. Two tube stations within easy reach - Bayswater (with two lines: District and Circle) and Queensway (the Central line). This means that you have pretty much everything in London within easy reach. Also, the area itself feels safe and this is also something that I value as a female traveller who sometimes does things on my own even if I'm travelling with others. * Cheap rooms - great if you want to spend your money on other things than lodging. The rooms are small but I rather spend my money on other things when in London so for this price, the size of the rooms doesn't bother me. Since the hotel is clean and cheap, I'm content. From what I've read about other hotels in the same price range here on Tripadvisor, I have to say that this is a gem.

I have stayed in a lot of hotels across the world and the staff here are some of the best. The rooms and the hotel in general are very clean. It is really close to Bayswater underground station and is situated in a lovely,safe neighbourhood. You can also leave you bags for free on the day you check out if you have a late flight, so that is an added bonus. The only negative is the size of the rooms- they are fairly small and compact. However, they are adequate and it should not put you off.
