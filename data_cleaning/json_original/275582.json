I paid \u00a326 for a single room, and as a regular budget hotel guest in London I know how cheap this is. My expectations were low... HOWEVER, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were very friendly, and although my room wasn't in the Ivy House itself (it was in Cedar Lodge, a few doors further down) there were card locks on all the interior and exterior doors and CCTV - it was pretty secure. The decor is very basic and somewhat tired, but I can't criticise the cleanliness of my room, the bed linen, or the bathroom. I was particularly happy to be upgraded to a double en-suite at no extra cost. If you are traveling to London and expect to be getting the value for money as in other major cities then you need to readjust your expectations. You are paying pretty much the lowest price in London and consequently you shouldn't expect a spacious and charming hotel room. To put it in perspective, a bed in a YHA dormitory in London is about \u00a320. What you should expect is somewhere that is functional and clean, which is what I got. Yes, the bathrooms are seriously tiny. Yes, the walls are paper-thin. Yes, the carpets are looking a little threadbare. However, if all you want is somewhere to watch a spot of TV and hit the hay then I don't think you could do better for the money. In conclusion, this is not somewhere I'll be staying with the wife for a romantic weekend break, but I'll certainly be booking it again when I want somewhere cheap to stay when I'm in town on my own. I didn't bother with the breakfast, so can't comment on it.", "Date": "March 8, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Truro, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDO NOT STAY HERE!!\u201d", "Author": "Bongebon", "ReviewID": "UR124512890", "Content": "Terrible place. We were taken down the road to an annex hotel ( if you can call it a hotel) and taken up 6 flights of very narrow stairs to a door - no landing - just a door that looked like it came from the hobbit as it was so small. Through the door was a loft room with a double bed and 2 singles....how the hell they got the beds in I will never know. The window was barred up like a prison cell with a nicotine stained curtain hanging off. The walls were black with damp. It smelt. Do you need to know any more??? We went straight back down stairs, back up the road to the ivy house and demanded our money back. We were ushered into a back room whilst a man tried to get my luggage off me saying he will put it somewhere safe for me.....I clung onto it!! It took about 30 mins of the man repeating \" but what is the problem?\" and me listing the endless problems...the main 2 were fire regs - how the hell anyone would get out of that room is beyond me.

The beds and towels appeared to be clean but the floor was pretty filthy and there were air fresheners dotting the room. I noticed right away that there was an apparatus on the wall that beeped every few minutes. I went back upstairs and got a gentleman to come check and it turned out to be a carbon monoxide detector with failing batteries. Instead of replacing the batteries, he just removed the detector from the room. I was traveling solo and the lock on the door appeared flimsy so I pulled the second bed in front of the door that night. Despite its small size the shower was strong and hot.

OK he said, you get a beautiful room in the Ivy Guest house, because the Annexe hotel has no private bathrooms (huh???!!!!, I thought that was exactly what I had booked.....) So we went to our room, well you could better say we went to our closet. Immediately after I saw the room, I understood why we had to pay for the 2 nights in advance, before we could see the room. The bed was 120cm by 190 or 200cm. There was an airconditioning, but this was only giving hot air, because it was so dirty with dust and so was the fan. The carpet had not been cleaned for I guess 3 years. The bathroom was 5 feet (my lady feet....) square. The shower compartment in there was 2 feet x 3 feet. Because it was so tiny, the whole bathroom became wet after 1 person had a shower . The room was VERY hot. Ofcourse London was hot too this July, but this was not normal. The location is perfect - right at Victoria station, but we had a room at the back, so we could almost touch the trains from our window. They ran till 1.30 or 2 at night, and started at 4.50hrs again. As you can understand, together with the heat, we did not sleep very well. The breakfast was OK: cornflakes with milk, toast, jams marmelade and butter. We paid Euro 73.- per night, but if you ask me what the room was worth, I would say not more than Euro 15 per night.
