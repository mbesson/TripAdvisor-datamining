{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very pleasant stay at this business-oriented hotel My favorite thing about the Frankfurter Hof is that it is centrally located. It's about a 5 minute walk from the Hauptbanhof (main train station), near lots of offices and a short walk to shopping (and the Christmas market in December). The lobby is nicely appointed. There is fresh fruit and water near the check-in. Newspapers are around the corner as you head to the restaurant. The staff are helpful and friendly. My room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. There was good closet space for a hotel room (with a small safe for jewelry/laptops). The bathroom was nice. The hotel has a turndown service that leaves you chocolate. There is a gym on the 6th floor (it was included in my rate; not sure if it is always free). If you are looking for English language TV, there isn't much (CNN  BBC only). At 28 euros, I decided that breakfast at the Frankfurter Hof was too expensive, but had plenty of alternate breakfast choices nearby - Starbucks, a bagel place and a cafe with Mercedes Benz cars - were all across the street. This is my 3rd or 4th stay at the Frankfurter Hof. I like the hotel a lot and find it convenient for my business travel.", "Date": "Dec 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR874388094", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "Blodgett"}, {"Content": "huge rooms, huge breakfast and great staff! It took us a little time to find this hotel as no-one we asked seemed to have heard of it, despite being described as the grandest of the grand in frankfurt! Look for the skyscraper with the poiny green bits on the top - its right near that. The room was huge with a separate dressing/safe room and biggish bathroom. The 'buffet' breakfast was superb and a very extensive offering with omellette/egg chef. The staff were all delightful and nothing was too much trouble. Our only complaint was not enough info in the room about the other services, such as the spa - we might have had a treatment if the info was more readily available. And my other half's pet hate - no tea/coffee facilities in the room! With room service being rather pricey and given the standard of the hotel we felt this was a little mean.We had a great night at 'Zu Alte Germana' in Sachsenhausan, which is a medieval style bar and eatery which was so authentic we felt we'd walked into a time warp and private medieval party! Also Klosterhof restaurant near the hotel was great value and (like everywhere it seems) enormous portions!", "Date": "Dec 8, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR147472226", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "jenniecat"}, {"Content": "Not 5 stars This is definitely not worth the money charged - claims to be 5 stars but the property is old and fading, furnishings are worn, needs redecoration.

The outside of the hotel makes it look like an historic venue; the sleeping rooms are more akin to an old Marriott. That is not necessarily a bad thing, just don't expect opulence or a sense of grandeur. The rooms are large enough (especially compared to other hotels in Europe) but the furnishings are standard and the bed is nothing to write home about. My bed had no sheets and a comforter that wasn't big enough to cover the entire bed.Service was prompt and cheerful. The room service food definitely could use an upgrade -- typically European runny scrambled eggs were not very appetizing.Still, overall this is a fine place to stay in Frankfurt since its downtown location is a major plus. Most business people would not find too much to complain about here; I am merely pointing out some of its (minor) weak points so readers will not expect to be staying in a five-star luxury property.", "Date": "Apr 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR914218916", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "PinguinVA"}, {"Content": "Terrible Experience with this Hotel This Hotel is run down and has a terrible cancellation policy. I was originally booked for April 5th and had to change to April 3rd due to a death in the family. I attempted to explain to them I had to leave Germany early due to a death in the family, but both Expedia and the Hotel would not budge and required I pay the full rate for April 5th booking and re-book another room on April 3rd.They have an odd cancellation policy-basically, if you book through a travel agent there is no opportunity to cancel or change the reservation. The Hotel is in bad shape, well past the need for renovations.In the main restaurant, Oskars, they charge 11 Euro for a bottle of mineral water. This is $17.00 for a bottle of water! When I complained about it on my bill, the management of the restaurant laughed at me. I was tired of my ordeal with this hotel and went to bed so I could awake for early flight and found the temperature and air in the room very uncomfortable.", "Date": "Apr 7, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR209522476", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "nelloNewYork"}, {"Content": "Stay here if you have to We stayed here during a big trade fair so occupancy and rates were both high.

We were shown a third room that stank of cigarette smoke - so we stayed with the first one and were moved the next morning to a more fragrant room that was noisy...The main restaurant in the hotel is excellent although the breakfast room was like an airport lounge and not very agreeable.

The hotel is centrally located in downtown Frankfurt -- convenient to business, restaurants, shops, the main train station and only about 15-20 minutes from the airport. The outside is most impressive; inside . . . well, read on.The lobby is spacious with lots of marble. However, it doesn't take more than a handful of people to make it seem crowded and noisy. The hotel bar is attractive and non-smoking. Service was prompt and prices were what you'd expect. Originally, I was offered a first floor room on the main street; when I asked for something more quiet, I got it, although with a view of the air conditioning system. The standard room was . . . standard. The ceilings are very high, giving a feeling of spaciousness and the room was relatively large. The furnishings included a double bed that wasn't particularly comfortable and a chair and ottoman that were. Decor was unmemorable and somewhat dated. TV was large but not flat screen. There is an in-room safe that is easy to use.The bath is small but modern, with lots of marble. The towels are unacceptable -- thinner than you would expect at a Motel 8 and you only get one bath towel and one hand towel -- not sure what you'd do with two people in the room. Amenities were replenished daily.Internet is expensive at 12 Euros/hour with no option for a daily charge. Thirsty from your trip and want a bottle of water? -- it will set you back 7 Euros. I did not dine in the restaurant or order room service. Elevators were relatively prompt given the size of the hotel. You can easily program your wakeup calls on the phone. Hallways are very wide but, for some reason, hallway noise gets into the room and thus, when the luggage carts roll by early in the morning, you hear them.The concierege was especially helpful both in providing information and in making restaruant suggestions/reservations. There is another staff member dedicated to helping with train/bus connections and I found her assistance invaluable.Overall, the Frankfurter Hof was acceptable in every regard but at no time did I feel that I was staying somplace special. On previous trips to Frankfurt, I've stayed at the Hessischer Hof and would definitely recommend that over the Frankfurter Hof if you are looking for a smaller property with more inclusions.", "Date": "Mar 15, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR331926575", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "MisstheDogs"}, {"Content": "Old World Graciousness When we arrived, for some unknown reason we were upgraded to a deluxe room.
