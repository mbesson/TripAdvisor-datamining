The Metro station is close to the Hotel and it's a plus. Rooms are regular, not too big, not to small, bathroom ok, reasonably clean. There are two entrances, the main one (where you can find the reception) and a second a few meters away. The personnel is not very professional but on the other hand it's very easy going so no problems. If you're looking for a cheap Hotel in Berlin i would definitely suggest this one. Average price for a double room is \u20ac40 and the wi-fi will cost you 5 euros more, which is acceptable.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow", "Title": "\u201clow budget, for one night only\u201d", "Author": "Mlisabonie", "ReviewID": "UR116168923", "Content": "Prices-VERY low, we paid around EUR75 for a family room.

Rooms-very modest, but clean. Do not expect hairdryer\\kettle\\shower cap. The building itself is over 100 years and this gives certain charm to the hotel (elevator is over 100 years,window handles are about the same age, etc) Food-nice, my kids loved the breakfast.

LOCATION - I really do not think that the location is good for exploring the rest of the city. The closest subway station is on the line, from which you have to change to get anywhere central and it takes time. For me it didn't work well. Also mind that the cheapest end of shops on Kurfurstendamm and KaDeWe is some 20-30 minutes away by foot from the hotel and you cannot go by subway there from your station. The surrounding area though is GREAT - very neat living district, Valentino and Gucci shops. Nice. Bus stop to Tegel airport is around the corner and it is 20 minutes by bus. Really comfortable. HOTEL - the hotel is a little shabby, my room was very small and very plain. The slamming of the entrance door on the floor has woken me up during the night several times. BUT breakfast is very good for the hotel level. I would advise to search for a hotel closer to the middle of Kurfurstendamm (next to K-damm subway station)", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh", "Title": "\u201cQuiet, slightly shabby, comfortable.\u201d", "Author": "Ryanair_fan", "ReviewID": "UR78698519", "Content": "My 17 y/o daughter and I (52 y/o male) travelled to Berlin for a 3 night break. We booked the Arta Lenz just 3 days before we were to arrive. We booked because it was available for the dates, within our budget and got reasonable reviews. Breakfast is also provided within the cost. The hotel is in a quiet street off the K-damm at the west end, close to Adenaurplatz U-bahn. The receptionist was polite and friendly. I offered a Visa card to pay the invoice and he asked if I could pay in cash. I couldn't and he accepted the visa card with grace. The twin room at the back 3rd floor was rather careworn but perfectly clean. The light faun curtains let in much of the morning light, but the shower room was clean and the beds comfortable. No tea / coffee in the room and the TV picture was poor. Breakfast is standard fare german.Cereal, Ham, boiled eggs, cheese, yoghurt, rolls, some fruit etc. Reception is 24 hour. Most staff appeared to be Russian. Apart from the fellow guests who thoughtlessly speak loudly and slam doors etc at 06.00, the hotel was pleasantly quiet day and night.

I would recommend this hotel to people who are looking for something inexpensive (3 nights = EUR240 for three people), friendly and slightly different from the usual generic hotel.
