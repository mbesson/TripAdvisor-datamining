Firstly, we booked and paid in advance through Agoda for a 'Premier' room...which looked lovely in the promotional material. When we booked in we were shown to a standard room with views to the building immediately behind the hotel...terrible. Anyway, we thought we would not even bother to unpack as we would go through the motions of attempting to get into something reasonable, so off we went to the reception desk where we waited and waited in the 'race' until one of the clerks was free. After some time and nearly one hour later with our baggage being delivered to the first room, we finally got into a better room - which we believe was a 'Premier' room on the corner of the hotel overlooking the hotel pool and the huge commercial fan array, that made an incredible noise the whole time we were there. Right outside the door of our room 1510.. was the entry to the lifts and the maid's working space. The noise that came from this area at all times of the day was annoying to say the least. No sleep ins here... we were usually awakened at about 7:15am with the noise of the cleaners starting to do their thing. We were also singularly unimpressed by the cleaning material and other things in the passage immediately outside our door and the fact that the doors to the cleaners lifts and workroom were left open for us to view when we were coming and going. I will attempt to get some photographs of all this posted as soon as I get time ... Now for the room... the towel rack in the bathroom fell to pieces leaving our towels in the bath. To their credit a repairman came the next day and fixed it. The room itself looked out over the river and as I said the hotel pool and fan array... if you ignored the noise and did not look down the skyline view was good. We then thought that we would try a meal in the restaurant advertised on the hotel brochures on the 7th floor. This was another trial. We got into the lift and pressed the 7th floor button and as quick as a flash ... nothing happened. We could not figure it out so thought we would go to the Coleman Restaurant on the 5th floor. It had a buffet advertised together with a meal that you could choose. We selected a nasi goreng and beforehand thought that we would have a Pina Colada each. Not cheap, Four sips and they were gone. There was nothing worth eating in the buffet, so we had the nasi goreng and left. While we were out we found another restaurant and had something to eat outside of the hotel later... If you think that is good... we thought breakfast was even worse. From the moment of embarrassment by the person checking us in - \"What room are you in ?\" \"1510\" \"Which room?\" \"One Five One Zero\" \"You are not on the list\" \"Which room are you in\" Fifteen Ten\", etc etc... this went on for about 3 minutes while the line up grew behind us. Eventually, after being severely embarrassed we were waved into the restaurant in a very dismissive and casual casual manner. Then we saw the supervisor, and witnessed here principal activity...it was to ensure that the toaster and the food service line was shut down precisely at 10:30am... she did not seem to do much more except talk to the wait staff (up to 5 at a time in a back corner). The handles on the trays containing the scrambled eggs, bacon, etc were filthy. They had grease and other mess all over them. When we got there - there was little left in them and I needed to scrounge around to get sufficient baked beans to put some on my plate...I am not going to describe the rest of it, because it just got worse. The bread used for toasting was very ordinary and difficult for guests to use. Now wait for it... on the THIRD morning of our stay we discovered a little area at the back of the restaurant where a chef was preparing eggs to order...we did not this facility until the third morning because it was in the dark and out of sight. Anyway, I ended up speaking with the manager and relayed my displeasure to him. He was actually a very nice Chinese gentleman and I really felt sorry for him because it was obvious to a casual observer that the supervisor was not properly supporting him. Amazingly, the next morning the place was better prepared although it did not seem to make much difference to the attitude of the female supervisor (responsible for shutting the toaster down!). All in all it was a very poor experience for us and a disappointing one. By the time we were ready to leave we simply wanted to get out of the place. I have said enough.. although I might relate this little bit of information as well. On our first day we went to catch a taxi at the front of the hotel. We were directed to the taxi stand - two clearly marked spots about 30 metres away from the hotel entrance by a staff member. On the second day we were at this taxi stand waiting for a taxi when we noticed that all the taxis bringing people to the hotel and dropping them at the hotel entry seemed to have guests / people getting into them and then driving directly past us as we stood patiently waiting... On the last morning (and for the first time), one of the fellows in the front foyer said would you like a taxi? ... As this was our last trip and we were going to the airport, we said we thought we would continue to do what we had been doing since our arrival and go to the taxi stand where two taxis were waiting. Before leaving I thought I would get my boarding passes printed at the Business centre... how about $2 for each sheet of paper! There was one very noticeable and bright aspect to our stay...two of the trainees were very friendly in the lift.. they were also noticeably not broken into the routine of the regular staff. The were bright and cheerful and obviously going about their business promoting a friendly attitude. I don't know what could have gone right in this place. We wished we had booked elsewhere.

My initial emails sent to the hotel regarding internet charges and availability of non-smoking rooms were answered promptly with all the information I required. Check-in was prompt and I was given a non-smoking room in the Excelsior Tower on the 11th floor. Initially when I opened the door there was a loud noise coming from outside, a quick look confirmed that it was the roof air-con units belonging to the Funan Centre next door. I thought I would give it one night before complaining but these were turned off at 8.45pm every evening so in the end were not a problem. Tea/coffee making facilities with fridge inside the room. The room was a lot larger than I expected and decorated in a modern, pleasing way. No complaints with the bathroom. Modern glass basin, walk-in shower, no water coming into the toilet area as reported in some reviews. The view was awesome of the city scape, the colourful old Hill Street Police Station, Fort Canning Park and the space ship design of the new Supreme Court. Morning paper delivered each day. All staff I came across were very friendly, professional and helpful. I witnessed on more than one occassion staff coming out of the front office to check on the reception area and then additonal staff being sent out to help. Public hotel areas were spotless with again staff checking the decor, carpets, cushions etc. For cheap and fantastic meals, try the food court on level 5 or 6 at the Funan Centre. Fantastic meals, spotless and a lot nicer & cheaper than the tourist hotspots of the outdoor hawker centres. Average cost was $4 Singapore Dollars (\u00a32.00) - bargain!", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Vancouver, Canada", "Title": "\u201cWould stay again.\u201d", "Author": "Vikingrrl", "ReviewID": "UR123571943", "Content": "This is an older hotel, newly renovated and an excellent location.

The breakfast buffet is $32 per person, I would not recommend it, although large variety, it is just not worth it, there are other cafes and restaurants close by.

At first I thought I had many choices within the budget , but nowadays all hotels price are just too expensive in Singapore. After too many frustrated feedback from few travel agents, I decided to book a hotel myself with hotels directly in Singapore. Most hotels' reservation centre with poor English and they were not eager for a business either . Finally, I found a good one and thank you so much again for the sales and reservation department from Peninsula Excelsior Hotel for being so effective and caring ! I booked the premier club room which included the sky lounge privilege. The sky lounge got a very beautiful view facing the Marina Bay. At night the new hotel, Marina Bay Sands had two light shows and you could enjoy it at the sky lounge. Many hotels in Singapore have no wifi, this hotel have no wifi in the room either, but free wifi for premier club residents in the sky lounge. Therefore sky lounge is the main point for me to book their premier club room. The room was fine with bath tub and separate shower, clean and comfy . My room was facing the Marina Bay too, so it cheered you up every time when u looked out the window. Sky lounge services was brilliant, staff were all friendly and helpful. I was so amazed by their kind offer for me to bring a guest for free breakfast and free drinks at sky lounge everyday . However, I had no guests to bring over to enjoy the offer this time. They also provided free flow of alcohol and drinks including canapes from every night 6pm to 8pm, therefore everynight I would relax myself there after a long day work . Breakfast was served in sky lounge for me, although not many choices, it was acceptable with nice view and nice services . The hotel is very closed to city hall underground station, Raffles and Marina Bay. Paying this price for such a nice location was really worth it. For recreation part, this hotel had two swimming pools, gym and sauna. Although the swimming pools were not big, I enjoyed swimming in the fish tank swimming pool a lot.

We came in early and was hoping there would be an available room already. They said that the rooms are still be cleaned by the housekeeping. So we decided to have lunch first and left our bags in the Concierge. However, when we got back, our room is not yet ready! After almost an hour, we got our room keys. I was praying that we will get the renovated rooms because I read a lot of reviews saying that the rooms are not in good condition. Upon entering our room at the 11th floor (I just can't remember if it's in the Peninsula or the Excelsior building), I was happy to see that it's not that bad at all. Our room is big and clean as well as the bathroom. There was way enough space for our 2 big luggages. There's a small fridge and a safe, too. The bed is huge and we didn't have problems sleeping on it. Plus, we had a nice view from our room. When visiting Singapore, the best advice I can give is get a hotel near an MRT station because it's the fastest and cheapest way to go from one attraction to another.

Free Wi-fi There is a swimming pool & health centre which I did not use on this trip but looked clean & inviting.

Few times it looked a bit messy and food was kind of slopped around but I suspect it was that the hostesses could not keep up with the swarms of breakfast people. The internet costs 1 hour for SP$5 4 hours for SP$10 and up... taxi bookings through the concierge cost SP$2.50 surcharge.

Room was upgraded to a Premium corner room - massive room, lovely decor, perhaps a little tired on the paintwork. Views were great from each window and the bed and the bedlinen was wonderful. Lovely powerful shower and newly done out bathroom. The two pools are good (although one is right next to reception and is clear glass, so every Tom, Dick and Harry could watch you all day by the pool, were they so inclined). The pool on the side of the building is a good sun trap and has the sun pretty much all day. All the staff are fantastic and very friendly - other than the girl who \"greeted\" me for breakfast each morning. A more sour faced person I don't think I've ever met; a real shame as she completely lets the side down for all the others. I almost felt like I should apologise for having breakfast (which was, by the way, very good and plenty of choice). Location wise it was perfect for me as I had a couple of meetings in the business district - it's a maximum 10 minute stroll down to Boat Quay and Clarke Quay and the start of the business district. Very handy. I also walked up to Little India in about 25/30 minutes, which was a pleasant stroll. On the downside, the gym is pretty ropey (only one treadmill and only 3 weights machines (though lots of free weights)) and was far too hot. I happily run out an hour or so on the treadmill but couldn't get past 20 minutes due to the heat. I did bring this to someone's attention every day, but nothing changed. By far the worst thing about the hotel is the extortionate charges for the business centre - $10 (\u00a35) for 15 minutes and only open 9am to 5pm - pretty shocking for an international hotel that markets itself to international business people. Go outside the hotel and cross the road into the mall - downstairs is a good internet cafe that is $2 (\u00a31) an hour.

When we first checked in, we were about 30 minutes early and were told that if we came back later, our room in the Excelsior wing would be ready, which we were happy to do. But I did have to ask several times how long \u2018later\u2019 would be and never got an actual time. This was probably due to a language mix up, but we did disappear for over 90 minutes, only to come back and find that our room still wasn\u2019t ready. We offered to head out again (through our agent we had requested a double bed and non-smoking room and were willing to wait rather than take any available room), but the young gentleman kindly upgraded us to a premier room in the Peninsular wing instead. Our room was spacious enough which had heavy curtains to block out any light. The staff had simply put two single beds together, but after housekeeping came the next morning, they changed the sheets to a queen to get rid of the gap (without prompting) but funnily during our whole stay, they left us with two single doonas. At least I didn\u2019t have to fight with the wife over the blankets\u2026 The beds were very firm and although we had no problems sleeping, the middle of the bed (where the two singles joined) caused a bit of discomfort once you woke up after lying on it overnight. On the 15th floor, we had a great view of the Excelsior building, but we could also see some of the lights from Clarke Quay and the entrance to Fort Canning Park. Looking straight down, we had a good view of one of the swimming pools (and also the air-conditioning units of the building below). Our room was the very first room from the elevators and during our stay; we never heard the elevators at all, or a lot of street noise. Because the emergency services were located nearby, we did hear the odd siren and the odd hoon, plus the odd noisy guest walking by, but it was neither here nor there. We also heard plenty of guests letting their doors slam shut (for security purposes I understand, whereas we like to gently close our door and check to see that it\u2019s locked, so not to disturb other guests), plus we also heard some young kids crying in the next room a few times (again you can\u2019t expect rooms to be 100% soundproof). The premier room came with a huge safe, robes and slippers, flat screen TV (plenty of channels) a bar fridge that even at the coldest setting, took about a day to cool (not chill) any drinks. There wasn\u2019t a bottle opener in the room, so I had to head downstairs to a shop to purchase one and on a side note they provide you with pencils to write with, I assume so you can\u2019t steal their pens. We were also given a newspaper every morning to read, which came in handy whilst I was waiting for the wife to make herself beautiful. The bathroom was spacious enough with a few pros and cons. Firstly, the bathroom has a large glass window (with an adjustable blind) which is great if you like to watch TV whilst doing your \u2018business\u2019, but the shower doesn\u2019t have a curtain \u2013 just a partition that blocks about a third of the shower/bath recess. So after every shower, the bathroom floor was always soaking wet, which meant stepping out over the bath onto wet floor mats took a little bit of concentration. We rarely had to wait for an elevator too long and were pleased that your room key was also required to use the elevators above the reception floor. I spoke to concierge once to ask for directions and found him very helpful and informative. We really didn\u2019t use any other facilities in the hotel as we spent most of our holiday out and about. I did have to approach housekeeping one morning for an extra towel (as the wife wanted to wash her hair) and after asking housekeeping for a towel, I was given the impression that I was asking for too much. Breakfast was included in our package, but after the first 2 mornings we decided to eat out instead. It wasn\u2019t that the food was bad, it was just okay and we felt there were more interesting things to eat in Singapore. Plus it was very busy when we went down for breakfast and couldn\u2019t be bothered fighting for a clean or empty table. We had a bit of a mix up when they wanted to charge us for breakfast, but after checking again, realized that our breakfast was included. About the surrounding area, the nearest taxi stand is not right outside the doors of the hotel/s, but in fact in between the two and is also a communal taxi stand with the general public. The wait for a taxi isn\u2019t more than 5 minutes or so if there is a line (which there always seemed to be at night), but if it is raining and/or windy the wait may get uncomfortable. There are also major bus routes on both ends of Coleman Street and the MRT is only a few minutes stroll away. I should also mention besides the countless eateries nearby, there\u2019s a food court in Funan digital mall (IT), which is a cheap and tasty way to have meals. But be warned that it closes reasonably early for Singapore standards (we went there at 8.30pm and it was closed), so it\u2019s not the place for a late dinner or supper. Check-out was a simple process without any dramas and the staff was friendly enough. We weren\u2019t expecting great service because it is only a 3.5 star hotel, but were pleased one evening when a young staff member walking past stopped and greeted us with a hello and a smile, before walking off. It was the only time we really got that reaction, other than when we approached the reception desk. Also, be careful with your itinerary paperwork though \u2013 when we checked in, they kept it and filed it away, but we needed it for the second leg of our holiday. So after a simple photocopy it was all fixed. Would we stay here again? I\u2019m not sure \u2013 with the prices and options of hotels in Singapore and the fantastic bus, taxi and MRT system throughout the island, you\u2019re spoilt for choice. But I would happily recommend the hotel to anybody thinking about staying in a clean centrally located hotel.

It's only about $50 (AUD) extra per night and worth every penny. What a treat to be able to enjoy a couple of 'complimentary' cocktails and nibbles at day's end. It's a fantastic view from the lounge and Ivy and her team are absolute professionals. And... the Premier Club Rooms include free internet (cable) access. I should note that we stayed in the Peninsula Tower, not the Excelsior. I have a feeling the Peninsula has an edge.

But with Peninsula Excelsior, they have large rooms and they accommodated our family in just 1 room with an extra bed added. Even with the extra bed it was still spacious. We got a corner room and it had excellent views, even the kids were speechless. We arrived late at night and when we got to the room, we were pleasantly surprised to see the St. Andrew's Church, the Flyer and Marina Bay Sands. The kids just sat in front of the window and enjoyed the view. The booking was through email and was very easy and fast. Check in also very fast, as well as check out. The location is great, you can walk to Clarke Quay (which is beautiful at night) and we even walked to the Esplanade, Marina Bay up to the Sg Flyer (we are a family who don't mind walking). There's a mall at the same building of the hotel, also across. At the back is Funan Digital Mall for your digital needs where you can also find fast foods and cafes. We didn't need to avail of the hotel's breakfast because there are a lot of places to eat in the area. The MRT stop at City Hall is quite near but we didn't need to take it because the taxi rate is ok when there's 4 of you. There's a taxi stand in front of the hotel so we just took taxis to Chinatown, Sentosa and Singapore Zoo. One negative thing about this hotel is maybe the bathroom which we found to be too small for a 4-star hotel. There also was no free bottled water, maybe because they said that the water from the faucet is potable (but didn't taste good). Internet was available for a charge of SGD5 per hour which is ridiculous. Cable TV channels was also very limited - no channel for my kids. My son enjoyed swimming at one of the pools.

Room was on 20th floor with views over Fort Canning park, great for watching the afternoon rain storms come in and break over the hotel. Had a club room, although annoyingly this didn't include access to the Club Lounge on 22nd floor of the Peninsular Tower, which looked great on the hotel brochures and with lots of work to do, would've been a handy hangout. The room itself was lovely, if a little quirky. Giant comfortable bed, floor to ceiling window with great view, lots of light and fantastic nighttime view, too. Bathroom was well appointed and has a large window into the main room. This means you can sit in the bath, on the toilet and look out the window. A little odd, but. I quite liked the touch. Food-wise, only had breakfast at the hotel, which was pretty decent. However, the staff struggled to keep up with the number of guests hitting he breakfast buffet, meaning a hunt for tables, crockery and silverware on most days at peak times. Only downside to the hotel is the pool and gym, which are both at the lobby level, which means traipsing past check-in line and lobby bar if you've been to either. The pool has glass walls, which means sitting in the hotel lobby you can see everyone's legs thrashing about as they swim. Strange design choice, but I guess they're limited for space.

LOCATION The location was great for this hotel. It was 5 minutes walk to MRT (Raffles City) and to the shopping center. It was opposite of St. Andrews and right above Funan Digitallife Mall with many choices for eating on Level 1. Catching taxi were easy and usually no wait in the taxi queue. ARRIVAL We arrived at the hotel past 4:30pm for check-in. Reception Desk seemed to be a bit busy but checked us in promptly enough (about 10 minutes wait). We were very tired and were assigned a \"Deluxe\" room 1424 at the Excelsior Tower with two twin beds. ROOM The room was fine, nothing too special or fancy for the same star rating. It had two twin beds. We basically moved them together to make a single bigger bed so the kids won't roll off. Liked the window and window seat. It was quite cozy and one of the highlights of the room. Had in-room tea kettle with tea / instant coffee. Had mini bar/fridge. In-room safe. One funny thing about the room, it was lacking an iron and ironing board! No tub, just a shower with a window looking into the bedroom. Bathroom sink is too shallow for the installed faucet, water would spray everywhere on the counter (be careful if you're using the bathroom outlet as a charger). Another funny thing, NO clock in the room either. We had to call the front desk to ask for the local time instead. FYI - rollaway beds are S$30 per night. POOL(s) The hotel had two pools, both were unheated, but with the Singapore weather, not necessary either. The main pool is right in front of the lobby with a see-through bottom and nice waterfall feature. Our kids enjoyed it a lot and swam in it each evening after coming back from our exploration. It was about 5-6 feet deep max and minimum was about 3 feet deep. There was also a jet spray area with a window looking into the gym. The other pool is at the Excelsior side but its a still water pool. There wasn't anybody using it during our visit. It doesn't have any features just a basic pool comparing to the fancier one in the lobby. It oversaw the traffic down below instead. There is a restaurant or food service connected but again, nobody was using it. ROOM SERVICE We ordered room service for our last night in Singapore as we were too tired to go anywhere else and just wanted to relax with the kids. Ordered three items from the restaurant below (charges a 10% service charge - not too bad comparing to the States). However, the food was just OK. In fact, one dish, it was a seafood noodle, may be deemed inedible because it was so salty, like licking a block of salt. Yuck! The others were average, nothing spectacular about it, one was fish and chips for one and then an order of chicken satay. BREAKFAST BUFFET TIP If your reservation does not include the breakfast buffet and yet you want to try them out. Purchase breakfast vouchers at the Reception Desk for S$23++ per adult. If you go directly to the restaurant, you will be charged S$28++ (at least per the reception desk, we didn't try it out). HOTEL LOUNGE / POOL SERVICE We used the hotel lounge service twice. Once when we met up with a friend late-night and ordered drinks from the Hotel Lounge Bar for us to catch-up. Service was quick and prompt. Open quite late, perhaps 24/7, not sure. The other time, we ordered for off their snack menu (Calamari and Fried Potatoes) while kids and hubby were in the pool. Order was prompt and delivered right the pool and charged to the room. CONS * No Airport Shuttle. Have to arrange your own (either Taxi or Maxi Cab) * No complimentary internet. Either buy wireless for lobby use only (2 hour or 24 hour) OR pay for LAN line. * Housekeeping could be better - multiple times had to call and ask for extra towels and blankets/sheets. * Funky smell in the bathroom - one of the evenings upon returning, bathroom had a horrible sewage smell.

S$5 taxi ride to Marina Bay Sands building, walking distance to Singapore Flyer, Clarke Quay and many other delights. Arab St is good for fabric shops. We stayed with our twins, 22 yrs, who are Autistic, and got the connecting rooms we asked for. The only downside was S$150 deposit per room charged in case we ordered food.

The price (compared to others in the Clarke Quay area) seemed too good to be true and unfortunately it was. Singapore is certainly not a cheap city to stay in (compared to other SE Asian countries at least) but one expects that for around SG$200 a night a room should be at least clean and service to be even slightly welcoming (isn't that why the industry is called 'hospitality'?). NOT at the Peninsula Excelsior.... Check in was atrocious. The hotel is two hotels now combined and so you enter in either of the two original lobbies and catch the lift up to the 'new', combined lobby some four floors up. That is, of course absolutely fine except when we entered there were no fewer than three 'bellboys' / porters standing around at the counter. Not one looked up to greet us or offer assistance with out bags or directions to the lobby. We were 'greeted' at the Front Desk propre with a \"Yes?\".. Excellent start. The gentleman that checked us in did not smile once, was clearly appalled that two men would want a double bed and not a twin (even to the point of asking me if I was sure!) and brushed us off with not even a hint of a welcome or any offer of assistance or directions to our room. The rooms have recently been refurbished (apparently). We only paid for the lead-in room type ('Deluxe') and as I say, were not expecting luxury by any stretch of the imagination. The room was a decent size, furnished with a double bed only (low to the ground with an awful mattress and the worst pillows I've ever slept on), a desk (chipped and covered in greasy fingerprints) and a strange, narrow window seat, which was really only good for putting things on, not sitting on. The wardrobe was a decent size, huge safe and great air-conditioning (which housekeeping turned OFF every day). Plenty of TV channels and a decent-sized LCD TV. The bathroom was unbelievably filthy. The silicone around the sink was black with mould and behind the sink was covered in fluffy, mossy mould / limescale, which stayed there every day, despite telling Front Desk it needed to be removed (yes, I could have done it myself, but I really shouldn't have to). There were hairs in the bath when we arrived, the toilet seat wasn't attached correctly, the water pressure in the sink was pathetic and the shower screen was too short, so water flooded the floor every time we showered. On two of the four days we were there, towels had long, black hairs stuck to them. Both the bath and bed linen was thin, stained and clearly very old. The bathroom itself was tiny. On one of the days our room wasn't serviced and the paper was only delivered on two out of the four days we were there. Internet in the rooms is chargeable at SG$10 for 15 minutes! No thanks... Not once during our whole stay (four nights) did any of the staff ever greet us, open the door for us, or even just smile. Not once. There was always at least two staff lolling around in the entrance lobbies and they were hardly ever doing anything so it wasn't like they missed us walking past. I wasn't expecting a song or dance every time we entered the place, but it's a hotel; at least a smile or a 'Good Morning' would do! One day I rang the 'concierge' (a term they use loosely) to ask for directions to somewhere. He didn't know what I was talking about (his English was terrible which is fairly unacceptable in a guest services role in a country where English is one of the official languages and the language all education is taught in...) and so just hung up on me after umming and ahhhing. I know it seems like I'm having a rant, but the simple truth is a hotel should have clean rooms and friendly staff, no matter what you are paying to stay there. In this hotel the room was filthy and every single staff member we saw (and there was A LOT of them floating around) was not just unfriendly but completely ignorant unless approached first. If the room were clean and the staff even slightly more friendly it would have been decent value for money.

We arrived by 10am as scheduled and I already requested for early check in through sending them an email that we will be there early and I expect a swift check in. However, when the time we arrived, II waited for 1 hour standing in the front desk since the person handling our check in was a student intern without the supervision of a hotel staff.. We are 3 persons and she put us on a 2 single beds room and she reasoned out that there are no other rooms available yet for check in-- undermining the fact that I sent a previous email to them! She said that there is a sofa there which will compensate the two single beds. Well, I agreed halfheartedly and not to waste a lot of time arguing with her. We were located at the tower (I think the older part of the hotel); the elevator is freaky! It is old (the buttons are like 3 decades old), the carpet is freaking dirty! need vacuuming! When we arrived in our room, my first reaction was where was the sofa she's talking about? Ahh I guess that's one with the window! HELL NO! I will fall if I will sleep there! It is not even a sofa! It is just for seating purposes! Therefore I called the front desk and told me that they will give us an extra bed-- however until we checked out, no extra bed came to our rescue. I ended up sleeping with my mom (sideways, since we are afraid that one of us will fall). Another thing I noticed that the furniture are very tired already, they need replacement! the interior of the hotel is not that bad but need more refurbishment or better design. It is roomy but needs more decoration. I have no problems with outside noise. It is a good sleep though we are like in a can of sardines this time. For breakfast, there's few choices but it is tolerable. The food is fine no other comment for that. Check out? It took almost 45 minutes for me. It is really disappointing knowing that this should be a 4 star hotel (I guess the Capitol Hotel where we stayed in KL, which was only 3 star is so much better than this!) BUT FOR THE MOST PART, AT LEAST WE STILL HAD A NICE STAY IN SINGAPORE SINCE THE HOTEL HAS A VERY GOOD LOCATION. I hope that location will compensate all the bad things for this hotel.

The hotel location was fantastic but it was expensive for what it was. The room i was in was a corner room which overlooked Marina Bay - an absolutely fantastic sight to fall asleep to. Unfortunately the room had an inter-connecting door to the room next door and the soundproofing between rooms was pretty poor. On the other side of me must have been a cleaners store room because i regularly heard clattering dishes however it wasn't loud or constant enough to grate on my nerves. The MRT was a 2 minute walk away, as was a major shopping complex. The Esplande was also only a 15 minute walk from the hotel and the hotel was also part of a shopping complex in itself. The hop on/ hop off bus stations were right outside the hotel - 2 different stops for the two different operators that i saw who used those particular stops. The pool is in a pretty poorly planned spot and has a glass wall - which ordinarily would be fine but not considering it can be looked into from the main lobby of the hotel where the piano bar and checkin/ checkout desk is. The staff weren't particularly friendly and when i asked a question about the buses from the guy downstairs, he sent me next door to the tour desk. The guy at the tour desk was pretty rude and turned me away pretty quickly once i told him i only wanted advice on the bus and was not interested in booking a tour from him. all in all, it was a good enough hotel in a great location. i had heard Singapore was really expensive so i was prepared, but obviously not prepared enough as it cost me the same amount of money to say at this hotel as it did to stay at one of the Crown Casino hotels in Melbourne where the quality and service far exceeded the Peninsular in Singapore.

I had to email them a couple more times before they actually received our booking through from the Aust. agents. Once confirmed I was a little happier, but still unsure of what we would receive.

Good storage areas for our clothes so we could unpack for the week. Flat screen tv, but the quality not so good. Tiny bathroom, but it did the job, nicely refurbished, although no clothesline to dry handwashing. Didn't have any problem with paper thin walls. Never heard from neighbouring rooms.

I think all up we paid about $100 extra for a club room for 7 days as opposed to a standard room - a small price to pay for the excellent service we received. Breakfast in the Club lounge had enough variety to keep both of us happy, with meats (hot and cold), eggs (scrambled, omelet or made to order), rice or noodles, pancakes or french toast, fresh and preserved fruits, cereals, toast, tea, coffee, etc. Cocktails and snacks in the evenings were things like quail eggs and roe, marinated octopus, minced chicken on cucumber, fish or chicken satay - all quite tasty - and better yet - Free!. We were on the 21st floor, and heard no noise from any renovations. The beds were firm (which I like), there were two types of pillows to choose from, and we had two items laundered free each day - a bonus in the heat and humidty of Singapore.

It was well worth the wait, modern and comfortable and heaps of room for our family. The only complaint i would of had was that although our children are small, they had assumed that one of them would sleep in the queen size bed with us and told us there was only enough room for one single bed. The room could of easily taken a second rollaway bed, but as our children are little they topped and tailed anyway. Breakfast downstairs was priced not too bad on a budget and there was plenty of things to choose from. The hotel was handy to lots of things we wanted to see on a short break. One thing i would suggest though is not to book any tours through the downstairs tour agents. They were rude and did not disclose some information. We booked a tour and our son took ill the following day, when i tried to cancel they said i could but would forfeit 100% of the fee paid ( ie full price) I can understand a small percentage, even 20% withheld, but i felt 100% was really outrageous.

Our room was large with two windows (a corner room), a very large King bed, and we had an extra bed fit into the room, as it was very spacious. The bathroom was also large, with a separate shower and bath. The very major downside to having this large room was that it right next to the service lift, so neverending bells and dings could be heard throughout the night! Another downside to the hotel was slow service, and when we requested the extra bed, it wasn't given to us until the next day! This was where the housekeeping staff was kind of knocking on the door the next evening, and we were all just getting dressed out of the shower, standing in towels, whilst getting the kids dressed for bed. If I hadn't been standing there to holler \"Yes excuse me!!!\" while hearing someone enter the room without hearing any knock or bell beforehand I'm sure they would have entered under not so very nice circumstances!

Now that I have looked into the situation i believe that Quantas Holidays in conjunction with travel agents are in some way connected with certain hotels. My advice is this : If you want to stop its a great idea but BOOK YOUR OWN HOTEL ON-LINE. Find out the size of the room and make it quite clear what you need. I paid more for this room through the agent than I would have if I had booked it on-line. However, the managers of this hotel should take control of the situation and make sure that the room is adequate for the number of people staying - and certainly not expect 3 people whose ages were listed - to share a double bed!!.

It appeared to us that the work was happening on the 10th floor but we could easily hear it on the 15th floor we were on. We booked a triple room months in advance and arrived at the hotel at 4.00pm, well after the check in time of 2.00pm, to be told that our room was not available yet and we should go shopping for awhile. I had not advised them what time we would be checking in so the room should have been ready from 2.00pm. I told the girl behind the desk that I was travelling with my elderly mother (78 years) and we had been travelling all day between airports since 8.00am that morning and that she was very tired and needed to rest so please hurry with the room. We were given 1 free non alcoholic drink voucher for the lobby bar which was a small glass of weak fruit juice or could have even been cordial. I was told that they would come and get us from the lobby when the room was ready. We noticed other people waiting in the lobby with the same drink. After an hour I approached the desk again to be told no the room is still not ready. I voiced my complaint yet again but was told to please wait. After another half an hour, it is now 5.30pm and we have waited an hour and a half in the lobby I return to the desk and finally the room is ready but no one came and got us. We go up the lift and although I booked a non-smoking room as soon as the lift doors open we are overwhelmed with cigarette smoke. We push on and open the door of our room to find that it was a room reeking of cigarette smoke and it has a double bed in it even though I booked a twin room with an extra single bed. We did a quick U turn and returned to the reception desk to be told we are booked out but we will bring in another bed and \u2018refresh the room to remove the smoke smell\u2019. Any of you who do not smoke know it is impossible to remove the smoke smell from a room that is heavily used as a smoking room. I argued that my mother has Asthma and there is no way she can stay in that room but I continued to get \u201cwe are fully booked\u201d. If I had not paid for the room in advance I would have walked out long ago so gave up on this girl and asked for the Manager. He finally arrived and after a long discussion with him he finally found us another room which was smaller in size but on a non-smoking floor. No compensation was offered to us for this like a free lunch/dinner or even a free alcoholic drink or even a room upgrade. So after waiting an hour and a half for this room we get there to find: \u2022 Twin beds \u2013 great but they have been pushed together so have to call Housekeeping to get them separated and the bedside tables rearranged. \u2022 Another bed has to be delivered \u2013 that takes another 45 mins \u2022 The electronic key tag that you place the card in does not work so no electricity in the room \u2013 that takes an hour to fix as the reader is faulty not the cards \u2022 The room safe does not work, batteries are dead \u2013 that takes an hour for new batteries to be delivered and installed. We finally got out of our room after all the repairs and problems at 7.45pm to go for dinner. When we go to check out I am told that I have to pay for the internet I have used in my room. I argue that nowhere does it say in the room or in the room manual that there is a cost for the internet so I am not paying. They certainly were not going to get any more money out of me. Next to me at the desk are 2 guys arguing that they booked a twin room and have been given a double bed. I hear the usual \u201cWe are fully booked\u201d so I lean over and tell them we have just booked out of our room which is a twin so that is available to them. On passing through the lobby on other days we notice many people sitting with their bags and the free drink and this is late in the day. It appears that this hotel is well under staffed in cleaning staff and make guests wait for their rooms. The annoyance is that they will not tell you how long you have to wait and at the price you pay for this hotel the service needs to be much better. We also stayed at the Pan Pacific Singapore which I could not fault on anything so my advice is give the Peninsula Excelsior a big miss and go to the Pan Pacific. It is a shame that this hotel\u2019s service is so bad as the views from our room were fantastic and even the room was OK but I would not put up with this bad service again.

From looking at other reviews I saw that the hotel has a wide variety of room standards so I made my preference clear at reception: a good view, cleanliness, 24/7 free internet access and away from the ongoing refurbishment noise. The room looked to have been refurbished about four years ago and so the bathroom was showing signs of needing regrouting/descaling but was clean enough so I did not have to return to reception to change rooms. Plus point: there was a large safe in the wardrobe which would hold small laptops and other cumbersome valuables. The hotel is busy and you meet people from all walks of life in the lifts and lobbies. Don't expect staff to anticipate your every need and jump to carry your luggage or open your taxi door (the taxi rank is directly outside), but if you ask, they are generally very helpful. The breakfast is disappointing in quality by Singapore standards, but there is plenty of it, including fresh pineapple and water melon and someone on hand to cook your eggs how you want them, though you may have to hunt for a fork. Tip: there is a quieter breakfast room opposite the lifts if you are not one for madding crowds. The rooms are serviced with fresh linen and towels daily though you will have to phone for an iron and ironing board. Tip: befriend the housekeeper on your floor. Plus point: the air-con is easy to control. Room service food is disappointing, but plenty of places to eat just a minute's walk away, including Chimes and Raffles, Indian set-meal cafes, and a Starbucks-clone cafe below. If you are a photographer you will be pleased to know that Cathay - the only safe, intelligent place to buy higher-end photo equipment (unless you are cleverer than the wily merchants) - is just opposite in Peninsula mall, and there are some friendly second-hand dealers in the basement of the Adelphi, also opposite.

In many respects, this customer service is unacceptable. Why didn't the hotel upgrade us straight away when they made a mistake allocating rooms? I am also surprised that smoking rooms are still available. Even so, the premier room was hardly inviting, and we could still detect smoking on a supposedly non-smoking floor. Lift wait times was also long, but after reading many reviews, it was to be expected. There was only two things that were positive about this hotel. Firstly, its the location. Right in the city, and very close to the 'city hall' mrt. Also, there is a taxi 'Q' right outside. Secondly, we had a very discount rate, which made it more acceptable.

Reception area always seemed understaffed with queues and two times we waited over 20 minutes. It is also strange that the reception are is on the 6th floor. Our room was a corner room on the 19th floor and did have fantastic views. The room had a king size bed but the decor was tired looking. We had requested a no smoking room and were quite put out when we discovered we were on a smoking floor. The smell hit you as soon as you exited the lift. (I can't believe anywhere nowadays allows smoking inside). When we went back and queried this were were told it was because we checked in early (why did I book this package?) We were told that to change rooms they could only offer a smaller room with a smaller bathroom. Smaller bathroom? The bathroom was the worst bathroom in a hotel I have ever stayed in. The only floor area was where the door opened. The worst thing was that there was no proper shower, just a hand held shower head, placed at about thigh level. We opted to not move if the room was going to be worse. Lunch in the Coleman room was OK, but the nibbles in the Sky Lounge were aweful. Cold mini spring rolls and fried mini fish and chicken pieces. Our dinner was also in the Sky Lounge and we had been told there was no kitchen there and the food needed to be brought up. I think it came via the stairs. The soup although nice was barely lukewarm, the roll was rock hard and we couldn't even get a knife into it. The main meal also was not hot. We opted to have breakfast in the Sky Lounge next morning (a mistake) and everything was cold although in bain maries. We can only assume that the food had already cooled before being placed there. We overheard some interesting conversations while waiting in line. One woman had booked for the night before as her plane was due in at 5.00 am. It was late by 3-4 hours and when she got there she was told the room was not ready. They had no answer when she asked how this could be when she had already paid for it. Another person was complaining that their toilet had not worked since their arrival the day before despite continous phone calls. We had a late flight out and the girl in the club lounge told us we were welcome to stay there and rest until leaving for the airport. We thought well maybe this will make up for everything. However at 6.00 we were told we were only entitled to tea or coffee. Would it really have hurt them to give my husband a beer, after all we had paid $350 for the night. Positives of the stay - the view from our room and the Sky Lounge were spectacular. The girls in the Lounge were excellent and couldn't be more helpful.

The bathroom was a bit tight and you had to sidestep to get out of the door. The shower was located within the bath and when you put the shower on, the screen directed the water along the sides of the bath which in turn flooded the floor - I don't mean just a little bit - about 50% of the water went onto the floor. As the floor was tiled, it was exceptionally slippery and dangerous. The plumbing had a lot to be desired - if anyone used the toilet in the room upstairs, you knew exactly what they were doing - this did not lead to a good night's sleep. I'm not sure whether they are doing anything about this during the refurb - they certainly need to.

The first night I was put in a room in the Peninsula tower. This tower has not had any rooms renovated and they need it. The sheets were clean, absolutely no complaints about the bed or pillows and the room generally was clean but the carpet was disgusting - very dirty and my feet were black from walking on it. The bathroom was tiny but OK, a tile falling off the bath but the basin was fine, no mould or cracks. The toiletries were OK (not fancy but fine for one night). Breakfast wasn't included in my room rate so I ate around the corner. The second night's stay I was put into the Excelsior wing, which has had rooms renovated above the 17th floor (I'm pretty certain that's the floor level) because I complained to the receptionist about the first room and said I didn't want the same dirty room. I was given a renovated room, non-smoking (smoking rooms smelt badly) and in very good condition however the renovations were carpet, soft furnishings, walls etc but there was still excessive poly filler around the bathroom which hadn't been renovated. All in all this room was a vast improvement on the first room. As a travel agent I assess rooms all the time to see if they can be recommended to my clients and my reason for choosing this hotel was its excellent location and price. The location is brilliant because it is almost adjacent to City Hall, Raffles Plaza, City Link Mall (and therefore Suntec City) and a short bus ride up to Orchard Road. It is an easy walking distance to Clark Quay and Boat Quay (for dinner). Would I recommend this hotel? Well, if the price is right for you, take it but be sure to ask for a renovated room if possible and if not possible, don't hesitate to ask for a clean room if you're given a doozy like I was.

We also had an issue with ants and the the thermostat in the room made a horrible noise, it didnt matter whether i turned the temperature up, down or even off, it still buzzed constantly! by 11pm (12hours after i first reported it and 5 visits to reception) someone eventually came to look at it and after making a lots of excuses they left. about half an hour later i had a phone call from reception saying that the deputy manager has suggested that we moved rooms. we only ended up moving to the room opposite but it was so much better, although the exact same room, there were no ants and the no buzzing theremostat!!

The location is excellent for shopping etc and is less than 5 minutes from bus stops on adjacent Hill St/North Bridge Rd and the City Hall underground train stop. Overall, the hotel was good, but was let down by the claustrophobic and hectic breakfast area and the serviceability of the lifts. It has all the expected room facilities and cleanliness. The bathroom had a bath (some hotel bathrooms don't !), there was aircon and a HUGE safe-deposit box (so big I accidentally left several things behind in it as I missed them....). A bad point for me was that the in-room drinks provisions did not include milk but only powdered 'creamer', which is horrible with tea.... The 1st-floor reception area is massive and centrally located between the 2 hotel room 'towers' (the Peninsula and Excelsior); whilst there are 3 lifts serving each tower there was always at least one broken, usually 2, whilst we were there making transport to/from the rooms VERY lengthy and frustrating. As soon as a lift was repaired (usually within 8 hours or so) it, or another, would break - totally unsatisfactory for such a busy/large hotel. I found the knowledge of the Front Desk staff limited, but bizarrely the Business Centre staff were an excellent alternative ! The breakfast buffet was OK, with quite a wide choice of basic foodstuffs; there was an eggs 'cook-to-order' section, something I like a lot. However, the dining area and walking areas around the food section were quite small/narrow, making for an unpleasant dining experience when combined with the large number of residents scrambling for breakfast. There was an extremely small outside dining area, but I think the humid/hot weather would limit how attractive this might be to residents..... As with shopping, due to the central location lunch/dinner are easily obtainable at the huge array of local food outlets.

By this stage I was desperate for a shower & a change of clothes but it took 2 phone calls & another hour before my bags arrived at my room! Hindsite says I should have gone & retrieved them myself! I took a bath and when I drained it, the bathroom totally flooded with water coming up through the floor drain. The TV also wasn't working so I reported both items to the reception as I left for my next outing of about 4 hours. Upon my return (now 9pm local time & no sleep for the past 24hrs) I soon discovered that both faults were still not rectified. Two phone calls & one hour later I was able to finally get some much needed sleep. The breakfast buffet left alot to be desired as far as price versus quality goes. Also the temperatures of the dishes left alot of questioning in regards to food hygiene & safety. During the course of that day, for some reason, housekeeping removed all the contents from my mini-bar - strange!!", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tokyo, Japan", "Title": "\u201cHorrible stay at Hotel but good location\u201d", "Author": "VinChin08", "ReviewID": "UR19589483", "Content": "I have just returned from Singapore after 4 night stay in this hotel.

It was a promise kept and a birthday gift also to my girlfriend-- Ners--why we went to the Lion City in the first place. We really had the most difficult time trying to book for a hotel as most of the hotels in Singapore were fully booked (they said there was an international meeting of sorts going on that time). Anyway, when all hope was lost, our travel agent called me up to say she was able to booked us at the Peninsula Excelsior. So there we stayed for five days (October 20-24, 2007) and simply just had the most wonderful time--both in the hotel and in Singapore too! Checking in, we were upgraded, free of charge, by this petite Indian lady receptionist (Sharon, I think was her name) to a room at the 16th floor Excelsior tower. The room we stayed at offers an excellent view of the city, and was pleasantly made-up by the lady in charge of the 16th floor during our whole stay. To add, for a country with not much water resource--the water in the T & B was strong (though the bath tub could really use a fix--draining the water takes so much time). Well, yes, by the way, I hope they reconsider the prices of the stuff they offer at the mini-bar. It's really quite expensive as mentioned by another traveller. Anyway, I can't help it but just mention it here--what really almost put down our spirits in our trip to Singapore? The airline we used! I hate that airline so much! It's Jetstar Asia! Goodness, the interior was dirty, the stewardess impolite! Grrr... Their stewardess ruin the name of the profession! Instead of smiling, their faces seem to hate their work! Grr. Anyway, don't want to end this review with a sad note, so to Peninsula Excelsior, which is just so near to everything you want to visit in Singapore, thanks for the accomodation and hope to be back in your hotel!

The pool is directly opposite the reception desk (behind glass windows so we were reluctant to swim because the world was watching you!)

On a brighter note, the hotel was close to facilityies including shopping centres, river, train station and I can say that our tour booking agent in the hotel lobby (Dan) was wonderful. The tours were great too.. really enjoyed the laser show at Sentosa Island and the half day tour of the city (this takes in the likes of China town, little india and the botanic gardens.. a short trip and this gives you an idea of where you would like to go back to).

Absolutely no help on accomodating us in another room even though requested twice. I have sent my grievences to the Singapore Stopover Agency, but I dont know if it will help. Based on my experience this hotel should be blacklisted from the Stopover hotel list.", "Date": "January 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "16 Harbour Parade Buddina", "Title": "\u201chatred of a stinking dirty room\u201d", "Author": "ronmarg", "ReviewID": "UR6354778", "Content": "My Wife and I have stayed at the Excelsior Hotel on many occasions over the past 10 years. and again on 15 th August 2006 When it has been most satisfactory.

On arrival the lobby appeared refurbished and well presented, unfortunately that is where the experience ended. Our room was on the 16th floor of the Excelsior tower. This is quite possibly the worst hotel room i have ever seen. I don't even know where to begin. The linen was stained and cigarette burns on it, the toilet would not flush, there was copious amounts of mould in the bathroom. The front door and the door to the bathroom where falling off there hinges. To my partner and I we could not believe the state of the room, the only good thing was the view of Boat Quay. Needless to say we got no response when we rang reception to complain about the state of the room. So first thing to do was visit internet cafe and find alternate accommodation. Unfortunately we had to spend the first night in this hellhole as we did not find any other accommodation till the following night. If we had to stay in this hotel for the whole 5 nights our visit to Singapore would have been the worst ever. The breakfast provided on the first morning was about as good as we thought, that is terrible. All I can say is DONT DO IT if you are thinking of staying here.

I would have to say that this is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. To start with my husband and I were given two tiny single beds that we were told to 'push together' if we wanted to. The bathroom was dirty and covered with mould and the grout in the tiles was peeling off everywhere. The toilet was extremely difficult to flush, sometimes taking 10 or 11 goes. The water pressure in the shower was so strong that a child or elderly person would have had trouble standing up and the heat temperature fluctuated between luke warm to absoultely burning hot - very dangerous. The walls are so thin that we lay there at night listening to other people 'doing things' in other rooms, people flushing the toilet, having conversations that we could clearly hear across the hallway etc. The rooms are very run down and require renovating. The money has been spent on the foyer and one of the pools - not that we got to use this as there was maintenance going on. We used the second pool and this was very dirty, pool chairs dirty etc. The fitness centre was great with the latest equipment, state of the art everything. Service at the restaurant was terrible and extremely slow, food was ok except for the blow fly that was in the bottom of my husbands milkshake. I think that this hotel spoilt our trip to Singapore as we had a negative feeling right from the start. I had read other reviews on this site but thought 'oh it can't be that bad' but let me tell you - STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE. I consider myself a pretty easy going person and am tolerant to most things but have never had such an awful experience.
