Our room (marketed as a super deluxe something or other) was in the old building and was delightfully light and Venitian, if a tad compact. However the canal noise early the next morning led us to ask to be moved the next day which the Danieli did, and upgraded us, to a room which was actually a bit more homogenous executive style (but quiet) so that was great too. The reception staff and the concienrge staff were friendly and helpful at all times. Here's the downside for us..... dinner attracted a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac16 cover charge each - now this may be fine sitting on the terrace on a summer evening, but on a rainy April night shut indoors, I did not feel this was worth it (Go to the Londra Palace for dinner instead).

Far from it. For a \"luxury collection\" hotel, this hotel seems to manage to a different set of standards. Service was satisfactory in some areas but very poor in others. Among the worst i've experienced at a Starwood and I've been to dozens of SPG properties around the world. Good things: helpful concierges, great bell hops, good location. Poor things: inattentive front desk reception, poor room service, even the nicer rooms are terrible. I'm an SPG gold and was told I received a \"double upgrade\" The room was extremely tiny, faced into another building, and had an uncomfortable bed, tiny closet and desk. Even for venice this room seemed like the most basic of rooms. When asking the reception desk about it, they said they had no better rooms available. When logging onto the WiFI and begin taken directly to their site, I decided to check. Turns out there were much improved rooms that were larger with lagoon views available that day and the following day during my stay. The hotel wasnt booked up! When bringing this up with the reception, they were completely rude and said the hotel was 100% sold out. Even though it wasn't. They were suspiciously defensive in saying it too. I don't blame reception as much as management because they are probably trained to not upgrade SPG customers. They claimed they would talk to the manager and get back to me the next morning, at which point I could pay a surcharge for a lagoon view room. They never called me the next AM. They also failed to replace waters from the mini fridge and when I requested it, they said they would be right up and never came. Hands down, this property doesn't care about or honor SPG starwood status and for those of us who travel and spend our time picking out starwood properties, we should receive the benefit of the room upgrades. The service at reception was hands down the worst I've had at a hotel, even much lower grade hotels. A particular woman ignored us, and treated us very rudely during our stay. Worst service in Italy. The concierges were very helpful though and attentive which really made for a better experience. For a luxury property charging as much as they do you expect so much more. If you see Frederica at the front desk when you check in avoid her in particular. we walked up to her to ask a question a couple times and she didnt even make eye contact or say \"be right with you\" she just stared at her computer screen.", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Columbia, SC", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful hotel with great location\u201d", "Author": "GrizSC", "ReviewID": "UR128008686", "Content": "Stayed here with my wife and two teen children.

The restaurant really, definitely, 100% wasn't (more of that later). But I booked this because I like 5 star hotels, because the location, 3 minutes from St Marks Square, is fantastic and because, well, it's The Danieli. First impressions were fab - we got a private water taxi from the airport and I'd really recommend it, it's such an amazing way to arrive and worth every penny (about 100 euros) and they dropped us right at the door where a liveried doorman took our bags. The lobby is beautiful in an old fashioned splendour kind of way - there are loads of photos of it on here - and the check in process was efficient and friendly. We had 2 connecting rooms, without a view, sadly, as there were none available when we booked, but each had a small balcony, which was nice. I've no idea how they compare to the size of other Venice hotel rooms but there were 2 chairs, a small table and a writing desk in each room. Both rooms were the 4th category up so 2 luxury doubles. Bathrooms are fine but the literature was dog earred and tatty and the previous guest's itineriaries were stuffed in there - not what you expect really. There was an chocolate easter bunny in each room though and my children were pleased with that. Another minor gripe - there's a 15 euro charge for internet access in the rooms although this is free in the lobby for some bizarre reason and I do think this is unreasonable - we paid nearly a grand a night, c'mon, throw in some wi-fi! It might even be per device too so if you're taking 2 ipads or laptops that might translate to 30 euros per 24 hours, but I could be wrong, worth checking. Our wi-fi didn't work the first day but they sorted it pretty efficiently so that was fine. We ate in the restaurant on the first night and I wish we hadn't: this was hotel dining room food at Le Manoir prices: 4 main courses (1 ravioli, 2 x mixed fish,1 Wagu beef, which I appreciate was the most expensive dish on the whole menu, at 64 euros), 3 puddings, 1 ordinary bottle of wine and it came to about 450 euros and was really fairly unimpressive. To explain - the veg garnish on my plate was dried up and curling, the fish and pasta were nothing to write home about, ditto the puddings. So although there was nothing actually terribly wrong with it, gourmet food it was not. And we've eaten in Michelin starred restaurants - there's no comparison. I guess we were paying for the glorious view over the lagoon, the service and the fact that it's Danieli. The breakfasts on the other hand are served in the same dining room and are much, much better. The views are still there, the service is friendly and the buffet choice is vast. Bacon, sausages, waffles, fruit, smoked salmon, cereal, croissants - a huge choice and there's something for everyone. We found the waiting staff in the lobby (in white jackets! It was like being in Casablanca!) and the concierge very helpful so the service is decent enough here, as you'd expect. And it is a beautifully calm hotel and it was lovely being able to pop back to grab a scarf / rest for an hour / enjoy the hotel because of the marvellous central location. We had a fabulous time and enjoyed Venice enormously but I'm not convinced the prices are worth it.

I had been sent here on business with a group of journalists. The weather was unusually warm for March, but the hotel itself was acting as if it was December. The rooms were unbearably stuffy and about eight of us failed to get any decent amount of sleep on the first night because our rooms were too stuffy. We all opened our shutters and windows (which meant that light could enter, and noise). We were then all awakened several times in the night (when we did snatch short bursts of sleep) by the sound of rubbish/recycling being collected from the canal outside. When we complained the following morning, we were told that the air conditioning was not turned on in the hotel 'because of the regulations in Italy.' Allegedly until the end of March they have to heat the hotel! But before I could respond to this, the manager put the phone down on me. There was absolutely no sense that as customers we were valued by the hotel, which clearly coasts on its out-of-date reputation as an excellent Venetian destination. I have stayed in five-star hotels all over the world and the cavalier attitude of the Concierge and desk staff and the manager to the serious matter of the hotel being too hot to sleep in was extraordinary, not least because as journalists we have the opportunity to spread the word very rapidly about their complete lack of concern for customer comfort. No apology, no 'we wish we could help if we could' - just downright rudeness. The common parts of the hotel were roasting. The rooms themselves were unbearably hot, and the only way to cool the room in any way was to open both shutters and windows. Each time I saw the maid, I asked if the windows could be left open. Every time I returned to my room, the windows were shut again. In all my years of travel I have never encountered such a ridiculous and uncomfortable situation.

Imagine staying the same hotel as the Dodge of Venice once walked! You must really look at this hotel, not judge it quickly. The suite we stayed in was in the Excelsior section, non smoking and relatively recently renovated. It was wonderful, fresh exotic flowers, marble bathroom, with everything anyone would want, a bottle of wine, chilled on arrival, everything perfect, comfortable beds, and in the most desired place in Venice, imagine. The staff where very accomodating, and pleasant. As it was New Year's Eve, many security people around making sure the hotel was for the hotel guests, which is nice. We walked outside the door to see the fireworks of New Year's Eve, beautiful, and then returned to the bar for a glass of champagne to toast the New Year, how perfect can an evening be? The only criticism would be the check in and check out time. It is too lengthy. I think it is connected to the Italian beauracracy, everything takes too much time. However, if you can be patient the results are wonderful. I think there is no place on earth with more class than the \"sophisticated\" end of Italy.

We are Starwood Preferred Guest Platinum and had a very good experience when we made our reservation and were assured we would receive a room with a water view upon check in. This is not an inexpensive city, folks, so adjust your expectations accordingly. As we were arriving by train from Rome with several pieces of luggage, we decised to splurge on a private water taxi with an escort from the Danieli from the train platform to the water taxi area, about 80 euro. Worth every penny! It was pouring rain and \"acqua alta\" (high tide) when we arrived. As soon as we stepped off the Eurostar Italia onto the platform, we were greeted by the escort from the Danieli with a porter to take our bags to the taxi and umbrellas. She was delightful and gave us several recommendations for neighborhoods to \"get lost in\". Check-in did not start off well, with a disinterested and slightly grumpy desk clerk, but as soon as he saw our Platinum status, we were whisked off to a desk with a delightful young lady, Fernanda, who completed our check-in and escorted us to our beautiful suite in the 17th century building, which is still beautiful. Our suite was on the corner with 2 \"Juliet\" balconies facing the Grand Canal. Four rooms, high ceilings, antique furniture, marble bathroom, Murano glass light fixtures and a bottle of Prosecco on ice; what's not to love? The second level Riva Degli Schiavone-facing location was a bit noisy, but we loved every minute of it. The room key was an actual key with a brass topped silk tassel attached which we had to leave with the desk each time we left the hotel, which they would put in a little wooden cubby hole. Some would find this annoying; I found it charming. SPG Platinum members who are accustomed to the St. Regis brand may be disappointed. The hotel is very old, encompasses 3 palazzi, and is not what you would call \"polished\": the floors slope, the furniture is old and not terribly comfortable, it is incredibly easy to get lost in here, but come on, folks, you're in Venice! When else can you experience a hotel such as this? If you're looking for a pristine, sparkling, boring hotel, book somewhere else.

This hotel is right next to Piazza San Marco on the Venice lagoon. So while it's a great location it is in a very busy tourist area.I recommend arriving in a Water Taxi. We paid 60 euro from the train station but it is a special experience. We used the Vaporetto (water bus) to return to the station which worked out since there was a storm and the larger water bus cuts through the chops easily. The Vaporetto was only 6.5 euro per person and since we had no oversize luggage there were no extra charges. Both the water taxi and water bus drop you off close to the hotel. As you may have read already the lobby of the hotel while kind off small is breathtaking. This is true for most of Venice. The entire city around every corner is like being in a beautiful painting. We had a Junior Suite but were upgraded to an Executive Suite due to my Platinum status. We went to see the room and it was great except that it din't have a water view or step out balcony. A smaller version of Angela Jolie's room in \"The Tourist\" with no view of the lagoon. We asked if we could trade our room for a room facing the lagoon with a balcony. Marco who checked us in said he would try his best to find us the lagoon facing balcony room. He even had a heated argument with this angry looking woman who sat at a desk across from reception. It appeared she had no intention of letting us have the room but Marco was persistent. After this exchange between them he was happy to tell us that while it was not a suite he had lagoon facing balcony room becoming available and that he would find us on the terrace when it was ready. We enjoyed our drinks on the terrace while watching the busy lagoon and street below. As he said Marco took us to our new room and wow! The view and balcony were magnificent. If you seen the pictures you know this hotel has a very limited number of lagoon facing balcony rooms but at 27,000 Starwood points per night we were paying a lot to stay there. Our luggage had not been transferred to our new room so we went down to the lobby because it is such a beautiful space instead of calling down. While we were there I again asked weather breakfast was included with our room and Marco was not sure. We wound up speaking with the angry looking woman at the little desk. She informed us that because we paid with points breakfast was NOT included with our rate. She also implied that this was a \"Luxury Collection\" hotel and that I did not understand what a \"Luxury Collection\" hotel. I'm sorry but I'm a platinum member and I very well understand what \"Luxury Collection\" hotels are and have stayed at many. She did not seem to care to accommodates us in anyway, including telling us about any discounts we might have because of my Starwood status. She then began to tell me it was my settings on my iPhone that was the reason I could not access the WiFi. What 4-5 star hotels tells the customer that they are at fault without trying to provide any help or assistance? This woman should be removed from her position and have no access to customers. Being pleasant to her only returned an \"I can step all over you\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" type of attitude. I am in IT and I knew that my issues had nothing to do with settings on my iPhone. If we return to Hotel Danieli it will not be because of her but we will look at other hotels because of her. In fact I will be contacting Starwood about her rude attitude. We plan on returning to Venice but probably not the Hotel Danieli because of her! Now more about the hotel. Other than Marco, service at this hotel is 4-star and not 5-star. This included issues with our key when it stopped working and we had to wait while three different people came to our door trying to get it to work. The apology was mixed with \"somehow we must have not known how to work the key\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" even though it took three people over 20 minutes to get the key to work. Nothing else was said or done for use about this inconvenience. Summary: - Beautiful historic grand hotel - Excellent location next to Piazza San Marco on the Venice lagoon - Operates more as a 4 - 4 1/2 star hotel not a 5-star - Marco at the reception desk is wonderful and improved our stay - Nice, well appointed rooms with beautiful bathrooms - Very expensive - Disgusting bathrooms on the lobby floor - Doorman is usually absent - Good concierge service", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Mexico City, Mexico", "Title": "\u201cSimpli the BEST\u201d", "Author": "JorTC", "ReviewID": "UR119594253", "Content": "The first time I stayed at Danilie was some 25 years ago, afterwards I visited Venice a couple of time and stayed at different hotels.

This is what makes Danieli unique in its kind: it's all real and genuine. Staff is charming and would do anything to please you. Some people complain about the prices. Well, it's Danieli for starters... Then never forget you're in Venice which is not the cheapest city in the world.

The Hotel Danieli embodies these traits in bucketloads I am afraid to say. On the positive side our room had a lagoon view in the modern part of the hotel and the vista is simply stunning. The room is well appointed, modern and was kept clean. However, the balconies on these rooms afford no privacy with screens between neighbours barely at waist height. Part of the attraction of staying here was to experience a dinner in the La Terazza restuarant overlooking the lagoon. Our tour operator booked a table for us for two nights a good six months in advance. However, there was a conference going on during our stay featuring the European Armies Group and they had commandeered the whole of the public restuarant La Terazza and therefore hotel residents had to make do with being shunted into a side room where you couldn't look out of the window when you were sitting down to eat. Furthermore, my wife and me were charged in excess of 255 euros for a 2 course meal & wine which is eye-wateringly expensive. Don't get me wrong I will pay good money if the food and ambience is worth it but this is a rip-off. The trouble is so many folk come to Venice and such hotels can charge what they like and not try very hard because there will always be another mug punter coming along. We cancelled our second reservation and decided to eat out at the Londra Palace a short way along the front. We arguably had a better meal, service and atmosphere and it was almost just over half the price of the Danieli. A word about breakfast, which is served from a buffet. This did take place in the roof top restaurant and the view was special. However, the full English cooked breakfast was just.... well disgusting as it was stone cold despite being in a warming area. All the staff (and there are alot of them) had to do was serve coffee, allocate tables and clear plates, but the expression \"busy doing nothing\" comes to mind and it all seemed a bit shambolic.

When we arrived at the hotel the porter took our bags and escorted us over to reception, where we checked in. The man on the desk gave us a map and booklet about Venice before escorting us to our room whilst the porter brought up our baggage. Although our room was far less grand than the one assigned to Angelina Jolie in the film, it was very nice.The room was in the newer building and overlooked a small canal rather than the Grand canal. I did ask the hotel if we could pay for an upgrade to a canal view but the only rooms they had free, were suites which were way outside our budget. However the room we got was clean, quiet and very comfortable with a small entrance lobby, leading into the bedroom and through an arch where the wardrobes were, was another room containing a very well appointed bathroom with a wonderful shower . The bed was large and the pillows fluffy. When the maids came to turn down the bed (& leave chocolate on the pillow) they rang the door bell outside the room, which I thought was a nice touch. Breakfast was taken on the Terrace on the 4th floor of the hotel with a spectacular view of the Grand Canal. Unlike other reviewers we had no problems getting seated on the Terrace as there was a Maitre D to escort guests to their tables. The waiters were excellent and very attentive. We were on a full breakfast basis and found breakfast was excellent and very plentiful with really lovely pastries as well as cooked food & fresh fruit. You could also have omlettes made to order. We didn't need to ask the concierge for very much but they were always polite and helpful.

Overall it is a spectacular hotel, having been a palace with original construction in 1400. Of all the hotels in Venice, it gives the distinctive Venetian old-world feel. During both stays we were given rooms with balconies. There are a limited number of rooms with views on the water. We had a partial view during our last stay and a view of the tops of local buildings in the previous stay, both of which were fine. The balconies are constructed in such a way to afford privacy and are quite nice.There is sufficient dresser and closet space, the rooms are decorated in a sumptuous fashion and the bathrooms are spacious with plenty of amenities. Some decorations are slightly faded or worn, but this adds to the antique feel which is far more comfortable and pleasant than hard, antiseptic, modern edges. The beds themselves and pillows are extraordinarily comfortable, and the hotel itself is pleasantly quiet, with minimal bustle down in the lobby, except for when the occasional celebrity is expected to come through. And why wouldn't they want to come through? it is simply a beautiful hotel unlike any other. The first thing to note about the service is that housekeeping in particular is excellent. Non-intrusive, pleasant people who do an excellent job and do not forget to refresh missing amenities, nor are they disruptive, calling the room as in some hotels. The breakfast which is included (on the covered roof or indoors) includes fresh fruit, wonderful baked goods, juices and champagne. The eggs could have used a bit more cooking, but made-to-order eggs are possible. The personnel in the restaurant were all first-rate, and we admired their poise considering the large number of guests to cater to. The reception area personnel were also seasoned professionals who helped us immensely in choosing sights, entertainment and restaurants to enjoy, as well as navigating our way towards it. When we arrived at our scheduled dinner or opera, which the Danieli handled with precision on our behalf, we were welcomed heartily as Danieli guests. One exclusive restaurant even accommodated us without a reservation because we were Danieli guests. The only downsides were: firstly, a small, unexpected fee that guests in any hotel must pay for Venice restoration; we wish we were told at the time of booking. It was new at the time,; it is likely when you book you will be informed. Besides that an employee came to work with the flu and passed it to me while assisting me with the hotel computer. I'm sure it was unintentional but as a former manager it was always my policy to ask people with the flu to stay home as part of service to customers. Because of the flu and under-cooked eggs I unfortunately spent a number of days being ill during our stay and afterwards. Yes, it is an extremely pricey hotel. But despite the cost and the occasional imperfection, I would highly recommend the Hotel Danieli. Experiencing Venice would be unimaginably different without calling the Danieli home while there. If you are going to Venice and really would like to experience the true beauty and wonder of it, you must stay at the Danieli. Of course it is in the perfect location next to St. Marco's square and a water taxi/bus can be easily acquired for a day trip to any locale, including the beaches of Lido.

My husband and I spent several days there in August 2011 and were very disappointed. We have traveled all over the world and stayed at wonderful, as well as mediocre hotels and The Danieli certainly did not meet our expectations of a great hotel. The staff is arrogant, the concierge shares the barest minimum of information and our room looked as old as it was, with chips in middle of the doors and scratched, torn wallpaper. The place needs an all around upgrade. We also had to wait in a long line to check in. When we checked in, we were coming off a cruise ship and there was definitely not enough staff to check everyone in. After checking in, I went to the concierge desk to get maps and information and had to wait a long time all over again, because there was not enough staff there either. After we checked in and our room became ready, a young man took us to our room (in the depths of the hotel--certainly no view, no upgrade, no beauty), and he was very friendly and polite. Since our luggage had not arrived, he told us he would have our bags sent up right away. It took hours. LIterally--hours. We had to ask for them again; I think they forgot about us. My husband and I each had to pay to use the hotel computer to confirm our flights and print our boarding passes. I've never had to pay at any hotel in the world till the Danieli. The high rates we paid for our room didn't earn us the right to print our boarding passes for free? On our last day in Venice, we told the concierge that we wanted to make an appointment to take a free hotel water taxi to Murano. The concierge replied that we shouldn't worry, the taxi leaves every twenty minutes, all day. So we went out to do some touring and returned to take the taxi at 3:00 pm. At that point, the concierge said it was too late and the taxis weren't going to Murano any more. Why didn't he tell us that in the morning? We would have changed our plans. When it was time to leave for the airport, the hotel was prepared to get us a water taxi for 120 euro. Right outside the hotel, if you got your own taxi, it cost 110 euro. And of course, the concierge wouldn't tell you this, but very close to the hotel there is a public transportation boat stop where you can get a boat to the airport for 15 euro!

Charming, luxurious, maddening, inefficient, breathtaking, difficult to really know, faded, preposterously beautiful, and unique. We weren't thrilled with the line we had to wait on to check in, but were then charmed by the warmth and the care with which the master of the front desk, Giorgio, explained the hotel and accompanied us up to our room to welcome us to the Danieli (of course, this meant that the wait at the check-in line was extended by 10 minutes for those waiting, but this is, after all, Venice). The room we had, which was by no means a standard room but did not face the canal, at first seemed large but a bit less-than-elegant, but it grew on us over the course of a three-night stay as the brocaded drapes and high ceilings and old but efficient bathroom, the views over some rooftops and the typically amusing Venice chimneys, and the magnificent light joined by music that seemed to come from various rooms and locations in the surrounding neighborhood all conjoined to give us that special sense that Venice washes over you if you allow it. The three best things about The Danieli are its perfect location, next to the Doges Palace along the Grand Canal; the magnificent and historically significant lobby; and a dining terrace at the roof that made morning breakfasts watching over the canal and the islands across the way literally unforgettable. In the end, if you love Venice you will love the Danieli.

The biggest thing you need to be aware of is the upcharge for everything. Be sure breakfast is included...the continental breakfast is 40 Euros per person. And they won't give you an iron (Italy is very tough on this) so our bill was 80 Euros for a few slacks and shirts (this is no joke). The restaurant is expensive too and while the view is stunning they cheese it up with this woman who sings bad pop songs...it would be better quiet. The front desk staff and male manager were not friendly at all and when we challenged the outrageous ironing bill the manager was a tyrant. We heard him with other guests too and he was at least consistently abusive to everyone including his staff who clammed up around him (we felt badly they had to work for him). We finally got a partial credit for the ironing because we wanted pressed clothes so we could eat dinner in their restaurant. He seemed to accept that reasoning...not that his rates are out of control. The other bummer is that it's so close to the square that it's just a mob scene all the time.

We had booked and paid for a room with a king-sized bed and were given a room with two single beds. When I complained, they just pushed the two single together which was not as good as a king-sized bed. I didn't know how to log-in to the Internet using the hotel WI-FI network and after another long wait in the Reception queue to get help I discovered they didn't know either and they referred me to the Concierge desk who also didn't know and they contacted the hotel electrician who was finally able to help. Shortly after moving into our room a plumber arrived to work on the WC which must have been causing problems with the previous occupants. We soon discovered the problem ourselves as the WC didn't always flush. I couldn't face a third long wait in the Reception queue and I managed to keep it going myself during our stay.

We booked the Danieli as part of our Ruby Wedding celebrations. The plan was to stay at the Danieli in a junior suite for 3 nights, travel to Lake Garda and stay at the Grand Hotel, Gardone (see seperate report) for three nights and then return to the Danieli for an overnight stay in a \"basic\" room for one night before returning to Scotland. So this report deals with the two stays at the Danieli. We arrived by water taxi and were treated with great courtesy and efficiency by the staff. Our junior suite room (room 8) was very oppulent and overlooked the Eastern end of the Grand Canal where it opens out into the lagoon. The windows were single glazed and shuttered so did not provide effective sound insulation against the noise of the promenade nor the Vaporeti station. Most Italian hotels when confronted with a noise problem deploy a double window arrangement with different thicknesses of glass. The room was spacious with a separate dressing area. Breakfast was on the roof terrace, and as one previous report mentions this must be the best breakfast venue in the world. We took dinner on one night. A two course meal for two without wine cost 230 euros which I thought a tad expensive. On our return, because it was an overnight stay with an early morning departure we had booked a standard room. This was more modestly decorated and was right next door to the prison of the Doge's Palace. Again the room was spacious with a seperate dressing area and a large bathroom. If anything I preferred it to the junior suite (I have a preference for minimalism whilst my wife prefers oppulence). The public spaces in the Danieli are its greatest asset. Just to sit there after a days sightseeing with a glass of wine amongst all this splendour contemplating the history of the place makes it all worthwhile.

I am an SPG Platinum member. And I never spend the time to write reviews as I am really busy. I'm doing a review for the 1st time because the Danelli was an amazing experience. I had booked my 1st night at the Gritti Palace, and was going to decide where to spend my 2nd night (great thing about the low season). I had originally planned to stay a 2nd night in Gritti Palace as I didn't enjoy the hassle of moving hotels. When I visited the Danelli, my partner and I felt that we liked the ambience, energy of the hotel more. The Gritti Palace was more serious and located in a good and more quiet part of town. But the atmosphere was more sombre and serious, the staff were formal and serious. At the Danelli, the staff felt more approachable, higher energy levels, and the boardwalk was packed with people (i.e. downside is that sea facing rooms with Balcony tend to be a bit noisy in the afternoon till 9pm). Ennoi, at the Front Desk, was amazing. He was kind enough to show me a room with balcony and seaview (thanks for the SPG Platinum upgrade). We loved it and booked the room for our 2nd night in Venice. When we checked in the next day, I was surprised to find a bottle of Prosecco and Cake to celebrate my birthday. I later found out that my partner had spoken to him to arrange it, but he had already done it before she had asked. His care and concern was exemplary among all the thousands of hotel nights that I have spent as a frequent traveller. There were many other examples of his great service that I will not document here. Alessandro at the ground floor lobby bar is another amazing mixologist. He is friendly, knowledgeable, and makes the most amazing drinks. Many people tend to ask for the traditional favourites, but I had asked him to make me some of his favourite cocktails including his own special cocktails. He created traditional as well as special cocktails of his own receipies. I must have had 10-12 cocktails over a 36 hour period with him. it was a really lovely and enjoyable experience to find someone so passionate and knowledgeable about his job. He also gave us ideas on dining spots. He had worked the late shift the day before I had checked out, but he came to say good bye to me at 7:55am the next morning because he knew that my water taxi was coming at 8am. What can I say, is this not amazing personalised service from a hotel with 200+ rooms. Before I arrived in Venice, I had heard that food would be expensive and not great (i.e. for the price of fine dining). The concierge suggested the usual suspects of the top few restaurants in Venice. But I found a little gem of a restaurant where the Venetians tend to go -- great food (especially by Venice standards) at reasonable prices made by a passionate owner/ chef. My Gondola guy had recommended it for good pastas and told me that the Gondaliers go there for meals. Alessandro had also mentioned it had a reputation for great meat dishes. The Assassini, just a minute away from the Opera House, and the restaurant changes their menu daily (e.g. Monday is a study of white meats, another day for stewed meats, and Fridays for a study on seafood). The owner is amazingly friendly, speaks perfect English, and has an Italian only menu (last page with a simple Italian to English/ Russian dictionary for common italian food terms), but the wait staff are friendly and speak English. Kinda like eating at a friend's home with great home cooked style comfort foods -- the owner-chef selects the best of the local produce. And a friendly atmosphere, the owner-chef actually sat at my table, had a glass of wine, and shared local insider's view of Venice. Overall, I had an amazing Birthday in Venice -- strolling, eating, drinking, making friends with 3 amazing local Venetians who helped me to understand a local person's view of Venice and giving me an opportunity to get a glimpse outside the traditional tourist's point of view. And I loved the Danielli Hotel and Assassini Restaurant.", "Date": "March 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Venice, Italy", "Title": "\u201cAmazing location... very disappointing experience...\u201d", "Author": "ArpadHevizi", "ReviewID": "UR98141529", "Content": "Having spend many vacations in Venice in different amazing hotels - including the beautiful Molino in the past - I was really looking forward for our visit of the Danieli this year...

Considering that this is rated as one of the best hotel in Venice for its service... I expected a very different experience... I hope that the management of the hotel is reading these comments and will use the feedback to re-focus / re-train the staff on 'the meaning of customer service': making the guest feel welcomed... as it is the little things that make a difference - especially in boutique hotel - where you are going for the 'experience'.

Lots of celebrities stay here. Even if you don't see any, you can have a look at the Danieli's guest book and see the autographs of all the glitterati. Do not stay here unless you want comfort, Grand Canal view and convenience (no problem getting your luggage up to your room) AND you don't mind paying a very hefty price. If you are pinching pennies, this is definitely not the place for you. The speedboat from the airport cost about $150 for 4 of us (it's about a \u00c2\u00bd hour trip) and that gives you some indication of the fact that you will be bled dry here. The hotel is right next to Piazza San Marco & the Doge's Palace, and so the location is ideal. It's got a prime location, right on the Grand Canal. Our room looked across a short walkway (where booths/sellers sold masks and trinkets) and there was a steady stream of foot traffic. But the windows are modern, heavy and sealed better than any I've seen anywhere, so with the windows closed it's very, very quiet. I'm a light sleeper, so this feature was key for me. We splurged and got a luxurious Executive Suite with a Grand Canal view, as it was our 20th wedding anniversary. Not cheap. But if you are ok with the splurge, it is worth it for the convenient location. I had read the reviews on TripAdvisor extensively, and it appeared to me that you would only have a brilliant stay here if you book one of the better rooms. I can honestly say our room was fantastic. Large, with a view, a sitting area, gigantic marble bathroom, very comfortable bed. It was great. I don't remember the exact but it was around $2500 a night. I would agree with what another reviewer said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153we weren't unhappy, but we weren't wowed either.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd We stayed in the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153newer hotel\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which is next door to the fancy old hotel (with the impressive antique foyer, stained glass, fancy chandeliers). To get to the newer hotel, you walk through a series of stairways and corridors from the old hotel, it's not far, maybe 2 minutes walk from the front desk. The lobby is several centuries old, and very impressive. But, if you want to see the lobby, and you don't want to pay the hefty rates at the Danieli, you can always just come in and have a look, and they won't charge you anything. If you stay here, be aware that LOTS of tourists come here to have that look, so the lobby has a Disneyland-like feel to it. Service here is nothing special. It's a large-ish hotel and the desk staff are businesslike. If you need help they will help you, but you'll just feel like one of a crowd. In fact, there is usually a line to wait in to check in/check out, etc. We asked them to supply the names of some good restaurants. We were directed to a couple of restaurants that were ok, but total rip-offs, cost a fortune, and we didn't have anything particularly memorable. So that was a bust. Would I stay here again? Hmmm... I don't think so. I would check out some of the smaller, funkier hotels, and stay on a quieter side canal. Tip: go to Cafe Florian for breakfast and order the hot chocolate Oh my. It's around $20 (hey, it's Venice, get used to it), but it is the BEST you'll ever had. Like they melted the best bar of Belgian chocolate, and added hot milk. I've tried in vain to make it at home, no dice. It's quite simply the best hot chocolate in the world. But note that they do not open until 10 or 11am, so don't go there too early in the day. Breakfast on the roof, with lovely views over the Grand Canal. Nice but a little pretentious (as is everything in Venice). The good: luxurious, quiet room if you are willing the pay big bucks. Best location on the Grand Canal. Glorious ancient lobby, dripping with opulence. The water taxi brings you right to the back door, so no schlepping luggage around back alleys. Excellent soundproof windows. The bad: antiseptic & overwhelmed hotel staff, massive crowds, the hotel (as well as the town) have a Disneyland-like feel to them.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cExcellent first-class hotel\u201d", "Author": "LondonFamily4", "ReviewID": "UR85778522", "Content": "We have just returned from a short stay in the Hotel Danieli.

The front desk staff were very courteous and helpful. Our room which was large and bright had a superking bed and overlooked the Grand Canal. A buffet breakfast with extensive choice is served in the restaurant which has fabulous views. I loved the fact we were next to St Mark's Square, the water taxis and shops, restaurants and bars. The Osteria da Baco on Calle de la Rasse 4621 close to the hotel is a quaint little bar/coffee shop where one can watch the world go by and watch some of the local characters. We took the speedboat from the airport which cost 25Euros each, the other passengers paid a lot less by booking in advance. Also it dropped us off at the public transport stop instead of the private entrance of The Danieli Hotel. On our return we took public transport and paid Euros 13pp for the hour long journey. This leaves every half hour. A complimentary water taxi leaves from The Danieli Hotel to Murano every 20mins. We had a tour of the glass factory which was interesting and then wandered around the shops. Many of the churches have recitals/concerts. We went to Vivaldis Quattro Stagioni which cost Euros 25 pp and was money well spent. This was a perfect time of year to visit Venice as it wasn't too busy.

There was something unique travelling by boat to a hotel. This was our first stay in Venice and we did not really know what to expect. Unlike other hotels the water taxi actually drives right next to the hotel entrance in a private canal. I had mixed feelings about the decoration of the hotel and at first I didn't really like it.. The room We were shown to a newly renovated room. The new room was rather small but very \"luxury collection\" in decor. Alas no canal view so we decided to upgrade. The new room was in another building. The decoration is dated (as you can see from the photos) however the room is very spacious and the view was just fantastic. What I don't understand is why house-keeping keep closing the curtains / volets every time? :) The view Spectacular view of the Gran Canal. The breakfast Breakfast was not included and at 52\u00e2\u201a\u00ac / person we opted out. Overall The Danieli is a 13-14th Century building. Yes, it feels a bit peculiar in places with the squealing staircases and slow lift - but it's a proper classical building not a custom-built 21st Century hotel, right?

We had a fabulous time in Venice which is more beautiful and fascinating than I ever imagined. On the plus side at the Danieli ............................ -The terrace has to be mentioned first, possibly the finest view in the whole of Venice and having breakfast on a sunny morning and watching the 'theatre show 'that is Venice happening below is sublime. Breakfast was delicious, it is efficiently run with pleasant service. -It is very centrally located, right by St Marks Square and the Doges Palace. There are Vaporetti stops right outside the hotel and it is easy to go any where you want. On your first morning take either the no. 1 (slow and stops at every stop) or no. 2 and travel down the Grand Canal to take in the sights and get your bearings. -Our room was spacious and well planned and the bathroom was immaculate. We had a side and roof top view of the Doges Palace (unfortunately under cover at the moment!). Our was in the newer section of the hotel, I understand that some of the side view rooms in the oldest part of the hotel are very dark. -Bed was exceptional! -Soundproofing in the hotel is excellent The negatives................................ -f you don't like crowds it may not be the hotel for you. When you step out of the hotel doors it is like stepping into Oxford Street on a Saturday, this is due to its close proximity to St Mark's Square and the palace - everyone in Venice wants to visit! -Everything is extra even the TV! -Some staff, and particularly the concierge are not polite and attentive. Some ignore you whilst they talk among themselves at the desk, do not acknowledge you when they take your keys and seem to find it hard to look you in the eye. -Check in and check out can be a long process. -It can be impossible to get hold of guest services on the telephone. I have never experienced such a thing at a hotel before. When you finally do they say they will ring you back and don't. We wasted so much time trying to get codes for wireless network every day and tracing our missing complimentary water. -At 450 euros per night I did not feel the hotel was value for money and unfortunately this is mainly because of our experience with concierge and guest services. To conclude, I would not stay in the Danieli again and the main reason for this is the poor standard of service. Many of the staff downstairs seem weary of tourists and I think they need to take more of an interest in the individuals they are dealing with. It is also worth considering that whilst in Venice for a long weekend you tend to pack your days (well we did!), there is so much to see and we hardly spent any time in the room. Couple of tips, Think twice on the Gondelas, and shop around! If you want a water taxi from the airport consider booking it a couple of days before you go and check the weather before hand! Many people we spoke to had arrived in the rain (we were lucky). Believe me, you see very little if it is pouring and may as well save the money and get the water bus link (check they stop near your hotel)! If it is sunny it is a wonderful way to arrive! I booked ours direct through www.venicelink.com and I think it was reasonably priced compared to what others had paid. Also if your suitcase is heavy get a trolley from the airport! 1 Euro deposit - it is a 7 minute walk from the airport to the water taxis (seems longer) and that is tough on shoulders when you are dragging an over weight suitcase. The Vaporetti are a wonderful mode of transport and great way to see Venice - buy passes and stay on them for as long as you like!", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Sydney, Australia", "Title": "\u201cIndulge yourself just once\u201d", "Author": "Mariner59", "ReviewID": "UR80576503", "Content": "Taking a water taxi from the airport to the Danieli (Euro100 and very easy) is one of life's great experiences, being ferried directly to the landing of the hotel and met by the Concierge.

In general, I wouldn't go back to Venice, least of all in summer; a crowded sweaty decaying city, much less stay here. Be warned about the A/C. Anemic corner units. You will sweat a lot. The bathrooms have no windows and no ventilation, if you shower your room will steam up for hours. ANd the plumbing is funky-hot water comes out of both taps at the sink, you have to wait a few mins for the cold water to come out. I was in 2 different rooms on different floors. I didn't bother reporting because when you call any dept on the phone it rings 25 times so I just gave up. Only room service was attentive to deliver a bucket of ice so I could cool down at night. It was uncomfortably hot and they didn't do a thing about it--too bad dumb turista! Don't bother with a room with a view of the grand canal, the noise will be awful outside of your window. The back rooms are quiet and dark, perfect for sleeping and resting from the tornado of tourists outside your door.

This hotel began in the 14th century as Palazzo Dandolo and has been wonderfully preserved and restored. We stayed at the Danieli the last week of June and could not have had a more wonderful experience. Arriving from Marco Polo airport via water taxi we were escorted through their canal side entrance into the most wonderful and ornate lobby I have ever seen. The check-in process was quick and professional with a great multi-lingual staff. We were escorted to our rooms by one of the front desk professionals and our luggage arrived promptly. The rooms were decently sized for Venice and were absolutely gorgeous. The walls were fabric covered, drapes thick and plush, furniture authentic feeling antiques, beds large and comfortable, and the bathroom was marble clad and was beautiful. We tripped a breaker with one of our American electronic devices and engineering was at the room within 5 minutes to get us back running. The turndown service was very nice with some incredible chocolates left on the pillow. The rooms were very well sound proofed as we were above a small street that had parades of World Cup revelers after each goal scored and we never heard them except when we opened the windows. The location on St. Mark's Basin next door to the Bridge of Sighs and around the corner from St. Mark's Square is the absolutely ideal spot for a home base in Venice. There were a couple of negatives that need to be reported. The air conditioning in one of our rooms never could get the room completely cool. As we didn't report this to management I can't complain too much about this. The elevators are very small and very slow. The breakfast buffet at the rooftop restaurant was 100% unchanged for the three days we were there. A superior restaurant with the outstanding chef they have could probably be a little creative and give patrons a little variety (Other than that, the Terrazza is a don't miss experience in Venice, especially at night....Oh, the view!!!!!). Finally, I was most disappointed with the concierge. Other than helping us with a Murano Glass factory tour, they were useless. They would not help with tour reservations, they were little help with restaurant recommendations, and they gave incorrect information to us on at least two occasions.

If you like old world charm and antique furniture and fittings then pick this hotel. The room was surprisingly large, plenty of storage and the bathroom again was very large in comparison to modern hotels. We had booked a Deluxe room, we were offered on arrival a room at the front of the hotel for an extra charge, to which we declined, and pleased we did as the room we had was on the small canal side and very peaceful, I can only imagine that although we would have had excellent views of the grand canal, it would have been noisy as it was very busy at the waterfront. I know some people have said they were disappointed with the furniture and fittings etc, but bearing in mind the age of the building and the history that goes with it what did they expect? It is in an excellent location, we looked at the Cipriani before we booked and glad we chose the Danieli for location it couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be beat. If you stay at the Cipriani you need to rely on water taxis to get you over to the main island. Right outside the hotel are the gondolas, and the public transport Vaporetto water bus stops. The concierges are excellent, very welcoming always a good morning and a good evening, if you smile and speak to them they speak back!! The staff at breakfast have to put up with some very rude customers, which we regularly observed, but always dealt with them with a smile, we have no complaints there, we were always met with a pleasant good morning and shown to our table. Breakfast is expensive if you are not booked on a B & B basis and have to add it to your bill, so I would recommend booking in advance. The view is worth it though, we were lucky in that we had bright sunny mornings to enjoy breakfast on the terrace. We were on an American breakfast plan, this meant we had a full choice from the buffet. Fresh tea and coffee brought to the table by waiters, then help yourself to the juice, water, champagne\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6and as much as you can eat, from fruit and cereals to a full cooked breakfast. We ate heartily before venturing out as you need a lot of stamina to get around Venice. We never saw the maid, but she was like a secret fairy. Each time we left our room, we would return to find clean towels and beds made, on one occasion we must have had 3 sets of towels in one day, and on an evening the bed was turned down and chocolates left. They could do with getting the air conditioning improved, even the receptionist who showed us to our room complained it was too hot and flung open the windows and shutters to let the air in. It was very warm on an evening, we closed the shutters for privacy but left the windows open but there was very little air coming in. We were on the second floor in the original building, overlooking the side canal, and over the rooftops. Each afternoon, when we went back to our room for a rest, we could hear the gondoliers serenading their guests, amazingly it was always Japanese tourists, maybe they are the only ones who can afford it? The hotel has its own boat dock which was excellent, we had pre-booked a shared water taxi through a website \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcViator\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 it was the most reasonable on costs. They took us right up to the dock and picked us up from the dock 4 days later, right on schedule. We used the hotel internet it was \u00e2\u201a\u00ac5 for 15 minutes, which is average for most places, it gave us ample time to check in for our return flight home, it is also attached to a printer so we could print off our boarding cards saving time at the airport. The internet room is a very dark library room, but very calm and peaceful next to reception. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on the caf\u00c3\u00a9 bar area, mainly as we wanted to experience Venice we ate and drank outside.

Our standard rooms were spacious and lovely although the bathrooms were small, cramped and rather run-down - not at all consistent with the opulence of the hotel in general. Service was extremely substandard overall - we found the public bathrooms without toilet paper; maids did not remove empty glasses and cups from our room when doing the turn-down service; and a bedside lamp with a nonworking bulb which I removed in order to demonstrate that it needed to be replaced, remained untouched. Not what you would expect from a 5* hotel, and certainly not consistent with the prices. Our rate was room only and the buffet breakfast cost a staggering 50 euros per person; the continental breakfast which consisted of a glass of juice, a hot drink and a very ordinary basket of pastries cost 32 euros per person. With 4 of us, this represented a significant additional cost. With a glass of wine costing 15 euros each, a couple of drinks each in the lobby in the evening was also highway robbery (that's if anyone even bothered to come near us to to see if we wanted anything). On the other hand, we found the concierges to be extremely helpful - they made several restaurant recommendations, all of which were excellent and exactly in the price range we had specified. If you are interested in visiting Murano, I would urge you to take the public bus there rather than the (ostensibly) free Danieli launch. This delivered us to a showroom where we were welcomed and shown some glassblowers at work. We were then escorted around a huge showroom full of stunning pieces and subjected to a very \"hard-sell\". When we enquired as to whether there were other glass workshops on the island we could visit we were told that there was no point, and that we might as well go back to Venice. We later learned from friends who had travelled out on the public vaporetto that there were numerous glass showrooms; they had wandered around the island and even visited a little church there. Finally, another consideration may be that, while the location of the Danieli appears enviable - just steps from the Doges' Palace and St Marks' Square - at peak times the scene just outside the front door resembles Oxford St at rush hour. In the future, I would definitely opt for a quieter location.

With a small cup of hot chocolate priced at \u00c2\u00a38, sadly its not possible to spend any time in the luxurious surroundings of the hotel. We had to spend our time between exploring and going out for dinner, in the bedroom. As there were no drink making facilities the only thing I could afford to do was relax in the luxrious bath. Overall the hotel is well worth visiting and a real pleasure to stay at. Even the cheapest rooms are big enough and stylish with a very comfortable bed. Don't be fooled when they try and get you to upgrade for double the money - not worth it as rooms are not much bigger. Hotel restaurant was disppointing for the money - really dated and the food was not 5 star - especially with main courses at \u00c2\u00a350!

We enjoyed so many things about our room: the starched linen sheets, the gorgeous Murano glass chandelier, the entirely marble bath, beautiful parquet wood floors, and the cleanliness. This hotel used to be the palace of Doge Dondalo and it shows in the hotel lobby and stunning marble staircases. We attended a dinner in the Marco Polo room in the adjoining building, which is also part of the Danieli, and we loved the scent of leather and fine wood in that section of the hotel. The hotel's rooftop terrace restaurant is its crowning jewel. We looked forward to lingering over breakfast there each morning, enjoying the view of the St. Mark's Basin and other islands, as well as the cool breeze. The staff was charming and attentive.

The location was great and had easy access to the Airport Vaporetto (stopped literally in front of the hotel to the left). My only issue with the Danieli was the staff, I found them to be quite snobby especially the waiter in the lobby bar. Upon arrival we were told our room was not ready and to have a seat in the bar while we waited and so we only ordered drinks & a few snacks since it was an off hour and we wanted to hold out until we got into our room, showered and went out to eat. The waiter at the bar treated us like we were some poor degenerates and was down right rude that we were only ordering light fare (salads, cheeses & paninis) and went as far as sighing while we were ordering. I've travelled to many places around the world and stayed at many types of properties and no matter how upscale this hotel is - a rude sighing waiter is just not acceptable anywhere especially at the Danieli with the prices that guests are paying for their rooms. I absolutely loved the hotel itself and the front desk staff but the bar & conceirge desk were just plain rude, next time - I'll probably stay at the Westin or the Gritti Palace down the canal.

Black & white marble floors, shower/tub combo with gauzy white curtains, double vanity with nice sundries, a fabulous scale, and lots of plush white bath linens, all refreshed during turndown service. Nice view into a little canal out the window \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can actually see gondoliers going past if you open the shutter. A thick, plushy robe was hanging up for each of us, and slippers were waiting under a little chair. Turndown service: In the evenings when we had returned from our day\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s outings, the room would be turned down for the night. Duvet folded back, pillows arranged, nice chocolates on the end tables, little mats on each side of the bed with our slippers laid out on them, all sundries and bath linens refreshed, the shutters and windows closed and the curtains drawn. We tend to keep things pretty tidy, but it seemed like they had straightened our things up a bit too. The building: It is a Venetian masterpiece and landmark (marble, gilding, gothic windows, Murano chandeliers, etc.) and has the history of being a former Doge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s palace. The hotel is actually a few adjacent buildings connected through the interiors by beautiful and straightforward hallways and stairways. I think there may be service elevators, but they are not for general use and anyone who can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do stairs might better check with them about accessibility. Of course as soon as you arrive in front of the hotel, porters whisk out to collect your things from you and then they magically reappear in your room. The location: Hotel Danieli has its own Vaporetto (water bus) stop right out front that was very easy for us to use, and we speak no Italian except \u00e2\u20ac\u0153please\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153thank you.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (***On a trip a few years earlier, my rural-dwelling parents found the water bus much more tricky. It could be that my husband and I are accustomed to using the subway system around our own town, making it easier for us to pick this system up.) It will take you up and down the main artery of Venice and the stops are clearly marked. Leaving the hotel, turn right and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a two minute walk from St. Mark\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s square. Turn left and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re headed toward restaurants and other things around town. Postcard view wherever you look, and there are tons of kiosk vendors on the walkway out front for the usual kinds of inexpensive souvenirs (Pinocchio puppets, carnival masks, t-shirts, umbrellas, etc.). There were plenty of places to wander close by \u00e2\u20ac\u201c restaurants, exquisite shops, places to get coffee or gelato, etc. The concierge: These guys were very helpful and courteous. They seemed to recommend very tourist-oriented places (large enough to hand out postcards, etc. to the hotels). For our own preference, we had to explain to them that we preferred something off the pizza-and-pasta route (there are some marvelous ones available, but we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really want it for more than a lunch now & then) and they were a bit baffled that tourists might want something a bit more gourmet. They also have pretty good maps and will draw directions to whatever you might want to visit on them for you. We found the city easy enough to navigate that we picked what we wanted from our guidebook and then just went around on our own. ***Also, this is a different area of staffing, but when you order a wake-up call \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a real person! It was very charming \u00e2\u20ac\u201c they say buon giorno to you and tell you the time and current weather, wish you a good day, and hang up when you give them an indication that you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got the message. The food: After some serious touring, we were pretty tired on our last night and decided to cancel our dinner reservations and just stay in and order room service. Everything turned out to be delicious, so we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel like we were missing out cuisine-wise at all! Everything was delivered about 45 minutes after we ordered it. The kitchen staff spoke perfect English (as did every other member of the staff we interacted with), so ordering was very easy for us. Everything was wheeled in by porters (who discreetly did not notice that we were in our bathrobes). They swiftly set it all up and then told us to call when we wanted them to take it away. Tablecloth, candle, flowers, wine, and bread basket accompanied our various courses which were all covered with silver dome covers, except for the salad of course, which they has assembled in-room during the setup so that it would be fresh and crisp. Plenty to make me (the vegetarian in our family) happy. The Danieli has a full-service restaurant and also a breakfast buffet, but we ate all of our other meals out and about so can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t comment on them. It was a spectacular stay and if we were ever to travel back ourselves or recommend to anyone looking for a special place to stay, we would stay again or suggest it to others without hesitation.", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "Title": "\u201cone of the best hotels in the world.\u201d", "Author": "meron1", "ReviewID": "UR17307775", "Content": "Hotel Danieli is one of my favorite hotels in Italy. we stayed at the Danieli for the weekend in mid summer of 2005.

On the plus side - the location is unbeatable, right on the water by St. Mark's Square. The public rooms are very grand. There is a private water taxi stop, and the terrace has the best view in the city. Luxury touches in the room were welcome - linen towels and sheets, lovely housekeeping, lots of closet storage, a minibar and functioning AC (very appreciated in the heat.) In the bathroom, we had lovely robes, a nice scale and a bidet. (Oh fun.) We were given a very large room in the original wing, which was also very nice. On the downside - the room was dark with little natural light and rather depressing. The furnishings and decor in our room were surprisingly shabby, drab and depressing for such an expensive and lauded hotel (posted rack rate was over $2000/night). Picky though it seems, the painting of the walls/paneling was really amateurish and sloppy, and looked really tacky. I would fire someone who painted my woodwork like that! The shower curtain was worse than a Motel 6 (not to disparage Motel 6) flimsy and unweighted. Every time I showered, it billowed inwards, sticking to my body. I would cower against the wall and hold it away from my body with one hand whilst scrubbing with the other. Sheesh! Noise traveled easily between the rooms, and we were awakened several times by heavy dragging noises overhead and/or in the hallway. As mentioned previously, no irons or coffee or tea in the room., and ordering room service cost an arm and a leg. And did I mention the food prices? OMG! We went on to the terrace for a drink one afternoon. The view was stupendous. But my cocktail was 24E (over $35) and my husband's beer was over $20. This was ridiculous even for Venice. Lastly, the staff were a strange mix of very kind, helpful people (especially housekeeping, maintenance, porters) and despairingly condescending (concierge! and front desk.) I can't paint everyone with the same brush - there were some front desk and concierge staff that were very friendly and kind. But one or two bad apples really spoiled the whole bunch.

I agree with all of the critical comments listed here. The big pluses: the location is most impressive, right on the main canal, in the center of all the activity in Venice, and right next to the huge shopping area. Other pluses: it's immensely old, like living in an antique, a very interesting place. And the restaurant on the roof terrace offers an unparalleled view of Venice, really magnificent. Now the problems. First was the staff. A mixed situation. Some of the staff are very friendly, helpful, and professional. Too many of the others are haughty, arrogant, obnoxious, and downright snotty. Several times I felt like ripping someone's face off. I do not wish to stay in such an expensive place and be insulted by uneducated workers who fancy themselves licensed to act condescendingly simply because they work there. The air conditioning in the hotel is completely inadequate. The weather in Venice when we were there was cool and the air conditioning was barely adequate. There is no question that this hotel would be unacceptably hot in warm weather. Also due to the canals surrounding thehotel being used as sewers, inside the lobby and other parts of the hotel, on numerous occasions, you could actually smell sewage. I was told that when the water level rises dangerously high, some kind of alarm goes off, and the staff removes all the furnishings from the lobby floor and takes itsomewhere else, then the lobby floods with sewer water, then when it recedes they sterilize it and replace the furnishings. I don't know how true this is but from having stayed on the premises it seems plausible to me. Our room was average size, and had a huge, lovely, all-marble bathroom and a very high ceiling, which I like. The furnishings in the rest of the room were well worn, even shabby, not at all in keeping with five-star hotel status. The air conditioner in the room was weak and noisy, clattering constantly, with bent vanes in the duct. I was so glad the weather was cool, otherwise the room would have been much too warm. The lamps were nice and bright, unlike those in many other hotels that are dim in an effort to control electricity costs (at the expense of dark and depressing rooms), but one of the bulbs was out when we arrived and was never replaced despite numerous cleaning staff visits. The service is also spotty. To my surprise I discovered that due to \"fire regulations\" (??) they do not provide or allow an iron and ironing board in the rooms, so if your nice clothing was wrinkled during travel and need it needs to be tironed you must ask the staff of the hotel to do it for you (for an outrageous price). I did this, and they never showed up. I called again to the concierge late in the afternoon, who seemed puzzled that it hadn't been done, and then I found that the place where the ironing is done was closed for the night and I would have to wait until morning. This left me with no appealing option for dressing for an evening out. I was not happy with this at all. The windows of our room were shuttered from the outside, allowing no natural light to enter. The room cleaning staff were friendly, helpful, and hard working. So what we have is a very mixed situation.

Was prepared by other's who have written here about the rooms, but wish more could be done to improve the fate of this historic property. It is listed by the Starwood group as\"Luxury Collection.\" As mentioned the hotel is very grand(once you enter) and lobby/lounge beautifully maintained. There may be rooms here that are more delux than what we were offered, but I imagine there are a fair amount of rooms which were like mine, in need of TLC(tender loving care) or updating. The bathroom looked as if it were \"repaired,\" but not with quality in mind. There were old plastered walls with cracks, worn rug and beds, not \"heavenly\". We made the best of our stay and tried not to focus on the room. Just felt need to mentioned so you know what to expect. We were there during Venice film festival, so it was very crowded. Liked the location though since close to St. Marks Square and to Public ferry stop. We purchased a 36hrs pass and used it to venture to different areas including the Island of Murano which was a very nice way to spend some time, away from the crowds. At night you can walk to the square for live bands that play to appreciative crowds. Many restaurants in the area. Can just walk around, read menus, and choose one that looks good. Not a big seafood lover, so had to find ones that had meats, poultry, pasta, etc. My daughter is big on Chicken, which was hard to find throughout our travels. As an added bonus, we saw Colin Farrell having a drink in our lobby and Paul Simon walking with family in St. Marks Square. We wanted to take their complimentary shuttle to sister properties on Lido , but told very crowded and pools were closed. Depending on time of year, this would be a nice diversion. The hotel offered us a 20Euro per person breakfast buffet instead of the usual 50Euros. We took advantage of this offer and enjoyed the breakfasts on the rooftop with great views. Really nice way to start your day.

So beware scams are waiting!!!! In my opinion the hotel was great in ever aspect except the Danieli being clear on this relationship with the Hotel des Bains and the Excelsior on Lido also the private launch system. I had called the hotel from the airport and told them I was checking in that afternoon and ask what was the best way to get to the hotel and they said a water taxi for 90 euro or about $125.00. They did not offer a Danieli complimentary shuttle from the Airport?? Upon check in \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we were not briefed on the Danieli private launch system or (so called private launch system) or the extended link between other hotels. This would have been very good information to have prior to arriving \u00e2\u20ac\u201c or being briefed by the check in clerk. All that being said, we used the concierges on our second day when we said we were going to Island of Moreno where the glass is blown and he said he would book a private launch to take us there compliments of the hotel. I thought nice touch and first class then the scam began. So we book this so-called private complimentary launch to the island when we get there and a woman is waiting at the dock. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re landing at the back of a building not at a tourist type drop off area \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no problem I tip the boat driver and we disembark. She walks us into a glass blowing workshop where there is other tourist sitting around watching men blow glass. We sit down and she starts to explain the process as the one old guy starts to make a small glass horse as she is explaining the details of glass blowing. Then I see a tip jar on the counter \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no problem, I tip the old guy when he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s done \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still no problem. So now here comes the SCAM and sales pitch \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not hard-core as far as I was concerned, but my wife felt uncomfortable and that was enough to prompt me to write this email. She felt scammed and it is a scam so beware of this. A free shuttle is a free shuttle and should not come with strings. This was very disappointing to say the least is a big black eye on the Danieli as far as we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re concerned. We spent about an hour being led from one room to another every room was the sales pitch. We finally ask so where is the exit to the rest of the island was and left to building. So after this we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t ask or talk to the concierges for anything else except to hand over or receiving our room key when leaving or entering the hotel. We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to be sucked into some other scam where someone is getting kick back based on if we bought a 5,000 Euro piece of art. Give me break \u00e2\u20ac\u201c so what does this guy think I was born yesterday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c if I can afford to stay at the Danieli I might just be wise enough to see a scam coming. Other stuff: The Bar; 10 Euro per glass of wine or about $14.00 US. Hotel coffee for 7 Euro per cup in the room, so go out the main door of the lobby make a right and right go about 200 feet on the right hand side a small shop \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll see the water taxi guy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and other locals there getting their morning goods \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Coffee standing at the counter 1 Euro and it was excellent we found this place on day 3. Transportation - after the scam \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we used only the waterbus system - white beat up boats with a lot of people on board you can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss them they only go one way and you can set your watch by them. They are very easy to figure out and fun. In most cases we were re never ask for a ticket there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s too many people and if they do ask you for a ticket you can buy one on the boat. You do have to buy 12 Euro ticket per person to go to and from the airport this is a different company \u00e2\u20ac\u201c yellow boats and they don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t run as often.

In general, we found that European standards are much lower than N. American standards in terms of 5-star ratings.

The Platinum Concierge and the Hotel Concierge were both reliably polite, informative and extremely helpful. We arrived in Venice and disembarked a very nice Princess Cruise through the Mediterranean that started in Rome. The hotel arranged for a private hosted water taxi from the ship to the hotel for about $140 Euro for my family of 4 (2 young kids) and all our luggage. This proved to be some of the best money I have ever spent! The hostess met us at the ship terminal with a sign with our name on it. We were then ushered with our luggage past the thousands of people desperately looking for transportation, to our own private water taxi. Porters handled the luggage, and we then stretched out in the spacious taxi to enjoy a beautiful view of Venice as we approached the Danieli Hotel. We were driven to a private dock attached directly to the Danieli, and porters arrived to fetch our luggage. The entrance to the hotel (a converted palace) was, well....palatial! The decor was breathtaking, and it made the wait to check in tolerable. The lounge in the hotel entrance was sumptuously appointed and very comfortable. The prices were insane ($20 Euro for a bottle of water), but I got a few bottle of water outside the hotel entrance for $2 Euro, and the bartenders had no issue with that (I personally think that they also thought that the prices were excessive). We could not check in until 4pm, and so we left our luggage to enjoy the beauty of Venice, which was easy, because was were only 1 block away from St. Mark's Square and the amazing shops, restaurants and piazzas that surrounded it. Before we knew it, 4:00 happened, and we returned to our hotel with arms full. We were shown to our rooms, which were breathtaking, sumptuously appointed, and suprisingly large. For about $500 Euro per night per room, we had two connecting rooms. Law prohibits the booking of more than 2 people per room, and we could have easily have had our kids in our room - but what the heck! The view from the room was a canal view, and definitely worth the price. The \"Venetian Blinds\" were amazing, and I intend to purchase these blinds (that are electronically controlled from the bed tables) for my house! The bathrooms were large, beautifully appointed in natural marble, with towel heaters, etc. The concierge was pleased to send porters with ice buckets to keep our drinks cold, and the hotel provided complimentary bottles of water in each fridge in the rooms. The sheets at the hotel were absolutely amazing, with at least an 800 thread count. The beds were amazingly comfortable, and very large king sized beds. The hotel Concierge was very helpful, friendly and professional. He definitely added to the quality of the stay, and I was pleased to tip him appropriately at the end of our three day stay in Venice. At the end of our stay, the Concierge got us a hostessed private water taxi to the airport, and we were again ushered past thousands of people in line, our luggage handled by porters, and we easily boarded our flights with a minimum of fuss. Again the service cost $140 Euro, but was definitely worth it. The whole thing about Venice is that \"you get what you pay for\". If you can't afford to stay in \"the best\" or \"nearly the best\", you probably should expect to have a less wonderful time than those people that post their experiences when they stay in the nicer places. Venice is probably one of the most expensive cities in Europe. We found the city pristine in cleanliness, and there was no bad smell at all, as there is reputed to be. The people of Venice are cautiously friendly, and take to tourists that don't act like (no offense intended) \"stereotypical obnoxious Americans\". A polite \"Buon Giorno\" or \"Buono Serra\" can get you a great deal in terms of investment in communication and service in this beautiful but sometimes quircky city. Prices for meals in Venice vary from reasonable to insane. I paid $45 Euro for a Bellini at Harry's Famous Bar. The Bellini was terrible, but the nostalgia was nice. Women can dress as they like at Harry's, but men must all wear long slacks, or they are not permitted in. Harry's is like a big ongoing joke: definitely not worth the cost of anything they serve, but worth the cost for the nostalgia for some. No matter what kind of direction sense you have in Venice....you will get lost. It is impossible not to. Just enjoy getting lost, and you cannot fail but to look forward to the next time you get to get lost in this city. The Gondola Ride cost about $100 Euro for 4 people in 1 Gondola. Our Gondolier, \"Maximo\" was friendly and informative. The 40 minute trip was great, and our kids loved it. We will definitely go back to Venice, but would not think of staying anywhere but the Danieli, in their nicest rooms! I'll add photos of this hotel shortly......

We found the staff efficient and charming, were escorted to our room overloking the lagoon and gifts of champagne and chocolates were sent to us. As we were late arriving we had room service which was prompt and the food was of a high standard. The room itself was in the manner of the hotel in that it had old furniture but all the facilities worked and there was no sign whatsoever of loose electrical fittings or rustng screws which I had read of from other writers.

The view is magnificent.

The view from any 4* hotel terrace on Via Capo in Sorrento beats the Danieli hands down; the grand canal isn't a patch on a restaurant terrace looking over the pretty town of Sorrento, the deep blue of the Bay of Naples and Mt. Vesuvio in the distance. But, for me, the good bits end there. As a hotel to stay in, it does not justify it's reputation. The location and lobby/bar are what make it a 5* hotel. In every other respect, it's a good 4* We were, it seems, lucky; we had a room that overlooked the side canal. You could end up in the new part which looks, from the outside, like any other chain hotel. However if you're on the side canal, expect to be woken up by the refuse collections at 8am. The narrow space between the buildings magnifies the racket of bottles and the rubbish compactor. The room itself was tatty. It's not a case of 'faded elegance' or 'shabby chique', it's just tatty. The bath itself was too small to get a shower; the shower curtain must have cost less than 10\u00e2\u201a\u00ac. The screws holding the marble tiles were rusty. It probably looked very nice 20 years ago, but no more. The room itself was big enough, and it had a couple of nice antique bits of furniture. The linen on the beds was nice and clean and the beds were comfy. The air-conditioning sort of worked, but it was cooler with the windows open which let the mosquito's in. They'd be better off with ceiling fans. The corridors were dark and dingy; whatever gilted plasterwork and pictures had once lined it were gone, and the walls were painted in several shades of beige. The rugs on the floor slipped when yo stood on them, and the lights on the walls were literally hanging off in a few places. The breakfast, was a disgrace. They supposedly serve until 10.30 but after 10, don't expect there to be anything left. We didn't have to pay for it (it was included), but if they'd asked me for \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50/person per day I'd have refused to pay. One American chap complained that it was no better than a canteen, and he was right. What food there was had been out for a long time, and the self-service area was messy. For \u00e2\u201a\u00ac55 a hea I'd have expected to have ordered breakfast to be cooked fresh and brought to me whilst still hot, not to be picking at the poached eggs to see if thre were any left that hadn't gone hard, or fishing around in the grease to see if there was any bacon that wasn't burnt. Any bacon at all would have been nice one day! It could be argued that we should have complained; if it had been one or two little things I would have. But in a 5* hotel, you shouldn't have to, and when so many things are wrong, it shows that the level of service is bad all round and all the time and you're wasting your breath. I don't goto a 5* hotel to spoil my stay by having to complain. There was a queue for terrace tables, I know there's only so many but they just left people standing in a queue. Italians were guided past the queue to any empty tables, everyone else had to wait their turn. I don't expect to be left standing in a queue in a 5* place, at least they could have offered to get us some coffee or a drink or something. Given that lunch/dinner was going to be no better (and reading the comments here that seems to be true), we didn't waste our money. YOu can find nice places to eat for a fraction of the cost 5 minutes away. The same applies to the bar; we figured from the room minibar that the bar prices would be astronomical, and again you can find nice bars round the corner. Even Harry's bar was cheaper for a bellini than a martini here. Just walk past San Marco and the gardens and vaporetti stops and it's on your right. Minibar prices: \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 for a can of coke, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 for a miniature of chivas regal, \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8 for a small tube of pringles. Room service prices - \u00e2\u201a\u00ac30 for a cheese and ham toastie, and that's the cheapest thing on there!

The front desk and concierge staff were mostly friendly and helpful, and got us tickets to \"Music at the Palazzo\" without holding out their hands. We took advantage of the launch to the Lido to see the other two hotels in the SPG offerings, and of the free launch to Murano (though we ducked out of the offered tour of the glass factory).

(I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll attach a link to our pictures in another post). It was breathtaking and worth every penny hehe. Check in was smooth and we arrived at our hotel room with a complimentary bottle of champagne and truffles since it was our anniversary. We were happy! Our room was an inside room about 30 sq meters, room 221. It was beautifully decorated including a white marble bath. It was the smallest room we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve ever stayed in, but we expected it! I must say the amenities, d\u00c3\u00a9cor and location did make up for the short comings in the room size. We had a great blow dryer (which was a relief since my converter and adapter didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work). They had a towel warmer in the bathroom, slippers, robes (of course) and a vanity stool for me to sit on when getting ready. The TV and stations were actually the best we had for our trip, but that was not saying much at all. There was 3 english channels and cnn was one of them. I guess we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not on vacation to watch TV but its something we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used to in New York. The FIRST night we ate at our hotel the Danieli at the rooftop restaurant with some of the best views of the Grand Canal. My husband Chris enjoyed his risotto immensely but I was disappointed with the John Dory I ordered (which is one of my favorite fishes). The service was great but as advised, some of the best meals in Venice, and in Italy are not at hotels, they are at Osteria\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Trattorias. This is unlike New York and was something valuable I learned on my trip thanks to all here. That evening we had drinks and listened to music at the Danieli Bar. It was incredible! The martini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s were (gasp) 20 euros and higher. But if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re staying there I guess we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not supposed to gasp about the price hehe.

I am so glad I didn't (maybe the poor reviews lowered my expectations and that is why I liked it). This is without a doubt a nicely furnished, luxury hotel. This hotel is what all the other chains (Intercontinental, etc.) aspire to be but fall short. I will admit that there is no way I would spend 600 Euro a night to stay here. (more of a budget thing than a reflection of the hotel.) I used my rewards points to pay for a night at this hotel and it absolutely made my trip to Venice complete. It cost me a lot (for the rewards points used for one night here, I could have had 3 nights at most other hotels). However luxury is worth it. My room was nicely decorated ... there were some spots where the room could have used a little paint, etc. but overall it felt clean and very spacious. In Venice, this is a surprise ... at another hotel chain's hotel in Rome I could have fit 2 of those rooms in my one room at the Danieli. Maybe it was because I was in the main building (the pink one) ... as there are two other buildings (white ones) on each side that the hotel owns ... but I didn't see anything that was glaringly bad about the upkeep or furnishings in the hotel. In fact, even the common areas of the hotel have amazing works of art hanging there. A lot of people complain about how expensive this hotel is (it is true that a meal for one person at the restaurant will cost around 60 - 80 Euros for an entre and drink FOR LUNCH ... the water or soda alone is 9 Euro!!!) however, keep in mind that if the prices were more reasonable the crowds of tourists that make the streets unbearable in Venice would crowd the tables at the rooftop restaurant making it less exclusive. The view from the restaurant is AMAZING! It is a complete panorama of the lagoon. The service is great (a little on the snooty side if you are a younger person) and the food is among the best I had in Venice. They have entrees such as steak to scorpion fish. You really must get at least one meal in on the rooftop restaurant ... I suggest lunch on a nice day. (If you have starwoods points, for 4,500 points they will give you a free lunch if you ask the concierge to arrange it.) The location of the hotel is spectacular. It is right next to the Vaporado (ferry boat/subway boat) and you can use the hotel's shuttle to go to the beach or the other Sheraton properties. You are only a short walk (less than a block) from St. Mark's Square where you can have a drink at night while an orchestra plays. I would highly recommend anyone who has the extra points or money to disregard most of the reviews of this hotel because I am a very picky traveler and honestly, this was one of the best stays I've had in Italy. Although rooms with a Lagoon view are almost impossible to get for under 1000 Euro, the room I had was a standard room and I had a canal view. The Gondolas would pass right under my window and occasionally a Gondola with an accordian would pass by, which made a perfect feeling of Venice. If I stuck my head out the window, I could see the lagoon. Overpriced? Maybe. But if you are looking for luxury and exclusivity, the Danieli is your hotel! I looked at the Gritti Palace and the Weston Europa ... both also owned by Sheraton ... and the Danielli was by far the best overall in its location, charm and restaurants. When you check in, if you want to visit the other restaurants or bars at these hotels, they give you a card which you can charge any meal or drink to your room in the Danieli. A FANTASTIC HOTEL!!!

If you want luxurious accomodations, in the heart of things, don't mind that some areas the wear is showing, then the Danieli IS the hotel in Venice.

I rarely eat meals at the hotels where I stay and it is quite easy to walk two doors down to the Londra Palace and enjoy a nice meal for 35 Euros, breakfast buffet there for 18 Euro. My rate was discounted - even at 385 Euro/night. The room had luxurious bedding, fabric walls that matched the drapers and chairs, a view of the grand canal, an air conditioner that worked quite well and a complimentary bottle of wine. Also, on a very positive note was that the personnel this trip were far from \"snooty\" and were entirely gracious and helpful. Another huge plus is free water taxi service to Murano as well as to the Lido. These trips alone on a private taxi would set you back 200 Euro round trip.

It was my first visit to Venice, which made it especially amazing. I checked in around 11am and my room was not ready but they said it would be ready shortly, so I stepped outside the hotel and was promptly approached to take the free boat ride to Murano. I read about this here and there so I was prepared, and since I love art glass I wanted to go there anyway. I actually loved the semi-private (me and another couple) trip to Murano. We enjoyed the demonstration and toured the incredible display rooms and then we were whisked back to Venice without any problems. It was a very special introduction to the back \"alleys\" and waterways of Venice. I arrived back to the Danieli around 12noon and the room was \"almost\" ready. I kept checking back and in about a 1/2 hour more and a little prodding, I was graciously escorted to my room in the old section. I was on the third floor above the extraordinary lobby. My room was elegant and charming but worn....definitely in need of an update. Maybe a new area rug to cover the bedroom floor would have made all the difference. The linens were luxurious. The bathroom was in the same condition. I was prepared for this after reading all of the reviews pre-trip, so I did not let this ruin my stay at the Danieli. My room was overlooking one of the side canals and my window opened up fully so I could clearly look out and see the gondolas floating 3 floors below.........it was fabulous. The gondoliers songs were echoing up the alley to my room....very charming. This side was very quiet and all I could hear in the morning was the church bells. The location of the hotel was perfect. Breakfast and afternoon tea was included in my package. The outdoor breakfast restaurant was overlooking the main lagoon and it was breathtaking. The breakfast buffet was plentiful and delicious. Afternoon tea in the lobby was also delicious and special. I am looking forward to my next visit to Venice and I would not hesitate to stay here again, however, there are other hotels in Venice that I would like to try next time.

Comprising three distinct structures, it does matter which one has your room, including the 14th century palace, 18th century palace, and a 20th building that also holds the restaurant. In a nutshell, this place is magnficient, but not perfect. I've stayed in some great places and this ranks very near the top. In terms of romantic appeal and history, nothing beats it. Now, the location is both positive, and you guessed it, negative. Right on the lagoon, easy access for the water taxis, the vaparetto stops...and throngs of pedestrians. It can get loud, early. When you leave the front door it's like rushing into a madding crowd of humanity. The old, very old, pallazo, is the place to stay. Yes, it's sort of dingy and musty....it is THAT old. The atrium/lobby/entrance is breathtaking. The pictures one sees is pretty much what you get. Amazing. The lobby's Bar Dandolo is magnificent, but a Mai Tai (my specialty, will cost you way too much). Oui, the Danieli is an expensive habit. Splurge, some, enjoy the decor, a lot. I thought service was fantastic. Speak a little Italian, it'll help. Room service is divine, try the club sandwich and tell me it's not the best in the world. It is, I eat them across them globe. The restaurant, ah yes. If the weather is nice, splurge on the terrace view. You shalln't find a more attractive vista in Venice. The food and the sevice? Not up to Luxury Collection standards. Venice has many fine restaurants, Al Covo for one, so get out and enjoy them. Overall, for sheer beauty and history the Danieli is hard to beat. It is expensive and it is \"Venice\". I mean to say, a bit quirky, a little rough in spots. It is not pristine, it shouldn't be, either. Stay in the palace \"Dandolo\" or the Casa Nuova wing. It's an old Venetian castle...luxurious, but frayed here and there.

There are stunning views across the lagoon and along the Grand Canal. It is without doubt a very romantic place. Although our room 285 (on fourth floor) was not located in the old building we still had a side view of the lagoon and San Giorgio. The room was clean, simply laid out and pleasant. The d\u00c3\u00a9cor had a touch of 17th century, which was befitting especially the fabric wallpaper. The beds were large and comfortable. The bathroom was also large, in many way too large considering the bath itself was just \"normal\" size, toiletries and robes supplied. There was also a dressing room that was useful. Room service was good and whenever we left the hotel the room was tidied and linen changed. The front office manager \"Salvatore\" was very helpful and obliging, as were the many concierges. The city:- Venice is not as big as you may initially imagine and it's not difficult to walk fully across it. There is always something to look at and visualise how Venice has grown up and how many famous luminaries have gone through the experience that you are now in. Initially though it takes a little while to get your bearings as you are more likely to concentrate on the architecture before you, rather than remembering how to get from a to b in the many bustling small lanes around the main sites. The main sites are pretty well sign posted though, and really its not a case of getting lost its just a case of finding a different way! Once you are a hundred or so yards away from any main tourist spot Venice quickly becomes even more slowly paced. Advise for comfort though you buy a map Euros2.5 at one of the many vaparettos stops. Venice is a place for mooching, chilling and enjoying the company you are in while being dazzled in a way that no other city on the planet can compare with. Tips :- The vaparettos are easy to hop on and off and without doubt are an excellent way to travel around the islands and up and down the Grand Canal. Plus shouldn't condone this but we were never challenged for a ticket at all, even though we'd each bought a 72 hour ticket at Euros25 each. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a ticket then I'm advised that they'll just charge you an extra Euro for that particular journey, individual journeys are euros5. As you leave the Danieli there are always guys offering you the chance of your own free motor launch to take you to Murano to see the glass factory. Take this opportunity, it is free and the launch takes you up the Grand Canal before travelling across at speed to Murano. There you will see glass being blown into wonderful shapes then you will be escorted around the many rooms of stylised glass. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a soft sell not pushy at all. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to buy then it's no problem. Then all you have to do is catch the vapaoretto back. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a good trip and allows you to see a bit more of the islands. There are many coffee and patisserie shops, just pop in one you like the look of and try some bruchetta or chocolate pastries which are excellent and won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t break the bank. Whereas eating and drinking at the restaurants situated on the Grand Canal can get a bit pricey. Go into some of the churches they are very ornate. If you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like modern \"art\" give the Guggenheim gallery a miss. Who needs pretension when you are in Venice? Danieli value for money - Staying at the Danieli gives you a feeling of grandeur even though you may not be in the \"old\" part of the hotel. Regarding value for money well that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s up to individual to decide. For those that are not high rollers and are on a reasonable budget they possibly would think that it's overpriced especially drinks and food. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to eat and drink there though, however the roof top restaurant is spectacular.

It made me feel like I was somebody special and they really cared about our stay and how we enjoyed it. This was true in all of our dealings with all of the staff. The concierge was the man in the know and was always prepared to take the time to go through local maps and giving directions to places of interest.

Our room had a balcony where we enjoyed and savored Venice to it's fullest. Champagne, candies and flowers followed shortly. Upon arriving at Marco Polo Airport, our luggage was missing from Gatwick. This did not affect our moods as the Danieli was accomodating with personal necessities (i.e. toothbrush, toothpaste & shaving accessories.) And once our luggage was delivered the next day, the Danieli brought it up to our room immediately. The building we were in was the newer annex (300 yrs old). The room was spacious, well decorated and the bathroom was well equipped with modern ammenities such as separate toilet and bidet. The staff cleaned it twice daily as standard on 5 star hotels. Upon returning from our night out, we would find chocolates on our bed as part of our turn down service. We probably were annoying as patrons because we were constanly asking the concierge and receptionists for information, yet they gracefully took care of our needs as well as the many patrons at the time. The Danieli offered free water taxi shuttle to Lido Beach where we found the Westin and Hotel des Bains and also to Murano Island. The location was superb. It was in the heart of San Marco Square. And the best part, our points paid for our entire stay. We enjoyed the Danieli so much, we ended up extending our stay. The receptionist went as far as making the necessary phone call to make the arrangements for us.

I suggest that others should do the same. Also, another reason I appreciate this independent website. By American standards, it only takes one bug for the Illinois Department of Public Health to shut down a restaurant, this hotel management should think twice in regards to their customer service in a global market. With Venice representing as the crown jewel of Italy, its carat and color is devaluing real fast if establishments such as Danieli Hotel continue to live in the past. Their denial that they are in the \"service\" business, or lack of, for 21st century generation will eventually catch up in ways they will regret.

Upon check-in we were amazed to have been upgraded to the finest suite in the property, the Suite del Doge, which has a rack rate in excess of EURO 5,000 per night.

The historical touches were amazing. Was it perfect? No. This is a very old historical property and yes, it is in dire need of a serious renovation. The flaws and slightly gritty feel of the suite are part of the experience. The Danieli is a gem of a hotel meant for those who appreciate experiencing the unique opportunity of staying in a very historical property. Room service was deplorable. The food was mediocre at best and the prices were astronomical. Late at night they wouldn't even answer the phone in the room service department. The breakfast buffet upstairs on the terrace dining room is not to be missed. An incredible view of Venice and the Grand Canal. Great food and good service. The lobby bar is wonderful. Great drinks, good service and incredible people watching. The Danieli is a magical experience for those who appreciate history and grandeur. It is not for guests who expect great value for money spent nor is it for guests demanding Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons type of Service. I would recommend booking ONLY in the original historical section. The annex wings looked horrible. The original Danieli historical building houses the only rooms worth booking.

We have just returned from Venice Carnevale and after a year of worrying having read some of the reviews about this hotel we wondered what we were letting ourselves in for! For us, the experience was wonderful. I tried my hardest to find fault with the room, service, etc., but could only come up with praise. It was perfect. White fluffy towels changed daily. Crisp white bed linen changed daily. Clean. Staff were very helpful and not brusque as has been mentioned in other views. Welcome gift of chocolates and wine I can only imagine that some rooms must vary but hence so does the price! We paid around \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400 per night including breakfast which was excellent. We did not have a \"room with a view\" but did have a balcony overlooking the street in the newer section of the hotel. It is in the BEST location next to St Marks Square. We toured some of the other 5* hotels and they did not seem as good as ours. We even asked to look in some rooms of other hotels and where available this was granted. Not a patch on what we had. So all I can say was for our experience it was perfect. May be we struck lucky with our room, I don't know, but I can sing 100% praise about the hotel, service, breakfast, comfortability. In fact, everything! I might just add that we are well travelled people and have stayed in a lot of 5* properties and this property will definitely be etched in our minds as a memorable one!

Curiously, the Danieli has the best *and* the worst of the bunch. I'm guessing that most of the TripAdvisor reviewers who've given the Danieli poor reviews stayed in the so-called \"deluxe\" rooms in the newer wings of the hotel (most of which don't face the lagoon). That's how I started my stay there as well, and I was frankly shocked at both the poor, worn-looking condition and lack of \"white-glove\" cleanliness of my room, not to mention its general lack of luxury compared with the posh pictures in the Danieli's marketing materials. It was cramped, dank and altogether tired. You can find vastly superior accommodations for the same price at every other hotel in the Danieli's price range, so I would strongly recommend staying elsewhere if your budget limits you to rooms under \u00e2\u201a\u00ac400/night. There was a strong stench in the room as well, and I eventually figured out that the minibar fridge was broken and something inside had spoiled. I immediately went down and asked to speak to the manager and insisted (nicely) that I couldn't sleep there that night. At first he said the hotel was fully booked, but then he finally relented -- after some hesitation, for reasons that will make themselves clear in a second -- and said that although they indeed didn't have any rooms available for the two consecutive nights of my stay, they had one accommodation free that evening ... specifically the second-largest suite in the original palazzo part of the hotel. I agreed to stay there one night and relocate the following one. What followed was one of THE most memorable hotel experiences of my life. Words honestly fail me in describing the beauty of the palazzo suite, which consumed a good 1500 sq ft over several rooms. Intricate inlaid mosaic tile floors; jaw-droppingly ornate antique furniture and Murano glass chandeliers; delicate damask silk bedspread with matching damask-covered walls; beautiful mahogany doors and bed hardware; and what has to be one of the most stunning lagoon views in the city. I almost cried when I had to relocate the next day, but happy that I was able to stay even if only for one night in a room that normally cost seven times the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac300 rate I was paying. While I'm certain that they don't regularly upgrade people dissatisfied with their standard rooms to their second-nicest suite (I gather only the Royal Suite tops it), I was happy they did so in my case! So, I guess my summation would be as follows: if you can afford \u00e2\u201a\u00ac700 and up for a room or suite in the palazzo part of the hotel, go for it. Your experience will be a wholly memorable one. The junior suites aren't as large as the one I was in, but the decor is just as sumptuous. If your budget restricts you to the hotel's newer, 20th-century-built wings, or if you consider the idea of a \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20 cocktail an affront to your sensibilities, you'll be much better off elsewhere.", "Date": "February 25, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "1", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cDon't worth the price\u201d", "Author": "Sanced", "ReviewID": "UR4473729", "Content": "We stayed at the Danieli during the Carnaval 2006.

Upon arriving in Venice via way of the Grand Canal, one can easily be enamored with its architectural and historical beauty. We were in awe just being in \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Venice\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd. Seeing for the first time what we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve only seen in movies and postcard pictures. That feeling completely evaporated the moment we checked into the Hotel Danieli. We booked this hotel as the Grand Finale of our trip, choosing to spend that extra money for 2 special nights, one being our 1st wedding anniversary. At 600USD a night, I expected a lot more than what we were offered. First, one would expect that a hotel member of the Starwood Luxury Collection would have to adhere to some simple standards. One being a clean room, void of dirt, dust, cracked mirrors in the bathroom and bedroom, cracked glass on the room desk, filthy curtains, and mold on the shower curtain and in the shower. Apparently not. Once I complained about the condition of room, we were offered the option of relocating to another room the following day because all other rooms were already booked. As we were only staying 2 days and were sick of schlepping and repacking our luggage, this seemed ridiculous to do for one night. So we opted to stay in our crappy room since we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be moved any sooner than the following day. The hotel manager (the nicest person we actually encountered at this hotel) then offered to give us \u00c2\u00bd off our stay which we accepted. Then we decided to cool down with some drinks in the lobby. At 16 Euro for a Bellini and 21 Euro for a Gin and Tonic, I wanted to choke. I mean I know Venice is expensive, but come on. The wait staff were borderline rude and mechanical, like Venetian robots. I have to say that Venice is the most inhospitable and cold place I have ever visited. After choking down our 40 Euro drinks we proceeded to the Concierge to make dinner arrangements for our anniversary that evening. Only to be treated like 3rd class citizens because we were unaware that this special Feast of the Redeemer was going on and dinner arrangements at any restaurant with canal views were at 400-500 Euros per person. <<GULP>> There goes that idea. We ended up at a mediocre and overpriced restaurant in one of the many piazzas settling for an experience that fell way below what we had hoped for on our anniversary in what claims to be one of the most romantic cities on the planet. Upon our much anticipated departure from Venice the Danieli quoted us 3 different prices for a water taxi to the airport only to get to the airport and have the boat captain tell us another price. At this point we just wanted to get home and were tired of haggling and being treated like dirt, so we paid our last 100 Euros to the city we would like to leave far behind in our memories. Granted we went during a terribly crowded time of year and probably the most crowded weekend of the summer, but I would still never go back. I compare Venice with a beautiful woman\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6a woman with much exterior beauty, but lacking heart and soul (quite smelly too). Once you crack the shell, there is little appeal.

This is AT BEST a 3 star hotel......and a badly managed one at that. With all due apologies to those who wrote good reviews of this dump.....I can only wonder if you may have been caught up in the undeniable romance of Venice.....and been blinded to the astoundingly bad service and room quality of this vastly overated and overpriced snake pit. First......the rooms. Their excuse for ANY complaint about the run down condition of the place was \"it's a very old, historic hotel\". Right. So this means you can't shampoo the carpets in the rooms? I was afraid to walk barefoot in our room. The carpets were filthy......the paint was dirty as hell in many places.....it really looked as though NOTHING had been done to the room for 10 years. And the fact that it's a historic hotel prevents them from putting in decent beds? I've still got a back ache from the cheap, saggy mattress in our room. And the fact that it's an old, historic hotel means they can't give you decent sheets? You get the cheapest, scratchiest sheets you can imagine. I'm not joking.....it was like being in prison....the sheets were almost like sandpaper....I don't remember EVER feeling sheets that were so scratchy. To think that this hotel is owned by the same chain that owns the Westin hotels...which have the best bedding in the business...in beyond the imagination. Ok...suffice it to say that the rooms are a disaster (at over $500US per night, I should add). How about the service? Again....words can't do justice..... Let's start with the phones.....on THREE occassions I tried to call downstairs to get some info...all three times I tried the hotel operator, the front desk, and finally the concierge. NO ANSWER. I was totally ignored. My wife tried while I was in the shower and had no luck with the hotel operator or the front desk....but finally (on her fourth try) got an answer from the concierge. Even at a Motel 6 you will get an answer when you dial the operator. It seems that they just can't be bothered to pick up the phone. The hallways are full of VERY worn out carpets...and really look like some cheap old flop house...not a 5 a 4 a 3 or even a 2 star hotel. Amazing really. While down in the lobby bar...which is indeed very pretty....as one would expect from a building that 500 years ago was a palace....I was having a Gin and Tonic. This cost me $25.00. This is not a misprint, I said twenty five dollars for a Gin and Tonic. Perhaps I could live with this if not for the haughty and even distainful service offered by the \"waiters\". It's like they have a pre-rehearsed drill....you ask them a question....like....\"what sort of nibbles can we order\"...and they talk to you quickly...moving away from you all the time as though they have someting MUCH more important to do (and this while we were virtually the only people in the joint). I had to get up to go to the bathroom, and not wanting to go all the way up to our room I went to the public bathroom on the ground floor. Big mistake. Dirty.....and I don't just mean a little dirty.....I mean old, stained paint on the doors that nobody had bothered to clean in a VERY long time. No paper towels in the container to dry my hands. My wife had to go a little while later and reported not only the above complaints about the Ladies room, but also no toilet paper!!. She stopped at the front desk to complain on the way back to the table and was told \"We can't check all the time, a lot of people use it\". Jesus. It really sounds like I have some sort of grudge against this place, but the truth is we were VERY hopeful that it would be good and tried valiantly to find something good about the place. But the simple fact is that it is the DEFINITION of tourist trap. I've stayed in 5 star hotels in over 30 countries and this is not just the worst of all of them...but the worst by 500 miles. I can't even think of which one would be next up the ladder......the Danieli is so far \"ahead\" in the race for rock bottom. We went up with two friends to try dinner on the famous Terrace restaurant on the roof. We actually *were* treated quite well there....friendly and attentive waiters and hosts. The food, however, was only so-so. Not bad, by any means....but at $45-$50 for an entree, you expect a much higher standard of cooking. No artistry in the presentation.....little if no skill exhibited in the sauce department....just standard....\"throw the lamb chop on the grill and slap it on the plate\" fare. Overall, I can say without ANY doubt that this is the single worst hotel experience I've ever had......and I've had a few real doozies, believe me. If you stay in this pest hole you will only have yourself to blame. Venice is a tourist trap in general...with a LOT of very bad food and service...all at very high prices.......but the Danieli is the leader of the pack when it comes to *completely* focusing on how much money they can get out of you while doing the absolute *least* amount of work possible. Venice is beautiful, but I'm beginning to think it's not worth the bother. I've been three times now, and I doubt I'll go back. If you do go, I'd either get a very cheap 2 star hotel (it won't be any worse than the Gritti Palace or Danili, and at least you'll only be paying $100 a night, so you won't be terminally offended...or perhaps, if you insist on spending more for a \"luxury\" hotel...you could stay at the Monaco & Grand Canal...which actually is pretty good (within the greater context of the Venice hotel market.....don't think for a second that you'll like it as much as a *real* grand hotel.....like the Ritz in London, the Shangri-La in Bangkok, the InterContinental in Hong Kong, etc).

It seems strange that the review on the Danieli are all over the map. My only complaint was the only English TV was CNN and BBC, and sometimes an english movie on Skyservice. I had booked a mini suite and it was in the 'new' building (350 years old) and it was exquisite, on floor A and faced the water, boats, and all. Close the windows, no noise - open them and the whole world seems to be out there having loads of fun. We were using Starwood points for this stay, so don't really know what it would cost - but we were certainly treated as paying customers by everyone. Check in was easy and fast - we were tired from the train ride from Florence - and there was a bottle of free champagne waiting, along with a specialty box of chocolates. While there a special services rep came in to fill a large bowl with Lindt chocolates that try as I would wouldn't empty by the time we left. The turn down service left even more chocolates - a totally different kind. Quite different from the Westin Excelsior in Florence where we got nothing 'extra' even with turn-down. We were in the Danieli palace and treated like the king and queen from the moment we arrived. Rumour has it the Danieli is being purchased by Marriott. Dinner in the hotel dining room was a bit of a shocker for 212 euros for two...the main culprits being booze: rum & coke 21 euros, manhattan 16 euros; water 8 euros; cover charge 16 euros (for 2). The dinner was a mixed fish platter for two (98 euros) which was outstanding (I'm not a fish eater either) and had scampi, sole, monkfish, seabass and fresh salad. The service was great and we were told that if we wanted to tip anything additional to please do it with cash...all restaurants seem to do that in Italy. I'd go back to Danieli and have the same meal again - only with just wine (37 euros). This hotel has location, location, location. Every main sight is nearby and you can walk to the Rialto quite easily. There is something special about Venice in spite of the fact everyone tries to rip you off. The water taxi should have been 45 euros, but ended up at 80 for the 'Grand Canal route' from the train station. The water taxi to the airport was 90 euros plus another 25 euros for porters to help us with heavy bags and drive to the airport from there (about a 10 min drive). I bought a DVD of Venice in a shop only to find when getting home it was a counterfeit copy made on somebodies computer, but it worked. There is a Venice day life and a night life - don't miss either, especially at St. Mark's area. Safe and fun...and a great king bed (2 singles joined) with great pillows, we slept like babies. Don't miss it, but be good friends with your bank manager.", "Date": "May 15, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "2", "Service": "2", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cVenice was Danieli for us.\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR3447730", "Content": "Beautiful hotel! very expensive though, however if money is not object then it is a must stay.

The front desk manager greeted me and took me away from this chaos to my room. Take the new wing much quiter and in a way nicer (less idiosyncratic) than the old. All staff were wonderful. I had a lagoon view room and walked in to see a beautiful room with a terrace and the most amazing view. Left immediately to explore and noted that the huge chaos of just 20 minutes ago had dissipated. When I returned the Hotel had left a gift of wine and fruit in my room. Whilst it is a bit on the expensive side it is fully justified when you consider its location and those views.

The Danieli is a very historic hotel and as a guest it is nice to be able to look around this hotel at your lesiure. The building is very old, charming the atrium is lovely, and it has a lovely writing room. The restaurant on the top floor has a beautiful view, and that alone makes it worth having a breakfast up there. On the down side, many of the hotel staff seem very moody, as if to bring this room service order to your room has really put them out. I got this message continually from staff. At the 50 Euro breakfast service was non-existant. I eventually made eye contact with a waiter, who then rushed off in the opposite direction when it was obvious that I might ask him for something, such as another coffee. The \"hot\" food at the breakfast was also lukewarm/cool. My room was nice, comfortable. The bathroom was in dire need of refurbishment. Everytime you walk into the hotel, if you are dressed casually (as you tend to be in summer), the staff stop you until you explain that you are a guest.

Stayed here between Christmas and New Year 2004. It is true the lobby is spectacular and the lounge is also very charming in a 'faded grandeur deopping to bits kind of way'. We had to wait an age at reception whilst the miserable clerk fumbled his way around the new computer system. Our room was at least in the original palazzo though it was a bit tatty - the bathroom reminding me of a home-made addition. Staff were cordial, breakfast was satisfactory but certainly not worth 62 Euros each and the restaurant is vastly overpriced for the ambeance and the quality of the food. Much better to eat at the Londra Palace just a few Palazzi along - where the food was exceptionally well priced and of much better quality. I agree with previous reviewers that the Bauer is better value for money - however I will return to an old favourite (the Kette) when I am next in Venice. Beware the concierge offering a free private water taxi to Murano - once there you are subjected to a tour of the glass factory (which was interesting for about 5 minutes) - then the hard sell of buy some glass - if you ate not interested, they palm you off with a free vaporetto ticket for the public transport back.

We know from past experience never to expect a hotel room to be ready early in the morning, so since we arrived at 8:00 AM we were not surprised to find out that our room was not ready. The staff invited us to wait in the lobby, but since we only had a day and a half to spend in Venice, our favorite city, we left and returned at noon, when we were told our room would be ready. We did return at noon, only to be told to come back again in a half and hour. To make a long story short, we continued to return every half an hour until 5:00 when we felt the need to get aggressive with the person at the front desk, who not only did not apologize for requiring us to continue to return every half an hour for six hours, but only said they did not have enough help to clean the rooms. Since we were in Venice in October, and had made our reservations 10 month prior to our trip, I think it is unbelieveable that a five star hotel would not be aware of how many rooms would be need for those days and have enough employees there to ready the rooms. When we finally got our room (in the old section, which we requested), we were very disappointed in the quality of the room. It was small and dark, and cost $675 American. We were more than prepared to pay that price to stay at a hotel with the reputation of the Danieli, but we feel it was too much money to spend in this instance since the hotel clearly did not live up to its reputation. We have stayed in many 5 star hotels in the past, and this was the worst room we have ever stayed in in a hotel of that caliber. We did not request another room primarily because the staff was so unaccomodating to begin with. In the future, when we visit Venice will gladly return to the Bauer, which is a wonderful hotel, and does live up to its reputation. Although the lobby of the Danieli is lovely, I would advise anyone considering this hotel to reethink their choice or not have expectations that are too high.", "Date": "November 16, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Danieli", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187870-d194256-Reviews-Hotel_Danieli-Venice_Veneto.html", "Price": "$442 - $1,142*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Castello, 4196</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Riva degli Schiavoni</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">30122</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Venice</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Italy</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "194256", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/dd/02/dd02f3976482a2a4c48f10d30ed403e05large.jpg"}}
