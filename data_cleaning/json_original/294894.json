The staff were helpful but the hotel itself is away from the main tourist area. There are good links to the main area from the tram which is located 50m in front of the hotel. We decided to get the Metro to the hotel from the airport. The hotel's website says that the nearest Metro stop is Ulubatli which is 200m from the hotel. Read into this but it's 200m 'as the crow flies'. If you decide to get to the hotel this way, walk out of the metro station and walk straight down to the sets of traffic lights halfway down the road. Cross over and walk up the road and when you get to the 'spilt' in the road, take the right fork and walk up the hill to the square where the big turkish flag is located. Turn left at the roundabout and walk down to the next set of lights where you will see the tram stop and the Holiday Inn in front of you. Look right and you'll see the hotel. We stayed in a 'premium room' which was very clean and spacious. The spa area was very good but if you want to go swimming make sure you take a swimming hat or you'll have to buy one for 5TL. We decided not to have breakfast as it is expensive at 15 Euros per person per day and we also did not eat dinner at the hotel as we found it offered a limited selection but did offer a buffet. I would suggest eating in the local areas, however we could only find 'kebab style' resturants with small eating areas in them close to the hotel. My recommendations would be to go to the area of Sultanahmet on the tram where you can eat both local cuisine and more 'western style' cuisine as well. The side streets near to the Basilica Cistern offer reasonable prices and good cuisine. The hotel is away from the touristic area but the tram is close and cheap to travel on at 2TL per 'jeton'. I would recommend this hotel to anyone but be prepared to travel to the touristic areas about 10-15 minutes on the tram.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cFine for us\u201d", "Author": "Sparklyfeet", "ReviewID": "UR127864176", "Content": "We liked the big room and the spa in the basement.

It's fine. The room is pretty good in an it-could-be-anywhere marble bathroom way and it has an ok pool. The obvious downside to this hotel is the thing that they can't change: it's a little bit out of the way. But, as everyone says, the tram stops right outside the hotel and goes to all the useful places: - Beyaziy for The Grand Bazaar - Sultanhamet for the sights (15 mins) - Eminonu for Boshphorus cruises - Over Galata bridge to Karajoy (25 mins) for all the restaurants, rooftop bars etc. in Beyoglu. The tram is dead easy to use and less than a \u00c2\u00a31 / \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1.20 a journey. I was pretty happy with this hotel because I got it for a good rate on Hotwire on Easter weekend (and got breakfast elsewhere instead of paying 15 Euros a head for a hotel buffet). The location was most annoying when I wanted to go back to my hotel and relax a bit (there's NOTHING nearby). It's also a long \u00c2\u00a345 / \u00e2\u201a\u00ac50 taxi ride to Sabiha Gokcen airport which is where Easyjet flies into (factor that faff and cost in if you book a budget flight). Get a metered taxi from the hotel and airport - don't pay the hotel's markup for a transfer. If I came again I'd stay in Beygolu - it's better to be near the restaurants and bars than the sights really. If money was no object I'd stay at Witt Istanbul suites (twice the price of the Erecin) but I don't think I could've done better for this price range. PS the WIFI didn't work in my room. PPS go to Muzedechanga for a nice but not too extravagantly-priced dinner if you can. Even though it's a \u00c2\u00a315 / \u00e2\u201a\u00ac18 taxi ride or a tram trip to Kabatas then a long (on Saturday night anyway) bus journey on the 22 to Sakip Sabanci Museum (buy a bus card from a news vendor).", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edinburgh, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cExcellent stay\u201d", "Author": "msq123", "ReviewID": "UR126920776", "Content": "We stayed in Barcelo Eresin Topkapi for 2 days.

Rooms are nice (I was in the deluxe) and I reserved with a special offer, but otherwise it was 325 euro and it's not worth that money. Particoularly because the room was very noisy: you could here everything from the corridory and the presence of lots of children did not help in that sense.

I've been to Istanbul 5 times and have always said the Turks are among the nicest people in the world - that's why I keep coming back! First, this is NOT a 5 star hotel and I feel jipped by lastminute.com. They need to re-categorize this hotel to a 4-star max. The day before my arrival, I called to ask for early check-in. I was told about the 45 euro charge but was told that since I was fasting, they would check me in early at no charge. When i went to check in, I was treated like a criminal! The man spent the entire 20 minutes trying to find out if the person I spoke to really was working the day before. After total silence for several minutes of investigating, he handed me my card key without a word then rudely told me he would be reprimanding the person who promised to waive the 45 euros but that he's given me a room anyway and will waive it. I had to locate the elevators myself. The Room I was given a room with two twin beds with a view of the parking lot. All i can say is I have never in my life, even in personal bathrooms, have I seen such a destroyed bathtub. The plaster was peeling badly in 2 locations, whereby if you stepped on it, you would seriously cut yourself. The toilet seat cover was yellow. At first I thought it was an odd color with a backdrop of a white porcelain toilet, but realized it was stained yellow. GROSS. Given I flew in on a red-eye, I desperately needed sleep before a meeting. But after 3 hours of tossing and turning, I could not sleep. The AC was broken and I was hot. I finally couldn't put up with it and called and asked for another room. Thank God, this time it was a gracious receptionist and she moved me to a better room. But after moving to the new room, I realized the guy who checked me in didn't return my passport so I called. He insisted he gave it to me and they asked me to return to my old room to look for it. I went and when I returned they called to say they found it at the front desk. I was not only sleep-deprived, I was hot and sweaty at this point. Upon my check out, the issue of the 45 euros came up again! I was told that they called lastminute.com and confirmed it was disclosed on their website and therefore they needed to charge me! I was appalled at the time they spent investigating this issue. Of course, I argued that I was told it was waived TWICE now and I refused to pay. Other Cons -Amenities are CHEAP. You can't even use the bath cap without ripping it. Tissues are like cardboard. Soap/Shampoo is like detergent. No robe. Cheap paper slippers. -Cheap linens. - The bathroom counters, floors and bathub all had water stains, especially the counter and floors. Felt dirty. -They have no respect for the \"Do Not Disturb Sign\" -They charge 44 TL (~$32) for a really simple breakfast buffet with no omlette bar or anything special. Again, was treated like a criminal, as they reminded me 3 times that there is an extra charge for breakfast. I never returned. -Location: not convenient to anything. -Hair \"salon\": It was nothing more than a run-down barber and the woman there tried ripping me off by quoting me 50 TL for a simple blow out. The going rate is 5-10TL. Maybe 20 in fine hotel salons. The thing is, the woman working at the spa witnessed this and said nothing but her face said it all.

We chose the hotel as it had a spa and was close to a tram route and while there were good and bad points to the stay, I definitely wouldn't stay there again. On the plus side: 1. Check in was easy and at that time reception were friendly and although we arrived early, we only had to wait 10 minutes or so for our rooms. 2. Rooms were large, modern, comfortable and kept very clean. 3. My friends all used the spa and said it was nice. 4. The tram stop is literally outside the hotel making it easy to get into the city centre. 5. There was free wifi and Internet access. Unfortunately, for me, the negatives outweighed these positives: 1. Other than housekeeping and door staff who were great, others were not what you would expect at 5* hotel. Reception staff were unhelpful and unwilling to book restaurants - and when a number was engaged and we asked for another recommendation just told us to eat in their restaurant! Not very helpful, and the restaurant really doesn't compare with the nightlife over in Beyoglou, Sultanhammet etc where we had some great meals. Bar staff were very slow to serve, and didn't always bring what you had ordered - wrong drinks, toppings missing on pizza and ice cream etc. 2. The location isn't great even with the tram. There's a busy road and the tram running in front of the hotel and a very tired-looking residential block behind (my room looked out onto some corrugated roofs with rubbish thrown on top!). The tram runs really regularly, is clean and cheap, but always extremely busy. More often than not you will be standing (if you can even get on the tram at peak times) and the 15-minute journey ends up feeling like a commute. If you're a tourist then chances are you'll head into town during the day, come back to get changed and then head into town again to eat (as nightlife around the hotel isn't good) which means four tram trips. This quickly gets boring. 3. Be careful if booking a taxi through the hotel. We asked for two cabs to take us back to the airport and they had Barcelo Eresin written on the side. They tried to charge us 25 Turkish Lira more than was on the meter per cab (and 30 Lira more than we'd paid on arrival following the same route) to cover the tolls. As we'd seen the toll charges at each stopping point, this was vastly over-inflated. The exchange, during which they initially threatened us with the tourist police and then backed down when we stood our ground, left a really nasty taste and I would advise just flagging your own taxi down to ensure no hidden charges appear on your bill. Other minor points are the cost of breakfast and drinks at the hotel - they're high, but that's usual for 5* hotels. There is a Shell garage and a supermarket two minutes walk away if you want to get water or snacks at lower prices. And the hotel safe confused all six of us and we had to put three calls into Reception to come and reset the safes in all three rooms. None of us could find the reset button mentioned on the instructions and ended up locked out of our safes! The reset button is inside the safe door between the hinges if you're wondering!", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Huddersfield, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cNice but Average...\u201d", "Author": "Shax", "ReviewID": "UR79473403", "Content": "Firstly I would say that Istanbul is so friendly and enjoyable that it doesnt matter where you stay!

We did have to change room once as the bathroom noises from the next room were very audible and the at reception I was told that the walls are thin and even if we move we will still have the similar problem. Having moved we did find it quieter in the new room but then there was a problem with our bathroom! it kept flushing. An engineer did come and sort it out after a couple of hours or so. The location is as many other have stated; trams are opposite the hotel and allow you to mix with the locals but to be honest after a few trips you do wish you were closer to the action, i.e. the area around the Blue Mosque etc. This is because trams do get VERY busy at times and feels like your back in the UK commuting during work hours. There is a mosque literally around the corner and a supermarket, this was very handy for myself being a Muslim. Oh and the the indoor swimming pool was GREAT!

I really think the management should avoid such a monopoly , I really prefer a melting pot when I travel so I could understand and make friends with different races and nationalities.

A special thank you goes to the F/O Manager Safi who helped make everything worthwhile. The Hotel is equal in quality to other five star hotels in the main tourist areas but the price (because of its location) is much better. It has a fantastic gym & very nice spa, together with sauna steam room, large swimming pool & Turkish bath. It also has a Prayer room, which was very useful, & there is a small mosque within 100yds of the hotel. I used the hotel facilities each morning and never got bored. For swimming pool usage a swimming cap must be used (5euros for cap) the location is slightly out the way for tourists visiting the Sultan-Ahmed district, however there is a fantastic tram service outside the hotel, which runs every 5 mins to the main tourist sites. (1.5 lira one-way regardless of distance). There are approx 6 stops before you get to blue mosque. 20mins journey. I strongly recommend that anyone who wishes to get a feel for Istanbul commute via tram as you get to admire the local areas in and around Sultan \u00e2\u20ac\u201cAhmed District. Besides if you wish to do a spot of shopping the tram stops at several stops and all along the routes there are hundreds of shops selling anything and everything. However a point to note is the tram gets very busy during peak times so be warned. Our experience of Istanbul was beyond our expectations; our treatment was 5 star and once again thanks to the guys at our hotel. Also a mention about Osman the (bellboy), great lad and very helpful as always. The hotel does provide a map to the main places and just ask the front desk guys and they will help direct you. We stayed for 7 nights and spent it as follows: Day1: visited the Blue Mosque (a must see wonder) & Hagi Sofia (also recommended) blue mosque has no entrance fee but Hagia Sofia is 10lira per person. From our hotel its approx 6stops and once you get off at Sultan-Ahmed it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a further 5mins walk. You can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t miss it as the magnificent buildings tower above the skyline. Day2: Visited Topkapi Palace (must see wonder) entrance fee is 20lira. The location is towards the right side of Hagia Sofia, it is not well signposted so don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t panic if you cant find it just ask someone. You will need approx 3-4 hrs here; it gets very busy with tourists and bring a good camera. (Just a note you cannot take pics inside the Haram as it holds some sacred Islamic items. For Muslims this place is not to be missed. The surrounding courtyards are an ideal place to have a picnic. The views are fab. Day3: Bosporus Cruise, get the tram to Eminuno, get off and go under small subway and once out, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s towards your right side. You wont miss it, as a number of boats are ready waiting to take people on cruises. Don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take the commercial ferries, as they will only do a short cruise, get a medium sized boat and it costs 10lira for a 1.5hr cruise. We caught a boat which had BOGAZ24.COM splashed across it. The cruise itself is wonderful you get to see many places of interest on the way around, again take a good camera. & Remember to take a jumper as it can get Cold. Also take some food, as there is not much choice on board. Tea sellers are about and a cup is 1lira. Day4: Eyup: This place is perhaps one of the most wonderful places to visit if you want to chill out, away from the hordes of tourists. Best way to get here is by taxi and the cost from our hotel was 8lira. There is a Mosque called Ayuub Sultan (Companion of Prophet Mohammed). This place is of immense value to Muslims as the grave of Abu Ayuub Ansari is here. Once done from the mosque take a Teleflex (cable cart) (1.5lira each way) to Pier Loti, where you have amazing views of the Bosporus. You can take a coffee here and just admire the views. You could spend a whole day in Eyup, as there are also many small shops around to keep you busy. Prices here are better than the main Sultan-Ahmed District. Day5: Princes Islands, there are a series of 5 islands, the largest and most touristy is Buyukada, however we chose to go to Heybeliada. To get here you will need to get a ferryboat from KABATAS. To get to Kabatas a tram will be best as it goes direct. The ferry costs 3lira per person one-way and tickets can be purchased from the station. This island is the 4th island and it is a 2hr ferry ride. You will get an announcement at every stop, however only in Turkish so you have to count the stops yourself. Once you get here you can just relax, take in the magnificent views, go to one of many small shops and just chill. There are no cars on this island so travel is via cycle or horse and carriage. A 40mins tour on horse and carriage will cost 35lira, prices are non negotiable. Or you could hire a bike (not sure of costs). Nevertheless you can spend an entire day here admiring the island. Day 6: Grand Bazaar, this is a place to go if you are prepared to walk and walk. To get here you can get a tram, which is the 2nd or 3rd stop after blue mosque stop. They call it Grand for a good reason, it has more than 4000 shops, however everyone seems to sell the same thing, which is annoying, and the prices are touristy prices, so no deals here. I wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t recommend taking children, as the walks can be long. Nevertheless a visit to Istanbul isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t complete without a bazaar tour. Day 7: Underground Cistarn, built around 532ad it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no ore than a place, which holds water. It has its history, however I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d stay away from here, as there is nothing to see but columns upon columns. The ticket price is 10lira. The last day was spent shopping around; we bought some nice souvenirs and spent it walking around the main Sultan-Ahmed area enjoying a picnic. We visited the new mosque at Eminuno, had fish sandwich from one of many fishing boats.

I explained again and it seems like they understood what I am looking for. Half an hour later nobody came to my room so I called again. Overwall I waited 1 hour for the tooth brush and paste to be delivered. Toalets are not the best as sometimes it would flush, sometimes you would have to try 5-6 times to get it to flush.

They wouldn't clear the tables fast, they never offer me a coffee or tea, I had to chace them for it as well as milk and sugar! Usually milk would be at the table and sugar but becasue it was busy there was nothing there. The same scanario happened every morning for 4 days. Only on the 5th day when the restaurant was quite empty I was given coffee straight away. Again they didn't speak English becasue when I aked for knife (there was none on my table) they didn't know what I am aking for and they had to call the manager. There is no proper consiarge service which was very negative side. People at the reception spoke so little English that they couldn't really give you any advice even if you ask them. Although I was there on business I wanted to explore Istanbul a little bit and there was no advice or suggestions which was a shame. I had to do reserach by myself and also find my own way to the city centre and beyond.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Orlando", "Title": "\u201cdon't look any further\u201d", "Author": "Youssef-orlando", "ReviewID": "UR57727029", "Content": "Words can not express my splendid trip to Istanbul on my birthday and thanks to Barcelo eresin topkapi I had the best trip ever. Before going to istanbul I did so many research about the area and its hotels. I end up choosing Barcelo and I did the perfect choice. I would like to express a special thanks to Mr Juan Miralles, the operation manager, who once I checked-in I was sent a nice chocolate cake as a gift for my birthday, that was a very nice gesture to start my vacation with. Most of the reception desk team are very friendly and yes they do speak descent english, you just have to be patient as they will do their best to listen to your request, respond back and accomodate you. remember you're not in the U.S so when people speak to you in english that's a plus. I did call many times for extra blankets and keys and they were delivered in no time. the hotel is more likely a 4 star to the US standards. Yet, the ameneties are just amazing, they have indoor swimming pool, jacuzzi, sauna, steaming room and Turkish Hammam, what else can you ask for. some people were complaining the hotel si too far. my answer is if you want to be in taksim or beyoglu area then good luck with that. first those areas are way too noisy, second most of taksim hotels dont have half of the amenities that barcelo has, if yes they charge you triple what barcelo does. Barcelo is located at topkapi area, very safe and quiet, 2 minutes away from the tramway...I dont think I ever spent more that 5 minutes wait time and it cost a 1.50 lira which is about a dollar, it will take you to sultanahmet 10 min taksim 20 min and it is a lovely ride as you get to see the whole city and experience it with locals. There is also a supemarket 2 minutes away where you can get water and juices cheap. just make sure you buy a swimming cap in advance as you will need that for the swimming pool. again thanks Mr Juan Mirales and the whole barcelo team for making my trip a memorable one and I will definitely book Barcelo again on my next trip to Istanbul.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Distrito Federal", "Title": "\u201cGreat Experience\u201d", "Author": "Icecreamcherry", "ReviewID": "UR53979375", "Content": "I stayed here during our 5 days visit to Istambul and had the best experience in such a different country for us mexicans.

DEFINITELY NOT A 5 STAR!!!\u201d", "Author": "abbey_315", "ReviewID": "UR48437127", "Content": "We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. First of all, this hotel is nowhere NEAR a 5 star hotel! I will say from the exterior, and the lobby, we expected the rooms and service to be much better... we were disappointed. When we arrived at noon, we were asked to come back in an hour and a half because our room wasn't ready. No big deal, we walked a few blocks down and ate lunch and walked through the shopping area. When we came back to check in, the clerk at the front desk asked about our room preferences, which were also chosen when the room was booked-- non-smoking, one double bed. Well, first they put us in a room with two single beds, so we called and asked to be moved to a room with one double bed. Then, we were put into a room with a double bed, but this time it was a smoking room, yuck. So, we called yet again, and finally got a non-smoking room with a double bed. The attendant that they sent up acted like it was an inconvenience for him, and then lingered like he was waiting around for a tip... sorry, we were not in the mood to tip after having to shuffle around to 3 different rooms! The room: The room stunk! It smelled like it had been a smoking room and they shampooed the carpets. There was a lingering odor. The carpets did not look like they had been vacuumed after the last guests left; there were visible crumbs of some sort on the carpet. The room just didn't seem like it was maintained very well in general. One day we had purchased a bag of chips, and I dropped a piece of chip on the floor accidentally. I said to my husband, \"I think I'll just leave it there and see if they actually vacuum.\" When we returned later, my husband took a bottle of water out of a grocery sack that we had of snacks and said \"well, here's the chip\", instead of vacuuming the chip up, they decided to put it into our grocery sack... The bathroom: The water pressure in the shower was a complete JOKE!!! When you turned the hot water on in the tub it literally trickled out, so, if you wanted more pressure, you would have to turn on the cold water really high. Take your pick-- either a hot shower that drips out, or a cold shower with some (not good) water pressure. Additionally, the glass shower divider door would not stay closed, so water got all over the bathroom. The toilet was hit or miss! Sometimes it would flush, sometimes you would have to try 4 times to get it to flush. My husband and I commented that we had never stayed at a hotel and actually run out of soap... they are very stingy with giving out soap-- we were given one tiny bar during the time that we stayed there which was evidently to be used at both the sink and in the shower, and that we used up completely. Thank goodness I didn't choose to pay for the hotel breakfast everyday when I booked the room! We didn't eat the hotel breakfast until the very last morning, after we checked out and were on our way to the airport. I walked through, and thought that it might be good based upon the signs next to the chafing dishes. I thought perhaps the breakfast was the saving grace of the hotel... NO! We paid about $50 for the two of us for a TERRIBLE breakfast! We had NO service, I mean NONE! We had to flag someone down to give us coffee, then not a single one of our plates was cleared from the table, we just had to stack them up, and on a small two person table, that doesn't leave much room for anything else. The bacon was cold, not just lukewarm, literally cold, as in it was pre-cooked, just came out of the refrigerator and the fat had congealed on it. The scrambled eggs were just runny mush and tasted like they were strictly egg yolks. There were little scoops of mashed potatoes-- obviously frozen, packaged stuff-- they were hard on the outside and ice cold on the inside. Then, there were \"mixed omlettes\" which were just thin pieces of burned eggs... what the heck? It was as if they just poured egg onto a griddle, let it over cook, then threw it in the dish to serve. There was a reasonable selection of fruit, and fruit juices. One guy asked me where I got the bacon; I pointed and told him it's really cold as if it just came out of the refrigerator and he said \"well, you either eat, or you don't eat.\" Clearly, he was on one of the tour groups who were locked into eating that breakfast every morning. When we were done we were beyond upset with our stay at the hotel in general, and the breakfast which cost us about $50 was just the icing on the cake. $50 for breakfast is fairly pricey in the U.S. but about what you would expect to pay at a 5 star hotel for breakfast, so for $50 in Turkey, you would expect a damn good breakfast... NO. We didn't use the pool, but it looked pretty nice. It was crowded when we walked through. My husband got a massage which he thought was not very good. We actually liked the location of the hotel. We were glad to be out of the completely touristy areas. We spent one night in Sultanhamet, so we felt like we got that experience. The tramway is right outside of the door, and it's about a 10 minute ride to Sultanhamet for about $1.50 per person/ per ride. The tramway will also take you close to most of the attractions. The other nice thing was that there was a Shell gas station right next to the hotel, so we would stop there every day to get bottled water and snacks. The bottled water there was .50 Turkish lira compared to some absurd amount that they were charging at the hotel-- something like 4 Turkish lira. Would I recommend this hotel to a friend? No. I'm sure there are MUCH better options! The staff in general seemed like they had a chip on their shoulders, and were not eager to help, and the facilities need to be updated. Not to mention the terrible, overpriced breakfast. The only plus was that we had wireless internet access for free.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "1", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel, shame about the surroundings...\u201d", "Author": "Made4areason", "ReviewID": "UR48385650", "Content": "Really nice hotel and the staff were amazing helpful pointing out stuff on the map for us.

Prior to the trip I spent a lot of time on the net searching for a hotel in Istanbul, a city we were visiting for the 1st time. I was at first very tempted to book one of the hotels around the Sultahahmet or Sirkeci areas (near the attractions) but found that many did not have a pool (a must for my children). Those that did have pools were too expensive. I came across the Eresin Topkapi in one of my searches on this site. It met most of my criteria and the price was good. Of course there were good reviews. I was a little apprehensive by some comments about the hotel being 'far away' from the attractions. Having considered all factors, I decided to 'take a risk' and booked the hotel online via Barcelo's site. On our arrival, we were pleasantly greeted by the hotel's very nice facade. Oh yes, we got a free transfer too! The stay at the hotel was all I expected (and wanted) and more! The kids loved the pool. My wife enjoyed the jacuzzi and I managed to do my laps at the pool. The sauna was great too. We did not have breakfast at the hotel as we wanted only halal. The front desk staff was always ready to help with directions. I was pleasantly surprised to find an envelope under the room door soon after we checked-in. In it was a prayer time schedule for the period of our stay. As for location, the tram station in front of the hotel was very convenient. We hopped on a tram every day to get to the attraction sites (even to as far as Taksim). All the attractions were located along the tram line. The major modern shopping centres are not too far too by metered-taxi (which does not cost much anyway) As for food, we were spoilt for choice from the many restaurants and food outlets within 3 minutes walk from the hotel. I must add that the Premier Club Room we stayed in was superb. Very spacious, very clean with a good view of the front of the hotel. I have travelled quite a bit and I must say that I got more than what I paid for here at the Eresin Topkapi. It was definitely value for money. If you want luxury, comfort and good location without costing you the sky, you must give this hotel a try. You will arrive with a smile and leave with an even bigger one! My thanks to the staff and management of the Barcelo Eresin Topkapi. One thing for sure, wherever else I travel to in the future I will look out for a Barcelo hotel.

After reading some very negative comments on Trip Advisor, I was apprehensive when booking this hotel. Just inside the old city walls, but well outside the centre, the remote location has its benefits. There are no mosques within earshot so our sleep was never disturbed by the call to prayers.

The service is much better then in the Alntalya hotels. Rooms are spacious and clean. The breakfast in well worth its cost of 15 Euros. They did charge a breakfast fee for my 4 year old child. When I booked my hotel I did not include a breakfast, indeed you can have a breakfast on have it billed to your room in daily basis. I did it this way just because sometimes I miss my breakfast hours therefore I don't want to pay if I don't use it. The lobby bar prices and mini bar prices are way to high. A beer costs 16 Lira (9 Euro). A 0.5L bottle of water 5 lira. Instead there is a nerby shop called Mavi File around 150 meters away where you can get your drinks at market prices. The pool is open from 7AM until 10PM which is very convenient. However make sure you bring a swimming cap with you if you don't want to buy it at the hotel for 10 YTL (6 Euro). Also you can not use you cell phones in the pool area and swimming in the main pool is prohibited for children under 12. One of the most useful things is that hotel has 3 yellow taxis that can take you anywhere with a regular taxi metered fare. Being a hotel taxi, you are sure that you will not be driven around to be overcharged as you always have a place to address you dissatisfaction. Although taxis were always busy driving hotel guests around, I never had to wait more than 5 minutes until the taxis were back in front of the hotel. Beware that elevators are not air conditioned therefore during 1 minute of their use you can get extremely hot and sweat. Hotel has also a security gate which happens to be very annoying is it always beeps when you enter or exit the gate. Non of the security staff ever stopped anyone therefore I don't see a point of having a hotel gate with metal detector. You can also change currency at the hotel but at a rate 5% lower than elsewhere therefore make sure you don't change large amounts of money at the hotel. Overall, the hotel is not a 5 star hotel but rather a 4 star one, which is still not bad for the price you pay.", "Date": "June 27, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "California", "Title": "\u201cGreat food, ambience and lovely helpful employees\u201d", "Author": "travelorCalifornia", "ReviewID": "UR16751129", "Content": "The people at reception were terrific. They were very helpful in assisting me even w/the most minor of problems. The breakfast buffet is one of the best! The food is varied and excellent, both in the resturant and the lobby cafe. They also have a great shop Inci 2 Seramik where you can buy lots of great items, small or large purchases. I had a minor complaint with a service and my bill was adjusted most fairly. The maid service and bellman service was above reproach. I would go back there any time.", "Date": "June 7, 2008"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Barcelo Eresin Topkapi", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d294894-Reviews-Barcelo_Eresin_Topkapi-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$116 - $222*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Millet Caddesi 186</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Istanbul</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">34104</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Turkey</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "294894", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/cf/a7/9c/barcelo-eresin-topkapi.jpg"}}
