Water temp (i.e. hot) is not always available. Small water heater must be shared with entire building. Time your showers accordingly.

We arrived before our rooms were ready so they kept our bags while we stopped in the bar for a drink, Jennifer the day bartender greeted us with a smile and for the remainder of our stay always said good morning even remembered our names. You couldn't ask for a more perfect spot, right on the beach and beautifully decorated, plenty of chairs, couches and little nooks and crannies to sit and kick back, a little piece of paradise. Rooms were more than adequate, always clean. The no hot water comments are unfounded as the water was so hot you had to be careful when you got in the shower. Breakfast in the mornings was lovely lots of choices and beautifully presented the staff were always attentive making sure they didn't run out of anything. The hotel manager was present everyday and was genuinely concerned that our stay was everything that we hoped it would be. This is a small hotel with a down to earth friendly atmosphere so if your looking for all the bells and whistles a resort would be better, if your looking for a relaxing laid back vacation this is perfect.

With the bed and the side tables in the room, I barely had enough room to open my suitcase. The bathroom was basically a closet. When I went to have a shower, I didn't have enough room to wash my hair, and then the shower went from scalding hot to ice cold in the matter of seconds. Also, my room was located right above the water pump, so anytime that someone else in the hotel would use the water, the pump would run.

The Beach House is a small, classic-style hotel with a great (low) number of rooms -- no overcrowding at all. It includes all the lovely touches that make Caribbean hotels special. Originally, our reason for choosing this hotel was its size -- to that was added flowers, arches over the doors, small but very comfortable rooms with amazing beds -- we slept like babies! The staff is friendly, quick, helpful in every way we asked them to be. The bar and restaurant are both outdoors on the beach, and the hotel has a great collection of overstuffed chairs and couches, lovely day beds with curtains, and a reasonable amount of Puerto Rican music -- not annoying, but rather it addced a nice beat to our stay. Surprisingly, this hotel had the only permanent seats on the beach -- otherwise, we had two miles of empty sand and a beautiful sea breeze. Finally, the bar and restaurant were cheerful and cozy; the entire hotel was cozy. One of the very few disappointments we faced is the strong undertow on the beach. I was caught quite quickly, and I had to call on two men running by, and my mom, to pull me out. No one was swimming, most of the time. We did see a kite-surfer giving lessons. What fun! A plus for us, but a minus for some, I'm sure, is the happy quiet atmosphere with no wild games or partying. If you are looking for spring break, don't look here. The hotel staff pointed us in the direction of a small diner, right across the street from the hotel, called Ruben's diner. I never found this on Yelp or any other restaurant search engine, but the food was tasty, the service very friendly, and the cafe con leche a truly decadent treat. We tried other small restaurants around, including another diner and a pizza place, but we just couldn't stay away from Ruben's. It is inexpensive, with a broad menu, a lovely dining-room/bar setup, and the most cheerful staff you could hope for. I will post photos as soon as possible. I will recommend this hotel to everyone I know, with the possible exception of my younger adult, partying friends, and I will be back!

Clearly we are not the first to find that the Beach House is NOTHING like what you see on their website. However, if you're looking for an amazing beach and don't care about where you sleep, you'll love the Beach House. The large day beds on the beach are magnificent and almost make you forget about the room from which you came. The open bar on the ocean is a nice retreat and though we did not eat at the hotel, I heard from almost every other guest how delicious their offerings were. All staff were incredibly friendly and helpful with questions. The issue with the Beach House is that the hotel itself, in terms of accommodations, is extremely outdated. Upon check-in, we were taken to a room on the 2nd level that almost had no room for our luggage, let alone the two of us. It was extremely damp, dreary, claustrophobic and ultimately, unclean. The type of room where you know they do everything they can to make it look nice, but everything is simply so old that you can't attain perfection. Requesting to be moved, the manager was very kind and upgraded us to a separate building after showing me several rooms (a small studio if you will at the front of the property, but directly in the parking lot/entrance) because of the length of our stay. It was a nicer, more open space, but still severely lacking in so many areas. The wireless internet of the hotel did not reach our room, though we were only 10 steps from the front desk. The floors were filthy, the toilet seat almost completely unattached from the porcelain bowl, the shower dial required a compass to find the .5-degree zone at which you could attain hot water. To add insult to injury, there was drilling, hammering, and sawing on the roof of this unit almost all day - perhaps an attempt at much needed renovations, which they should focus on the interior of the rooms themselves. The bed was moderate at best, with old linens and well worn pillows.. Upon waking up after our first night at the Beach House, we had no electricity in our unit which was the final straw. For the price ($135/night) none of this was a major disappointment given the extravagant beach and friendliness of the staff. But for four nights (during which I wanted to spend our days relaxing after great nights of sleep) we just couldn't handle the hassle and decided to leave for a hotel that may be more expensive, but at the very least, is comfortable and clean. They were very kind and credited us for the remaining three nights without a penalty because of all the problems that we had encountered and the fact that the hotel's website is NOT representative whatsoever of what you get at the Beach House.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cNot what it appears to be.....\u201d", "Author": "swimgirlAtlanta", "ReviewID": "UR57938658", "Content": "The photos brought us in..was also recommended by a colleague....however, upon entering our room, it was below a super 6 standard.

As far as Caribbean beaches go, Isla Verde is not spectacular but it's as good as any near San Juan- nicer than the beach along Condado. It's a long sandy beach with quite a bit of kelp in parts- although the beachfront in front of the hotel was very clean and you could swim out a couple hundred yards easily. Our room was tiny, but the staff kept it clean and the DVD player and Ipod dock were nice touches.. and seriously there's no reason to spend extended time in the room since the cabanas outside were always available. The continental breakfast every day was surprisingly good. The restaurant is fine for dinner, nothing special. A warning, this is Puerto Rico so you may find walking in the area around the hotel a little seedy.. Condom World, tattoo shops, liquor stores etc.. but we walked around every night and never felt unsafe. The 15 minute walk up to check out the Ritz Carlton is probably worth it. In the other direction, toward San Juan there's a restaurant called Ceviche House which had a Peruvian-themed menu, great seafood and sangria and seemed popular with the locals. And Barrachina (sp?) bar about a quarter mile west of the hotel makes an amazing Pina Colada. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel that takes you into Old San Juan for $0.75, which is very convenient. Avoid during rush hour though!!

I had a feeling that many of them were written by \u00e2\u20ac\u0153spoiled\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd middle aged American women. Puerto Rico, first and foremost, is a Third world nation. They do not live by the same standards that most middle class Americans live by. So you should be prepared for showers that have little water pressure, and little to no hot water. If you spend any time exploring the island you will see that there are very few places that are \u00e2\u20ac\u0153clean.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd The Beach House I would say is about as good as you get without spending $400 or better per night on a room. The location is central to the airport and the ship yards and is the perfect place to start a car trip as the highways are 30 seconds from the parking lot. Some reviews complain about airport noise, but I guess I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t notice as I live near O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Hare in Chicago, which is a million times worse. We stayed in room 18, the largest room directly over the Night Club. It was a delight to see how big this room was after reading all of the complaints of small rooms. I would say it was about 25x30 with two sitting areas, a small kitchen area with 2 refrigerators, and a large bathroom. Opposite the entry door was a door that walked out to a large private terrace with a table and chairs; where the staff even lit some candles at night for us. That terrace then steps down to another terrace that leads you to the bar area. I can concur that Chris was a hospitable bartender and was happy to take shots with us even though it was raining and very windy. Although I did not meet Sabrina, she was very helpful over the phone when I called to make reservations the week prior to our trip. As for the rest of the staff they were more than pleasant. I would imagine that it would take a terrible, evil and overly needy sort of person to say that the staff is Horrible. Again this is not the RITZ. The restaurant was good although pricey and could have used another page or two in the menu. But I noticed that everything in that area of PR was very over priced! The down side. There were spots of blood on the sheets. There was no hot water and no water pressure. From the street the place looks like a hostel. And the Music was VERY LOUD but the people were LOUDER!! The Dj did stop at exactly 2am. Because I had read so many reviews about the loud music I expected some noise but COME ON. For its location we were willing to overlook anything that most would complain about, it is one of the few places to stay directly on the beach, besides the El San Juan, which has a great pool and whirlpool that you can walk into from the beach. I also suggest walking to the bar at Hotel La Playa, they have an Amazing Hummus plate. So if you are looking for a place on a beautiful beach, don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t require much assistance from staff, are not a neat freak, like to party with locals until 2am, and want to save some money, The Beach House is the place for you!", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "new jersey", "Title": "\u201cNot so bad\u201d", "Author": "cruzinjc", "ReviewID": "UR21486665", "Content": "1) Housekeeping - After reading all the reviews, the first thing we did when we checked in was to check our sheets and sure enough there was hair on the comforter, flat sheet, fitted sheet, and pillow cases. My husband immediately took it all off and went to the front desk and asked for it to be taken careof. We happened to meet Pete while waiting for the front desk to address the issue and explained to him why we were waiting. Pete immediately went upstairs to change our sheets and he even mopped the floor, that looked like it hadn't been cleaned for days. We actually went to Walmart and bought a lightweight comforter and asked that they keep their comforter out of the room. Housekeeping leaves alot to be desired!!! 2) Rooms - Our room was small (no biggie)..no phone, no drawers, a small closet to hang stuff, no refrigerator. We ended up just living right out of our suitcase. Just an fyi if you are a heavy packer. 3) Staff - Pete (works the morning shift and is responsible for the beach area and breakfast)...made our stay worthwhile. He took care of all the guests, no matter what the request. We would go for walks every morning and upon our return Pete awaited us with water and had the beachchairs/umbrella all setup for us. He was amazing. He also provided a list of things for us to do and a list of great restaurants. Sabrina (runs the frontdesk and is one of the managers)...she was accommodating and pleasant to deal with. Our flight wasn't scheduled to depart until late afternoon, she allowed us to extend our stay at no charge so we had a place to wait without having to get stuck at the airport. Chris (ran the bar while we were there)...he was very kind and had great conversations with us. Also gave great suggestions on places to visit. 4) Restaurant - Only ate there once and it was good. However, to our surprise the menu had no Puerto Rican dishes available. We often ate out because of this and the restaurant doesn't open until after 5. It was closed on Monday and Tuesday. For lunch you also have to leave the hotel due to their hours. 5) Bar - Relaxing atmosphere during the day (very chic), however the rock music totally disrupted the atmosphere. When the carribbean or the jazz music was on, it was such a relaxing place to be. The bar was opened Wed - Sun from 12pm on. On Friday and Satuday the bar is open to everyone (guests and what seemed to be all the locals in san juan) and it doesn't close until after 1am and the music is LOUD!! On Sunday we figured we wouldn't have to deal with the massive crowds, we would just relax...NOT the case. There was something going on in the lounge and it was soooo LOUD! a little irritating at times. There is no schedule or information available that warns you...so be AWARE! The bar and restaurant were closed on both Monday and Tuesday (surprised) and so be ready to go out for food and drinks. 6) Room Service - not your typical because none of the rooms have phones. So you go downstairs to the frontdesk (a few feet from the bar/rest) and tell the attendant what you want and they bring it up to you. Hello, if you have to get up and get dressed, you might as well go to the back patio and eat! 7) Parking - The hotel provided parking. However be aware on weekends the place gets packed because of the bar and so if you go out make sure and return by 7ish because the parking gets filled and you will lose your spot. Ridiculous, I know but be warned! 8) Beach area - is absolutely beautiful and in my opinion probably the most enticing within miles. It is available to the locals as well which didn't seem to be a big deal. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. Overall, the stay was a pleasant one. The biggest frustration for us was housekeeping and the late hours at the bar. We probably wouldn't stay here again on our next few visits to San Juan. We actually visited the condo's to the right and left of the hotel and found that we could rent a place for about the same price and have an extra room and a kitchen.

The beds and cabanas outside on the beach are great, as well as beach-side service for drinks/food etc. Hanging out on the cabanas at night is definitely a lot of fun as well. The complimentary breakfast is extremely basic....mini-boxes of cereal, some sad pieces of fruit, and coffe/tea. Not great, but did the job. The restaurant on the beach is decent, and service was fine. The rooms definitely could use a lot of improvement. We spotted a few cockroaches and only had hot water once during our weekend stay. Apparently there were problems/construction at the hotel (or maybe the city too?) The decor makes it seem hip and trendy, but is really just covering up some levels of crustiness. Location was great. We were able to walk to other fancy hotels eat at their restaurants, go to the casinos, etc. Would probably not stay here next time, but would definitely stay at a neighboring hotel and enjoy the day relaxing on their chairs/lounges and eating at the bar. If you are considering this hotel, I think it'd suffice for a really short trip (no more than 3 nights.)

Though our rooms were small, they were clean and comfortable, and despite forewarnings, turned out to be quiet for our two pre-cruise nights. The small, intimate hotel did have the distinct feel of a boutique hotel and had a unique ambiance. The biggest beef among reviewers seemed focused on poor staff service. Forewarned with this information, we went out of our way to test the staff on service at every opportunity. We found all we encountered to be very friendly and accommodative. We would particularly single out Sabrina at the front desk for her concern and responsiveness. Upon check-in we noted that the hotel provided i-pod dock in our room was lacking a power cord. Upon reporting this to Sabrina, she showed up in less than five minutes with a replacement. She was equally prompt in responding to our request for extra hangars for our closet. Other staff assistance was provided regarding rain forest cruise information and directions to other venues in the area. The front desk staff promptly summoned a taxi when requested. We enjoyed two great dinners at the hotel restaurant (Cafe LePlage) which was in the most romantic setting imaginable. We chose tables for both dinners that were actually on the sand beach behind the hotel. We enjoyed friendly out-door bar service prior to dinner. The hotel beach area was illuminated with torches. They have three Asian daybeds on the beach. Their sheer curtains billowed in the pleasant breeze off the sea and caught the reflective light from the torches. It was an absolutely gorgeous setting (click on \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hotel photos\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd at the Trip Advisor review page for the hotel). The food was excellent. Peter and Gretchen rendered excellent and attentive table service. On the Saturday night of our post-cruise stay at the hotel, we did experience the noise we came to expect from reading the reviews. However, we thought it worth it because the source of the noise was a traditional Brazilian wedding that took place at the hotel on the aforementioned beach. The festivities included about a 45 minute non-stop performance by a drum corps (apparently a Brazilian wedding custom), which we enjoyed very much. Our second dinner on the beach was actually within feet of the ceremony and subsequent \"reception\". We almost felt like wedding guests, though we abandoned the party early as it went on on until at least 3:00 am. To deal with the noise, we simply turned on our i-pod in our room to great effect in muffling the noise. We requested a late check-out on our departure date because of our late afternoon flight and were graciously accommodated. We spent some more time on the beach. Again, a request for beach towels was responded to promptly. The only inconvenience we experienced was a near complete water shutoff on our last morning at the hotel. Upon inquiring, we were told that the city was working on water supply lines and that the hotel had no control over it. Understood, but notice of such could and should have been provided as a courtesy to guests. Otherwise, we suspect that most of the problems experienced by others may have been attitude problems of their own rather than that of the staff.

The convenient location just ten minute drive from the airport and right on a very nice stretch of beach has let this hotel get away with the huge flaws the management doesn't seem to want to do anything about. A former 50's motel with tiny rooms, it's been tidied up and freshened with simple cosmetics. The rooms, though tiny, were clean enough, but the windows were hermetically sealed, and the very loud air conditioning competed with the non stop blaring noise from the on site disco which made sleeping a challenge, even on a Sunday night. The biggest shortcoming at the Beach House Hotel is the poor quality of service by the staff who, though pleasant, were either clueless, disorganized, or incompetent, and needed training, guidance or replacement. The following are just a few examples: We sat for nearly an hour at the outdoor restaurant trying to get someone to take our order, and when we tried to use the one-free-drink-coupons we received at check-in, were told it applied to only one wine selection and one beer selection...no special drinks like pina colada or daquiri. Our salads arrived without dressing and we still had no forks, knives or napkins. It took so long to get utensils we started to eat the salad with our fingers. There weren't very many patrons in the restaurant, but the one table that was receiving a lot of attention was where the owner and his family were eating. The owner got up to do things a number of times but never noticed we were not being attended to. Finally our utensils arrived and we ordered the saffron colored seafood paella which we saw at the owner's table and made a point of telling our waiter we wanted exactly that paella (because the week before we had ordered the seafood paella and after a very long wait had been served a mixed paella with bits of sausage and meat instead...we were so hungry we ate it anyway). We had been seated for almost two hours when we were served our seafood paella which was not like the owner's at all. No golden saffron colored rice like what he was eating... instead meager pieces of fish and seafood in a bed of overly salted, greasy rice, a disappointment which we expressed to the waiter who shrugged his shoulders and said it wasn't his fault. Again, we were hungry and ate it anyway. Only one of the desserts on the menu was available and no coffee because the coffee machine was broken. We actually wondered if we were on a candid camera show because we were being so poorly served and treated, we thought it couldn't be for real...but it was! At breakfast (which was included in the price of the room), there was coffee (different coffee maker?) but no milk for the cold cereal or coffee, and the fruit was so far past its prime it was moments away from rotten. The waiter was pleasant but said sorry we're out of milk. There's a 7eleven across the street, why would they be out of milk? At breakfast during our previous stay the week before, the strawberries, pineapple, and cantaloupe were rotting ripe, but the grapes were good, but this week there were no grapes...and no milk. This hotel/restaurant experience was unnecessarily bad and not worth the price we paid.

We were supposed to stay with relatives but plans changed and decided to find a hotel for our last days in PR. Everything available at that point was over $350 at the Marriot, the Condado Plaza, the El San Juan and even at the smaller hotels the prices were outrageous. After reading a few reviews of this hotel we decided to give it a try. 1. Location - Right on the beach. Perfect! 2. Rates - I called the hotel directly and was offered a room for $185 per night including taxes, fees and daily breakfast. I saw previous posts complaining about the taxes and fees. These are imposed by the government of Puerto Rico and not by this hotel in particular. Actually, every hotel in Puerto Rico charges the same percentage of taxes and resort fees, etc. We have paid similar or higher taxes and fees in other Caribbean islands like Dominican Republic and Turks & Caicos. 3. Check in - Quick and simple. The front desk girl was very friendly and attentive. 4. Noise complaints - The front desk girl and a maid voiced their concerns of having our child being bothered by the noise (there was a private party a few steps from our room on the terrace). She assured us that the party will be over early in the evening. The party was over at about 7:00 pm. Afterwards, we did hear music from the bar but not late at night. I am a very light sleeper and didn't wake up at all from any noise. We had the air conditioner running and maybe this helped the noise factor. Perhaps there is more noise on the other side near the Lounge. I think the management should address this issue because I don't think anyone want to stay in a hotel with music blasting all night. 5. Room - Clean and decent sized. We were on #12 which is on the second floor in the corner above the bar area. We had enough space for our suitcases, a playpen and a stroller. We had two double beds which were very comfortable. There was a TV with cable with lots of channels and a Ihome Clock Radio system for Ipod. We didn't have any problems with the bathroom or water pressure or water temperature. 6. Bar, Lounge and Restaurant - Right away, we had our complimentary cocktails (mojitos) which were the best we had in a long time. On our last night I stopped by the lounge and as suggested by the bartender (I think his name was Carlos) got a pitcher of mojitos to take to our room. The lounge was beautiful and would've have definitely enjoyed it in our \"single\" days. We had also the free breakfast. Basic but sufficient to hold us until our next meal. 7. The staff at the bar, the beach attendants, front desk attendants and maids offered excellent service at all times. This is a small hotel and it doesn't offer a lot of amenities like the big hotels but it was perfect for us. Room service, casinos, big restaurants, are not on our list of necessities so we were pretty happy with The Beach House Hotel. I also found the environment of the hotel to be family friendly.
