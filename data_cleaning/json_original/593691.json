{"Reviews": [{"Content": "A hidden gem Hotel Adele is located in the Prenzlauer Berg quarter of Berlin, a few tram stops from Alexanderplatz. The area is a mix of (partly renovated) GDR style highrise buildings and older and newer city blocks. The surrounding looks a bit unpromising to the untrained eye, but the hotel on the inside, once you actually did get in due to the somewhat bohemian working hours, is exceptionally nice - highest quality modern designer furniture and bathrooms, spotlessly clean.The restaurant looks OK (we did not try it), the breakfast was good but nothing to write home about. Staff was very friendly.The hotel is small (only 10 rooms) and well kept.", "Date": "Jan 10, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR154168608", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Jan_42"}, {"Content": "great hotel, would definitely go back we booked a room at \u9227?50 a night but all rooms at that rate were full so we were upgraded to a suite which was lovely, own entrance onto the street, its boutique style spotlessly clean and very comfortable, did notice a slight chill on the first evening but fine after that, the restaurant was separate to the hotel and is open to the public, breakfast is good, staff were lovely, discreet but very helpful. its on a tram line which takes you two stops to the sbahn greifswalder strasse stop, would highly recommend hiring bikes and this a perfect location to get around the city from, about 15mins cycle to alexanderplatz, there are'nt many bars restaurants around it so we travelled to mitte or further in to prenz berg in the eve for food which was fine, free internet and printing which was great for getting local maps, would definitely return all in all a great stay", "Date": "May 8, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR608784832", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "Adele_Kane"}, {"Content": "nice little hotel located at prenzlauer berg one of the view nice and not expensive hotel almost in the central area of prenzlauer berg. 5 to 10 minutes walk to kollwitzer or helmholtz platz. good restaurant. try to get a room that is not towards greifswalder strasse which is a bit loud.", "Date": "Nov 2, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR593385738", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "making99"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d593691-r12499148-Adele_Hotel-Berlin.html", "HotelID": "593691", "Price": "$217"}}
