This was our first trip to Rome and we chose the hotel on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews; and were very glad we did. The Lunetta is a small hotel, perfectly located for most of the major sites, in a quiet piazza just off the Campo de Fiori; and is within a 20 minute walk of the Coloseum, Spanish steps and Vatican City. The standard of decor and fittings was high, although at the time of our visit the spa had not yet opened. This wasn\u2019t of concern to us, although I would imagine that a quick dip in the pool would be welcome at the end of a long day sightseeing if visiting Rome during the summer months. We stayed in one of the standard rooms which, although not huge, was more than adequate by European standards. The room and en-suite were, like the rest of the hotel, tastefully decorated and immaculately clean. The only down-side was a rather uninspiring view from our window into a closed courtyard \u2013 but otherwise no complaints. At the top of the hotel there\u2019s a small roof-terrace \u2013 we took a drink up with us to enjoy the last of the early evening sun prior to going out to dinner. Breakfast is provided in 2 rooms next to reception, and offered a good selection of both continental and cooked food. There\u2019s a very good restaurant immediately next door to the hotel \u2013 the \u201cHostaria Costanza\u201d, which, like the hotel, is built into the remains of the original walls of the Teatro Pompeo. It\u2019s well worth a visit \u2013 good quality unpretentious local fare. We e-mailed the hotel in advance of our stay and they booked us a table for our first night (as well as private transfers to and from the airport). The reception staff at the Lunetta were professional, helpful and courteous throughout. A couple of other things: 1) October turned out to be an ideal month to visit Rome \u2013 temperatures still very warm (mid 20\u2019s C during the day), without being uncomfortable. 2) We had read quite a few scare stories about pickpockets before we went \u2013 but to be honest, felt just as safe as we have in any other major European city. I think it\u2019s just a case of being aware and taking sensible precautions. We spent a packed 4 days in Rome \u2013 absolutely loved the city \u2013 and the Lunetta was a wonderful base to return to after a day slogging the streets.

(and again, flawlessly clean). Additional toiletries were provided and were very nice quality. The size of the room didn't bother us, since we weren't planning on spending much time there. Best part was the location. Absolutely gorgeous part of Rome for visitors. It's on a side street but our cab driver knew exactly where it was. I wouldn't recommend hanging out or eating in Campo de fiori (that really is too touristy), but the surrounding streets and neighborhoods are wonderful. Very easy walk to piazza navona, pantheon, Jewish ghetto, shopping. Vatican is a little farther- we took a cab because we were running late and it was less than 5 minute drive. I have no cons to report. This is a boutique hotel- not a big US chain, so some amenities like 24 hour room service are not available.

We had a very stressful ride from the airport with a very objectionable taxi driver and it was a huge relief to come into the oasis of calm of the Lunetta reception. The likes: - reception and breakfast staff were all friendly and informative, - stylish decor - cleaniness - all was spick and span - nice linens and towels - lovely bathroom with great shower (good pressure/ plenty hot water) - very quiet, our room was at the front but when the window was closed you heard nothing - the window overlooking the little piazza to the front of the hotel and windowseat - though small the bed had a good quality mattress and was comfortable - decent buffet breakfast - location, probabaly can't be bettered, you can walk everywhere The not so goods: - the bedroom was tiny. I can't remember which number room we had but it was on the first floor at the front, looking over the piazza (on the left as you face the hotel). The bed was a small double but looked and felt smaller as the large pillows had to be arranged as for a single bed rather than a double. There was only about a foot on one side (next to the cupboards) and only about 2 foot max on the other. We took it in turns to move around the room - it was almost impossible to both be moving at the same time - one of the cupboards had no bar to hang clothes from rendering it almost useless for storing anything but bags and shoes - some of the bathroom fittings were coming loose We didn't really test out the internet or the TV (didn't seem to be an English channel). I suppose we could have made a fuss about the room and asked to be moved but for the four days we were there it was fine. All the essentials were good and it was very pleasant for the minimal time we spent in it awake. The little window seat hidden behind the curtain also provided a quiet private space for reading/chilling - a boon and unbelievable in such a small room. Final Tips: Try the restaurant next door (I can't remember its name but go out of Lunetta and it is first on the right). We were recommended it by Lunetta reception on the first night when we wanted somewhere close. We were a bit sceptical but went anyway and had the best overall restaurant experience we had in Rome.

No, but service and quality they provide makes up more than cost. After all, we were in Rome near most notable Campo de' Fiori. Sleep Quality - Bed was near king size if not king size bed. Only problem is we are used to sleep in softer beds. linens used were very nice. we also had similar hardness(?) of beds in other parts of Italy, and in Japan as well, so it's probably what my body is used to at my own house. Rooms - It was very nice and well decorated. only thing I am going to mention is one of the base board will need repair (nail back into wall/ or glue to wall, I think) That's it, very minor. Restaurant - Not exactly restaurant since they only serves breakfast. But Breakfast was great in the category of service (prompt), food selection and quality of food.

I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before deciding to book the hotel even though there was not a lot of information available at the time of booking . The hotel as others have mentioned has just recently reopened after extensive renovations from top to bottom.The renovations and finishes are high quality and the pictures on the hotel website are quite accurate . At the time of our stay in October the spa was still not open . For us the best thing about Hotel Lunetta is it's location , on Piazza del Paradiso which is very quiet and next to Campo de Fiori and a short walk to Piazza Navona . While the area in front of the hotel is quiet both Campo de Fiori and Piazza Navona are alive with activity day and night . This is such a beatiful historic part of Rome with cafes, bars,restaurants everywhere . The hotel is located very central so that most of the major tourist sites are within an easy 15-20 walk . During our week in Rome we were able to walk everywhere from the hotel and never needed to take a taxi or bus . Checkin/out went very smooth and all the front desk staff was very kind and helpful speaking english was never an issue . The staff were always happy to book tours or print off vouchers for our tours when needed . We had a room with a small window that faced the Piazza del Paradiso , the windows must be extremely thick as we heard next to no street noise . The classic double room was a bit smaller than we were expecting ,fully aware hotel rooms in Europe are small . It was a very comfortable room with a mini bar and free wi-fi . The room did not have a coffee maker or a clock which would have been nice . The wi-fi worked with no major connection problems and the fact it was free was a bonus . The bathroom was extremely spacious and very well equipped with everything including a rain shower . For us we found the room lacked storage space such as a dresser,since we stayed 7 days we really wanted to unpack our clothes and put our suitcases away . Not a deal breaker but we had to stack our luaggage on the floor in a corner as we had no bench or luggage rack to sit them . Overall even though the room was small it was very comfortable and suited our needs just fine . The two small breakfast rooms have large windows that look out over the piazza and are very pleasant to eat breakfast in.Breakfast included all the basics and there was always plenty of food and the service was very good . My one big complaint does have to with breakfast and nothing to do with the quality of food or service . Nothing changed !! While i realize the choices for breakfast are limited the food was exactly the same,day after day nothing changed right down to the scrambled eggs and bacon ! By day seven I couldn't even look at the scrambled eggs and bacon let alone eat them ! NOTE TO HOTEL LUNETTA Please change some of your breakfast items from time to time. While our stay at Hotel Lunetta was very nice and the location is near perfection there are a couple of observations that we made . On the internet and hotel website the classic double room rates vary a lot , I have seen the room go from EUR 189/379 USD 268/537 and higher . We were lucky I guess and averaged around USD 300 night and when you check out they collect a hotel tax of EUR 3 per person / per night . This is only our opinion but this room is not worth USD 400/500 night for what you get , if you end up paying over USD 400 night for a classic double room I think you will be disappointed . Our other observation was when we were checking out and asked about a taxi to the airport and were quoted EUR 45 but when we crossed the street to the taxi stand the rate is EUR 40 and is posted inside the taxi .Not sure why a higher rate at the hotel ? This is a great hotel in a great location and if you can book it for a reasonable rate do yourself a favour and stay here , you won't regret it . If you are a first time visitor to Rome as we were don't miss Trastevere and Galleria Borghese.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "London, Ontario, Canada", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location, well appointed rooms, very good service\u201d", "Author": "BSG100", "ReviewID": "UR119624494", "Content": "We booked this hotel several months ago.

As such, it is updated, modern, and clean. It also means that there are a lot of kinks that need to be worked out, specifically with regard to customer service. To summarize the positive: As mentioned above,t he hotel was clean, modern, and comfortable. Additionally, the breakfast was fabulous and they were able to accomodate a gluten-free diet (required because of Celiac disease). The negative: The room was TINY! It was the smallest room that we had in our entire European excursion. Our main complaint was the customer service. We had a car (bad decision) that we were driving throughout Italy. They told us to park in a certain location but didn't help with any specifics...they didn't tell us we needed coins, what spots were okay to park in, etc. This was despite asking several times. Long story short, we got towed. When we asked for help in locating our car, they were extremely unhelpful and defensive. I don't know if part of the defensiveness is cultural (this was noticed throughout our experiences Italy) but rather than helping they were blaming. We wanted to solve the problem and get our car back (we were in problem solving mode) and they wanted to blame us rather than helping. The manager was also intent on blaming rather than problem solving. We would definitely return to Rome. Would we stay at Hotel Lunetta again? Likely not...at least not until they get completely on their feet.

And: rooms are quiet, but in the top you find room 401 and 402. They are connected by a door and closets and therefore you hear every noise from your neighbour. 402 is very small, there is no fixed bed but a sleeping coach, no desk to do your work. It is rented out though as a complete room for a complete price. You do not have space there at all, the only plus for that room is the private roofterrace.

The hotel is hidden away in a quiet quaint little square, right in the heart of the city, ideal for being in walking distance to all the main attractions, good bars and restaurants.
