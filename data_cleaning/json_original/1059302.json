It is definitely a business hotel with crisp and attentive businesslike service, mostly in English. Rooms are an excellent size, tastefully decorated with everything you need and above all a great bed. The breakfast service was excellent, especially in its variety in dishes. It's a joy to spend some time in this breakfast room. But that's nothing compared to the restaurant on the top floor. Great views, especially from terrace (where you can eat too) and great dishes. As this hotel is on the Asian side of Istanbul (and some distance away) it is not exactly ideal for sightseeing in Istanbul.

Warm welcome at reception with excellent English being spoken by almost every member of staff throughout the hotel. The room was appointed to an excellent standard, high quality furnishings, contemporary styling and plenty of room. Very comfortable beds and air conditioning that could be on all night and still sleep. Free WIFI in the rooms helped with keeping mobile phone costs down by using email rather than text or phone back home. The main restaurant served good quality food on a serve yourself buffet basis that I found to offer a wide range of dishes to cater for different tastes and cultures. Plenty of vegetarian, healthy and meat options, but I would have liked to have had some better descriptions so that I knew what everything was - but this was more my ignorance of Turkish cuisine than a fault of the hotel. The pool was excellent, and a terrific way to relax after a long day in the office and the roof top bar is highly recommended. The only downside was the location does not really allow for any sightseeing if you are a tourist (but it is called the Business Hotel for a reason) as there is nothing to see in the local area other than apartment blocks and businesses. I took a trip over to the European side to see the blue Mosque and other sights via taxi and ferry, but this proved to be quite expensive.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "bangalore", "Title": "\u201cTitanic_Turkey\u201d", "Author": "arkharul", "ReviewID": "UR109298477", "Content": "Good economy hotel.

The ingredients seemed fine, but the manner of their cooking ruined them. The Risotto was the worst i have ever tasted, but I consumed it out of desperation with no ill effects.....

As soon as I arrived, I noticed how nice the staff are: friendly, helpful and always with a smile. This is a very important first impression.

The bath room is separated by a glass door from the sink, and it it combined with a separate shower. It is an experience to shower in that room, you have to try it in order to understand what I am talking about\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The bed was extremely comfortable, and the entire design of the hotel and room is modern and very up to date. Other key features: -Free wifi is offered throughout the hotel. -Very good breakfast. -Huge gym \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not the regular tiny gyms that hotels usually have.

Not much to do in that area, there is a small downtown about 500 meters away from the hotel and there is also a mall with a big supermarket and fast food.
