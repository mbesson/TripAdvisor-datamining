Staff was amazing, friendly, and extremely helpful from the desk to the bar to wait staff and hostess. We were up late most nights so the nightly music and bar crowd was not a problem, but if you go to bed before midnight, be aware of this, the place is hopping around the bar area. The drag show was great, don't miss it. If you have a car, be careful to park on a side street that isn't restricted parking. Note, the island is populated by roosters that like to crow at night, but this is an equal opportunity noise everywhere except perhaps at the big hotels in the waterfront areas. Easy walk to everywhere up and down Duval, this is the less busy end. I wouldn't recommend planning any pool time at least during the cool months; the pool is in a pocket in the center of the property and won't get a great deal of sun and is next to the dining area.

We had dined here earlier in the year and so we were fairly familiar with the place. Service is warm and friendly whether at reception, the bar or in the restaurant. We were booked in to change rooms halfway through our stay (as planned - we were late-ish bookers) and the transfer was seamlessly managed with a smile. On change-over day, our heavy bags were there in our new room when we returned later in the afternoon. Breakfast is included in the price and is very good with three options plus fruit juice and coffee or tea. I would say that perhaps apart from offering the comp residents' menu, the hotel may be well served to show residents what else they can offer from the main breakfast menu. They would undoubtedly take a few more dollars if they did this. Service at breakfast was excellent and because of the length of our stay we soon got on very well with the waiters - all great guys. The rooms were comfortable. We stayed in a de luxe and then a luxury for the second half of our stay. To be completely honest, they both needed a little TLC here and there; minor 1 hour maintenance jobs. There had been a roof leak at some point in the past in our de luxe room and the paintwork stains had not been attended to. Also, the Jacuzzi bath tap was very impossible to turn so we made do with showers (which was fine for us). On the cleanliness front the ceiling fan blades could have done with regular cleaning. These were minor in the whole scheme of things but worthy of note all the same but also they should be easy enough to remedy so that they are not noted by guests in the future. The pool area was a nice place to chill out in the afternoon where the sunshine danced through the shade of the poolside palm trees. It has a truly charming feel - wooden decks and white painted balustrades everywhere around the pool - they must need a lot of maintenance - some areas more than others it has to be said. This after all is not a 7 star luxury resort with artificial perfection, painted smiles and corporate-style meets and greets. The staff made us feel very comfortable and at home here. Would we return here? We wouldn't say no but then we would probably want to try somewhere else just for the sake of trying somewhere else and not because we didn't enjoy our stay here (because we did).

It must have been kismet because they had availability and it was truly wonderful! Now, if you are looking for a five star, all inclusive resort, this really isn't your type of place. However, if you are looking for something very low key and laid back, you've found it. We got to stay in two different rooms. Both were very nice, unique and clean. (Cleaning staff are totally on the ball!) Breakfast is included and it was just heavenly. I heard from everyone that you must go to Blue Heaven for breakfast. We had full intentions to visit it, but...the breakfast was so fantastic AND INCLUDED that I hated to pass it up. If I got up earlier, perhaps I could have eaten at both! It also has a lovely pool, which is shaded and cool on hot afternoons as well as a clothing optional sun deck that is very private. The only (slightly) negative is that parking is a bit of an issue. There's no designated parking and street parking is very hard to obtain. So here is how we dealt with it. We turned in our car the day after we got there and we never missed it! You don't really need one anyway. Even though La Te Da is on the far end (and the best at that) it's not that far to walk to the more touristy part of Key West. Speaking of, it is a lot more quiet there. But that doesn't mean it isn't A LOT OF FUN, because it is! From the drag show (which is a must), to Tea Dance on Sunday afternoon, as well as Dave Bootle on Thursday and Saturdays, it's almost hard to go anywhere else. If you don't enjoy yourself at the La Te Da, you might want to check for a pulse! Now I've mentioned a lot of great things but the absolute best part of La Te Da is hands down, the staff! From Eric, Chris and Christina at the front desk, to all of the wonderful kitchen,wait and housekeeping staff (like Cheryl). As well as the stellar bar staff! Mindy, Doug and the best bartender ever, Derek! We love them all! They treat you great but once they know you are staying there, you're treated like royalty!

The rooms are a bit dated but still quite nice, except for one major problem, but I'll get to that. The restaurant and bar have a great vibe with awesome food and a super-friendly staff. Be sure to check them out when you're in town! Daily breakfast at the restaurant was included with my room - what a great treat! Now for the bad part: TERMITES! I'm quite accustomed to small ants, spiders, gnats, etc in south Florida - no big deal. It's quite another thing though to wake up with piles of termite and their recently shed wings covering the white-tiled bathroom floor every morning. I mentioned it at the desk but was told that termites are unavoidable in the keys. I have never experienced them anywhere else in the world, much less on prior trips to Key West. The maid did her best to sweep them away daily but more quickly returned within a couple of hours. It's very disconcerting to get up in the morning and find termites on the drapes, room divider curtains, towels, bathmat, bedroom and bathroom floor. They even got into my bathroom shaving kit. Egads! It was like a Hitchcock movie! I'm not sure if this is a seasonal clustering or if it's this way all the time, but it really ruined the enjoyment of my stay. I was so pre-occupied with worrying about bringing them home to eat my house that I found relaxation at the hotel a bit difficult. Chunks of the hardwood floor the size of a quarter are missing where the little critters have eaten the underlying wood. I just can't believe that when termites are this obvious and this destructive that the folks at La Te Da haven't found a way to control them.

But it had adequate counter space for 3 ladies hair products makeup etc, the room itself was kept very clean by the housekeeping staff, had a nice deck outside that overlooked the pool, it was just very nice overall (we stayed in one of the \"luxury\" rooms). Only complaint for the room was that there was no iron (with my horrible packing, I only had a few clothes to wear that weren't completely wrinkled!), however my guess is that if we asked the front desk, they probably would have provided one (we just didn't bother). The hotel itself is really cute - you have two bars - one is outside which is really nice, there is a restaurant, a theater, a pool, and the location is perfect. It was really nice being on the \"quieter\" side of Duval - the pier end is kind of a madhouse (and the hotel is only a 2 minute cab ride or 10 minute walk from there anyways) so it was nice to come back to a relaxed atmosphere. The bartenders are really nice and fun at the hotel, the guy who checked us is was really nice (helped me get my extremely heavy overpacked bag up the steps to the room!) and the hotel has a \"gay tea party\" on Sundays which was a lot of fun and A LOT of people were there!

We stayed from Memorial Day (May 25th) through May 29th. This is the quiet season in Key West. There were only about 4 to 5 other couples staying at the house with us. Room We stayed in Room 27, which faces out to the pool on the first floor. It is nicely furnished and the room was clean. If you are one to look at details (like I am), there are things that need upkeep. For example, there was a gap at the top of our room door. And with the mosquitoes all around Key West, you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to give them access to your room. The room could use a paint job. Pool One of the previous reviews were dead on- there is cat hair ALL OVER the pool lounge chairs. There are two cats that live at the guesthouse and meander about the pool, restaurant and kitchen areas. If you get Room 27, you have two Adirondack chairs on your mini patio so you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to use the lounge chairs. There is also a sundeck at the top of the house, which is clothing optional and has chairs without cat hair. Bar & Restaurant The room rate includes daily breakfast, which is served from 8:30am-10:30am. There are three breakfast options, and includes coffee and juice. The options are good starters for the day. We had dinner there one evening, which was very good. Portions aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t big for the prices, but full of flavor. The bar faces Duval, so it is great for people watching. The bartenders are friendly and the bar atmosphere is fun. Location Like other reviewers have said, it is on the quiet end of Duval. If you are a walker (like my husband and I are), you will have no problem getting from one end of Duval to the other. Recommendations -Check out the Ernest Hemingway House (best house to tour in Key West). -Check out Shipwreck Museum (for interesting Key West history). -Go to Dante\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s on Caroline Street- half price raw bar from 4-8pm. -Go see the sunset at Top Bar (on rooftop) at the Crown Plaza on Duval. -Make the effort to walk down to the marina- a bunch of untouched restaurants.", "Date": "May 30, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Portland, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cTropical Rooms\u201d", "Author": "Brunswick1977", "ReviewID": "UR26669785", "Content": "Stayed here for our wedding.

The outdoor lights to the room were also u/s as were the lights up the steps to the room. We weere plagued with mosquitos in the room, killing about 20-30 each day & left covered in bites.

The kitchen doors are wide open all day with no fly screen in place. Pool towel service was erratic, somedays we got 3 towels, other days only 1. Hot water for showers was random too, we had to have several cold showers. The pool was difficult to use as the shallow end steps are roped off as it borders the restaurant. Access is via very sharp steep steps straight into the deep end & the pool floor is all flakey & needs repairing. The clothing option sundeck is via a rickety rusty staircase, where you find the most uninviting sun terrace I have ever seen. La Te Da tries to be a Bar, Restaurant & a hotel, but whilst the bars are pretty good places to go, the hotel part falls well short of acceptable standards. I would not recommend this place as a good place to stay. We were throughly disappointed, many of the issues were raised with hotel reception, but nothing was done about any of them.

Those dressed up for dinner mix well with those in flip-flops that haven't gotten off their bar-stools since breakfast. The cabaret is one of the island's crown jewels. Just campy enough to make it fun. Lots of fun! The hotel has two bars - The outdoor bar is a great place for people watching and enjoying the best Mimosa you'll ever have. I've stayed at several hotels on Key West, and now that I've found La Te Da, I'll never have to look again. -David", "Date": "September 19, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "3", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Langhorne, Pa", "Title": "\u201cI'm Hooked\u201d", "Author": "RNKR", "ReviewID": "UR8349990", "Content": "I agree with all the positive reviews.

We really enjoyed the location of the hotel on the quiet end of Duval St. with boutique shops and art galleries right across the street. The staff was very friendly throughout our stay from the moment we arrived. Our room was a standard king room which was at the back of the property on the second level. I would definitely want to stay in a second level room as it seemed more private than the rooms surrounding the pool. The room was large and clean with basic furnishings. I believe some of the more expensive rooms had better furniture and we may try one of those next time, but for this trip it was fine. The one thing that really needed updating was the bathroom. In some pictures on here it seemed the bathroom had been renovated, but not in ours. It reminded us of a public bathroom. Also, there is no central air, but the window A/C worked fine although it was loud. The pool and courtyard of the property is very nice, and though we didn't use the pool this time, at most times we could have had the pool to ourselves. The breakfast, although limited in choices, was good and if we had stayed longer would have probably gone to the restaurant for dinner. Even though the room could use updating, we will probably stay at the La Te Da again on our next visit to Key West.

What we can offer from our stay is nothing short of fantastic. As ALL places in an island resort area, of course they could use a little updating, but as many people have already said, who goes there to spend every minute in the room? The important thing is that the rooms were spotless, and if you needed anything the staff was more than accommodating to make sure you received it. Mark has done an excellent job of finding and retaining some of the best staff that Key West has to offer. Every single person there was friendly and outgoing. The pool does have a little debris from the tree's above, there were people on hand several times a day to remove the leaves, but impossible to manage full time. The pool is private, and is 24 hours. It is heated and feels great at 2 am! We had breakfast and dinner at La Te Da. For breakfast we tried the free meals, which were great. But we also tried the breakfast special one morning, which was delicious. The dinner setting was romantic and the food was prepared perfectly. We ordered specials as well as from the menu (There were 6 of us). Everyone loved his or her food. Our waiter even went the extra mile to accommodate a drink my wife loves. They didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have all of the ingredients on hand, but he made sure she received it. We probably had the most fun with the bar staff. We started our afternoons with drinks at the bar. The bartender was extremely funny/friendly, and made great drinks too! We were told that their Bloody Marys are all home made, but we never had a chance to try one. The La Te Da Lemonade is a great summer drink, and the martini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s come with a very generous \u00e2\u20ac\u0153side-car\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd all of which make for the perfect start of a day. The only negative that we could say about this place is that walking from the hotel to the bars at the other side of the island does get a bit tiring. This problem could be solved by just drinking there, taking a cab, or scooters downtown etc. We would no doubt only stay at La Te Da the next time we visit Key West.

Our stay was over the weekend of the 12th through the 15th of Janruary of 2007. I decided to book this hotel after reading some of the reviews both on here and on the hotel's web site and then after talking to one of the night managers and hearing professionalism and warmth in his voice instantly, it was a no brainer to choose this place. The website also has a very cool video presentation that showcased the property and everything on the video was true to life the minute we jumped out of the car and walked up Duval and into the hotel to check in. I cant begin to tell you how this hotel affected our vacation down there. We originally had booked for two nights (a friday and saturday) and decided to stay through sunday instead of driving back to Miami. The hotel has 15 rooms and though we only stayed in one and our friend in another...if all the rooms were half as nice as ours...I cant imagine anyone not having as wonderful a time as we did. The hotel manager (Danial) was nothing short of amazing in his friendliness and hospitality and in his professionalism. He was always willing to help us with whatever we might have needed (and I am told I am very high maintance to begin so I am sure i was not the easiest guest to take care of) and without missing a beat. That kind of experience went on with the entire staff from beginning to end. The hotel also has a wonderful little restaurant that sits open air overlooking the pool and the many porches and terraces that make up the complex. The tables are dressed in white linen and nice china and stemware and there is a centerpiece of fresh pink roses in glass vases on each table. It is a true courtyard enviroment and the restaurant lends itself to an \"old world bistro\" type feel that is so authentic and relaxing that one could sit there for hours. There is a bar, which is also open air and is situated right next to the street and flows into the restaurant. It has caberet tables as well as a few stools for those who want to sit at the bar. There is also an indoor lounge with a piano that gets some decent traffic at night. The restaurant staff (Jimmie, our server all three mornings and Juan the service assistant in particular) was all top notch and gave us the most personalised and efficient service I have ever recieved anywhere ever, and 500 % more than we had recieved during our whole time in Florida. The breakfasts, which were included with the stay,(the hotel gives you a voucher every morning with different selections to choose from) were very tasty and filling (a french toast to die for on one day and eggs and bacon with toast on the others) and included coffee and juice and everything was perfectly prepared each time. I needed coffee to take up to our room on both mornings before coming down to breakfast, and our favorite server Jimmie set up a tray with cups and coffee and cream on the spot...I was wowed to say the least. I wanted to take her back home to work for me in my restaurant. We didn't eat dinner there but during our stay I noticed many people dining and I talked to one lady and she commented on how tasty everything was. The menu seemed to offer a little bit of everything. I had the pleasure of meeting the chef one morning and I complimented her on her food and professional craftmanship with the menu. The bartenders were always friendly and always had a story or two to tell, along with the best bloody marys in town and were always right on the ball. One in particular, Jason, was a \"quintesential armchair psycitarist\" and always had his ear ready to be bent by anyone wanting to unload their problems on him....which it seemed a few did. While we didnt get a chance to take in any of the caberet shows while we were there, I did notice quite a few people coming in off the street for the classy entertainment eminating from the lounge. The voices of the singer and the guy on the piano accompyning her made for a very \"drawn in\" experience...you could see the people walking in off the street just because of the vibe that was being heard just inside the hotel. During our stay we frequently commented on how nice it was to be on Duval street which is where all the shops and the nightlife are. The hotel is located is towards the southernmost end, which is a bit away from all the traffic and most of the shops and that made it peacefull and quiet but at the same time a very easy walk to all the shopping, food and nightlife. It was almost as if the hotel was a little hideaway from the rest of the hustle and bustle of that famous street. The hotel is also only a few blocks from some very nice beaches and beachside pools that are parts of other complexes at the end of Duval street. At most of those resorts, one can rent a chair on the beach or by the hotel for $6.00 a day. A few have clothing optional areas if one if up for that as well. Our room was wonderful as well. Just perfect. Fresh and clean and what some would probably consider a little dated but just right. It had a true \"Banana Republic feel\" to it. We had a luxery room with a king size bed on the second floor towards the back of the hotel, overlooking the pool. Two sets of french doors and windows both in the room and the bathroom brought in the perfect amount of light and being on the 2nd floor in back, just up the stairs from the pool deck made us feel both secluded and part of the action at the same time. The bed was very comfy with an overstuffed mattress and though we didnt sleep much, we did manage to take quite a few power naps here and there. The room was nicely appointed with a big closet and dresser and tv with mutliple selections available. The bathroom had a nice size jacuzzi, which doubles as the shower (with floor to ceiling mirrors on the wall of the tub) and a decent sized dressing area by the sink. We also had a resident cat named Henry who snoozed on the porch in front of our room or on one of the wicker chairs just in front of the other room that shared our porch....and that alone was an at home feeling one doesnt get a chance to experience that often. The (clothing optional) sundeck on the roof was a perfect place for a lazy morning of sun and reading and so private but yet open. You can see all the way to the southernmost point of the island from the roof and watch people coming and going up and down Duval street at all hours of the day. I could have spent an entire month of sunny days up there. Everyone remembered our names from the get go and that alone made us feel so welcome and at home that we didn't want to leave (sort of like the old Cheer's song...where everyone knows your name) and talked about our stay the entire trip back from the Keys to Wisconsin. We will surly stay at the La Te Da again when down in Key West and will reccomend it to our friends and others without the least bit of hesitation. If anyone wants to experience the true feeling of what Key West used to be and still should be then they should spend a few days at the La Te Da. These folks know how to do hospitality right.

So far, the La-te-da is our favorite hotel. I believe it is named after a Cuban politician. It has wonderful Key West ambiance and \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcpeople watching\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from the bar is splendid. THE GOOD: Great atmosphere, large, clean room, fabulous staff and excellent location. The music they played in the lounge was terrific and comprised light jazz and stuff from the 20\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 30\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and 40\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s. We loved it. It was quite refreshing from the pounding volume of the other drinking establishments farther up the street. A continental breakfast is available and if you want to spend all morning drinking free coffee, the staff will be happy to chat as little or as much as you like. WiFi is no charge and is available in the bar/breakfast area. Just get the password from the front desk and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on-line in no time. As traveling adults we found the lack of kids at the hotel wonderful! The pool is open 24 hours and has some great water toys for guest use. They phoned us a few days in advance to see when we wanted the air turned on in our room -- very thoughtful. THE NEUTAL: There is no off-street parking although parking can be found on side streets near the hotel. Noise from the bar was not an issue for us although light sleepers may have a problem with it. If an iron and ironing board is required, call housekeeping. They will bring one. There are 3 levels of rooms; standard, deluxe and luxury. The luxury room is huge with 2 beds, balcony and Jacuzzi tub. The deluxe room has shower only and a balcony with pool view. For some unknown reason, a friend who booked at the same time we did (we were traveling together) ended up with a luxury room for the price of a standard. I was a tad annoyed to find we were paying more a night for a deluxe room than he was for his luxury room. When I inquired with the front desk I was politely told I was mis-informed. Alas, we saw his room and his bill \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when booking here, get specific with what you want and how much it is. I must add that our friend was very happy with his luck. THE NOT-SO-BAD: Like the other buildings on and around Duval Street, the La-te-da is an older building. With age come issues. I understand Key West has some frustrating water problems and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m far more lenient with that sort of thing here than I am elsewhere. For example, our front porch had a bit of a sewer smell and the toilet sometimes needed an extra flushing. Ah well, we weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there to sit on the porch to look at the pool, and pushing a handle down twice was no skin off our teeth. KEY WEST TIPS: If a full breakfast is more to the taste, a short distance up Duval Street is Duval Square. Right in there on the left is a great place for breakfast. I had the omelet of the day, which was made with shrimp, mushrooms, leeks and provolone. It was terrific. Alice\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s restaurant is right across the street from the hotel for a great dinner. The filet is fab. For perfect dinner atmosphere and great food is Louie\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Backyard. The service is good and the wine list is better than average but not astounding. For the budget conscious, there is a Denny\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s right on Duval. For a truly memorable sunset, take a sunset sail on the Liberty Schooner. Beer, wine, champagne and appetizers are included with the fare. They also have a cash bar. Reservations are recommended. CONCLUSION: The La-te-da is Key West \u00e2\u20ac\u201c laid back, friendly and loaded with oodles of charm. Next time we need a Key West break from the world, we will definitely stay at the La-te-da.", "Date": "December 6, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "usa", "Title": "\u201cLoved staying here\u201d", "Author": "suntan2007", "ReviewID": "UR6121211", "Content": "I just returned from a fantastic stay at the La Te Da Hotel. I booked last minute and since the occupany rate on racing boat weekend was high I was told I could stay my entire trip if I was willing to switch rooms twice. Having read previous reviews of how nice a place it was I thought what the heck and booked the room. WOW, did the hotel go out of their way to make me feel welcome and cared for during my stay. They even managed to switch things around so I only moved once midweek. Both rooms I had were great - lovely furnishings, right near the immaculate pool. One of the rooms had a two person jaccuzi- bliss! Breakfast was included in the room rate and was first class! Be sure and see the cabaret shows while you stay- I saw the \"Broadway 3 Ways\" show on Fri and Randy Roberts on Sat. Both were hysterically funny and amazing female impersonator shows. As a single female I felt extremely safe in the area where La Te Da was located, actually the whole Key West felt ok. You have the bar, restaurant and cabaret right there at your doorstep, which makes it convenient. It's located far enough down Duval St. to keep it quiet from the street bar noise but not so far away that walking is a problem to see the sights. Tips for vegetarians- walk to the \"Cafe\" restaurant on Southard St. for great and reasonable food.", "Date": "November 13, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "ridgefield, CT", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel for a relaxed traveler!\u201d", "Author": "stelienka", "ReviewID": "UR6015016", "Content": "Me and my husband stayed at the La Te Da for four nights for our honeymoon in early October. I must have looked at every single hotel in Key West online before I found this one. We came during the 'quiet' season and upon check-in, we were immediately upgraded to a deluxe room on the second floor that was very quiet, had a view of the pool and its own jacuzzi! The staff was extremely helpful, always smiling, the bartender made some VERY stiff drinks for us and the atmosphere was very relaxed. The complimentary breakfast works like a charm - you get a voucher at the reception desk which you present to the server at the restaurant with your choice of a dish. I strongly recommend the french toast, it was divine. The fruit cup was also always fresh and delicious. We never had dinner there but the menu looked very good. The hotel was very quiet and the bed extremely comfortable. The concierge was always ready to help us with directions, tips for things to see and do and reservations - he also showed us the best spot to park the car - there was street parking around the corner which was free and we left the car there for most of the stay! Now the truth about some of the other reviews: Florida is known for different standards of accomodations that the rest of the country. Key West IS in Florida. The pool, even though cleaned every day, could have used a paint job, as could some of the stairways and railings. Keep in mind though, it's very humid down there so paint jobs don't last forever. Could you see some signs of wear and tear in the bathroom? Yes, but it was a beautifully appointed room with very comfortable furnishings. The sink with the vanity mirror was one of the prettiest I've seen in a number of hotels and beats any Hyatt if you ask me. If you need a comparison with a chain, it's like a nicer Marriott or a Rennaissance but with oodles more charm. If you want a cookie-cutter room, stay at one of the resorts. If you want class and style and great service and you will not inspect everything with a magnifying glass, La Te Da is a place for you (I must say the housekeeping was immaculate - the room was always made up when we came back in the afternoon and we were given very nice pool/beach towels that we took out during the day and brought back at night). Bottom line - I highly recommend the place. It captures the flavor of Kew West in a classy and elegant way yet is inobtrusive and very relaxing.

One surprise was that we were upgraded on check-in to the gorgeous room above the outside bar. Although I had originally requested a room away from the bar (as I had read on this site I should do) we took advantage of the opportunity. Big mistake. The cons: we were kept awake all night by the heat which was unbearable in a room w/out functioning air conditioning. Also, the inside bar was loud until all hours of the morning.

Our room was large, with a great balcony/porch overlooking the restaurant/bar and the pool area. The music could be heard in our room earlier in the evenings (before 10/10:30) but we loved it. It added to the festive atmosphere as we were getting ready to go out for drinks. The other guests in the hotel were nice as well, and we had a great time chatting with the bartenders about life on the island, where to go, etc. I didn't love the food in the restaurant, but the bar was great and its right across the street from Alice's, one of the best restaurants on the island. It's also just a short 5-10 minute walk to the galleries, bars (both gay and straight) and tons of restaurants.

We met several of the other guests and most of the staff. Everyone was so nice - felt like a little family. The owner introduced himself to us at the piano bar and bought us a round! Speaking of the bar, it is wonderful. Great bartenders - Mindy and Kevin were so nice. The musicians were wonderful. The hotel is on the far end of Duval St - we walked a lot! This was not a problem for us and we enjoyed it, but I would caution you if walking is a problem. After we would hop down Duval every night we would come back to our hotel bar and spend the rest of our evening there. The pool is small, but a good size considering there are very few rooms. Our room was nice and had a private balcony over the pool area. I do not think they allow kids and that is just fine. This is a place for adults to sit and talk, drink and relax in the outdoor restaurant. You could sit there for hours - the staff is always attentive even if you are just eating the free breakfast.

Upon checkin, we found our room to be large, as we requested a room with two queen bed and had a large bathroom (in need of much attention). Our air-conditioner was very loud and we called the front desk staff to advise. We were told that there was nothing that they could do, and were not offered to change rooms. We found that the noise of the air conditioner was a welcome in relation to the noise from the bar and restuarant. We stayed in this room for 5 days, throughout our stay, we experienced 2 seperate occasions when our toilet did not work and three days of waking with termites throughout the room. We advised the staff of all these problems, the toilet was repaired, however, when we told them of the termite problem, the front desk manager handed me a can of repellent and told me to kill them ourselves and the maid would clean them up later. The pool, once beautiful, has seen better days. The bottom is chipped throughout and the water is cloudy. The saving grace was the wonderful musicians that LaTeDa has in the evenings. I would recommend having a drink at the bar (wonderful bartenders) and listening to the music.

Simple elegance, nothing over the top, just extremely beautiful. What was even beter, it was the only hotel that included breakfast, and not just continental, a real breakfast, something you might pay about $10-$15 for. The terace was so beautiful and this was a big money saver for us. Also the parking was free, the only place we stayed that had free parking. The hotel staff was amazing. Expecially Shawn. He was there when we checked in, carried my bag (something no other hotel offered), highlighted all the best activities, recomended resturants, and was very friendly, telling us about the history of the place. This was probablly the best service I've ever recieved (maybe the four seasons. . .?). I've certainly never recieved this kind of attention at a hotel in this price range.

I also ate dinner there both nights and was very impressed with the menu and quality of food. A bit pricey but worth it. Service was casual but professional. With a cabaret lounge and piano bar there is always something going on at night. A lively somewhat older crowd which was a nice change from the booze swilling spring breakers further down the street.
