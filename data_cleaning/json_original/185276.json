When I got there, Sam the gentleman behind the counter was very friendly and helpful. He even showed me my parking spot. The furniture and carpets are a bit dated, but clean and in decent condition. The suite was very large and well laid out. The bed was very comfortable. There was very little noise all night and just about no traffic noise in the morning. The hotel is located about 1/2 a block from all kinds and types of eating establishments and 1/2 a block from English Bay and the waterfront. It is also a short distance from the Park. I couldn't have planned for a better or more enjoyable location. There are no fancy shampoos or frills in the bathroom, but the whole suite cost far less than single bedroom in another hotel. And the parking is FREE! This is worth at least $20 a day in any other hotel/motel. Just about the only down side I could say is that the heating is steam and there is no control for it. The room was a bit warm in the evening and night so I just left a couple of windows open a bit. There is no air conditioning, but Vancouver cools off in the evening in the summer so same thing, leave the windows open a bit.

I give this hotel an overall positive rating. First let me list the positive aspects: good location - right by English Bay, shops & plenty of sit-down restaurants & take-away places. Close to Safeways & discount supermarket as well as other shops including an office licence AKA liquor store if you wish to purchase alcohol (there is a mini-mall nearby). Entertainment also nearby including a local cinema. Close to transport links (buses to metro stations/Ferry/tourist trolley stop). Within easy distance of Stanley Park. Apartments were spacious & generally clean. You can choose when the maid comes in to clean. Staff were generally friendly & knowledgeable about the local area. The great thing about this hotel was that it was the cheapest rate in Vancouver, free wi-fi access & allowed smokers & pets. Also had a sofa bed for additional guests if needed. OK, so this was the basic end of the accommodation market, but I still think it's good value although don't expect the Hilton. As I list a few of the negative aspects this point may become more apparent to you. So, onto the negative points: the cutlery & tea towels had seen better days - they were old and very much used, evidenced by a burnt in stain found within a saucepan. The frying pan was the smallest I'd ever seen, which made cooking breakfast difficult. The towels in the bathroom were small & rough. The bath had mould in places and really did deserve a good scrub! The water was difficult at times when showering; it would turn boiling hot, even when no-one else in the same apartment had switched a tap on. These apartments have NO LIFT so not good if you are disabled etc. There is NO air-conditioning whatsoever - I can imagine it being very hot/stuffy in summer. There is NO noise insulation - we were not disturbed too much during our stay (perhaps because the building was quiet due to it being off season), but we could hear the people above us quite clearly. As I mentioned, the staff were generally friendly & helpful, but our first impression upon check-in was frankly appalling. We had booked a smoking room at $100 per night. When we checked-in the lady at reception was extremely rude to us saying that the hotel did not supply smoking rooms (outright lie). She then argued the nightly price saying that price was actually $120 nightly. In essence, my email confirming a smoking apartment @ a nightly rate of $100 was not enough to stop her arguing, but when I suggested she called the manager who made our reservation, she did so (give her credit there I guess!) and the manager confirmed that the email I produced & booking conditions I was stating was indeed correct. However, this lady continued to be rude saying things like 'I have to keep all the customers happy not just you!', to which our replay was 'that is why we checked prior to booking your hotel'! Other smokers did check into the hotel after us & there were regular smokers staying there. Learn from this lesson - reserve via email if you are booking a smoking room AND/OR if you wish to secure a certain nightly rate. Rates have started to go up on their internet site, so do be careful that you pay the price that you reserved at. But considering all the above points I would recommend this hotel. It's cheap & central & close to transport links. But do bear in mind the saying 'you get what you pay for'.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Pittsburgh", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and free parking\u201d", "Author": "UnderwaterDiva", "ReviewID": "UR119797687", "Content": "Three of us recently stayed at the Oceanside Hotel Vancouver before taking the ferry to Vancouver Island.

Bathroom: There are some cosmetic upgrades needed including replacing the cracked bathroom window, but overall the bathroom vents well, has plenty of storage, and works fine. The towels are fairly small & skimpy, but usable. Views: This penthouse apartment has windows on most walls so you can see English Bay, Denman Street, or neighboring condos. Heat: The in-room heaters have a dial at the bottom left. This heating system is unusual enough that I think they should tell guests about it when they check in. Parking: We were allotted one outside parking place next door and one spot in the underground garage. It\u2019s small and fairly challenging to maneuver into the spaces, but do-able. Staff: Maid service was great. Front desk staff asked if they could help us carry our luggage up to the 3rd floor, but we declined.

It could be a very charming place to stay long term as it is a block from the beach and a short bus ride to Robson and shopping and business districts. Cute little apartment with a comfy bed (although the double bed filled the bedroom end to end), kitchenette and 42 inch TV! GREAT! However, there are very obvious maintenance problems that are not properly addressed by a competent maintenance worker nor is the housekeeping at all up to par. When I opened the door to my room the molding fell off in front of me with the security chain attached; then when I brought this to the attention of the front desk (with the maintenance guy standing there at the hotel entrance) the maintenance guy became irritated and said that the security chain on the molding is \"just for decoration - it would not work anyway.\" Wow great! feel so safe considering the flimsy deadbolt left on the door <insert sarcasm> So OK, I had worked in a crappy hotel for most of my youth so I knew it was not worth making a big deal over...especially during the Olympics when I was looking forward to celebrating out on the town. So I put the molding to the side and got settled in. I went to hang my clothes in the closet and the mirrored door was dirty and half hanging off - and in the closet was a large framed picture with the glass smashed in and an array of misc hangers from a previous guest. Again I brought this to the attention of the front desk, the clerk (owner/manager?) was very apologetic and explained that they have had a lot of problems during the Olympics. This mistake on the part of housekeeping didn't bother me so much as I was more concerned about the $100 damage deposit that was credited to my visa before checked in. None of the problems I reported were ever dealt with nor was I was ever offered any sort of compensation for the state of the room. The crappy hotel I used to work for offered a 15% off a future stay to guests who had any reasonable complaints - and most of the time they never used the discount...but it was the gesture that mattered. Anyway, It really wasn't at all a negative experience - I had a lovely time in Vancouver and liked the little suite. The desk guy/manager is a very nice guy (if only nice could fix problems).

This hotel was great for our family and offered space and a good location. I also experienced my first ever upgrade. I had reserved a one bedroom with a fold out couch in the livingroom; as far as I could tell all rooms were the same. Upon arrival we were upgraded to room 301. It has two bedrooms, one with a queen and one with two singles. All this for $130/night CANADIAN including all taxes. Cons:Dusty hallways due to remodel. Room furniture was dated and shabby. No elevator, and 301 is on the 4th floor by US counting. All rooms have lovely views of parking lots. Kitchen had only the most basic equipment, no paper towels or cookie sheets. Bathroom had soap, but no other toiletries or hair dryer. Pros: $130 night Canadian including all taxes. Hard to beat the price. Sam at the front desk (he gave us the upgrade) and all the other desk people were prompt, friendly and helpful. They actually seemed to care, something I find unusual in even the nicest chain hotels. We had an assigned parking spot so there were no worries about returning at night. The hotel is just off Denman which provided a wealth of great restaurants and a grocery store. We could walk to the beach. The room was clean and the bathroom tile was new. Our two bedroom gave the kids plenty of room to play and they enjoyed watching the Disney channel, something they don't get at home.

My first thought was \"What have I gotten myself into?\". There is no place to park anywhere near the hotel. The small lobby had luggage left there by early arriving guests who had gone elsewhere. And after I checked in, I was informed that there was no air conditioning and no elevator, and I would have to tote my rollerbag up two flights of stairs to my assigned room. Okay, so far so good as I'm in pretty good shape for my age, and my room was being billed at $100 CDN a night. In English Bay, the most expensive neighborhood in Vancouver, you have to give up something in order to get these good rates. And my \"room\" turned out to be a freshly painted two-room apartment with a full kitchen and bathroom. The kitchen was fully outfitted, and the bathroom had been recently retiled and painted. The living room furniture seemed to be attic finds that were in very good condition. I was reminded of the student apartment I had as an undergraduate back in the 1960s. The buildings even looked similar. The Oceanside's parking garage turned out to be underneath the building and only held eight vehicles. It was entered from an alley behind the hotel where I frequently saw policemen ticketing illegally parked cars. Then the reality set in. I was in a $100 a night hotel in West End Vancouver surrounded by million dollar high-rise condominiums. Denman, Davie, and Robson streets were within easy walking distance. The entertainment district was a few blocks away. Two different trolley-busses stopped the next street over. And both Sunset Beach and Stanley Park were around the corner. So, even if the Oceanside was more European boutique-chic than standard-issue Marriott or Hilton, this place is a fantastic bargain.", "Date": "June 21, 2005"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "2.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle", "Title": "\u201cThis hotel a little frayed at the edges\u201d", "Author": "prophotoguy", "ReviewID": "UR2308925", "Content": "It is hard to find budget lodging in Vancouver, so perhaps the comparison is a bit unfair.
