We wanted to have an recently renovated apartment rather than a hotel and the location had to be close to Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia and Placa Catalunya. There was a couple of choices, and we ended up to select this place \u2013 Hotel Consell de Cent. Actually it\u2019s not hotel and the name is not Consell de Cent either, it\u2019s just the name of the street where this apartment is. On the front door there was a sign \u201cSerennia apartments\u201d, and You can book an apartment from the web site under same name, but we didn\u2019t know it, and used this company: http://www.feelathomeinbarcelona.com/en/ed8-consell-de-cent-eixample-apartments-near-las-ramblas.html . We were more than happy about the service we got from there. Everything went with a swing, and any time we had something to ask we got the answer right away. Their website is very good and the apartment pictures were realistic at least in our case. Feelathomeinbarcelona.com appears to be very reliable and honest company. They have much more apartment choices around Barcelona, so if You\u2019re looking for a place for stay just go for it, You won\u2019t be disappointed! Actually we booked two; one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments which were both on the fourth floor. House consists 11 apartments, five one-bedroom and five two-bedroom ones (all similar) and an attic, all the apartments have also a small balcony. In every floor there\u2019s one-bedroom apartment facing the street and two-bedroom apartment facing the courtyard. Courtyard is not very attractive but extremely quiet, so if You\u2019re light sleeper, choose it! No noise at all! Apposed to that, the street is quite noisy, so try to get the fifth floor or take Your ear plugs\u2026 All apartments are fully equipped for self catering with cooking utensils (not too wide variety, and quite past but acceptable anyway) , oven, microwave, hob, fridge, freezer, even a washing machine and a dishwasher. Air conditioning (which was very effective!) is also provided in all apartments, so the place is sure very pleasant even in summer. Only minus point was the fact that there was a little if any toilet paper, not a soap at all, no garbage bags and no washing powder for washing machines. So You had to go to the shop around the corner and buy them Yourself. Stinginess, stinginess\u2026 Maybe we should have asked them but those kind of things should belong to the price without asking. Also the room was quite dusty and not very clean. And one more thing: the beds were hard, but that's the matter of taste though. As soon as You know the exact time when You will come to apartment, remember to give a call to owner Albert, since there is no reception and the front door is always locked. Albert will wait You at the front door and he gives You the keys and all the information what You need and more\u2026 He was always very nice and helpful and easy to reach. He even spoke very good English\u2026 Location just couldn\u2019t be better. Close to major shopping streets, close to two metro stations from where You can easily and quickly move to everywhere, bakery shop two doors away, Bonpreu and Eroski-supermarkets one minute walk away, wonderful caf\u00e9\u2019s and restaurants just round the corner (try f.ex. Tri-Be-Ca restaurant, or if You have too much money You could try Routa-restaurant which has even a Michelin star I think)\u2026 Just perfect. Everything You need is there very close. We were very satisfied and will definitely come back some day! One tip for metro: buy T-10 metro cards! They will cost 8,25 \u20ac and You can travel by metro 10 times with one card. Very cheap! No need to buy expensive city cards.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Consell de Cent", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d1143988-Reviews-Hotel_Consell_de_Cent-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "Price": "0", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle Consejo de Ciento 283</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">8011</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Barcelona</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Spain</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1143988", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/3f/fa/3ffa7ad5b508925cca5ca82088b217415large.jpg"}}
