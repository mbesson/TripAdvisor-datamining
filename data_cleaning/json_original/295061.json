Buffet: Very rich breakfast. We were happy with it. Staff: Staff were very polite and smiley. A major issue for me though was almost everyone's command of English apart from a blonde receptionist who was perfect. People just didn't seem to be able to speak or understand English & didn't seem to want to accept it. They would bring you a wrong coffee at the caffe, give you wrong directions, or just generally not understand. But they do try to help for sure. Was with a group of people and they all had issues with this. a 4 star superior hotel should not have this issue. Room design and size: Clean, normal size.

The Hotel is within a 2-3 minute walk from the square, hence very close to the dropoff point for the havatas coach. Istiklal Street, which is the equivalent of oxford street with shops, restaurants, and bars off the side alleys is within 5 min walk as well. The Hotel - Looks very nice, with service from entry onwards. The swimming pool, hamam and sauna in the basement are a great bonus. It has a gym - but i wouldnt call it that - its a small room with a couple of machines. The breakfast had a good choice of options, the only difficulty was the service - tables were not cleaned, and the staff quite surly. The room we stayed in was a good size (Room 517), the only problem was that there was a service door opposite where staff would constantly rush through and the door would slam shut, hence shuddering the whole corridor and the room. Otherwise the rooms were adequate with minibar, pillow menu etc. The surroundings have quite a few kebab shops - recommend Faro kebabs with good quality food. We tried a couple of others eg HajiBaba, but the food was quite dry and burnt.

You cannot beat the location; the hotel is a mere two walking blocks from Taksim Square, which is my preferred place to stay while in Istanbul. You can spend your evenings walking on Istiklal Street, or even walking the neighborhood directly around the hotel. There is a great restaurant just across from the hotel called Beyruti, which has very accommodating staff and you can sit outside in the nice weather. Much better food and prices than what is served at the hotel restaurant. The rooms at Larespark are comfortable. The bathroom is large, the beds are comfy, the rooms are clean. There were a couple of things that weren't so great. I was on the back side of the hotel and the street there has a nightclub that plays pumping beats until the early morning on weekends. Yet the pumping beats do not rival the lovely mating wails of the neighborhood stray cats. This cacophony had an eerie luster as it climbed up and echoed back and forth off the buildings. And the cats did not stop wailing in the early morning; you were likely to hear them at any hour of the day. I know both of these things are beyond the control of the hotel and it is just a small price you pay to stay in the middle of the action that is found in Taksim. The elevators are also a little slow at times as there are only two. The breakfast buffet was insanely huge with tons of choices and some different items every day. One thing I did have an issue with was being accused by the hotel staff of having an extra person in my room I did not pay for. I have many friends living in Istanbul and had several of them visit me in my room. Some were visiting for several hours one night and the next day I had a note under my door asking me to call reception. I was then asked if I was a double or a single in the room. Really? When I checked in I told them I was a single, and I was not lying, it was just me sleeping there. I didn't know that they were spying on me each time I entered the hotel lobby to see who was accompanying me. This incident greatly upset me as I felt they were accusing me a being a liar and I also felt as though I was being spied on by the staff. It was a bit of a creepy experience. But other than the one incident the staff was very helpful in other ways; exchanging money, making small change, helping with directions and Istanbul information. The housekeeping staff was very good and even left me an extra towel when I asked for one. Overall, I enjoyed staying at Larespark because I was able to spend my evenings in one of my favorite neighborhoods in the entire world! The hotel is a decent value for the price based on the quality and the location. Be aware though if you are staying in Taksim and will take a taxi to Sultanahmet to see the sites, make sure you ask the taxi driver what the approximate cost will be before you get in his car! It should be around 12 - 14 lira one way using the meter. If they quote you 30 lira they are going to cheat you! Istanbul taxi drivers are notorious for ripping off tourists. I even experienced two drivers that manipulated the meter to increase the fair. I caught them in the act. They don't expect you to be watching them because there is too much to see out the windows of the car. Keep your eye on them, if they touch the meter make them pull over and get a different cab. These cheating taxi drivers really give the honest ones a bad name. Tourists are the lifeblood of so many people in Istanbul that it is truly a shame that some idiot taxi drivers can tarnish a great experience by trying to make a few extra lira off of naive tourists. Public transportation is an option but unless you read Turkish or have someone that can show you the ropes it can be a little complicated the first time.", "Date": "October 8, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "London", "Title": "\u201cJewel in Taksim Sq\u201d", "Author": "CraigSLondon", "ReviewID": "UR118400194", "Content": "What a great hotel this is , with swift easy transfers to a exciting part of Istanbul.

However, the strange odor lingered. A plumber arrived, knocked on the bathroom walls, flushed the toilet a few times and sprayed something in the corners. Surprisingly, the odor dissipated for awhile, but returned with a vengeance later that night. It was so strong that we had trouble sleeping.

I unplugged some lamps. Someone also mentioned the lack of clocks--this is really true--glad I brought my own.

At the current exchange rate, that was USD155 per night. When I booked the reservation, I indicated that I was requesting the airport transfers that were offered on the booking screen. I gave my full flight arrival information. When I received my confirmation from the hotel, I assumed everything was set. I arrived in Istanbul on schedule only to find that there was no one from the hotel to pick me up. I waited for 45 minutes and finally gave up. I was then on my own to find my way to the hotel. On arrival at the hotel, I asked the front desk clerk why the hotel failed to provide the transfers I had requested. At first she said they didn't even offer such a service and said I should contact the travel agency who booked my reservation. I told her I booked directly with the hotel on their website. She then made a phone call to a colleague, She said her colleague said she sent me an email requesting that I confirm that I really wanted the transfer I was requesting on my booking. I never received any such email. When I got off the lift on my floor, I found the hallways dark. The lights were all controlled by motion dectectors. My room was in the corner. The lights went on but stayed on for only five seconds. (I timed them.) Fortunately there was an emergency exit light so I could see the slot to insert my room key card. For the prices this hotel charged, I think they could have afforded to keep the hallways lit. The room was nicely appointed and very comfortable. Unfortunately the walls were paper thin. The people in the next room had a baby with them. I could hear every word they said, and I could hear every grunt the baby made. I learned the hard way that hot water was plentiful, but cold water was in very short supply. When I turned on the water to what should have been a lukewarm setting on the faucet, I burned my finger. The water was scalding. There seemed to be two temperatures: hot and scalding. One other thing that seemed odd was that there was no clock of any type anywhere in the room. Fortunately, I had brought my own travel alarm clock. Once again, for the price of this hotel, a simple amenity such as a clock should have been standard room equipment. I did check out the recreation facilities. The pool area was very nice. There was a co-ed Turkish bath and sauna. One downside involved the lack of lighting again. The changing area was a room without lights. Fortunately there was a small, closet type room where I could turn on the light. It was the only light that worked. It was difficult to see my locker in the dark.

Apart from the usual tourist sights we have three suggestions for trips out. Fatih Mosque (bus 87B from Taksim) on a Wednesday has a huge outdoor market around the walls. One of the best ferry rides is from Eyup on the Golden Horn across to Uskudar on the Asian side. And you can hire bikes on the car-free islands of Heybeliada and Buyukada.
