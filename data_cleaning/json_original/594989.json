Our room was clean and had some character with original tiled bathroom, it was cleaned and serviced every day which we had not expected, the breakfast that is part of your stay was friendly and helpful. We had a room on the second floor and had no noise issues.The staff are very friendly and helpful and Jess is pleasure to deal with.

There is a mixture of people of all ages and cultural backgrounds that stay at the hotal and visit the bar. What they all have in common is the brilliant atmosphere you find when entering the bar. The pub is clean, affordable and has live music on every evening as well as darts competion, karaoke and other themed nights The staff are efficient, very friendly and always greet you with a smile. The local's are quick to make you feel welcome. The hotel is well run, very clean and comfortable, My room had a good sized bathroom a spacious bedroom, fridge, tv and tea making facility in fact everything I wanted to make my stay very enjoyable. Its ideally located in the middle of Kings Cross near to the city and the reliable train & bus services.

But, whatever the kitchen lacks, the view makes up for--with the Opera House and Bridge, and skyline in sparkling, tantalizing detail right down the hill. The staff was cheerful but the second air conditioner never did get fixed, and when it was really hot we could have used it. Lower floors had issues with noise from the live bands but we never heard them up top. We didn't even find the neighborhood all that noisy either, but we do live in a very noisy urban setting so we may be a bit insensitive to noise. Now about Kings Cross. My \"Lonely Planet\" calls it \"edgy\", with prostitution and crime, but we saw no indication of any of that. No drug dealers either. Lots of restaurants, mostly fast food, catering to the hostels which are in abundance. Potts Point, an up market neighborhood, is just on the far side of Kings Cross, and you couldn't be any more conveniently situated as the Kings Cross station is but two blocks from the hotel--but don't trust Google's directions: Find the huge Coke sign, look down the hill and you'll see the hotel. The walk to the CBD is easy and pleasant, albeit with quite a bit of traffic, but within a few blocks you are in the parks--the Domain and Botanic Gardens--which are beautifully landscaped and exquisitely maintained (no weeds like Golden Gate Park) and you can walk all the way to the Opera House through them. In fact, we walked all over Sydney and rarely caught the train or bus. This is not my favorite hotel, by a long shot, but as a budget option, that third floor room is one I'd consider returning to.", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Auckland", "Title": "\u201cWe loved this funky little Pub\u201d", "Author": "AucklandJoey", "ReviewID": "UR53122877", "Content": "Okay its not flash but it has wonderful character.

My hubby found old coke bottles under the bed which was abit off-putting. But we appreciated having clean towells daily and the complimentary soap/shampoo. The music didn't bother us too much as I guess we are young enough to enjoy it; and knew about it in advance. However we heard exhaust fan noises all night from the shared bathroom next door; and really didn't sleep well. The view we got was of a concrete wall and flats next door, which we ended up finding people there could see right into our room. We did complain only to be pushed aside I guess, the staff we came across apart from a girl helping in the bar were rude. I wouldn't stay again; and really wouldn't recommend it. it is however a gorgeous old building replicant of old sydney.
