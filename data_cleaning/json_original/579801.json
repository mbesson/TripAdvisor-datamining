{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Beware of insider job. Booked the apartments through the internet. Location was great which was just next to the Ramblas area however the positive point ends there. It was situated next to a night club which became really active past midnight till 6 am in the morning. The room wasn't insulated from the noise at all and has to put up with it the whole night. The rooms were not as big as shown in the pictures. But the final straw came when our apartment was broken into and we lost cameras, lenses, money and other valuables. When we report to the staff, they seem to pass the responsibility to us that we did not use the safe. A police report was made but the security video was not handed to the police by the staff. The staff did suggest that the cleaner lady was seen leaving the apartment with another man holding an umbrella to hide his face. Despite that, they are unwilling to do anything further. Hence we suffer great lost. So whoever going to rent this place, beware of insider job. Not safe at all.", "Date": "Jun 11, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR138809160", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "BeepBeepBeepBeep"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g187497-d579801-r7833578-Rege_Apart_Apartments-Barcelona_Catalonia.html", "HotelID": "579801", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
