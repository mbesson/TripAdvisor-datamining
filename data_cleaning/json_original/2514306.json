Hotel Pro\u2019s: Location \u2013 you\u2019re a 5 minute walk from Bayswater and Queensway Tube stations (making it easy to get anywhere in the city) and from beautiful Hyde Park (great for people watching and relaxing). Hotel Con\u2019s: Size \u2013 I don\u2019t care if my room is small, I\u2019m only there to sleep. The bathroom is a different matter. The entire thing is tile (floor, walls) with a shower curtain down the middle and the floor sort of slopes towards a drain. After your shower you\u2019ll be standing in a puddle while you brush your teeth at the sink. Everything is damp including the TP roll. Cleanliness \u2013 I am not a clean freak. However there are certain standards that ought to be met in hotels. The Annur had stains on the carpet, stains on the bedding (I don\u2019t want to know \u2026 we slept on top of the covers it was that gross), water stains on the ceiling, lack of fresh towels (considering the bathroom \u2013 you need more towels because everything is damp after a shower), window wouldn\u2019t budge so it stayed open the whole time. Continental Breakfast \u2013 3 types of breads (with toaster), 3 kinds of cereal, milk, coffee, jam. No fruit, vegetables, meat, or eggs. If you don\u2019t love toast and cereal \u2013 opt out of paying extra for this breakfast and go get some real food elsewhere. Would I stay there again? No. Would I recommend it to my mother? Most definitely NO! Would I recommend it to others?

The location is very good - both for the area around and for excellent access to the tube. In some dim distant past it probably was a good hotel (under different management and a different name). It has clearly had little or no investment in years (though several very large and heavy boxes of something arrived in the lobby during our stay - which may be a good sign). It has also had precious little maintenance down the years - however our room had a sleepable bed, and functioning bathroom. Carpets were stained (some dirt stains, more bleach stains where really stubborn dirt stains had been removed). The phone didn't seem to work, but that was not a concern to us. The room was very small - we had luggage for a short stay, not a long one, so that was OK too. Lift was Out of Order - a narrow staircase had to be used. With light luggage and on floor 2 this was OK. With heavy luggage or limited mobility this would be a nightmare. Other reviewers also say the lift was out of order, so it seems this is a long term thing (unless those boxes are lift machinery). Another reviewer noted that the heat in their room was off and that it was cold. When we arrived our room's heat was off also, but there is a thermostat valve at the end of the radiator - room cleaning probably switch it off when they clean. If you don't recognise it for what it is, then the heat will stay off - UK visitors will recognise it, others will not and will not be told unless they ask. When we turned the valve on, the room rapidly became more than warm enough, but we eventually got the level right. Staff were pleasant & helpful - They let us check out an hour late with no problem and no extra charge. Staff also had no problem with us bring back take-away food late at night and eating it in the breakfast room (did we mention the rooms are small?) provided we cleared up after ourselves. No review of breakfast because we slept late. In summary, just about adequate for 2-3 days - but only because of low price, good location and accommodating staff.", "Date": "November 18, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "3", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham", "Title": "\u201cYou get what you paid for\u201d", "Author": "darcus", "ReviewID": "UR21696688", "Content": "Hi I've just come back from this hotel.

If nothing had been said we would have been happy to take this room, but when a choice was offered we took it. After looking at 4 rooms we picked one on the fifth floor. The lift was not working ,but we are fit and healthy so climbing five flights of stairs was no problem. The breakfast consists of cornflakes or rice krispies, toast and breadcakes. Tea and coffee are available all day.. The shower in the room worked well with hot water all the time. Towels were changed every day. The carpets in the rooms are stained but are vacuumed daily. An-Nur hotel is in a prime location close to 2 tube stops. Kensington Palace and Hyde Park are only a short walk away. The area close by has a good selection of places to get good food.

I have never been so disgusted at a dirty hovel of a Hotel, and I shall be finding out who I can contact in London regarding ths flea pit. The room it self was filthy, carpets were a disgrace where some one had vomited on the floor in the past and it had not been cleaned off the carpet properly and left to dry. We were allocated a room on the sixth floor which was right up the top of the hotel, and as the lift was not working we had to climb all the stairs to the top which was hard going, good thing we only had small bags and not suit cases to haul up the flight of stairs. The rooms did not have smoke alarms fitted to the ceilings which is against the Fire Regualations and there were no Fire Alarms in the corridors in case of a fire. Also when we were climbing to our room, the stairwell on the fourth floor was blocked by rubbish etc against the wall, again a hazard in case of evacuation of the the Hotel. The room itself was so drab with paint on the walls discoloured and cracked. The shower was something out of a third class rated dump. And as for the Breakfast in the morning that was a joke, a so called Continental breakfast, it was disgusting, rolls, toast ,cereal, and tea and coffee, no meats or cheese, which should be included in a Continental style breakfast, and just orange juice.The jam and marmalade were in large bowls and you had to help yourself with a spoon in each, which was unhygienic for a start, as this contravened,Food Hygiene regulations. I would not stay in this Hotel ever again and would advise other people to do the same, I know it is cheap and that you get what you pay for but not at the cost of my Health and Safety.

I stayed in a comparably poor hostel in London two weeks prior for much less money. You will be deceived by the cleanliness and facade of the lobby as they are the cleanest aspects of this hotel. My wife and I stayed at the An-Nur hotel July 27 through July 31, the last 4 nights of a two week trip to England and I felt suckered for booking this DUMP after reading the dishonest reviews on another website. We paid $108 a night, which I realize is nothing for London in July. If I hadn't already paid, I'd never have stayed here. Pay more and sleep well. The staff are nice, but the hotel is a dump. I wish I could have seen the rooms people who have written positive reviews on this website are referring to, because I don't understand how anyone can say anything positive about the facilities themselves. The hotel is disgusting. Stains everywhere but the lobby. It's the kind of place that makes you feel dirty the moment the elevator doors open onto your floor. We stayed in a room on the first floor. It was DISGUSTING! The sheets, towels, and bathroom counter were the only things clean about the hotel. You won't want to sit on the bed or walk without shoes on the floor. There is a telephone in the room, BUT it doesn't work. Not Safe. There is a drain in the middle of the bathroom floor because the whole bathroom serves as the shower. You can LITERALLY sit on the toilet and take a shower at the same time. The shower sprays all over the toilet and would fill it up if you left the lid up while showering. The shower \"curtain\" is so close to the shower head you have to practically wrap yourself in it like a cape if you want to prevent it from soaking the disgusting, worn, moldy, bathroom floor, (which incidently floods when you take a shower.) If I haven't persuaded you NOT to stay here, then I don't think anything will. Bring flip-flops for the shower. Better yet.... Just stay in a hostel and save yourself some money. This is one sad hotel. Never ate the breakfast after reading the reviews, but sure heard everyone else eating in the atrium below our window at 6:30 am. Believe the reports about loud garbage collection at the An-Nur Hotel. The Thisleton Kennsington Gardens Hotel around the corner (probably a \"real\" hotel) has a dumpster just outside the windows on the back of the An-Nur Hotel that its staff throw bags of empty wine bottles into at late and early hours 1:00 am and 4:30 am during our stay. Garbage was collected and woke us up at 6:00. Hotels comparable to this one line the street , Queensburough Terrace, look at them before you stay here. Pay more if you have to, but please DON'T STAY HERE. Please.
