{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great Place!! Sinar Bali, was for us a great find. After spending our first night in a crappy hotel (legian village). We looked for somewhere else. The area was very nice and quiet, 10 min walk from a small shopping area and 5 min walk to the beach.The area was quiet, the pool was nice, food and beverage open 24h, food was good and not expensive. Rooms were clean (25 $ for a standard room), Staff were really great, helpful, friendly etc... We liked it so much that we booked 4 nights, then one more room for the parents, then we went to Tulamben and after 4 days came back to Sinar Bali.From the hotel, there is a little path (near the 24h clinic) that leads to the beach, there you have to look for Wayan 9bali guy with long hair and a dog names Oushi). We rents out surf boards and can give lessons. He was a true jewel, we had so much fun with him, learning to surf, joking around, and he knows everyone!! Our last evening he organised a BBQ on the beach with his friends (ones selling massages, drinks, and renting our long chairs) we had great fun... the evening did not stop here, after that he took us to his surf shop not far from Sinar Bali hotel (Son de Mar its called) and after that we went for drinks. He was truly a great person to meet, a genuine person not looking at you like money but as a friend. We were sad to have not met him sooner. He is a great teacher and a great person to meet. You cant miss him, right out of this path he is the first surf board renter on the beach straight in front of the path. Long hair, strong man, and has a white dog (lovely dog).The staff at Sinar Bali were great, we had lots of laughs. The breakfast is included so you have as much as you want of toasts, jam, butter, honey, orange juice, you can order your eggs, then depending on the day they have either fried rice or noodles, pancakes or french toasts etc... GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY!!!!!!!", "Date": "Jun 27, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR559302712", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "bigeudinde"}, {"Content": "Good Value I was looking to stay in the Legian Area of Bali for something different. This was my 6th time to Bali, so wanted to get out of Kuta. I was also looking for the best value 2-star hotel I could find.I think that pretty much sums up the Sinar Bali. Good value for a two star, but don't expect too much. On the plus side, it had a swim up pool bar, but it didn't ever seem to be attended.As for the location, not too bad. About a 5-10 min walk to Legian beach.Over all, I would rate this hotel good for the budget traveller, if you want to stay in Legian for US$25 a night, and you want a pool and your own bathroom.", "Date": "Apr 1, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR567307396", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "sventhor"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g608487-d643838-r17272341-Hotel_Sinar_Bali-Legian_Bali.html", "HotelID": "643838", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
