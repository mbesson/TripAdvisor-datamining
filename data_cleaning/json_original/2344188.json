The rooms are perhaps smaller than in other cities, in hotels of same kind, but they are nicely designed (\"loft feeling\"), impeccably clean with very comfortable beds and nice marble bathroom. Breakfast is excellent in quality and quantity for Turkish or continental tastes alike. The staff is friendly and helpful (gave me travel card for my stay for example) and also tempting to resolve impossible problems like : everybody can connect to internet (including my smartphone) except my laptop.. Given the way my room was set up, I think it is also possible to share two rooms with one main entrance.

They explained to us several times best locations to visit and how to reach sultan ahmet and grand bazar in 15mns thru the tram.. They even reserved for us the best crusing trip around bosphore while the cruise organizers picked us from the hotel and drove us back to the hotel. Talking about transportation, the hotel is 20mns drive from the airport, easy to find on Taksim, and 10 minutes away from. Sultan Ahmet and the old cities. Always ask for Hassan and Eren for help they are fluent in english unlike the majority of the locals we talked to, they wouldn't mind giving you any advice about istanbul locations and best spots. They made our latest trip amazing indeed. We are even planning a second stay early june and we'll be booking at Faros.

The only reason I have given it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the instructions to the hotel were not very clear. The address we were given was Taksim Caddesi, however this is a different street. The correct address is Taksim Dolapdere Caddesi which is not too far from Taksim Caddesi. Needless to say we had trouble finding the hotel, especially since it was pouring down with rain. However once we got to the hotel, everything was good. I would have liked to have seen some signage on the main road to the hotel. The hotel also has good transport links (fenicular/metro to Taksim Square or the old tram which runs along Istiklal Caddesi). Faros Hotel in Taksim is simply excellent. The rooms are very tastefully decorated, clean and modern. Our room had access to a little balcony and a small alcove with a desk and kettle. Generally it was a very comfortable stay. The breakfast, which was included in our stay, was very good. There is a little bit for everyone, from cereal, yoghurt, fresh fruits, Turkish pastries to cheese, cold cuts, and eggs. Tea and black coffee is free, however there is a small charge for cappucinos etc. The prices are very reasonable. Wifi is also available free of charge. It was raining while we were there and we were glad to be able to have a hot cup of Turkish tea when we came back in from the rain. The lobby is a nice space to have a drink or tea. The front desk was very helpful in providing all visitors with relevant tourist information. Although there is no restaurant in the hotel, there are two restaurants owned by the Faros Group not too far away. We tried 'Faros Kebab' on the first night and it was the best kebab we had during our stay. There are numerous other restaurants along this pedestrianised area which is a stone's throw away from the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel. However I must say that I was rather disappointed with the Faros Hotel and Restaurant in Sirkeci (the Old Town). They overcharged us and the food was extremely inferior to the Faros Kebab in Taksim. I was very disappointed that the standards were not the same at all Faros hotels/restaurants. Other than that, I can not fault Faros Taksim.

It is a hotel with very friendly staff, it has a small lobby with magazines and where you can order your drink. The rooms a very nice, clean and the toilet and shower are separated from the wash-stand. The staff brought our luggage to the rooms. When we were arrived, the hotel manager Hasan made us a cordially welcome. After we checked in, he offered us a drink and sat down with us and told all about the interesting points of Istanbul. He also gave some brochures. All the days we have stayed in Farros hotel, the staff was very friendly and gave us all the information we have asked for. We received great services! I also would like to mention something special. When our holiday was past, we had arranged a shuttle bus for taking us to the airport. Because there was a lot of traffic in Istanbul the driver called Farros hotel and asked if we could walk to a certain place nearby. The hotel manager Hasan told him that this was not in accordance with our agreement and told the driver to come to Farros hotel. He even told him to put our suitcases in the bus. When we arrived at the airport the chauffer was in a hurry, gave us our suitcases and left with my coat still in his bus. Because I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have his mobile number, I called to Farros Hotel and told the manager Hasan about my problem. He immediately called the company and 15 minutes later he told me that I could pick up my coat at the arrival hall at the airport. I really want to thank the manager for this effort! We can recommend Farros hotel for a special stay in Istanbul!
