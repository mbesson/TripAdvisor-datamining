I would have thought that staying at a Ramada it would at least have a restaurant, no! No restaurant available AT ALL, not even room service! The restaurant is closed and no food served in this hotel!! First night we got there, I found a tick in the bed, maintenance came to change the sheets and argued what kind of insect it was....an insect shouldn't be in the bed in the first place!!!!. The A/C would not get cold enough to keep us cool throughout the night! We only had the bed sheet on us (3 nights) and sweat the whole time due to poor A/C. Pillows felt like sleeping on a bag of cotton balls, no form at all, felt like a pillow case filled with little cotton balls! Lastly, the hotel room had 4 lamps, only 2 had actual light bulbs in them! We had to rearrange the bulbs to accommodate lighting conditions in the hotel room. We asked for more bulbs on the first night and never received them by the time we left 4 days/3 nights later! Would NOT recommend this place to anyone!", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "manasquan", "Title": "\u201cExcellent place to stay!\u201d", "Author": "ginny110411", "ReviewID": "UR139206240", "Content": "As always, in the Daytona area and in need of a place to stay that had tractor-trailer parking and was also pet-friendly, we found this Ramada Inn to be a very nice surprise! Check in was great - the young woman at the desk was friendly, efficient and quick to get us a room. The price was comparable (don't know if the rates go up during racing events) and the pet fee was a little high at $25 but it turned out to be well worth it. I commend the cleaning staff on such a wonderful job of maintaining the rooms - we found ours to be a real treat! Neat, clean, spacious, odor-free, plenty of pillows and towels, and just generally a comfortable place to spend the night. The grounds and landscaping were meticulously kept, the pool area was neat and clean and offered plenty of space and seating and shaded areas, plenty of parking and just generally very impressive. The only drawback was a lack of any complimentary breakfast or even coffee for the morning. I was informed tho that each room did supply a coffee maker and the usual coffee \"bags\", sugar, creamer and tea bags. The retaurant area was still in the process of obtaining permits and is expected to be opening soon for this service. Yet, all in all, I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area.

I have to admit I was skeptical when I got 2 1/2* and it was Ramada. My past Ramadas stays were less than acceptable It was located across the street from Daytona Speedway Racetrack. This is a family owned and operated hotel and I was warmly greeted by Megan and Marilyn who allowed me to check in a couple of hours early which was greatly appreciated. I always ask any hotel I stay at if they are expecting a school group or sports group and as luck would have it they were. My heart sank immediately. I requested a quiet room away from the students and was given room 244 along the backside (parking lot side very well lit) across from Homewood Suites. The Student group were placed poolside a good distance away. . They have security/maintenance man who addresses any noise issues which I am delighted to say there WERE NO ISSUES! Carpet had been replaced, lighting was very good in room, nice desk and office chair. newer mattresses , clean bathroom and asst. toiletries.. Very large older tv which worked fine ,free internet in the rooms. Lighting in the parking lot and stairways was excellent. Crest toothpaste and GArnier Fruitise shampoo samples in lobby. The only negative was the worn out pillows. I was given at check in $5.00 off $15.00 coupon for the Restaurant on site which was Chicago Uno. There are numerous chain restaurants within 1 mile radius, and it is located next to a large mall which is within walking distance., The owners really care about the guests and go above and beyond to make the guests happy. They even called to see if everything was ok in the room and if they could do anything else. WOW was I impressed!!! I did not use the pool as it was raining off and on, but it looked clean. I would definetly stay at this hotel again, especially since I used the $20.00 rebate coupon (F-26) listed in Entertainment book for even more savings.

We travel to the area often, and for the price we paid, we got what it was worth. That being said, my husband and I will probably not return to this location. Pros: Location is great, right across from the racetrack and next to the mall and shopping; room was relatively quiet and a fair size; towels for showering were okay; pool area was excellent; front desk help (middle age gentleman) was wonderful upon check in. Cons: Water pressure is minimal and the temperature fluctuation is CONSTANT (we spent the entire shower trying to \u201cget it right\u201d, so to speak. It seems to depend on the water usage of your neighbors at the time); television is almost impossible to watch as it is very old and grainy; toilet would continue running if you didn\u2019t jiggle the handle; and we don\u2019t believe that our housekeeper vacuumed our room prior to arrival as we found a very large wad of long black hair where someone apparently cleaned off their brush right in front of the sink area where we were standing barefooted. Our carpet needed cleaning. At regular price on a non-event weekend, you can get a room at this hotel for around $67 or so. I say, save your money, and put another $20 with it and get a nicer room down the road for just a little more jingle. It\u2019s too bad because it certainly has some potential.
