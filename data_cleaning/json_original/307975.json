When we arrived, our luggage was instantly taken care of and check-in didn\u2019t last more than two minutes. The second day (of five days) we had some complaints about a very loud ventilator in the attic. Within the shortest of times we were offered another room (which was even more spacious and sunny than the previous one). For the transfer we only had to repack the smaller things, everything else (like clothing on hangers) was taken care of by the staff. Both suites we came to use faced a quiet backyard with a huge chestnut tree (the rooms facing the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm might be less quiet) and consisted of a bedroom, a big bath, a big drawing room, a kitchenette (in one suite) or a separate kitchen (in the other) and a small balcony. Although Louisa\u2019s Place is situated about 2 \u2013 4 km from the centre (Zoo / Potsdamer Platz), it is ideally located.

Location wise it's little way out from the main parts of Berlin but Kurfurstendamm is a lovely boulevard in it's own right, some seriously expensive shops. However there is a U-bahn stop very near the hotel so getting to other parts of Berlin was very easy (and I hate undergrounds!).

If you have any doubts about going to Berlin for a City break forget them its an absolute must place to go. If you do go then stay at Louisa's Place, the only regret you will have is having to leave. We will be back, thanks to all the staff, especially Anna! you really made our break the best ever.", "Date": "March 31, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Limerick", "Title": "\u201cWonderful home away from home in the heart of Berlin\u201d", "Author": "GoMunster", "ReviewID": "UR59666206", "Content": "Stayed here recently during the ITB Berlin.

We had our own entrance hall with coat rack and mirror and space for shoes....a very useful area - as it happened to snow for the 4 days we were there.

The whole place was very clean. Then through the door into the sitting area - with kitchenette in the corner. Ceiling heights in the rooms made them feel very grand - especially as the windows were floor to celing and covered with suede drapes. The decor was very tasteful and classy. Our sumptuous separate bedroom was equally well decorated. We then discovered the piece de resistance - there were double glass doors from both the bedroom and the living room into a heated balcony - with huge double glazed windows, comfy seats and a dining area with table and chairs. Bliss. Great views to sit and eat and watch the world go by. The Ku Damm is quite a busy road - but with the balcony doors shut - you could not hear a single car, so it was very peaceful. Also - you are away form the end of the Ku Damm that has all the bars /restaurants and even though our apartments was directly above a restaurant - we never heard a thing. Out of the front door of the hotel - turn right and after a few minutes you will see the U Bahn (German tube) - the tube and buses run with typical german timeliness and are clean and safe. That said the best fun we had was finding the bars in the back streets - where we wandered in - used pigeon german to order and sample the local food (a little vinegary)- but recommend the Bratwurst...and my partner indulged his love of German Pilsner. All in all - combined with the overwhelming sense of culture is this feeling that the Berliners are finally moving on. Apparently there has been more building work done in the last 10 years than at any other time last century. That said - German effiency means there does not seem to be any permanent building ongoing. There is a distinct difference in the architecture of East and West - but a visit to Berlin would not be complete without seeing both. Most impressive for me was the renovated Brandenburg Gate - once in no mans land between East and West - it is amazing to see such a historical landmark up so close. Oh and out of the hotel - turn right - walk for 5 minutes and there is a Steak House on the corner - best steak I have EVER had - but book it in advance - as they get packed from 6pm onwards. People were still queuing to get in when we left at 09:40pm! Visit Berlin - stay at this hotel - you will love it.

Waiting staff not particularly accommodating. Small but posh breakfast room. Pool and sauna area was small but luxurious (steam room not working and wasn't fixed in the four days we stayed although we reported it). They opened the pool area for us at 12.30am, which was a lovely way to unwind after a night out in Berlin. Water in pool is cold, so be prepared!

The furnishing and the fittings are of top quality, but the poor service and lack of attention to details really let the place down. It is more a serviced apartment (as it says so on the brochure) than a 5 star hotel! I was surprised that the room were not air conditioned. It was airy enough with the windows open but the room we had faced the main street and the noise of the traffic continued well past mid night! The kitchen was well equipped, but there was no complimentary tea/coffee or mineral water. When I asked whether they could provide some tea bags - I was told we checked in early (at 11 am) and had our pre-allocted room swapped so the 'welcome pack' was not in the room. It never came, but we were given instructions to the nearest supermarket. We had a 3 night stay and the bed linen was never changed. We had to ask for fresh towels on two occasions - housekeeping simply hang up wet towels instead of replacing them with fresh ones. We also had to ask for additional toiletries which were not replenished. The shower was execllent though, but it would have been nice if we also had a bathtub. Breakfast was adequate but there was no hot buffet breakfast as described when we booked, unless you can count warmed hard boiled eggs as a hot dish! There was no information about the facilities either in the room, we only found out about the spa and pool on our last day! Louisa's Place could be a 5 star hotel, but it will need huge improvments in service!", "Date": "August 11, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "D\u00fcsseldorf", "Title": "\u201cA quiet, luxurious and friendly haven in the centre of town\u201d", "Author": "German_Traveller", "ReviewID": "UR5337856", "Content": "We stayed at Louisa's Place for 2 nights on the Worldcup opening weekend (coincidence!). The city was buzzing with fans, press etc. and lots of people out and about enjoying the extra opening hours. We had planned a quiet weekend away and hadn't counted on the noise on the street, otherwise might not have booked a hotel based on the Kurf\u00fcrstendamm (one of the main shopping streets in Berlin). But we needn't have worried. Although Louisa's Place is on the Ku-Damm, it's on the quieter, more elegant end, and is absolutely sound-proof. We had a superior suite (the hotel only has suites/ appartments) as part of a weekend special and its terrace opened out onto a spacious back yard which was totally quiet. The rooms were very large, spacious and comfortable. Offering WLAN and DSL connections, stationary etc., it's ideal for business travellers and with the kitchen and enough space in the living room for 2 more guests, it would be perfect for a family too. For us as tourist guests we appreciated the good beds and the strong shower and the tranquility of the place. We didn't use the wellness area (which is open around the clock!) but enjoyed the elegant surroundings of the garden room for breakfast and the library for a drink. The whole building is beautifully renovated and benefits from high ceilings, period features etc. I didn't see the marks on the walls that a previous reviewer criticised and definitely can't confirm that it has the feel of a home for the elderly. Yes, it's spacious, but it's more like a city townhouse and very nicely done up. Breakfast was excellent with joghurts, fruit, meats, cheeses, breads, croissants, 3 salads and egg dishes and various coffees / teas to order (included). The only thing to improve here would be to chill the salads, which were starting to suffer in the summer heat by the time we made it down to breakfast. A very nice touch was the personal order based on the questionnaire we filled out prior to arriving (in our case: a special juice, a certain newspaper and a chocolate croissant). Indeed, the service was impeccable on all fronts. I liked the small things like the lady at reception standing up to greet us on arrival and their willingness to help at all times. We were able to use the room until late into the afternoon as it wasn't booked the following day and the staff was full of advice when asked for. We didn't see many people during the day (it is a small hotel with only 40-50 rooms) but there was always a lady at reception. OK, to sum it up - we can recommend it wholeheartedly and will definitely go there again on our next visit to Berlin.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Louisa's Place", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g187323-d307975-Reviews-Louisa_s_Place-Berlin.html", "Price": "$169 - $1,310*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kurfurstendamm 160</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:postal-code\">10709</span> <span property=\"v:locality\">Berlin</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Germany</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "307975", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/fa/03/8b/louisa-s-place-berlin.jpg"}}
