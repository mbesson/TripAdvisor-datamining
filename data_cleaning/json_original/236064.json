The en suit was clean enough although the bathroom lock was dodgy and the shower curtain was too short, making the floor wet! Room wasn't cleaned during our stay, a man just came round to ask to empty our bin. Single glazing so it's quite loud at night but we both managed to drift off to sleep ok. You can hear the church bells which is nice to wake up to. Great location, in the centre of the Nieuwe Zijde so close to train station, red light district etc. Not too sure about the safety though, there's a lock on the door up to the rooms which is controlled by the guy on reception. However, we came back one night to find a drug dealer walking out of that door, who then offered us and other guests drugs right in front of the staff! The staff said nothing to him. Don't think it's great that the staff let drug dealers roam around the corridors to rooms. On the last day you will be woken up before 10am by a guy asking for your key back and giving you your 10 euros back, a bit of an unconventional way to check up but he seemed pleasant! We had a late flight back so considered leaving our bags behind reception, but after seeing the dealer we decided to put them in a locker at Centraal. Also we found drugs hidden in our radiator.

But it really is a budget hotel, and not a hotel to have any expectations of! If you are not bothered where you stay or what you stay in and just want to get your head down for the night then the beursstraat will just about be okay! & despite some of the earlier reviews I did not see any vermin, or get bitten. I have listed what I consider to be the good and bad points of the hotel and hope these will help anyone decide whether or not the Beursstaat is for them! Good points !! 1) Clean sheets, pillow case, shower and toilet. 2) Can leave luggage after check out, until departure time. 3) 24 hour reception 4) Location 5) Cost - \u00c2\u00a344 for one night - 2 people 6) Pleasant & helpful reception staff. Not so good points!!! 1) Hotel possibly on par with a hostel. 2) Rooms shabby & run down 3) Only enough hot water for one person to shower, soon runs cold 4) No heating in rooms, I was so cold I had to sleep in jeans and jumper! 5) Rooms and landing areas stink of dope and tobacco. 6) Blankets/Bed throws - I doubt have been washed for years. 7) Towels provided - 2 face towels, clean but well worn and tatty. 8) Some \"nice\" person coughing and clearing their throat excessively early in the morning and spitting out of their bedroom window!!!!! (doubt you'd get that at the ritz!) I certainly wouldnt want to pay a lot of money for a one night stay, after all it is only a bed for the night, but you do get what you pay for and personally I wish I'd paid that little bit more, I am sure had I done so the whole experience would have been much nicer. I wouldnt stay at the beurstraat again, I'd much sooner pay an extra \u00c2\u00a330/\u00c2\u00a340 and stay somewhere a bit nicer. My sister stayed at the Hoksbergen hotel, just off dam square (about a 5 min walk), she paid just over \u00c2\u00a370 for the one night and in comparison although still very basic it was nicer, perhaps not worth \u00c2\u00a370 but having toured her hotel and room, it was considered a much more comfortable environment! Breakfast provided was apparently basic but okay. Like the Beurstraat though, the shower in her hotel soon ran cold and only sufficient for one person to shower, leaving her all soaped up and having to rinse off in cold water!

My partner and I stayed here once again for our short break stay in the city, we love this hotel for a number of reasons first being the location, as it is right smack bang in the centre of all the action, when i say right in the centre of all the action, it is at the back of the Red light district, and 4 buildings away from the famous Grasshopper, safety wise its good as you are only 2 doors away from the local police station! (not that you would need it!!) The 2nd reason that we love this hotel is the price, it is really cheap and a good standard for the price, i know there are a lot of reviews saying that the hotel is dirty and uncomfortable. This hotel is not one to take your nan, mother or anyone that would be fussy in which they stay, i mean the best way to explain it, if you are used to staying at the Hilton hotels ot the marriot PLEASE DONT BOOK HERE! This really is a budget hotel with literally one bed (or 2 if you have a twin of course) and a toilet with shower and of course a toilet!) The hotel itself, hosts a staircase in which is much better in design than most others in the city, if you have stayed at some of the other budget hotels in the area, you will know that by design, the stairs are usually quite steep and quite difficult to master, but the updated stairs here are not too difficult, but are steeper than most british homes stairs. The rooms are clean tidy and comfortable, the only thing that would and could possibly annoy you at this hotel is the bells that seem to chime up until 12 midnight and start again at what i believe to be 6am, once you get used to them its not really an issue and if you have sampled a lot of the local delicatessans you will find that this wouldnt really affect you! The hotel staff are friendly, and will help you in any way they can, and will always give you a friendly greeting when entering or leaving the hotel, they even gave us a knock to make sure we was up on the day of us leaving to cath our plane ( i think this was to make sure we was out of our room at the check out time of 10.30 mind you!!) The hotel itself is very secure and has a buzzer door so that the hotel reception staff let you in at each time you enter the hotel so security wise it is very good. There is a deposit you have to give upon entering the hotel for the first time, which is 10 euro's which is a refundable deposit for you key, which once you check out you get back which is quite usefull as i always use this if i have spent out to get the train home! If you were tinking of staying at this hotel i would ask you the following questions: 1: Do you want basic but comfortable accomodation? 2: Do you want to be close to the centre of the city? If you have answered yes to the above questions then you will be well suited to this hotel, go for it, dont expect glitz and glamour, you need to expect basic and comfotable! Go the the Dam, go and see the sights and enjoy your stay, dont complain that its not as good as when you last stayed at the Hilton! Enjoy....

Worth getting a day pass from central station to jump on/off metro which is cheap and stops at all the main sights and v cheap. If you want luxury look eleswhere but if you need a place to stay for a couple of days and are on a budget its an ideal base, hot showers and rooms clean although v small.

Its a very basic hotel no frills, facilities or extras, the rooms are tiny and the ensuite even more so. You are provided with 2 tiny towels and thats about it. There is no storage or hanging space for anything!! You have to navigate some very narrow and steep stairs to get to your rooms. You do leave a key deposit of 10 euros but this is given back upon checking out which is by 10.30a.m. They will happily store your luggage for you in a room if you have a later flight, train etc at no extra cost. Amsterdam itself is an excellent city break, easy to get around, public transport second to none and plenty to see and do, the red light district is certainly an eye opener and worth a walk through both day and night. Drinks can vary in price depending on bar a vodka and coke cost from 5 euros to 9.5 euros so worth checking out the prices. Summing up, the hotel is clean in an excellent location but lacks any extras best suited to those on a strict budget or who just wanna bed for the night.

As two young Australian girls just touring around Europe we didn't expect much on our budget. we were greeted by the desk staff who found the cartoon on the tv a much higher priority then us arriving to book in. We were treated as though we were more of an inconvenience especially considering we had booked online, and were then ordered (not asked) to pay a deposit for the key. As we walked up the stairs we still remained optimistic that this hotel would be quaint but safe. However, once opening the door to our room we immediately felt unsafe. There was a stale smell coming from the bathroom and the smell of dope was overpowering. (which is expected in Amsterdam but a simple open window could have prevented this) UNTIL we opened the window. we realised that our window opened on to what we think is the roof of the reception below, as did the room across from us. Which we in fact could have walked straight into, hence we felt even more unsafe. We proceeded to actually open the bathroom door to try and air the room. Only to realise that part of the smell was caused by the fact that the toilet had not been flushed. Without sounding like a princess, the smell was so bad that we felt immediately ill. Moving on to the beds, we had a twin room, which meant two tiny beds. They looked dirty, uncomfortable and one of them actually leant against the heater. At the end overall I would never recommend this hotel and have actually made this comment to try and stop other people being put in the same predicament as we were. All I can say is be careful when booking online.", "Date": "February 7, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "3", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "kent, united kingdom", "Title": "\u201cit is what it says on the packet!\u201d", "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member", "ReviewID": "UR4954427", "Content": "We were a party of five just looking for a 'base'.

The toilets are spotless and the showers are lovely and warm which is a big plus. The walls in the rooms are paper this though so you might hear goings on in other rooms or people in other rooms might hear your goings on :). Alot of people said its hard to sleep here at night but I slept no problem and was at the front of the hotel, just close the windows and ye will be grand lads. On the plus its really centrally located and the street behind the hotel is chock full of really good bars, clubs, shops, restaurants, coffee shops and everything else Amsterdam is about. Really close to the red light district too.

The rroms aren't great, but they're adequate and you get what you paid for. There's a shower and a toilet and the rooms can accommodate up to five people in single beds. The beds aren't fantastic, but they're warm and comfy. And you can smoke in your room. There's a pizza place on the Damrak, about 1 minute's walk from the hotel, and breakfast is served a few doors up from that, consisting of coffee, rolls, butter, jam and some ham and cheese. The only difficult thing about the beursstraat is the navigation. There are many windy staircases and it's really easy to get lost, especially if you've been er smoking.
