We were looking for budget accomodation and so selected this property. But what we were not aware of is that it had a Indian Dance Bar and an African Dance club within it's premises - the main reason why this hotel is not suggestible for families. Rooms were ok, nothing to complain about really. Bathrooms were ok too, they were clean. But service left a lot to be desired. Twice it happened that during breakfast, when we were filling our plates from the buffet, the staff just ignored us and started to remove the food. It's true that breakfast is served till 10 AM, but who would like someone lifting off the food when we are standing right in front of them. Again the next day, we ordered some glasses to our room. The waiter came to our and informed that they had kept a couple of glasses in each room. When we informed them that those glasses were already used and dirty, he simply took the glasses to the bathroom, cleaned them with his hands and gave it back to us (which was just disgusting) Overall try to avoid this property, but if you must stay here due to your budget, do not expect 3*** service.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "dubai", "Title": "\u201cUnproffessional Front office staff\u201d", "Author": "abbasu", "ReviewID": "UR123955374", "Content": "My firend had booked hotel thru Jet Airways package and was staying in the hotel.

He gave us good directions, which we found very useful. The bedroom was spacious and furniture was new and of decent quality. The room looked a bit gloomy, probably becuase of choice of decor and the aircon was very basic. The bathroom was of a reasonable size and towels and linen were changed daily. Curtains could be better as weren't hung properly so didn't block out the light. Breakfast was good and varied on a daily basis. It was a mixture of hot and cold.
