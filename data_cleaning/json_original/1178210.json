The owner of the apartment was really helpful, friendly and an all round nice guy. The apartment itself was like a home away from home, gorgeous, comfortable, very clean and just like in the pictures. We were pleasantly suprised and very happy with the \"breakfast\" food in our fridge.......5 stars guys, We managed to walk to areas quite a fair distance thanks to maps provided in apartment and the tram stops are conveniently just round the corner from apartment. We will definately be coming back to stay here if we return to Amsterdam and will be recommending this accomodation to any other couples we know as we were so happy with our experience. Just one last note to say thank you for holding our bags all day on our day of departure.

You are given a warm welcome and the well stocked fridge was very much appreciated. If you enjoy the felixibility of going out for a meal or cooking for yourselves this apartment offers both. It is very clean and comfortable and when we visit Amsterdam we would happily stay again. The only thing I would say is watch out for the stairs they are very steap and if you have a lot of luggage you may stuggle. The centre of the city is easy to reach from the apartment just walking down the road you can catch the 24 or 16 tram which travels straight through to Amsterdam Central Station, however the apartment is ideally situated to just explore the many winding streets and canals.

You'll get a very warm welcome accompanied by a properly filled fridge-it is so nice to arrive after a tiring journey and not to have to worry about basic life support! The appartment is in impeccable condition and provides a high standard of facilities such as mini-hifi,microwave/grill,juicer (!),dvd player, fluffy towels and an immensly comfortable bed. It is in an excellent location for going out at night and day (famous Albert cypstraat mark is just there),the museums are a stone throw away and the best Indonesian next door (Spang Makandra, gerard doustraat 39). They don't take reservations; be prepared to wait or be early-menu is in dutch but owner is very helpful in finding the best dish for you. Cycles are brilliant to get around - Wienik,the owner, pointed us to macbike. We had a fabulous stay, thanks very much!", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Frans Halshuis", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g188590-d1178210-Reviews-Frans_Halshuis-Amsterdam_Noord_Holland.html", "Price": "$112 - $112*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Frans Halsstraat 74</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Amsterdam</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">1072 BV</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">The Netherlands</span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "1178210", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/4f/a4/4fa4bc9949b032c625379a4184186d911large.jpg"}}
