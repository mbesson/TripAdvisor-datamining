Away from the touristic crowds of mayor and sol and close to the shopping area in Salamanca Area. The location is very accesible to any mode of transport and we just hail a taxi bec its quite cheap considering its 3 of us. Staff was just as good as it is. Eduardo, Manuel and the rest of the guys in the front desk was just AMAZING. They help you in veryway they can. They speak excellent english and replies to your emails quickly. The room is large for eu standard and we had a free mini bar and some microwave and stove. It was very clean. From the hotel to atocha train station, we only paid around 4.30-5.00 eu. From hotel to Palacio real, it was around 12 eu. From hotel to chamartin, it was around 20 eu at around 7:00am. From the hotel, you can walk for a minute and you''ll be in shopping haven. Its around 500 meters to el cortes ingles and around 1km to the branded stores like LV, hermes, dior and etc. Prada and Loewe is just a brisk 3-4 minute walk. Breakfast was ok for 9.95 eu. You can tell the waitress if you want eggs and bacon and they will cook it for you. They have a section for those who want milk, cookies or pastries low in sugar.Different kinds if cheese, hams, cereal, yogurt and they had this multi grain bread that i really love.

It was a great choice. The rooms are very good-sized for a European capital city. All the room faciltiies (bathroom, kitchenette) were spotlessly clean. The decor is not \"current\", but the built-ins and fixtures were very good quality and in good shape. All rooms have a view of the street (super quiet) or the garden. No \"light well\" views to worry about. Beds are among th emost firm that I have slept on in Spain. Shower pressure was very good, and the shower head placement will please taller men. The breakfasts were the best that we had on our trip, and the breakfast room was light-filled, with a garden view. Much more appealing than the typical basement breakfast room.

Located in an up-market shopping area, within walking distance of Museums, Art Galleries and the Metro, we were delighted with the hotel. The staff could not have been more helpful. The breakfasts were excellent with every choice avilable and cans and bottled water were provided daily in the room. The twin room with its 4 foot comfortable beds was spacious, quiet and spotlessly clean. Fresh towels and bedding were provided each day and all the usual toiletries. However, having chosen poorly on the first night, we opted to eat in the Hotel restaurant for the second. A big mistake. The red wine arrived refrigerated. We returned it only to be given a second as cold as the first. Third time lucky. The first course of bean and fish stew was barely warm and served in an ice cold bowl. The 'loin of beef'' main course was burnt on the outside and uncooked inside. I could neither eat that nor the blood-soaked potatoes that accommpanied it. So, on the third night we made use of the cooking area in the room. This comprised of a counter, hob, microwave, coffee maker and basic equpment behind mirrored, sliding doors. Brilliant addition in our view. Future visitors should know that no tea and coffee etc. were provided and should bring their own at least for the first day as provisions' shops and supermarkets were not evident nearby.", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seattle Washington", "Title": "\u201cFabulous hotel!!!!!\u201d", "Author": "Karendan", "ReviewID": "UR71181854", "Content": "We stayed at Jardin de Recoletos on the recommendation of family, who had stayed there several months ago and raved about the accommodations.

There are literally dozens of shops and restaurants less than 5 blocks from the hotel; there is great shopping, very high end boutiques in one direction and more funky shopping in the other. The hotel staff is top-notch; the breakfasts were perfect. The price is extremely reasonable, way less than what you would expect to pay for this quality of hotel in a big city.

I told him what had happened, and by the time we got to our room, someone had showed up with ice and aspirin for me.

Was feeling a bit irritated but then realised when he dealt with us that it was just his way and he was really helpful and thorough. In fact during our stay the reception staff were very helpful.

We hadn't planned on cooking ourselves but did feel it was a bit of a bonus and could save you some money if you did want to. The room had a nice little seating area with a coffee table and settee. Small juliette balcony overlooking the garden but as we were only on the first floor we could see more of the ground floor extension. We noticed speakers set into the walls and realised we had a radio as well which was nice. It also had a small but well kept garden and it was pleasant to come back after sightseeing and enjoy a glass of wine, which was generally very cheap. The hotel is situated in a nice quite location that, although it's not right in the centre, we still didn't find it too far to walk to all of the attractions. We only got a taxi a couple of times and the metro a couple of times. We found the Metro on the whole safe but my boyfriend was pickpocketed on the Metro when we went back to the airport, luckily we managed to get the wallet back.
