However, there are many things wrong with it. First of all, the room is absolutely tiny for the price (I've stayed in other hotels literally around the corner so can compare). Not only is it small, but it's badly designed, so you can't open the wardrobe door without a lot of moving around. The bathroom was the same, and not helped by the fact that the shower leaked so we had to cover the floor in towels. Although the hotel is clearly quite new, there was already mould on the wall of our room. There was also not a lot of variety for breakfast, considering what we paid. There were a lot of minor things that made this hotel less comfortable than others - such as no instructions on how to use the safe and the TV channels all being in Turkish. I would not recommend this hotel to others.", "Date": "April 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hamburg, Germany", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location & Views\u201d", "Author": "MarkSteffens", "ReviewID": "UR127596373", "Content": "We enjoyed our stay here, excellent location, there was one less-than-friendly receptionist but the other two were super friendly so it made up for his grumpiness.

Cleaning was done properly too. The staff is very friendly, they all speak English and obviously know all about their city so their advice and suggestions were always a good addition to the brochures they have. So all in all, if you're a casual tourist willing to see Istanbul while staying in a historic spot of the city with 4 star comfort and services, this hotel is a perfect choice.

The L-shaped room provided us with a sitting area as well as a bed. the sitting area was a nice place to watch tv or read or gaze at the beautiful ocean view. It was hot in August, and the airconditioning worked wonderfully. Housekeeping was immaculate. Location was great, very close to the major sites. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go. Sunny the manager was wonderful to us. He was friendly, helpful and cared very much about our comfort. Every morning we enjoyed breakfast on the roof with a view of the sea. For full disclosure, I want to mention that a hiway and train track was nearby which at first concerned us, but the windows were so soundproof we did not hear any traffic. We heard the train whistle a couple of times, but it was not a problem. The shower was a bit small, but everything else in the room was very comfortable.The street that the hotel was on was typical old city, which means a mix of buildings that were well cared for and others that had seen better days. All in all, I recommend this charming hotel very highly.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lausanne, Switzerland", "Title": "\u201cBest Hotel ever....\u201d", "Author": "Ishtar11", "ReviewID": "UR79948604", "Content": "We went again to Bucoleon Palace, and what can we say...each time our stay is absolutely perfect.

The room was clean, modern with an antique touch, and had an amazing view of the Sultanahmet Mosque (street-side of the hotel). Even though there was no balcony, the top floor dining balcony was rarely used after breakfast and I could walk out my door and enjoy the view of the sea anytime, so I really enjoyed both views! Comfortable bed and plush towels but no wash cloths so bring your own (this must be a European thing as I've noticed the lack of washcloths at other hotels). The slippers were a plus. Great breakfast selection, something for everyone. The location was excellent for convenience to the main tourist sites: a very short and scenic walk to Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Palace Mosaic Museum and the Topkapi Palace as well as shopping. The hotel is located off of the main driving street and away from the noise of large tourist crowds so it was very quiet for sleeping. There is a tramway line on the sea-side of the hotel which I faintly heard but only occasionally so the sound did not bother me as the room seemed well insulated from noise. The staff were exceptional, always ready to answer questions about the neighborhood and tourist sites, make recommendations for restaurants, or set up tickets for excursions, in my case dance tickets at the cultural center. I highly suggest the Doy Doy restaurant as well, just a 2 minute walk to inexpensive, fresh Turkish dishes. Several times they went out of their way to make my stay most enjoyable. I will definitely stay again when I return to Istanbul.", "Date": "August 24, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Bucoleon Palace Hotel", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g293974-d1566213-Reviews-Bucoleon_Palace_Hotel-Istanbul.html", "Price": "$77 - $190*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Kucuk Ayasofya Cad.</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Cay&Auml;&plusmn;ro&Auml;\u0178lu sok.
