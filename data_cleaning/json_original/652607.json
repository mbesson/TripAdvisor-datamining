The problems started from the get go when we were left stranded at the rail station. We were provided wrong information by the hotel's front desk regarding which station to go to when traveling from DFW on the Trinity Railway Express. Once we arrived at the correct station (Medical/Market Center) close to the hotel, thanks to advice from a fellow passenger on the train, we still had to wait 45 minutes for a shuttle even though the hotel is just a couple of minutes from the station. At the hotel, the less than astute front desk person could not figure out why she could not use my Hilton Honors Diamond Card as a credit card for incidental room charges. I kept telling her it was not a credit card. Zero acknowledgement of my being a Diamond member. Although the reservation was made more than 3 months in advance, with a request for a high floor, I was given a 3rd floor room. The room was very noisy, especially having to listen to the rope on the flagpole outside the room bang against the flag pole all night. The hotel advertises a complimentary shuttle for trips within a 3 mile radius. Did not happen. We were told we could not use the shuttle. Taxis are expensive in Dallas. Breakfast buffet has some options, but the buffet area is very small and usually very crowded. Not good when you have to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a table. After the first night, I filled out a comment card and left it for the General Manager. Over a month later I am still waiting for a response. The Hilton Anatole is next door.

If you like poor service, often highlighted by the unintelligent personnel, and you enjoy not having maid service, then, perhaps this is the place for you. I decided to stay here on a business trip to Dallas. Upon first impression, this property looks like a very old and run down building. Upon entering, my image was lowered as it was worse inside. There is no chocolate chip cookie. Literally. Worse, there is no one with any smarts working the front desk. I arrived and was greeted with a muted hello. After checking in I was not offered any help with my bags. This in spite of the porter being right by the elevator (he held the elevator door...) I called the front desk and got one of their very young and unintelligible staff. I asked if they have concierge service and was told \"we don't serve french food here\" (What???). I then educated the staff member and said they were people who helped guests make reservations at locales. I was immediately transferred to Hilton's online reservations. Clearly, I was not dealing with someone who even knew how to handle hotel guests let alone ever know what a conceirge actually does. The rooms are nothing exciting. They are small, old and crampy. The TVs are LGs, but there is no digital signal, only analog signals. What's the difference, you ask? Well, seeing how the USA has ruled no TVs should be running analog signals anymore, since 2009, you have to wonder. If that is not enough, once the TV turns on, your picture will flutter or look wobbly and scratchy. Even the movies you can rent look like videotaped ones. In the evening, the front desk called me a cab they said would \"be here in 2 minutes\". I waited for 30 minutes before I made them call the cab company again. Finally, after a 45 minute wait, the cab finally showed up. Not surprisingly, they told me the hotel had not called them until 15 minutes ago -- which meant they never called the first time. The internet is no better. In fact, when it breaks service, you will have to reboot your computer just to get it to work again -- even hard wired service is bad. Probably why it is free, here - they cannot get service anyway. On another occasion, I needed toothpaste and went to the (very tiny, crowded) gift shop in the lobby only to find that it closes at 2:00 pm every afternoon for two hours. Seriously, what hotel closes its ONLY store for 2 hours in the middle of the afternoon?? The manager, Fred, is no manager at all. Upon returning from a long day back to my room, at 3:00 p.m., imagine my surprise when my room had not been touched by housekeeping. I opened the door, looked up and down the hallway and saw no one still cleaning rooms. When I called to ask what happened, Fred says \"they got til 4:30\" to clean rooms. At that point, I was so upset I said forget it. Within minutes, all of a sudden there were two maids cleaning the rooms on both sides of mine. Gee, what a, um, coincidence. My experience here was so terrible, I had to get out of here. I saw out my window and the glimmer and shine of the Hilton Anatole was casting a shadow into my room. I told the manager I was not going to pay for that evening's room so I could leave and go to another one. His only reply was that i had to beat the maid or I would have to pay it. No \"I'm sorry\"; no \"what can we do to help?\" - nada. Just a warning to beat the maid. I knew I was making the right decision. Upon check out, no one said a word. No apologies, no questions, no effort. I did not accept their invite to call me a cab given the last time they \"called one\" it did not show up for almost an hour. I ended walking myself next door to the Hilton Anatole -- a REAL hotel with staff that have some idea of what they are doing. trust me folks, stay away from this Doubletree or you, too, will be saying \"get me out of here!\"", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boulder, Colorado", "Title": "\u201cI come here weekly for the clean rooms and the excellent service\u201d", "Author": "Magoo56", "ReviewID": "UR117473470", "Content": "I am a regular traveler to Dallas; I stay at the Doubletree exclusively.

How many hotels have you stayed in where the General Manager is actually there to greet you and insure that your stay is above expectation as you head out the door?

They also offer a free shuttle anywhere within 3 miles of the hotel. The hotel itself was about a mile from downtown Dallas but it can be a little stressful driving when we didn't know where to go so the shuttle was a great asset for sightseeing.

I chose wrong. The Doubletree Market Center has the feel of a suburban hotel property: on a six lane street, near the freeway, with free parking, and not much to offer itself. I can't say that there was any one thing that was a deal-breaker but instead an accumulation of things. First, the room was very dark to the point that I needed a booklight to read a book at the desk. I would say that the room did not have a good flow but that understates the problem: its set up was such that no light could be reached from one side of the bed, there was no chair other than the desk chair, and the room was dark. Yes, I mentioned that already but it was a real issue. There was a sliding glass door that led out onto a balcony, which sounds nice but it was old and poorly insulated, so the wind whistled loudly through it and it rattled during the second half of my stay. The bathroom was large, which made me wonder why there only the bare minimum of counter space. I think the room was the handicap accessible room but there was still space for more counter room. The towel racks and all of that was across the room from the shower, unreachable if you'd forgotten to lay one on the floor before you got in (no racks outside the shower). The shower itself was perhaps the worst part of the room. The showerhead was detachable from the sliding mechanism from which it hung. The twist handle to keep the showerhead at a given length didn't work very well, so it was a test not to bump it. That was difficult because the showerhead would only rise enough that I (at six feet tall) had to hunch under it. Then there was the water pressure. Wait, no there wasn't, there was almost no water pressure. No matter the time of day I turned it on it didn't offer enough force. As for the common areas, they were okay and rather unremarkable, except for the hallway on my floor, which wasn't much taller than me, which led me to believe that perhaps it was a hotel for children. The bar area was nice and the restaurant was fine. I ate there and found the food to be passable and the staff quite attentive and kind. Generally, in fact, the staff were the high point of the stay. As for the surroundings, they are equally unexciting. There is a vacant, fenced lot next door that used to be a Holiday Inn; there's a Best Western on the other side; a Denny's is across the street. Otherwise, nothing is within walking distance, though, given the area, I wouldn't have walked anywhere anyway. Ordinarily I would have asked to be moved to another room but the hotel was 100% sold out, so that wasn't an option. After the first night my instincts told me to change hotels but I thought I'd tough it out. Should have gone with my instincts. Given the plethora of other lodging options in the area, do yourself a favor and consider another hotel.", "Date": "March 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "KY", "Title": "\u201cGreat 3-Star Hotwire Hotel - Highly Recommended for Downtown Dallas\"\u201d", "Author": "BSpeaker", "ReviewID": "UR93778178", "Content": "Pros: - Very close to downtown - Very personable staff - A mile from American Airlines Arena - Free parking - Across the street from Denny's - Flat screen TVs with all the channels - Clean throughout - Outdoor pool - Very hot water w/ high water pressure - Plenty of space (two bed room) - Great hotwire rate ($44) - Doorman - Free cookie at checkin w/ fresh fruit at front desk - Restaurant - Free and fast internet connectivity - Free USA Today - Fast elevators that stay open on the ground floor for easy entry (major plus!) - Less than 2 miles from Kroger grocery store Cons: - No complimentary breakfast (Buffet for $12 per person) - No micro-fridge Overall: - Fantastic place to stay near downtown/central dallas with a hint of elegance", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dallas, Texas", "Title": "\u201cOverall a Good Experience\u201d", "Author": "janderson27", "ReviewID": "UR92901830", "Content": "Check in was a little slow, with no Honors express line, but the desk staff were very apologetic and friendly.

Depending on how good a rate I could get, I would consider staying here again, but the lack of free wireless internet service in the rooms is a minus.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Altadena, CA", "Title": "\u201cLoved It!!!\u201d", "Author": "Auntie_MeMy", "ReviewID": "UR14896816", "Content": "I read these reviews and just prepared myself for the worst.

I had problems the first night with the internet; couldn't connect after I had paid. When I went to the front desk after a couple of visits from the engineer, who couldn't correct the problem, the person at the desk had removed the charges and was apologizing for the inconvenience (he gave me a couple of extra cookies to boot). The room was clean and they kept it clean. The food was okay but that still does not sway me from my opinion of this place. I even enjoyed the gym.

The rooms have been recently renovated but they were a little small. There is a small bar on premise and it isn't cheap either. A premium vodka and tonic set me back $8.00 Kinda high considering the bar isn't anything fantastic and this wasn't even a super premium vodka. The breakfast buffett wasn't bad and I enjoyed that. Didn't try room service or ate at any other times in the restaurant. One of the things I did enjoy was free parking and it was quick getting from your car to your room. I'm so used to having to pay daily parking garage fees. The room probably had about 30 or so cable channels so that wasn't bad. Another positive is the close proximity to uptown, victory park, west end, love field, etc..

I booked the rooms last December online with Hilton for a rate of $89 a night. As the game approached, rooms were as high as $229 a night. I am glad we booked early as the hotel is worth about $89 a night. The front desk staff was courteous at check-in. The hotel itself is clean and there were no major issues with the room - bathroom was clean and there was good water pressure. We used the shuttle service (3 mile service radius) to the WestEnd a few times and it was convenient. It saved taxis rides that averaged $25-35 for five people (Dallas charges a surcharge for extra people in a cab). A rental car would have been cheaper, but then we would have had to deal with parking in the WestEnd and at the state fair grounds for the football game. The Doubletree is not on the main drag of Market Center which is right off the freeway. It is off another street that is a bit dodgy. The other motels in the area were a bit run down. I know the hotel can not choose its neighbors, but it is unfortunate because the area brings the Doubletree down. We ate breakfast on Sunday morning in the hotel restaurant. We all ate from the buffet ($9.95) and it was a good deal. Omelet station, waffles, potatoes, eggs, meats, fruit, cereal, yogurt, juices, milk, coffee/tea provided. There is also a bar in the hotel that was a nice place to unwind after returning from the football game. Overall, the Doubletree was ok, but not great. If you can book it for a good rate (under $100) then it is fine for a stay. I think next year we will stay at one of the hotels directly off Stemmons Freeway.", "Date": "October 23, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago", "Title": "\u201cNice Hotel, Horrible Location\u201d", "Author": "MEB2010", "ReviewID": "UR10034993", "Content": "Was here for a conference recently. The problem with this hotel is the location. Market Center is really not the center of anything. The hotel itself is nice, but there's no point in staying here as there's nothing around. The hotel offers a free shuttle service to the downtown area which helps, but otherwise it's about a 10-15$ cab ride. There are only two restaurants in the area - Denny's and Buck's Prime (which is actually a good spot for BBQ but they close early - around 8pm) and the Hawaii Spa which is dodgy to say the least. The hotel rooms are nice - standard fare. Didn't use the hotel restaurant or bar so cannot comment on that. The conference room was better than average but they had a cricket infestation which seemed to be a recurring problem. The pool area looked nice but I did not use it.

The showerhead wasn't well stuck to the wall so it would slide down, but hey, we still got a comfortable shower. The plumbing in the bathroom seemed to need some updating, too. The pool looked well-kept and inviting, though. The staff were perfectly nice and I saw them cleaning up an unfortunate set of dog-pooped shoeprints in the foyer that someone tracked in. Parking: Free and well-lit. Food: The restaurant breakfast looked perfectly nice, but the Denny's across the way is less expensive, though, of course, not as nice. Location: I have to agree with the earlier poster about the location: it's a little strangely placed in a big cluster of hotels. Surprisingly, then, there's not much in the way of restaurants or places to go for a walk around there. There's a divey-looking \"massage parlour\" across the street from this hotel that doesn't really invite you to go for a walk or hang out around the hotel's neighborhood. So I'd say this: it's a good location because you're a quick drive in to downtown Dallas and some of the cuter neighborhoods around Lemon Ave and Uptown. But forget it, if you just want to do much around this hotel, because all that's there is antique restoration studios (some quite nice, acutually, but it's all mixed up and kind of too far to walk around between) and more big hotels.", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "NOCA", "Title": "\u201cGood Weekend Choice\u201d", "Author": "Tynkility", "ReviewID": "UR7420038", "Content": "This is one of the big hotels downtown in the Market Center area.
