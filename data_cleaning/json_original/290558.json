Its a great location in the middle of everything, but there were cockroaches in the room *yuck*! we only saw them once when returning from being out and no the door was not left open to the outside. you have to be in shape to get up those 5 flight of stairs and its better to have a pack up those stairs instead of dragging luggage up the stairs!!!! We saw some people who didn't look like they were going to make it up a couple of times. the room is tiny good for one maybe but not for three, unless you only care about a shelter and shower and NOTHING ELSE.

The lady on the desk spoke very little English and looked like she had never made the trek up or down the stairs herself (despite smelling like she had been running up and down them all day).The pension had a hospital like smell that tends to come from the use of industrial strength cleaning products but, on checking into our room, we were unsure of where this smell was coming from as it looked like there had not been any cleaning products used in the room for a long time.The 'double bed' was not much bigger than a single and it only came with one long (and very flat) pillow that was supposed be used by 2 people. The room was tiny and one person had to move to the other side of the room to enable us to even open the bathroom door.Our window looked into a grotty internal air well so we didn't get any noise from the street noise but we were fairly close to the reception area and were kept awake all night with guests buzzing to be let in (as the door to the pension is locked) and chatting loudly (and drunkenly) to the person on the reception desk.The 'breakfast' room consisted of 3 tiny tables in a hallway onto which the communal bathrooms opened. People walking in and out of the bathrooms had to squeeze past our table and we were occasionally hit with the bathroom steam when people opened the doors after their showers. Breakfast consisted of two types of unidentifiable cereal and some white liquid which was a rough approximation of milk. We dared to ask for toast but gave up on it after waiting for 20 minutes to no avail.The only redeeming factor about this place is its excellent location right on La Rambla.All in all, this place may be tempting as it is cheap but don't go near this place if you know what's good for you.", "Date": "May 11, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR939541886", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "LondonMel"}, {"Content": "You get what you pay for Well what can you expect for the price you pay - this place is no Hilton BUT once you get past the grafitti in the foyer, the half naked men hanging out of the windows doing handyman work with live electrical wires hanging from the ceiling perilously close to puddles and up the hundred odd stairs the place is quite charming!The receptionist welcomed us (my friend from uni and I in our early 20s backpacking aroung Europe) in and let us rest in the breakfast room/lobby even though we arrived a couple of hours before our check-in time. Our room was clean with two single beds, a tv, a basin, a shower cubicle and best of all a balcony that overlooked La Ramblas! It was a delight to sit out there in the early evening after arriving home from a hectic day of shopping and site-seeing to recharge before heading out for dinner and a dance. My favourite time was about 7pm when all the street performers were out putting on shows right outside. I think we were lucky enough to get the best room in the place so if you can ask for a room with a window on to La Ramblas. Breakfast was also lovely - tea, coffee, hot chocolate, crossaints etc It was huge so most days my friend and I didn't need lunch.
