This cheap hotel (we paid 50 euros per night by credit card) offers wifi, sat TV, modern bathrooms with power showers, firm beds and quite a lot of space. There are plenty of restaurants, bars and clubs around. Just on the other side of the street, there are 2 good restaurants (one more frequented by locals and one more by tourists). I definitely preferd staying in Beyoglu than in Sultanahmet, since restaurants are really better, cheaper and more frequented by locals in this part of the city. The breakfast is served in the underground and is not inspiring. However you can fill with bread, processed cheese, olives and so on. In case you want to skip it, \"Simit saray\" (a bakery chain) is located very close and you can buy a simit for few coins.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Moscow, Russia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location + good service\u201d", "Author": "ArtfulDodgerRus", "ReviewID": "UR115318797", "Content": "A very well situated hotel - it is on sude-street right next to the Tunnel that we took everyday to get to the historic district - Sultan Ahmet.

A basic B&B, standard Turkish breakfast with coffee/tea every morning. A hairdryer and TV in the room with plenty of cupboard space and the rooms are cleaned every day, the rooms also had AC and there was a lobby downstairs. We only stayed 3 nights in Taksim, had to stop off in Istanbul via Dalaman so thought we'd make a short break of it while there. The location of this B&B is PERFECT. And seeing what the other B&B's in that location looked like we were really happy this is the one we chose. In a busy location so quite noisey at night but this didnt put us off at all. If your visiting Istanbul for the sights, shopping and things alike then this B&B is perfect for a short, cheap stay and i would recommend.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Birmingham, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location, good value\u201d", "Author": "Shimbles", "ReviewID": "UR63359889", "Content": "A nice little hotel in a great spot near the bars of Beyoglu.

Some friends recommended the hotel for its price, cleanliness and location. They were absolutely right. Great location, close to Istiklal Cad. Clean rooms, rather spacious (at least room no 302), tastefully equipped and decorated, and everything pretty much working. The breakfast was elementary but fulfilling.
