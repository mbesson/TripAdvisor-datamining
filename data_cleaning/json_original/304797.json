Our room was on the 3rd floor in front of a busy street that after 23.00 gets a little more quiet. Room was big with new carpet on the floor and average bathroom size with some toiletries provided by the hotel. Breakfast was good with great variety of bread, cheese and some local specialties (scramble eggs with spinach! Not my favour but original) and fruits. Hot chocolate on demand and you had to pay. That's not good guys. Restaurant on the 10th floor was average in prices and food quality but has a great view in a part of the city. Gym was good and you could use for free the sauna, the tiny swimming pool and the turkish bath. Parking was free. I've parked the car outside of the Hotel, the bell boy took it (gave him a tip) and after 4 days when we left he brought it back again in one piece (gave him again something). The Hotel is located less than 5 minutes from Taksim square and the main pedestrian street, Istiklar where tens of thousands people walk every single minute. I didn't feel unsafe in the area which is surveilanced 24 hours by private security guards. Rates in the Hotel as in all Hotels varied depending the season and the celebrations. For instance we went on Easter period for both Catholics and Orthodox so prices were higher. Negative remark. Though we didn't use the air condition, we were told from other Hotel customers that it didn't work properly, so be sure before you go. Staff in the Hotel was helpful and polite and most of them had a basic knowledge of English language. You can't find this option easily in Istanbul. P.S.

We checked in at 14:00, we checked out at 17:00 on the same day! We booked the hotel through a travel agency from our country and when we arrived and entered the room we were a bit disappointed because the room had much older furniture than the ones shown at the foto gallery of the hotel web page. Moreover the bathroom was also very old and had several mold stains between the tiles. We decided to overlook all of the above and stay becase the room was big, situated on the corner side of the 7th floor and had an amazing view. So we started unpacking. Normally we never use the drawers of the bedside cabinets. This time, just for fun, I decided to open it !!!! I found myself looking at a USED CONDOM lying down in the middle of the drawer!!!!!! We immediately packed our luggage, the room was cleaned by the cleaning lady of the floor and the hotel suggested to move us to a suite. We never accepted (we were so upset that we didn't even want to have our shoes touching the floor of the that hotel), so we contacted our travel agency and we were moved to another average hotel of the Taksin district because it was the Easter period and we could not find anything better...

Loud location, the traffic keeps up until about midnight, then the disco music from the 10th floor starts and goes on until about 4. The only peaceful time is between 4-5AM, then the calls to prayer start (if you have your windows open you hear these) and early morning delivery trucks start running down the street. If you are accustomed to staying in REAL 4 and 5 star hotels, do not be fooled. If you only want a relatively clean and centrally located place to crash for a few hours and the price you get is decent - then try this hotel.
