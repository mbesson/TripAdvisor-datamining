Very polite receptionist. Small room with double bed which was firm and and confortable. The room had brown plastic floor and dark brown furniture with a small window so dark and dour and not very nice with little or no KARMA. I was on the 4th floor and the lift was slow and took ages to arrive so I walked most of the time. The breakfast was typical Spanish rubbish lots of bread processed cheese and ham and cona coffee. For 14 euros go round the corner and have a coffee and a boccadillo for 5 euros. The pillows were not at all comfortable and this place from when you enter 'oozes' 80's eg old tired and unpleasant. Husa is a massive chain in Spain and should be ashamed that they havent refurbished this 3 star. This hotel is a good way from the Metro and has little in the way of cafes bars and restaurants. Its also a good 5/6k from Passeig de Gracia..La Ramblas so get a hotel nearer and enjoy Barcelona's great night life. I recommend Hotel Porta Fira which is about the same distance from this hotel and centre but WOW its brilliant for 55 euros with pool and gym great breakfast and next to the Metro so 10 mins to are in the centre.

On the plus side the rooms are big and have a good level comfort. Its also situated in a really nice neighbourhood away from the tourist traps. You'll find some nice bars and restaurants, a cinema and some shops in a leafy suburban area 10 mins from Placa Catalunya. I much preferred this to the the tourist traps near Ramblas etc. On the downside the building I think was an old office building and has that character to it. The hotel has no free Wifi 10euros a day which I think is silly. Having free wifi should be obligatory. Inside the corridors are a bit dirty and old. The rooms have very old beadspreads and it just doesnt look right. No breakfast included.

The location was great and the hotel room very clean. The hallway, however, looked a little grubby. We ate at the restaurant and the food was good and healthy and not expensive. The waiter was extremely nice. All the staff were very pleasant and helpful. They let us leave our luggage all day after check out. I would have prefered more bathroom products to have been available. The shampoo bottle was too small for 2 people.

As soon as I learned which one was ours I've used Trip advisor. Thanks to those who has given their comments! I also liked the hotel - my friend even more as she is not travelling much due to limitation of money. We are in our early fifties. The hotel is situated in a very nice vicinity - for well-off people - and the area is clean and quiet. I've noticed cafe and market there nearby (just to the left on the first crossing going in the direction to the metro). Metro is close and less than 10 min to Catalunia square. The room for two was nice - rather big, cleaned regularly . Though it was out to the street - rather quiet - not much traffic (compared to Moscow not to mention the exhaust gases in Moscow). Breakfast was quite big, but as we were staying in the hotel for a week it is rather monotonous, but tasty anyhow. Dinner was quite nice and the wine excellent and cheap (I compare to Moscow, of course!) Recommend it to anyone though for youngsters it might be bouring there!", "Date": "April 20, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "plymouth", "Title": "\u201cFantastic place to Stay\u201d", "Author": "chancock71", "ReviewID": "UR13455940", "Content": "Barcelona - Husa Tres Torres Feb 2008 Great place to stay, the rooms were spacious, very clean and had great facilties. In a quiet area of barcelona less than 3 miles from Playa Catalunya (centre). The staff are very friendly and helpful and we were always greeted with a smile and made to be feel very welcome. Their is also a free maid service which provide fresh towels etc The hotel has a resturant which provides a buffet breakfast and an evening meal. The breakfast was great with a good selection of food and drink and the evening meal was also good value. Would definately recomend the Crema catalana for dessert; yum yum . The area the Husa Tres Torres is in; is very quiet and has a handful of small shops, resturants and an ATM, well worth exploring. The metro station is less than ten minutes walk from the hotel and only takes ten minutes to the centre of barcelona. The line the metro station is on also stops at stations that access other areas of barcelona. So you don't have to go into the centre of Barcelona to access the other areas. In whole the Husa Tres Torres is a great pace to stay, away from the hussle and bustle of Barcelona but still close enough to come back for a siesta. When we go back to Barcelona; it will be the first place I will try to book.
