I am on the fifth floor with a fantastic view of the Arc de Triomphe, the beds are comfortable and the linen clean. The bathroom is large and very clean and I can open three sets of French window to go out to the balcony. I wanted to be in an updated Haussman style building and this fits the bill. The receptionist is very friendly and the area very safe at night. I highly recommend this place to anyone not looking to spend a fortune in Paris. It's even got a kettle and tea selection in room. Some small cons include the tiny footprint - but that is expected in Paris. My mother's single room is really tiny and a bit dark, and the shower is small even for her petite frame. I would recommend booking a double or twin room on a high floor. There was some construction during the day but not a big deal.

I stopped at several during my stay - the Belfast, for example, the rooms were larger, better furnished and went for 120 Euro. When I asked if they had something a bit larger, they said they did, but would have to charge me 20 - 25 Euros more! Hotel Regence also charges 5 Euro per hour for internet access - all the other hotels I saw were free. Hotel Regence regulates the volume on its TV - the highest volume is 25% of max! Their breakfast lacked the customary hard or soft boiled egg, and they served no fruit, but their cost 13 Euro when all the other hotels I saw charged 10 Euro. Make no mistake. This is a well-situated, very clean hotel. The staff was extremely helpful. But I suggest you look around a bit more. For considerably less, you'll get more.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Montreal, Canada", "Title": "\u201cMuch better than the 3-star rating indicates\u201d", "Author": "HipTrippers", "ReviewID": "UR36970175", "Content": "Hubby and I stayed here for 11 nights in late May/early June. While our selection of the Regence Etoile was mostly based on its convenient location, we ended up being extremely pleased with most of its other aspects as well. We had room 502 facing Boulevard Carnot, with a small balcony and a nice view of l'Arc the Triomphe. The room was a tad small by North American standards but very well appointed, with a comfortable queen bed and flat screen TV. Our room, as well as the rest of the establishment, was immaculately well maintained. The staff was polite and helpful throughout our entire stay. Even though we communicated with them mostly in French, we heard them speaking English to other guests and found their mastery of the language commendable. We didn't try the hotel's breakfast, as we found it overpriced at 14 euros per person to eat in a windowless basement room. The much better alternatively would the pastry shop just down the block (turn right on Carnot when you leave the hotel), which serves scrumptious breakfasts, baguette sandwiches and French pastries at very reasonable prices. And yes, the location is excellent. The Regence is a 5-minute walk from the metro station. The metro system in Paris is extensive, efficient and fairly safe and clean (for a big city). Two other tips without being long-winded. First, avoid the tourist-trap restaurants on the Champs-Elysees and try instead those in the Quartier-Latin. Second, an evening cruise down the Seine is magical. Don't miss it if you're the romantic type.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Tijuana, Mexico", "Title": "\u201c3 Different rooms, all great!\u201d", "Author": "Jael", "ReviewID": "UR33204406", "Content": "The hotel was perfect, I loved the decoration, very french. It was our honeymoon. We had reservations on the Ampere hotel, because it looked great on the pictures here on Tripadvisor and it has good reviews. But it turned out to be AWFUL, so we moved to this hotel. Since we didn't have reservations on the Regence Etoile, and it was the holiday season, they only had room for all 7 nights that we stayed here if we agreed to stay in different rooms, so we stayed in one room the first night, in another room the second, and the rest in another room, but it didn\u2019t matter to us, we understood. Location: The Regence Etoile is PERFECT, great view from the first room. It's super close to the Arc of Triumph, 2 blocks away from the Metro station. Very nice area. Breakfast: We only had breakfast the first day, it was OK, only cereals, coffee, tea, bread and stuff like that so it was expensive. But this didn't matter because we found a restaurant that's on the way to the Metro Station called Brasserie L\u2019EMPEREUR Caf\u00e9, and there we had breakfast the rest of the days and it was perfect every day. Well, since we didn\u2019t get up early we had the brunch that included: scrambled eggs with ham, salad, orange juice, coffee or tea or hot chocolate, cereal, bread, jelly, all this for only 13 euros. I\u2019ll post pics of this breakfast too. Service: It was very good; they gave a lot of info. We asked recommendations to have dinner in a authentic French food restaurant, and the guy told us about Le Galvacher. So we went there and it was VERY VERY good, it was like 4 blocks away from the hotel, in an area that is not really touristy, so we only saw locals eating there, so it truly was great, it\u2019s kind of expensive but totally worth it for at least one night. Since is not really for tourists, nobody spoke English nor Spanish so we just pointed at something on the menu (I just checked it didn\u2019t say snails\u2026) and both dishes were spectacular! The housekeeping was nice, they do a great job, everybody was very polite. Rooms: They were all beautiful, the first two had great views, and the third one didn\u2019t, but it was the only that had a separate room with a desk, chair and a loveseat that we used to put our luggage. All the rooms had a minibar, and the bathrooms were very clean and big. The rooms had a small flat tv, that we only used once and watched a weird Italian show haha, The decoration is very French, very romantic. All the room had an old gas heater that only added to the decoration, since we didn\u2019t need to used them, even though it very cold outside. We never heard any noise coming from outside of our room which was nice. Lobby: It was nice, small, and they have a beautiful fireplace with a lot of flowers. There is only one small elevator, like in the rest of Paris hotels. We highly recommend it, and will definitely stay here when we go back.", "Date": "June 26, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Oxford, England", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location, Perfect Place\u201d", "Author": "VAM1", "ReviewID": "UR30362927", "Content": "I stayed here with my 78 year old mother on her first visit to Paris and it was ideal.

If its your first visit to Paris I strongly suggest you make the most of the Metro which will take you where ever you need to go and if you buy a Paris Visite ticket you never have to pay.

The breakfast was continental; tea and coffee both tasted lovely; bread rolls were superb - everything was available you should want to start your day. The room/bathroom was clean (no cigarette smell or mould round the bath), light and airy. My only slight quibble was that there were no hot drink making facilities in the room; but there were cold alcoholic/drinks in the fridge and very reasonably priced. The shower was great (usually they are not in hotels, in my experience!). Our room was at the front of the building and you could look out of the window to see the Arc de Triomphe a few hundred yards up the road.

If it is a short break, get a 'carnot' of 10 train trikets. Each ticket gets you to any destination in the centre of Paris. We decided we must go to the top of the Eiffel Tower but only on the third time of going did we consider the queue not soooo long to put us off. Having queued for tickets, you don't realise you then have to queue to get on the cable car, then you queue to get from Level 2 (where you change cable car) to the top; then you queue to come back down to Level 2; then you queue to get to the bottom. It took us longer to climb the Eiffel Tower than it took us to get to Paris on the Eurostar from St Pancras. There was a howling gale and it was bitterly cold.
