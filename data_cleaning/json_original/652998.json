At least the No1 Tower maintained a steady and reasonably cheap option on the lead up to booking so I gave it a try despite some less than perfect reviews. The location is almost adjacent the Financial Centre metro station on the seaward side of Sheik Zayed road and is very convienent for the Dubai mall, Burj Khalifa even for those who like to walk. The accomodation is apartments although there is a reasonable if smallish 24 hour lobby and reception area at the side with a small cafe which didn't appear to be open all night and although I didn't use it I don't believe alcoholic drinks were available here. Check in was quick and didn't even require my booking credit card presenting which speeded things up at a late hour. As usual as I find in Dubai there was very little happiness or welcome from the counter staff. The lift access to the rooms was round the corner in the lobby from the reception meaning you come come and go without being in the full glare off the reception although some may see this as a security issue as there was free access to the lifts. I booked a larger panoramic view apartment which occupies the corner of the rear of the building and found it to be quite spacious with as advertised a wide view of the seeward vista of Dubai (Jumeirah area and the sea a mile away) although this did include much of the apartment block next door in view. Mainly open plan with a small divider wall for the bed area it had a small kitchenette area in the entrance hallway with a hotplate but annoyingly no microwave. Basic utensils were supplied and a few bowls and plates. The Bathroom had bath and shower and was fitted out in marble effect and was quite good although the drain on the floor backed up when emptying the bath and flooded the floor which didn't drain away too quickly.Towels and minimal washing lotions were supplied daily. The living area consisted of hard leather sofa and chair with coffe table and a 32 inch LCD TV on the wall although this was fixed and couldn't easily be seen from the bed. I did't see any movie channels available and the free channels although varied were often poor quality reception. The bed was surprisingly large and comfortable althugh the sheets had a slight plastickly feel which some may not enjoy. The air conditioniong seems to have one cold setting even though having a thermostat and this made the room too cold at night nearly always meaning that you had to turn it off completely before going to sleep. There was no particular noise from adjacent rooms or any building work nearby and being at the back of the building and high up there was no noise from the busy Sheik Zayed road. I can't comment on the hotel services as I don't use room service or eat in hotels and there are plenty of food outlets (and bars) not too far away. The pool is indoor only and is small and there are no apparent areas wihin the building to get some sunshine although I believe the smaller non panorama rooms may have limited balconies so this isn't a place to relax in the sun for a few days. Overall it's a large no frills (thrills?) apartment not bad for the price and location. The downsides are that it's just not classy, it's a place to stay in rather than enjoy being there and lacks a few touches that other albeit more expensive locations enjoy. I also was not particularly impressed with some staff attitudes and as I've read in another review the desk staff seem to be making comments about you between each other to the point where i was was pointed at by the receptionist who then shared a joke with his colleague after checking out while sat waiting in the lobby for a taxi. As a place to stay given minimal contact with the staff and facilites and you want more than space than a small hotel room (panorama room, unfortunately I can't comment on the standard rooms although they did look much smaller on the fire plan) this may be a good choice. Those wanting a lasting experience may be better suitable elsewhere on Sheik Zayed.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "2"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cTry elsewhere\u201d", "Author": "miryas", "ReviewID": "UR120418599", "Content": "I used ti live in Dubai went back to visit friends, I like Sheikh Zayed road so wanted a hotel there.
