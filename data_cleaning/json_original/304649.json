{"Reviews": [{"Content": "No Response I saw this hotel on a travel magazine and it has been one of my want-to-stay hotels since then. The pictures on the magazine looked very pretty and the cozy staying seemed to be promising.We decided to visit bali in February, and I first e-mailed them for room availability, There was no response. Then I made an inquiry through their web site, still no response. After several days of waiting, I called them up and I was glad they picked up the phone. The person who answered the phone told me they had a room for us, and told me he would have his manager contact us next day. I haven't received any e-mail from them... yet.I booked another hotel.", "Date": "Feb 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR321409663", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "1", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "BACARDI_ORO"}, {"Content": "Quiet and peaceful place               More photos", "Date": "Nov 13, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR373150704", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "strangger"}, {"Content": "Wonderful view, but may be noisy at night My wife and I stayed in Byukukung hotel end of August 2006. After visiting one room of each comfort level (actually 3 : room with inside bathroom, room wih outside shower, suite), we chose room Kokokan 1, which was said to be the best one, closest to the swimming pool and with the best view.We paid 90 USD inc. breakfast.Location : 15 minutes walking from Ubud palace (=center). A bit apart from a big street, but be careful, night may be pretty noisy because of restaurants, local celebrations, ... in the very close neighbourhood.Room : ours was large (around 50 sqm), with nice wood roof and ground. Best was bathroom : outside part is actually a jacuzzi directly looking at the rice fields. Extremely pleasant and relaxing.Setting is such that you have to walk around the room to enter it, walking on a kind of little bridge over the rice fields. You feel perfectly isolated, nobody but you has to come to the room. You also have your own terrace with Bale (outside day bed).It must be said that room was clean compared to Bali's average.Breakfast : limited quantity, but clean.Value for money : good but not high. You especially pay the location.Traveler's tip : do not go to the Duck restaurant close to the hotel. It is really dirty, and has become a tourist attraction, as many people (mostly japanese) are brought there with buses. No good food, no fresh food, high prices.", "Date": "Oct 17, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR317453005", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Epigone"}, {"Content": "Far better hotels in Ubud for the same price I visit Ubud twice a year and have stayed in many of its Hotels. I would strongly advise that you do not stay at this hotel, quite simply it is not value for money and not up to standard when compared to the competition.The rooms are very small, not well maintained, poorly sound insulated (you can hear every word your neighbour speaks), the restaurant is a joke and the staff are not helpful. Prefering to watch the Television in reception than deal with your queries.I could not wait to leave!I would strongly recomend that you pay a little extra and stay at the Barong,the Komaneka, or the Kamandalu. These are good hotels where the attention to detail is excellent and the staff are professional and attentive.", "Date": "Feb 23, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR266125010", "Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Wonderful stay        lovely swimming pool blending with the paddy field!", "Date": "Feb 21, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR466880452", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "apii"}, {"Content": "Oooh....I love Biyukukung, Bali.......

On arrival we realized that with the bathroom on the ground level and the bedroom upstairs, my parents wouldn't be able to stay there as they have difficulty using stairs. We decided to stay one night out of courtesy and had our agent let the hotel know the same day that we could not stay the whole 3 days and why. The manager was very unhappy and kept insisting that we pay for all 3 nights, even though we explained that we didn't know these rooms were 2 stories and that we had older people who couldn't use the stairs. In the end, our agent had to come from Denpasar and meet with us and the manager. We settled on paying for one room for one extra night although we would not be staying there.We have to be fair and say that the view of the rice field and the pool area are very pretty. They were burning the field which made our room quite smoky. The bathroom sink area has a small counter which is mostly taken up by the kettle and coffee cup tray so there is little room to put your own things. As well, these rooms are unsuitable for a family of 4 - just too small. There was no where to unpack or even to put our suitcases where there would be easy access to them. Perhaps one of the 2 suites would have been better but they were being reserved for the owner who was arriving at some point. Lastly, the breakfast was only adequate and cooked to order so took some time to come. After checking several other hotels, we realized that most have nicer breakfasts with more choice and larger portions or buffet style.We love Ubud and will return but not to this hotel.", "Date": "Feb 25, 2005", "ReviewID": "UR930412223", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "2", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "A TripAdvisor Member"}, {"Content": "Biyukukung The standard rooms are really small and not confortable.
