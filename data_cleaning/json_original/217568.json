Immediately we were pleased to be greeted by a very friendly desk manager making our very affordable room reservation easy and expedient. We found the rooms very nice and we were amazed the hotel offered golf cart valet service preventing guest from having to walk up the steep parking lot. The swimming pool was located discretely out of sight of the highway 76 traffic making our swimming experience very relaxing. Starting each morning was wonderful with a Continental breakfast including coffee, juices, cereals, toast and the best part was a hostess making guests fresh hot waffles. Probably the best selling point for the Branson Melody Lane is their location right in the middle of all the Branson magic. Next door is one of the greatest mexican resturants called Poncho Villa and a few steps further is a fantastic trip back in time at the 50s theme ice cream shop called Cakes and Cream. If it is shopping you like then you will love the Branson Melody Lane being right across the street from the Grand Village that features very unique shopping experiences including Kringles Christmas store, Thomas Kinkaid art gallery, wood carvers, tasty seasoning specialist and then you can grab lunch at Mel's Hard Luck Diner where the servers not only bring you incredible old fashioned hamburgers and malts but the servers also sing to you. What is a trip to Branson without the multiple shows to select from? The Branson Melody Lane is walking distance from The Branson Variety Theater, The Baldknobbers, The Presleys, The Haygoods, The Wax Museum and even a voyage aboard the Titanic. The best part about going to these shows and attractions while staying at the Branson Melody Lane is you never have to get in your car and fight the Branson traffic unless you just enjoy that type of stuff.

We weren't sure if we would like doing that, but it turned out to be one of the best places we have ever stayed. Melody Lane is NOT a brand new hotel, in fact, I believe it is one of the oldest on the strip. It is, however, very clean and neat, which is all that matters to me, my husband, and our 4 teenagers. We stayed in the family room, which consisted of a large living room, kitchen and dining room downstairs (with full washer and dryer), and upstairs were 2 bedrooms with queen beds, and 2 bathrooms, one with a corner shower, and one with a shower/tub combo. It had its own little porch, and we could step down into the little couryard shaded with trees and sit on the swings and watch traffic crawl by! We also walked next door to a wonderful little Mexican restaurant, walked across the street to a really cute little shopping area with an awesome book and puzzle store, and walked other places. We were right next to Baldknobbers and across the street from Presleys, and Landry's seafood, and the wax museum, and putt-putt...Best of all, the staff was very kind and helpful, AND the rates were great.

While we normally stay at the nicer 3 and 4 star hotels, because we wanted to spend our money on the shows, we picked this motel for its price. To tell the truth, I was expecting the worst but was pleasantly surprised. While this is an older motel (looks like something you might have stayed at with your parents in the 60s as evidenced by the furnishings) it is very neat and clean and offers the same toiletries as the 4 stars. Also, the front office is on the flat part of the road but once you drive around the office to go to the rooms, they are on a steep, downwards slope . However, you will get used to this as this is true of almost all of the hotels and theaters in Branson. What we liked about the Melody Lane Inn's design was that they placed an entrance way at each level opn the slope so that if you parked near that entranceway, you just walked out onto a flat walkway - no matter what level (1, 2, 3, or 4) your room was on and didn't have to use the stairs. The front desk personnel were friendly and helpful. There is a tour/ticket desk in the lobby with brochures and tickets for everything. AThey also put coupon books in your room so you don't have to search for discounts. As a final point, Melody Lane Inn advertises a continental breakfast included, but what you get is more than the usual definition of \"continental.\" Cereals, toast, coffee, tea, juice, milk, waffles, and fruit. We enjoyed our 3 day stay even if they don't have the latest in mattresses and would definitely stay there again.

As one reviewer already mentioned, within walking distance to shows and restaurants. 2) Staff was very friendly and helpful. (There must have been a change of management or something since the 2007 reviews were posted here.) 3) I was a little dismayed to have to lug my suitcase up the stairs to our room, but this is the style lodging it is, so I dealt with it. 4) I thought there was an odd odor (not strong, though) in the open air stairwell and balcony, but our room didn't smell at all. 5) Our room was basic and a bit worn (maybe it was just a seeming out of date carpet and bedspread designs or maybe it was that we had recently stayed in a nice Hampton Inn) but all was very clean and comfortable. (I will get to how comfortable in a minute.) 6) Room service was daily and kept us well supplied. This staff was also very friendly. 7) Now to the comfortable: Our first night there, after we walked home from a show, I ended up horrible ill - vomiting every 15-20 minutes from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. I also had a bit of a fever and chills. Needless to say, I got very little sleep. I then spent the next day crawling from the bed to a warm bath as I had no energy and all my body ached. With my stomach so raw and me being dehydrated, I sucked on cupfuls of wonderfully refreshing ice cubes in endless supply from a machine at the foot of the stairs. The following day was spent mostly in bed or sitting in a chair. All that time of being sick, not once did I wish I was home in my own bed or bathroom - I was very comfortable right where I was. (Though I do have to admit that those ice cubes lost their magical elixir like powers the less dehydrated I became, though they still were fine. :-) 8) The following day I slowly made my way down to the dining room and while I was not overly impressed with the variety (again having recently stayed at the HI and my stomach still being in a bit of a finicky mood), it certainly had a basic selection that would do just fine: freshly made waffles, toast, hot and cold cereals, and beverages.

There was no smoke smell in the room. The airconditioner was a wall unit but worked well and was quieter than this type usually is. This was the first hotel I have ever stayed in that I did not have to use earplugs to be able to sleep. We brought our own air mattress because we can't sleep on the normal hard beds in hotels, but the bed in our room was VERY comfortable and we did not need to use our air mattress. There was a small couch that folded out into a bed and a comfortable chair and foot rest. The front desk staff were very helpful. We decided to stay an extra day and they helped us stay in our old room and gave us a good rate-then we changed our minds and they were very nice and understanding in canceling the extra day. There is a place right in the lobby to purchase show tickets-with or without the usual time share speel-no pressure if you don't want to listen to the time share talk for cheaper tickets. The price of the regular tickets was the same as anywhere else and they booked them so we never stood in line anywhere. Because it was not prime time in the summer it was not crowded. The ladies in the breakfaste room worked really hard at keeping things filled and CLEAN!! Fruit, cereal, bagles, toast, waffles, juices, milk and coffee were the breakfaste offerings. (There is a nice buffet at Baldnobbers next door if you want something else for breakfaste without having to drive.) We even got up late one morning and there was still plenty at 9am. Most other places we have stayed are all out of free breakfaste by 7 or 8.The outdoor deck out side of the breakfaste room was a relaxing place to plan our day as we ate. The inside breakfaste room had a tv turned to the news but turned low so you could listen or not without being annoyed. The outdoor pool was very clean but cold--there was a matience person fixing the heater and we did not have time to go later in our stay.. The small hot tub was very warm and pleasent.

WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE! The motel is centrally located and very well kept. Everything was in working order and CLEAN. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I had never seen a motel with such a steep parking lot (many of the motels in Branson are like this) and Melody Lane Inn even had a large golf cart driven by their employees to take you up and down the hill. The breakfast room was clean and guests never ran out of anything. We will recommend Melody Lane Inn to all of our friends going to Branson!", "Date": "July 17, 2004"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Boston, MA", "Title": "\u201cWhat a fun place! Go to the Showboat! Stay at the Grand Victorian\u201d", "Author": "xine1123", "ReviewID": "UR1836076", "Content": "We just returned from a great trip to Branson. We started out staying at the Melody Lane Inn, which is about as basic as you can get, (almost drab) but was clean. It was a warm week, and we were very disappointed that the pool wasn't open, even just to sit around, nor was the hot tub. Both were empty. We checked out after one night and moved to the Grand Victorian down the street, which is a beautiful hotel. The staff there could not have been nicer, the rooms are great, and they have a wonderful complimentary breakfast each morning. Our rooms overlooked the Ozarks and were so comfortable. We all had a balcony. It's very reasonable, also. We saw 4 shows and the best of all was the Branson Belle Showboat. It was wonderful and worth every penny! The talking dog act is hysterical, and the Russian dancers were fabulous. See it if you can. We also saw Stuck in the 70's, Lost in the 50's, and the Legends show. They were all good. Wish we had time for more.", "Date": "April 25, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Melody Lane Inn", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g44160-d217568-Reviews-Melody_Lane_Inn-Branson_Missouri.html", "Price": "$59 and up*", "Address": "<address><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">2821 West Highway 76</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:municipality\">Branson</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">MO</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">65615</span></span> </span></span></address>", "HotelID": "217568", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/f0/f6/f0f672226937fe55cda2768bcdd380cb9large.jpg"}}
