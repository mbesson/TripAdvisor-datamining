I'd booked my trip -- flight + hotel -- on Expedia. On the morning following my 1st night there, I sent for breakfast and was surprised to be told that the rate I got did not include breakfast. I had a very light meal and the waiter said he wouldn't charge me for the whole buffet but rather \u00e0 la carte de couple of toasts I had. Nevertheless, it doesn't change the fact that I find it somewhat \"cheap\" that any luxury hotel would charge you over and above for every little thing, from Internet access to in-room coffee to breakfast. (To be clear, this hotel charged for none of this -- except, in my case, breakfast -- and had bottles of water and green apples available at every floor.) So I tweeted this before going out. When I got back to my room, I found a very personalized letter **en fran\u00e7ais!** from the hotel manager, thanking me (!) for posting a comment on Twitter. The letter explained that the hotel currently ran two rates -- that is, with and without breakfast -- and that Expedia rates were of the latter type. The letter mentioned that soon, all rates would include breakfast. But the letter also included information about a deal this chain has in place with my organization (which means they actually did some background research on me!) and concluded with a pledge to offer me free breakfast for the remainder of my stay. Wow. Some would call this customer empowerment, or a good exemple of service failure recovery (and the paradox that comes with it). I just call it outstanding service. This hotel may be as clean, well-located, and nicely decorated, these are all basic factors to me. What will keep me going back to it from now on is its human, personal touch. Merci for a great stay!

I had an issue with my corporate credit card, the card seemed to have lost its readibility, and had to use my personal card. Later, after I had checked in, the manager heard about this from her front desk and she personally called Amex to verify my card and manually put the charge on the corporate card. A nice touch.

The package came with free breakfast and valet parking which, on an event night was much appreciated. Granted breakfast is a small selection of fruits, pastries, cereal and juice, but it was kept spotlessly clean and we felt the offerings were fine----with a lovely selection of teas for those of us who aren't coffee drinkers. The area is a light filled space on the second floor. Before the game we had dinner at e11even the restaurant on site and all 4 of us really enjoyed the upbeat ambiance, the food and service. This was our second time at the restaurant and we still give it high marks. The skywalk to the ACC from the Maple Leaf complex was much appreciated on a rainy evening, and if there are no events, it's also a direct way to access the Path from the hotel.

Breakfast, which was included in the rate was fine, although nothing special, with assorted cold meats, bread items, and many fruits and cereals.

It started out very well however we left feeling very disappointed. Here is what we liked and what we didn't like: 1. When we arrived there was a very nice cheese sampler waiting for us in our room. 2. The room and bathroom were very clean and modern. 3. The desserts from room service were fantastic Why we were disappointed: 1. When we checked out there was a bar charge added to our bill. We never went to the bar during our stay. When I asked how this happened I was told that someone may have accidentally used our room number on the bill. The charge was reversed however they need to have a better system in place that even requires a signature or a card swipe. It's unsettling to think a charge could be added just by saying any room number. 2. There were two pillows that we slept on top of the king size bed. The next morning when my wife woke up and turned the second pillow around (the one underneath), she noticed there was a large dry blood stain on the pillow. This was not from her as the colour was a light brown. You could tell it had been washed several times as it hadn't fully been removed. At first we were going to take the pillow down to the front desk but decided to call the manager up to our room and speak to her in private so as not to make a scene. When she came up we showed her and told her how this should not have even been used by the housekeeping staff and put on the pillow. It's not like it was a small stain, it was very large and obvious. It was disturbing to think that someone from the staff would even put this pillow case on. Needless to say it left a very sickening feeling in our stomach to know that was there the entire night. The manager apologized and agreed that this had been washed before but the stain hadn't been removed. She also agreed that this shouldn't have happened and took the pillow case and said she'd meet us at the front desk. I took a picture of it just in case. We then went to check out thinking she'd at least provide some sort of discount from our room. Instead she gave us her card and said the next time we come to stay to ask for her and she'd give us a room upgrade. I really felt that we should have been discounted right then and there as supposed to us having to return. To be honest I don't believe we will ever return as this is not something we'd expect from a hotel of this standard and price.

Appreciated the controls by the bed. Staff were all friendly and helpful. The breakfast area/lounge on the second floor was nice. Breakfast items included breads, pastries, cheeses, cold cuts, lox, bread pudding, yogurt, juices and a nice coffee machine that makes espressos, caps, lattes, etc. It's about $20pp though which I feel is a little pricey for a basic spread like this. It's really more for the convenience that one would have breakfast in the hotel since there isn't much in the immediate vicinity and you'd have to walk up a few blocks before you reach other cafes and restaurants. It's a short walk to the St. Lawrence Market and the PATH is connected through Union Stn/Air Canada Center, which is convenient if the weather isn't nice enough to walk in. Union Station is convenient for striking out on the subway. One can take a shuttle from the airport to the Fairmont Royal York and then walk down a couple blocks to the hotel. The driver told me that I should have let him know I was staying at this hotel as he could have dropped me off so that I didn't have to walk down (the bus passes right by the hotel). My husband brought a car with him when he joined me for a couple days and valet was easy though a bit pricey. I suppose it's representative of most hotels in the city though. The rainshower was nice but I think the fixture needs to be decalcified as a number of the openings didn't have water coming through. The pressure was a little on the light side which could have been a result of the clogged openings or water pressure or both. The room had a Nespresso machine in it but they charge $2/capsule. I thought that was a little disappointing considering the room rates and the fact that each capsule is less than $1. Also, note that there's no iron and ironing board in the room.

The original is on Mercer Street and is a better experience than its new sibling at Maple Leaf Square. The designs are basically the same: contemporary finishes, fairly streamlined, overall clean and appealing, if not a little bit dated. I stayed in the smallest/lowest level room, which was a good size and featured very good light through a giant picture window. The view was of a construction site and highway, which was not so great, but that will get better over time as other projects in this emerging area are completed. Many of the rooms feature stall showers, as mine did, which I find very appealing. What is not appealing and leaves one to scratch his or her head is the incomprehensible lack of proper closet space. My room had two hanging closets, which were part of a \"system\", but had only two drawers and no shelves. The two drawers are located at floor level, so you have to bend down and touch your toes in order to access them. The space above the drawers was empty and useless, no hanging, no shelves, no hooks, just empty. In addition, the in room safe is located in an equally inconvenient floor level location so it's impossible to use without being on your hand and knees. The lighting and HVAC systems are an absurd, failed attempt at cutting edge efficient. The only way to turn on the lights is to insert your key in a slot by the door. This means of course that you have to leave your key there instead of in your wallet or bag, so the chances of forgetting it when you leave are high. Also, the privacy/service buttons, while sleek in replacing a door hanger, are located at the bed, not by the door, so as you're leaving, you have no way to see how it was left, and if you want to change it on your way out, you have to go back to the bed. The service is willing and friendly, but not quite up to par for the price of the hotel. I spent about $440 per night for the cheapest room before taxes or gratuities. I did not get turn down service any of the nights I was there (I asked once the first night) and the housekeeping in the room was a little haphazard (the clothing that I was forced to leave on the desk for lack of adequate closet space was always re-arranged after a housekeeping visit; some fruit that was delivered as a welcome gift - a nice touch - was left to decay for a few days before being removed, etc.). The common spaces (bar, breakfast area, etc) are adequate, but not luxurious or welcoming. Finally, the location is a disaster, at least in its current state. One of Toronto's nicest features is the walking accessibility of most downtown areas. While one can walk to most places from this location (and I did), it requires going under a dark, filthy underpass on a narrow sidewalk to get to southernmost portion of the downtown area. In addition, the surrounding area is one giant construction site, so there's no break from the noise, dirt and unappealing view. This will obviously improve with time, but it makes for a very unpleasant surrounding at present. I've stayed many times at the other Hotel Le Germain on Mercer Street, and I would recommend that one over this location despite the fact that this one is newer.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Location": "3", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel on every level\u201d", "Author": "Brendan M", "ReviewID": "UR118152714", "Content": "In town for the Toronto Film Festival, I ended up leaving another hotel (Hyatt Regency -- a dump) and switching to this hotel mid-stay.

We finished our honeymoon at Le Germain this weekend (August 19-21st) and had planned on lots of sight-seeing activities. The concierge service, in particular Susan and Gregory, was phenomenal! They spent as much time with us as needed to help plan our sight-seeing and dinner trips. They listened to what we wanted to do and came up with great day trip itineries. Our room was beautifully appointed - very modern with a most amazing view of the city. We could see the CN tower lights at night! And the bathroom! The soaking tub was slightly oversized (I took advantage after a hard day of sightseeing) and the shower had a very cool rainforest showerhead - very relaxing! There was a nice-sized flat panel tv, wireless internet access, and in-room safe. Switches to turn all room lights were conveniently located next to the bed. And, I should mention, for extra security, you need to use your room key to operate the elevators. Unless you're a guest of the hotel, you cannot access the room floors. The advertised continental breakfast was yummy! Le Germain offered the usual danish and bread assortments and then bumped it up a notch with meats and cheeses, fresh fruit, and oatmeal. And the coffee! Available 24/7 is a coffee machine that I want to own - it made the best latte I've had in a long time! You could also choose espresso, etc, but oh, the latte!! And my husband loved the huge selection of teas. Getting around the city was very doable also thanks to the hotel. Located directly next to Union Station, public transportation was never a problem. The hotel doormen were always happy to help with cabs. And, if more convenient, the hotel also provides a car service which was available to drop us off and pick us up when we asked. For tourists, please know that the CN tower, Roger Center, Union Station, Steam Whistler Brewery, Longo's (a super-supermarket) and, of course, the Air Canada Center are all within walking distance. If you need help planning your activities, be sure to take advantage of the wonderful concierge service provided by Susan and Gregory!

After discovering the hotel about 8 years ago, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always enjoyed the amenities, the facilities, the rooms, the location, and especially the staff and service. During a recent trip to Toronto for business, I decided to try the new Hotel Le Germain Maple Leaf Square. Very impressed! The place is \u00e2\u20ac\u0153brand-spanking\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd new \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you can smell it when you walk into the modern and very cool lobby. I think there are still a few minor adjustments and bugs to work out, but, based on my experience, nothing that would keep anyone from booking now. In fact, I was so impressed, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve decided to book the Hotel again on our way through Toronto next week for a sun vacation. One of the great things is the location. I was a little skeptical at first, as the hotel seemed a little removed from the downtown core, being south of Front Street and north of the Gardiner. The hotel looked to be surrounded by the ever-growing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Condo\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sprawl along the lakeshore and a little isolated. It is not a problem. Since we always walk or use transit when we are in the city, Le Germain Maple Leaf Square is, in fact, in an awesome location. Located out the back-door from Union Station and across from the Air Canada Centre, accessing the city is a breeze. Simply walk across the street, enter the west side of the AC C and after a very short route through the indoor PATH hallways, you enter directly into the GO Concourse at Union. In a minute you have direct access to the TTC subway system. It was extremely convenient. Anyone thinking of taking in a hockey game at the ACC \u00e2\u20ac\u201c you couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t pick a more convenient hotel. The atmosphere and design of the new hotel follows the Le Germain style. Warm wood finishes, slate tiling, bamboo textured wall paper, clean lines, geometric patterns, soft lighting, and clever and unique design elements are throughout the hotel. There is a very cool metallic rope sculpture hanging in the Lobby. As you enter the elevators a simple pulsating sliver of light illuminates the floor in different colors. The ambiance is nice. The downstairs bar is spacious and a great place to unwind and have a drink. In the second floor breakfast room, LG Maple Leaf Square follows the tradition of providing an excellent high-end continental breakfast (included in the room price). Morning breakfast is one of the reasons we very much enjoy Le Germain. The automatic espresso/coffee machine, available to guests, is always well-used when we visit. Management seems to have incorporated all of the best features we appreciate in the design of their new rooms at their other Toronto hotel. I booked a Superior Room with a king bed. The room is a bit larger than the standard rooms on Mercer street. The windows run the full length of the room so there is plenty of sunlight \u00e2\u20ac\u201c I had a great view of the CN Tower and the Toronto skyline. A well designed desk area, and built-ins, run the full length of the room under the windows. It was great for working over the course of the two days. There is a recessed pod with accessible power outlets, and data and AV links. There are full privacy shades that fully cover the windows. Exterior noise was minimal. Opposite the bed is a wall component with a large built-in flat screen TV. To the side is shelving. (Note \u00e2\u20ac\u201c someone thought it would be a good idea to locate the one light switch for the main wall recessed lighting, inside the shelf, and hidden from view! It was a bit of a challenge to turn out the lights the first night when I was ready for bed. Although there is a convenient control centre beside the bed to turn out all the lights, this didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t solve the problem if you wanted to read. I was about ready to call down to the front desk to ask for directions to the light switch when I finally located it. Directing guests to this hidden light switch might be a good idea.) The beds, and bed linens are awesome \u00e2\u20ac\u201c soft full duvets, lots of pillows and perfect mattresses are first rate. We love the bedding at LG! And of course \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there is the bathroom. The dressing room, bath area and amazing rainforest shower stall are all very well laid out. The separate toilet is in a frosted glass enclosure, with whisper smooth rollers on steel tubing. The shaving mirror, glass basin, wooden vanity and large mirrored surfaces, stainless steel and tile (with bath robes ready for use) cover one area, and a dual glass-door closet and alcove for luggage, is accessible from the bedroom and the small hall. It is the central, glassed, walk-in shower stall, and the signature rainforest shower, that is so very impressive. The fixtures are ultra-modern and the overhead shower fixture is a huge squared steel plate that delivers a full-body rainforest-style shower (after a slight learning curve in figuring out the controls - you have to press the button on the right square tube and turn it to increase the temperature). If you require privacy there are full-slat wooden blinds to close off the glassed enclosure. There are full-bottle Molton Brown dispensers on the wall of the shower \u00e2\u20ac\u201c no tiny bottles to mess around with. The hotel is apparently not yet fully complete, but yet most of the services seemed available. There is a first-class fitness room with brand-new equipment, free weights, cardio machines, in a well-laid out area on the 4th floor. There is a computer terminal available on the second floor which I used for work \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it was seamless, with full printing and no waiting. I popped in my USB key and printed documents. A three hole punch was thoughtfully present for use. (Strangely, when I returned the next day, the computer had been relocated into the cupboard, and the USB access was gone. The front desk assisted in printing documents.) Le Germain is environmentally conscious \u00e2\u20ac\u201c there are large stoneware urns dispensing filtered water in multiple locations, with glass carafes in your room to refill as you wish. I very much like this feature. Although the web site seemed to be unclear as to the presence of a restaurant in the hotel, the new restaurant, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153e11even\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd is adjacent to the hotel and accessible through the lobby. Didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have a chance to try it out, but looks very nice \u00e2\u20ac\u201c extensive menu and the number of wines by the glass is impressive. There were a few minor glitches. There were none of the usual written materials in my room on the first two nights providing any info on services, dining, hours, room service etc. I had to extend my stay to a third night, and was in a different room, and there was at least the room-service menu on the desk. I assume the usual package of info will be forthcoming. They forgot to leave a bath mat on the second night \u00e2\u20ac\u201c not a big deal. The biggest issue was my malfunctioning phone when I switched rooms on the third night. The phones are cordless. As I was going to bed, I tried using the phone to call down for a wake-up call and discovered it was not functioning. After pressing the connect button \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the phone began an intermittent dial tone but then cut out and began to ring non-stop. Attempting to connect was futile as the dial-tone would kick out and the phone would again begin to ring. Hmmmm - not good. As it was midnight I did not feel like waiting for maintenance. The only option to stop the phone from ringing, was to unplug the phone, set my cell phone alarm and head to bed. However, at 5:05 a.m. the handset or phone then began beeping, waking me up a little earlier than I wanted to! I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t call down to confirm my transportation so I likely appeared a little cranky when I attended at the front desk. The fellow was very apologetic and helpful when I went down, and helped me grab a cappuccino. The phone issues may need to be looked at. I expect these are little things that usually have to be sorted out upon opening. I note from the prior review that another recent guest was not so lucky with his room! I agree that this is unacceptable. Definitely management needs to ensure that ALL rooms in their inventory that receive guests are fully ready for occupancy on their opening. Mine was (except for the phone on night 3) and from past experience, I am trusting that I won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be let down when I return again next week. Generally, it is the staff at Le Germain that we very much appreciate. We have always found that all of the staff at LG are gracious, helpful, friendly and very professional. The new hotel staff at LGMLS continues the tradition and they are very welcoming and accommodating. Although the hotel is larger and will likely be busier, there is still a genuine personal level of friendly service in all respects. Upon returning to my room the first night, the concierge team had left a tray with fresh fruit, crackers, a cheese ball and a maple spread, with a hand-written note. A nice touch. Overall, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d certainly recommend the new Hotel Le Germain Maple Leaf Square. This is on the strength of past experience and trust that the bugs will be ironed out. Le Germain appears to be continuing the tradition of classy, personalized, and high-end hotelier services, at fairly reasonable rates. I was very impressed with their latest addition. The only difficult thing now, will be deciding which Le Germain Hotel to return to when we visit Toronto.

The rooms are signature Le Germain, with a location specific touch (wall hanging is inspired by sports), the wonderful rain shower in the middle of the room and a switch system that allows you to set the lights to \"ambient\" or indicate whether you want to not be disturbed or the room to be cleaned. I like that each room always has two robes and an umbrella for guests to use.

Great location - right beside Air Canada Centre, walking distance to financial district and near the waterfront. Rooms are modern yet comfortable. Flat screen TV, work desk (free internet), cool layout - including showers with 360 degree view of room. Free continental breakfast included and it looks like they were getting ready to open a lobby bar. This hotel is located in a bigger complex that includes condos and retail, yet has its own entrance. There is easy access to a very nice restaurant in the complex plus one of the best rated sports bars in North America (RS Bar & Grill) that has over 150 flat screen TVs and a 2 story high-def TV \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a sports fans ultimate dream. There is also a Longos grocery store located in the complex where you can pick up lots of pre-made food. The service was fantastic from the door staff to the front desk staff to the breakfast staff. I would definitely choose this hotel for its location, modern conveniences and value.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Hotel Le Germain Maple Leaf Square", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g155019-d1940841-Reviews-Hotel_Le_Germain_Maple_Leaf_Square-Toronto_Ontario.html", "Price": "$237 - $453*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">75 Bremner Blvd</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Toronto</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">Ontario</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">M5J 0A1</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "1940841", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/02/23/c9/03/superior-room-bathroom.jpg"}}
