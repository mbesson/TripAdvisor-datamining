{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Great deal, conveniently located You cannot go wrong with this hotel.For a Western style hotel in Tokyo, the price cannot be beat. Try to book directly. Better yet, get a local to do it for you and I guarantee you'll get a better price.Service is impeccable. The rooms vary, some floors are obviously very recently remodeled, and others look like they're next on the to-do list. But every room was still excellent quality and reasonably spacious for a Tokyo hotel.Hotel has free internet. Bring a cable as they do not currently offer Wifi. Frequent guests will be overjoyed to hear that their Internet pipe was upgraded in the last couple of years.The hotel is right next to (practically on top of) the Otsuka station on the Yamanote line. Otsuka is a pleasant neighborhood with a mix of business and residential, and a decent assortment of restaurants. There are a few Western style eateries, but why bother, that's not why you came to Japan. If you must eat familiar food, head to Ikebukuro, one stop away on the Yamanote (120 yen one way).Being on the Yamanote line is all that matters. From there you can hit every major destination in Tokyo conveniently.", "Date": "Apr 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR824011920", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "SoCalFoodie"}, {"Content": "Very comfortable I and some friends stayed at this hotel for a good price which was to do with the air tickets we booked to Japan. I was very impressed; I don't normally stay at this class of establishment! Everything was spotless, porters helped us with our luggage, and the location was fairly convenient. Hardly anyone spoke English but it wasn't really a problem. Hideously expensive to have some laundry done, but at least it was done properly. Wish I could afford to live in the lap of luxury more often.", "Date": "Feb 20, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR706816260", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "BestPolicy"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u6c47\u4efc\u9288\u581b\u4e9c\u7f0d\u6d2a\u7c35\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(20368119, 'full');", "Date": "Sep 25, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR981282568", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "Author": "toshiaki"}, {"Content": "\u9287\u52e9\u4e9c\u9289\u6d96\u5110\u9289\ue0a0\u4ef9\u9287?#x201d;   showReview(19171338, 'full');", "Date": "May 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR244757472", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "lass="}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066460-d505316-r15328334-Hotel_Bellclassic_Tokyo-Toshima_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "505316", "Price": "Unkonwn"}}
