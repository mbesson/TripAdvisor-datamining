No air-conditioning really was a problem since we went in the summer and it was super hot that my friends couldn't sleep, they woke up soaked in sweat...We had to keep the windows opened but then my friend worried about out safety during the night...The bathroom was small but the shower was good. There's a computer in the room, surprisingly. It's a granny computer but it works fine with internet (would rather swap it with an air conditioner though) Location was its selling point to us, within walking distance to the city center. As we walked down the main street - Gran Via, we saw many hotel on both sides of the streets, all looked very grand. So I suppose for we couldn't find a much better choice given we were in budget. One thing to note, the reception is about 30 seconds walk from the rooms, on a different street. Just look for the sign \"JC rooms\" (a small black board hanging out of the building right opposite to the street where the apartment is).", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "2", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Liverpool, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cgreat location but bad quality\u201d", "Author": "Tyler L", "ReviewID": "UR134140879", "Content": "although the hotel is located right in the middle of city centre, its REALLY hard to find and the sign of the hotel is REALLY small. and the reception is not in the same building, and same, very hard to find. there is NO air conditioning in the room and Madrid is like boiling when we were there.

It's situated in a shady location. The rooms are on the second floor of an old building without any lift. The reception is in a different building, around 100 meters from the rooms. If one is planning to take the family, don't even dare to stay in this hostel. It's not even worth the free stay.

Stayed there for 2 nights, in a room with private bathroom. It was clean and comfortable and you even get some free drinks and yoghurts in the minibar upon arrival. The room is cleaned every day. The room is slightly small but that doesn't matter for those who are only in the room to sleep.. Perfect location; 2 minute walk from Puerta del Sol. Only negative point is that the walls are very thin so if people make some noise you will definitely hear it. I would definitely stay here again!", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Athens, Greece", "Title": "\u201cValue for Money\u201d", "Author": "islandhopper79", "ReviewID": "UR121932075", "Content": "12 rooms is located 150 meters from El Sol central square.

We were looking for central accommodation on the cheap but also wanted it clean etc. Faults: couldn't check in till two.

Massive room enough for four! Balcony, good shower, central as central can be. Nxt to a grocery store. Free water, coke and beer. Comfy beds, tv. Quiet. So we liked it as it fitted our bill.
