The bed was pretty comfortable, and there was a pull-out couch (we didn't use it). We slept very well. The only complaint was that the couch was difficult to sit in because the springs were shot, so it sank down really low. But really, it was no big deal. Nice bathroom with all the necessities.

Nice location, and spacious room, mainly due to the smaller bed size (not a king). The front desk clerk seemed to have an attitude from the time of check in. We arrived with friends who had a dog. Although the hotel offered pet rooms the dog was not ours, was not staying with us, and was not coming in our room. The clerk seemed rather over concerned with the dog, and so I made it a point to make sure the dog did not even come close to our room His careful eye, was rather uncomfortable. We were respecting the pet policy, and had nothing to make him assume we wouldn't. The following day of check out, he was prompt to notify us of the 11 am check out time. As I turned in my key I mentioned our bathroom sink was clogged and not draining, due to the latch coming off hooked from the drop stopper. The same front desk personal insisted on escorting me to take a look. I had picked up the room prior of any debris. Only the bed was unmade and I had placed the used wet towels in a pile under the sink so the maid could pick them all up together. When the Clerk noticed the towels he became very rude and condescending to me. He asked why i would throw them on the floor and why they were so \"filthy\". He picked each towel with his fingertips and a disgusted look on his face, inspecting it. I explained the tile bathroom floor was dirty (not from us) and the towels had justs soaked up some of the dirt. I told him it was nothing that wouldn't come out when washed. He began to insult me by saying I was dirty and do I throw towels on the floor in my own home. I explained I didn't understand the big deal and sarcastically asked if he wanted me to wash them for him. To my surprise he said yes and scooped them all up and handed them to me. I have yet to see if I have been charged on my credit card for incidental fees. I want to add, all the towels were obiviously old and used, very low end quality and the bath towels already had holes in them. The dirt on the towels was tracked into the tile bathroom from his hotel room carpet being dirty. I washed them in hot water and bleach as soon as I got home, and what do you know!? All dirt washed out. I plan on returning them to the hotel this week. regardless of condition of the towels and how they got that way, this hotel staff should be polite to any paying guest.

The funishings inside were a little tired, but we never plan on spending much time in a hotel room, so it didn't matter to us. This hotel was also amongst the lowest price we found in the area, so we didn't expect a palace. Unfortunately, our night was completely ruined by some irresponsible louts who returned to their room at about 1am and proceeded to shout and scream outside in the car park at the top of their voices until about 4am. We've stayed in motel style places before, and have been disturbed many times in the past but this noise was like nothing on earth. On three seperate occassions we tried to call the front desk to complain, but the phone line was permanently engaged (had they taken the phone off the hook?) In the morning, we complained at the front desk, and they were apologetic, but it was all too little too late. They explained that they had also heard the shouting and screaming from the other guests, but had assumed it was from another hotel...

The bed was as hard as a concrete floor and the blanket was stained with who knows what. It's a good thing I happen to have spare clean sheets in my car trunk because I was not touching the sheets and blanket on the bed. The carpet was dingy and was not clean when I arrived..there were crumbs. There was no table to sit at..the couch was so dirty it looked liked it was found at the city dump...the staff even covered the couch with a sheet to hide all the stains. I was not planning on cooking during my stay which was a good thing because there was nothing to cook with and there was a knob missing on the stove. There was one cup, one plate, and a tea kettle which had a layers of dust on it. There was hair on the kitchen faucet and on the bathroom floor, and also on 2 of the four towels. There were baby flies flying around and seemed to want to get out too because they loved sitting on the curtains. The curtains in my room were broken off from the hooks...the blinds were broken... the shower head was held on with tape and so was the towel rack. There was no hair dryer. There was an ironing board but no iron. The safe did not work. There were only 4 hangers and the bathroom window did not shut. The parking lot is very small and had to park on the street. I noticed that when the trash truck came to empty the bins a lot of the trash fell down onto my car and on another car. I left the room at noon and there was no maid service at all! Went out for a few hours and when we returned the parking lot was closed for a \"few hours\" and no one could go to their rooms for a \"few hours\" due to deliveries of beds to some of the room but no one was to enter their rooms for the \"few hours\" It's a good thing we took everything out of our room before we left for the day because our door was wide open when we returned! All the doors face the street and it was not wise for the staff to think leaving doors open and unattended was ok. The staff does not care properly for their guests and it is very obvious with the doors left wide open and rooms that are not maintained. The photos the owners post on their site are very misleading. Checked out right then and there...this \"inn\" which is really a low class motel is way below standards and my advice is to bring hand sanitizer because everything in the room is disgusting and dirty, I had to use a towel to cover the light switch because I did not feel comfortable touching the switch..it was grimey and sticky.

Wow was I surprised to find out our room was a suite! I was not expecting this, and it was a nice change from staying 2 weeks in other hotel rooms only (and for the same price). We stayed for 3 days (2 nights). I have posted video of our room so I guess you can find that in my profile. It was a nice suite, nice couch which pulled out to a bed, our queen bed was comfortable, decoration was nice, nice new windows all around, shower had good water pressure, full size fridge & stove and kitchenette. Our kitchen even had pots & pans, plates, bowls and utensils which had I known I would be in a suite would have been awesome! There was even an in room safe which was great! The marina was a block from the hotel and there was a Jack in the box across the street, KFC, McD's, and Denny's Restaurant really close by in walking distance. Not too far a drive away ( a couple miles) I discovered a Target store and Chillis Restaurant, Red Lobster, Black Angus and another nice BBQ restaurant. The airport was a short drive and there was no close airplane noises. The only thing in the room I personally would have liked would have been dark curtains for the two windows in the kitchen, the blinds let in too much light when trying to sleep and also one of the blinds wasn't long enough on one window as well. But other then that the suite was really nice. The Continental breakfast provided by the hotel consisted of boxed cereal and milk and orange juice and danish only which were individually wrapped so that was nice. We personally would have appreciated a 2nd juice being allergic to oranges and maybe a toast machine with bread or bagels, but having the cereal option for the kids was great! The free breakfast just was not the same scale as a couple other hotels we had been at but still better then 1 of them but the bonus of having the suite out weighted all the other places anyways. They were training a new front desk person when we arrived so I can't comment on the front desk service except that the guy doing the training on July 10 was really nice and professional! I did get annoyed one night with the people above us, I swear they were letting their kids jump up and down late at night and it sounded like a bunch of elephants. I felt so sorry for the maid, she looked young and was by herself to do the whole place - all they have is one small washing machine and one dryer for her to try and do all towels and linen in daily. I don't know how that is possible. I can't comment on the maid service either because I left a do not disturd sign on our door the whole time, which I'm sure she was grateful for. The parking lot is pretty small but it is a small hotel so what can you do...I counted 15 suites but only 11 parking stalls, + 1 Handicap space, so I could see if there was a full house parking could become a problem since the side streets were always full up as well but maybe not everyone comes with a vehicle so therefore parking might be fine. I notice they list 14 suites here, so maybe there isn't 15. I had no problems with my stay and would definitely stay there again if I had to stay in San Diego again. However I can see that they really need to come up with a solution with doing the hotel laundry -There is no room on the property to make a larger laundry area except maybe the little space at the back or maybe they should consider making one suite into a small single room and turning one of the kitchenettes and part of one suite into a decent size hotel laundry room so they can provide clean towels on a daily basis and clean the hotel bedding. At the very least they might be able to get two stacking washer/dryer combo's in the existing tiny laundry room - or prehaps out source their laundry (Maybe that is already what they do with the sheets??? I don't know...) I know I was beside their laundry room and all I ever saw was mounds of towels on top the one machine and no one around. But don't quote me anyways, for all I know they may have another laundry room they use on the upper level???

It was the weirdest thing I've ever seen. The next day we saw the owner of the car........she was a middle aged woman wearing just about every piece of clothing she owned, a big floppy hat, and a necktie around her face covering nose.
