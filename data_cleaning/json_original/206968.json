There are many things about the hotel that would be quite attractive if they were not tarnished by closely related flaws: -- The rooms and bathrooms are fairly large. Our room even had a little corridor or anteroom that was a useful buffer against noise in the hallway. And our double room was big enough for a king-size bed with room to spare. In fact, however, the bed consisted of twin beds pushed together. The headboard was king- or maybe queen-size, but each of the twin matresses had its own set of twin-size sheets, so my wife and I were really sleeping in separate beds. --The breakfast was diverse and tasty. But on the first morning, when I tried to make cappuccino on the self-service espresso/cappucino machine, the forced air did not produce any foam but instead sprayed coffee all over everything. Apparently the cappuccino part of the machine had not worked for a long time. Instead of apologizing, one of the waiters chastised me for trying to make cappuccino. He then said that if we wanted cappuccino we should have asked for it -- an option that had not been offered until that very moment -- and in a few minutes he did produce a couple of cups of good cappuccino, although he could not resist scolding us again. On subsequent mornings, several of the more senior waiters were hovering over us with impatient expressions in the apparent hope that this would make us leave the breakfast room soon. -- No facilities for making coffee or tea in the room. No iron or ironing board. Tiny and barely usable bathroom amenities including tangerine-flavored shampoo and kiwi-flavored body wash. -- The spa looks very nice from the outside. But it costs 10 Euros extra per day to use the exercise room, 20 Euros if you would also like to use the steam, sauna, and/or lap pool, so we did not find out what it looked like on the inside. -- Internet in the room is another 10+ Euros per day for the \"economy\" plan, 20+ Euros for the more useful \"business\" plan. But there's free wireless in the lobby, in 30-minute increments with coupons obtained from the front desk. -- Many of the hotel employees are just wonderful. The maids/housekeepers were awfully nice to us, as were the receptionists (but not most of the waiters) in the breakfast room and some of the younger front desk staff. But too many of their senior colleagues, like some of the senior waiters, seemed to consider themselves executive material and often behaved as if they would really prefer not to deal with customers. -- Like most everything else about the hotel, the location is OK but not great. It's several kilometers north of the city center, about a five-minute walk from the Cuzco subway stop, which is on line 10. Once you're on the subway it's about a twenty-minute ride to the Plaza Del Sol (including a change at Tribunal station that includes a long and labyrinthine walk). There are some pleasant restaurants in the neighborhood, including four that are right across the street from the hotel. But the neighborhood does not have the charm or the convenience of neighborhoods closer to the heart of Madrid. . --", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Astana, Kazakhstan", "Title": "\u201cneed transparency in charges\u201d", "Author": "MexKaz", "ReviewID": "UR129683639", "Content": "The place is very nice, although some parts of the facility look old and some equipment in the rooms.

Which only picks up in the morning and drops off the day after. And having checked the prices (10Euros a shirt, 9Euros for trousers) I will not consider that not to mention that I checked in mid afternoon - it will be cheaper to buy an iron and leave it here.

There were a lot of oddities and flaws, however. First, the internet connection was not functioning for the first night and following morning of my stay. A major business/conference hotel like this one needs a backup or on-site technician. Second, the design of the room was unusual. The wardrobe is in the bathroom! There is no coffee maker or clock. The lifts (elevators) are painfully slow, with long waits on upper floors. I am not one who takes much advantage of porters or concierge desks, but the absence of anyone to carry luggage or provide advice and special services is also a gap in a hotel of this kind. The conference room rate at this hotel was reasonable, but expect a no-frills experience at this example of the NH chain.", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ginevra", "Title": "\u201cOttimo\u201d", "Author": "BeppeGinevra", "ReviewID": "UR59079945", "Content": "I spent 5 days for a congress and i have truly enjoyed my stay.

The room was stylish and pleasant with a nice dressing area and all the facilities e.g. free safe. Bed was firm and comfortable. A little traffic noise. Be careful not to take a bottle out of the minibar as it is pressure sensitive and will autocharge your room although I can't imagine the hotel would actually bill you for something you didn't use. Decent hairdrier and complimentary extras e.g. a hairbrush, shaving kits. Although you have to pay extra to use, there were very good gym facilities and the spa was nice but a very small pool to actually swim in. They gave complimentary flipflops and swim caps along with a good range of toiletries on the ladies side - staff look after you.

The rooms are reasonably sized and well laid out, especially the bathroom/dressing area (a feature I have noticed elsewhere with this chain); external noise, at least from the 10th floor, was no worse than usual for central Madrid. The buffet breakfast was outstanding once you could find your way around (with juice glasses concealed under the juices themselves!)

Primary purpose of trip was a business meeting that took place in this hotel. We arrived the evening of Oct 2nd about 11:00PM. The front desk was not friendly at all. We received no information about the hotel or hotel services from the front desk. We had requested a king bed and when we arrived at the room it was 2 twins. After a call to the front desk we were told we could change the next day. The hotel furnishings look to be late 70's, early 80's contemporary. Rooms are somewhat dated and in need of upgrading. This hotel is for business travelers and business meetings. The hotel is located on the northside of Madrid. It is 3-4 blocks north of the Real Madrid Futbol Stadium. This area is a typical modern city area and seems to be safe. My wife & I walked to and from the Metro on several occasions late in the evenings and didn't have any uncomfortable moments. The hotel is 2-3 blocks from a Metro station. We traveled the Metro on several occasions without any issues at all. A 10-pass ticket is available for about 7 Euros. This is the most economical & easy way to get around Madrid. The Hop-On Hop-Off tourist bus makes a stop at the Real Madrid Stadium. 2-day pass is about 20 Euros. You can buy passes at virtually any newspaper stand and probably at your hotel. There is two routes, Historic Madrid and Modern Madrid. The best thing about this hotel for us was the breakfast buffet. It was very plentiful and good. An omelet chef was on duty and great selection of breads, fruit and meats. Self-serve espresso/cappucinno machine and great fruit juices available. They even had sushi for breakfast. Bottom line - Would we stay at this hotel again? Not if it was my choice.
