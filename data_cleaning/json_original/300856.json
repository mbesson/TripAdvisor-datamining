The suite upgrade was gorgeous (minus the ash on the coffee table and bed side cabinet (not the end of the world) we received a complimentary bottle of champagne started to open the bottle when the lights and air con went out. second time down to reception , third time an electrician came to the room (by this time it was past 11 pm) had the door wide open for 20mins trying to fix the lights (kills a romantic honeymoon mood completely) he left us his key as with the fixing he did our keys no longer worked.(strangely no one informed the Manager of these problems) The next day we went to reception to book a theater show (new day let's try and start fresh) nope the reception lady was annoyed about booking a show for us (and this continued for the stay) I can understand one or two people having a bad day but not all of the front desk ! (singapore flyer tickets same problem etc ) as if we where imposing on them. The club lounge was nice but have to wait a long time to receive breakfast .

However, that was the best thing about the hotel. Whilst it was ok, it was not a patch on it's sister hotel, the Pan Pacific Singapore which is where I normally stay. If the hotel was not in Singapore, you'd rate the service as being good. However it fell way below Singapore 4 & 5 star standards. I had a suite and whilst nicely furnished, it had seen much better days. It didnt even have a desk - I am a business traveller so this is important to me as I dont like working in the same room in which I sleep. The bed was rock, rock hard - my back ached for two days after leaving. Pillows were ok The Pacific lounge was nicely furnished/decorated. Canapes in the evening - well there were hardly any and what was there was very average so I didnt bother going the second night. Breakfast was quite nice although some of the staff left a bit to be desired. On my first morning (Saturday), a menu was shoved in my face and I was asked to make a selection while standing in the middle of the lounge, before I had even sat down!! He did the same to the guy who came in after me and he got really annoyed and barked at the server to let him sit down and consider it. Staff on the Sunday morning were excellent. Reception staff were efficient but pretty cold/unfriendly. The telephone service line took so long to be answered one night, I was just about to put the phone done in disgust when it was finally answered. The mineral pool was freezing - it was no wonder that no-one was out there - it was unuseable Whilst the weather was unusually cool for Singapore, the next hotel I stayed in, their pool was warm and useable so I suspect their filtration method makes the water cold. Would I come back - perhaps if I REALLY needed to be in this location again. I wouldnt bother with suite or Club room as it was a complete waste of money.

Unfortunately the fridge was leaking and the switches to the bedside are malfunction. Hence the General Manager wrote me an apology email promising to upgrade me to a Suite if I return again. After thinking it over and decided to give it a second chance, hence when I flew to Singapore again 2 weeks ago in December, I replied to the General Manager's email, informing him of my time and day of arrival. He replied promptly and said my room would be ready when I arrive. Unfortunately this is not the case, When I arrived in that morning, the Receptionist at the Check-in desk said my room was not ready even though I told him the GM promised the room would be ready HE even said the system did not show my previous stay's record in May this year. At one stage, he asked when I a local. Why would I stay in a hotel for three nights at more than $400 a night if I'm a local??? My advance hotel booking should showed I'm from Australia. To make matter worse, when I returned at 2p.m., at the Reception desk, I did ask HIM again whether I was getting the Suite as his GM promised, He replied 'Oh yes'. When I was taken to the room, I straight away recognised that was the same room I stayed and paid for previously (EXECUTIVE CLUB ROOM), not the Suite as promised. He must be thinking I could not differentiate an EXECUTIVE CLUB ROOM with a SUITE! I was really disappointed and feel cheated to lure back to stay at this hotel again, with promise not delivered. The worse part was on check-in, I was treated like a second class citizen as if I was lying to say your GM promised to upgrade me to a Suite. Then on departure day, as I paid for an EXECUTIVE CLUB ROOM, the check-out time can be at 3p.m. I did inform the desk that I would check-out at 3p.m. Guess what, when I returned from shopping at 2p.m., both my access card were rejected from entry into my room and my internet access was also disconnected!!!!

It was less expensive than the Hilton, and we booked on the Pan Pacific website to try it because we had good experiences at Pan Pacific Jakarta, Seattle, and Vancouver. Our room facing the Hilton across Orchard Road was not as large as rooms on the other side of the hotel. There was a small LCD TV on the wall, refrigerator, coffee-maker. We didn\u2019t try the restaurants, business center, pool, or fitness center. The bed was comfortable, and there was absolutely no neighbor noise or outside noise. Pros Good name of the hotel Quiet enjoyment Jason\u2019s supermarket is open 24 hours now Near some good restaurants such as La Strada in Shaw Centre. We didn't eat in the hotel,, and we know Pan Pacific usually has at least one great restaurant. This is in the pros section only because other reviewers observed that Orchard Towers, next door, was frequented by an anthology of pro\u2019s. In previous years we occasionally saw fanfares of strumpets entering the famous four floors of Orchard Towers, but they looked and acted no different from their colleagues that walk Orchard Road, and they never seemed out of order. We didn\u2019t see any Ladies of the Night on this trip, and we wouldn\u2019t fault the hotel if we did. Cons Rooms, lobby, elevators and halls are essentially the same as Meritus Negara Hotel, but for a higher price. Wi-fi in the lobby was complicated to access with an iPhone. Don\u2019t try to do it yourself. After I picked up a user name and password at the middle of three reception desks, a pretty and very patient waitress named Twinkle helped me set up my iPhone to use the free wi-fi in the lobby. In the shower, the hand shower is aimed at the door so often the spray gets between the door and frame, making the floor wet. Wired Internet access in the room costs extra, except if you are a member of GHA, which is free to join. No wi-fi in the room. If it\u2019s raining, it\u2019s a bit of a walk to the Orchard MRT station I mentioned to one staff member that I saw little difference, physically, from the old Meritus Negara, and she said a renovation is planned for early 2012.

The other is there seems to be a very dodgy concierge first he tried to sell us tickets to Universal Studios for $65 each and take our money on the spot when afterwards we found out its actually $85 each and we pay the company direct. We didn\u2019t trust him at all after that so we opted to talk to the other concierges because they helped us properly and were more honest about everything. Or we asked the receptionists for help and they were even more helpful. Other than those two problems we had a great stay here. Rooms were so comfortable and housekeeping was great. The spa/sauna/pool/gym area was great. Internet rooms were great and you\u2019re in a great location. Not in the middle of all the hustle and bustle but you are right by Orchard road and the MRT so it is easy enough to get places from there.

My flight arrived at Singapore passed midnight and we were very exhausted. After reach the hotel, there was only one receptionist present and unfortunately for us, she was attending another couple. So we patiently waited, but despite seeing us with luggage clearly indicating that we are guests, she did not even call in for help. So we have to wait for another 20 mins until finally another staff showed up and asked us \u201cwhat can I do for you?\u201d The check-in process took over 40 mins, despite I presented her all the original printouts I received from Flight Center, she insisted that I should have another set of document to give her. I told her this is all I have\u2026 eventually she said that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s between the hotel and flight center, they will contact the flight center to get the document\u2026 (Thank goodness, shouldn\u2019t you think of that when we first said these were all we received from the Flight Center?) Gave her my credit card details, no problems at all (you think? Problem came later). However, it was not until we traveled to our room to found that the room has twin bed configuration, instead of one queen size bed. Despite being really tied, we went down stairs to ask if there was a mistake. We were told our booking was for twin beds (that's fine, Flight Center made an error) but when I asked if I could get an upgrade. She straight away replied no (without even checking the availability first). We said we were willing to pay extra to get an upgrade, she insisted that they don\u2019t have any room. I asked her how about tomorrow, she insisted that they were fully booked during our entire staying period. After getting back to the hotel room, I checked their online booking system, Da Da, rooms with queen size bed available on that exact day and through out our entire stay in this hotel. I called the front desk to inform them such \u201cnews\u201d, they blamed that the system was not up-to-date, and eventually told us that they could change us into a queen size room tomorrow but it would be much smaller\u2026 so we stayed in the twin size bed room for the entire stay. Anyway, several days later, when I checked my online credit card transactions, it showed that the hotel charged me couple hundred Australian dollars. First I thought it was the room service, so didn\u2019t pay much attention. On my check out, they asked me to sign for the room service and buffet dinner, which are all fine, usual procedure. But then when I was at the airport using their free wi-fi service, I discovered that the room service and buffet dinner have showed up as separate payments on my online statement. I called the hotel using my mobile (on roaming) to ask what was the couple hundred dollars for? They couldn\u2019t provide me a decent answer. They first insisted that the payment was for the room service and buffet. But I was able to show them that the room service and buffet were charged separately (by given them the exact Singapore dollar amount). They then said because it\u2019s a Friday they can\u2019t tell me what was the money charged for and I need to wait until Monday to contact them again. I told them I\u2019m physically in the airport and will fly back to Australia today... Apart from their promise to solve this problem as soon as possible, no real answers received. The amount showed up in my credit card statement for over a week. Couple weeks later, finally received an e-mail from the Hotel stating that the amount was in fact a \u201cdeposit\u201d for the anticipated cost that I MAY incur. I\u2019ve been staying in many five star hotels around the world and this is the first time I ever been charge a deposit without my knowledge. If they were in fact deposits, then why were my meals charged separately at the end? Shouldn\u2019t they be deducted from the deposit? Especially, How can a hotel make charges on my credit card without my signature or pin?

I have never encountered such rude and shocking service in my life. The front desk staff are surly and sullen, I do not think they realize they are working in hospitality! I have broken it down by Service, Hotel Location and Room. Feel free to contact me via TA if you want any further info: SERVICE: Check-in was with Najal or Najar, no smile, no welcome, or hello. During our entire interaction there was barely any eye contact she spoke to the computer screen the whole time. We were checking in at 9pm so thought it may have just been a long day for her. We used the pool facilities on the 2nd day and my fianc\u00e9 stayed behind to use the gym while I returned to the room and did not realize you need a swipe card between that floor and the rooms (sometimes you only need a card from reception not within the hotel). He went down to reception and got Najal/Najar again, and explained the situation and asked for a temporary card. She asked \u201cwhat is your room number\u201d and when he told her she looked at her computer and replied \u2018you check out tomorrow\u2019. Okay...that\u2019s great \u2013 does that mean he can wait until we check out tomorrow? She then handed him a card without looking up, ahh it was just a blunt comment to make rather than actually being nice or making conversation. On the 3rd day I checked my emails for the hotel confirmation as I did not want to ring down and deal with them to confirm checkout time for the 4th day. My reservation email confirmed a guaranteed late check-out of 3pm (I just checked and this is also emblazoned across the official website). On our way out I stopped by the front desk and spoke to Danielle. I asked her to check our checkout time please. She checked and replied 12pm. I said (and I was being overly friendly too, just to compensate for their sourness) my email said 3pm. She rolled her eyes and looked on the computer and said deadpan \u2018I can give you 2pm\u2019 and types it without any acknowledgement from me. I replied \u2018I can go and print out the email, my reservation says 3pm?\u2019 and she said bluntly \u2018the latest anyone gets is 2pm, we have to charge if you stay past 2pm\u2019. I felt like she was calling me a LIAR. By now I would have looked annoyed and told her I will go use the business centre and print out the email as proof. I found it completely unprofessional to not honour a confirmed reservation - I did not even request it the late checkout, it was an incentive to book on the official website! I may as well have booked through Wotif and saved a bit of cash. She then replied \u2018fine its 3pm\u2019 typing on the computer without any eye contact and then kept looking on her computer. No \u2018anything further I can help with, apologies for the misunderstanding\u2019, no acknowledgement. It was like I did not exist standing in front of her! I could not believe this is the service at a 5 star hotel. Every single exchange with the front desk staff left a sour taste in my mouth. I am dreading checkout this afternoon, AT 3PM! My fianc\u00e9 and I were discussing this in the lift and another guest agreed, the service here is abysmal. LOCATION: A 5mins hilly walk RIGHT to Scotts Rd (you end up next to Royal Plaza on Scotts \u2013 which I am kicking myself we didn\u2019t book as it was the same price) and then 2mins to Orchard Rd. Or a shorter 3min walk LEFT direct to Orchard Rd but through sex shops and massage parlours. Definitely not recommended for families with kids or older guests. For the same 5mins walk but cheaper, I would recommend the York Hotel which has been completely renovated and although still a hilly walk it\u2019s a quiet driveway through a park, and not via a road used by taxis or a red light district building. There is a free shuttle provided by the Paragon shopping centre that takes you down to the heart of Orchard Rd but it\u2019s a 25min trip and stops at other hotels, hardly convenient. ROOMS: The size is decent, but feels like a light refurbishment rather than a full renovation. The carpet smells musty, the bathroom still shows its age. The furniture is dark and the walls are stark white, they would have done well to paint it some warmer colours or at least have one picture or painting. There is a small CRT tv and no dvd player. Feels like a 3 star hotel, nothing 5 star about it. No wifi, but free broadband if you sign up as a Pan Pacific member at reception. Gym facilities are fine, the pool area needs renovating, pool chairs are looking tattered. Spa and sauna area is clean. There is nothing that would compel me to ever stay or recommend the Pan Pacific Orchard to anyone. There are too many other hotels around that actually appreciate their guests. For the 5 star prices you can get a lot better around the Orchard Rd area. And if money is an issue, Singapore has such an efficient MRT service, as long as you stay close to an MRT and then take an MRT directly into Orchard, you will end up in a shopping centre faster than staying at the Pan Pacific Orchard. Every other hotel we stayed in the last 2 weeks were fantastic or if there were some losses had some redeeming features that would make me return. The Pan Pacific Orchard location and rooms are not good enough to warrant such average service. For the crappy service and basic rooms we may as well have been in a 3 or 4 star business hotel.

It took us about 25 minutes. The hotel is just off Orchard Road so within a two minute walk we were in the heart of shopping. PPO is located at the top (or bottom end?) of Orchard Road so it was really good to start at one end, cross over and do the other side- not that you could possibly do that in one day to see all the shops.

Our room was extremely clean with two single beds (as requested on Wotif). Our rate included buffet breakfast which was really extensive, catering for all food needs. There was plenty to choose from and the staff were most efficient and quick with service. The foyer/restaurants were very modern and well maintained. The breakfast really set us up well for the full days we had and we really didn't need to eat again until dinner. The bathrooms were great with shower and bath, with well stocked bathroom extra's. A tip here, if you joined up with the Hotel Club (free) you got free internet in your room during your stay, which was a real bonus as its normally charged out at S$5 per hour. Once on Orchard Road, there were bus stops all along. A couple of times, we hoped on any bus that came by (as they all travel down the full length of Orchard Road) and hoped off about 2 - 3 stops down. It made it easier in the heat to get to new shops. We purchased a three day Singapore Pass which was excellent value. For S$8 per day, we hoped on any bus or train we wanted and we used it often. There may have been a cheaper option but hey, for S$8 for a whole day in this city, I was not going to go hunting anything else down to save a couple of bucks. You just swipe on and off and travel where ever you want. We purchased ours from the ticket office at the ION station. It came with a handy map. The closest MRT station was at the ION station which we got to just across the road (via the underpass). The MRT was exceptionally easy to understand, and if lost, there were easy to find information counters and the staff spoke excellent English and their directions were great. The trains come by every few minutes, the longest we waited was perhaps 6 minutes. The system was very well run and the trains were exceptionally clean and had a safe feel to them, no matter what time of the day or night. ION shopping was excellent and we shopped there a lot. It had all the main shops you find anywhere in the world and we felt prices were similar (perhaps slightly cheaper) than Australia, however an enormous selection. There were probably cheaper places to go, but in the 34 degree heat, we were happy to stay in the malls which were well air-conditioned. We did the Hop On Hop Off tour which was fantastic, S$23 pp. There was a stop for this about 300 metre walk from the hotel. We did the full Orange route, then hopped off and did the full Red route. It was an excellent way of getting to know the locations. As it was so hot, one afternoon we decided to stay in and have a few hours at the pool and work on our tan. The pool was great with nice sun loungers, but the sun goes in the opposite way to Australia and the sun had gone behind the building by 1pm so no tanning was done, even though it was over 30 degrees! :-( If I was to return to Singapore I would definitely stay back at the PPO and I highly recommend it as a very good 4 - 41/2 star hotel.", "Date": "October 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Penrith, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cOK, but not a hotel I'd choose again\u201d", "Author": "5StarAirline", "ReviewID": "UR84309048", "Content": "I chose this hotel because it was supposedly on Orchard Road close to the main shopping areas. It isn't far, but there are closer hotels to the main action (e.g. Marriott). The Pan Pacific is located near the end of the Orchard Road shops a couple of blocks from the main shopping area, and is on the road behind and parallel to Orchard Road. It isn't a long walk at all to the main shopping area (perhaps 5 minutes) but you need to walk through an area of sex shops and prostitutes. My Dad (who is retired) was asked if he wanted business after returning to the hotel one evening! I heard a number of other guests also discussing this in the lobby. That said, I never felt the area was unsafe and I'd have no problem walking back to the hotel, even late at night. My biggest issue with this hotel is the comfort of the mattress and the quality of the linens. The mattress feels very thin and is very hard. I don't know if it is an orthopaedic mattress, or just a cheap one, but either way I didn't really enjoy my sleep each night. The beds are made so the sheets don't quite tuck into the foot end properly, so each morning I found the sheets pulled messily pulled from the bed and myself tangled up in them all with the mattress exposed. Overall, not the sort of bed I dream of coming home to and snuggling down into. Lobby is a pleasant place to have a drink (drinks are very expensive though) and breakfast buffet was good. However, on all the days I was at the hotel, the hotel was hosting conferences or accommodation for a number of large business groups. Whilst these presented no problem in terms of noise or inconvenience, it did ruin the ambience somewhat to see big groups of business associates hanging around as I was on holiday and wanted to forget about business. The hotel is decorated in dark wood and gold - quite colonial in feel. Lifts are fast and efficient, never had to wait. It has a small almost boutique feel to the place. Spa looks awesome - very plush, and the mineral water swimming pool was nice as there is no chlorine in the water. However, I was not so impressed with the actual spa treatment itself. The lobby of the spa and demonstration room looked very plus and impressive, but the treatment room I was assigned was a bit tatty and basic. Also, the actual massage itself was not so good. Internet in the rooms is via cat5 cable only (no wi-fi) but it is nice and fast. 4Mbps average download and 10ms ping. Wi-fi is available in the lobby but you need to get a voucher from front-desk to use this. They gave me free vouchers but said each time it should normally be chargeable as it is separate from the room Internet charge. Overall, because of the uncomfortable beds and poor linen, I would not recommend this hotel unless it was significantly cheaper than others in the area.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Carnarvon, Australia", "Title": "\u201cAbsolute pleasure.....Fantastic\u201d", "Author": "Dicksy61", "ReviewID": "UR84031866", "Content": "My wife and I stayed at the PanPacific Orchard for 5 days and I have to say it was an absolute pleasure.The staff are very informative , friendly and only too willing to help in any way.

The room itself was small but clean enough. Very basic for the price. The air-conditioning unit fluctuated and got warm in the evening. The location is a bit misleading because it is not actually on orchard road but on an adjacent street. It was near shopping areas but you have to walk pass by what the taxi driver called \"hookers hotel\" or something like that.

The fish sticks had that bad fishy taste that left a bad taste in my mouth. The bellhop was friendly enough though.

Actually, I had reviewed some of the bad comments of it but I still had hopes on this hotel. However...... I have stayed at this hotel on 18/3 to 21/3. (3 days). When I arrived at this hotel at about 4pm, there was a lady (I think she's an Indian) serve me at the front desk. When I gave her two Invoices (one is 18-20/3 twin bedroom without breakfast and 20/3-21//3 with double bed and breakfast), she told me that there's no double bed at all. She also said that the invoice indicated I only had twin bedroom. I asked back that another invoice had indicated the double bed room so far. So, I requested to stay one night then changed the room. She took me a long long time to search it and she seemed on dream..... Another staff (she may be a Singapore lady) told me that she would try to arrange a double bed room for me but I should wait about 1-2 hours. In fact, we didn't mind to wait it. After 2 hours later, the Singapore staff gave the room key to me. However, when I asked her I should have breakfast on 21/3, she told me that she had not received the invoice of 20-21/3. When she asked the Indian staff, the Indian staff told that she had returned the invoice to me and she had not got it. I felt very angry and I was sure that she had received it. She denied on it so far. The Singapore staff asked me to search myself and they still defensed on receiving the invoice. After a moment, the Singapore staff found that the documents had such invoice and she arranged it immediately. However, what disappointed me?? It's the Indian staff left then without saying sorry on her lies while the Singapore staff was the same. They ignored this incident and only gave me the room key that's all. I felt extremely angry and I told the Singapore staff about my disappointment. However, she only replied \" Do you want the Indian to say sorry to you, OK, wait\" See, this is this HOTEL SERVICE.

This is particularly important to us as we do laundry regularly, and like to have this thrown into the package. Upon check-in to the hotel, we received a welcome letter which outlined all the privileges of the Pacific Club room, and what we were entitled to. The letter listed that we were (quote) \"entitled to 2 pieces of laundry, non-accumulative\". So straight away we sent for 2 pieces of dirty laundry to be laundered. The laundry came back with a cost attached, so we rang reception and questioned them about this. Front desk said that club privileges was only for clothes 'pressing' - but this was NOT was we read in the letter. We were so furious we decided to show them the letter we received upon arrival - and funnily enough (and very handy for them), housekeeping had decided to throw this letter away from our desk - which was laid out in the middle of the desk. Bewildered we asked reception to send the letter up again - and guess what, the letter had been amended, even the way they addressed us in the letter was different. We mentioned that this is a different letter - and they said this is the standard letter they give out to all people. Why we remembered this was different is because the original letter ''welcomed'' us ''back'' to the hotel - we thought this was strange as we've never stayed at this hotel before. This left a VERY sour taste, and we will never stay or recommend anyone to stay at this hotel.

The room stank from the insect spray and I asked if we could be moved as my wife would severly react to the spray due to her asthma.

We could not however take him up on this offer as my wife was ill for 2 days and was unable to leave the hotel and could not eat very much we had to order in toast to the room as this was all she could palate.During my wifes time in the room the phone rang at the most inconvenient times both day and night when I contacted reception on more than one occasion re this was advised no-one had called the room !!! On the morning of our check out my wife went to finalise the bill whilst I waited for a cab outside to go direct to the airport, she noticed a suited male hovering behind her while she was settling up once she had completd this he approached her and advised he was Justin the hotel Manager and wanted to know if everyting was well with our stay, my wife just wanted to get out of there as she was not fully aware of my complaints to the staff. Why did this Manager not approach myself and why did he wait until after the bill was settled to make any enquiries I complained on the Tuesday and did not check out until the Friday !!!!

We booked a Pacific Club Executive room but were kindly upgraded to a Pacific Club Suite for the entire duration of our stay, free of charge. Free breakfast was included in the hotel\u2019s Club Lounge as well as free internet access in our suite. Also, free daily use of the business center computers for one hour was offered to us during our stay. Before I begin my review of the hotel, a couple of notes about the circumstances of my travel to Singapore: 1) I went to Singapore for vacation, but also needed adequate arrangements for work; 2) I am a young, 26-year old traveler who stayed at the hotel with his 75-year old grandmother; 3) we paid a pretty penny for a week at the Pan Pacific Orchard, and as such, expected the quality of our stay at the hotel to conform to the amount of money that we spent during one week at the Pan Pacific Orchard. Overall Summary: Over the next few paragraphs I will be detailing why I think you should stay at a different hotel if the circumstances of your travel to Singapore are similar to those of mine, but also be giving information about the bright spots of my stay at the Pan Pacific Orchard. The bottom line is that you should not be fooled by the name \u201cPan Pacific\u201d on this hotel, as the Pan Pacific Singapore, located on 7 Raffles Rd., is far superior in reputation and execution to the Pan Pacific Orchard location. And I won\u2019t even go into detail about the horrendous case of bed bugs that I contracted during my stay at the hotel, which left me covered in hundreds of tiny red bumps, itching, and slathered in Hydrocortisone cream during my entire stay in Singapore. Staff: Let it be known that the staff at the Pan Pacific Orchard hotel is absolutely top notch. They are kind, personable, and professional on an individual level. The problem, however, is that the Pan Pacific Orchard is dreadfully understaffed, and simple requests for ice, towels, coffee, tea, electrical converters, or the like, were often addressed thirty minutes after calling down to the receptionist. Most of my calls down to the receptionist needed follow up calls, which during a stay in a \u201cfive star\u201d suite is unacceptable. I understand that this may have been due to the hotel being understaffed, but truthfully it is the onus of the hotel owners to hire enough staff members to keep high paying customers happy. That said, I can\u2019t put any fault on any of the staff members individually. They were all very nice and did their best, given the circumstances. From the receptionists to the cleaners I felt welcomed. Food in the Club Lounge: Most of my week was spent eating out, but I did enjoy free breakfast at the Club Lounge every morning, as well as free afternoon cocktails during the afternoon and free drinks and snacks throughout the entire day. The made to order breakfast at the Club Lounge was perfectly fine. My grandmother is quite particular when it comes to her Eggs Florentine, so she griped a little bit, but I did not have any problems with the food. The eggs were hot and delicious, the bacon was crispy, and the cold fruits and salads all tasted fresh and clean. During my week at the hotel I had bread, eggs, jams and jellies, muesli, fruits, salads, teas, and juices, and they all tasted spectacular. The staff in the Club Lounge was wonderful and always had a collective smile on its face. I will say though that you should not expect high quality cocktails during the evening time in the Club Lounge. Very basic drinks may be okay, but anything else and expect a very subpar drink. 10 at Claymore Restaurant: During our last night at the hotel, my grandmother and I ate at the 10 at Claymore Restaurant, located to your left after walking into the hotel. The drinks were made proper, and the food was acceptable, but the temperature control on the meat, poultry, and fish seemed out of control. What I mean is that meat dishes would be inconsistent with regard to heat, which makes a meal taste terrible. One side of the buffet line would have super hot food, while the other side would have food that was supposed to be hot, but was in fact lukewarm or even cold. This isn\u2019t a good touch for the restaurant and left quite a foul taste in the mouths of my grandmother and I. The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was the staff, which was in fact the only redeeming quality of the entire hotel. The Location of the Pan Pacific Orchard: If you have small children, are a young couple looking for a nice area for your Singapore night activities, or travel with your grandmother (!), do NOT book your stay at the Pan Pacific Orchard. True story: the Pan Pacific Orchard is located directly next to Orchard Towers, infamously known as the \u201cFour Floors of Whor...\u201d all throughout Singapore. Absolutely every single night that you walk out of the Pan Pacific Orchard hotel at 7PM, expect to see massive numbers of pimps, prostitutes of all nationalities, and transsexuals. Funny enough, I don\u2019t necessarily have a problem with prostitution in and of itself, but had I known that my grandmother (!) and I would be staying ten paces away from lines of bars and prostitutes, I would have never agreed to stay at the Pan Pacific Orchard. This is not a family friendly location at all. Do not bring your young children for a walk at night around Orchard towers unless you are happy talking to them about sex at an early age. On two occasions gentleman brought their prostitutes into the Club Lounge at the hotel, which was completely not acceptable to me; not because I think they shouldn\u2019t have rights to use the lounge, but because It\u2019s quite unsettling to stay in a supposedly upscale location with your grandmother and see women in skin tight skirts eating breakfast next to you. Not cool. Our Room: All in all, the room wasn\u2019t anything to write home about, other than to tell my family and friends that I came down with a massive case of bed bugs at an upscale hotel. Our suite had two TVs, two rooms that could be separated by a sliding door, one bathroom, one shower, a min-bar, and a couch. The beds were very old and uncomfortable, as well as the couch. The shower, on the other hand, was a wonderful experience. While you should expect to have to ask over and over for more soap and shampoo, the actual shower experience was a pretty good one. Water pressure was high and heat stayed consistent throughout the shower. Watch out though, as your shower will invariably create a large puddle of water in front of the shower door. Place a large towel in front of your door so you don\u2019t slip. The toilet was alright; nothing amazing, really. As I said, for the price that my grandmother and I paid, the room was really nothing to write home about, which is primarily the reason I will not be staying at the hotel again. It\u2019s not as though I dislike the people who work there, but the operation as a whole is just missing a few screws, and the hotel is old and run down. Put it this way: I\u2019d be willing to stay at the Pan Pacific Orchard for much cheaper rates. So there you have it. I have attached photos to this review. Remember: the staff is great; but the poor execution of the hotel running smoothly, the seedy location, and the bed bugs just broke the deal for me. I won\u2019t be staying at the Pan Pacific Orchard ever again, and after my stay at the Raffles location, know that the Orchard location doesn\u2019t deserve to have the \u201cPan Pacific\u201d branding on its outside walls.", "Date": "April 4, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "2", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "2", "Check in / front desk": "2", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cDisappointing\u201d", "Author": "Knight59", "ReviewID": "UR22971033", "Content": "We stayed at the Pan Pacific Orchard for our 22nd wedding anniversary for a week in October 2008.We visit Singapore twice a year and mostly stay at either the Hilton or Pan Pacific (Marina).They are very good hotels.This time we thought we would try the Pan Pacific Orchard.We were disappoined.From check-in (no smile or greeting) to the dated furniture and carpets in our executive suite.The only positive was the attentive staff in the club lounge.We were also somewhat surprised that the ladies of the night were plying their trade just 50 metres from the hotel.Unless Pan Pac Orchard lifts their game substantially we won't have an ocassion to stay there.", "Date": "December 23, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "2", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanghai", "Title": "\u201cService Attitude is an issue\u201d", "Author": "JunianSH", "ReviewID": "UR22823922", "Content": "The location of the hotel is fine, next to Orchard Rd (shoping paradise).
