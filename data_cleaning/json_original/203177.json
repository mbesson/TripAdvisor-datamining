Congress payed for the first 5 days, I payed for the weekend. Trouble started as soon as we arrived as our reservation, as well as others from the group was not found. they seem not to have a working system other that papers scattered all over the front desk, very disorganized. and this meant wasted time for everybody. We would have changed hotel on the spot, but it was payed for so we were stuck here. So we tried to argue with the staff, and see if we could get their help on the room issue, NO!, we can't, we don't know, talk to the manager (who conveniently was never there)...I even got a \"Sir, shut up\" from one of the front desk employees. This went on daly, as we kept on trying to get an answer from anybody, no luck. When we changed rooms (required because of the 2 different reservations explained at the beginning), they gave us a Junior suite, apparently as a compliment for our troubles......needless to say I got charged for the upgrade on my check-out, no explanation, just pay or we call the police (literally), and again no one could get hold of the manager. I am waiting for my credit card bill, as I would not be surprised to find further charges made without my authorization.... As for the rooms: We could not be more disappointed: seriously out dated, smelly, dark and I suspect not as clean as it should be. Cable was bad, wireless cost 8 euro, breakfast was well below par, safe did not work, and the bathroom door knob was broken and I got locked in for 1/2 an hour until my wife came back from the lobby. I complained and got an empty look from the desk clerk. I travel frequently, and try to be realistic as to what i get vs what I pay for, and I must say I have rarely felt so disappointed and cheated as I was during my unfortunate stay here. The flaws of the place could have been overlooked if I had gotten a decent treatment from the hotel's staff, but the Horrifying service is what led me to write this review, so maybe others will be spared of the terrible experience.

One train stop takes you into the city where you can walk right down the Via del Corso to everything. The breakfasts do leave a bit to be desired, but are adequate. Again, you need to request real coffee, unless you are satisfied with the Nescafe from the machines (and many are). The waitstaff is very grateful for a euro or two when they bring the coffee and will have it for you the next morning.

The fabric was coming away in many places and it's just utterly oppressive. It's like being an an old Hammer horror movie. I half expected a bat to be trying to get in through the window.... It seemed to be full of tour parties and maybe they're happy with such squalor but I'm not. It's NO WAY a 4 Star hotel by the standards we expect for that these days (just scrapes by with a 3, at the very best) although when it was brand new I imagine it may well have lived up to it's rating. The last night we were there the lobby stank of the drains too.... I travel a lot, and sometimes you come across a place (just occasionally) that you want to warn everyone about - This is it. I've been home for less than 2 hours and feel it's my duty to ensure nobody else ends up in this miserable dump. If you're on a budget there are many other options in Rome for clealiness and location. This hotel really, truly has nothing at all endearing at all about it. It's stuck in an age which is long since past, and only a full renovation program can save it. Frankly, I'd rather sleep on the streets than go near the \"Ritz\" again.... If anyone pictures of this place, feel free to contact me.

The room was warm and wonderful with mirrors and many bordeau curtains. Super for a romantic night. Also wonderful to sleep there. Logical prices in minibar and restaurant. The room could be renovated a bit more however, since on the website it says last renovation on 2004, but it does not seem like this ( walls, locks, taps of the basin). Breakfast very good, and very clever staff and good hearted. I would certainly go there again although the hotel was not centrally located, because it was so beautiful, and I passed so well. The first morning I wake up too late and I lost the breakfast hours, and they gave to me breakfast in the bar without paying. I liked this a lot, not for the 5 euros I earned, but because they were very polite to me. The only bad thing was that I payed a lot of money for the phone, so do not make phone calls from the hotel. They do not have wireless internet. They have PCs in the lobby (6 euros per 8 hours). The location is very beautiful with shops and restaurants. The hotel is beside the Station Euclide.

We asked if we were checking into the right place based on our reservations - they said yes. We were escorted to our room by an unfriendly porter. The room was tiny, dark, run-down, ugly and had a flourescent light on the ceiling. The curtains were ripped from the rod, the security lock didn't work, the bathroom door didn't close, and the view from the window was of a huge metal container which blocked daylight. It was like the Bates Motel from Hitchcock's Psycho. Plus, our reservations said GRAND HOTEL RITZ, not Hotel Regent. What a dump!! We explored and realized we were placed in the worst side of the hotel - the other side (Hotel Ritz) wasn't much better but the rooms were a little nicer. We complained - were shown another bad room (no lamp shades, only bare bulbs, and the porter said he couldn't find any shades!), and declined and went to the front desk again. We showed them the internet photo (which looked nothing like the real rooms) and demanded a better room. After 10 minutes of waiting for the rude and arrogant front desk staff we were told they made a \"mistake\" and we were given a top floor room, much nicer, (the shower, however, was exactly 30 inches square) with a panoramic view of the city. We were smarter Americans than they assumed, we realized it was a bait and switch scam, and we had to be pushy and demanding to get our correct room!! The breakfast was typically European (lunchmeat,cheese, hard rolls) and was served in a huge ballroom type area. It was like a mess hall in an army barrack. Upon leaving, the front desk pulled a fast one on us: we asked to be picked up at 6:00 a.m. by a taxi for the airport. They insisted we be picked up at 5:45 a.m. When we got into the taxi we learned the \"day rates\" start at 6:00 a.m. and we were being charged the considerably more expensive \"night rates\" for the difference of 15 minutes. We demanded the driver give us the cheaper rate and he did. The ONLY good things about this hotel are the following: great neighborhood - upscale, safe, very good access to public transportation into the city (train station right outside hotel door) and good little bars and a good restaurant called Pastarito.

They do brilliant ice-cream as well!! The location was right next to the Euclide tram/train station, which is just one change from Flaminio Metro stop. Best to look up the times of departure during evenings as train/tram are infrequent (every 30 mins) and very crowded.

The connection to the center is relatively easy, although it implies either a commuter + undergrund trains or totake a bus, which in the chaotic Rome implies half an hour of tedium guaranted.

First the good things: The hotel is situated in a decent area with the Metro downstairs, which allows good access to most areas (as long as you are ok with some walking, it's fine). Some restaurants and shops are nearby but you will have to take the train to really get out of the residential area you're in. The hotel is generally clean and tidy and you won't have any problems with critters. Room size is decent and we whd no problems with safety. Now the bad: NOISY!!! If you want to experience what it feels like to have a garbage truck drive though your room in the middle of the night, stay at the Hotel Ritz. This place is by far the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in and I'm not a sensitive sleeper. Whether it's cars driving by or people talking outside, it makes no difference if your windows are open or closed. The noise level is all the same. After the first night, all three couples that were travelling with us all bought ear plugs - they were all in different rooms and were all disappointed about the noise, and it was still noisy. Also, our bathroom shower had the dumbest design ever. It had this water shield at the edge of the tub that was supposed to block any splashes from getting out of the shower area. Problem is, the shield was not sealed at the bottom so as water would splash against the screen, it would just flow to the bottom of the glass and leak out. I swear, by the end of each shower, there was major flash flooding in our bathroom. Everynight my wife and I had to use all of the towels in the room to keep the bathroom from filling up with water. Also, the floors are tile and I damn near broke my neck in there walking through. Finally, the cost is ridiculous. We paid 219 euro per night and this place wasn't even up to par with chain MOTELS here in the US. To top it off, as we were checking out, the front desk was so disorganized, they didn't have any record of our length of stay or that we had paid already. We had to present them with the receipts that they gave us when we checked in to prove that we really checked in when we did and paid. In the whole mess of waiting for them to work it all out, our cabbie was outside waiting and just the wait costed us 11 euro on the meter. All in all, the place was kind of a disaster and I would look elsewhere unless you can get a killer deal. At $250 USD per night, it's robbery.
