Very friendly staff. Ms Ira kindly assisted during our stay.

The room was not what it looks like on the photos on the website. It was very dark, with 1 window looking out onto a pathway.the prices for drinks at the hotel are silly compared what you get on the streets. the beach that you walk to is terrible. So to get to Kuta beach it takes a while", "Date": "Nov 22, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR200784857", "Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "Monkeypalace"}, {"Content": "Nice Stay We only stayed here because we were unable to get a room at the Santika. I wasn't sure what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. The room was a litle small as we had 3 single beds but it was manageable. With a double bed there would have been plenty of room. The rooms were cleaned meticulously every day and there were always plenty of towels etc. The breakfast was great with something for everyone. Staff were fine and the pool area was lovely. Only complaint is that there are not enough umbrellas so you have to get up early to get a decent sunbed otherwise you roast. The temperature of the pool was just wonderful and no matter how hot you could just dive in and feel refreshed without freezing. Love the Santika but the premier pool is always absolutely freezing. There are no safes in the room but we all used the hotel deposit boxes and never had a problem. The lobby, restaurant, pool and gardens are very nice and I would honestly stay here again. Do be warned the actual street is one of the worst!!! The paths are worse than normal and you do normally have to walk to JL Kartika Plaza to get a cab.

As this was our first time to Bali we were unsure of whether to stay in Kuta or not and decided the location of the Risata was a good compromise. The hotel is about 15-20 minutes walk from the centre of Kuta and about 10 from the Discovery Mall. The hotel also runs a shuttle service but we found that it is was easier (and probably quicker) to walk as there is very heavy traffic along the route.The hotel itself is very good, the pool area is lovely with lots of sunbeds, the staff are very attentive and friendly and get to know you after a few days.The buffet breakfast was excellent with lots of choice and changed every day, again here the staff were great and the food good. We didn't eat in the restaurant in the evening and it always seemed very quiet.Rooms are of a good size and clean, we were a bit disappointed not to get a balcony with our room but found the room perfectly adequate - king size beds, good shower, no safety deposit box but this can be done at reception.The hotel grounds are also well tended, although beware of the bats flying around at night. We also used the fitness centre which is very small.All in all a good experience.", "Date": "Jul 30, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR614246966", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "squirrell20"}, {"Content": "Hidden Jewel We recently stayed in Bali for three weeks with our 4 kids. This is our 3rd/4th trip to Bali, but the first time post-bombing and with the kids. Our 1st week was at the Risata, which is by far the best Kuta-based Hotel we have stayed in. The hotel is primarily time-share based and this is how we came to stay there. We did have to do a 90 min presentation, which was very relaxed and easy. The hotel is gold-crown rated which is the highest standard in time-share, however, maintains a 3 star rating for tax purposes, so don't be afraid of its 3 star rating, it is very spacious and luxurious. The pool is huge with a swim up bar that has AUD$5 pizzas and happy hour every arvo. The restaurant is very nice with well priced meals (for resort prices) There are also daily activities and information sessions around the pool area. There is a free ATM right at the entrance to the Hotel. (The Risata accepts AMEX, as do a lot of places in Bali. AMEX sought of sponsors the airport. Their currency conversion fee is much higher than Visa however, so don't be tricked. Ask before you travel) There are lots of very good, very cheap restaurants located nearby and because it is not close to Legian St, the prices were very competitive, and quality of foods outstanding. Pantai Kuta Restaurant is on the beach, just around the corner for beautiful, fresh seafood. $15 for +500g lobsters without the hassle of travelling to Jimbaran Bay. There is another rest. on the main road, about 3 mins walk from the back entrance, that does massive, all-you-can-eat b/fast, for about $5. The Risata is located on the dead end section of Jl Kartika Plaza and as such, has little through traffic/noise. It is only a 20000rp ($2.50) BlueBird taxi from the airport, but you don't hear any aircraft noise. Nearby salons are $6 for hour-long massages or body-scrubs. The back entry to the Hotel is a short-cut back to the main street and all the shopping you can handle. A small laneway just near the Pantai Restaurant has laundry shops that wash a basket of washing for $2, and iron it for the same amount, in 24 hrs. It is 5 mins walk to the Centro Shopping Mall/ Waterbom Park area. Centro has THE BEST bakery ever invented. Also genuine, brand name shopping outlets. Kuta Square is about 7 min walk or 10000rp taxi.($1.20) Kuta Square has the Matahari Supermarket for supplies, and has a free ATM, as well as the best money changer(at the side of the suprmrkt) She usually has the highest rate, no commission and gives you the right amount, first time, every time. Well worth the trip to Kuta Sq. We found the cheapest, easiest way of getting around Kuta is the BlueBird Taxis. They do not even attempt to rip you off or barter and are much cheaper than private drivers. Tuban beach is only 100m from the hotel entrance. If you walk down there you can organise all your transport arrangements for your stay, day trips, even boats for surfing/fishing/diving. The ladies operating the corner stall also do very good, cheap plaits, pedicure/manicures etc.  $50 for mum and 2 daughters for hair plaits, toe/ fngr nails, mini massages. A must if you have children is to visit the Marine Safari Park at Taman (45mins) Take your swimmers as there is a water park, funpark, zoo and safari all included for about US$20 each. There's camel/elephant rides. You can pat/hold a lion cub, orangutan, snake and with bird/monkey shows, it basically combines all other parks. Forget the hassle of Legian St, Kuta Beach, or Melasti Street. Tuban has everything and more, with much less hassle and cheaper also. You cannot possibly be disappointed by The Club Risata.

I stayed here a couple of years ago but it was a stay to remember. Because I came during the low peak season, the staff immediately upgraded me to a Junior Suite.

It was my first time in Bali. Bali is such a nice, charming and intriguing destination. I will definitely return to Bali soon.

Absolutely great value for money! The staff is fantastic - very friendly and after a week they felt like friends. The breakfast is good and the pool area great. The great thing about the Risata is its location, there is a food store close by, a place were you can rent a scooter next door (great to explore the island on your own) and the fact that you feel independent while traveling is great. The rooms are quite spacious, has air-con that actually works and hot water. You also get bottled water every morning. The only downside is that there are no bath tubs in the rooms.

We have nothing but praise to say about the hotel. The staff are incredible and really they all try to get to know all of their guests.  My husband and I have lived in the tropics for many years so it was not necessary for us to be staying at a hotel on the beach. The beach from the Risata is so close and yes I must admit it, the beach, is not very clean. But you can walk for miles along the beach which we seem to do every day that we are in Bali. Because of the location of the Risata, it is very quiet - traffic wise and in all the years that we have stayed there, the tourists in the Risata seem to respect other tourists in regards to being noisey well into the evening. The location to other areas is within walking distance or else a very short taxi ride. Breakfast is quite basic but a good variety and lots of it. Coffee is superb. Rooms are basic and very clean and room enough for two. Gardens are lovely and well kept. I really can't say enough about the Risata.

It was great and the pool and views at this resort were outstanding!We found the staff very accommodating at Risata and the meals inexpensive- we got discounts as timeshare members.The rooms were large- we only had a hotel room and it was big.We enjoyed our stay.We thought our hotel seemed to compare well with others in the vacinity.The pool is private to outsiders.In some resorts you could stare into the pool from the roadside.They offer a free shuttle to the airport on your way home", "Date": "Jul 23, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR187539700", "Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Business service": "2", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "oysterfiend"}, {"Content": "Solid 3 star       Bed", "Date": "Dec 25, 2006", "ReviewID": "UR823741274", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "1", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "3", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "sdjimbob"}, {"Content": "Risata fantastic We purchased an RCI Timeshare unit there some years ago and have only had the opportunity to stay there about 3 times since, however we could not have lucked into a better timeshare in my books.
