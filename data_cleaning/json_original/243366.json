The decor may not have been to my taste, but it was not offensive, the bathroom was very spacious, clean, white and in good condition.

I was attending a function in Mayfair and was running tight on time when I arrived. The main hotel door was locked and there was a note saying 'back in 5 minutes'. The receptionist eventually turned up only to inform me that the the twin room I had booked and paid for was already filled and there was no other twin room available. Luckily there was a single room available but I was kept at least 20 minutes whilst he tried to sort the booking (even though I stressed that I was late for the function). No apology was offered or a refund for the cheaper room as he said it was lastminute's fault (a fact that I now know not to be true). The small single room had a lumpy bed and a weak shower that sounded like a hair dryer (probably about right for the money though).

To be more precise water was falling from the ceiling wetting the carpet and the floor of the bathroom. The alarm started to sound (I think it was the fire alarm) and we went out of the room where we met an employee of the reception who was trying to stop the alarm that anyay went on sounding for four hours (that it is till 9 a.m.) and so we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep neither when the water stopped falling from the ceiling. The employee of the reception set the room putting some towels on the floor and on the carpet; then he tried to switch on the lights and he said that we could go back into our room. In the meantime, four boys of our group, awaken by the alarm sounding, came down from room n\u00c2\u00b0 8 and 9 and informed us that the bathroom of room n\u00c2\u00b0 9 had flooded probably because of the water that poured out from the ceiling of room n\u00c2\u00b01. On Saturday at 7 o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 clock p.m. when we came back into the hotel we noticed that a part of the plaster had come off from the ceiling of room n\u00c2\u00b0 1 and some pieces of the floor (small wooden.-beams) have fallen down on the carpet. (See the attached photo). On Sunday March 28th at 3 a.m. we came back again to the hotel and another employee of the hotel invited us to gather up our baggage quickly because half of the ceiling had fallen down while we were out. The floor was full of debris and rubble that had also fallen on our luggage and on our personal belongings. (We have a photo to be attached, too). She asked us to go up to our friends\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 rooms (n\u00c2\u00b0 8 and n\u00c2\u00b0 9) obviously because it was dangerous to stay in ours. We spent the remaining hours devided between the other rooms and none of the six components of the group managed to sleep or rest in a proper way because of the lack of beds and the availability of any other free room. Anyway it was the same as the previous night because we couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t sleep as well. Now, for all the reasons I said before, we ask to have the cost of two nights refunded. That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the least we can ask because it was a real miracle if the ceiling didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t collapse while we were in the room.

I think I got the same room as the last reviewer on the 4th floor as my floor sloped too, but I didn't roll out of bed! The sheets were crisp, the towels clean, it was airy and bright and the TV had freeview so plenty of channel choice. The staff were polite and they give you a front door key for late returns. They also loan you a TV remote control at check in - clearly some have gone missing in the past! My only crtitisism would be that the general upkeep could be improved; the over-bed light didn't work and the shower was more of a dribble, but for an overnight it was fine, and I wasn't expecting a Holiday Inn. Not at \u00c2\u00a385 a night within 100 yards of Marble Arch.

I wanted a resonably priced hotel that was centrally located with a little \"English charm, \" a cozy feel, and friendly knowledgable staff. My room was on the third floor (4th in American) and the bathroom was very large! The room was spotless and quite comfortable. The staff was fantastic and very flexible - I had a problem when I was missing some money (this did not happen in the hotel!) and staff was very understanding about waiting for payment from Western Union for a day or so. Overall, it fit my expectations. Also, there is a fantastic grocer a few blocks away close to Edgeware Road that has fantastic picnic food. It's called Green Grocer (or something like that); it is a mid-east style place with great flat bread! In sum, this hotel is quiet, clean, comfortable and cozy. I think that the less flattering reviews were, perhaps, a little unrealistic - don't check into any Marble Arch bed and breakfast if you are expecting the Savoy! This place is very close to Oxford St (if you can stand the overwhelming crowds) and Mayfair, Marylebone and Soho. If you want to take a nice walk, just go towards Marble Arch, walk down Park Lane, go left and you will run into Buckingham Palace. You couldn't ask for a better location for the price.
