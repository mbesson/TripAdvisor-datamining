The 'relative' term comes from the caked on dirt around the baseboards and tile in the bathroom and the kitchenette. It's not filthy, but looks like 20 years of daily cleaning without detailed scrubbing. The breakfast buffet was pretty good. A really, really good selection. The warm items were served steam table style, but were relatively fresh and all but the sausage was warm to hot. Good selection of breads, pastries, cereal, drinks and fruit. We also got a free $10 starbux and subway giftcard.

The hotel location is excellent, being almost in the centre of the downtown area and within walking distance of most of the major attractions. The King bed room was a decent size, with a large kitchen area, desk with a chair, large sofa and a medium sized bathroom. The room was comfortable and clean, although the kitchen did feel slightly dated and the air conditioning unit was slightly noisy. Service was good with staff being friendly and helpful. Free Wi-fi is available throughout the hotel (ask reception for the password). There was a free buffet breakfast in the morning with a good selection of food (including hot items such as scrambled eggs) and there were plenty of tables to sit at. One downside was that I stayed at the hotel during its extensive renovations. Whilst I knew about these before booking I would advise staying away from the hotel until they are complete. Large pieces of fabric blocked the windows (and thus the view) and workmen were working very close to my room a lot of the time, (on a few occasions rubble fell onto my balcony, although there are notices in the room asking not to use the balcony so I was in no danger). The work was noisy and dusty and during weekdays started early making a lie-in impossible. Workmen were also working in the room next to mine which meant staying in the room during the day was almost impossible. Once the workmen disappeared everything was fine. The swimming pool and gym area were out of action during my stay (although arrangements were made to allow guests to use facilities 10 minutes walk away). Once all the work is complete the hotel will be a great place to stay. The price is reasonable for the location and the full kitchens are a bonus. Whilst I appreciate the need to keep the hotel open during the renovations and the need to make them, it does seem a bit of a cheek charging the usual price for what is currently a sub-par experience. Bad points - Dated kitchen area. Elevators rides are jerky and not very smooth, can feel like a thrill ride on occasions! Good points - Great location for downtown, within walking distance of most things, large rooms and full kitchen areas. Breakfast buffet has nice selection and is included free. Free Wi-fi. Tips - There is a 7/11 just across from the hotel for snacks, with larger supermarkets a few blocks away. The hotel is about 10 minutes walk from the Skytrain (Vancouver City Centre or Yaletown - both on the Canada line). Fares from the airport require an extra add-on free, fares to the airport are the standard two-zone fee.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brentwood, Tennessee", "Title": "\u201cLove, love, loved this hotel!!\u201d", "Author": "Wanda628", "ReviewID": "UR117399194", "Content": "This was our first trip to Vancouver and we chose this hotel because of the great web special.

I was visiting Canada and my husband and I wanted a short break in the city which included his birthday, so this was a special trip for us. We wanted to be together in a cosy rather than posh place where we could feel relaxed and eat 'at home' if we wanted to just be together. Cascadia was the perfect choice! We had a Deluxe suite on the 15th floor with a balcony and view over the mountains and inlet. The location is excellent - just a short walk down the road gets you to the aquabus to Granville Island and the nearby streets are full of shops and places to eat. The room was spacious, immaculately clean and everything was provided in the super little kitchen, even a dishwasher! We didn't eat out but bought fresh produce and amazing pasta from Granville Island market and ate overlooking the view from the balcony. The bathroom was also immaculate, well-appointed, loads of towels for two and the toiletries were lovely - so nice I asked for some of the soap to take home with me and they gave me some without charge, which was very kind. There was free parking and free internet access, both useful and money saving. Breakfast was a buffet and I have to say the nicest I have had - so many choices of juice, fruits, fresh baking, lovely cereals and parfaits, a continuous toaster to make fresh hot toasted bagels, toast or muffins and also a hot selection which changed the next day but included sausages, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes and waffles. All in a large, well-appointed dining room. The staff were very efficient at replenishing the food choices and clearing away vacated tables and the atmosphere was relaxed not hurried. Breakfast is also served over a long period so that clearly makes this work very well. The staff were so helpful, polite and friendly without being intrusive. There were renovations going on, but they did not intrude on us at all as the scaffolding was below our floor anyway, but there was no noise or dust. If I had wanted to use the pool, I might have been a little put off by being observed by builders but that was a very minor consideration! We were also right next to the lift but there was also no noise from that whatsoever. The work to renovate this hotel building is well worth it because we think they have got everything else that they do so right.

The room backed onto the elevator shafts so we did hear the ping of the elevator as it stopped on our floor. The location wasn\u2019t too bad. We caught taxis to the more distant places and walked the rest. The bed was very comfortable and the internet was good, but it did slow dramatically when a lot of people were using it. It was WiFi which was handy for us as we were using our Ipod Touch\u2019s for skyping back home. The full kitchen was well equipped but we didn\u2019t use it. The buffet breakfast was pretty good and the dining room was a fair size. Unfortunately the pool was closed for maintenance during our stay but, the laundry was open and we put that to good use. We had room service the first night in the hotel (steak), it was very nice. We had a wonderful dinner in the restaurant downstairs on our last night in Vancouver. We were served by a lovely hostess, Alexi. The food was wonderful and later that same night we went back to the restaurant for hot chocolate and dessert which was equally lovely. Overall it is a very nice hotel with good staff. The room was a little small but the good restaurant and laundry room more than made up for that. I would recommend to others.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Medford, Oregon", "Title": "\u201cA hotel that aims to please: Great value/service/location/buffet\u201d", "Author": "marty1953", "ReviewID": "UR89535090", "Content": "Every single interaction we had with the Cascadia hotel was positive.

I decided to give it a chance as I had read the hotel had been renovated but upon entering (for lack of a better word) the 'used' room, I was sorely disappointed. The toilet looked like it had been burned and the lid wouldn't stay up. Also, there was a door to an adjoining room where you could hear a pin drop (now imagine how loud the screaming match was next door). There were not that many people staying in the hotel and we had booked in advance (even sent an e-mail to which we did not receive a response), you would think they could have offered us a decent room. They, also, did not refill the toiletries. Although the Executive was the same price as Cascadia, we cancelled it solely on the rating Cascadia had received (maybe it is because of the changeover from the Marriott Residence Inn not too long ago that it hasn't been reviewed as much ?). We had even considered booking the Best Western whose Hot Breakfast is, as a whole, good and has fresh fruit, doesn't have rubbery sausages, watery eggs (even the personnel put the toaster back to a higher setting directly after we adjusted it to not burn our next set of toast) and they were not as expensive as Cascadia. The Cascadia Inn & Suites internet site made breakfast look good as it did everything else. Again, we chose according to the TA ratings. During our stay the pool was closed (but there was no discount), the elevators weren't working one evening (we were on a higher floor), there wasn't any parking or stopping out front due to construction which you could hear very early in the morning and the absolute was that they shut off the water for a day (with a little notice in the elevator which I would normally not pay attention to) with no reimbursement. They offer a room with a kitchenette and they shut off the water, I am curious how the cleaning personnel cleaned the rooms that day. Anyways, we had just finished a whirlwind tour of North America and this was the only hotel that we had chosen because of the good ratings and this was by far the worst hotel we had encountered (we even kept getting locked out of our room because the keys were set for only one day). I have never written a review on Trip Advisor up until now but I felt it was important that people knew what they are getting themselves into (I wish I had paid attention to the warnings from other reviewers).

Free wireless and high-speed Internet access!! A lot and especially Hotels in the 200-400$ range still charge for the Internet!!! Well it`s quite price you pay for that hotel, well all Hotels are in Vancouver aren`t cheap. But be advised, you get a lot more value here. The probably biggest benefit is a completely equipped kitchen with quite a large refrigerator with an small intergreted freezer. Housekeeping takes good care of the rooms, so they are quite clean. Room service is also excellent, they have a quite small menu but that what they serve is outstanding and in my oppinion far above 3*. The prices are as well very rational. There is no tray charge and tip is to you`re descretion (no 20% service tax). From the higher floor rooms, facing downtown the view is incredible. And last but not least, you have complymentary breakfast. I can`t say anything about that since I never had time to use... The only drawback is that the hotel is quite a distance from the center downtown. So for shopping on Robsons Street (famous shopping street in Vancouver) or to go to the Waterfront a Taxiride is unavoidable unless you a fan of city hikes. Distance about 10-12 Blocks (Taxiride approx. CAD 8.- one way) But be awere, the Hotels in the ultimate center of Vancouver can cost easly 100 CAD$+ per Night. So this one is a very good option. This Hotel is very recomendable for anybod traveling on a budget or/and would like to have a refrigerator instead of a minibar stocked with 5$ sodas.

The rooms are also air conditioned and have the usual TV (if not flatscreen). The internet is both wireless and wired. It is easy to hook up with, and very fast, as well as being free. There are loads of supermarkets nearby, so you can also make yourself a nice lunch, if you are bored of resturants and want to save your wallet.

A couple of good sushi places in the area. - Relatively friendly and efficient front desk - when we asked to be on the side opposite to the supposedly loud night club the girl at the front desk first wanted to \"upgrade\" us for $20/night, but then found a room for the original price. We did have to wait for it to be ready. - Parking is secure and is not as expensive as other hotels, from what I understand. Ours came up to $26/night including tax - They have a free computer with Internet and free printer in the lobby, which is very convenient if you need to print out your tickets or say vouchers for trolley/excursions - The room was spacious and relatively clean.

As if no one stayed in it for a few days after it had been cleaned. Which sort of didn't make a lot of sense, since the girl at the reception made us wait for it \"to be cleaned and ready\". Dust gave the room a bit of a unclean feeling. I had to get some paper towels and wipe the dust before we started unpacking. - Toiletries (shampoo and conditioner) smelled real bad, so bring your own - Breakfast service, just like other reviewers mentioned, was very hectic. . Breakfast ladies were efficient borderline aggressive. Especially 10 minutes or so before the scheduled end of the breakfast service they were on the mission to get everyone out of the room and start cleaning. So if you want to have your breakfast in a leisure manner - come at least 40 min before the ending time. - Common areas (hallways, pool bathroom) looked very run down and not as clean as the rooms. Bathroom didn't have soap, lockers were rusty. Overall, for the price we paid - I think it was a decent place and we'd stay there again.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Providence, Rhode Island", "Title": "\u201cGreat, affordable hotel!\u201d", "Author": "david_tanya", "ReviewID": "UR69757410", "Content": "We stayed at Cascadia during our recent trip to Vancouver after purchaing the hotel through Hotwire for $99.

The hotel staff was not that friendly the first night we got there, but I think it depends of who's working, because they were friendly other times. We had some problems with the bath tub backing up, but they fixed it fast the first night. The breakfast is quite good, with everything we wanted; eggs, fruits, cereal etc...definitely more than we expected. And the fact that it has free internet, which worked very well, was another bonus.

The room itself had a complete mini-kitchen, including fridge, stove, oven, dishwasher, and all the kitchenware you would need to cook and eat your own meal-- very convenient! One of my favorite activities was going to the beach at the Spanish Banks, where the ground is so flat, the tide recedes about 50 yards during low-tide and you can walk for ages into the water and still have it only up to your knees! A great spot for skimboarders and children to play in shallow water. We were also able to pick-up a few fun volleyball games with the locals, who were amazingly friendly. Bocce ball was also a popular activity. Since Vancouver is so north, the sun sets very late during the summer, around 9:00 p.m., and lasts for an hour, giving you many hours of sunlight to play... and a majestic sunset to finish your day.

To give you a better perspective of this hotel, let me give you a background about us. We are a group of four, with a 27-year old daughter and an 8-year old son. We travel at least once a year, going out of the country every other year. We tend to be frugal to modest travelers, but we do splurge once in a while. Cascadia is a good hotel, and for a downtown Vancouver location was reasonable for $200 US/night for peak season. It is a hotel suite, so our room had 2 queen size beds, a sofa (not a loveseat), a fridge, a microwave, a coffee maker, a dishwasher, stove top range, and, of course, a tv. (I did ask for 2 beds.) I was at first disappointed considering I was comparing this to a hotel suite that we stayed in at Montreal a few years ago. That hotel suite was more like a mini apartment. Cascadia, on the other hand, is a hotel suite that is more like a hotel with a more room. However, my son did approve of the hotel and he said it was nice. My son has become very picky (more like \"spoiled\") with hotels and expects a certain standard. We have recently been staying at resort-type hotels (through timeshare purchases/exchanges) thus he expects something as nice and comfortable. So for him to say \"nice\" means that it is better than what he expected. We told him that it is a hotel and not like the resort-type hotels, we've been staying previously. Breakfast is free and they do provide a decent spread. Eggs, pancakes, bagels, muffins, pastries, cereals, fruits, sausages, potatoes, etc. So, having breakfast at the hotel is a good idea. They serve breakfast between 6:30 am to 9:30 a.m. We're very relaxed travelers so for the 2 days we ate at 9:00 a.m. One thing great is they do have self-service laundry (2nd floor, need your room key). $2.00 Canadian each for washer or dryer. They do sell soap and dryer liner ($2/Can). Note, the load takes $1/Can. coins, while the dryer takes quarters/Can. So have the necessary change. The front desk had some change, but not much. My husband had to go to two 7-11 stores before he got the appropriate change. This is our pre-cruise stay and having a place to do laundry before our 7-day cruise was wonderful. It cuts down the amount of clothes we bring. Note, comparing it to our washer and dryer at home, the capacity I believe is smaller. It seems you needed to dry clothes twice to be really dry. So allocate accordingly. Location: It is good, but we did use the taxi a lot. Stanley Park is walkable, though we did took a taxi going there but walked back to the hotel via interesting streets. Many places are walkable. The casino is close by (taxi $8.00/Can). Granville Island -- you can walk to the dock and take the ferry. Ferry was $3/C each with child and senior at half price.

Robson street walkable. Caveat: If you are walking from Gastown to Chinatown, be wary about Hastings St. [We had dinner at Old Spaghetti Factory (great food, very reasonable - approx $13/Can pasta meal, with coffee, and ice cream ($6 child meal with drink and ice cream).] We somehow stumbled near an area where the place and the people around which were a tad unpleasant. I read about this area (not all Hastings St. is bad) and there seems to be a lot of homeless and drug use. My son was so unnerved that after reaching Chinatown, he wanted to go home. He felt unsafe. (So we did not see much of Chinatown at all. Just enough to get a cab back to the hotel).

Got this hotel through priceline. For some reason I was a little worried after first getting this hotel through priceline because it was changing from a Marriot Residence Inn to this new ownership group and I thought it may be a bit rundown. But those fears were unfounded and I am happy to say that this was a really great hotel that I got for a really good price. The hotel is in a decent area and within walking distance to a lot of attractions. There is a trolley (for a fee) that stops right outside the hotel. Checkin staff was really helpful when I first arrived. I thought I was going to get a \"priceline\" room (usually lower floor, more beds than you need, near a high traffic area, no view, by the elevator, etc) but I got a room on one of the top floors with none of those priceline cons. The pros to the room were that it was clean (carpet, bedding, bathroom, kitchenette, sitting area, desk, balcony), quiet (no thin walls), and very large. I'm not sure if this is true of every room, but I had a small kitchenette that included a minifridge, sink, microwave, stove/oven, toaster, plates, dishwasher, counterspace, plates/utensils. I only used the fridge, but it was very convenient. I had somewhat of a view from my balcony (I could see False Creek as well as the Lookout Tower from my room) but it was ruined by the construction that was going on right in front of me. At least I did not hear any construction noises in the morning. There is complimentary breakfast which I really liked (I'm not that picky when it comes to food) that had a decent selection (eggs, sausage, potatoes, pancake/french toast, bagels, croissants, muffins, fruit, yogurts, granola, oatmeal, toast, juice, coffee, milk--some items changed, like one day pancakes, one day french toast). The have secure garage parking which was $19/day. They had free internet acess both in the room and in the lobby. There is a pool which I did not use. Minor cons to the room: the airconditioning is loud, but not untolerable (more like white noise). The faucet in the bathroom sink in my room was in an awkward position--too far from the sink, which made it kind of difficult to wash my hands. Also, the one overhead light in the bathroom was very hot. If you stand right underneath it it's like standing under a heat lamp. I'm not very tall but I could still feel how hot it was. A taller person might burn his head if he stood there for a long period of time. Kind of weird complaints, but there really wasn't much to complain about. The only other significant complaint I had was they only have partime concierge service, and the one time I did manage to talk to someone he was not that helpful. The free brocures and internet service were more useful to me. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for the spacious and clean rooms, as well as the ammenities in the rooms.

The only complaint would be that the tiles in the shower were dated, but all in all, very nice and all was clean. They didn't charge us for the crib, which was very nice. The hot buffet breakfast is self-serve and was overwhelming: oatmeal option with raisins, shaved coconut, granola; toast/english muffins; waffle makers one day; 3 kinds of yogurt with granola and fresh fruit; pastries; bananas, apples to take away; scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausages/patties, pancakes or french toast; juices and coffee/tea. Easily, we saved $25 each day filling up so that we didn't need to buy lunch. The pool was a bit chilly, but the hottub was nice. We used the laundry facilities, but instead of paying $2 for soap from the dispenser, walk across the street to the 7-11, its only .99!

Location: Not being very familiar with Vancouver, I trusted a friend who told me this location was central. I originally was looking for something closer to Robson but in hindsight, I thought this location was even better. It is only about 4 or 5 blocks from Robson. And in Vancouver, it is a joy to walk. It is also only 3 or 4 blocks to the Aquatic Centre where ferries and water taxis can take you to mulitple destinates including Granville Market. One night, we were tired and wanted to bring food back. I took a walk down Davie St. (hotel is between Davie and Drake) and within 2 blocks in the colorful neighborhood known as the West End, I had my choice of Vietnamese, Japanese, Hamburgers, Greek, Chinese, etc. All this is close enough to be convenient but far enough to not be noise problem. I think Vancouver's public transit works really well. And many of the buses we needed ran down Howe St. street which was the next street over. 2. Value: I found this hotel using TripAdvisor and booked it through United to take advantage of frequent flyer miles. But whatever site you use, the rates are very, very reasonable. For the location, the number of people one room can sleep (4 in our case), and the level of comfort, you cannot beat the price. And internet access is free! Oh and all-you-can-eat breakfast included! 3. Comfort: The room was big. It had 2 queen size beds, a desk for my laptop and a little sofa. It was me, my mom and my mother-in-law. We never felt cramped or uncomfortable. In the little kitchen, there is everything you need to make food in the room should you decide that over eating out. The beds were very comfortable and I slept well. 4. Breakfast: While it is by no means gourmet, it was very satisfying. Yogurt, granola, sausage, french toast on some days, pancake on others, potatoes. Oatmeal for us health nuts with fixins'. And some pastries and fruit. The eggs were delicious. I couldn't eat enough of their scrambled eggs! My one suggestion for this hotel is that they hire another bellhop. The one bellhop I saw was working his butt off but while he was putting luggage away or delivering something, there was no one to help waiting guests.

We walked everywhere - all through downtown as well as along the water by the Canada Place cruise ship terminal. Our friends enjoyed the trolley tour as it stopped close to our hotel. The breakfast was very god and we enjoyed it the day of our departure on Saturday morning. They do have an early checkout (11:00 am). I thought it was early. We didn't leave until 12:00 and had no problem getting a taxi out front to take us to our cruise ship at Ballntyne Pier. The cruise was amazing and we loved Vancouver as well.

We'd never been to Vancouver and thought it would be fun to visit there. We were on vacation that also included stops in Seattle to visit family and then San Francisco. Vancouver was the first stop. First the bad... I booked this hotel through Hotels.com. Never again! I have come to believe, after having done this before, that when you arrive, the hotels give you the crappiest rooms they have. I will never use Hotels.com again. One hotel in NYC charged me more to move rooms after we found the bed was too short for my 6'3\" friend. This time, at the Residence Inn, I was given a room that had mold growing on the air vent. I didn't notice it though until the following morning when I woke up very sick. I was previously feeling great, but I am allergic to mold so this was a huge problem. I called the front desk to complan and they first said that all the vents were recently cleaned. I said they must have missed this room. So, then they said they would gladly move me. The next room also had mold on the vent. I called the front desk again. This time, they sent over a janitor. I showed him the problem and watched as he wiped off the mold. I told him this was not how you \"kill\" mold. I explained it had to be soaked or sprayed with a 10% bleach to 90% water solution to actually kill the mold. He took it away and half an hour later, it was clean. I smelled it to be sure he's really used bleach, and he had. I then went down to the front desk and spoke to the manager on duty and several of the front desk clerks over heard us. He credited me 1 of the 4 nights of our stay. He also instructed the clerks to make sure anything I wanted from the restaurant would be \"free of charge\". However, when I got the bill, this was not the case, even though one of the clerks who had heard this conversation was there when I checked out. The manager though was not. She denied she had herad him say this. I had no witnesses of my own to back me up so I let it go. She did credit me for 2 movies though since I had to stay in the hotel when I should have been out enjoying the city more. Other than that, the only compalint I have is the breakfast. It was the same every morning and only so-so. And now the good... The gym was ok. Never tried the pool or hot tub. Too many others were using it when we went down there. Besides, we were not in Vancouver to go to the gym or go swimming. However, my older daughter found a Pilates class down the street one morning that she enjoyed. The restaurant downstairs has very good food, though the kitchen was a little slow one night. The mixed drinks were strong though, so can't complain. And due to the slowness, they gave us free desserts. When we ordered room service, which we did a couple of times because I was too sick to leave and thought it was all going to be free, the food was good and it arrived in a timely manner. The front desk clerks were very helpful in recommending where to go and how to get places without taking the car. I also really appreciated the umbrellas that were in our room because it rained every day of our trip, though only for a few hours and not that hard. Make sure you head over to Granville Island for some unique (but pricey) gifts and things. I'm an artist so I really loved this. Too bad we didn't go earlier in the day though as the shops all closed by 6ish. We stayed and went to the Comedy Theater in the evening for an audience participation show. That was fun!

There are so many restaurants, shops, and local flavor within walking distance that we didn't have to take a cab anywhere (except the airport upon our departure)! The hotel has its own restaurant and bar, which looked small, but very nice (although we did not eat there at all). We stayed in a room on the 17th floor, and the view was awesome! Our room had a walk-out balcony (with 2 chairs) that overlooked the city, the harbor, and the nearby mountains. The room itself has a standard but clean bathroom, comfortable bed, a sitting area, and a kitchenette. It was quite spacious. The kitchenette was especially convenient- it had a stove/oven, microwave, sink, diswasher, coffee pot, and all the plates/cups/utensils you would need to cook a decent meal. The hotel will even take your grocery list and go shopping for you- just for the cost of the food! There was also a nice assortment of coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and microwave popcorn. The meeting and banquet facilities were nice, as well as the food we were served at the conference. I would highly recommend this location for groups that need a meeting area. One day our room didn't get cleaned until after 1PM, which was a little annoying (since I like to take an afternoon nap sometimes), but other than that, I have no complaints about the hotel! I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in downtown Vancouver.", "Date": "February 21, 2007"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "4", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Nanaimo", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!!\u201d", "Author": "knightfamily44", "ReviewID": "UR6718032", "Content": "We stayed here during Christmas and we were pleasantly surprised.

The best thing about it was just how clean and comfortable the rooms were. I am picky when it comes to hotels, and this far exceeded my expatiations.

We were upgraded to a harbour view room, which had great views day and night. We particularly enjoyed watching the sea planes taking off and landing. Top class swimming pool and spa pool. Breakfast was not included in the price we paid for our room (not unusual in Canada), but there are plenty of reasonably priced cafes nearby. The rotating restuarant at the top of the hotel is well worth a visit - great range of cocktails and interesting views - we were surprised how well priced both the drinks and food were (service was very, very slow though).", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Cascadia Hotel & Suites", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g154943-d183637-Reviews-Cascadia_Hotel_Suites-Vancouver_British_Columbia.html", "Price": "$80 - $150*", "Address": "<address class=\"addressReset\"><span rel=\"v:address\"><span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">1234 Hornby Street</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Vancouver</span>, <span property=\"v:region\">British Columbia</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">V6Z 1W5</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Canada</span> (Formerly Residence Inn)</span></span></address>", "HotelID": "183637", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/7a/97/c5/cascadia-hotel-suites.jpg"}}
