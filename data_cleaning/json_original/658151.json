{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Excellent Budget Inn I came here after having moved rooms in another inn where the new room was mouldy, dank,old and scruffy and I decided I just couldnt stay there. What a pleasant surprise! For less money than we were paying in Asakusa, we got our own room, big window with a blind, airconditioner, small flat screen tv, mini foldaway table and two futons.Toilets and showers are all separate with plenty of space. Spotlessly clean. Even if you are scared of hostels because of shared bathrooms, you will enjoy this place. Id say it cant be beaten for the price. Recommend checking their website -its accurate. *sorry -cant do punctuation on this keyboard!They also charge less per night, the longer you stay.Pay for cooker, laundry, shower.Free internet, sweets/candy, Japan TimesThe area is the only downside. Its a low class area, which seems to have a disproportionately large number of men, many of whom start drinking in the morning and are paralytic by the afternoon, by which time they take a nap on the pavement. Perhaps not the best if youre a lone female and want to come home at night, but its fine if you do everything during the day or have company.Many people who stay here are French.", "Date": "Jul 5, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR965411639", "Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Business service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "leilei2000"}, {"Content": "Fantastic. We're going back again. We went there in 07, and are bowled over by the owners' sincere hospitality and friendliness. It is spotless, the shared toilets are cleaner than many other hotels with attached toilets. We are going back to Tokyo this year and will definitely be staying there again. Highly highly recommended.", "Date": "Jun 19, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR867119434", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "gospelfeet"}, {"Content": "Very nice place Stayed 2 weeks with a friend, the staff is amazing and the location is great.

Booked on the recommendation from a friend who was staying there for a week. Received a prompt response from Kiyoaki about the resevation. We got the smaller double room, for two people. Pretty good rate (5900yen for one night).The location is a little inconvenient; while there were no issues getting to the station, we got pretty lost trying to find it after that, unfortunately with a ton of luggage. Turns out its easier to find than we were interpreting it (turned somewhere we didn't need to), definitely make sure you have directions with you before you try to find it though. it's not the nicest street in the world, but I think there were at least one or two convenience stores. Everything inside is certainly clean, and there are couches and a TV and newspapers and coffee in the lobby area by the reception counter, as well as a table with 3 computers (there's some space on the table and a hub if you want to plug in your own laptop for internet access- bring your own ethernet cable though). Remember to take your shoes off in the genkan (entryway)! You'll put them in a cabinet, and they'll give you slippers.After we checked in, they helped us drag all of our luggage up the stairs (its a small, staircase with a turn, no elevator) and gave us the room key (all the rooms have their own key). The room was probably a little small for the amount of luggage we had. There's a small LCD TV in the corner, an air conditioner, and the futon will be folded on one side of the room when you come in. Although most people who will read this will likely already know, but just in case: the floor in the rooms is the traditional tatami mat style floor (the room sizes at aizuya are measure by the number of tatami mat pieces that make up the floor- ours was 4.5 tatami) and the bedding is futon, on the floor (certainly saves space). The bathrooms and a row of sinks were at the end of the hallway, and they were all clean. The showers are on the first floor, and are coin operated (5 minutes for 100 yen), and there are a few shower rooms (didn't have to wait). Think 5 minutes is a little short? Luckily time stops when you turn off the water, so it wasn't a problem. They provided soap and such in the shower rooms (probably need your own towel though). Since I had been in Tokyo almost a week already, the washer and dryer came in handy for laundry- they have 2 of each, and I bought a single use packet of detergent from the front desk for I think 200 yen? I forget exactly, it may have been 300, maybe a bit cheaper. The washer and dryers are on the first floor, and are also coin operated. Note that while washers are usually fine, dryers in Japan usually take forever to dry, especially if you have heavy fabric or denim, it may take a few cycles to actually dry fully, so you may want to just do a small load with only things you really need. In the same room opposite the laundry machines is the kitchen area, with a sink, toaster, hot plates, and a refrigerator (I think they may have had pots and pans you could use...).It's definitely a place I'd stay at if I was going to be there for a few weeks, in which case a small single room for one person would probably be great, and the laundry facilities and all... for the amount of luggage we had it wasn't quite so much fun, but that's more of the fault of my booking so many different hotels, and less the fault of Aizuya Inn. If you're on a really tight budget, it's probably pretty hard to go wrong with this place.", "Date": "Nov 4, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR288837565", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "2"}, "Author": "ibmman"}, {"Content": "Way Nicer than \"Hostel\" Name Suggests! I have had some negative experiences in hostels, so I was skeptical about Aizuya Inn, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The rooms were spotlessly clean, and the shared bathroom even more so - it was so neat and dry, it didn't even matter that it was communal. The front desk clerk was friendly and helpful, too. The location is not very central, but it's only a short walk to the subway.", "Date": "Oct 9, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR773699578", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "4", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "3"}, "Author": "piers2"}, {"Content": "Great budget guest house Stayed here in May 2007. It is a newly renovated hotel, about 10 minutes walk from Minami Senju metro and Minami Senju JR station. These stations offer you pretty convenient access to the city. If you are the type that needs to run back to your room all the time, it may be a bit far, but if you stay out all day, its quite convenient. Inlcluding the walk, its about 10-15 minutes to Ueno, 20-25 minutes to Tokyo station, about 30-35 minutes to Shinjuku. There is a great grocery store about 3 minutes walk from the inn. There seems to be several harmless drunks around the area on Saturday nights, but this is probably true everywhere. I think its safe even for women traveling alone.The inn itself is superb. Very clean and well appointed with all new fixtures. The rooms are spartan but very clean. You may get a TV. The single rooms are small but its plenty for one person. Windows open and ventilation is good. The bathrooms are numerous and very clean. The shower cost 100yen for 5 minutes, but it is very clean and lots of hot water. Coin laundry also. Fridge, microwave, hotplates, free tea and free internet. A nice lounge, lobby area with TV. The owner, Kenji, speaks good English and is very helpful. The prices are low. Highly recommended for budget travelers and the non-hotel crowd. www.aizuya-inn.com", "Date": "Jun 10, 2007", "ReviewID": "UR687868590", "Ratings": {"Service": "-1", "Business service": "-1", "Cleanliness": "-1", "Check in / front desk": "-1", "Overall": "5", "Value": "-1", "Rooms": "-1", "Location": "-1"}, "Author": "HelloMonty"}], "HotelInfo": {"HotelURL": "http://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g1066461-d658151-r17547303-Aizuya_Inn-Taito_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html", "HotelID": "658151", "Price": "$64"}}
