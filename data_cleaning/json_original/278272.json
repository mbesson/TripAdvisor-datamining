Our favourite part was the breakfast which was included in the room price. Fresh fruit cup, warm croissants that melt in your mouth, and the best coffee we have ever had in our life. All this and free internet service. We found all the staff extremely helpful and one of their better recommendations was the restaurant \"Rossa's\" (a favourite of Johnny Depp's while filming a recent movie) which is a three minute walk from the hotel. Everything is extremely close with a walk to St. Mark's Square being only about seven or eight minutes.

The bathroom/en suite was very nice, all marble and large, but the shower/tub had no shower door, no partial door (European style), nor even a shower curtain. Given that the tub was so narrow (impossible to sit comfortably, and difficult at times even to turn around while standing), and that the shower head was typical old-style Italian handheld model, it made taking a shower an adventure (and put water ALL OVER the floor). It wasn't a major issue, but taking a shower was not terribly relaxing or a way to unwind after a long day. I know this is quite common in some places in Europe (I have been to Europe dozens of times, and fortunately this design feature is slowly disappearing), but a partial door would have made the issue go away.

It consisted of tea, coffee and fruit juices to drink. To eat there was a selection of meats, cheese, rolls, bread, croissants, muffins, cereals, fresh fruits and fruit salad. On of the staff recmmended we eat at the Beccafico in Campo St Stefano as we were celebrating our engagement during our trip. Sooooooo glad we ate here. It is listed as the number 1 restaurant in Venice, on Tripadviser. We had the most fantastic meal here. The waiter was fantastic (well worth the 12% service charge.) If you go and you like seafood and shellfish you havee to have the mixed starter. It consists of 14 different starters and is \u00e2\u201a\u00ac40 for two. Our meal came to \u00e2\u201a\u00ac140 which equated to \u00c2\u00a3119. This included a bottle of champagne and 3 courses each.

I found directions from a previous reviewer and they were brilliant, we found the hotel very easily and it was only a few minutes walk from San Marco. The check-in was easy and the hotel staff very friendly. Our twin room was lovely, very comfortable beds, plenty of wardrobe space and the bathroom was gorgeous! The view from our room was of the rooftops, but also the campanile at San Marco.the only downside we can think of would be the lack of comfortable seating when we returned to the hotel at night, this would have been great so we could have enjoyed a more leisurely drink. Oh and if you need the radiators turned up you need to contact reception as it's controlled from there!But that said the location was perfect, being only a few minutes walk from the Square, but also all the quaint little shops to browse in. The Vaparetto stop was easy to find, but we actually didn't find the need to use the vaparettos as everywhere was very accessible by foot. All in all we had a brilliant time. The breakfast was lovely, and everything you need to set you up for the day.The hotel staff were very helpful ,especially on the morning we were leaving, as it was high-tide and everywhere was flooded! They gave us directions to avoid the worst of the floods so we could catch the bus back to the airport!I would definitely stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others, and what can you say about Venice - BEAUTIFUL.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Leicester UK", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel in a perfect location.\u201d", "Author": "LesDouglas Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR95377020", "Content": "Stayed in a standard room which was fine, breakfast very good for continental type.

There is no restaurant in the hotel, only snacks are available this however is not a problem as when you are in Venice you want to get out and about and the hotel being only a 5 min walk from St Mark's Square means there are lots of good restaurants about. The bar in the hotel offers a wide range of drinks and does great cocktails for extremely reasonable prices relative to the rest of Venice.

We purchased the tickets at one of the airport ticket machines for 13 euros each. The vaperettos arrive hourly and although they can take a while to get to the final stop ( San Marco Square) it was particulalry easy. After a short while of suitcase lugging my fiance and I finally arrived at this hidden, little hotel much to our relief. Although it's location is somewhat secluded, we found it to be central to all the main sights and attractions, while maintaining a quiet ambience to retire to at the end of the day. After arriving we were warmly greeted by friendly staff, showing us to our small but comfortable room. The room was spotlessly clean, and although we did not have a frescoed ceiling this did not make a difference to our stay at all. Breakfast was of a continental style and we happily tucked into croissants, toast, cereals, youghts, fresh fruit and coffee everyday ( the coffee is particulalry recommendable) all of which we enjoyed. We later booked a Gondola trip through the Hotel, which we found to be really good value. We shared our boat with another couple which worked out at 25 euros per person for a 45 minute ride. Other Gondoliers were charging higher prices, so this is definately recommended. We also enjoyed a glass of Prosecco in the hotel bar which we felt was great value at only 3 euros a glass. The city overall is expensive and my fiance and I did at times feel ripped off at some of the restaurants. We would recommend checking some of the cheaper restaurants on trip advisor first the Omnibus Restaurant close to the Rialto Bridge was great for pizza and good value too!

We were shown to our beautiful room with a high slating ceiling, wooden beams and luscious red d\u00c3\u00a9cor (very Venetian) We had a view across the many roof tops and you could look down and see the canal entrance to the hotel. The en suite bathroom was very spacious with a lovely marble sink area and good shower.

There was one occasion we had to come back to get a table over the 4 days we were there but it was literally a five minute wait. We would definately reccommend the superior suites at the Duodo Palace and would return. The places we would recommend in Venice are: The Basilica - just beautiful! The Doge\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Palace \u00e2\u20ac\u201c It is like a step back in time, fantastically stunning painted ceilings, rooms and art works. The history is also very interesting. Rialto Bridge - and local markets Gondola Ride \u00e2\u20ac\u201c We passed many men trying to sell us a gondola ride but really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feel the trueness of it, a bit like a group of lads trying to make an easy buck. We happened to come across a gentleman on the 3rd day that was slightly older with his boat stationed on a small canal. He seemed very genuine and friendly all dressed in his attire. It was a lovely experience which took us on a tour of the many famous buildings and the Grand Canal. It cost us 80 euros for about 45 minutes which I think is the average cost. Carpaccio\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Restaurant \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Beautiful, fresh food, good wine and friendly service. We went here for our anniversary meal.

The hotel will book one for you if you like, but we decided to get one when we arrived next to the vaparetto in P Del Roma On arriving at the hotel, We were greeted by very helpful and friendly staff - in fact all the staff we came across could not have been nicer. I had also emailed them previously before we arrived to ask a few things and they were so helpful, we couldnt fault them The rooms were spotless and although you dont get much of a view the hotel is charming with lots of character and tradition, yet with modern ameneties We had read some iffy reviews of the breakfast but we were happy with it - you wont find a fry up, but a generous continental spread which filled us up for our day of walking around Venice Our return flight wasnt till late evening and the hotel is happy for you to leave your luggage to collect later at no cost so you can make the most of the day. We had a great time in Venice and the hotel certainly lived up to our expectations and more - we would definately recommend and go back again if we get the chance", "Date": "January 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london", "Title": "\u201cLovely Hotel\u201d", "Author": "ollocks", "ReviewID": "UR21635959", "Content": "Just had a great two days in Venice staying in the Duodo Palace Hotel.

The bedrooms were spotless and typically venetian with gold fabric walls and furnishings- the bathroom large and spotless. The location of the hotel is great 10min walk to Rialto,St Marks or accademia but still very quiet. The break fast is continentla in style, venetians don't eat breakast- you can buy eggs and bacon but they are a bit pricey, the breakfast included is fine so I wouldn't bother-I particularly liked the panettone- currant bread spread with butter. The hotel staff were really helpful and not snooty (which they can be in some places in venice- the unmissable cafe Florian in Piazza St Marco, for instance). We ate at Gallileo just round the corner from the hotel on or first night and the food was excellent- if you like cheese we'd highly reccomend the ravioli gallileo- they have the typical four course meal but we didn't have all of them , a pasta and a main course is fine. It was a little pricey at 90 euros all in with a half bottle of wine but the quality and quantity of the seafood was worth it(tuna and seabass). We ate at a touristy place by Rialto in front of the rialto hotel as its so scenic by night and paid just a bit less but we only had pizzas but two fab starters, highly reccomend the melon and parma ham or the beef carpaccio here, you get loads - the pizzas were nice too and the wine not too bad price. We ate round the corner from the hotel at the teatro- the food was ok and seemed reasonably priced but when you add a 12.5% service charge and cover charge it added over \u00c2\u00a320 onto the bill. We wanted to eat at Da rafaelle on cala ostreghe but we picked the night it was closed ! that is something you need to watch as it seems to be a district thing in Venice- we also got caught out by trying to visit Peggy Guggenheim Art gallery on a Tuesday- don't it's closed. We only had 3 days so by the time we were back at the room couldn't be bothered to venture far but I'd try Dosodoro or SantaPolo/Croce as the restaurants there looked better value. We also walked down to Zattere which looks over Giudecca- there was a great view and some reasonable restaurants there too. As first time visitors (but not the last !)to Venice we did all the must dos- some tips........ get a ticket for the Palazzo Ducale- its fab and don't miss the Doges Apartments- if you think Versaille is opulent you need to see this- the same ticket at 11 euros covers you for the museum in St Marcs Square (the museo correr which is really good and is at the top of the square-the ticket also covers you for palazzo mocenigo)- if you go in the cafe in museo correr (and do nothing else from the cafe del arte you get the best and cheapest) view of St Marcos square and the coffee is reasonably priced. Also in the basement of the pallazo ducale( doge palace) there is a cafe where you can have a sandwich and watch the gondolas pass by through a window which is not far off water level- the only place we found to do this. Like all places in venice if you stand up the cost of what you have (food or drinks)is a third less than sitting down but hours on your feet means you soon give up on that one. Final tip get a number 1 waterbus service from St marco to Piazza del a roma early on in your trip- takes about 40 mins and you get lovely views of the Grand canal we walked all the way back from Piazza del Roma by crossing over the bridge (there is a great sandwich shop here) through the streets down to Rialto and then onwards- shopping is a lot cheaper here and you do get to see how the venetians live. I've seen a lot of postings re getting to this hotel it really isn't bad at all- you get the vaporetto Aliguna from the airport buy your ticket in the airport at the ATVO/Alilaguna desk at 10 euros- stay on until St Marco (Valleresso)you can't miss it-takes about 1 hour 20mins.Walk straight up calle valeresso which becomes calle frezzaria and then turn left onto calle barcoli continue toward la fenice toward campo san fantin. Failing all that ask for la fenice (opera house)stand in the square near el teatro restaurant you'll see a tiny burgundy and gold sign for the hotel which is just down a side street. Personally finding it's not half as bad as we thought-the maps in the AA spiral guide to venice werereally good and we used them continously. On reflection we wish we had booked a private water taxi it is costly at about 80 euros but it would have been a really nice way to arrive at the hotels own landing stage. If you are on a budget don't worry the vaporetto is great and I can't ever remember a more fascinating way to get from the airport- it also lets you get your bearings and gives you confidence on the waterbus. Overall a great and beautiful city-like stepping back in time............enjoy - we did !", "Date": "March 16, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "london, UK", "Title": "\u201cLoved it\u201d", "Author": "julianwalker", "ReviewID": "UR4448478", "Content": "I stayed at this Hotel last weekend with my wife for her birthday.

We also got terribly lost trying to find this hotel - the lane it is on is not on the standard Venezia tourist map!
