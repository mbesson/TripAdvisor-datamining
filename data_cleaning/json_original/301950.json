{"Reviews": [{"Content": "Very Good Hotel, But Will Consider Another Establishment For Next Visit I would agree with most of the reviews for the property; the majority of the service staff were exceptionally professional and helpful. I must note, however, that my experience with some of the front desk staff was not positive. On several different occasions, the front desk service were quite rude in their response to my requests. In one instance, I requested a recommendation for a high-end restaurant that served shabu-shabu that was not touristy. Initially, I was directed to a sushi/sashimi restaurant. When I insisted on shabu-shabu, I was given a brochure for a restaurant that looks more like a bad cross between Disneyland and Benihana than a proper dining facility. They insisted that this was the ONLY shabu-shabu restaurant of which they were familiar. Come on! In all of Tokyo??? I ended up not taking any of their recommendations for the rest of my stay. The facilities of the hotel were very good. However, I would rate the polish, fit, finish, and amenities a notch lower than Raffles Hotels that I have visited in Asia. I likely will consider the Park Hyatt, the Ritz Carlton, or another establishment on my next visit to Tokyo.", "Date": "Oct 24, 2008", "ReviewID": "UR191798331", "Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Business service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "4", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "Author": "Lemuel-T"}, {"Content": "Nirvana in hotels This is a wonderful, elegant hotel, with a proud, efficient staff that goes out of their way to ensure your stay is exceptional.

Thus we found this hotel a bit sinister and fled to the amazing Ritz Carlton Tokyo.The only plus is that the hotel offers acceptable prices on it webpage and the webpage of lhw, although given the absence of facilities, the price is no such value for money.

OK where do I even begin. There are so many lovely, wonderful things about this hotel.First, the overall style: if you're looking for high-tech modern skyscrapers like the Park Hyatt, this hotel isn't for you. If you prefer a smaller hotel, with a classic, understated, quiet elegance, where you can relax and leave your stress behind, then don't stay anywhere else.The staff here is wonderful. They are exceptionally courteous, helpful, and welcoming without being the least bit intrusive. If it rains, they have dozens of umbrellas at the door in case you should need one; if you don't speak Japanese and are going somewhere, they will write every detail down for you and make sure you know exactly how to get back to the hotel; if you need a taxi at 5am, no problem. Other hotel staff around the world should come here for lessons!The rooms are very comfortable and so thoughtfully laid out. Every detail was considered, such as a dimmer switch for the bathroom light, buttons next to the bed that allow you to open  close the curtains without having to get up, high-speed internet access in the rooms (there is an extra charge for this),an unusually large marble bathroom with a deep soaking tub and a separate glass enclosed shower; in the dressing area, there's also a built-in vanity where you can dry your hair, put on makeup, etc. They provide robes, slippers, pajamas, an in-room safe, a very good hair dryer (not the wall kind), and wonderful soaps. You feel at home here immediately.The location is great - right in Ginza, near fantastic high-end shopping (bring your savings account) and restaurants. It's also only a short walk to the subway. My only disappointment is that I had to leave! I hope I will have the opportunity to stay here again sometime in the future. I loved this hotel and I'll always remember this special place when I think of Tokyo.

It was a wonderful experience. The staff was attentive, the room was well appointed, the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was great with wonderful scented bath items from Australia (soaps, shampoos, bath gels)- and the scents were changed daily. As others have mentioned, this hotel is in a great location for shopping/sightseeing and is very close to the subway (Ginza line). As a woman alone in Tokyo, I felt very safe at this hotel and the areas around it (I went several places by subway on the Ginza line - and never felt uncomfortable).To comment about the food at the hotel (since others have), I did have the opportunity to dine in the hotel's restaurants. The food was very good, although I was not footing the bill (breakfast was typically $20-$35 USD). As with most hotels, the food elsewhere is generally less expensive, and can be just as good, if not better than the hotel. There are so many restaurants of so many varieties close to this hotel that if price is of concern, just go elsewhere. I ate outside of the hotel for both lunches and dinners. There are many Japanese and Western style restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. In fact, my last morning there I went to a Starbucks to save some time - it was next to the subway station - and had breakfast for $5 USD. There are three large department stores right down the street and the basement levels are FULL of the most fabulous foods, pastries, candies etc. I would highly recommend making one of these stores your first stop when you arrive in Tokyo, so that you can have a frame of reference for price and variety of available foods at very reasonable prices. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Tokyo.

I asked the concierges for recommendations on three different times for a sushi restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, and a noodle shop. I found out later that all the places recommended were all chain stores, and the disappointing fact is that the concierges did not possess a personal knowledge about the restaurants and got the information solely from a big file provided by the management.On a positive note, the bell service of this hotel is the best I ever experienced.

I did not stay at this hotel, but I did dine at the Kitscho Restaurant on it's basement level and the experience was so dismal, I felt compelled to log it here on tripadvisor so hopefully others will not suffer the same fate! It is supposed to be a traditional Japanese Kaiseki feast with multiple fancy courses that are one-of-a-kind and amazing. And the price of over $300 USD per person certainly reflects this. HOWEVER, the food is terrible and of very low quality. Even the sushi was stringy and had obviously been previously frozen. We had had fish that very morning at the infamous Tsujiki Fish Market (where you would think this hotel would get their fish!) and it was a thousand times better. Also, the decor had about as much ambiance as a college dorm cafeteria -- cheap chairs and laminate table, brightly lit up; it was ridiculous. This place supposedly has a good reputation, but it seemed to my husband and I that it was just set up as a tourist trap. They didn't even TRY to make it nice. Just scrimped and saved at every corner to try and cheat their guests and make as much money as possible. Not only did we not enjoy ourselves, or the amount of money we paid (which was actually kind of irrelevant cuz we would have hated it even if it was $5 per person!), we were actually deeply offended and angry when we left. We even considered pretending we were sick so we could just walk out but we ended up slogging through because we felt bad for the waitresses. They were actually very good and courteous - as is the case throughout Japan - so we didn't want to make a scene. But part of me could not help but think they fully knew how bad the food was and what a rip-off it was...maybe they felt bad about it too.
