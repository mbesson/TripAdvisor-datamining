The hotel has beautifully landscaped grounds and contains a lot of recycled materials in its construction; personally I worry about the useful life of the rusty sheets of metal that are sprinkled throughout. the hotel. Our King Spa room was all that we could have desired and the Reception, valet parking and staff serving breakfast were very friendly and helpful throughout our visit. The rooftop pool is a very nice addition to the hotel. Our only real concern was the rather strange dinner menu in the hotel restaurant which consisted of some strange combinations of ingredients with every main course dish which did not appeal to our European palates at all. As a result we did not eat dinner in the hotel at all during our stay. This was not really a problem as there are several other good restaurants within walking distance. Our favourite was Bistro Jeanty which serves excellent French dishes, including the best onion soup starter that I have ever tasted.

The service was really phenomenal as well. Everyone, and I do mean everyone, that we encountered truly had a congenial, can-do attitude.

Actually the night we were heading to Redd Wood was a bit chilly, and the gentleman at the valet offered to give us a quick ride to the restaurant.

Let me begin this review by pointing out I was dreading this Napa trip. Never been before and truly never had any intention of ever going. Why? 2 reasons. I hated the movie Sideways and I just don't like wine. (Ok, Maybe a spritzer.) So the idea of going to a place that was all about making and drinking wine seemed like a total waste of money and time. (Hmmm, a trip to Lynchburg, Tenn for a visit to the Jack Daniels distillery, might be in the works.) So why did I go? My wife wanted to - Enough said. It was amazing! What a win/win for me. The B, as I affectionately call it, was everything and more. The rooms spotless, modern and comfortable. Beds, electronics, accoutrements, etc. everything the other reviewers have described. Customer Service is king (esp Rebecca, Camille & Vinnie on Cocktail Shaker). Anything we might have needed was provided. Any speed bumps we encountered were handled like lightening. Like the guest in the room above who began a loud and vigorous P90X workout. And this guy had stamina, it went on until 10am. One mention of this to the front desk and problem solved. Moved quickly and without hassle. Another big plus was location. We could walk to Bouchon, Bistro Jeanty, and a lovely small market. (They are also happy to drive and pick you up in one of their lovely hybrid Lexus sedans.) And for those of you who like to follow up a day of wine tasting with some heavy duty cocktails...The bar (Lucy's) made some delicious and exotic concoctions.

The rooms are huge and extremely private, there is plenty of room for two people in the bathroom, and then with that indoor/outdoor shower...We definitely wished that we had stayed longer.

It was so adorable that we had to make sure that they were both used before we left.

Our room was very spacious, with a quaint private courtyard, and the best part was the incredible bathroom, jacuzzi and steam shower. We loved relaxing in the jacuzzi and unwinding after a day of wine tasting in with a nice hot steam. The location could not be better - just a short walk to a number of world-class restaurants (Redd, Bottega, French Laundry) and a short drive to Mustards Grill (this and Redd were our two favorite meals of the trip). We loved the free service the hotel provides to all guest - first-rate bikes to tour the wine region, including electric bikes which really helped after hours of cycling on the Silverado Trail. The valets who greeted us every day could not have been nicer and the sommelier at the restaurant was very knowledgeable and friendly. We've stayed at incredible hotels around the world (Relais & Chateaux in several countries including the amazing El Colibri in Cordoba, Argentina and Hotel Explora in Chilean Patagonia), and in terms of design, this hotel was very impressive. Where it fell short, however, was the level of service. We recognize, to be fair, that this may have been due to the fact we went in the \"off season\" for Napa and for the first few days we were one of a few guests at the hotel. Still, we would have liked a \"tour\" of the property upon arrival and an explanation of all the services provided (we were never told, for example, about the free shuttle service to restaurants in the area), and it would have been helpful to know before we arrived that the onsite restaurant was closed for renovation. Room service was very expensive and was spotty (we ordered a cheese and pate platter when we arrived but they forgot to include any bread) with regard to service. We so wanted to fall in love with Bardessono based on all the reviews we had read, but we could only manage to really love the property and say to ourselves, \"if only\" they had not neglected so many little touches that make a stay at this type of hotel so memorable. Forgetting to clean our room (we walked in after a long day of wine tasting to find it was still unmade) was one of those things you just never expect at a place that charges you $500 USD a night. Again, in fairness to the Bardessono, Rachel at the front desk, when she learned about this, immediately told us to go to the bar area and have a drink on the hotel while I room was being cleaned and then sent a plate of delicious homemade cookies to our room later that evening. That was the kind of special touch we'd been hoping for the entire stay, but it came on the final evening. I suspect that we stayed during an \"off\" week at the Bardessono, and that is we returned, things would be more consistent with the other rave reviews it has received (and which we read before booking!).", "Date": "January 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ashburn, VA", "Title": "\u201cIncredibly Relaxing Wonderful Top Notch Experience\u201d", "Author": "lisalisa24", "ReviewID": "UR123335525", "Content": "We travel quite a bit - and have stayed at some wonderful places in Napa/Yountville - and Bardessono was the absolute best for many reasons: 1 - The accomodations - it was SO QUIET and the room is HUGE and accomodating with a sitting area and patio.

The valet boys were very courteous and provided an efficient service. I think it helps that they have radio earpiece. Upon our checkout, the valet offered us bottled waters for our way back. Lexus cars: The hotel has 3 Lexus vehicles which you can borrow for 3 hours for free. Room: Our room was on the 2nd floor and our window was looking the town. Very modern. The floor has no carpet, which I loved about it. It feels very clean and spacious. When you go in, the TV is on with a scenic video, like a screen saver. We turned on the gas fireplace and it felt like we were in a spa. When you turn on the TV, it shows the temperature, your name on and other information. It has a little fridge with complimentary water bottles that are re-stocked every day. The bottles are those like the milk glass bottles with a lid. Washroom & closet: It is separated from the room by a sliding door. Very clean and loved the separate vanities. The washroom/walking closet is very spacious due the spa does an in room service with no extra charge. In Room Spa service: We had a in room massage service. Housekeeping comes and sets the massage beds and puts some candles. The spa staff comes in few minutes after and finishes setting up the spa ambiance: dimmers the lights and putting some music. You can do side by side treatment or separate (one in the room and the other in the walking closet/washroom). At the end of the service, the massage therapist sneaks out of the room, sets on: \"do not disturb\" sign so we can stay lying there until we are ready to get up. Amazing!!

After numerous failed attempts on http://Opentable.com and conventional phone reservations, we knew that we'd have better luck with a nearby hotel concierge booking it for us... and voil\u00c3\u00a0! It worked! Bardessono was able to score us reservations in less than a month a half... granted we knew we'd have to book a room with them first. Onto the actual hotel review: We visited Bardessono back in June 2011 when we ventured into Yountville, while on a weekend trip in Sonoma. We walked around the grounds, wandered into the lobby and knew we had to stay there one day. We admired the uber-modern architecture, heated pool and its how it maintained a small environmental footprint (LEED Platinum certified). Most importantly, we loved how it was practically in the middle of all Thomas Keller's restaurants (French Laundry, Ad Hoc and Bouchon!). Fast forward to 6 months later (mid-Dec) and we check-in for an overnight stay at their King Spa-Suite. Having brought our two french bulldogs, we called earlier to notify that because the hotel concierge had booked lunch reservations at The French Laundry at 11am that same day and that hotel check-in wasn't until 4pm, we had to make arrangements with the dogs. Front desk happily obliged and had made preparations to have the room ready for the dogs to check-in early. They even offered to walk the dogs while we were out. We only have 30 min to drop off the dogs, get situated in the rooms and change into formal attire for lunch. Walking into our room, I was very impressed with the modern facilities. There was a steam shower, a jacuzzi that fit two people side-by-side, outdoor patio with seating, separate room with a queen sized bed, and so much more! Knowing that we'd bring our dogs, the hotel laid out two dog bowls and plush dog beds. The $125 dog cleaning fee was a little steep but for the quality of the service, it was justifiable. Valet parking (Free!) was mandatory and relatively efficient. After coming back from a 4 hour lunch, we came back to the hotel with two well-behaved (and sleeping dogs). The front desk took them out for a nice stroll so that was a huge bonus. We spent the night relaxing in front of the fireplace. At night, we realized we forgot the boys dog food, so we made a run to the local pet food store. The hotel had a promotion with Lexus that provided a free car rental service to use a 2012 Lexus RX450h. We took that to downtown Napa (15 min. away) and didn't have to pay for gas upon return. Around 10pm, we ordered room service. It had a decent selection (hamburgers, sandwiches, desserts, alcohol, etc.) at typical prices ($16 for hamburger, etc). Delivery was also quick (i.e., took about 20 min max for food to arrive). Overall, we found Bardessono to be a world-class hotel. They were incredibly accommodating! Free internet was a plus! We've stayed at Ritz Carltons, Intercontinental Hotels and The Waldorf=Astoria and we were highly dissapointed that, even while charging $500+/night, wireless internet would still cost $15! Car service with Lexus was also a plus. In the end, we would definitely recommend the hotel for those are willing to pay for top-notch service or for those who want to experience the best in Yountville (who can hook up French Laundry reservations!!). The bill came out to be about $750 for one night. That includes the dog overnight service, 14% tax and $70 of room service. Anytime that we stay in Napa, we'll definitely make Bardessono our #1 choice!", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cA perfect hotel for relaxing and luxury!\u201d", "Author": "Cynthiaplfung", "ReviewID": "UR121525704", "Content": "The hotel is beautiful, serene and very hospitable.

I suggest starting the steam because it takes about 10 to 15 minutes to get going, while thats producing, draw a bath and use the bath salts in the room, trust me. After the bath has been drawn, enter the steam shower for about twenty minutes or longer if you desire, then immerse yourselves in the bath and turn on the jets and let it run through the cycle. Get back in the shower and use the spa soap provided and I promise you euphoria will follow.

The people who manage this hotel are true hoteliers, an ever endangered species in this world of budget hotels and the race to the bottom of rate. One of my longtime hospitality marketing friends, back east, makes a joke - \"The problem with hospitality nowadays is that there is so little of it.\" In our current industry, it seems that there are less dyed in the wool hotel operators, and more outsiders or non-hospitality people, running the industry. It's wonderful to be able to stay somewhere run by people who \"get\" it. Bardessono is for the discerning traveler who wants the best possible experience while traveling. Bardessono has knocked it out of the park. It's a rare experience to see such solid operations and happy, accessible, approachable staff. I think the team on property and Benchmark Hospitality should be very proud of what they have accomplished. It's a rare gem... even more rare because of the Platinum rating. I am involved in three LEED Gold props, and know how difficult it is to design, build, and open a top tier world class luxury resort, without calling attention to the obvious limitations and subtler finishes required by LEED, let alone a Platinum ratings. It's an unbelievable accomplishment, and I doubt we will see too many more of them. It's so subtle, and they made it work to their advantage. The delicate and light use of Eastern influences, coupled with the warm approach to open and flowing interior design, is so inviting, you are almost instinctively led on a property tour simply by how it exists. The Pool Deck is one of the most glamorous I have ever been to, anywhere in the world... it is a place to cherish, and take full advantage of - including your personal cabana boy who can shuttle beverages to and from the barkeep. This is also a dog friendly hotel in a way that no other hotel has ever been... it's amazing, but the dog's can, basically, go anywhere humans can go, without infringing on the other guests. You can dine in the open air patio of the restaurant, so dinner with the pooch is an option as well. From the garden, to the rooms, lobby, bar, and more.... it's a special getaway for the pooch, although the pet fee can run a bit steep. It's probably worth it if you are going to visit for more than a day or two. Finally, their Sunday night special which includes a room and 4 course dinner (with wine pairings in our case), is probably the most incredible deal you will ever find on a romantic night away. It's pretty astonishing... and I suggest you take them up on it before they stop being so generous. =) Hope this review helps you make up your mind! I was *SOOO* skeptical about the value versus the rate. In the end, as a cheap hospitality guy, I would actually have paid more.

While in your room you really do get the feel of being away from it all as not once did I hear noise from the outside or surrounding rooms. Also the layout of the rooms especially with the fireplace really does give a romantic feel. The service was great as we often went down to bother to hotel staff on recommendations from restaurants in the area to short driving locations and we were not disappointed with any of their suggestions. One experience to note is that every morning I woke up early to go for a quick jog around, after I finished I grabbed a paper and went into the restaurant where to grab a coffee as I waited for my wife to wake up. Not once was I ever charged for my morning coffee which I thought was really nice of them to do. The hotel itself was in a great location where it was only a couple minute walk to a number of great restaurants and shops. My wife enjoyed the spa treatments that they offered while I enjoyed the outdoor pool. However there always has to be atleast one negative for every review in order to remain objective. In the case of the Bardessono it would have to be the price.

You know when a place has \"it\" and you realize how rare that is. Bardessono has it! Rooms: The rooms are spacious, modern, clean and highly functional. While modern is not my preferred architectural style the rooms here pull it off very well. The bathrooms are HUGE and well designed and the bedrooms are large and comfortable. Our room had a sofa (which was a day-bed if you needed it), a fireplace, a large flat-screen television and an incredibly comfortable bed. The room also had a huge deck with two sitting areas. Service: The folks who work here must really like their jobs because you can't fake the authentic, friendly service this hotel offered. From the front desk to the bar (my wife and I agree that Sara is possibly the best bartender in the state) to the spa the staff here is top-notch. This staff rates with Mandarin Las Vegas and Four Seasons Punta Mita as the best service staff I have ever encountered at a hotel. They are young, friendly, professional and eager to please. Kudos to the management for both selection and training! Location: As the title says this place is literally in the middle of Yountville, but feels secluded and private. About as perfect as a location can be. One is a three minute walk to the heart of Yountville, which is a perfect base for a trip to the valley. Simply put the location is perfect! Physical facility: The designers of this place got it all right. The facility is highly functional and beautiful! The pool is on top of the spa building (which is very cool) and the bar looks out over the grounds and a cool little pool/pond. The spa was nice (the only draw-back was the size of the men's locker room. . .about big enough for two people to share) and the massage I got was very good. Restaurant/Bar: In Yountville there are some of the best restaurants in the state. Given that fact this restaurant has a bit further to go. We had dinner here Sunday night and it was very good, just not great. It will need to be great to compete. The bar, however, was great! Good wine list (not great. . .especially for Napa) accompanied by excellent bartenders and friendly guests makes for a fantastic place to grab a pre-dinner cocktail! Value: As one might expect this is an expensive hotel. We felt the value was there based on the quality of the experience. At this price point things need to be nearly perfect. . .and they were.

Location! Location! You can't get better than the Bardessono. It is within walking distance of some of the best eateries at Yountville. Everything is a close car or bike ride away. The spa suite is nice, but definitely not worth the price tag. My friend and I got a great deal and we decided to splurge. Otherwise it's not worth what you get in return. The comforters on the beds are just heavenly. However, the beds are very firm. If you like pillowtop mattresses, this isn't going to be the right place for you. The blinds are a nice touch, but they get annoying early in the morning. My friend went out for a jog and when she came back the blinds automatically go up and woke me up. The double tub is really nice and the shower is great too! There are in room massage tables should you fancy a nice spa treatment. Staying on the first floor when there is another suite above you is horrible. You can hear every footstep and every stumble up and down the stairs. I can't call it true R&R unless I can get a full night sleep. The grounds and decor of this resort is amazing! Everywhere we went make a great backdrop for photos! It's definitely beautiful! We adored the cabanas at the pool. If you get tired of going to wineries, spend some time at a cabana and pamper yourself. You can order food or drinks there and they have all the things you need to have a good time: beach balls, water loungers to sit in the pool, and sun block. The pool staff are very courteous and stop by every 30 minutes to ask if you need a refill or more water. They also can help hold your cabana for you if you promise to return quickly. The restaurant at the resort is actually great for breakfast and lunch! We really enjoyed our meals there and it didn't cost an arm and a leg like the rest of the resort. We took a Lexus SUV hybrid out. There are 2 of them available for 3 hour blocks. The resort also offers Lexus car service for anywhere in Yountville. I got really annoyed that on the way to dinner, the concierge couldn't make that car service available on a saturday night. She said that there's only 1 valet. Usualy there are 3-4 valets any given time. How can they possibly have just 1 on the busiest night of the week? On the way home, I called the front desk and of course they made the ride happen.

Upon arrival we were upgraded to one of their Tufa suites - concrete/tile floor living room with a gas fireplace through to the king sized bedroom, an amazing bathroom with a champagne jacuzzi tub and steam shower that had an entrance to an outdoor shower and a great patio with deck chairs and a small bistro table. The electronic shades (controllable from inside) were just too cool. The fireplace took the chill out of the air each morning and made for some cozy evenings. We enjoyed room service breakfast each morning and fell in love with their coffee! The roof top pool was a quiet and comfortable place to relax with some mid afternoon snacks and beverages. We opted for their in-suite couples massage and were completely impressed. The staff were phenomenal - professional and accommodating. We were greeted several times by staff that not only knew our names, but that wished us a happy anniversary each time they saw us. The location of the property is excellent as well - literally walking distance to all of the haute cuisine Yountville has to offer and only minutes from the highway for quick drives to downtown Napa. We walked to the Maisonry tasting room and spent hours in the art gallery sampling some of their wines from 16 different vintners. Bardessono's prices are a bit steep but after a 5 day stint, sparing nothing and just letting ourselves be pampered and loved - we do not regret spending a penny.

As evidenced by several positive reviews, many - especially those with carefree money to spend - will undoubtedly have a wonderful experience at this property, and my new bride and I had a good one. But the experience could have been better, and for the price, it should have been much better. My wife and I don't splurge like this too often, but when we do, we expect the best and usually get it. I've tried to highlight both the good and not-so-good below: SLEEP QUALITY Liked: Bed was clean and comfortable. Outside traffic noises and those between rooms seemed minimal. Easy to set a wake-up call on the slick IP phones. Didn't like: We slept poorly here. Some part of the bedding material made a notable amount sound when moved, which we both found odd and distracting. We were awoken multiple times by the sound of running water, possibly from a leak in the toilet bowl or tub faucet? The room blinds have a gap that allows a fair amount of light in after sunrise. The AC seemed to make no sound whatsoever, so those accustomed to sleeping with white noise will need another source. Occasionally heard high heels on concrete outside walkways. LOCATION Liked: Easy walking distance to great restaurants, such as Bottega, Hurley's, Bistro Jeanty and Thomas Keller's places. Easy drive to Brix, Mustard's, and plenty of wineries. Away from the main roads, reducing traffic noise. Didn't like: The in-town placement doesn't lend itself to a complete wine country getaway. During our visit, a B&B across the street was doing a noisy remodel during the day, and a neighboring property did some brief jackhammering (neither the fault of the Bardessono). Some views are of streets and/or parking lots. PROPERTY Liked: The contemporary architecture distinguishes it from many other lodgings in the area. The common areas were very clean. Open-air spaces brought in sunshine and fresh air, while retained original trees, water features, and plenty of new landscaping softened the edges of the bold design. Spacious vehicle entryway and valet area for a no-fuss loading and unloading (appreciated in California). Absolutely, positively don't miss the full-service toilets in the area near the bar... Didn't like: Some of the spaces felt cold and unfriendly due to the bold lines/materials and in some cases, lack of shade. They've made the design decision to allow the natural woods to fade and the metals to rust; interesting, but not necessarily attractive. Art appreciation is of course quite subjective, but we simply found the wall art unattractive. Some paths to common areas led past the welcome area, valets, dining room hostess, or other personnel, leading me to occasionally wish for a little more freedom to move about without being greeted constantly. Gardening maintenance in some areas appeared to be lacking, with weed growth or lack of crispness; the property garden was unattractive during my visit. A space behind the dining room that was suggested for our wedding gathering had flypaper dangling nearby... ROOM Liked: The huge bathroom was amazing, from the jacuzzi tub, to the steam shower, the large wardrobe, separate sink areas, good lighting, access to the outdoor shower, etc. The suite was very spacious, and the fireplace area was very attractive. All the technology was very nice, although we did find ourselves fussing over some of the features occasionally. The large patio area was like being at home. Didn't like: Unattractive, cheap-looking rug and dark-teal sofa. Cold florescent lighting on stark white walls. Power blinds were cool at first, then a bit annoying in their fussiness. With hard floors throughout, sounds carry easily. Bathroom door didn't seem to close properly. Outside entry to room featured unhidden ugly pipes, fire extinguisher, and/or other infrastructure. Despite assurances that neighbors couldn't see the outdoor shower area, we had line of sight to a neighboring balcony; staff assured us they would move anyone in that room to avoid privacy issues. SERVICE Liked: We were greeted by name when we first arrived, and many of the staff remembered our names throughout our stay. We were married during our visit, and many took the time to congratulate us, comment nicely, etc. The time between calling the concierge and help of any kind appearing at the door could often be measured in seconds, literally. Whether it was gardening of our patio, set-up of glassware for an in-suite gathering, or extra housekeeping requests, personnel were prompt, friendly and skilled. Communication and coordination among staff was great; a request to the overnight personnel had good follow-through the next day. The pool service was great and friendly; I could get used to someone handing me Champagne while I float in the pool! Didn't like: We'd very well socialized in advance that we were going to be married on our suite patio, but upon arrival, the gardening of that area was sorely lacking. The plants were very overgrown, and one weed grew as high as my head! By phone, the concierge desk leaned too far toward cool and professional for my taste; I prefer a little more warmth. The desk was also a bit awkward in person. Each time we went by the area, two staff members were busily typing and answering calls; walk-ups didn't seem welcome, no greetings were given and our hellos were missed/ignored. We were told that coffee was complimentary at the bar each morning, but after making us an espresso, the bartender told us she'd comp us for our wedding day; we have to assume espressos aren't free, or we missed the cutoff time. SPA Liked: Having a very relaxing couples massage in our own suite, with blinds closed, fireplace going, soothing music. Very sweet, skilled masseuses. Friendly explanations by phone of the spa offerings. Didn't like: Although skeptical of the package, we paid extra to have a bath drawn for after the massage. One masseuse had to keep going to fuss with the tub to draw the bath, which was a bit distracting and reduced the time of the massage itself. We went straight to the tub after the massages, and found that the water was cold, and had to re-draw the bath ourselves. We paid for a spa pkg deal, but found it impossible to use our full credit without paying even more out of pocket, due to significant inflexibility in the spa's rules. We ended up leaving the credit unspent instead, which was frustrating. POOL Liked: Views of the surrounding valley from both ends of the pool. Free cabanas and pool floats. During our visits, it was kid-free and quiet, with a Euro-chic feel. Pool staff were very attentive. Didn't like: The pool staff requested $20 corkage to bring wine to the pool area. Bees and other debris were sometimes floating in the pool. One small jacuzzi seems a bit lacking. FOOD Liked: After hours, the restaurant went above and beyond to allow me to order from the full menu, and we had one of the best fish dishes I've had in my life. Swordfish sandwiches by the pool were good. Great breads, including one from Bouchon Bakery. Some items were served on sustainably harvested materials, and the staff was trained to explain it. Didn't like: Some portions were small for the prices. Room service has the usual delivery charges on top of the included gratuity. MANAGEMENT Liked: A manager gave me his complete, undivided attention to listen to some of my concerns about the stay. He seemed genuinely sorry for the less-than-perfect experience, and interested in improving. Some credit was applied to help compensate; if not for this, I would have rated the property/experience lower. The manager also engaged the general manager, who later approached me to apologize, and warmly encouraged an ongoing relationship with the property. Didn't like: The partial credit for our stay was mishandled upon checkout, leading to some awkwardness in bringing this to management's attention, then waiting for an extended period for it to be corrected.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brussels, BE", "Title": "\u201cLoved the Hotel, but so so concierge\u201d", "Author": "NewbieTubes", "ReviewID": "UR114625279", "Content": "Bardessono is a romantic get-away for couples.

Yes, we were offered our choice of a welcome drink, but was not shown around the property's facilities. The Ritz and Aman showed us around and told us where we can go and spend our time apart from wine tasting. Yes, we were offered complimentary bottles of water to drink, but was offered a pathetic packet of roasted almonds as a welcome treat. Yes, we had a room so spacious, but the pillow choices gave me and my husband some uncomfortable sleepless nights. Yes, the garden was beautiful, but the facilities, like the lazy hammock, were not even clean---could have used one lazy afternoon after a steak of wine-tasting to doze off or read a book. Yes, the modern restaurant is inviting, but did not have an atmosphere like Redd. C'mon, my husband and I would at least have some complimentary coffee in the mornings. Napa Valley Lodge at least offers comps for breakfast. Yes, the bathroom had the built-in steam room mechanism embedded in the separate shower, but it is a steam room adrift off the pipes where the steam supposedly comes from. Yes, the shower room is separate from the superb tub, but the shower hub would have been better off as a rainshower model. Even H2 Hotel in Healdsburg, another \"green\" hotel has got an excellent rainshower. Yes, the room is like one taken off a Bond novel, but there should have been a remote to control all the fixtures while I and my husband dream off----you know, where we do not have to get off the bed to turn off the fireplace, or the bedroom lights, etcetera. Great shop as well. But the only time we chose to come in, the shop attendant was busy at the phone conversing with another Gossip Girl. And we understand Bardessono even gives Hill Family Estate Winery the privilege to use the property for their wine launch parties, so why can't guests like us have some complimentatry bottles (or bottle) of their fine wines on the first night stay?

We loved it the first time around, and it keeps getting better with every stay. The LEED Platinum certification is impressive, but it should be said that the \"green\" nature of the hotel sure doesn't get in the way of comfort and luxury. The modern design is remarkably cool & beautiful, with the mixed use of natural and man-made materials resulting in a very high-end yet pleasant vibe across the board. The rooms are huge and the appointments are super comfortable. Our suite had a double-sided fireplace, a steam shower, jacuzzi tub, outdoor shower, plenty of private patio space outside to lounge in. Short of an insanely opulent trip to Mexico for our wedding, I've never set foot in a nicer room - no joke. The restaurant serves great grub, and the bartenders really know how to make a cocktail. Being a cocktail snob (sorry, the Burritt Room and 15 Romolo in SF have ruined me for life), there's nothing more refreshing than bartenders who make a proper drink not only using the right ingredients, but the correct techniques too. The hotel isn't exactly cheap, but we felt like we absolutely got our money's worth (or more) by the time we left. What really helps from an emotional standpoint is that they don't nickel & dime you for things. Examples: valet parking is free. Bike \"rentals\" are free. Filtered water in-room is free. For these same things at the Fairmont Sonoma Mission Inn & Spa, a couple would be charged ~$100 ($25/day parking, $6.50/bottle of water, $30/day for a bike). All in all, we couldn't recommend Bardessono enough.

My husband and I have been to Napa Valley many times, previously having stayed at Auberge du Soleil, Calistoga Ranch, the Yountville Inn, and in a condo in Napa. Yountville is my favorite place to stay because of the many restaurants in walking distance and its relatively central location to most of the wineries we visit. The Bardessono is a wonderful addition to Yountville, and we definitely enjoyed our stay. Our likes included: (1) Spacious rooms--we had a Tufa Suite and our mothers had a Queen Spa Suite with 2 queen beds. Nice sized bathrooms, too. (2) Modern, clean decor--we enjoyed the design aesthetic, though we can understand that others might find it a bit too spartan/minimalist. (3) Location, location, location--superb location, just a short walk from all of our favorite haunts in Yountville, including the Bouchon bakery across the street, and Ad Hoc, Bistro Jeanty, and Redd all just a short walk away. (4) Very dog friendly--our dog loved it, and this was our first time traveling with him (a 100 pound Rigeback). We had a doggie bed, water bowl, and blanket waiting for him on our arrival, and the staff was always happy to help with anything we needed to accommodate him. (5) Service--the service was great. Anything we wanted, we got. We did have one snafu with coffee being delivered after too long a wait one morning, but that was our only complaint. I didn't feel well one night, and the staff even offered to fix me something on the house from the kitchen. Things we didn't like: (1) Restaurant--the restaurant is very pricey and doesn't have a lot of options. Breakfast was pretty limited, and extremely expensive--$19 for an omelette is a little extreme, especially when it just isn't that big. Dinner is pre-fixe, though they did try very hard to accommodate our special needs, but it didn't quite compare to any of the many restaurants in town. We tried to avoid eating here, frankly, after our 1st dinner and breakfast. (2) Spa--the facility, itself, doesn't exist. It's just a restroom and treatment room. I think they hope that people will do treatments in their rooms, which is part of the reason for the design of the rooms, but my husband and our mothers definitely didn't feel like they got a true spa experience. The treatments, themselves, were fine, though, they told me. (I don't do spa at all, myself, so I could care less.) (3) Bathroom clothing storage/towels--we realize it's a green hotel, but for these rates we expect green to still be luxurious. The towels were just shy of being pathetic for these room rates. I realize recycled is good, but they reminded us of towels from a Holiday Inn. Not good! We want green in a luxury format, or else we happily sacrifice green to get the luxury! We also wish there had been more storage drawers/shelves in the bathroom for our clothing. All in all, we were very pleased with the Bardessono. I certainly expect that we will stay there again.

The staff is outstanding, very presentable and very friendly and extremely helpful, made as feel very welcome and at home. the place is surrounded with wineries which we went for a tour that was just great. shopping is also close by. if you are looking for a get away from the cities for a romantic event or just for relaxation this is the place to be, it appeals to ladies for the beauty and relaxation and the guys will enjoy that too along with the environment friendly technology that the place is built on making it modern and up to date with a homey and warm look. highly recommended.", "Date": "November 12, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Swanton, Ohio, USA", "Title": "\u201cBest service I've ever experienced\u201d", "Author": "jeffled1134", "ReviewID": "UR86637118", "Content": "I stayed at Bardessono for the second half of my honeymoon.

We did Bottega (good), Bouchon (good) and Bouchon bakery (incredible!!!) around town.

On the positive side the hotel is located right in the middle of Yountville so you can walk to all of the restaurants, however you get no view whatsoever of any vineyards. Also I appreciate their LEED effort, which they have done quite well, but feel they need to put more effort into actual guest services. I have to agree with many of the comments posted by the Sydney couple. The concierge staff is not so much rude as totally incompetent and just not very knowledgeable or helpful, especially concerning vineyards. We asked about a vineyard designed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron and they made us reservations at a vineyard they thought was called Coyote (it was actually called Quixote, like Don Quixote) and was designed by the Vienesse artist Hundertwasser, which couldn't be more different than what we were looking for. When you are paying $825.00 a night you expect the concierge to be a valuable source of information and to be able to get you into restaurants and vineyards and have some inside connections. Not only were there no connections the concierge were fairly clueless, we had better restaurant recommendations from the bartender at the hotel. The rooms have absolutely no view as said in previous posted comments, so one would never use the balconies- they face parking lots and solar panels and the backs of other rooms. Since the fronts of the rooms are glass walls, there is little privacy unless you have the shutters down, thus eliminating any natural light. A bottle of complimentary wine was left in our room but the dirty glasses from the first day just sat for 2 days until I wrote a note asking them to bring clean ones. The maid service was really not up to par, especially for this expensive a hotel. Also breakfast was not included. At that price that also seemed quite outrageous. The great bakery Bouchon is across the street, they could have offered complimentary coffee, tea and croissants from them at the very least. There seemed to be many other places in Yountville itself and around the area that offered far greater value for the price.

We spent the first half of our vacation at Hotel Luca and the second half in an Elevated King Suite at Hotel Bardessono. The character, service and personality of Hotel Bardessono didn't bode well for us; At it's core, Hotel Bardessono is a pretentious hotel whose allegiance are the wealthy. My wife and I are young, successful entrepreneurs. We are in our late twenties / early thirties, and we didn't really \"fit\" in. We were the youngins', and our experience was a feeling of disadvantage. We arrived at dinner before several couples, but we were last ones served. Service was remarkably short, and we weren't offered a wine menu until we asked for one. We arrived at the bar along side several another couples; we walked in and sat down before them, but we were last ones served. Concierge was nice, but they didn't really spend quality time helping us plan our days. They would bounce back and forth from the phone, to other guest questions and then need to be reminded about the questions we originally had. (A quick side note to say thank you to Kevin, though. He was the only one who really showed outstanding service. Thank you, Kevin!) Other than Kevin, service at this hotel appears to be relevant to your image, in our experience. If you look like you have money you will likely be treated like a king. If you don't, well -- who knows. There are a few other notes that may be worth mentioning: 1) There are rooms which have showers outside. These are their most expensive rooms, I believe. Be careful with these rooms. The Elevated King Suite is on the second floor, and the rooms with showers are on the first floor. The angle of the shower exposes you to those who walk down the stairs. We could clearly see the shower. Nobody was using it, but it is sold as a more elite experience...so be careful if you plan on using it. 2) The Elevated King Suites have a view of the parking lot or some condos, that are under construction, in the back. You would expect to have a view slightly more appealing than a parking lot when you pay almost $800 a night for a hotel. 3) The food is not that great, and the presentation is forced to meet the hotels elite yet minimal standards. Don't let the presentation masquerade the taste of the food. Save your night and walk a block down the road to REDD. You won't regret it. Finally, make sure to check out the pool. It is the best pool in Yountville. If you are looking for a luxury hotel that will truly treat you like a king, though, go to Hotel Luca.

Style First off, this is a modern hotel with a very modern/contemporary architecture. If you don't like that, don't stay here. If you prefer a Victorian B&B with frilly curtains and such, this is not for you. We loved it. Comfort/Function The bed was very comfortable, as was the room. It had all of the amenities we wanted. The patio area was great. We were in Room 204, which was a lower level, however, we had privacy because our particular room did NOT have a suite above us. I'd read that some thought these were not private, but ours was. The patio was enclosed and had a table and 2 chairs, as well as 2 lounging chairs with ottomans. It was very comfortable, and nice to eat breakfast at and/or drink wine in the evening. The bathroom is huge as others have said. There are 2 closets, which was very nice and there was room to store both of our suitcases in the closets. In addition, the bathroom was large enough to house the 5 cases of wine that we purchased. Spa My husband did a manly facial and 90 minute massage. I did a 30 minute massage with a polish and wrap and a facial. We both enjoyed it. We did these services at the spa, not the room. I loved the Clarita products, and my husband loved the Dr. Alkaitis. The pool was great. Try to spend at least a couple of afternoons there. Beautiful mountain view and plenty of cabanas/beds available. Try the Moscow Mules (a Napa kind of version of a Mojito, I guess). Food We ate breakfast at the hotel dining room every day, except one when we ordered room service. The Croque Madames were AMAZING. They are obviously very high in calories, but an excellent \"base\" for a day of wine tasting! Room service was prompt and actually fairly affordable. We never had dinner at the restaurant, but we did have a light snack at the pool - chips and guac (great!) and a light snack outside the bar (cheese plate and the Iberican ham - very good!). The outside areas are beautiful and it is great to eat outside at Bardessono. We ate dinner at Bouchon, Ad Hoc, Bistro Jeanty, Hurley's, and Redd. We chose to walk to dinner every night, which was great. I highly recommend the location of this hotel. Ad Hoc was amazing. It was sirloin the night we went. This was our favorite restaurant and we highly recommend. Bouchon was noisy and crowded/tight, but our food was great. The sommelier was very helpful, and we had beet salad (loved it), lamb (great!), short ribs (very good, but I did like the lamb better), and hot brownies with almond ice cream (yum!). Excellent service, we loved our waiter. Redd - we did the tasting menu and wine pairings. Great! Definitely recommend this. Good service, but not as good as Bouchon. Bistro Jeanty was great, more casual. Our service was a little slow, but we did sit outside. We had the tomato soup (one of my favorite foods on the whole trip), butter lettuce salad, lamb (good, but not as good as Bouchon), duck (really good). Recommend this place as well. As for Hurley's, it was good, but compared to these amazing places, it was just average. I had the salmon, good, but just not the caliber of these others. I probably would have repeated another restaurant this night or gone to Bottega. Hurley's does have a really nice, pretty patio (we sat inside) that would be very nice to have a casual meal or drink. We had lunch one day at Rutherford Grill - highly recommend. We had the enchiladas (amazing) and a Hack salad (chicken). Wine We did 2 days of wine touring with Bruce Conard of Wine Country Safari. We highly recommend Bruce. We did rent a car for the week, but it was great to have Bruce do the planning and driving. Do not go with Bruce if you want to go to a lot of tacky, overpopulated wineries where people are getting drunk and wine is mass produced. DO go with Bruce if you want a unique experience and want to taste and buy wine that you will not be able to buy back home. We loved every place we went and almost always met the winemakers. It was an amazing experience and now we have wonderful memories associated with the wine and every person we met. Price ranges were $20 - $100. We bought 5 cases and had all but 1 checked as baggage on Delta - we bought wine shipping boxes. It was a great way to do it. The wineries we went to were mostly by appointment. White Cottage Ranch, Siduri, Boeschen, Bremer, Benovia, V Madrone, Raymond Burr (gorgeous place for a picnic), Martinelli, Acorn, and David Cafforo are the wineries we went to over 2 days. We also walked to the tasting rooms at Cornerstone and Somerston in Yountville - very good and close. We had a wonderful experience and will be back. I wouldn't have changed anything about our trip.

I am not typically a b&b traveller, so bardessono, with it's clean architecture and modern amenities that were superb but not stuffy, was perfect. It's located in Yountville, which is north of Napa, and close to multiple vineyards in the area. On a day without traffic, it's an easy 70 minute drive from San Fran, however next time I would consider flying into Oakland to avoid bridge traffic. Yountville is a smaller town, but it's beautiful. There are flowering plants everywhere; it's very accommodating to walkers/joggers; it has top notch restaurants; and it's a bit more secluded from the main drag going through all the surrounding areas. I chose a spa elevated suite at the resort/hotel. I'm glad I got a room on the 2nd floor; even though I didn't see any of the other rooms from the inside, they seemed as if the ground floor suites might be a little claustrophobic outside in some areas. We were checked in very efficiently, and taken to a room nearby. It was gorgeous. I felt, the entire time, like I was staying in my own house. Past the small entry way is a large bathroom to the left and a large living space to the right. The living space was clean and modern, with fantastic lighting, a plasma screen TV, and a gas fireplace. It also had a large sitting couch and a sizeable deck off the living area. The deck views leave a bit to be desired because all the roofs are flat and have solar panels; but I didn't really mind this. The bathroom was as large as the whole living area. It featured a space for a hide away massage table, as well as two large wardrobes. Vanities were situation opposite each other (there were 2), a huge soaking jetting tub stood under a large private window, and the shower was glass enclosed. The room attendants were like choufes! We never saw them! Even when we were away for 20 minutes, they managed to sneak in, tidy up and replace our water. The resort provides free triple distilled water in old style milk-like containers to your mini bar a few times a day. Every night at turn down, there is a new bottle with a fruit wedge next to the bed. You feel perfectly at home. Unfortunately I did not have an opportunity to take advantage of the spa services (they were booked in the short time I was there), but they now have a small spa if the guest desires service outside the room (which I appreciated). The staff was superbly friendly. The bar attached to the restaurant is definitely a good stop for a cocktail. The recipes are very inventive; I had a cocktail with citrus vodka, homemade gum liquor, lemon juice, and a pinot noir top - it was amazing. I didn't have a chance to enjoy the restaurant, opting to dine at Bouchon across the street instead (fantastic - must go!). The only drawbacks were the mini bar and inroom dining - from my perspective. The mini bar only had water. Because there are not really \"stores\" a-plentiful around that area, I expected at least something to be stocked in the room (especially when you get back from a day of wine tasting and want a snack!). Also the in room dining menu is fairly limited, and gets more limited as the night goes on. Snacking after dinner is not really an option (although wine is available and some very small other items). Obviously this can be worked around as long as you know in advance. All in all, I was extremely sad to leave bardessono and will definitely be back soon.", "Date": "May 22, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Herts", "Title": "\u201cValley Gem\u201d", "Author": "sd1968", "ReviewID": "UR64263269", "Content": "Best new find of 2010 for my wife and I.

The hotel is situated in \"downtown\" Yountville and is within very easy walking distance of a lot of great restaurants including Bouchon, Bottega, Redd (we dined at these three) and also ad hoc and French Laundry (where we did not dine). On our fourth night we ate at the Hotel's restaurant which ended up being our favorite dinner of the four we had in Yountville -the atmosphere is contemporary, the service was professional and the meal was excellently executed and creative - the chef did a good job of preparing the food with bright and fresh flavors and sauces that were more on the light and clean side rather than heavy and cream based . We also had breakfast each morning at the hotel's restaurant - it was included in our rate but I'm not sure that it is typically included - it was quiet good with a large variety of choices and good (blue bottle) coffee and a selection of teas. I read other reviews on tripadviosr that expressed some mild dissatisfaction with the hotels dining room.... our experience was the opposite; we really enjoyed the breakfasts, our dinner, and had excellent service. Bardessono (along with the other hotels and the restaurants in Yountiville) is just a handful of blocks off of Route 29, the main road running N and S through Napa Valley; consequently, we could hear a bit of traffic noise from our balcony (not loud, but a muffled background noise that probably will only bother those very sensitive to noise). However, we did not notice any traffic noise during the night. We did not use the spa services, so I cannot comment on them. Also, we did not use the pool since the weather was unseasonably cold. There is free valet parking --- three of the four nights we parked right outside of the hotel property on the street just because we thought it would be easier.

Rooms were a very nice size, and beautifully furnished. The green features were very nice and intriguing, but the motion sensors weren't perfect - when I was working in my room, the blinds would occasionally decide to lower themselves. The ability to have an in-room spa treatment was wonderful, and the treatment itself was very good. Linens, etc. were generally very good - the robe and towels were a bit lighter weight than I was used to, but that probably is in keeping with the environmental theme of the property. The free water and wireless internet was a welcome touch, and the high-tech docking station was very nice. Unfortunately, except for the wireless internet, business services are pretty much non-existent at the property - of course, this resort is meant for relaxation rather than work, but the in-room desk was prohibitively small, and the only way to print something out was to ask to borrow one of the concierge's computer for a while. If there's a chance you may have to work while on-property, be prepared. We ate on property a few times and were very impressed with the food and the restaurant / lounge service. The chef is really taking some risks with the menu and some flavor combinations and pulling it off beautifully - we loved the dinner that we had on-property, and even thought that it was a tiny bit better than Redd (which was also impeccable). The lounge had a good cocktail program, and seemed to have a lot of local buzz (which makes sense, I suppose - if you live in the area, non-wine focused bars may be a bit hard to come by). The location is perfect if you want to be in walking distance of the valley's best restaurants and a number of great wine bars. That's exactly what we wanted, and we were very happy with the location. There was a bit of noise from the elementary school across the street and from local construction - it wasn't too bad, but if you're looking for a rustic retreat, this may not be the place for you. The check-in service was fine and the bell and valet staff were superb - I can't say enough good things about them.

At some hotels, all the fancy buttons can get complicated, but not at Bardessono. Everything was easy to operate. - there's a mini-fridge in the room. Each day, there are bottles of filtered water bottles (glass) in there for you. They always gave us 4 (there were 2 of us). - I like extra firm bed, which theirs were not, but it was fine. - the beds are not set side by side. There is a partition between the beds, which is nice. The 2nd bed is in its own little \"room\" w/ no door w/ its own tv. - the fireplace is not that big, but it warmed up the room very well. - we thought the heating system was very efficient. There were no cold spots in the room. The temp felt even all throughout the room. - the bathroom was beyond huge. Plenty of closet space (his/hers). Dual sink. Soaking tub is super deep. - the lounge chairs in the patio are nice. But no heat lamp to keep you toasty. THE POOL They keep it at what I think is the perfect temperature. At least 80 degrees for sure. You can jump right in, you don't have to go in a bit at a time. - good for lap swim. Comfortably fits 2 lap lanes, 3 doable. - the jacuzzi is small. And very hot. I would say it fits 2. You can fit 4, but you won't be able to spread out. BIKES The bikes are complimentary of the hotel. You are taken over to the \"bike garage\", where you will be outfitted w/ a nice bike. There is a nice bike path that runs right next to the hotel. SERVICE Overall, service was efficient, polished, personable. High marks for that. HOW GREEN Well, it's pretty green. The place is heated/cooled by many geothermal wells (I think over 80) & of course solar panels. Furnishings are made from reclaimed materials such as wood & steel. The rooms have energy-saving motion sensors to detect room occupancy, lights will go off automatically.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Chicago, IL", "Title": "\u201cTop-notch hotel, great location\u201d", "Author": "Sunshine2006", "ReviewID": "UR50833051", "Content": "I just returned from a great stay at Bardessono.

The design was amazing - loved all of the high-tech details and the fireplace in the room that starts with a flick of the switch. I think the wi-fi was free and there was no charge for phone calls, local or long distance. The steam shower was also a nice feature! Amenities in the room included free filtered bottled water (in glass bottles to be eco-friendly), robes, slippers, and nice smelling bath products. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The check-in process is very easy and personalized. They are awaiting your arrival at the front desk and you are immediately shown to your room, no waiting. Again, I wish it had been warmer when we visited because the outdoor pool and hot tub area was very inviting with a fabulous view. The grounds and property in general were very nicely maintained. This was my first stay in Napa Valley and Yountville is a great town to make your home base. There are so many great restaurants within walking distance - so wonderful after a day of wine tasting when you don't want to have to drive anywhere. I didn't take advantage of any of the spa services or the hotel restaurant so can't comment on that, but check out the individual bathroom stalls located just outside the restaurant and near the bar area.

I'll get to this later and expose how crazy I really am. This place is ambitious! When we arrived we were instantly greeted by a couple pleasant door men wearing uniforms that were comprised of shorts and short sleeved shirts in a beige hue which went with the surrounding; these young men offered assistance and took us inside to a podium where we were checked in and then led to our room as if we were on a guided tour or being sold a unit. The complex is set up not unlike condo units, two stories each of metal and wood with modern art that pays tribute to the past (namely the henges of England and some Greekiness) Still in progress grape vines are growing in the front of the grounds and what I believe to be an herb garden is nestled along the eastern border. The underlying impression I absorbed was that the architects were not fond of curves. Continuing with this theme the room was very sharp both in construction and in aesthetics; it actually made the chamber have less of a flow but that's fine I didn't develop some weird right angle phobia or anything. Our room came equipped with a beautiful flat screen TV, a fire place, a media hub, a fridge containing some water, a king size bed, a couch and ottoman/coffee table and plenty of media about the hotel all in a chic pale. Off the bedroom/living area is the terrace that was quite sizeable while providing a duo of deck chairs a table and chair set up complete with an umbrella to keep off the mid-day to evening sun. The wash room was quite spacious with a tub for two, a stand up shower, a pair of vanities with washing basins and a lot of closet space. This is also where the in room massages take place. An iPod station is located here which connects to speakers in the massage/ wash area which is cool but all I could think about was how really cool it would have been if speakers were available in the bedroom and terrace. I know it sounds strange but this is one of the little things that would have put the Bardessono in the stratosphere for me but I'm also a huge music lover. Included in the technology front would be the automatic shades that come down when the room is empty which is reported to save heat; these are manually controllable from a master panel which switches on lights and fire place as well. The pool experience was a fair, there were many cabana hutches and parasol covered deck chairs for lounging and such. I found the water to be very pleasant though a pool attendant was in need to skim the tree debris from its surface (loudly noted by another guest). While the poolside attendant was friendly and accommodating they close down service at 6PM which is several hours before sunset when the pool closes for the night. The clientele here definitely had an elite vibe causing me to wonder who's life I was living, a topless beauty sauntered about while talking loudly on her phone, a couple next to my hutch talked about scripts and various creatures that could labeled as \"arm candy\" laid about basking in the golden Napa sun. Our breakfast room service was delivered hot and promptly within the quoted time. Was it the best RS? It was close to it in terms of quality but because of the buildings structure (two stories, no elevator) the server had to make two entrances to our room and two trips up the stairs with the trays. This is pretty inconvenient for everybody involved. Our check out was smooth and the valets were quick and friendly upon departure.

In short, the hotel delivers as advertised and does not disappoint. Their website tells you much of what you need to know - its a very contemporary, well run, beautifully maintained property that sits in the ideal locale of Yountville. We stayed in the \"basic\" room, which was enormous, filled with every gadget and amenity you can think of - plus it had a large private patio. The property is obviously very \"green\", but you don't sacrifice any beauty or luxuries for it. The service is a bit inexperienced, but very attentive and performs well. The roof top pool area is quiet and well designed with comfy louge chairs and plenty of cabanas. If you like elegant, eco-friendly and modern design, this is a stand out property. The other big plus is the location - Yountville, which in my view is the very best place to stay. Fabulous restaurants within stumbling distance and easy access to wineries off Hwy. 29 or the Silverado Trail. Also, being toward the southern end of the valley, there is also less traffic. My only knocks on Bardessono are as follows: Despite the depressed economy, the room rates were quite high - even for their more standard rooms, which are admittedly gorgeous. Still, the place was probably less than half full and they seem to be still charging rack rates. In the end, I'm not sure its worth the big dollars, but that is an individual value question. (One other hotel option to consider that maybe less expensive is Villagio, which is a 1/2 block away and is also quite beautiful and full service.) My other knock on the place, albeit a minor one, is the mandatory valet parking. It's a bit annoying and unnecessary. They have a large lot that one should be able to self park in. This isn't Manhattan - self parking should be an option.

Every hotel in Napa offers guests a complimentary bottle of wine. This one serves up a noisy, empty cooler, fanning away all night. They did bring by a plate of fruit and nuts, but only to interrupt us WHILE IN THE ROOM -- totally uncool, very unsubtle, go straight to jail do not pass GO. When we arrived, a flurry of FIVE staff started bustling about. But we only had a piece of luggage each, so what's the big deal guys? This insane gaggle of staff once spotted us emerging for the room and RAN TOWARDS us, in the perfect calm of an early spring evening. [--] RUNNING towards us. We should have turned around and ran away. The last straw was that the same thing happened when we checked out, only the rep took the BF's roller luggage, and returned 3 minutes later to take my shoulder strap bag. Ladies first? In all my travels around the world and back again in the hospitality industry, have I ever witnessed anyone so useless/ clueless. Are the staff trained to be this way? It's so PEACEFUL and private and understated at all the \"nice\" hotels; how can these guys get it so wrong?? What a shame, esp with what they are charging. Think Bardessono and what comes to my mind is -- must get the hell away from this place, can't wait to leave and experience Yountville! And oh, btw, a wonderful couple we met at Bouchon, let us know their concierge at Villagio got them a last minute table at French Laundry. The concierge at the B didn't even bother to try; she didn't even suggest ANY of the other 20 fabulous restaurants within a 10 minute walk, or 10 mile drive. Final oh btw -- we stayed mid-week and judging by the number of cars in the valet-only lot, we were one of three hotel guests. Still, the \"service\" for in-room dining could not send over cream and sugar for coffee, for whatever reason. Too busy perhaps? What we did like -- bacon extra crispy, beet salad with mozzarella, the cabanas at the 2/FL pool, proximity to Bouchon Bakery, Bouchon, Bistro Jeanty, Ad Hoc, Redd etc., hotel concept. The place is a disaster.

The service was exceptional from check in to check out! We rented bikes for one day which was complementary. We just went to the front desk where they had everything ready and they even customized the bikes for each of us. They also packed us water for the trip. The rooms are one of a kind as you get to see how green the hotel really is. The rooms are called spa rooms and you see why the minute you walk inside. The bathrooms are gorgeous and we were disappointed we didn't get to spend more time inside! They also had herb and fruit infused water waiting for us each night. We also ate at the restaurant and again had a great time. The food was excellent and the service was amazing. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, especially those looking for a unique experience.

The rooms are very modern and spacious but at the same time also somewhat stark and austere. The bed room and entrance area are entirely covered in concrete tiles, and the furnishing of the room is sparse and angular. In line with the Bardessono's commitment to the environment, the lighting inside the room is mainly fluorescent and LED, which produces a rather cold ambiance. The fire place is one of these modern gas fire places that consist of a single row of gas jets surrounded by some decorative glass pearls (the whole thing is behind a glass screen, so it doesn't even produce any significant heat). The bath room is very spacious with shower, jacuzzi, and two separate sinks/vanities. Both the shower and the jacuzzi have large floor-to-ceiling windows that provide you an unobstructed view to the outside. Unfortunately, there are two minor flaws with this design. First of all, there is not really much to see other than your private little garden area that is surrounded by a wooden fence. Second, the unobstructed view may work in both directions if your room is located near the roof-top patio: people on the patio can watch you taking your shower, and you better remember to let the blinds down, unless this kind of experience somehow turns you on. The hotel is in a very quiet area of Yountville (which, by itself, seems to be a very quiet place to begin with). However, we had some issues with noise sources in our own room. Instead of a mini bar, the rooms at the Bardessono are equipped with dual-temperature wine coolers that you can use to store the loot that you purchased at the local wineries in Napa Valley. The wine cooler is a handy feature for wine aficionados, but on the down-side it is the single most annoying noise-maker in the room. The wine cooler is integrated into the room furniture, and a small whining high-speed fan takes care of removing the excess heat. The fan is about as loud as a cheap desktop PC. Unplugging the cooler and the fan was about the first thing that I did after entering the room, but that might not be an option for those people who actually need to store some wine. The flat screen TV is equipped with some sort of add-on surround sound unit which makes some low-frequency humming noise even when the TV is off. This was not as bad as the wine cooler but bad enough to prevent us from falling asleep, so we unplugged the TV as well. Finally, speaking of annoying little noises, the fire place will make loud clanking sounds for about half an hour after you switch it off. Keep that in mind when you are planning to go to bed. The service at the Bardessono was pretty good without any major problems. The hotel offers free valet parking but unfortunately no self parking (essentially, you pay tips instead of parking fees). In the end, as always, whether or not you choose to stay at the Bardessono is a matter of personal preferences. If you enjoy an ascetic lifestyle and need a lot of space in your room to stretch out your yoga mat, then the Bardessono is a perfect choice. The same is true if you are environmentally conscious and prefer a hotel that shares those same ideas. However, if you want a cozy place with a warm atmosphere then there are probably other hotels in Napa Valley that would be better suited.", "Date": "May 9, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Las Vegas, NV", "Title": "\u201cPerfect place for a 40th birthday celebration\u201d", "Author": "JudyLasVegas", "ReviewID": "UR29269414", "Content": "We had been anticipating the opening of this fabulous green hotel since I first read about it from staying at a sister hotel over a year ago--and we were not disappointed.

The style of the rooms is clean and modern with every possible new technology to make your stay easy--buttons available for the auto shutters, auto fireplace, steam shower, etc. We did a massage in our rooms which all have special accomodations for in-room massages and was above our expectations.

We travelled with our 11 year-old in one of the 2 queen-bedded rooms.

It also had a flat-screen of its own, and night tables, both of which she used. The technology in the rooms is impressive, whether the geothermal-based HVAC, 2 stage toilets, or self-closing and opening shades to keep the heat out when your not around. While many like to \"push\" green initiatives for the sake of being different, this hotel showed just how well energy-saving can blend into the background and only be noticed if you look or ask. Grounds are equally impressive, whether walking the herb garden (we asked the chef who was picking herbs about the evenings menu) or admiring the numerous water sculptures, plantings and just the architecture itself. The staff was incredible. Very smooth and polished for such a new place, and not overly formal nor were they casual to the point of \"trying to be hip\". Location in Yountville is ideal, and we across the street to Bouchon bakery every morning, and had other enjoyable dinners at Ad Hoc and Hurleys, also within walking distance.
