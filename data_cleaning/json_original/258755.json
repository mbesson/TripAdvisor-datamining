The hotel was popular with tourists and the reception staff were very helpful with information to make trips easier. Breakfast was not included in our package and we could have had breakfast in the hotel for 18 euros each - a bit pricey. We did however find plenty of coffee shops nearby where we had a coffee and croissant for a few euros - a better option we found. Over the time we were in Barcelona, we found that most of the restaurants had good lunchtime offers - 2 courses and wine/beer or sangria for between 15 to 18 euros each - good value. We bought a two day pass on the tourist buses and used these as our normal method of transport. There was only one problem with getting back on the bus at Montjuic castle - we had to wait as a number of buses came but were all full! Barcelona continues to be very popular with tourists! We were leaving on the morning of the Barcelona marathon and the reception staff were very helpful in keeping us up to speed on the travel information and when the roads would be closed - we eventually left for the airport a bit earlier than necessary and this proved to be a wise move as later on getting out of the centre of Barcelona proved to be a bit of a problem to our fellow airline passengers.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "4.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Umea, Sweden", "Title": "\u201cGood, accessible hotel\u201d", "Author": "Zizu123", "ReviewID": "UR127242367", "Content": "This is a good hotel ideally located near the Barrio Gotico and within walking distance of most interesting sights.

Other reviews on TripAdvisor mentioned that it was quiet and the hotel\u2019s website also noted the soundproof rooms.

Our room on the 7th floor was spacious and very quiet. We especially appreciated the hand-held shower with very good water temperature and pressure, and the room where we were able to store our luggage before check-in.

We were a bit disappointed the pool was closed, as it was quite warm on the day we arrived, but we hadn\u2019t really expected that it would be open given the time of year. Our second stay was not as satisfactory as our first. We were given a room on the fourth floor at the rear of the hotel, but the window hinge was broken and, as a result, the room was not sound-proof. We mentioned this to the front desk and were assured it would be dealt with. There was an attempt to remedy the problem, but when we explained that the room was still very noisy, nothing further was done. On the plus side, I noticed the check-in card offered a free glass of cava between 9 and 10pm, so this did help us get to sleep. Overall I would recommend the HCC Montblanc as a good Barcelona home base or as a weigh-point for cruisers.", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "The Netherlands", "Title": "\u201cCity hotel - needs an upgrade\u201d", "Author": "jvdv", "ReviewID": "UR97272603", "Content": "An ok-ish 3-star hotel.

Greatest feature of this hotel was its location. About a 5 minute walk to Plaza Catalunya- the airport shuttle buses drop off and pick up from here, there is a central metro stop where many lines intersect and it is where you can find a very large location of the department store-El Corte Ingles. Just a tip you can take throughout Spain and not just in Barcelona is that you may want to find the nearest El Corte Ingles because it is here where you can find just about anything but most useful for us is El Corte\u2019 supermarcado (supermarket) where you can stock up essentials like bottle water and snacks or anything you might have forgotten to bring from home! The very busy and touristy Las Ramblas is about a 10 minute walk where we found it very easy to find a place to have a nice dinner. The room itself was pretty spacious-we had a double room with two double beds a desk and large closet. Note however that the in room safe is not included in your nightly rate and is rented at a rate of 5 Euros/night. The room also had a small mini fridge which we filled with our own water bottles and drinks from El Corte as the mini bar rates were pretty expensive. One thing I feel I should mention was the very ugly and quite gross stain we found under our desk on the wall-I didn\u2019t feel the need to photograph it as I didn\u2019t want people back home to think \u2018ick what kind of hotel did you stay at!\u2019 That did mar our stay in this hotel. I also felt bad for the front desk staff as there only ever seemed to be one employee there at one time and they were always busy. This also made it a somewhat longer check in time as there were quite a few people waiting to speak with the front desk. One evening we called down for more towels and ended up having to call twice.

It is a 3 star hotel (part of the HCC chain) and was clean, modern and comfortable. We booked a non-smoking room beforehand and were given a room on the first floor round the back of hotel. It overlooked a narrow street and we weren\u2019t really disturbed by noise. The hotel is carpeted, which meant that we weren\u2019t disturbed by noises from the corridor. We stayed on a bed and breakfast basis. Breakfast was served from 7-11 am. It was a bit basic \u2013 a cold buffet, plus an option of some cooked food it you requested it. We stayed from Friday to Tuesday and for some reason the breakfast seemed worse on Monday - the juice on this day was squash and there wasn\u2019t much choice of yoghurt. The bar area was a nice place to relax at the end of a day of sightseeing. There were plenty of comfortable seats and a computer with wi-fi access. Drinks were expensive (a coffee was 2.50 euros; a glass of rioja was 2.85 euros; a glass of San Miguel beer was 3.65 euros; a glass of cava 3.50 euros; a 250 ml bottle of water was 2.50 euros). We were offered a voucher for 2 free glasses of cava between 9 and 10 pm, but we were always out at dinner at that time, so were unable to use them. There was a pianist in the bar on most evenings, who was excellent. It made a nice change from the muzak that was played the rest of the time. There is a (very small) pool and sun terrace on the first floor, but at the end of March the pool had tarpaulin over it and it was too cold to sit on the terrace. The room was fairly small, but fine for a mini-break. It was very clean. The shower was powerful, but unfortunately had a shower curtain around it that stuck to me as I showered and couldn\u2019t stop the water running onto the bathroom floor. The bathroom also got very steamed up after a shower and the steam took ages to disappear. Toiletries were replaced every day: 2 shampoo sachets, 2 shower gel sachets, 2 small bars of soap, 1 shower cap, 1 shoe shine, 1 comb, 1 small pack tissues. There was a mini-bar in the room. I only used it for a bottle of water, but when I realised how much the water cost (2.75 euros for 330 ml) I drank the tap water for the rest of the holiday (it\u2019s safe to drink, but doesn\u2019t taste very nice). There were two single beds pushed together, with one, very flat pillow per bed. The hotel is near the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya, where the airport bus arrives and leaves from. It is a five minute walk from Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya to the hotel. The bus took about 30 minutes and a return ticket was 7 euros. Eating out Restaurants outside of the tourist area were hard to find. On our first night in Barcelona we walked for miles (up Via Laietana, down Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia to Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya) unable to find a decent restaurant, before ending up eating at Ginos (an Italian pizzeria) almost next to the hotel! The food was OK \u2013 they had an interesting take on the Catalan bread with tomato (a sauce was put on pizza dough). I ordered the pasta with mushrooms. The pasta was fresh, there was plenty of parmesan, but very few mushrooms. We also ate at another pizza restaurant, Pizza Marzano on La Rambla, which is very similar to Pizza Express. The food was good, but expensive for what it was (1 starter, 2 pizzas, 1 bottle of water, 1 bottle white wine came to 50 euros). There are a lot of Japanese restaurants in Barcelona and we found one recommended by the Time Out Guide to Barcelona \u2013 Matsuri on Pla\u00e7a Regomir in the heart of the Barri G\u00f2tic. I would happily recommend this restaurant. It was very quiet on a rainy Monday evening in late March. The waitress didn\u2019t speak English and we didn\u2019t understand the protocol of how to order Japanese food (even from a menu in English!). As a result we ordered too much food, but it was delicious and there was lots of choice for vegetarians. Another restaurant in the Barri G\u00f2tic that we went to on a rainy Saturday night (and we were just looking for somewhere to get out of the rain) was Ateneu on Pas de l\u2019Ensenyan\u00e7a. There was nothing vegetarian on the menu. The food was mediocre and very expensive. I felt that as tourists we had been ripped off here. Vegetarian food is almost impossible to find on most menus in the tourist areas. A few vegetarian options are included on tapas menus, depending on the restaurant. Tapa Tapa, which I think is a chain, had quite a bit of choice for vegetarians (eg vegetable tempura, a tomato and courgette layered dish, patatas bravas). Non-meat eaters who eat fish should be OK, but I found the best menus for vegetarians were in Italian or Asian restaurants, rather than Spanish ones. There are also specific vegetarian restaurants, but they tend to be cafeteria-type places. Some restaurants are closed on Sundays and/or Mondays, so if you want to go to a specific one check before you go. For lunch we tended to go for tapas.The worst tapas we had was at Bisbe Restaurant near the Cathedral (in the heart of the tourist district). The food was mediocre and expensive. The most authentic was at El Reloj on Via Laietana (near the hotel). It seemed to have locals eating there, which is always a good sign to me. We also had lunch at Pizza Marzano on La Rambla \u2013 they have a lunchtime special of starter, pizza, coffee and drink for 9.50 euros. We had tapas at Tapa Tapa on Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia (near La Pedrera) \u2013 there was a lot of choice on the menu, but the restaurant was very busy (it was a Sunday afternoon and we had to wait for a table). The dishes arrived separately and the waiter forgot to bring one of our dishes and had already cleared our plates before it arrived. We found a cafe away from the heart of the tourist area, near the Arc de Triomf \u2013 Cafe Napolean, on Ronda Sant Pere, where the coffee was nice, the toilets were clean and the prices were reasonable. Also the Farggi chain has coffee at reasonable prices (1.40 euros) Sightseeing Barcelona is an easy city to get around on foot and we walked a lot in our five days there! The metro is clean modern and reliable. We used it to get from Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya to Lesseps (the nearest metro station to Park G\u00fcell). On our first day we walked around the city just to get a feel for it. We started from the Cathedral where we had lunch, walked down La Rambla, with a stop off at the Pla\u00e7a Reial (with its fountain and Gaud\u00ed-designed lamp-posts, and headed to Port Vell (there are restaurants, shops, an IMAX cinema and an aquarium here - all seem to be aimed at tourists. Here was the only place where we saw people selling fake designer handbags and sunglasses in the city). We then walked past the fish restaurants in the Barceloneta area. From here we walked to the Sagrada Familia (via Passeig Picasso, Passeig Sant Joan, Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes and Avda Diagonal). The Sagrada Familia is a stunning building, but the scaffolding around it meant getting good photos was difficult. It looked good in the early evening light (we were lucky to visit it on our only sunny day!). We didn\u2019t go inside \u2013 too many tour groups put us off. From here we retraced our steps (turning off Gran Via onto C/Paul Claris, which leads onto Via Laietana) back to the hotel. Day two was our art gallery day. We visited the Picasso Museum in the morning (be prepared to queue). Entrance cost 9 euros. This museum doesn\u2019t contain his most famous works, but has a good collection of his early work and also the Las Meninas series. In the afternoon we visited the Dal\u00ed collection in Museo Real Circulo Artistico (near the Cathedral). Entrance was 9 euros, but didn\u2019t seem worth it. It seemed a bit of a random collection (the main Dal\u00ed collection is in the museum in Figueres (a 2-hour train journey away)). Day three was our Gaud\u00ed day. After starting at the Palau de la Musica Catalana (nothing to do with Gaud\u00ed!), to take some photos of the stunning exterior (although it looks better at night when it is lit up, so we returned there after dark), we spent the morning at the Park G\u00fcell. (If you take the metro, there is a 20-minute walk to the park, part of it uphill.) It was packed with tourists and impossible to get a photo of the famous tiled benches! Entrance to the park was free. Although the park is a must-see attraction, we felt a little disappointed by it. After leaving the park we took the metro to Diagonal, the nearest metro to La Pedrera. We queued 30 minutes to get in, but it was worth the wait. Entrance cost 9.50 euros and this gave us access to an apartment recreated in early 20th-century style, an exhibition about Gaud\u00ed and the famous roof terrace with its almost surreal chimneys and ventilation shafts. Just down the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia is another famous Gaud\u00ed building \u2013 the Casa Batll\u00f3 (the building with the balconies that look like masks). We didn\u2019t go inside this one \u2013 just photographed it from the outside. Unfortunately there was an advertising hoarding on the building next door showing a woman in a bikini, which we didn\u2019t want in our photos! The Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia was one of my favourite streets to wander down, as it is full of beautiful architecture and lamp-posts. Day four was a Monday and most of the museums and art galleries were closed, so we spent the morning looking round the two main places of worship \u2013 Santa Maria del Mar and the Cathedral. Santa Maria del Mar is a charming church, simply decorated, but with stunning stained-glass windows. We didn\u2019t get to see much of the Cathedral, as it closed at 12.45 (it reopened at 5pm) and we turned up at 12.40! On our last day we visited the Museu d\u2019Hist\u00f2ria de Barcelona (entrance 6 euros). The majority of the museum is taken up with Roman remains (a large part is about the fish and wine industries), but not as complete as in other places we\u2019ve visited (we\u2019ve been to Ephesus). There was also a section covering the history of mediaeval Barcelona. Some of the information is in English, but many of the exhibits only have the information in Spanish and Catalan. The most interesting thing for us was a film showing the history of Barcelona up to the modern day. It didn\u2019t go into enough detail for me, but did give an overview of the history of the city. There is also a small chapel near the exit included in the entrance fee. All in all it was a bit disappointing. Shopping Barcelona is a great place to shop, but it didn\u2019t seem any cheaper than back in the UK. The main street for \u2018high street\u2019 type shops (Zara, Mango, H&M) is Portal de l\u2019Angel (just off the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya). On Portal de l\u2019Angel and on Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya are branches of the main Spanish department store, El Corte Ingl\u00e9s and looking round this store can fill a rainy afternoon! For designer shopping (or just window shopping) walk down the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia (we discovered a lot of shops between C/Arag\u00f3 and Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya).", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood location and value for money\u201d", "Author": "melherb", "ReviewID": "UR24400424", "Content": "This review is for our stay in April 2008.

I went to reception to ask for a room change and the previously quite friendly receptionist bluntly told me \"but it is a no smoking room\"!

I was told that all they could give me was another room in separate part of the hotel away from my children's room (I got the impression that she was hoping that would put me off!) but my kids are 18 and 13 so they don't mind being away from our room and I took the option offered but it was done with a bit of huffing and puffing. On the whole the rooms seemed clean, reasonably spacious but were rather bland - you could been staying anywhere in the world in a mid range chain hotel. One room had noisy air con the other was OK. I booked it because it had a pool, but be warned the picture flatters to decieve, it is tiny and it feels very hemmed in by the surrounding buildings, some which were not vey attractive - I can't imagine it gets much sunlight down there. It is also gated off quite early in the evening because the restaurant uses the surrounding area for diners. In the end we didn't get a chance to use it. I was quite surprised to see a security guard by the front door most of the time, I wasn't sure if it made me feel safer regarding the hotel or that I should be more worried when out and about in the City.

There are lots of good and nice tourist shops nearby for souveniers and presents to take home and some good clothes shops too. The street artists were very entertaining at night time too, the group of boys who do a street/break dancing show across from the metro are very good and i really enjoyed watching them. A good place to go is the Hard Rock cafe in barcelona where you can also visit the rock shop for tee shirts and souveniers, it is very busy and seems to be the place to hang out.

Hotel is less than5 minute walk from drop off point but not in the middle of the hustle bustle of the major shopping area. Hotel is located on a busy street.

There was an error in rooms assignment for our group but they quickly, pleasantly made necessary adjustment - everyone was happy.

A/C turned off for winter season. We just opened the window for ventilation (room on 6th floor so security not an issue). Even with windoe open, street noise not bothersome.

We booked a double room, through the HCC website for approximately \u20ac114/night. We had a pleasant stay at a hotel in a great location for seeing the sites of Barcelona. I would recommend it to anyone as a reasonable value in the area. The reception clerks were friendly and helpful, spoke full English and explained the terms of the hotel well. We were given a room on the front of the hotel, #212. However, as other reviewers have noted, the hotel did not look at any of our comments from when we booked the room online (we had requested \u201ca quiet, non-smoking room\u201d), as we were given a smoking room on the main street. Though we did have a room facing the Via Laietana, where traffic noise could be heard throughout the day, this noise was lessened at night and being from an urban environment back in the US, we didn\u2019t find it to be bothersome, though I could see how others might. The windows are double-paned and did a significant amount to quiet the noise, as it was quite loud when we opened them to get some fresh air. I would suggest if your comments are of particular importance to you that you should reiterate them upon check-in. We didn\u2019t feel strongly enough about it to be bothered to ask for another room. The room itself was spacious, pleasant, and simple, though somewhat dated in its stylings. There was a reasonable sized closet and the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was large and well appointed, with a nice strong shower and plenty of counter space. The room, the bathroom and the rest of the hotel were all spotlessly clean. The free internet ADSL in the room worked well and was a good amenity. Cable television had only one English speaking channel, CNN, which was fine. As it was mid-November and only in the upper 60s, we never went looking for the hotel pool. The HCC MontBlanc is in an excellent location, close to many restaurants, the Metro (Urquinaona station is right across the street and Catalunya station is a few blocks away) and several tourist sites (La Ramblas is less than 5 minutes walk, the Cathedral is less than 2). We took the Aerobus from the airport to Placa de Catalunya, as recommended by others, and found it to be a quick and inexpensive way to get within just a few blocks of the hotel (roundtrip fare was only \u20ac6.80/person). We had good meals at both La Rosa Negra (Mexican) on Via Laietana and Les Quinze Nits (French/Catalunyan) in Placa Reial. We opted against including breakfast in our booking, as at \u20ac14/person, it seemed a bit expensive. There are plenty of small restaurants and shops selling breakfast sandwiches and the like for much less in the area. In short, the HCC MontBlanc is a neat, simple, clean hotel and I would recommend this 3 star to anyone looking for affordable accommodations in a great location.

My wife and I didn't have breakfast in the hotel as we found a lovely place where the sight-seeing buses stop, just opposite the En Courte Englais Store (excuse the spelling) called \"Beer & Coffee\", great for breakfast and inexpensive tapas. We stayed for a week. Our room was fairly large, air conditioned and totally spotless. We ate out every night. So many restaurants in Barcelona, but our favourite one was \"El Gran Caf\u00e8\" on C. Aviny\u00f3, near Pla\u00e7a St Jaume. We would thoroughly recommend the Montblanc Hotel to anyone. We will definately be using this hotel again the next time we return - that's for sure!!!", "Date": "July 7, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Largs, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cvery suprised by its low rating on tripadvisor\u201d", "Author": "rjbxll", "ReviewID": "UR5290983", "Content": "This was a marvelous hotel.

It is close (but not too close) to Las Rambla - about 5mins walk. The centre of Barcelona is within walking distance, as is the port, zoo area etc. Do note however that a lot of the attractions in Barcelona are quite dispersed. They do however have a good metro system and for the tourist, open top bus routes through the city - you can buy your ticket and hop on and off at every stop or stay on for the 2hr duration. I recommend the orange open tops which depart just outside Hard Rock cafe. They are much less crowded and no queues unlike red bus system. Hotel Mont Blanc is very clean, rooms are large for a 3star hotel. Air conditioning is excellent and certainly needed at the height of summer. Mini-bar is provided and tv with the usual news channels as standard. Bathrooms are modern and spacious. A major advantage the hotel has is a sun terrace and pool - very rare in the city centre. The pool is more of a plunge pool than anything. The only minor hotel complaint would be the reception staff - surly would not be in it! However if you let this ruin your trip then you're obviously usuing any excuse to find faults. The hotel bar and restaurant are always empty, only ever a few people in the bar later on at night as they return from the entertainment in the surrounding areas. Overall the hotel was clean, quiet and excellent value for money. Barcelona is nice but not one of Europe's many gems.

The hotel is a good standard, but the piano bar is pricey and has service without a smile. Just use it as a base. Swimming pool is closed out of season. Agree with the earlier comment about needing longer for the tourist buses: you can get a 2 day ticket for not much more than a single, and the two routes are completely different. If going out of season watch out for things like the cable car up in the hills being unavailable. The weather in december was mild but not warm.

We had breakfast 1 out of the 3 days and wasn't very impressed with the food or the price. I think it was around \u20ac16.50 per person so you are probably better off going to one of the many cafes near by. They have a lovely piano bar but drinks can get a bit expensive. My friend ordered a jack daniels and coke and it was around \u20ac12!!! We were suprised how warm it was considering it was November but we didn't even need a jacket in the evening. Barcelona is a beautiful city and I can't wait to visit again and I would definately stay at the Montblanc again. There is so much to see. The red and blue tourist buses are great but ensure you allocate a day for each bus. Also I would recommend heading down to the harbour and beach as there are some lovely bars and restuarants.
