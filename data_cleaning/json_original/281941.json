In fact it has to be one of the easier ones (go to San Marco Square via the Water Bus Line #1, walk to the North Side of the square and find the Quadry Restaurant, walk through the passage way next to it, go over the bridge and take the first right (at the end of the bridge) and walk next to the canal - once you get to a dead end - you're there).

To the left of the basillica is a small concert hall you will see flyers everywhere for vivaldis four seasons which is lovely but even better was the second evening of songs from different operas which was absolutley magical and one of the highlights. Make sure you go to the top of the campinile the veiws are spectacular. I'd also reccomend going to burrano rather than murano all you will see on murano is the same glass wear your sick of looking at in venice by day four!! whereas burrano is so pretty as everyhouse is painted a different colour well worth a day trip There are some great resturants up by the opera house behind san marco expesive but beautiful food however If you go down the side of the clock tower and take the first right you should emmidiatley come to an italian resturant that does the best spagetti and meat balls in the whole of venice. And if your feeling extravagant order a glass of champange or two at the bar inside florians and drink it there while your served with canopies and that will be cheaper than ordering tea or coffee and sitting outside!! enjoy venice", "Date": "January 26, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "4", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "1", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "West Orange New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cExcellent location-Beware of Bellman\u201d", "Author": "Jerseynurs", "ReviewID": "UR12479753", "Content": "Had a three stay @ the San Marco Suite located behind San Marco Square-- The suite consisted of Master bedroom, Living-dinning room-kitchenete and second bedroom- mini balcony @ Master bedroom- bathroom - with antique decorations all very well kept and clean- rooms have side-canal view- The only problem we encoutered was a bellman-concierge who is very rude and has no social skills- he tossed the room key onto my hand and walked away upon our arrival -Did not even gave us direction to get to our Suite- If you don't mind this type of incident the hotel is centrally located near best attractions in Venice-", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmond, Oklahoma", "Title": "\u201cTorre Dell Orologio Suites were great!\u201d", "Author": "OklahomaTracy", "ReviewID": "UR12101691", "Content": "San Marco Palace - The Torre Dell Orologio - has had very mixed reviews- We are used to staying in 4 & 5 star rating hotels- the European ratings and American ratings are a bit different.

This being our first trip to Italy and our honeymoon- I was hoping that everything would be as we expected! It was very delightful and we would stay again. The front entrance of the Torre was somewhat difficult to find- so try to have good directions. Arriving after dark could be a challenge! We were 23 meters from the clock tower of San Marco- it was a fabulous location. The hotel was quiet and the breakfast dining area- was a maze to get to- but very nice with granolas, fruit, danishes, meat and cheese tray, juices, excellent coffee, hot teas, and other goodies.

We loved it so much we tried to extend our stay there while there, but couldn't get later flights out. Our family of 4 (7y/o & 10y/o) stayed here for 4 nights even though we had read some negative reviews. Our experience was very positive. The room was spacious, with two bedrooms and a living/kitchen - all spotlessly clean and modern. Both bedrooms looked out over a small canal (one was actually built over the canal) where it was fascinating to watch gondola owners put away their boats for the night. The staff were friendly, helpful and spoke good English. The included breakfast was fine, but don't expect an English or America menu. There was no crockery or cutlery, so we purchased some from a local supermarket, and used the microwave to heat water for tea & coffee! Location: It was not difficult to locate the hotel, but to help, here are some directions - from the Grand Canal walk through Piazza San Marco to mid way along the northern section where you'll find an alley going north by shop number 119. Set above head height on the wall of the alley are two signs - a white one - SOTOPORTEGO DEI DAI and yellow one - PER RIALTO FERROVIA - P. LE ROMA. Walk along that alley a short distance and over the bridge crossing the Rio del Procurate canal. Immediately after you get over the bridge turn right and you walk along side the canal for a few metres to the hotel entrance. The only difficult bit is carrying cases up and down the approximately eight steps each side of the small bridge, but at least they are the only steps and it is not far to walk from the San Marco Vaporetti stop. Other advice: The three day Vaporetti pass was by far the most economical and effective way to get around. We took a water taxi back to the airport at the end which was expensive (90E) but great fun and well worth it for a grand and easy exit from Venice. Food everywhere was excellent - we really enjoyed Vino Vino (located on the corner of Calle della Vestr and Rio della Veste) - good food, simple pasta the kids liked and very reasonably priced; but the options for great food and wine and icecreams for the kids were endless. The Lido was dirty last time we were there, but fine this time and a highlight for the kids was hiring a 4 wheeled 4 person bike in Gran Viale Santa Maria Elisabetta, to travel in to the beach. We took a Gondola ride during the day and another one in the evening - the latter was much better, cooler and you avoid the very crowded day time Gondola traffic. Expect to pay up to 100E but avoid the evening surcharge by starting before 7pm. We paid 80E, while the Americans before us on the same boat paid 100E!

They also have a cooktop and refrigerator, although the cooktop is not really functional since they don't include pots or pans or plates. The refrigerator came in handy for drinks and leftovers. The breakfast is quite good and is included in rate - good assortment of meats and cheeses, cereals, fruits, breads, etc. The location can't be beat - just off of Saint Mark's square - but it is still quiet and is located at the end of a tiny canal. It is a little tricky to find the hotel the first time so be sure to get the map off of their internet site. It is important to know that the tiny canal it is located on is too small for water taxis to enter. So, water taxis can only bring you to the main water taxi park (near the vaporetto stop) at St. Mark's square. You then have to walk across the square (all the way across) and through one of the walkways, up and down steps (to go over the small canal) and then a few more steps to the hotel. This isn't a big deal if you are walking only, but if you are carrying luggage you need to be prepared for this, as we weren't. I would not recommend that an elderly person try to do this and roll luggage unless they are fit. Also, there is one small elevator that is often slow.

Well, after reading ALOT of reviews on the San Marco Palace, I was a little nervous to book this but the location sounded perfect and they had a family suite. We had the directions to the hotel from the water stop that were posted from another reviewer and they were right on... but we still got a little lost but quickly righted ourselves and found it. It was in a perfect location right behind St. Marks Square. The hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful (no rude people on our visit). We had the family suite on the top floor and it was really nice. A HUGE balcony with a view of the bell tower and tops of roofs. Not the most spectacular but really a bonus to have the balcony. The room was neat and efficient and the bathroom was clean and the water was fine. The beds were a little hard and small, but when you are tired from running around Venice all day, it's all good! The room is a little worn but really very acceptable. We didn't have breakfast there so I can't comment. There are too many great places to eat at so we just went out and found somewhere to grab a quick bite. All in all, it was a very pleasant stay. Just a comment on the Murano tour that came with our room...There was no push for the tour from the hotel staff, just a comment when we checked in. When we came back into the hotel at night, we decided to take the free tour (private water taxi & tour) to Murano. The hotel manager on duty that night suggested that we go over after lunch, around 1:30 the next day. We did that and it was fantastic! We had our own private tour because there were no other people in the glass factory at that time. In any event we watched them blow glass and then we walked around the showroom (no obligation or push to buy). The men blowing the glass were so talented. It was facinating to watch.

The room configuration was one bedroom with a double bed, one with two twins, and then a sofa bed in the living room. The beds were VERY firm and not very comfortable.

When we decided to try to make his job easier, (there were FIVE of us) and carry up our own bags... he stopped, didn't say a word, held out the room key, dropped it in my wife's hand and turned and walked away without a word.
