Rooms are reasonably sized considering \"room sizes\" in/around Paris. The buffet style breakfast provides flexibility if you're attending an event. I was also quite surprised I didn't have to use my European French accent to have the staff understand me ... quite a plus in Paris... otherwise I would simply speak English while being Quebec French. You are 10-15 mins (wlaking) away from many attractions (Jardin du Luxembourg) and 30 mins tops from other main attractions such as Notre-Dame ... Five min walk to the famous restaurant Les Deux Magots... which did not impress me after eating and drinking wine South of France, but nothetheless real nice.... There is a bar right across the hotel for a younger local crowd which is quite an experience... if you don't mind proximity :) A real good choice indeed ..

We were a little battered, because the staff at the hotel in Madrid was very unhelpful. Ooh la la. The staff at Hotel Le Littre are professionals. The desk personnel put their heads together to help us plan day trips. They had a good supply of Metro tickets, schedules for attractions, etc., and they made reservations for us with aplomb. We witnessed the employees being very patient with nervous older guests who did not speak French and were strident about not being able to use the Metro, etc. I so enjoyed being greeted by everyone I encountered with a vigorous, cheerful, \"Bonjour, Madame!\" I really enjoyed the wake up calls. Sexy David woke me up with a mellifluous \"Bonjour, Madame, This is your wake up call. Have a wonderful day.\" Did this old lady a world of good. No robo calls at Hotel Le Littre. The rooms are very comfortable with good mattresses, ample closet space, and satellite television, which made my husband happy. The baths have a nice shower and tub with good water pressure and an adjustable shower head. The breakfast has a very wide selection of breads, hams, cheeses, fruits, pastries, and juices, as well as scrambled eggs. The coffee and tea are excellent. The housekeeper is diligent at checking the rooms, and the maids are very good. The hotel is on a quiet street around the corner from restaurants, shopping, the Metro, and bus stops. It is easy to get to all the attractions. You cannot go wrong if you stay at Hotel Le Littre. We were in the hands of hotel management pros.

When it was first suggested that we try Le Littre my first reaction was: who wants to be all the way out there. In the middle of nowhere! Do you know how long it would take to get back to Saint Germain or the Musee D\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Orsay? Well, it is not in the middle of no- where; it is in the midst of a vibrant part of Paris that used to be home to Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, Satre, Chagall, Picasso and Man Ray. Nestled on a small street steps from teeming Blvd. Montparnasse and the Montparnasse train station; surrounded by many great bistros and brasseries, and convenient to stops of the 4 Paris-Metro lines this is a Parisian keeper. It is about a 20 minute walk from the heart of Saint Germain and half that from the Luxembourg Gardens The rooms for Paris are big; it was converted after WW II to house U.S. Air force staff. The staff is friendly, the service good, the breakfast included and plentiful, but it is the terraces and view of the Eiffel tower on the top two floor of the hotel that make this place so very special. We stayed in 801, which is access by a special key to the elevator, making the eighth floor feel safe and secluded. The suite had big rooms, fireplaces and a big terrace that could be accessed from both the living room and the bed room. The furnishings were would one would expect from a hotel in Paris of this class but sitting on the terrace, any time of day or night gazing at the Eiffel Tower, beautiful in the day and exquisite with its new lighting at night made this hotel and this suite one of special memories. Totally there are about 8 rooms with views and terraces. After 3 nights we moved to the elegant Georges V with its superb appointments and service, but frankly despite all the fabulous food, d\u00c3\u00a9cor and service we missed the Le Littre and its view and bustling surroundings.

The hotel proved to be the ideal base, it's well connected by Metro and the tourist busses and has a number of charming shops very nearby. The local boulangerie, bars and bistros meant that we didn't need to move far from the hotel at all to get everything we needed, night or day. All in all, very good value and we will most certainly be back.

We were not disappointed. The assistance we received prior to arrival from Thomas Chalet, the Rooms Division Manager, was invaluable. He always responded immediately to our email requests and went the extra mile in terms of service. On arrival, Thomas had pre-checked us in as far as he was able, and allowed us to complete and return the registration form in our own time. This meant we were checking in to our rooms within a couple of minutes of arrival. This typically Parisian hotel is superbly located: 2 mins walk from Montparnasse RER/Metro and all the bars and many restaurants/bistros that line the Boulevard du Montparnasse and St Germain de Pres. 10 mins walk from the charming bohemian Latin Quarter, the Sorbonne and Notre Dame Cathedral. Bus stops at the top of the road which will take you to all the sights in Paris. Because the hotel is situated at the bottom end of a very quiet one way street, there was no noise at all during the evening and night. You would not think that you were in the middle of a city bustling with activity 24/7. We reserved Superior Rooms with external balconies ( well worth the extra money) which overlooked the rooftops of Paris, with a bird's eye view of the Eiffel Tower - stunning when lit up with thousands of twinkling lights when dusk falls. The rooms were spacious and nicely decorated and the bathroom large and well maintained and equipped with toiletries. We ordered continental breakfast in the room, which arrived within 10 minutes, and was served on our balcony in the glorious sunshine - what a treat! We also experienced breakfast in the restaurant where they served everything you could want : bacon sausage eggs etc ; variety of breads; yoghurt; fresh fruit; deli meats and cheeses, juices and choice of hot drinks. The waiters ( Mahommed and his colleagues) were constantly cracking jokes with customers and were eager to serve you. The bar man was also very polite and accommodating to our party. The staff on Reception were so helpful and responded to every enquiry with enthusiasm and a smile - Michel, Thomas and Opel stood out for us.

We loved that the window's french doors opened for fresh air. Because we were facing a courtyard, there was very little street noise. Every maginable service was nearby. A tiny grocery was 3 doors away where we purchased fruit, bottled water, snacks, wine & beer. There were at least 3 bakeries, a bank & ATM, a post office, local buses, the tourist hop-on hop-off bus, the metro, several bars and restaurants all within 2-3 blocks. We ate at a different restaurant every night. We travelled all over Paris and had no trouble getting back to the hotel in a reasonable time & low cost. Even taxis shared between 3 or more people are very reasonable. Shopping options were too numerous to mention. On our first night , the Solstice Music Festival was on and you could hear the combined voices of singing groups and the sound of strolling musicians well into the night. It was quite magical. The singing ended when rain started to fall in earnest . I imagine that they all just stolled into whatever restaurant they happened to be near and continued...there are certainly dozens of bars & bistros nearby to choose from. The hotel front desk staff were friendly and helpful; most spoke reasonably good English. We received excellent advise about what to see and how best to get there. The hotel provides a helpful events calendar for the week which is produced in several language. Bus/metro tickets were available for purchase at the desk and we were also able to book tours, taxi's and airport transfers. The maids kept everything spotless in the rooms & common areas of hotel. If you want extra towels, glasses etc, it helps to know a little French. When booking the triple room, we were required to purchase a very expensive buffet breakfast option. At first I was a little annoyed but it turned out to be ideal for us. We were out all day site-seeing and really needed a hearty breakfast. Also, two of us are diabetic & having a balanced meal (not too high in refined carbs which seems to be the French norm) is essential. When I looked at the cost of the room (divided by 3) and added the cost of breakfast, I realized that I still paying a very reasonable price for a well located, lovely accommodation in Paris. The breakfast room is on the lower level and serves both hot & cold options. The food choices were basic. eg Eggs, sausage, potatoes, cereal, fruit juice, fruit salad, whole fruit, yogurt, dried fruit & nuts, great local cheeses, sliced meats, baggette, brioche, whole grain bread ( a rarity in Paris), pastries...it really was a more than adequate selection. Plus, we were able to take a piece of fruit or a little sandwich for mid-morning (a diabetic necessity). What I loved was the large individual pots of hot, strong coffee and seperate pots of hot milk (which they would refill). I felt well fed and well-caffeinated to face the day. If you are not a big breakfast eater and have a room that doesn't require you to pay for breakfast, there are numerous bakeries withiin a couple of blocks, a Starbucks, even a McDonalds....so you can definitely eat cheaper at breakfast time. If I go back, I will still choose the hotel's breakfast which it had lots of healthy food options not available at the bakeries.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "walrus on holiday", "Title": "\u201cexcellent hotel central location\u201d", "Author": "gooseeggs Posted by an OctopusTravel traveler", "ReviewID": "UR116348945", "Content": "excellent customer service all staff extremely helpful rooms to a good standard in good location just a few minutes walk to bus/rail/metro connections lots of cafes, restaurants,creperieres, shops nearby excellent breakfast selection enough to keep you going all day", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lincolnshire, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cNice, but would try another hotel next time\u201d", "Author": "dhjj", "ReviewID": "UR116252591", "Content": "Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised that they gave us an upgrade to a very large room which even had a walk-in closet.

Make sure you walk around the area because there are 2 street nearby that seem devoted to restaurants that serve crepes. we indulged one evening with dinner and dessert crepes and it was a gastronomical highlight. One tip - if the front desk folks tell you that breakfast is included be careful, especially if you did not book a room and breakfast ahead of time. It's included all right - but you pay extra (a princely sum of 40 euros a day). And if they insist on telling you it is included then make sure to ask if its included in the price you booked at.

The bed was good (not too hard, not too soft) and the street at night very quiet so we had no problem sleeping whatsoever. The best part though was the large balcony a table and chairs and a breathtaking view of the Eiffel Tower. This is where we ended each day with a bottle of wine, watching the tower light up and sparkle. Breakfast was buffet style with lots of choices, French (baguette, croissants, chocolatines) or American (eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, cereals) style. It was included with our package but I believe it is 20 Euros otherwise. Generally, the staff were very courteous and very helpful. The hotel is situated on a quiet street but close (5 minute walk) to a major metro station (Montparnasse-Bienvenue) which means you can go anywhere in Paris in a cinch. There are also plenty of restaurants, stores (Galeries Lafayette), marketplaces (Au Bon March\u00c3\u00a9 is nearby if you want to do some \u00e2\u20ac\u0153\u00c3\u00a9picerie\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Paris style), etc. Another plus is that it is a 10-15 minute walk from the Jardins du Luxembourg, a great place to stop and snack on a baguette sandwich for lunch while you watch the children play with sailboats in the basin.

It wasn't awful, but it wasn't exactly fabulous. We picked this hotel because it was the cheapest in the area, so we can't really complain too much. The beds weren't very comfortable, and the pillows were flat.. But honestly, after a long day of walking around Paris, I couldn't care less. WATCH OUT FOR THE BREAKFAST BUFFET. It appears complimentary, because you literally just walk up and sit down. Someone eventually casually walks by and asks for your room number, and the next thing you know, 20EUROS per guest gets added to your bill. There's no notice, no warning, no sign.. The breakfast WAS good, though. But just be AWARE that you're paying for it. Considering breakfast AKA petit dejeuner is about 8EUROS for a coffee, orange juice and a measly croissant at nearby bistros, I suppose paying 20EUROS for all you can eat is worth it. They had a spread with bacon, eggs, fruit, cereal, cheeses, meats.. All good things. The location was GREAT. Montparnasse metro can be confusing, so just make sure you exit the right way. DEFINITELY get a Navigo pass. SO useful. The Littre bakery next door is AMAZING. We showed up a few minutes before closing to pick up crossaints, and when we got back to the hotel we noticed that they tossed in TONS of extra goodies, including chocolatines. Mmmm! Also the Brioche Doree right at the corner has these killer Mango Lemon Granitas.. I consumed many. What else, what else.. The internet situation was definitely NOT ideal. There is free Wi-Fi in the lobby (or as they say, le wiffy), which is decent. You can sit on the sofa or chairs and plan your next day in Paris. The internet available to the rooms is 20EUROS per day and you have to give them 50EUROS for a cable.. Don't bother trying to mooch Wi-Fi from surrounding networks, I tried the entire trip. If you didn't bring a laptop, don't even bother. The computers available to guests are ancient, they are DELLs, and they are ridiculously slow. Also, Europeans have a different keyboard layout, which makes it difficult to use. The TV is small, but you didn't (hopefully) come to Paris to watch TV, so who cares? There's only a handful of french channels, which I found surprising, and one english channel which was CNN. Overall, it's a decent hotel. The staff was friendly, but sometimes a little snooty. They always answered our questions politely, though. Like I said, we chose it because it was the cheapest.

The Metro was an added bonus for the 1-2 drizzling days we experienced, or for trips farther out. Misc Items unrelated to hotel.... Although the Eiffel tower level 3 (top) was closed for repairs, this attraction is amazing. It is also a stones throw from all other attractions. I highly suggest you take a good pair of walking shoes for the Louvre Museum. We spent 8hrs at a brisk pace and saw roughly 90% of the museum. BTW, skip the 6euro headsets unless you have loads of patience to operate the device and walk at a snails pace. Lastly, I highly recommend the D-Day Normandy trips to all those history buff's.

Finally, after researching for two hundred or so hotels, succeeded in shortlisting about 8-10 hotels with THE VIEW. For this short trip, I had narrowed down to two hotels, the 5 star Hotel Lancaster (off Champs Elysees) and the 4 star Hotel Littre. Having just stayed at a 60 sq meters suite at the Hotel Lancaster, I was looking forward to a \"Deluxe room (40 sq meter) on the 8th floor with Eiffel views\" - as promised by Juliana of reception/reservation. However, upon arrival at the Hotel at 2pm, I was told by a lady that they had made a mistake - that rooms on the 8th floor were all suites, and we would be allocated a smaller room on the 7th floor instead. First impression - could this be a \"bait and switch\", that we sometimes read about on hotel reviews? Upon entering room 709, my heart sank immediately, the room itself was probably only about 20 sq meters and there was absolutely no place for sitting or resting, other from the bed, of course. It was also hard to find space to open up our two small cabin bags for unpacking and packing the next day ... It was as they have said ' its hard to even swing a cat ' in that room. Fortunately, the saving grace of the room was, that it did come with a rather big terrace with a long table and two chairs, with views of the famed Eiffel Tower and Invalides. But this was as promised in my letter of confirmation from the reservation - so no surprises. After having seen the posted rate of the room as '370 euros' behind the door, and I being charged only 224 euros, I seriously doubt that we were being taken for a ride - it was still reasonably good value considering this is Paris. The good thing about this room was that it was located at the corner of the Hotel, and being on the second highest floor and the hotel being located on a quiet side street, it was blissfully quiet for a good nights sleep - important for our 13 hours flight back home the next day. Also, the furntitures, wardrode (lots of closet space!) and even bathroom looked very very new and well done! Surprisingly, the bath tub was even bigger and nicer than the one at Hotel Lancaster! Had a nice soak in this brand new tub with good shower strength! The other thing that surprises me was its TV had more than 24 channels, with about 6-7 English ones! Now, thats not an easy find in Paris, I think. There was a safe and powerful hairdryer in the room though. We paid the extra 20 euros per person for the buffet breakfast the next morning, and were not disappointed as well. Pastries, breads and hams was of rather good quality, however, the same cannot be said of its orange juice (not the freshly squeezed kind) and coffee (rather watered down)! Ambiance was good but not superb, with only one poor serving staff working all the time. . . The other staff from the doorman, porter, reception were all very kind and helpful - really have to thank them for the directions to Le Bon Marche (an easy 10 minutes walk). There is also a mini-mart around the corner of the hotel for drinks and titbits (in the same block). Turn left or turn right out of the hotel, and you would find many cafes, bistros and restaurants. There is even a Chinese restaurant on the same block! And now the small glitches of the hotel - in March, I believe the air-conditioning was not turned on, so we had to open the windows while we sleep, otherwise we wold suffer from bad air-circulation and sneeze alot! No extra mirrors in the room, so wasting of time in the morning with one using the toilet and the other waiting ... No free mineral water, no hair conditioner. Overall, for the price I have paid and having such a great view of the French icons, I think this is a fairly good hotel if not for the initial shock of the smaller room. For romantics at heart, go for it and ask for the right room (in writing, of course!).

We did not experience the breakfast - simply because nether of us eats that much in the morning and it's expensive at 20 euros per person.

Our first room was not satisfactory - on the sixth floor, and while it was reasonably spacious and the bathroom was good it was disappointing for the price and we slept very poorly because of a loud and disturbing mechanical noise. As soon as we brought this to the attention of the staff they moved us to a much more acceptable room - also spacious, with very good facilites. The second room, unlike the first, was much more charming. The staff were attentive and considerate; the housekeeping service was very good; and the location was excellent. The Le Littre is close to the metro, restaurants, the open air market on Saturday, which should not be missed, and all of Paris is accessible from this hotel - we chose lots of walking, but equally, the Metro and bus services are great. One criticism - and it's not particularly serious is that the hotel's internet service can be spotty - so be aware. Having said that they were very helpful, to the ability they could be, in making sure we got access when we could. We also aren't sure if they take the postal service seriously - we paid them to send some cards and a letter for us - two weeks later they haven't arrived.

I paid around $200/night, which is far below the rack rate, and I would hesitate to pay more, even though that is a good rate for Paris.

Way too much milk and a bit undercooked. The front desk was quite helpful in recommending local restaurants and transit to the major attractions. However, they did lack some knowledge when I inquired on where to buy the RER/Versailles combo pass that I read about in Rick Steve's travel book. The rooms were quite clean and odourless even though I was in a smoking room. However, sometimes I could smell smoke coming in through some of the vents. The only other complaint I had is the shower. It was very very slow to drain. I believe another reviewer mentioned this as well. The hotel is definitely not handicap/people with limited mobility friendly but then again neither is Paris. Overall I was quite pleased with the hotel. Being a first timer to Paris, I didn't realize the alarm clock is built into the TV.

Why we chose this location? We wanted a centralized location so we could walk to the sites and after looking at a ton of hotels, this one looked the best and one where we could get a decent deal with through our travel agent. Hotel is down a very quaint street and we always felt safe walking around no matter what time of day it was. Check-in was very painless and the people behind the front desk were ALWAYS nice and very helpful!! We apparently got upgraded for some reason, but who was I to argue. We took the lift to our room, 510. I believe it was 510 it was right off of the elevator to the left. I was worried being so close to the elevator, but this hotel was always so quiet. Very decent size to our room and the bathroom was also very decent. Both the room and bathroom were clean. The view from our room was a courtyard \u00e2\u20ac\u201c it just overlooked the other windows of the other rooms of the hotel. We figured that the ceiling of the dining area was what we saw when we looked down on the ground. It wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t the most scenic of views, but we were out of the room during most of the daylight hours so it never truly bothered us. Safe & fridge worked. The thermostat in our room didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work though. We never thought to call, not exactly sure why, we just didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. We opened our window to air out the room when we were in the room and even slept with the window opened a bit as it would have gotten too warm. The outside temperature never really got that warm so I guess with the chill in the air and the warm air flowing, it was just fine. Breakfast was served each morning and it was part of our package. It was, OK. I more or less stuck to cereal or croissants with some jelly or cheese. The prepared eggs were a bit too runny for me so I opted for cheese to sustain me. There were also bread selections, yogurt, breakfast meats (sausage & bacon), juices, coffee, etc. The staff always greeted you with a smile and were quick to bring you coffee. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if I would pay again for the breakfast, but it was a good clutch to have to grab something quick on your way out the door. Location \u00e2\u20ac\u201c for us it was a very decent location. It was about \u00c2\u00bd hour walk in one direction for the Louvre and Notre Dame and then about 30-40 minutes in the other direction for the Eiffel Tower. Plenty of restaurants right up the block and up and down the street. Thankfully the hotel was down a small side street as the main street right nearby could have been an issue with the noise. But like I said, this hotel was always very quiet, we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have one issue. The hotel bar was always empty and the front desk clerk would come in to serve you if you wanted something from the bar. The pictures that were hung up were of what the hotel was like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153back in the day\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, that was so cool. I cannot comment on the metro since we chose to walk everywhere. We did have one small issue - we left the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Do Not Disturb\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sign on our door. It was our last full day so my husband and I figured that we wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t bother with them making our bed, changing our towels, etc. When we returned later on that day we walked in to find that our room was in fact cleaned. I mentioned it to the girl at the desk and she said that she was doing housekeeping that day and called our room and since there was no answer she thought we left the sign on the door in error and came in to clean. Thankfully we didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t leave out anything of value or of importance, but to me if I put the do not disturb sign up I would want them to stay out of my room. Live and learn and maybe tell the front desk to let the staff know to not clean the room. In the end it wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t a big deal, she apologized, and we moved on. On our last day we inquired about a taxi for our trip to the airport. They suggested a car service they work with so we opted for that thinking it was more reliable than some random taxi. We left plenty of time to get us to the airport and thank goodness since our car was about \u00c2\u00bd hour late. Overall, this hotel was really great.

He booked the hotel as part of a package with Eurostar and I have to say I was very pleased! The hotel was incredibly easy to find, just one Metro ride from Gare du Nord which was good as we had our luggage with us, and when we surfaced in Montparnasse it only took a minute to get our bearings and work out where the hotel was. It was down the pretty quiet street Rue Littre which had a large post office on the corner and a couple of little eateries on the way down to the hotel. I think there was also a school at the end of the road although I can't be sure. The reception to the hotel is gorgeous and we were given an extremely warm welcome by the reception staff who checked us in quickly and also offered us a map of the city along with some brochures. We were on the 6th floor so were very pleased for a lift. Our room was lovely, a decent size, clean and very comfortable. When we unpacked we discovered a problem with the safe in that it didn't work properly but after speaking to reception we headed out for the afternoon and by the time we came back it was either fixed or replaced! While we were there my boyfriend was taken unwell so we ended up spending an entire afternoon in the hotel. I ordered some room service in the evening as I was starving but my boyfriend was not well enough to go out - the food wasn't too bad, I had a curry and he attempted some soup with little success. The bread was lovely although I was so disappointed that we weren't provided with milk for our tea and coffee. It seems in France you have to ask for milk if you want it! We also had problems with our television in that the 3 English speaking channels all froze and never seemed to come back - obviously I wasn't too bothered on the days where we were doing something but when we had to spend the afternoon in the hotel I would have liked to have something other than my book (which I finished that afternoon!).

I booked a deal through an hotel packager based in London (via the Internet) where I paid for three nights and received the fourth night free. I knew that I would get the most basic room. I had read other reviews that said that the hotel offered an upgrade if one was available. Most likely since I was getting a free night anyway, they were less willing to do that. Once I saw the basic room, I called the front desk right away to see if an upgrade was available. They offered me one for 50 additional euros a night, which I gladly paid when I saw the difference in rooms. The standard room was on the fifth floor and faced a bleak courtyard. My upgraded room was on the third floor. (I could walk upstairs to it and didn't have to use the small elevator.) The room had an entryway with a walk-in closet containing a safe to one side and on the opposite side of the entryway was a bathroom with just the toilet. Then you walk through French doors into the main living area which had a couch that folded into a bed, cocktail table, end tables, desk, bed, TV and two windows facing the street. The marble bathroom, (sink, tub) window, complete with bathrobes, was off of that. I thought this was quite a deal, because my four-for-three deal came with the 20 euro breakfast. The breakfast at the hotel is big -- about everything you could want. If you stay here, please greet the breakfast wait staff with a \"bon jour.\" They appreciate just a simple acknowledgement. I saw people come down to the breakfast room, ignore the staff and just start filling up their plates. The location of the hotel is great. The bus just at the corner will take you right to the Louvre's front door. St. Sulpice Church is only a couple of bus stops away. Really, if you get a transportation pass while you are in Paris you can go anywhere. I bought mine right away and never had to worry about coming up with money when I took a subway or a bus. This hotel is also right on a couple of major subways. It's very easy to get around. I liked the bus best. (TIP: If you attend a concert at the Musee d' Orsay, you can exit right into the museum without waiting in line or paying an extra fee.) The front desk people were very, very friendly. As mentioned, greetings are important. If you don't want to learn any French, just learn how to say \"Do you speak English?\" The French appreciate your acknowledgement that you are in a country where English is not the first language. That courtesy will get you far and make people feel good at the same time. The shops up and down the main street by the hotel have good prices, and Bon Marche is pretty close by, though I found it very expensive. If you want to stock up on things for your room (like wine and chocolate) turn right and then right again when you exit the hotel's front door and you will find a small grocery store down a couple of blocks. I would recommend this hotel highly for being friendly, clean, pleasant, safe (I was there by myself), a good value and in a great location. Probably the only thing that I didn't like was the hand-held shower device (which is pretty standard in Europe) and the hair dryer. The latter looks and acts like an attachment to a cannister vacuum cleaner! Vive le difference! When I come back to Paris, I will stay in the Marais district next time. It has so much character, you think you are on a movie set. However, Hotel Littre is in Montparnasse, the stomping grounds of the Lost Generation, and it was fun to explore this area of Paris.

I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not making a joke or inviting others to joke, but simply wishing to pass along an experience so others won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be surprised. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if this condition was limited to room 605 or simply one of those Parisian oddities. What I discovered was a small vent on the floor next to the bathtub, which if I kept covered, seemed to eliminate the problem. Since the problem was inconsistent, manageable and never existed in the room itself, I never complained; really didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to repack in order to change rooms as I was tired after an already 10 day stay on the Right Bank. Nonetheless, a silly little experience. I did complain about all three English language stations being out, Friday 2/15 until 2/19 since I missed my daily political/news fix. I accepted the explanation that this matter rested with the provider, not the hotel. Internet available in Lobby for 5 Euro a day but they seem to be a little generous about this as it only appeared on my bill 2/6 days. Overall, I would certainly consider returning; however, if you haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been to Paris and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to get about on the Metro, I would suggest something more central to the main sites on the Right Bank.

A three minute walk past all kinds of shops and patisseries and breakfast grabbage places to one of the best Metro stations in the city... several lines available, and you should be able to get most places in the city with No or One Transfer between Metro Lines. Be Warned... the station is a maze and you could easily spend twenty minutes trekking to your line or trying to find the best exit to the street. Everything awesome about the 6th (your neighbourhood, as all hoods are numbered in an outward spiral from the city centre) is within walking distance of this hotel. Included Breakfast was substantial and perfect for fuelling up for a long day walking the city. Staff were helpful, if a little Euro-distant, making good recommendations for restaurants, handling airport limo confirmations, even sending my wife to the right place for a billion-dollar haircut (COST a million, LOOKED like a billion). The bartender in the hotel lounge (closed at midnight) was friendly and equally helpful. Maid service was thorough and conscientious. IF YOU DO NOT SPEAK ANY FRENCH make sure you begin your conversations with the staff (and all Parisians, really) by politely asking if they speak English and if they would mind speaking with you in this language. I've seen reviews decrying the staff for rudeness, but by our observations while we were there, it is highly possible that people brought some cold or abrupt treatment on themselves by assuming that everyone they met was ready or able to speak in (North) American English. France is a courtesy culture and if you don't have any courtesy to give out, you ought not to be surprised if you don't receive any back. Internet access is available for a small charge in the lobby. Be prepared to use a french keyboard that is ALMOST but just frustratingly not quite the same as a QWERTY keyboard. A perfect, perfectly romantic place to make your homebase as you visit Paris. We will stay here again without a second thought.", "Date": "January 8, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Business service (e.g., internet access)": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Durham England", "Title": "\u201cWorth every penny (euro)\u201d", "Author": "Hothellman", "ReviewID": "UR11688191", "Content": "Before we arrived I was concerned about the quality because I have been in some terrible hotels in Paris despite good reviews.
