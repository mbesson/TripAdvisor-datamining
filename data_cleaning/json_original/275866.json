This condo hotel resort is located right on the beach with all services that can be desired on a Caribbean vacation.

That has to say something about the popularity of this condo hotel. I would rate it a very high quality 3-star or low 4 star. It is very clean and service is excellent as it is owned by a very prominent resort company called Sunset Group. The property is well maintained and managed. The lobby and guest rooms have recently undergone $5 mil in improvements and refurbishments. The timeshare members and RCI guests will be delighted to see the new furniture and up-date rooms. If high-end meals are important look elsewhere as you will find the presentation and service very good but only average in flavor and quality at Fishermens. You get what you pay for no matter where you travel. Fishermens offers an economical meal plan as compared to other resorts that charge as much as $125 usd per person per day for food and booze. I go to Mexico for the beach and sun (R&R). The food and booze is second on my list of measuring value.

The hotel is built on the beach, the beach beds are amazing, we always managed to get an umbrella and the double beds have a roof cover so there is plenty of shelter. The beach is cleaned every morning and ours was definately the cleanest beach compared to other hotels. There are 2 bars, one in the lobby and one at the pool, the beer and spirits were good and the cocktails were fantastic, try the Riviera Maya! We ate in the buffet restaurant a couple of times at night but tended to go to the Italian which is on the beach, the food here was cooked to order and was better than the buffet, Carlos the waiter in her was great, ask him to make a Mayan coffee, it's quite spectacular. Breakfast was fine, buffet style so it does get a bit repetitive but the freshly cooked omlettes were great and if you ask Geronimo he will get the chef to cook you a Mexican breakfast which was really nice. Our room was excellent, we had a sea view, a jacuzzi on the balcony, cleaned very well daily and if you want the coffee replacing in your room just ask reception, it was there before we got back to our room. We were asked once if we wanted to visit the new RCI resort and when we said no we were just wanting a relaxing holiday we were never asked again. The resort is a 15 minute walk to Fifth Avenue either on the beach or the streets, which are more sheltered. There is a restaurant just before you get to the shopping centre if you walk on the road called Xulam which was fantastic, we stopped there a few times for cocktails and once for a meal. We did a few trips, Coba and Mayan Village which was good but once we had been to Chichen Itza we would recommend this rather than doing both. Xcaret was ok, but couldn't get round it all in the time we had available and wished we hadn't booked the night show as that wasn't so good.

I've been there when it rains and the top floors leak... I had a studio and it was perfect... a nice big bed, table and 4 chairs, 2 stove tops a couch and chairs in the balcony. I love my coffee in the balcony... some have a jacuzzi in the balcony but sometimes it doesn't work. The staff is very nice... the head bartender needs to smile even if he doesn't get the big tips, LOL... I noticed how nice he was at those that gave him $10 or $20s but not too friendly to the rest of us. You are not there for the liquor or the food... except, I have to say that I enjoyed the dinners... which were about $40 including 2 glasses of wine. The \"all inclusive\" is not worth it because you will not drink that much... not good liquor. The a-la-carte prices were good... Buffet was $16 and I had plenty of fruit and eggs any way I wanted them and a latte! They have a welcome buffet on Saturdays and of course, try to get you to a time share presentation but it was not pushed. On Sundays, they have a Fiesta with Mariachis... very small but it's nice. By Thursday you know your neighbors and it's like being at home... on Friday, you are sad you are leaving the next day.

The activities director keeps you busy if you want... and he is great with kids... always playing some group game.

I love being in a neighborhood and only a few minutes away from shops and restaurants... if you walk along the beach, you will get there faster and it's cooler. You are also close to the Conzumel ferry, which makes it very convenient. The hotel has a free shuttle to town at 9:30am and 11:30am... they also have free wifi in the lobby area. The beach is what wins all my points... it's nice and when it doesn't rain, it's clear and like bath water... you see people in the water at 7am! Sunset is wonderful... the sky has so many colors... just lovely! I had a full body massage outside and it was so relaxing... Vicki is great.

We had to pay $70.00 something per day per person for breakfast and either lunch or dinner. Breakfast buffet was ok, but sometimes the fruit was too old, came out day after day. Was not appealing when looking old. Staff prepared fresh omelets, that was the best. I think we only had one or two lunches, odd menu that never changed. Choice of like 4 things, no mexican food. Now to dinner. Dinner is sit down, menu style. While the food was very good, it generally took 2 hours to complete. Not an exaggeration! There is some disconnect here between kitchen and wait staff. It would be 30 min or more between courses. Way too slow!!! Also traveling with vegitarians and never a choice on menu for them but I will say the staff tried really hard to arrange something.

My wife does like it though because it is a little secluded and quiet. The beach this time is much better than it was in 2008, back when they had sandbags to prevent further erosion of the beach). Now, Mexico put so much sand back into the beach that it is much, much wider and they removed the barriers between the different resorts. So now, you can walk all the way down to the port to Cozumel (yes, there is actually a beach now in front of the hotel/resorts by the port!) or all the way the other side to Riu or Sandos. We did not opt for the all inclusive given we think 1) it's not of any value when you're paying $55 or so per day but only have 2 meals - breakfast and dinner and 2) there is nothing much else to be had with the all-inclusive. The food is so-so but this 2nd time around, we ate in town for authentic mexican food and for much cheaper too (recommend la mission a block off 5th ave which is another locaiton from the Cozumel branch). There is a pool but small. There is a small gym and a spa but usually for members only. The steam room wasn't working this time around though. There is also a jacuzzi (cold and hot) just outside the gym as part of the spa. Where I am displeased with Sunset though is the inconsistency of information. We were moving to Tres Rios after our 1 week stay in Sunset Fishermen and though they can provide us a shuttle ride to the Tres Rios (sister resort and a much, MUCH more expensive one). 3 people we spoke with said no but we met another couple doing the same move to Tres Rios and they said 1 of the concierge arranged transporation for them. I'm pretty miffed by that since it's a $20 cab ride 1-way to Tres Rios. If it wasn't for my SO not feeling well, I would've taken the offer to share the free ride with the other couple, who were members also with another sister resort Sunset Royal. Wi-fi is only in the lobby, which sucks. But at least that is more consistent and on than Tres Rios (who's wifi is all over but very spotty and always disconnects/resets). There are not too many kids but there are families that come visit. It's mainly a lot of older folks (late 40s-50's) and families that show up. We usually just walk to town (15 min leisure walk) and there is not much traffic in Playacar. If you're looking for a quiet/secluded resort, this is probably it. It's kinda old school w/o LCD tv's. Some cable channels in American. You have to get used to a 1/2 glass cover for the shower. It is a no-frills type resort but the great news is they actually have snorkling gear to use, unlike it's more expensive sister Tres Rios that had ZERO snorkling gear (even just fins) if you wanted to snorkle out.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Macon, Georgia", "Title": "\u201cNice Friendly atomosphere\u201d", "Author": "jasonlcms", "ReviewID": "UR69589095", "Content": "We arrived and brought tropical storm Alex with us.

The lack of hot water combined with next to no water pressure and a plugged drain also made the spa on the balcony impossible to use as well. Another issue was the hot tub in the swimming area. It had a sign that clearly stated no children allowed. Yet many 3-4 year olds played in the hot tub alone, while their parents read books in their lounge chairs. When this was pointed out to the staff, they said they would enforce the rules. They never did.The children were never asked to leave an were back in the tub each of the following days. I did not use it because it was impossible to relax with the kids splashing, yelling and I was also concerned about how much pee was in that tub! Our king size bed was actually two beds put together. The sheets were too short and did not cover the entire mattress. I asked for proper fitting sheets, but they were never provided.

We rented the only 4 bedroom unit in the resort from a rental company called Ocean Summit Travel. We were two families; my family of 2 adults and 3 kids (9, 13, 15) and my in-law's family of 2 adults and 2 kids (13, 15). Overall, this resort worked great for us, thanks in great part to the facilities and staff at Fisherman's as well as the other owners/guests at the resort. As some background, we had traveled with the same group during spring break for the previous two years, once in Mazatlan and once in Puerto Vallarta. Everyone agreed that, while we really enjoyed those vacations, this was the best. Our unit (#334) was on the third floor (no elevator) and was on two levels, with two master suites (with king size beds) upstairs on the sea side of the unit so you could open your window at night and hear the roar of the waves. The main level had two other bedrooms but not on the sea side of the unit. The kitchen was great; big fridge, dishwasher, microwave, stove/oven and a 5 gallon water dispenser, which the maid service replace each time they cleaned our room. It had a flat screen tv in the living room (also tvs in one master an one guest suite). One of the owners told us that this unit recently sold for $600k. It was very nice. Much of what made this vacation great was due to the resort. The resort is small by comparison to previous resorts we've stayed at and, in many ways, is probably why we enjoyed it so much. The resort offers a small restaurant (which we only ate lunch at a couple of times), a bar, a smaller pool, large hot tub, smaller beach, concierge desk and an activities desk that offers daily activities (water volleyball, bike tours, salsa dancing, etc) free boogie boards and bikes. The small size of the resort allowed us to participate in much of the activities. The However the staff really made the difference. We all got a kick out of the one man entertainment dynamo by the name of Sergio. Sergio is a young guy who leads seemingly all the activities such as water volleyball, aerobics, yoga, salsa dancing, and bartending class. He was so nice to all the kids, even playing cards with them for hours. He even served as a lifeguard when some got caught in a riptide during a windy day and was too exhausted to swim back in. The rest of the staff was very friendly and helpful. The resort is about a 15 minute walk to 5th Ave in Playacar. We found that our routine was to go for a morning walk through the Mayan ruins and to the main road where the all-inclusive hotels are on, go the pool/beach during the day, get a taxi ride to a restaurant somewhere ($5-7 per taxi). After dinner, we'd explore 5th Ave and then walk home, working off our large meals in the process. We made use of the Spa services on site; having a massage outside while the waves crashed on shore was very relaxing. The bikes were ok; some were in bad shape and not comfortable to ride - they could use to upgrade these bikes. On past vacations it was rare if we got to know any of the other guests at the hotel we were staying; at Fisherman's there were so many friendly owners/guests. Many of them were older/retired who had bought at Fisherman's when it was built 15 or so years ago. They all knew Playa well and loved to share their favorite restaurant or place to visit in Playa. If I had to list some cons to the resort I'd have to mention the beach, which was not very good while we were there, apparently because of the direction the wind had been blowing for the last couple of weeks. The sand bags in the water detract slightly to the beautiful Caribbean Sea. The pool is not large by any means but my kids didn't complain once about it.

The salesman whom I refused was rude, turning my declination of buying a timeshare into a personal attack. The concierge was loud and brassy and outright lied when it came to prices of tours.

Buy a good guide book and book a hotel, eat out, do the tours on your own (you'll save a bunch of cash.) Another tip: don't take their $40 shuttle to and from the airport.

Despite pre trip misgivings, I am pleased to report that we had a great time! I feel sorry for the RCI exchangers. They have to buy the all inclusive plan. The resort is small and therefor has one restaurant and a limited menu. Knowing this, the resort gives its members a choice of buying the all inclusive plan on a weekly, or daily basis, or we even have the option of not purchasing it at all. (PERK!) We Sunset members get the chance to utilize the awesome variety of qualities, prices and tastes of foods offered in nearby Playa Del Carmen. We thought of the resort as a home base and therefor we thoroughly enjoyed it. There is so much to do: Xcaret, Cozumel, Chichen Itza,Coba, Tulum, Xel Ha, Cancun, the cenotes, clubs, shopping, jungle tours, fishing, scuba diving, para sailing, sky diving, snorkeling... the activities go on and on! When we would come home in the evening, we had our beautiful, large, marle floored, well decorated, well air conditioned, 2 bedroom/3 bath suite, with indoor jacuzzi, and a stocked kitchen ( Thanks to our excursion to Walmart.). The beds prepped. The maids do an excellent job. After a nice shower, using those big fresh towels and slipping into the provided robes, we grabbed cold drinks and went out on one of the three balconies to gaze at the evening sky. The rooms are big and well decorated. The employees are wonderful. The location is outstanding, (How often can you have Mayan ruins right across the street from your suite?) The ocean and hotel views are beautiful. The drinks were as good as you can get. After the trip I was not only relieved at what we had bought the timeshare, but felt the pride of ownership. My kids had a grand time. We shall go again and once more it will be our home base. For us, the all inclusive mega resorts seem like al inclusive traps.

The first one is that in order to get out of the hotel you need a car or if you like to walk in the heat for 10-20 minutes, that's the other way to get to town. To get a taxi is normally easy but sometimes you have to be persistent with the staff because they can forget you. I was in Playa to get married and on my wedding day, I asked for a van for a certain time and they forgot about it. Until they saw me in my wedding gown waiting at the lobby running late, they started to do something. The second thing, (and probably this happens at all the resorts, so be careful!) is that they are very keen to get you buy a timeshare. If you don't mind spending some time with people selling something, this situation won't affect you. Remember to keep your hand band/bracelet all the time. We took our bands off for the wedding and next morning we couldn't eat anything because of the band, even though we had paid for the week.

There was a small, but comfortable living room area with a dining room table and a kitchen bar. This area had a patio facing the ocean with two chairs and a table. There was no dishwasher, however, there was no need since the maid washed the dishes each day. We noticed that there was no coffee maker and advised the front desk and it was deliverd by the time we returned to the room. There was a half bath in this area, as well.

The food was good, not excellent, and the women did get somewhat tired of it; however, you would anywhere you went. The men in our group had no complaints and were happy. The beach was lovely and there was plenty of room to swim away from the sandbags. We felt there was no reason to walk to the beachclub. Pablo was a delight at the lobby bar.

After reading about it online and seeing really nice pics of beautifully redone rooms we had pretty high hopes of a nice vacation. We were supposed to have a 2 bedroom/ 2 bath condo.I was travelling w/ my 16 yr old son and 14 year-old daughter. Upon arrival we were shown to a very old, outdated, cramped condo w/ no view. In all the websites I had seen on the internet none looked like this. We asked if there was any way we could get one of the redone rooms and they told us all of those are studio 1 bedrooms. We ended up in an old condo that did have a nice view.Then since we traded in w/ a timeshare co. we were forced to buy the \"all-inclusive\" everyday. This is really not an all-inclusive. They charge $12.00 extra if you want lobster for dinner. It includes the breakfast buffet everday which mainly consists of bread, bread and more bread. Then you can choose to use coupons they give you for lunch or dinner in the 1 restaurant they have that has a menu that never changes. Food is very mediocre for the price of $61.00 a day per person! We had alot of coupons left over because my two teens hated the food. We had to go into Playa Del Carmen for them to find food they liked. ($5 by cab each way). Don't buy the so called \"all-inclusive\" if you don't have to.The other thing you should know is the pics on the internet of the nice wide beach? Forget it. After the last hurricane their beach is only a few yards wide and has slippery ugly sandbags everywhere and workers trying to build up the beach. This is not their fault, but if you enjoy walking up and down a beautiful beach on your vacation go to Cancun.The pool is tiny by Mexico resort standards. No activities. The pool is only 5 ft deep. The hot tub that is supposed to be adult only was filled w/ small children splashing you w/ their flippers. Not really relaxing.My two teens were very bored and sometimes would not even come downstairs because of the beach situation and tiny pool.If you have teens save your sanity and money and go to a large fun resort like Occidental or Iberostar. Bright spots? The employees (waiters/bartenders/maids) were all very nice and try to do the best they can with what they have to work with. The spa is very nice with a great work out room and they give a really good massage. One last note - beware of the timeshare people. They have complaints from people being swindled all over the internet. Just say no and go about your day. Don't be swayed by the \"deals\" they try to give you.

I will discuss the following with some conversational style to give the review a personal, honest opinion of the resort, unbiased by all means possible. First, allow me introduce myself. I am a Citadel Cadet and I am 20 years old. I have been travelling to Playa Del Carmen to stay at Sunset Fishermen's Village with my family for our annual Christmas vacation. This vacation is the one necessity that I refuse to take out of my life and every year, this vacation is my chance to settle into one of the most relaxing, tranquil environments of the Yucatan Peninsula. I am thankful to admit that Sunset Fishermen's Village is the right place to travel in pursuit of the utmost serenity, selfless servitude from the faculty, and footsteps away from the adventurous nightlife on \"5th Avenue.\" I have two brothers; each separated by 2 years apart, and my mother and father with the delightful addition of my grandmother partake in this journey together. We all agree that Sunset Fishermen is the best choice for a great escape from the stressors of the life back at home and the place to have null responsibilities at least for a one week. As such upon arrival, our luggage is carried in for us while we are casually greeted to a welcome response with cocktails, food, and immediate attention to hurry the start of a wonderful vacation. Some small talk with the concierge, frond desk, and we are off to our rooms where each room is equipped with ocean front bay windows, full kitchen, and outside Jacuzzi baths. There are delicate carvings in the walls to include the master bedrooms which aid to comfort the slight constant moving of the ocean to serenade each night to sleep. Out of the room, is the centerpiece of the resort property; the pool, surrounded by 2 different bar and restaurant areas, and a panoramic view of the beach. During my attendance at the Citadel, I have a close affiliation with the beach and the water as much of the physical training is done in the harbor and some at the beach to simulate the intense flavor of Basic Underwater Demolition drills with weights and team work. Also, I am a certified diver trained and assessed off the South Carolina coast line where visibility is limited to about a 10 ft. radius from the naked eye while diving in the \u201cpluff-mud\u201d infused water. It is, therefore, increasingly pleasurable to explore the depths of the crystal clear ocean water, extraordinary colorful reef environments, and the incessant underwater ecosystem that\u2019s niche is on top of the purest white tropical sand. If there is one piece of advice I could give towards finding activity during the day, consider taking a snorkel/dive excursion. You will be very happy you did. As you lay under the sun, intermittently cooling off in the pool or the ocean, the selfless service of the faculty will kindly provide beverages and towels upon request. You are prompted to buy the \"all-inclusive\" package during the small talk when you arrive which provides you with an all day \u201copen bar\u201d life style, and 2 meals a day at whatever time you'd like to eat. Some have reviewed that it would be nice to change or alter the circumstances of the all-inclusive, but in my honest opinion, the Sunset group have done the work for you, and provided you with the motivation to go into town and eat from the finest local recipe's amid the authentic culture of Playa. My recommendation to encourage one place that is the most phenomenal restaurant experience, in my opinion, you should tell the taxi-cab to drive to \"Alux\" (\"All - looj\") or the \"cave bar.\" This place is a fantastic bar and restaurant which takes place in the one of the most interesting wonders of the world...a cave! Eating underground in a cave, while the food has mixed reviews (I was impressed with the food), the atmosphere alone will solidly leave you with one of the best restaurant experiences one has never thought of. As for a 20 year old, wondering around downtown Playa on 5th avenue, I found myself to be comfortable anywhere I went. However, it takes a little bit of confidence to have a good time in the clubs, because meeting people isn't so easy; hence the idea that I only speak English and no Spanish whatsoever. For the most part, the locals behind the bar can generally understand English while the \u201cmorena\u201d sitting with the cranberry vodka doesn\u2019t. But this is what makes it fun, trying to speak Spanish after good number of \"sol\" beers or enough rum and then learning how to salsa with the pros! Another plus towards the nightlife perspective in Playa, is the beach clubs. Many of the restaurants have taken advantage of the beach setting and so do the clubs...it makes it interesting trying to dance in the sand, it gets tiring a little faster than normal. Further into the stay at Sunset Fishermen's village, there is one, and merely one, set back that will interrupt your total relaxations; the timeshare meetings and the persistent persuasion to upgrade. Please, when pre-briefing may sound nice as they will tell you it only takes \"90 minutes of your time,\" try more like 4 hours! If you wish to see the future plans for the expansion of Sunset Properties and the newly comprise of \"Tres Rios,\" you can easily observe the macro glass displays and the pictures on your own time without the annoyance to upgrade and spend more money. Sometimes it works to politely say \"no thank you\" to the meeting request, and other times it doesn't because they are very persistent and have even offered bribes towards attending the meeting. Each year, I am caught in this meeting, killing my unremitting buzz and wondering what my opportunity costs were for the time I could have been laying in the sun. So, do yourself a favor and try to \"opt out\" of the meeting. In conclusion, I would rank Sunset Fishermen's Village as the Yucatan's best get-away vacation for anyone looking for a peaceful atmosphere of no responsibilities and less obliged to lift a finger for self servitude. My family, prior to staying at Sunset Fishermen's Village, would stay at Sunset Lagoon, in Cancun. Unfortunately, I cannot admit that one will ever receive a serene moment in Cancun; In my opinion, Cancun is a non-stop traffic jammed party. Sunset Fishermen's Village has accomplished to reverse that non-stop party feeling you might get while playing downtown by giving the vacation-goers a tranquil place to rest your head. From the gratitude of the selfless service from the staff, daily clean and sanitary rooms, the composure and location of the resort from the beach or downtown, Playa Del Carmen's Sunset Fishermen's Village is the perfect get-away vacation.", "Date": "June 9, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New York, NY", "Title": "\u201cGreat resort!\u201d", "Author": "ineedavacationbad", "ReviewID": "UR16194453", "Content": "We booked our stay through an RCI exchange. We got the 2-bedroom suite with 2 balconies and ocean views. The room was fantastic. We traveled with our 18-month old son, so it was nice to have an extra bedroom for him. The resort was great. It was a small, intimate resort and you didn't have to go far for anything (e.g., pool, beach, spa, restaurants), which was nice because we were forever forgetting something up in our room and had to run up several times a day. The pools were small, but nice. Our son pretty much got the kiddie pool to himself since there were no other children there during our stay. He absolutely loved it! The only drawback to this resort was the mealplan. With the RCI exchange, we were required to do the mealplan. It was expensive ($61/person/day) for breakfast and your choice of lunch or dinner. The food was not good, not terrible, but not good. For that amount of money, we would rather go out for our meals and would have gotten much better food. There also wasn't much variety when it came to food options. The breakfast they served was the same buffet spread everyday, which got tiring. We ate at the Italian restaurant one night, and that was pretty bad too. I'm not sure what the normal rates are at the hotel, but if you just book directly with them, you don't have to participate in the mealplan. Overall, this was a nice resort and we would definitely recommend it. If we do go back, we would opt out of the meal plan if possible. The resort is located about 5-minutes by car from the main 5th avenue strip of Playa del Carmen. We went there everyday either for lunch or dinner. There are a lot of shops and restaurants and just a nice place to walk around since there is no car traffic along the 20-block stretch. Tulum, a small beach town about an hour south of Playa del Carmen was worth the trip. White sandy beaches and you can rent lounge chairs by the beach and have food and drinks served. I would definitely recommend renting a car, especially if traveling with children, to get around whenever you wanted.

I walked into town 4 mornings with my dive equipment and it took me less than 20 minutes. I used Scuba Libre www.subalibre.com.mx, a very nice outfitter who had 3 days of diving (2 tanks per day) for the reefs off PDC for $170.

Daily room service is provided in a truly professional manner. We participated in the all-inclusive and were very pleased. The buffet, breakfast, lunch, or dinner, provides a menu that will appeal to any taste with food cooked and presented better than in most upscale restaurants.

Another couple and we booked a 2-bedroom suite through RCI and we gave it thumbs up with just a couple of minor exceptions which I'll share in a minute. First of all, the weather happened to be absoLUTEly perfect, with no sweaters needed at night, but no one panting for AC either. For the entire week, we ate every single meal outside. What a treat. Our 3rd floor suite was perfect for two couples...both bedrooms were upstairs (4th floor!), private and well-appointed with their own balconies. The livingroom, full kitchen and 3rd full bath were downstairs, also with a full balcony. The only noticeably well-worn furnishing was the sleep/sofa there. The entire staff could not have been friendlier, more welcoming...from the front desk to the maids, they were cheerful and helpful and the waitstaff's #1 goal was to be sure you had everything you needed. \"No worry; enjoy your vacation.\" The only drawbacks were: Upon checking in, we had a long wait while we were passed from one rep to another, almost like they didn't know what to do with us...but minimal timeshare pitch that night and NONE at all the rest of the week...not from anyone!! So that's minor, indeed! The food was great for breakfast and their snackbar lunches were really good. The dinners at the buffet were tasty, but after 3-4 days, were becoming a bit boring. The Italian restaurant (which required reservations) was very limited in its entree offerings and TOTALLY inconsistent. We ate there twice...once was really good; two nights later, not at all good. Hmm... The $30 USD for use in the spa was good toward a $45+ treatment. The manicure I had was by the cutest, sweetest girl whom I tipped $4 because of her demeanor, but my manicure looked like it'd been done by an 8 year old with a paint-by-numbers set...not even 'inside the lines'!! Luckily I was going home the next day and only had to sit on my hands for one evening! The beach has some erosion problems, with 2-3 large sand bags (don't step on them; they're slippery!!) but for exercise we were able to walk 400 yds down toward the Fishermen's 'other' beach club...and then walk another 100-200 yds on the street to arrive there where they had a mini-bar, beach chairs & bathrooms. I hear next year they're building an add'l restaurant there. There were always ample chairs around the pool, and down between the pool and the beach, as well as on the beach. A great location to 1)be lazy 2)walk into town-15 min 3) go for bike rides or 3) take day trips. Will we go back? Absolutely. We'll probably even do the Meal Plan again and just spring for a couple of meals on 5th Avenue to relieve the boredom. Hope this has been helpful.

My wife and I had our honeymoon at the Sunset Fisherman, and for two people who had spent the better part of the previous year planning and organizing and generally doing stuff, this was a great place to not do anything for a week. We did the all-inclusive thing, which included breakfast and lunch OR dinner. 2 meals a day is what we're used to anyway, so that was fine, but we did get some lunch a couple days at the lower restaurant, the food was above average each time, especially the guacamole. prices for food not included in the meal package were very fair, we put two lunches for the two of us and 20 minutes of internet on our room charge, and the total at checkout was less than $40 usd. There is an Italian restaurant for dinner that requires reservations, which can be your freebie if you have the meal plan, and the food and atmosphere was rediculously good. I would recommend the Italian dinner at least a couple times a week for a perfectly cooked steak, wonderful seafood, and flawless service. Besides the ala carte restaurant that was Italian for dinner (it was burgers, quesedillas, chips & salsa etc. for lunch), the terrace restaurant was pretty good. A buffet-style setup, this is where breakfast was served, also lunch and dinner. Breakfast was really good, an omlette bar, great breads, and lots of fruit even for the off-season. We heard from a lot of people staying there that the sunset fisherman had some of the best resort food around. This was our first resort, so we can't judge on that, but both my wife and I have spent enough time in the service industry to know good food and great service when we see it, and we saw it everyday. Tipping helps. Our room was superb. We had a 2-bedroom suite courtesy of her folks giving us their RCI points for a wedding gift, and it was sweet. It had a full kitchen, fully set dining area for 4 people, nice comfortable furniture, good lighting, and a tv if you want to waste your time that way. a balcony on the first and second floor, the bedroom being on the second. an excellent bed, huge and comfortable, with a jacuzzi out on the second-floor patio. a full, nice bathroom on both floors, stocked with shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and tons of towels. I have tons of pictures of the room and grounds, just email if you'd like me to send you some. We tipped our housekeeper the first night($15usd) and got nice turndown service after that. Please be generous with tipping, the employees really appreciate it and it makes your time there so much better when the staff likes you. we spent around $200usd in the week just on tips, and it was well worth it. Miguel, the bartender, remembered what we drank, and our service at the restaurants was consistent with what we'd expect anywhere else. If you want a big resort with tons of people around and lots to do, go somewhere else. If relaxing in the ocean/pool/30 foot hot tub sounds nice, stay here. You won't be disappointed, but if you are, it will be your own fault.

What you get is beautiful ocean, a great central-yet-secluded location, and very nice rooms (we stayed in a 2BR master suite, overlooking the ocean). Playa del Carmen is thus far my favorite vacation destination - the beaches are absolutely gorgeous, and the town of Playa is fun and close by. The location of this resort is a pleasant walk from town (I think it took us 15 minutes), and in an upscale gated community, surrounded mostly by private villas. Last time we were there was before Hurricane Wilma, but the photos I've seen posted online look like they've improved the beach to be even better than before the hurricane. The water is blue, clear and beautiful and the sand is white and lovely. I like the fact that the all-inclusive fees here are not ridiculous like most other all-inclusive resorts (and for owners they're optional). I actually also like the fact that the all-inclusive fees include only 2 meals per day (dinner plus breakfast or lunch) - at other resorts when we've done the all-inclusive option we always end up bored with the food (3 meals a day for 7 days at the same place!) and wanting to eat out in local restaurants for lunch or missing meals when we're out on excursions anyway. I understand they have re-done the pool since last we were there, but I loved the swim-up bar (I hear they still have this in the new post-Wilma pool). We also love exploring the area - Tulum is a must-see every time (bring a bathing suit so after you tour the ruins you can go swimming at one of the best beaches ever - how often can you swim in beautiful turquoise waters while looking at Mayan ruins on the cliff above you?). We've also been to see the ruins at Chichen Itza and Coba (both worth it).

The front desk fixed it though after talking with them for a while. And we ended up getting a single room for free so we all had somewhere to sleep! The lobby bar was awesome. The night bartender knew us after day one and made our drinks for us stronger if we wanted him to. He made suggestions on good drinks too! The drinks were not watered down at all. The bar closed 10:30 and we didn't like to go to bed that early so we would get extra drinks close to closing time and they never cared that we did that. The swim up bar was nice but service was a little slower there. The pool was great and the beach was nice.

The girls enjoyed the cooking classes, espeically since we got to eat the food afterwards. They played sports on the beach and even did salsa lessons. Not really any activities for kids but we didn't have any kids with us. In fact, there we very few kids in the whole resort. Overall we all had a great time.

We booked our transfers through the option available on the resort's website which was much cheaper than any other I found. We arrived at 7pm and there wasn't anyone else going there so they put us in a private car. Would have been great except the driver only used the fan. It was so humid that the windows were fogging up. Even though he was a 'sunset' driver he didn't have a clue how to get to our hotel once in Playa. That was the only setback other than the timeshare sharks. We had a 2 bedroom unit for only 3 people. The unit was HUGE, probably 1600sf and very nice. We were on the ground floor and had a patio off the living room and one off the master bedroom (which had a jacuzzi on the patio). The patio doors were double wide so had a great view inside even of the ocean. The cleaning people were probably in our room each day for 1-2 hours as there was so much space to clean. We had 2 bathrooms in our part and our daughter had a bathroom in hers so 3 full baths. Also had a full kitchen with all the amenities and a dining room. Housekeepers came in at night and picked up as well as turning down our beds. There are only 65 units here but it's amazing how many staff members there are. They work so hard and were probably the nicest people out of anywhere we have ever stayed. Even the night security guard always spoke, had a big smile, and a wave for us. He came up to me on our last night and said such nice things to me and asked if we'd be back next year. We did leave a tip each day for the maid along with a little gift. We also left something for the waiters but I never saw anyone else do it. I sat and watched the gardener trimming the grass around the restaurant with hand clippers. He had a bucket he'd pick the grass up and put it in there so there were no remnants. He worked so hard and it was so hot. I went over and gave him $5 which was all I had on me at the time and he was so shocked. I figured that the gardeners probably never got anything since they aren't on the 'front line'. Everyone raved about the spa so we tried it out. I've had a lot of massages and wasn't real impressed with the one I had. Their prices are really high so get recommendations from other guests before you book. I was told there are a couple people that are very good there. The massage tables are set up on the covered patio of the spa. It was so relaxing hearing the ocean waves during the massage as you are really close to the water. This resort isn't for anyone looking for a lot of action. It is very low key and laid back. There is an entertainment staff but they don't have a lot of organized activities. If you're wanting a nice hotel right on the beach where you can relax and unwind then it's a great place. Being so small we got to know a lot of the other guests and recognized them off resort. Being an rci exchange you are required to take the meal plan. The buffet wasn't bad at all and usually there were some really good choices. You can also eat at the ala carte restaurant. This is a 5 course meal and takes a good two hours to sit through it all. It was good but we aren't the type to drag out dinner all evening. You do need to make reservations for this restaurant ahead of time. The houses in this gated community are really nice. No one gets in without going through the security gate which was great for keeping the peddlers off the beach. In fact, I never saw one the whole week. The taxi's have to stay at the entrance to the community so they call down for one when you need it, no hassles from the cabbies wanting to take you somewhere either.

Every 5 years our Father takes my 4 brothers & sisters, our spouses, and all the grand-kids on a nice vacation, and this was the year for our big get-away. Since my wife and I had visited Fishermen's 3 years ago, and had a GREAT experience, we pushed hard for a return to Playa with the whole family. We knew about all the bad press surrounding the timeshare sales, but felt confident that if everyone would \"just say no\" to the promotions & give-aways, that they would all have a fantastic time. Ultimately, through searching the internet, my Father was able to book 6 condo units at Fishermen's for the prime week between Christmas & New Years, and give us all the trip of a lifetime. I cannot say enough about what an incredible week we all had!! With 29 family members to satisfy, in 6 different condo units, you would think that someone would have at least a small gripe .... I can honestly tell you that each and every one of us went away with rave reviews, and warm, cherished memories about our time spent at \"Sunset Fishermen Spa & Resort\". From the beautiful accommodations and meticulously maintained grounds, to the incredible food, and especially the warm welcome and family hospitality we received from each and every member of the staff, our stay could not have been more enjoyable. There was not one single thing that I can imagine that would make our week any better. The all-inclusive rates are more reasonable than any other resort in the Cancun / Riviera Maya area, and participation is optional!! The drinks were free-flowing, and delicious!! The resort shows absolutely no hint of damage from Hurricane Wilma (although we understand that they had to shut down for several months for repair!). The beach has large sand bag break-walls installed, and the beach has been almost completely restored. Absolutely every member of the staff greeted us with a smile and friendly greeting whenever we would pass (perhaps they all realize that they are living in paradise!!). I could go on and on ....... With all of these positive words, I have to mention the one person who stands out as the ray of sunshine that never failed to put a smile on our faces: Louis acts as the activities director, cheer-leader and all-around ball-of-energy, and truly fantastic guy. His personality, charisma, genuine love of people, and joy that he brings with his infectious personality, is an incredible asset to the resort. Whether he is playing games with toddlers in the kiddy pool, playing football on the beach with the pre-teens, or giving bartending lessons at the pool bar to the adults, this incredible guy has a gift for making everyone feel welcome, and part of his \"family\". We were able to celebrate a very memorable New Years Eve, with dining, music and dancing at poolside. Our new-found dear friend Louis gave a heartfelt New Year's dedication, and led a special release of balloons at midnight with everyone\u2019s wishes for the new year, that left most of the attendees in tears. As he made his way table-to-table around the pool, greeting all the guests, and extending his personal wishes for the new year, you really felt that this small family-oriented resort had discovered the \"key to happiness\", and was doing their very best to pass it along to their guests. I can't thank the Louis, and the entire staff enough for making our week so awesome. Keep up the great work ... we WILL be back!!!!!!!!

One of those people offered his assistance in providing traveling tips for Cancun. This person told us that they worked for local Mexican-owned resorts in Cancun to promote their businesses to American travelers. We were offered a no-obligation tour with a resort called Fishermen\u2019s Village, which operates under a business entity called the Sunset Group. They asked us to take a van ride to the hotel, eat breakfast, and take a look at their facility. In return, we were offered a free day-trip ticket to Chichen Itza, or other destination. We paid a $40 USD as refundable deposit to ensure we would show up. The tour assistant insisted we bring at least one major credit card, as those major credit companies are the \"sponsors\" of their promotion. We subsequently discovered that those companies are not related to the Sunset Group\u2019s promotion. At the agreed time the next day, a van driver came to our hotel and took us to the Fishermen\u2019s Village Resort. We were greeted by a hostess who asked us to show her our major credit cards. We were then introduced to a salesperson, Maureen Kimmel. Subsequently, Maureen told us this is a timeshare presentation, which we were not aware of until then. She asked if we own any timeshare properties and we said no. Maureen called her manager and said he would \"authorize\" Maureen to proceed with the tour even though we don\u2019t own timeshare property. We wouldn\u2019t have wanted to get involved if we knew that this was a timeshare presentation before this time. Maureen showed us rooms on the top floor with an ocean view. Obviously, being on the top floor and having an ocean view, the units were the best ones. Then, Maureen brought us to the sales office. The timeshare she offered us was very expensive, and we said no immediately. Then she called in her manager, Neil Cooper, and they brought out another offer called an \u201cinvestment package.\u201d They showed us how we could make a profit if we rented the property through their agent, Resorts International Marketing Corporation, with a one time processing fee of $549. We were promised that our timeshare would be rented out at $1,700 per week and would pay for itself within five years. Neil said it was a ''no lose investment.'' They also insisted that buying a membership in the Admiral Yacht Club would significantly increase our ability to rent our timeshare. We were not told that none of the amenities of the Admiral Yacht Club were in Playa del Carmen - they are all an hour away in Cancun. When we refused the timeshare, Neil offered to remove three VIP weeks from the first four years of the contract to lower the price. He also continued to promise rental income so we could afford to take our four children on vacation. After being placed under such duress, we finally agreed to sign the contract. When we agreed to sign the contract, Maureen and Neil opened a bottle of champagne and offered us glasses of it. Thus, we were under the influence of alcohol at the time we reviewed the contracts and signed them. When we reviewed the contracts, they sped through the paperwork saying \u201cyou don\u2019t have to even read this now.\u201d We were never notified of our five-day right to cancel the contracts. Upon returning home, we reviewed the contracts carefully and realized that many promised items were missing, including the promised rental income. At the time we signed the contracts, Maureen and Neil promised us that the timeshare would increase in value and could easily be rented or sold. After doing Internet research, we discovered that Sunset Group timeshares cannot be sold at any price. Nor can they be rented, even when offered at the standard maintenance fee. (See eBay.com and Google.com). They also told us we were investing in fixed price travel. However, the Sunset Group can and does raise its maintenance fee 6% or more each year. In June 2006, we sent Sunset Group a letter terminating the contracts. Now, they have sent our account to a collection agency, Resort Management International (RMI). RMI has called my parents and us repeatedly, yelling at us and threatening us if we do not pay for the rest of the contract.

I am not a salesman or Dumb@$$ as mentioned in another review, but a 15+-year exchange user of RCI exchanges. We stayed at Fishermen's 2 years ago and was satisfied, and aware of the current reviews, went back with some lowered expectations. Due to no available flights on Sat 6/18, we knew we would check in on Sun 6/19. I phoned, speaking with Pablo, on Sat to tell them we would be in on Sunday to be sure we would have a room. When we arrived, Pablo checked us in and we had one of the beautiful new studios right on the end next to the beach, just as he had promised me on Saturday. I also expected to be required to pay 7 days of meals plan, but since we checked in on Sunday and planned to be out Friday, they only charged for 5 days. Monica went thru our welcome packet and asked if we had any questions about the resort. We did not. She mentioned they now have 2 sister resorts if we were interested in touring. The next day another lady asked us if Monica explained everything and we said she had. Nothing else was mentioned about a tour or sales pitch. I got a 60-minute massage, discounted $30 as part of the mandatory meal plan. The meal plan was better than two years ago, no reservations required and food was more varied. We usually ate lunch and breakfast and dinner in town. We did Xcarta one day, by taking the local bus (colectivo) for 65 cents per person and taxied back that night for about $12. We took the Greenline from the airport to Fishermen's for $38 for 2, but maybe could've gotten cheaper tickets outside the airport. Everything in our room functioned correctly. The air conditioning was more than cool. We turned it down. Sometimes the water wasn't as hot as my wife likes, but it was OK for me. Service was great. We always offered a buenos dias, como es't, por favor and gracious, sometimes I left a small tip. The drinks were plenty strong. Some people just walked up and said \"beer\", without any manners at all. Names I remember were Jose and Alex at the bar, Louis the activity director, but there were several others that were VERY attentive. The room was cleaned everyday. Towels and kleenex were folded into swans and flowers. This is a small, quiet resort. Not many planned activities. You can use the free kayaks to paddle a couple of resorts down and rent jet skis, parasail or sail boat. We also enjoy the 15-minute walk into town. The beach is smaller than two years ago, but adequate. There were always plenty of lounge chairs and we particularly liked the hammocks on the beach, also always available. While waiting in line at the airport to return home, another couple mentioned they had toured Fishermen's and received $200 cash, and only had about a 90-minute tour. They said some others took about 3 hours, but they were OK with Fishermen's.

We had used a timeshare exchange through RCI, so we only have 3 choices of hotels for this area. The other two did not have more than 1 bedroom units, and my wife and I wanted privacy from our teenagers, so we went with FV. Let me set the record straight...we had a wonderful time there. Our vacation started out very badly. Our direct flight by US Airways was supposed to get us into Cancun at 11AM Saturday. Due to understaffing, we did not get into Cancun until 2AM Sunday!!! When we finally got to FV, at 3AM, we were warmly greeted. Our luggage was taken to our room and I was relieved to see we got the exact room we were promised. The rooms had two separate patios (they were 1st floor) and each had a jacuzzi tub on them. The view was breathtaking. We weren't more than 20 feet from the beach!!! The rooms were very nicely decorated. We had a minor problem with the A/C in the Master bedroom. They tried to fix it twice, wasn't perfect but was acceptable. Now to answer the dreaded TIMESHARE stories. The first day there we were politely asked to speak to one of their timeshare people. She started into her pitch and I told her we already owned one elsewhere. After 15 minutes and 3 no thank you's, on my part, we were released and NEVER bothered again. If you were brought there from another resort, I'm sure it would be much more difficult to get away from the sales pitch. Looking at previous pictures of the resort, it has lost a considerable part of it's beach. But since the resort only has around 90 units, there was plenty of beach to go around. We never had to get up early to reserve a chair. This was one great thing about FV, there were not wall to wall people like at the big resorts. As an RCI customer, we were required to do the AI. You got all the drinks you wanted (they were NOT watered down), breakfast, and either lunch or dinner. Breakfast buffet was very good. The lunch buffet got boring after a few days, seemed to be the same food all the time. I was advised to make reservations at their Italian sit down Rest. It was great! We ate there twice plus the service was really good. The other nights we walked into town to eat. This is another good thing about FV, it was only a 15 minute walk into Playa del Carmen. The walk was very romantic, through a residential area with flowering trees and Mayan ruins on one side, and the Carribean on the other. Very beautiful! Every night when we returned to FV, the Lobby Bartender Manuel warmly greeted us and prepared our favorite drinks. We did excursions, some on our own and some through AGI Tours. I won't go into detail here, but I would be glad to answer any questions for first timers or those that are interested. Julio (AGI Tours) took us on an all day trip to Chichen Itza. He was a wonderful personal tour guide. All in all I would recommend Fishermens as a good place to take your family. If you are looking for nightlife it is not at the hotel. Everything shuts down at 11PM, which we really appreciated! If you want to go wild, you are only a 15 minute walk into town, where all the bars are.

We had a group of 14 people including a lot of kids and we all had a great time. My only complaint - check in was a slow boring process where they try to get you to do a time share talk - however they gave us food and drinks the whole time and it was only about noon and check in isnt until 3pm anyway, so its hard to complain. The food was good - its wasnt great, it wasnt fantastic, but it was good, plenty to keep you filled and plenty of variety. They have a separate \"fancy\" restaurant also which serves really good food if you want that also. Drinks - they have dos equis (XX) on tap for beer - light and dark. That is the only beer.

There are no children around... and very few guests 4. Why do they need to see your VALID credit card? 5. Notice that there are NO JACUZZI'S on any balcony except the fake room (and they tell you that every room has a jacuzzi on the balcony) 4. It doesn't matter where you are from.. you're the lucky one because the boss is from there , and you will get a better break because their manager is from the same state or province or country that you are... they try to match you up with someone that you feel a bond with, that knows how things \"are\" back home. 5.

Slime tactics to be aware of: 1) they don't use last names, 2) they try to force you to sign a waiver so you cannot cancel a contract within the 5 business days allowed by Mexican law, 3) their contracts have no addresses or phone numbers, just \"Royal Fishermen's, S.A. De C.V\", called the \"Developer\", 4) they liberally toss in extra weeks to get you to sign, which they tell you can be rented for more than enough to cover your annual maint. fee; the rentals don't happen; the rental company does not even return your phone calls, 5) they refused to give me any hardcopy documentation of my cancellation (I had written a letter I made them sign--they said that was enough); others have been told the cancellation was not valid or legally done or too late or never received, no matter how valid or on time, and in certified mail, 6) the 10-year yacht club membership, the \"great\" $50/hr deal for \"million dollar yachts\"...well, they aren't million dollar yachts (although nice boats), and if used once a year, one afternoon (4-hr min. rental), the upfront price and all the fees add up to rack rate, which you could pay without any contract or obligation at all; all this presumes you could always rent one on each of your vacations, when you wanted, 7) even the freebie promised to get you on site to their sales pitch came with a $25 price tag--imagine that!--supposedly completely refundable after you year the pitch (but maybe not if you don't buy); they use the angle that the town-roaming salesperson has to guarantee his catch by getting money down up front, so another sales agent can't steal his quarry; others I've talked to never got the promised freebie at all (they didn't sign up for a membership). We got the freebie, got our $25 back (but only because we asked for it before we terminated). But we were later threatened to pay for it. Verbal threats made to us indicated we had to pay for some free stuff they had given us to juice the deal (food, massage) or we'd have to sue to cancel and ever get our money back. No way were we going to give them any more money! We were also threatened that Mexican laws on slander and libel prohibited us from bad-mouthing them in any way, even if what we said was true.

I tried to book a suite in December or January of 2004/2005 and was told nothing was available. This was in October when I contacted them. In November I tried again and was told they could fit me in at the end of March - Easter week! Although my contract and the timeshare pimp who sold it to me (Carlos the Chulango) said that 60 days is plenty ot time to book, the truth is they have way oversold the place. I visited there on Jan 3rd of 2005 to try and negotiate a way out as I still owe some cash (if you forget the fact they've already breached the contract). I even offered Luis, the new ladrone a few thousand to sell it off. He checked with his jefecita, Rosalea Perrita, and she called us back to say they \"we're not in a position to buy back any timeshares\". Big surprise there! They did tell me they have a total of 49 units available for use and are trying to buy back more units that were sold as condos. Interestingly they never mentioned during the sales pitch that some of the units they pointed to were not available to timeshare owners! When I asked how many timeshares they had sold, they just said 'Many'. That is the understatement of the year. Curiously, they offered me a place to stay after I told them I had already booked a condo and been in town a couple days. Amazing how nothing was available until I pressed the issue. Of course it was of no use to me as I was already prepaid at the condo. While we waited to talk to the timeshare pimps this time, they offered us drinks. The service was poor, as it was when I ate there a couple years ago, so I am at odds to understand the postings that indicate how great the staff is. Our bartender had the personality of drywall. When my fiance spoke to him in Spanish, her native toungue, he was still the same. I guess a rotten place like this even wears on the staff. If you buy a timeshare anywhere, realize they cannot easily be resold, if at all, and when it's possible to unload them, you can expect less than 50% of your money back.

It's amazing how many people are involved in these \"timeshare scams\". They start you out with a couple of nice \"local\" people that tell you things like, \"Yeah, all you have to do is just check out our rooms to see if you would like to stay at our hotel at some point during your vacation\", joke, none of the rooms are for rent. Once they get you in you have to go through a series of levels within the scam. Starts with the nice guy who shows you pictures of his family, tells you stories of the history of the area and shows you the staged, best view rooms in the complex. Kind of sad really because you know they are just trying to make a living. It's once they get into that one exit room that the fun begins. Again, the levels kick in, the first guy goes over the packages and of course there insanely high. At that point your just like \"well thanks, but I'm going to go with no as my answer\", after several drops in price and a lot of pen circling and disappointed looks from the person he reluctantly says \"OK, well you'll just have to give this next person a quick review and we'll give you your present\", at this point they say they will release you from captivity, oh, I mean let you leave of course...

Really, really sad. Well, we escaped, not until after three hours!!! Unbelievable. A whole day basically wasted. What they don't tell you is that it's almost impossible to rent out your timeshare, the room that they showed you in the beginning is not an example of the type of room you will get if you stay there and that getting a room for the week you want down the road is almost impossible as well. The main problem being that they have oversold these condos, apartments, rooms, whatever, into the ground.

I have to say that we were slightly pressured into the time share and were a little worried before we went. I want to warn people that if they do purchase a time share, that they not use the company that Fisherman's Village recommended to sell their extra weeks-Vacation Weeks---. Our deal was to purshase one week and they would give us three others to use or sell. The rep at Vacation Weeks was very nice in the beginning when they were trying to get the initial $500 fee from us. They told us to expect our first check within 60-90 days, well, it is almost a year later and nothing. And when you try calling them or sending emails, they do not respond. Anyway....Once we got to the resort, we had a slight problem with our room and we had asked to upgrade. Everyone right from the start was very nice. The time share that we purchased last year was a studio with two queen beds, a kitchenette, dining/living room. We had tried to use a second week, but were told over the past several weeks that there were none available. There were four of us using the time share, so we were hoping to get two bedrooms. On the second day, we were able to upgrade to a two story condo with 2 bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths and a beautiful view. They only charged us $200 to upgrade. I thought that was a pretty good deal! My husband, mother and I loved the resort. It was quiet and never very crowded, except for all of the time share groups coming through daily. They were not a bother, but more amusing then anything. Many mornings we had the pool almost exclusively to ourselves. The resort has snorkeling gear and kayaks which we used a few times. The sand was very soft unlike the resort that we stayed at last year that was near a coral reef. Last year's resort was better for snorkeling but very rough on your feet. My father is very restless so he prefers a resort with more things to do. For rest of us, it was perfect. We purchased the meal plan. I was also worried about this purchase after reading all of the negative reviews regarding the food and drinks. I was glad that we purchased the plan. I thought the breakfasts were very good, always a variety of fresh fruit and many other things to eat. We only had the lunch buffet one time and the rest of the time we simply got snacks at the pool bar. Our bartender, Manuel was fantastic. Very friendly and always remembered what we were drinking. We ate lunch at the pool bar every day and charged it our room. At the end of the week the tab for the snacks was only $50 for four people. The drinks we also thought were very good. I read a review saying that the drinks were watered down, well, if you feel that way, all you have to do is ask for them to put more alcohol in your mixed drink or simply get more. If you are lounging at the pool, the waiters also come around and bring you drinks. The dinners were okay. They had buffets and Italian night off of the menu. Italian night was good but they had that 3 nights while we were there. One night was enough of the Italian. We did however go into town two nights for dinner, which were not that great. We spent too much money. One of the tourists at the resort recommended Limones for Lobster, well we did not enjoy that restaraunt. My mother is a lobster fanatic and was very dissapointed. My husband and I also enjoyed massages outside on the patio at the spa. It was wonderful, very relaxing and all the while that you are getting the massage you can hear the ocean. Fantastic!! Again, I have to praise the staff. The ones that stuck out were Manuel-the bartender, Jose Louis- activity man, and Marcel, our bellboy. Everyone went out of their way to make this a great vacation for us. My husband and I are thinking about going back again in May with some friends. I would highly recommend this resort.

If you want nightlife or even casual shopping/walking/people watching, this is not the place for you. The hotel is nice. The staff is great -except for the Time Share Pimps. And the hotel management constantly bothers you every time they see you for more money for the meal plan, every day they asked me at least 2x when I am checking out, settling my bill (all of 5 pesos come on!) and when I am paying for my meal plan -all this was paid before I even got on the plane and by day 3 of this, it got rather old. The plus side to this is that the Time Share Pimps only hassle you if they can tell you are over 40. As if being over 40 means you have money. For me, at 32, with money to invest if anyone asked, it was a relief. Visually, it's awesome. We had problems with our A/C units leaking (kitchen and master bedroom in room 349) and numerous calls to maintenance really didn't do much. The morning slip n slide in the kitchen was extremely dangerous and we're grateful no one got hurt with falls. The drywall is sagging and warped from the leaking and we had bets to when it was just going to crash out of the ceiling. The electrical layout is scary. There are outlets on the floor for the TV and cable... which is not far from where the water pools from the leaking A/C. Terrible design concepts. It seems par for the course at this place, however, considering the maintence people ran live wires across the pool, and draped into the pool for their power tools -this was an electrocution in the making. If a guest didn't see the pieced-together extension cords, forget it, there would have been serious problems. No real regard for the safety of the guests with this situation, they still allowed people to swim in the pool while this work was going on. The meal plan is a rip-off. Save your money. Buy your booze in town, make lots of ice and make your own drinks. The drinks at the bars are a joke, they are so watered down it's laughable. And the pool bar closes at 5 and the lobby bar closed at 9:30-10pm most nights. The latest it was open was 10:05. If you have any sort of pulse in the evenings, this isn't the place to be. Of course, even if you have a pulse, an hour or two listening to a panflute version of the soundtrack to the Titanic will make you wish for your pulse to cease. Breakfast was a debacle. The food was crummy and limited unless the Potential Time Share Victims were bussed in. Then breakfast was plentiful, many options, but good luck getting anything when the Time Share Promoters are there because they bully you, they are rude to you, unless you're there to be schmoozed into making them some commission, forget it, they will treat you like garbage. The staff is obviously taught that the potential victims are more important than the regular guests (probably because they already got their commissions from the regular guests) and it made for subpar service. When there were no potential time share victims, breakfast was horrible but the service was great. Lunch meal plan is a joke. Again, don't waste your money. The snack bar is nice (by the pool) and a little more worth the $ if you're not on the meal plan. Dinner was repetitive, recycled leftovers and generally boring. Only 2 nights wes there something different. Save your money, eat in town, it's a far better experience. The tours offered through the hotel concierge are such a rip off scam, it baffles me how people fall for it. Tulum, $100 per person. XCaret $126 per person. PER PERSON! Cozumel day trip $75 per person. Are these people on crack? Who would pay this to do anything? Stupid tourists will pay it and will continue to pay it, which is how they get away with ripping you off even more. Don't be a fool. And don't buy into the scams to get you into time share pitches just to get a cheap entry or cheap tour. You have to provide your credit card and ID (to prove you can afford to be there) but if you're foolish enough to surrender your credit info to some guy in a booth, well you deserve to be ripped off. Once you say \"I don't have a credit card\", they're done with you. Just avoid the hassles. And if you don't say anything figuring you'll just drop the bomb on them once you're wherever it is they're taking you, they'll leave you there. 5 of us went to Tulum (including food and transportation) for $75. If we went thru the hotel, that'd be $500. ALL of us went for $75. Take the free hotel ride into town, take the bus for $3 and the entry to Tulum is only $3.80. When you're in town, buy a couple bottles of water and a snack. On the way back, barter with a taxi or van driver. If you can read, you can navigate Tulum. 6 of us went to XCaret for a little more mainly because XCaret is about $50 U.S. But we took the van into town, batered with a driver and got a ride there for $20, went around XCaret for the whole day, and got a ride back for $15. Again, if you can read, you can navigate XCaret fine enough on your own. If you have a good zoo/rainforest/eco park near your home, save your money. The swimming area smells like a cesspool, the snorkeling isn't all that great because they let in zillions of kids -how many fish are going to stick around for that commotion? It's really not worth it unless it's the only place you can see such things. Cozumel was the biggest farce at $75. HAHAH!!! Again, take the free hotel ride to town. You walk to the ferry, buy your RT ticket for $18. Go have a meal, shop around, barter with a taxi to get you where you want to go. Even with shopping, I only spent a total of $45, including generous tips and real alcohol (certainly wasn't getting any at the hotel!) The only thing I saw people do here that was stupid was go when the cruise ships are docked. Does no one know that prices will be MORE when this happens and not LESS? Go after 2pm -you can see the ships from Playa- when the ships go off, that's when you go to Cozumel. Drinks during cruise time were 2 for $5, 2 for $6. We drank later in the day, they were 2 for $3 or buy one get one and all the cheesy shopping was much much cheaper. Cozumel is a big tourist trap if you're stupid. I'm definitely staying at the Royal Sunset in Cancun next year. At least there one can have a pulse and experience life after dark. I'll never do a meal plan again. It's cheaper to go to the market and buy bottled water and liquor and eat at the area restaurants. Plus it's much more fun and a better way to meet people. This trip was great because of the people and if I ignore the hotel situation and location and the tiny beach. The staff was wonderful, friendly, social, and very willing to give you a heads up on where the good places are to go. If you're a generous tipper, you'll be treated like royalty. If you're a stingy bugger, you'll get standard service. But this goes for anywhere. What got this hotel a lower rating for me was the A/C situation, the skimpy supply of towels (we had 6 people and had to trek to the front desk every day for adequate towel supplies, where again we were met with asking for more money or blank stares from management. If you are able to find general staffers, seek them out for your needs, management doesn't do anything but hassle you for money) lack of equipment (snorkeling and boogie boards) and the fact that every day we tried to rent something, we were told the surf was too rough. Isn't that the point? But the surf wasn't rough at all. There are a lot of rocks and concrete once you get to about knee deep out in the water. And no one tells you they're there, but you'll gash up your feet pretty quick. Watch out for the jellyfish, too, when rain is imminent. The snorkel guy will tell you they don't bite, but we have stings all over to prove otherwise. Thankfully nothing toxic enough to get anyone sick, but to tell guests lies isn't conducive to good customer relations.", "Date": "May 18, 2004"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Sunset Fishermen Spa & Resort", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d275866-Reviews-Sunset_Fishermen_Spa_Resort-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$291 - $420*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Bahia del Espiritu Santo #9</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Playacar</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "275866", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/ProviderThumbnails/dirs/94/60/9460873e3681416106a505d6d616b9661large.jpg"}}
