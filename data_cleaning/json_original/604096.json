Unfortunately we missed our flight and had to return to Amsterdam to stay one more night and somehow rebook our flights..with very little budget or time at 11.30 pm and raining outside..we stopped at The Dam Hotel, due to the location being situated right next to Central Station. We were greeted by the night Receptionist Quadeer - what a gentleman..not only did we manage to secure a room at a great rate, we were also allowed access to the internet, a pc and a printer to rebook our flights and print out our boarding pass. We weren't expecting much but we were pleasantly surprised when we reached the rooms. it was big spacious and immaculately clean - unfortunately we were only looking for a quick nap and away again the next day it would have been great to stay longer..but for the price and the hospitality we received I will most definitely return. It is a pity there are not more people in the world like the hotel staff Quadeer he really helped us and although it was late at night he was not annoyed by us and the requests to use his personal facilities, he was very friendly, told me to relax, take a seat and it would be okay.

It's not a hotel in any way, shape or form. On the plus side, it was very central and Amsterdam itself is stunningly beautiful. Reviewers moaning about the steep stairs and the fact that some of the staff didn't speak English, should maybe go and stay in an English-speaking country. There was a working colour TV with several channels on in my room (203). Negatives: Room was not very clean - toothpaste and other stains on sink and decor in general was unkempt. My window was in fact actually a glass pane leading on to a housekeeping cupboard, so I could not look outside or air my room at all. The housekeeping cupboard must have led to a skylight as natural light came in, but also a lot of draught, which made the room cold at times. There was no heater to warm the room/dry your things on when it rained. Despite the signs warning guests that they would be fined for smoking in the rooms, I could smell normal cigarettes and cannabis being smoked regularly from other rooms in the corridor, along with loud music and drunken yelling. This made it difficult to sleep, especially as the housekeeping cupboard that adjoined my room was only locked with a small cheap padlock and I was constantly afraid of someone breaking in as a drunken prank. I would definitely not recommend this hotel for female solo travellers and made sure I noted down the names of as many decent looking hotels as possible while I was there so I never have to stay here again!", "Date": "February 9, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Worcester, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cDAM [--] HOTEL.

Its in a good location but the hotel is disgusting, it has a foul stench throughout the hotel and the rooms were small and dirty. We obviously knew we was going to get something cheap, but what happened over night was disgusting. We both slept, and while sleeping, i woke up twice and saw TWO different BUGS walking around the bed, we swept it off and thought nothing of it, until i woke up with an ITCHY RASH on my neck. It itched so badly, we left the hotel, and during the day, the rash got worst and it spread all over my arms and my body. I had an allergic reaction to all the BED BUG BITES from that hotel, I couldn't go to work and the itching was so bad its unbearable. Still itching now, and its been a week, a few days after we came back, the bites and rashes started to come up on my boyfriends body, incredibly itchy and irritating and disgusting. We wanted a cheap hotel, and we can deal with untidy and dirty, BUT BUGS biting you while you sleep is unacceptable. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!! THE PRICE IS NOT WORTH THE BUGS AND THE BITES!

I'VE NEVER WRITTEN A REVIEW ABOUT ANYWHERE BEFORE I HAVE ABOUT THIS HOTEL JUST BECAUSE ITS SO DISGUSTING AND I WOULDNT WISH THE ITCHY BITES AND RASHES ON ANYONE ELSE.

Dam Hotel is locaated in the very center of all the action in Amsterdam and made doing things very simple but that is where I draw the line. Dam hotel is the worst hotel of all time. First of all it is nearly impossible to find because you must go up a set of stairs to the front desk and the sign outside the door in not the name of the hotel, or at least the name has been changed and not been updated on the internet. To get to our room we had to climb Mt. Everest. The stairways are basically like climbing a ladder they are so steep and narrow. Our room was on the third floor and when we opened our door to room 308 what did we find, another set of stairs. In our four bed room we had a set of mattresses that were nearly impossible to sleep on they were so stiff. In addition to the bed we were not given ample sheets and covers. The beds come with an elastic sheet to cover the mattress and one comforter. NO SHEETS! the room was either freezing cold or unbearably hot as we tried to sleep. This is where things get fun...good luck trying to sleep because there will more than likely be mice crawling all around the room while you sleep digging through your trash and food. We were tortured by mice every night we were there and got a severe lack of sleep. We discovered a giant mouse hole in the wall behind the radiator. I was woken up several times by the sounds of mice scratching around in the walls. The room did have a TV but with 3 channels that work for maybe 1/3 of the time when they are covered in static and squeaking sounds. My guess is the the cable wires have been chewed to shreds by mice in the walls. Then came the bathroom situation. There is one toilet and one shower for the whole floor. The shower is a glorified closet with water shooting out and smells of feet and mildew. The toilet is nearly unusable because of the overwhelming stench of urine and puke that the floor is covered in. With the mice, the never ending ladder of a staircase, and the awful smells and cleanliness of the entire place, I'd have to say this was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in and if i wasn't very tired and exhausted from a long weekend at the coffee shops I could not have done it.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "2", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Shanklin, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cGood Location but not much else\u201d", "Author": "Steven2482", "ReviewID": "UR108010459", "Content": "Good location, The hotels was very run down, our two rooms were clean but very tired the shower rooms when we came back at the end of the day stunk all in all not good but pretty cheap for amterdam,", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Helsinki", "Title": "\u201cIf you have another choice perhaps you should choose that one instead!\u201d", "Author": "ank221060", "ReviewID": "UR89722217", "Content": "This is a backpacker hotel and that is both being kind to the hotel and not very respectful about backpackers who probably do not really have to stoop so low!

The \"lobby\" is on the second floor, up a very narrow staircase. The gentleman was pleasant and explained that the hotel was in two buildings. My room was back down the stairs across the restaurant next door and up a similar set of stairs. I have seen bigger closets. The double room consisted of a bed and a very narrow walkway to the entrance. There was a useless wardrobe at the end of the bed and no place to put our one piece of luggage. We put it on the floor to open it and found we could not open the bathroom door or exit the room. The TV did not work and there was no telephone. There was a door that opened onto the street from which we had marvelous views of Damrak Street and the filthy roof of the restaurant. This was the bright spot in the stay. The bath was barely acceptable with no bath mata and only two worn towels. On the plus side there was plenty of hot water and the bath and room were fairly clean. We found the maid service to be adequate. The strength of the internet signal was poor but it actually worked. The lobby has no printer. If you need to print something, there is a internet cafe about 6 blocks away.

This allowed us to notice the grubby old carpet, which - combined with the mouldy shower curtain in the ensuite and the generally unclean state of the place - was more than a little unpleasant.

We had absolutely no problems apart from our friends room having a smelly toilet - as we were out 95% of the time it wasn't a huge issue. The combined money exchange/check-in is a bit disconcerting at first but the staff were friendly. The location is excellent and not too noisy at all, we had a 2nd floor room facing onto the Dam. There are steep stairs to climb, if you arrive when the restraunt is closed so you can't get to the lift. The rooms were clean and not too small.

It is in a central location, yes, but there are many other hotels in the same area that I'm almost positive would be better than this one because this hotel was the absolute worst place I have ever stayed in. I had made reservations through an online booking site in July because the hotel itself does not have its own Web site. We arrived in the middle of the night in September, cold and tired from an international flight (and on our honeymoon!), and the very rude check-in staff informed me he had GIVEN my room AWAY because I was \"late.\" They have a 24 hour check-in desk and I had reservations, yet I was late??? He informed me that \"luckily\" he had a room to spare, but it turned out to be a tiny single room with a horrible mold smell, for which I still had to pay the price of the double I had earlier reserved. In addition, I paid in cash, to which he said he had no change and would give it to me in the morning. When I asked for a receipt confirming this, he yelled, \"DO I LOOK LIKE A THIEF TO YOU???\" How rude! I couldn't sleep all night. The next morning, there was another lady staffing the counter who seemed puzzled at first when I asked for my change but eventually gave it to me in an abrupt fashion.

If you are looking for a clean and affordable place to stay, the Dam Hotel is great. I was traveling alone, so had a \"single\" room. I can't say what larger rooms are like. But my room was comfortable, with two thick cots (smaller than a twin bed, but not flimsey like a typical cot), and a private bathroom with a commode, sink, and shower. All linens were provided. Up until midnight, there is elevator service via the adjoining hotel (even after midnight, I was able to walk up the stairs to the first floor and then take the elevator the rest of the way up, but I can't guarantee that is always possible). My particular room had a great view out over Damrak. Because Damrak is a busy area, there was a considerable amount of street noise, but as the night wore on, the noise level diminished. The street noise was primarily people walking, although there were taxis and trolleys in the area as well. The location of the Dam hotel is perfect. It is approximately 2 blocks south of Central Station. There is an information center outside of the Central Station. Across the street from the hotel, slightly to the right, is the entrance to the red light district. Dam Square is several blocks south. There are many restaurants and tourist shops in the area. I felt perfectly safe walking alone, even at night - although in the red light district I did have to keep my chin up and my eyes focused forward when some men began calling out \"Hey baby\" and other catcalls.
