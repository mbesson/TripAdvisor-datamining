It's a place with lots of character. Rooms are a good with all the key things a/c fan safe tv fridge etc and most importantly was very clean. The staff were brilliant, always friendly, helpful and very competent in many languages. Alfredo was great to helping me practise my spanish. He also conspired with Girisa to decorate my room on my birthday. Thank you a wonderful touch. Oscar and Dominique were also full of helpful advise. All the staff seemed to really enjoy working in the Hacienda Mariposa and it's sister hotel Pasado Mariposa. A team like this really make a good hotel into a great hotel. (sorry if I've got any names wrong) The only negative comments are that it can be a noisy especially as there is an italian restaraunt inside the hotel. Though it was quiet at night. Also the wifi is limited to the reception area, which was ok, but the reception was very hot during the day. All in all I had six very enjoyable nights at the Hacienda and would definatly revisit.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "bh16b 5qp poole", "Title": "\u201cExcellent hotel, great staff.\u201d", "Author": "hammerman38", "ReviewID": "UR125419784", "Content": "We had a wonderful holiday in Playa Del Carmen, helped greatly by our stay in this hotel, with some of the friendliest and most helpful reseption staff you'll find anywhere. Although our room couldn't be described as luxurious, it was quite large with ample room for the two double beds. The good sized ensuite bathroom had a lovely powerful shower and everything worked well, after a slight problem with the water pressure was sorted out within an hour of it being reported. The air-con was very powerful and there's a large ceiling fan. We had paid for a superior room and were in room 24, which is situated on the corner of the top floor. Which gives it a double aspect, with the small bathroom window looking out onto calle 24 and the larger bedroom window facing 5th Ave. So we had plently of natural light and it appeared to be larger than the standard rooms, which had the bedroom window facing into the central atrium and only the small bathroom window facing the street. Which would reduce the amount of natural light available. The location of the hotel is just about perfect. Right in the heart of the action on 5th Ave, but 12 blocks north of the main clubbing area. Most of the nearby restaurants were closed by midnight and except for the occasional reveller returning to their hotels from the night clubs, there was hardly any noise after midninght. It's only about ten minutes from the beach and the hotel supplies beach towels every day and a voucher for half price sun loungers and umbrella's at Marmitas beach club. There's a very popular Italian restaurant at the hotel. Breakfast is served at another Italian eatery just a couple of minutes walk away. Where although you would have to pay extra for a choice from the mani menu, there is plenty of choice from the 6 set menu's that are available on a B and B basis. The nearest to a \"Full English\" is the American breakfast, but we found that by choosing a different option each, we could have a really good selection, with unlimited toast and coffee. The hotel was perfect for our needs and we would not hesititate to stay there again, if we could have the same, or similar room. But I'm not sure about the standard rooms and would reccommend paying the extra $10 per night for a superior room. The best things about the hotel are the staff and the location.", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "San Diego, California", "Title": "\u201cGreat value for its location right on Playa del Carmen\u2019s northern popular 5th Avenue and close to Playa\u2019s best beach\u201d", "Author": "Wayne D", "ReviewID": "UR125289210", "Content": "Hacienda Mariposa is a great value for its location right on Playa del Carmen\u2019s northern popular 5th Avenue and close to Playa\u2019s best beach.

Recently re-done, location is really good - north end, close to my favorite places (beach, restaurants, cafes) and away from the really busy south end of 5th, which is my preference. Our room was spacious (room #30 - 3rd floor) - two double beds, great closet space, small TV stand with shelves for more clothes, plenty of room in bathroom, mini-fridge. Maid service was excellent. We were diving all week and always had lots of sand and gear in the room - every day it was spotless after they cleaned. The staff was very friendly and never had any concerns about security (i.e. my laptop was left unsecured - albeit hidden - and we had lots of dive gear, etc and no problems). Our friend's room was TINY (room #10 - 2nd floor). She was staying by herself and they gave her a VERY small room for the same price we paid. We paid $52.00 per night (3/2 - 3/10) and booked on cheaprooms.com. Couple of things I did not like about the hotel. The biggest thing was that it was NOISY. Very noisy and you could hear everything in your room. There is a restaurant in the hotel that is in the courtyard (the rooms are above it and look down on the courtyard). The restaurant opened early and closed late (lots of banging dishes, silverware -- normal kitchen noise). A few nights, people (we think they were staff) would stay at the bar doing shots and were very loud. On more than a few nights, they woke me up from a sound sleep in the wee hours of the AM. Also, you can hear anyone talking in the hallways on the way to their room - even if they were being respectful in trying to keep their voices down. In my friend's room, you could very clearly hear her neighbors - especially when they were fighting! Two small things I didn't like were the free wi-fi was sketchy at best and I was never able to sign in with the hotel's password - had to use the restaurant's network & password or go across the street to the cafe & hop on an unsecured site. Also, the refrigerator barely worked - took 4 days to get a mini-can of diet coke cold. Overall, out of 10, I'd rate it a 6 due to the noise level - and I can sleep through almost anything! If it weren't so noisy, I would have easily overlooked the wi-fi and the fridge issues. Would I stay there again? No. Would I recommend to someone else? Probably not - only because I know there are places that are the same price (and cheaper) that come more highly recommended.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Edmonds, Washington", "Title": "\u201cTop notch service, price, cleanliness, food and concierge.
