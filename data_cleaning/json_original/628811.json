However the rooms were old, the furniture was dirty and stained, and the hall carpets smelled of mold. The restaurant has buffet-style food that is OK. However, I believe the selection of food is highly limited to tourist-oriented bland and uninspired versions of Turkish food. I would have liked more authentic fair as the buffet food all starts to look and taste the same after a few days. The grounds are well kept and provide a nice environment for a casual stroll. I did not swim, but the slide and pool appeared to be great fun for the kids. The internet service in the room never worked.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "4", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Ramallah, Palestine", "Title": "\u201cOne of my favorites, room was kind of old though\u201d", "Author": "Sana E", "ReviewID": "UR120620376", "Content": "We stayed at this resort for 3 nights, and I loved it.

Hotel has great pool and beach facilities, a bowling alley and sports area and a health suite. Rooms are basic, the local love of smoking makes them smelly and they are well worn in particular in the bathrooms and the stained carpets, ripped cutains that do not close. This year the reception service was poor, its not normally, but on check in I was ignored whilst several Turkish guests checked in loudly around me and on check out they just could not add up the bill - be prepared to wait AGES and be prepared to be LOUD to get any service at all. Buffet meals - included in my book in price - are uninspired, restaurant menu if its working is ok, there are decent vegetarian options on both menu.

Many things just don't function there, especially service. We were at the trip combining leisure and business. No matter what we asked, there always was a problem, either it is to call the taxi or clean Your room that has not been clean or exchange the minibar fridge that was not working. You have to tell them 3-4 times before they do anything about them, but all the time they say You \"Don't worry it's on the way\". When we wanted to rent a car, and contacted reception, they were eager to help. And then we were waiting for the car that was \"on the way\" as receptionists told us for 2 days!!!! We had to postpone the business meetings for 2 days. Such waste of time and money! No matter what You ask personnel is just saying what You want to hear, lying in the eyes, and doing nothing with that.

The furniture in the whole hotel (especially in the public areas, rooms and even fitnessroom) needs to be renewed. The housekeeping ladies did their best to clean everything to the last detail, but as long as the furniture looks old, there is not much one can do to improve the optic. Another minus point: one can not really swim in the Marmara Sea located right infront of the hotel (quiet dirty) but the swimmingpools were marvellous. We booked halfboard meaning breakfast and dinner - both were perfect (big variety of food and delicious - we even thought of taking the cook with us back home :-). The market within the hotel is a joke, since it provides (beside daily newspaper and pool towels) nothing of relevance to the client. But there is a very big shopping center (Maxi) in the near vicinity to which a \"dolmus\" (transfer) service exists. Overall, I left the hotel relaxed and quiet happy after a week.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Muharaq", "Title": "\u201cgreat resort, frindly staff, delicious food\u201d", "Author": "ksayar", "ReviewID": "UR36400745", "Content": "Very nice Resort, a big rooms, friendly guys & girls in the reception, really good food, needs a renovation. I'm now staying in Klassis resort in Silivry( 1 hour from Istanbul \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Turkey ) for 3 nights, this is my third time staying in this resort, the resort is great, the reception guys & girls are very friendly & always smiling & speaking English very well not like other hotels in Turkey. Location: it is just 5 minutes by taxi from down town & from nice mall called Maxi City. Food: The food in Klassis resort is wonderful, you can find so many kinds of starters & main & sweets, & all are realy delicious, & the location of the food hall is fantastic facing the pool & the sea. Rooms: I stayed in room No. 352, it is nice & big & facing the sea & the pool, I think all rooms are facing the sea. there is 3 point I didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like in Klassis Resort: 1.bathroom is little bet old & needs renovation, & the furniture as well. 2.the rooms has no safety box, so we should get down to keep our money & expensive things. 3.key of the room is very heavy. 4.the whireless internet is weak & not fast, but I can open the pages.
