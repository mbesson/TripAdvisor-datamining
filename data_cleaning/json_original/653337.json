We were able to get the room for a \"3 night special\" of $99, which made this a very good value. The room was a dbl queen, with typical furnishings, beds were not plush, but comfortable, very clean and well maintained. The AC was a little loud, but it worked well during a hot season. The outdoor pool and hot tub were nice. The staff was friendly, and overall the property was well maintained and clean. Our room was on the second floor (only two floors) w/o an elevator. It is conveniently located towards the west end of the strip, with easy access, near restaurants, show theaters, shopping, and other attractions. Breakfast was limited to donuts, waffles, and cereal. We gave this an \"average\" rating because of the many motels we've stayed in at Branson, there wasn't really anything to set this one apart from the other good ones. It's pretty \"no frills\" basic. We would stay here again. (Note: We've had friends stay here in the past, and we did NOT see any signs of some of the negative reviews mentioned of this motel.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Conway, Arkansas", "Title": "\u201cWe hated it !\u201d", "Author": "Yankeetruckers", "ReviewID": "UR131596883", "Content": "We purchased a Branson vacation package from Terina Marketing and this was the hotel they put us in. We hated it so bad we went home and learned an expensive lesson about vacation packages since we couldn't get our money back. Upon first opening the door to the room it smelled horrible of cigarrette smoke (mind you I'm a heavy smoker and one of the weird people that like the smell of smoke) but this smell was overwhelming even for me. The next thing we notice is all of the holes burnt into the filfthy carpet, then the sign on the toilet advising you to continue to hold the handle down through the whole flushing cycle. Really?? Fix the toilet people, it's not that difficult. Then I noticed a dirty throw rug on the floor by the door, I lifted it up and it was covering a big rip in the carpet, OK, I can see that, but there was actually a clean spot on the carpet where the throw rug was, the carpet was so filfthy that you could see the outline of the throw rug. The TV screen was about the size of my laptop screen, yellow dripping on the walls from the years of smoke, and a wonderful view of the parking lot.
