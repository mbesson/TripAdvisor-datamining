Breakfast didn't have much variety, but there was fresh out of the oven bread and croissants.

It was easy to find when arriving by car and not difficult to get in and out of Madrid, if touring other place like Segovia and Toledo, excepting peak periods. The day of our arrival was a public holiday and the person on the duty desk did not speak any English; nevertheless we received a very friendly and courteous welcome. The apartment was small but functional. It was very clean but smelt very strongly of cigarettes. The d\u00e9cor is fairly tired and scruffy in places but it was always well cleaned every day. The cleaning staff were friendly. The breakfast room was on the fourth floor accessible by the old fashioned and rather small lifts. Breakfast can be described as functional, the coffee was fine but the food was pretty poor compared to other places we have stayed. The breakfast area could hold about 30 persons and at times there was a huge queue outside. It helped to think in advance about when most people were likely to turn up in order to avoid a 30 minute wait. Internet access is available at \u20ac 6 per 24 hours; it was surprising to have to pay for that when these days most places offer it for free. Apartamentos Recoletos is situated in the district of Salamanca, a rather chic area with expensive clothes and jewellery shops and consulates, but almost devoid of shops where you could buy food basics such as bread or milk. The only place we found was a shop/self service restaurant called VIP across the main road (Paseo de Recoletos) in the Calle de G\u00e9nova, opposite the Colon metro station. The VIP self service restaurant was good for a simple low cost meal (about \u20ac 10 for the Menu del Dia). Car parking outside the Apartamentos Recoletos was frankly horrendous. We arrived at the end of the afternoon and thanks to the Easter holiday period, we were able to leave the car outside on the Calle de Villanueva the whole weekend at no cost. The problem was when everybody started back to work on Monday. If you are lucky enough find a place then its \u20ac 1 or 2 for an hour starting at 08h00 until 20h00; you can only park in the same place once. There were lots of traffic wardens out at 08h00 ! The alternatives are underground parking; there are several nearby. These will cost you \u20ac 30 per day in cash, no credit cards accepted. We had no choice but to pay out \u20ac 60 for two days. I appreciate I've laboured this point a bit, but bear in mind that a 5 day stay could cost you \u20ac 150 in parking unless you want to get up every day at 07h30 and spend your vacation looking for a parking place ! Next time we visit Madrid we'll pay more attention to that. Apart from my moan about parking, I have to say that it was a very convenient place to stay for visiting central Madrid. It was easy to walk to Calle Gran Via and Sol in 10-15 minutes, the same time it takes to walk to the museums (Prado and Thyssen) with the Reina Sofia another 5 minutes. The Retiro Park is equally close. To travel further afield you can use the Metro from the Colon stop across the Paseo de Recoletos. Overall we were satisfied with our stay but bear in mind the supplementary costs like parking that can be a disagreeable surprise.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Lisbon, Portugal", "Title": "\u201cCheap and old but well located\u201d", "Author": "Santiago P P", "ReviewID": "UR121975100", "Content": "This is not a very nice place to stay. In other words, if you are going for a romantic weekend in Madrid with your significant other, don't choose this hotel for your stay.

However, if you are in Madrid alone for business and for a short time (for example, if you have to work at the Spanish National Library), then this could be convenient for you, because it is cheap and very well located, a few meters away from Plaza Col\u00f3n and Paseo de Recoletos.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "1", "Overall": "1.0", "Value": "1", "Sleep Quality": "1", "Rooms": "1", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Jerusalem", "Title": "\u201cIt was hard to communicate in english\u201d", "Author": "Szuk", "ReviewID": "UR119133994", "Content": "My overal rating of this hotel is poor.

The hotel is in a very bad condition, almost everything is broken or works as if it would be soon. Despite having 4 elevators only 1 was working, I had to pull the door very hard to open it. The room had a small kitchen which was suposed to be equipped but was not. The kitchen had no ventilation and was dirty. The cleaning ladies did not clean the kitchen a single time during my nearly one month stay. The room had only one working power outlet. The AC control panel was analog and in spanish, but it was not cooling but throwing stinking air into the room. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone.

We had one of the interior rooms, so the view was not much, but it was quiet. The breakfast is typically Spanish, that means lots of pastry or toast with jam. If you are used to have cheese or ham, forget it. On the other hand, you can bring your own cheese, or yogurt or whatever you fancy to the breakfast room. You enjoy your stay more if you know at least some Spanish: the receptionists usually reply in Spanish to your question asked in English.

We just had cabin luggage with a few changes of clothes, as there is a washing machine and dryer available. Saved us a fortune on the flight.

Unfortunately you had to go up a few steps to get into theis room, which made it very scary with the toddlers around (one of them actually fell off them...) There was a small kitchen with a fridge (great in Hot Madrid). The photo's on the original website of this hotel makes it look a lot better than the actual looks... Apositive thing is that it is very centrally located and the neighbourhood was fine.
