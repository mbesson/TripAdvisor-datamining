First off, it was unfortunate that we were let off the ship at 7 am on a Sunday morning. We took a taxi from the cruise terminal to the hotel, but they wouldn't let us check in until 1 pm (which is a standard policy that I am aware of - however I had e-mailed a few days in advance letting them know about our plight and asking for an early check-in. It was not to be, but oh well). Our biggest issue was the room. We had no idea that it would be twin beds in a tiny room (and I mean tiny - our stateroom on the ship was a mansion compared to this room) and that our small window would look out into an alley with some sort of screen keeping us from seeing the sky. One of my biggest concerns was the risk of fire - there was no way out of our room except down the stairs or down the ancient elevator. The toilet would not flush properly, and we never were able to get the TV to work. I understand that a lot of people don't come to Barcelona to relax in their hotel room, but if you are anything like me, you need a moment away from the crowds from time to time. (Oh, and crowds in September...Be very prepared for these). Overall, our room cost about $345 US, and I felt it was a pretty poor value compared to the Eurostars Grand Marina, where we spent the night before our cruise. (We were not able to get the same hotel for two different nights due to how busy the city was at the time we visited).

The rooms have two twin beds pushed together into a king sized formation, but one of the beds can be rolled away. We had a little trouble figuring out the A/C system (the control isn't marked and there are no instructions) and were cold the first night! It works well, though! Rooms on the front of the hotel have small balconies and huge windows that open double wide, which is great when the temperature is nice outside. With the windows closed there was surprisingly little noise, and the curtains did a great job blocking out light. There's a 2.5 euro deposit per day to use the room safe, but they refund it when you turn back in the key. Breakfast was included, and was a pretty standard set of breads, meat, pastries, cheese, and juices, as well as cereal, yougurt and such.

The staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and spoke english very well. They offered a number of recommendations on restaurants close by, and tapas bars.

Jousephe, Ila, David and Carolina are wonderful. Always ready to answer questions and to give you advice. The lobby, which is located on the second floor, has wine and pastries from 2 to 9 p.m. (all you want to drink and eat). Breakfast is great. For about 14 Euros you get all you can eat fruits, eggs, ham, pastries, toast, cheeses,coffe, tea, seasonal fruit juices, etc. The room was comfy however it was small. They have free Wifi 24 hours. Also, on the lobby, there are two computers available for guests 24 hours.

It was nice and clean enough but my room, a single, was incredibly small - easily the smallest I've stayed in anywhere in Europe or the US (including New York). There was a double-sized bed with about 1 or 2 feet of space around it, a little more at the foot, and that's it. There was a desk, but not enough room for a chair, and a little too far away from the bed to sit on the bed and use it. The air conditioning was pretty weak but not bad. I did not like that the air conditioning would shut off when I wasn't in the room - that meant every day when I got back after being out in the heat the room was hot and I had to wait an hour or so for it to cool back down. Other hotels with the key feature turn off the lights and so on but leave the A/C on. (It would even be okay if it stayed on but at a higher temperature.) The bathroom was fine - wish it had more counter space but it was acceptable. Everything was in working order and space wasn't an issue in there. Breakfast - can't remember if it was included or if I paid for it - was pretty good. The eggs were not very good at all but everything else was excellent. If I paid for it I can't remember how much so I can't say if it was worth it, but on another trip I spent 7 euros just for coffee and pastries, so I'd say anything in the 10-15 euro range would be perfectly acceptable. Staff was generally good. Stayed in a room facing the back alley, so not much of a view (in fact, kept window blinds closed because easy view into my room) but on the other hand, there was practically no noise even in the busy location. The only exception was at 6 or 7 am when I could hear whistle blowing (you know the kind down the Rambla) that woke me up. But heck it was time to get up anyhow. Internet connection was good, pretty standard for the area. If you don't mind the small rooms and don't need the room to be very cool (I do, it's personal taste I guess), then I'd recommend this hotel.

The hotel is central to everything and is in ideal location. We booked a triple room for 90 Euros per night, which is an excellent deal. The room is well furnished, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was well laid out. We left our luggage at the hotel and went for a walk thru La Rambla, this mile-long avenue is divided into five distinct sections. It's a stage set of human statues, jugglers, kiosks, birds, cafes, and beautiful flower stalls. We stopped at the Pla\u00e7a Reial, which is one of the city's old squares, with neoclassical pillars and archways, 19th-century lampposts and aging palm trees. Then we went for a walk at Barri G\u00f2tic, said to be the largest inhabited medieval quarter in Europe. We visited the Cathedral; this place of worship has seen many changes over the centuries, though it was thankfully one of the few to be spared the destruction of the Spanish Civil War. There was a mass service underway when we visited which was a very nice experience. We went back to the hotel for a break, took a nap for couple of hours and then made our way out for dinner at \u201cLoja de Tapas\u201d located at Pla Del Palau 7 which was an excellent choice for Tapas and I recommend it. The following morning I went out for an early morning jog which is a tradition I have whenever I arrive in a new city, then went back to the hotel to have breakfast with my wife and daughter at the hotel. Breakfast was excellent at the hotel and was reasonably priced. This day was intended to be a shopping day for most of the morning, so we started our strolled northwards along Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia. This avenue is both urban and cosmopolitan. Lined with elegant buildings, trendy shops, and wonderful eating spots, it starts from Plaza Catalu\u00f1a through the heart of Eixample, ending at the district of Gr\u00e0cia. Shopping was good for the whole family and we were all content with our purchases. We had sandwiches for lunch and then continued northward towards Casa Mil\u00e0; this is one of Gaud\u00ed\u2019s masterpieces and it is really a block of apartments, the most original in the entire city, and a high point of our visit. We went on a tour of the building and were so impressed by the brilliance of Gaudi. We then took a Taxi to La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia; We were at awe when we came out of the taxi and looked up towards this unearthly structure. This is Antoni Gaud\u00ed most revered masterpiece. The four original spires, which were created by the Master himself, are generally acknowledged to be far superior to the additional quartet. This is one of the most unique building I have ever seen and you must visit it if you go to Barcelona. Current construction progresses very slowly and you can see the artist and workers in action inside the cathedral. The most optimistic forecasters don\u2019t believe the whole project will reach completion for at least another 40 years. The next day we spent the morning at the Museu Picasso (\u20ac9 per person) and what a wonderful place to visit. I had no idea how diverse Picasso\u2019s style was until I visited the museum. There are more than 3,800 work of art arttribute to the master at this museum. Lunch was at a nearby small Italian restaurant \u201cCAPUTXES\u201d, 4 Davant De Sta. M. del Mar. They serve the best Italian food I have had in a long time and the staff was so nice and welcoming. Try to go there if you get a chance and you will not be disappointed. Our final stop was at Parc G\u00fcell, which is another of Gaudi\u2019s masterpieces, is unlike any other park in the world.

On the return leg, a flight to Edinburgh with the same airline due to depart 13.35 was scheduled to leave at 20:00. Avoid them! Check-in was fine with a little gift of some biscuits on arrival in the room. The room (210) was the smallest I have ever stayed in. Looking at the floor plan on the emergency exit I think I was unlucky as it looked the smallest on floor 2. Try to avoid this room if you can. Really not room to swing a cat! It was very clean and well fitted out. Not worth140 euros per night B&B. Breakfast was good with a wide selection of cereals, cakes and pastries, cheeses and meats, little sandwiches, juices etc. The cooked selection was average but you might be a little unhappy if you like your british fry up. Disappointing bangers which were more like hot dog sausages and the bacon was really more like the waffer ham you get at the supermarket. There is free wi-fi in all the rooms and if you don't take your laptop there are also two PCs with internet access which can be used for FREE. Only one was working during my stay so you often had to wait or come back. In the afternoon the hotel served FREE sandwiches and cakes/pastries in the lounge area. Also served was coffee/tea and if you wanted it Cava. A really nice touch. The hotel staff were helpful and curteous. Check-out was a bit drawn out as the sole receptionist was keener on answering the telephone than dealing with the queue of departing guests and took about 20 minutes. If you are paying with a Credit Card beware of how they charge you. I was charged in \u00a3 sterling with a 2% surcharge for conversion rather than in euros when my card issuer would not have charged this. They are supposed to ask you if you want to pay in euros and sterling so if you have a card which doesn't charge a foreign currency fee (eg Nationwide) make sure you pay in euros.

If you arent foot shy then you'll get more of a feel for the place by exploring on foot - we walked miles - although the metro is handy too. Finally, some recommendations for dining out at night - \"Ginger\" wine and tapas bar was truly excellent for authentic and novel tapas. Located between Carrer Palma de Sant Just and Carrer Lledo - its a bit hidden away but definitely worth the search. Also worth checking out is \"origen 99.9%\" on Passeig del Born.

We visited two friends in different hotels and they both had a bit better value for their money. As well service in the breakfast room was very nasty and arrogant. Even for Europeans like us we believe they should treat guests nicer in breakfast room. The first day we were not offered tea nor coffee. But the reception desk was very nice and helpful and as were the service people in general. All in all iI believe the hotel to be bit overpriced.

Les Quinze Nits is a fantastic restaurant with extremely reasonable prices; it's just off the Ramblas on Placa Reial, but get there early as they don't book tables and there's always a massive queue (open at 8pm on an evening). If you can't get in there, try La Fonda on calle Escudellers - it's run by the same people. Breakfast in the hotel was good - there was a large range of options to please everyone (sliced meats & cheese, pastries, full English, fruit & yoghurt, cereals etc). The free drinks and snacks on the first floor were a nice touch too, and the internet access was handy. The complimentary glass of Cava on arrival was nice too! Overall, this was fine as a base of operations for sight-seeing, but I am sure there are more romantic places to stay in this beautiful, if bustling, city.

It was somewhat bitter for us because we had a huge room in Madrid for a third cheaper in price per night, but we dealt with it. The space in room 308 is so tiny that only one person can walk around the double bed at any time without throwing the other person onto the bed! (I felt like we were in a ship cabin.) So if you're considering staying here, do not ask for rooms ending in 8 or 9 (which are the smallest rooms in the hotel, according to their detailed emergency exit floor plan). The breakfast: This was the second highlight of the hotel, after the location. It was a great spread filled with a variety of sliced fruits, hot dishes, cold cuts, cheeses, and pastries. I really didn't expect anything like this in ANY hotel, quite frankly! The dining room was also quite nice, with views out onto the plaza. To sum up, getting that tiny room was a toss-up upon check-in. We could have later complained and asked for a larger room if any were available, but chose not to.

I asked for a room overlooking the Placa Catalunya and was given Room 214 - which was perfect. Although the rooms aren't large, it was adequate for our needs and was perfectly clean.

Tourists meandered up and down the Rambla while others sat outside the many bars and cafes enjoying a drink or more with friends and family! It was a lovely holiday and the location of this hotel played a large part in making it so enjoyable! The only disappointment we found was the breakfast. There was a large choice of cakes, pastries, yoghurts, fruit as well as sausages and eggs etc. However, the eggs and sausages were almost cold on our first morning and the fresh pineapple had been out so long that it had started to go black. A little more attention to these minor points would have made it just perfect! Although this has no bearing on this hotel, a word of warning to prospective tourists to Barcelona. We saw a young girl below our balcony having her bag stolen early one morning. Although there is a larger police presence this year than I saw on previous visits, I believe the problem is getting worse and although it has been said many times before, please take extra care with your valuables and keep them with you at all times!
