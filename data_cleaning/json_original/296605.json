The place looked cleaner than I was expecting - no noticable body-fluid stains on the carpet or walls, and the bedding, towels looked OK.. Certainly not luxurious in any way, and lacked hotel basics like TV. The infamous stairs are a daunting sight and not for travellers with much luggage. There were some 80 year-olds staying at same time as me and they managed to the make it to the top floor OK so stairs look worse than they are. The place is very noisy - sounds of other guests were disturbing, and the church bells seemed to ring every 30 minutes 24x7. Bring ear-plugs and you'll be OK. I didn't have any... Although the place *looks* clean, I woke up scratching and left with multiple insect bites. Bed bugs or some other nasties I guess. The staff were friendly enough.

My friend who booked it got us a good deal on the hotel which didn't cost the earth. We found the hotel to be slightly basic but very clean and comfortable (beds fine with plenty of running hot water for the showers), basically what we were looking for as a base and place to crash at night. Only 2 of us made it up for breakfast one of the days which I understand wasn't up to much (bread and jam) but the excellent Sara's Pancake house was next door and Jennifer's Croissanterie across the road also so we didn't starve! The location of the hotel was ideal, less than 10 minutes walk to Dam Square and 2 mins from the Anne Frank Museum and canal cruise stops. The hotel is on quite a busy thoroughfare, our room was quite warm so we kept the window open at night and were woken by the trams which seemed to start at 5 am and church bells which went on the half hour! We were on the top floor, as other reviewers have said the stairs are a nightmare, the 1st staircase which greets you at the front door which takes you to reception is quite an imposing site!

The double bed mentioned on hotels.ca was actually two cots with more than half the springs completely missing or broken. The thin mattress was touching the floor and it was dirty. The sheets were dirty, and they had a few large holes. We tried to save a few bucks after a long trip, but I would have rather slept on a park bench in the rain than stay there. We asked reception for a refund, they refused. We asked to speak to the manager or owner, they refused (although we discovered later the guy who was refusing was either the owner or manager). Eventually after piles of emails and calls to hotels.ca we got a full refund for all three nights since the hotels description was not accurate at all. We had to send them pictures.

We were on the top floor and did have to climb all the spiral stairs to the top with luggage but had anticipated this already. It's a canal house afterall so it did make it a bit charming. One of the front desk men was nice, the other a little suspicious. The carpet was absolutely the dirtiest I have ever seen. Stains everywhere, no telling from what exactly. I'm not a picky person generally, a clean room with a bed and a warm shower (which we did have) is usually all it takes to satisfy me and it was almost obtained - but it just wasn't clean. Yes, the staff came in and changed the bed linens and put new towels in the bath and took out the trash, but the mattresses were stained and again, the carpet filthy. The towels didn't smell fresh and the blankets on the bed were never washed - I don't mean while we were staying there but I think quite possibly EVER. I wished we would have spent more money for a cleaner room I'm sorry to say. We did not indulge in the breakfast, but Sara's Pancakes next door was the best thing about this hotel! The location in general was great just wouldn't ever do it again. This was my least favorite hotel in all of Europe. I felt like I needed a shower after the shower, I actually wore flip flops in it.

The room was a decent enough size with a good shower but the carpet was littered with dubious-looking stains and the bedsheets didnt fit too well. I had the misfortune of sharing the double bed with a mate and the bed was pretty small it must be said, although it wasn't uncomfortable. We didnt sample the inclusive breakfast as we woke up rather late, but we did notice a nasty whiff at the foot of the stairs by the entrance door. In summary, the hotel is pretty grubby and not for those who are after luxury or even budget chain hotel standards.

To say I was concerned about our stay after the last review is an understatement but it was booked and off we went. I booked a quadruple room and a single room. My four travel companions shared the quadruple room. It was a little like a school dormitory and it was a bit of a squeeze but as we spent little time at the hotel other than when sleeping and for a short while late afternoon/early evening to get ready for a night on the tiles, it was fine. The single room was compact and a little lacking in furniture but again, it was adequate for the amount of time spent at the hotel. The bedside cabinet was broken but I worked out the knack to open the drawer without the whole thing falling apart pretty easily. Take your own towel because the towels are old and I don't think fabric conditioner has ever been used on them! It may also be an idea to take an extra pillow. The quadruple room had it's own shower, I used a shared shower for the floor but never had to wait for it to be available. The hotel seems to be joined to another one and that allows at least an extra wc on each floor! Of course, it has to be mentioned that the stairs are quite a feat! I certainly felt fitter by the end of our 3 day stay! There aren't TVs in the rooms but it's Amsterdam - get out and do something, there's a million things to do! There was a phone, I don't know if it worked. Breakfast was included in our price but we didn't take it up at any point. It looked like fairly basic stuff so we headed down to Sara's Pancakes which was on the row of shops below the hotel - it's fantastic! Throughly recommend it. It's not the best hotel in Amsterdam but for the price you pay (we paid c. \u00c2\u00a380 for 3 nights) then what can you expect? It was clean enough and the location can't be faulted.
