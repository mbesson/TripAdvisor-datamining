We have been to Playa many times but this was our first time at Illusion. Overall, we were very happy with Illusion. We had booked a standard room, but then the hotel staff sent us an email offering an upgrade to a Prestige room so we took the bait. We were both very happy that we did! The room was on the 4th floor. It was large and comfortable, with a king size bed, futon, fridge, microwave, and especially nice (and rare in MX), a coffeemaker in the room. The bathroom was very large, and the shower had plenty of hot water and really nice water pressure. My only complaint about the room was the lack of space to store clothing. There is a small area in the bathroom, but a chest of drawers in the living area would have been nice. We had to put our suitcase on the futon, and work out of them. This rendered the futon useless. OH well. No biggie. The views from the 4th flr rooms are fantastic! It was also nice to have the dipping pool and sundeck right at our disposal. My companion felt that the pool could have benefited from a chlorine treatment. He felt that it was a bit slimy, and that the shock treatment would have helped. The staff at the hotel was great. Check in and check out were a breeze. The staff was always helpful and friendly. Two individuals in particular stood out: Pablo at the front desk, who was helpful and accommodating with any request or issue that we had. And Abigail on the housekeeping staff was very sweet and very thorough, and her daily towel art was always something to look forward to. We had one breakfast at Illusion, but did not care for it. It is served in a cramped little room, and just was not very tasty. Instead we went to the Mosquito Beach buffet (just walk down to the beach and it's on your left). Although is was a little pricey (180 pesos), it was fabulous, with lot's of unusual choices of different foods, refreshing fruit waters, and a beachfront setting. We didn't utilize the beach club with whom the hotel has an arrangement, as we felt it was a little to pretentious for our tastes. Instead we walked the 1/2 block to the beach and turned right - walked 20 yards to the yellow chairs and spent our days there. Two chairs and an umbrella are 100 pesos, and they offer full beverage and food service. Quick, easy and cheap. All in all this was a really nice stay, and we will definitely be back. You really cant go wrong with Illusion, the location is perfect and the hotel strives to be the best that it can be.

We flew into Cancun, took the ADO bus into town and only had to walk 4 blocks to the hotel. If you want to lay in the sun the 4th floor is great for that. The pool is small and cold, no one uses it. Plan on going to the beach, it is very close. The beach is huge and great for playing in the water. The hotel will give you tickets to a club on the beach for use of the lounger chairs for the day. The place just asks that you buy around $10 US from them worth of food during the day. We actually only did this once as we would just go to the beach to play and the 4th floor of the hotel to lay out. Our only complaint about the hotel is that the bed was hard.

The roof-top terrace with its dipping pool is nice, note that this is correctly advertised as a dipping pool *not* a swimming pool, perfectly adequate if you prefer sea and surf. Breakfast is a simple cold buffet - cereals, toast, fruit, yoghurt, juice, coffee/tea - handy if you want to get out and about quickly. There is a diving centre next door, and the hotel gives you towels and vouchers for the many beach clubs, where you don't need to hire sunbeds/parasols provided you buy drinks etc. The hotel provides free spring water on each of the three floors and occasionally coffee in the lobby. It is hard to think of anything to complain about - if I had to pick something it would be the frequent running out of free coffee just when it was needed, no big deal at all.

Walmart is a quick 4-block walk if you want to get any snacks. As for our room, it was simple, yet modern. There weren't any bells and whistles, but the room had A/C, satellite TV, minibar, room safe, hair dryer, and iron; all the necessities, but no frills. We heard absolutely no noise from 5th Ave at night, so there weren't any problems there. The best part for me was that everything was CLEAN (and by clean I mean spotless!). The housekeeping staff at Illusion is amazing - they put any American hotel that I've ever stayed in to shame! Everyone always offered a smile and they really take pride in their work. I found the hotel to be exactly what I was looking for too. Definitely \"beachy\" with white washed walls, Mayan artistic accents, and lots of flowers! Be forewarned that the pool is small and very shallow (2ft), but perfect for a quick dip to cool off or socialize. They also have loungers by the pool in case you don't want to walk over to the beach. Wi-Fi is free and worked in our room without a problem. The front desk staff was always very courteous and willing to help, but we were pretty independent and did not require any of their services so I can't comment on booking excursions through them. As for breakfast, I know a lot of people were disappointed, but I really didn't mind it. Every morning we had pan tostado and assorted Mexican bakery items, plus coffee and fresh orange juice. Again, it was simple, but it held me over so that I could pig out on lunch and dinner later! Overall, I was very, very satisfied with Illusion and would definitely come back if I ever visit Playa del Carmen again! This is the perfect hotel for the low-maintenance traveler, with just the right touches to make you comfortable!", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Melbourne, Australia", "Title": "\u201cGreat location and helpful friendly staff cant wait to go back next year\u201d", "Author": "LeanneClyde", "ReviewID": "UR112972292", "Content": "Stayed on level 3 (rooms start with 4) which has the sun bed outdoor area and wading pool to cool off.

I will say, the pictures may be a bit deceiving in that it looks like some were taken for a wedding...this is not a 5 star hotel.

My wife and I do not intend to spend much time in our hotel or our room...we are there to see the city...and thus aim to find the best value. bottom line...in response to a negative review we saw...you don't get the Ritz for $100 a night. Positives: The normal evening front desk guy was GREAT...very friendly, always chit chatted with us when we left or came in and when we ran into him at the beach club. Gave some helpful advice along the way and all in all, made our stay more pleasant. Unfortunately I don't remember his name, but he is of some form of Spanish descent with a west coast accent. The cleaning crew did a good job of keeping the place clean. King size bed (in the value category...not always easy to come by) Nice shower (which is used often near a beach) Location was INCREDIBLE!!!! Some may like a location further north, but I felt we were steps from the nicest beaches and the 5th ave shopping district. There's a great store with anything you may need right around the corner. Right next to one of the better beach clubs in Playa...Wicky's....I had Exal hos my wife and I every day...very hard working man with a great attitude and a friendly spirit. Downsides: Small breakfast The common areas except for the check in area are very HOT!!!!! Some days I felt like I went from a comfortable room, walked through a hot common area, back to a comfortable reception area and outside...but I was already sweating from my short walk through the common area.

We didn't hear any noise from our room. We stayed in a luxury ocean view room, which was clean, spacious and had sliding doors to the roof terrace and 'pool' area. Al and Isidro at reception were extremely friendly and eager to offer discount vouchers to local restaurants. We had some lovely meals at El Bistro, Pancho's backyard and Karen's is great for authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price. You can get an amazing range of margaritas at Wet Wendy's; we had a frozen margarita which was so massive it took us all night to get through! The Illusion gives you daily passes to the beach in front of Wickys, but you have to spend 100 pesos each on food or drink there, which is easy to do. Their burgers are legendary! They give you a choice of sunbed or parasol, which I thought was a bit weird, and if you want both you have to pay an extra 50 pesos. I dived with Dive Mikes next door and they were brilliant. If you are a diver you just have to dive in the Cenotes, they are out of this world. Make sure you take plenty of mosquito spray though as you will get eaten alive at the jungle cenotes.The ocean diving off Playa is pretty barren, so head to Cozumel where it's simply glorious. Our only complaint during our stay was the hotel arranged a trip to Chitzen Itza. I was told that it would in a minibus with a maximum of 12 people. We were indeed picked up (an hour late) by a minibus, but it took us to the outskirts of town where we were transferred to a coach, packed with 50 other people. Chitzen Itza was fabulous but the coach trip was a nightmare! It adds a couple of hours to the journey whilst you pick people up and drop them off to just about every hotel in the town. The only down side to this hotel is the breakfast. It is just a luke warm piece of toast, a miniture sweet pastry and jam, with tea or coffee. We asked if we could pay to upgrade to the American breakfast but they wouldn't let us. In the greater scheme of things this is a minor point, and you can easily get a decent meal elsewhere. We stayed 7 nights here and then went on to Cozumel for a week. We really wished we'd stayed in Playa longer.

The hotel is clean, some of the rooms are a little small, but we upgraded to the top floor after hearing of some availabilities. I'd recommend getting a top floor room, as you have the sun deck and dipping pool right outside. The only down side to it is that you share this area with other guests, so there can be quite a bit of foot traffic. The pool is defintely just a dipping pool, but it was nice to relax in after sunning at the beach. The deck closes at 8 or 9, so after that you can enjoy the table and chairs outside your room. The complimentary breakfast in their garden courtyard is simple, but good. You can add on some cooked items like eggs and such for a small fee. We knew we weren't going to be right on the beach, so wasn't picky about the view, but our window didn't open and had a covering over it, so the first room we had was pretty dark.

The pictures on their web site were exactly what everything looked like. We paid for and received the standard room with no up-grade and were as pleased as can be with the quality of the room. We were also able to look into some of the other higher category rooms and they looked great. The fourth floor walk out rooms onto the pool terrace looked nice if you wanted something a little more special.The view from the roof on both the fourth and fifth floors was fantastic. Our booking included free continental breakfast at the adjacent restaurant (Scandic) which was just the right thing to start the day. Coffee, fresh OJ and toast and a pastry. When I say toast, I should clarify it was some kind of homemade bread (kind of like french bread) with strawberry preserves. Very nice. You pick up the coupon for the included continental breakfast at the front desk each morning. The location of the Illusion really can't be beat. Half a block off the beach and perfect for using the bus or the colectivo for day trips outside of PDC. The hotel also included the use of one computer on the main floor, which I didn't expect. Always a nice bonus to have e-mail contact with the family easily available. Our room was always cleaned before noon it seemed, and she did a great job with fun towel art every day. Staff greeted us as we would pass through the lobby through the course of the day. There is a little mini- mart just to the left of the Illusion and a money exchange with good rates just to the right. Very convenient. The Illusion does stock a mini fridge in the room which we didn't take advantage of as I didn't know the prices but it would be nice for some people. Also used the included safe in the room with no problems. One minor inconvenience (which worked out fine anyway) was that we only had one key to the room to share and also on that key ring is the key to the electricity so if I wanted to get up early and go for a walk I couldn't take a key with me as then my sister would not have electricity to get up and get ready while I'm out walking. The key for electricity was a new feature for me but it makes sense and really was only a minor inconvenience. Beach chairs were readily available on the beach for approx. 100-150 pesos for 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella. I look forward to spending my next vacation at the Illusion with my husband.

From the reviews and prices I was quoted, IBH seemed to fit the bill. $66 a night and a half block off of both 5th Avenue and the beach. Then I saw the emails about being bumped. So, I sent the third email to Gustav (I originally emailed to confirm they honor a GTA reservation, then confirming my paid reservation) to confirm for the second time that we had two rooms reserved. He replied as well as attached the confirmation on IBH stationary. We arrived to check in and as soon as the clerk said \"just one moment\" and left, I knew we were in trouble. Out comes Gustav to tell me that we only had one room and I would have to go to another hotel because my room was not vacated. When I starting pushing him and asking him why he would allow such a thing, he got very flustered and basically said there was nothing he could do. When I offered to take care of it myself, he blanched! I also told him about TA and what I have seen on it. Realizing I was at an impasse, I told him we would take the one room and I would wait for mine. That was acceptable. We were assigned a room on the second floor. One window facing the courtyard. Simple and clean. We messed around getting organized then decided to go have a cocktail (a recurring theme). I noticed on my way out an open door. When I looked in it was a empty clean room. As I looked further, just on the second floor mind you, there were two more clean empty rooms! So I marched down the desk, demanding to know why I hadn't gotten a room, and low and behold, here is a key and your room! Got my bags and moved in, another basic room, with a window overlooking some roof lines. We then proceeded to the roof deck where we met a group of folks who had the same exact experience. When they said they wouldn't move, they got a room... Needless to say, not a good start. Not a deal breaker though. The deal breaker was that evening about 11pm when a group of rather inebriated guests came home, were laughing, drinking, talking loudly and the whole courtyard basically reverberated with it. The fit and finsh around the doors is so poor that you see light in all directions. They are flimsy and whenever someone closes their door, it slams. Between the bed being as hard as a rock, hearing people and doors slamming, it was a tough sell for a good nights sleep. This continued to happen and finally on the third night, as I listened to a group who were sitting in the courtyard and being served by the resturant (oh ya, the clanking of dishes and glassware can be heard too), I called the front desk and complained. And I take something to sleep! I do know and accept that there are people who have stayed here and really had a good experience. I was not one of them. And it was all about the noise.

Some rooms overlook the streets, others the central courtyard. On the 5th floor you get ocean view, as you do from one of the rooms on the 4th. The rest on the 4th have ample french windows right onto the terrace, which can limit your privacy inside if there are people hanging out there. My room was on the 4th floor, but in a corner. It was large with a king size bed, 29\" TV, closet, minibar and coffee making equipment and supplies. I was protected from pool and deck users, which was good, but I had no view at all. The windows overlook a tube-like hole down to the first floor. As it was the top room there I could get natural light from the top opening of the hole. Probably similarly-located rooms on lower floors can get a bit dark. The drawback was you get noises from elevator equipment and water tank pump every time they are used, which at night can be a bit of a nuisance. Breakfast at \"Scandic\" restaurant next door -from same owners- leaves a lot to be desired.

Once we were checked in, we took our luggage to the room, found it hot, with no AC running. We went back to the front desk to ask about the air conditioning as well as parking for our car. We were told that we had to be in the room and use the key for the AC to work and \"sometimes it takes a couple of hours to cool down\". The clerk at the front desk tried to be accommodating, but the best he could ofer on parking was, to drive around and \"find a place on the street\" We went to our car and attempted to drive through the town to find a parking place. After an hour of very frustrating driving, we returned to the hotel, and told the desk clerk that there was no place to be found. He then said that there were some parking lots to pay for in town. We went up to the room and discussed the situation. My companion and I decided that this was not going to work for us, since I am somewhat handicapped and cannot walk long distances, and went back to the desk. We told the clerk that we would not be using the room, and returned our key. We asked how we would get our payment refunded since we had paid for the entire week, and he told us that it should not be a problem, but he could not do it, we would have to contact the hotel manager later in the week for the refund. We thanked him, and left the location I had originally purchased this through HSI and contacted them that eveining to let them know that the accommodations were unsuccessful. The contact was not returned in a prompt manner, but finally I was told that HSI had paid Illusions and I needed to get the refund from them.

It was well worth the money and we would definitely stay there again, and likely will if/when we return to Playa. Here are the pros and cons as we see them. Pros: 1. Cleanliness. The housekeeping staff was constantly cleaning, and we didn't see one bug the entire time we were there. They even cleaned the hair out of my wife's hairbrush - that's how thorough they are. Sand that we tracked in from the beach was gone the next day, the shower and bathroom were immaculate, and the bed was comfortable and big. 2. Service. The last hotel we stayed at prior to Illusion was a Four Seasons, and my wife and I commented a number of times that the service at Illusion was like a 3-star version of the Four Seasons. There aren't any of the five-star frills, but the staff was extremely nice and accommodating whenever we asked for anything. 3. Location. Illusion is less than a block from the amazing beach, and is right in the middle of downtown. I'd rather stay in this location in a very clean hotel than in an all-inclusive 10 miles away from the action. The location was perfect. 4. Restaurant. Though I don't think it's owned by the hotel, the restaurant adjacent to it was very good. All we ate there was breakfast, but the crepes and omelettes were first-rate. Cons: All things considered, these are very minor negatives, but they are negatives nonetheless. 1. Though it's very close to the beach, it's not ON the beach, and as such there aren't chairs and tables and those things that a couple other hotels have. However, you can easily go to those hotels and restaurants that do have seating on the beach - we spent many days at Fusion's restaurant/bar just a block or two away, and just sitting on the beach on towels. 2. The pool is not really a pool that one would swim in. It's very cold (in December at least) and very small. Sitting by the pool in chairs is all we used it for, but with a warm and swimmable ocean a block away, it wasn't an issue. 3. No fitness center. If you're looking for a workout, a morning run on the beach is your best bet. Overall, Illusion was a great hotel. Considering that the last vacation my wife and I took was a honeymoon with nothing but 5-star hotels, we expected to be disappointed by a relatively inexpensive hotel in Playa. We were not, however, disappointed at all. It's not a five-star hotel, so the bed - while comfortable - isn't top-of-the-line, the service is great but not omnipresent, and the TV isn't a high-tech plasma, but for this price range I don't think we possibly could have done better. Given the out-of-town location of most of the four- and five-star hotels in Playa, I honestly think we'd choose Illusion even if price were not part of the consideration.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kansas city", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay at Illusion\u201d", "Author": "flyboy6554", "ReviewID": "UR51403707", "Content": "Found this hotel through Worldlink Travel......a great deal, especially for the price.

The rooms were basically one large room with a bathroom (toilet and shower private with door, sink and vanity in room). There is a little balcony off the room, just enough room for two chairs. There is free internet access on one computer next to the lobby. It is right next door to a tiny 'convenience' store (cash only). Overall, the hotel was very nice and I would stay there again. If you keep in mind that it is a hotel, not a resort, then your expectations should be met. The staff was friendly and helpful. When we got our room, I noticed that the balcony door didn't latch properly. I informed the front desk and they apologized and gave us a new room without any hesitation, charge, or complaint. Both rooms were clean, the in-room safe and mini-fridge was nice to have. (You'll save $ if you just walk out the front door to buy drinks/snacks at the store rather than the ones offered in the room.) It is nice that it is close to 5th yet inside the room is quite. Finding the hotel if you're driving or taking the bus: You can't drive up to the door so you'll want to park as close to 8th as you can. They don't have their own parking area, so find one on the side streets. The bus station is not far from the hotel either, so just head down the pedestrian only street.

From the moment we walked in the front door my girlfriend and I were greeted with incredible graciousness. Its the first time I was ever met at the door by a hotel manager (and as an airline pilot I have been to many hotels in my time) that took the time to welcome us to the hotel, enquire on how he and the staff may further meet any and needs or concerns and actually gave us our choice of rooms. Silvia and Violetta were wonderfully pleasant and knowledgeable and became a friendly smile behind the counter that you could goto for anything from towels to tourist info. Hotel Illusion Boutique (IBH) is located right in the pedestrian area of Playa Del Carmen (PDC) which it turns out was really an ideal location. Less than a half block to the beach front and surrounded by the heart of the PDC night life everything is in complete walking distance. We had friends staying in a very lavish 5 star resort 20 minutes north of PDC for a wedding and my girlfriend and I both resoundingly agree that our experience of PDC and our stay at IBH was far more enjoyable. The roof top pool and patio has a breath taking view of the beach and at night the city lights of island of Cozumel dance to the music of the local clubs not far below. Incidentally much of the beach front of PDC is furnished with cabanas and bars belonging to various establishments of which as guest members of the hotel you are entitled to free beach lounge chair and towel service at one of the beach bars (it was a nice touch, I thought) Finally as an side note I would be remiss if I did not comment on the state of the Swine Flu and its impact on our vacation. My girlfriend and I both had many reservations initially before traveling to Mexico. As I mentioned it was for the purpose of both a vacation and to attend a wedding of a very good friend. I can tell you from the experiences of myself, my girlfriend and those of the wedding party we are very, VERY happy we went. We decided almost not to go as a result of all the media attention Swine Flu was receiving. My girlfriend works in a hospital, myself at an airline, we consider ourselves to be reasonably intelligent and informed both from our professions and from a personal sense of accountability. Sadly buying into the half truths and hysteria of the media almost cancelled an otherwise perfect trip. I'm glad it didn't. I can only urge those contemplating a vacation in Mexico to do the research the facts and make a decision based on the full facts not the half truths that sell newspapers. I encourage you to visit websites like the WHO and CDC and look at the statistics that clearly show a higher seasonal mortality rate for the common flu, in Ontario, Canada alone, never mind nationally or globally than can be attributed to Swine Flu. Finally I encourage that armed with that knowledge still take precautions: get your flu shot, wash your hands often (and keep them away from your face), take a mask if it makes you feel better and buy some antibacterial hand spray. This should be pretty much standard practice at home or abroad regardless, but thats my opinion. If you decide to goto Mexico (which I strongly recommend, and even more so stay at the Illusion Boutique Hotel) go there knowing its SAFE, all the amenities were CLEAN and very friendly. Mexico and the Mayan Riveria is still an incredible travel destination that won't disappoint. I'd like to thank Jamie, Silva and Violetta especially and the rest of the IBH staff for their excellent service and making our stay in PDC one of the most memorable trips I've ever had.

The luxury suite had a king size bed, futon couch, tv, and kitchenette which included a small sink, microwave and refrigerator. The refrigerator was stocked with items to be purchased from the hotel but we were able to fit a 6 pack of beer and water on the door without any trouble. The a/c will only work if the door is closed and the room key is required to turn it on . It only took a few minutes for the room to cool down once we returned from our journeys. We usually took a dip in the pool while we waited for the room to chill. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. We had a problem with these teeny-tiny ants in our bathroom our last day staying there. I informed the front desk and they immediately came to our room to assess the problem. The front desk girl offered to move us to another room. Since it was our last night we didn't want to go to the trouble to pack up all our things and relocate. I asked if they had any bug spray. She said yes and asked if we would mind if they sprayed the bathroom. I told them I didn't care and they left can of bug spray with us. On a side note, I didn't really mind the ants. The hotel is situated a half block from the beach in an old building in Mexico. A few pesky ants in the bathroom didn't spoil our experience. The hotel is in a great location, just off 5th Ave. Walk in either direction and you'll find great shopping, restaurants and bars. For being so close to the nightlife, it was surprisingly quiet. There is a convenience store right next to the hotel. Great for beer, water, wine, sunscreen, etc. There is a money exchange on the other side of the hotel. We found it had the best exchange rate in the area. We didn't eat at the restaurant - we usually ended up eating somewhere on 5th. The bar next to the pool is only open during the busy season (not sure when that is but not while we were there). Probably a good thing..saved us some money. We grabbed beers from next door and took them out to the pool with us.", "Date": "May 21, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Colorado", "Title": "\u201cGreat room, excellent service\u201d", "Author": "Sean_in_CO", "ReviewID": "UR29309388", "Content": "My girlfriend and I stayed at the Illusion from Apr 19th-22nd and had an absolutely wonderful time.

It was excellent on all levels with rare cause for concern. Located 1 block from 5th, we were close to shopping. 1 block the other way put you on the beach! 3 blocks south and you could catch the bus to go to see mayan ruins and more. So location wise this was by far the best option. The room service was perfect, we left $5 tips every night and received wonderful towel creations in the am. We used a massage service as well, Rafa was great for getting the stress out of your body after a long day travelling. I would stay here again, but not for 4 nights - we would only do 1 or 2 nights in Playa. This was nothing to to with the hotel, but the fact Playa was very very busy and has a lot of pushy in your face vendors. Akumal was nothing like that, having quieter, better beaches and best snorkelling ever right out your front door. the only negative?? we ran into was the somewhat poor sound proofing of this entire hotel. Rooms are absolutely beautiful, but sounds travel through lightly built doors very readily across the all stone floors and the design of rooms around a central open area. Some nights we were able to hear several other rooms, and noise from outside even. it wasn't excessive, and wouldn't deter us from staying here again. We declined the front desk's persuasive options for a time share meeting (welcome kit was their wording), and in hindsight we are happy about it. The days are short, and there is a lot of awesome stuff to see and do. For food, we had affordable breakfast every day at Dona Diablo next door, and our preferred choice of restaurant was Karen's a couple of blocks away on 5th - where the best calamari around was to be found and excellent pizza. Madre Tierra was our favourite high end restaurant for tuna steak and filet. AVOID Agua Luna restaurant that the front desk recommends, it was AWFUL - we ordered a mahi mahi tuna steak and got what i think was grouper, or maybe some other type of normal fish covered in pineapple. Ordered fries, never got them. Paid $15 per drink. Never saw the waiter again after food was dropped off at our table (couldn't even eat it it tasted so bad), and when we went to pay they forced a tip on us still.

Every day she was trying to push us into this event, to the point it was uncomfortable to pick up our key to go to our room. The other 2 hotels in the Yucatan we stayed at were totally wonderful and I think this contributed to not being relaxed at all during our stay in Playa. Also, the \"pool\" looks like a pool in the images, but be warned it is about 4 times the size of a bathtub and goes to your waist. The free cocktail was in fact a free can of beer. So there was some exaggeration in the promotion. Also, the beach section allocated to this hotel was in front of rocks and not good for swimming, whereas others were not. Just something to look into when trying to figure out where to stay. One lock on our door was broken - I didn't feel unsafe because it was loud and lots going on in the area, but if that's important to you, then that's another strike against this hotel.

The hotel was nice and quiet and close to the beach. The staff was very friendly and the front desk personnel often helped us with Spanish phrases. We stayed in the Luxury Suite. The bed was large (a king) and very firm (which I like), but not uncomfortably firm. The shower was large too. Definitely large enough for two people to shower at once. The air conditioner worked well too, which was much needed. They also have a very neat system with the room key so that you don't waste electricity and cool air. They also had a computer in the lobby area with free internet if you needed it. The only one down side to our stay with a strange interaction with the staff about the fully stocked fridge. Since there is a Walmart very near by and since we planned on buying water and other food stuff ourselves, we wanted to use the fridge to hold things in. The fridge came insanely stocked full. Too full to put any of our things in there. So we removed all the sodas, water, and mini liquor bottles from the fridge to make room for our things because we did not want to pay whatever price they were charging to drink their provided refreshments. So one day we got a call from the front desk stating that because we were keeping their items outside of the fridge, we were going to have to be charged a daily fee for using the fridge. \"Uh, what?\" Needless to say, I talked this over with the woman and told her that I would not be paying such a fee. The next day, they had put all of their items back into the fridge and removed our items. We just left our waters outside of the fridge and drank our waters room temperature from then on. Other than that, everything was fine. I'd say, \"We'd stay here again,\" but I doubt we'll return to Playa.

We asked for an upgrade, and they were very accommodating, putting us in a \"master suite,\" which had a full-size refrigerator, stove, and dining room table. Definitely worth the money, since one day was very rainy and we had to stay in the room most of the day. The upgrade didn't cost anymore than it would have to book it online. Addtionally, the location of this hotel couldn't be better. We were just steps from the beach and very close to the Blue Parrot. This hotel is right in the middle of the \"5th Avenue\" district, so we were within walking distance of all the action! The staff was all very helpful and friendly. One thing to be aware of is that the pics on the website are not really current anymore.

Miguel was the employee we had the most contact with, and he seemed to make it his goal to ensure that our vacation went perfectly. In fact, he personally went to a convenience store to get me some milk of magnesia when he saw how badly I was burned one day. One night there was construction going on in the middle of the night at the building next door to us and the staff immediately remedied the situation. They gave us a new room for the night and the next day offered to permanently switch our rooms in case the construction happened again. The cleanliness of the hotel was also excellent. The rooms were always well cleaned, and were a decent size as well considering that it is a fairly small hotel. One complaint I had about the rooms was that you needed to use your room key to use the electrical outlets in the room. So when you were not in the room there was no electricity, which meant that the air conditioning turns off as well. It was a little annoying always returning to a hot room, but the air conditioner worked wlell and cooled it off quickly. We spent quite a bit of time at the pool on the roof.

The continental breakfast was appreciated in the morning to get ourselves going for the day. As stated by others, the location is excellent, certainly staggering distance from most PDC bars. We did our share of staggering, too. Unfortunately while we were there it was low season so many of the facilities were not available like the roof top bar.

(5/2-5/6/08) Both of us have been to Playa Del Carmen a few times in the past but have stayed at the larger, crowded \"all-inclusive\" resorts. We booked the Illusion on the internet. We originally had a Deluxe Balcony room (a very nice room ) but as soon as we saw the Luxury rooms on the roof-top we asked to be upgraded. Javier, our favorite staff member, got right on it. Before we knew it, we were unpacking our bags and sitting by the pool drinking Margaritas. Our room was just lovely. A king canopy bed with shear drapes, mini bar, fridge, and microwave. Each morning, we awoke to a lovely ocean view. It should be noted that the hotel did not want to move us to this room at first because the air-conditioning was not working properly and they didn't want to inconvenience us. We told them air-conditioning wasn't important and that the view and location were spectacular. Although we didn't care about the air-conditioning, Javier made certain the air-conditioner was fixed by 2pm that day! That pretty much sums up the treament we received. No request ever was ignored. By the way, we never found the music or construction to be an issue, as was commented in previous reviews. The location of this hotel is unbeatable. A few steps to the right is the ocean. A few steps to the left, 5th Ave. A Dive shop, mini market and money exchange are adjacent to the Hotel. I love the fact that this is not an all-inclusive, as we wanted try a variety of restaurants and not eat the same 5 ingredients re-arranged at breakfast, lunch and dinner in 5 different \"themed\" dinning rooms, as most all-inclusive's offer. Our favorite, by far, was \"Babes\" about 2 blocks away. Great thai food and drinks. VERY reasonable. Sit on the street and watch the crowds stroll by. Here is the best Tip of All!!! When you arrive at the Cancun Airport, walk past all of the cabs and private shuttles. They want to charge$60-80.00 each way to Playa Del Carmen. Continue to walk down the side walk to the \"ADO\" buses at the very end. You can not miss them. They leave regulary (don't believe the Cab drivers that tell you the bus just left and it will be hours before the next one). These are luxury, air-conditioned buses that go directly to Playa. The cost is $ 8.00 dollars per person and the trip takes about 45-50 min. There are also ADO buses that go to Akumal, Tulum and other destinations. The bus station in Playa is right on 5th ave so it is an easy 4 block walk to the Hotel. I could go on and on about the Illusion Hotel but I'm running out of space. Take my advice and just go there for your self. One small neg is that it's more of a quiet romantic boutique hotel and would be boring for small children.

We (3 women late 20s/early 30s) stayed at the Illusion Boutique Hotel in April of 2008 and were in a Luxury Suite room with a king bed and a futon. The room had a king bed, futon, mini refrigerator, microwave, and sliders that opened up on to the rooftop patio area where the bar and the pool were; we loved this. The bar closed at 6 or 6:30, so there wasn\u2019t noise issue at night. Note that the pool is really more of a wading pool \u2013 it\u2019s about 2 \u00bd feet deep. Good for cooling off, but not for swimming. The pictures on the hotel website do a pretty good job of showing what the room looks like. The bed and futon were both very hard, but we were ok with that. As other reviewers have mentioned, by the end of the week, the bathroom did have a bit of a musty smell \u2013 probably from the wet bathing suits. There was no real closet in the room (there was hanging space in the bathroom), nor was there a good place to keep the suitcases. It did feel a bit crowded with 3 of us in there, but we didn\u2019t spend that much time in the room. The staff at the hotel was very friendly \u2013 Javier is great; make sure you get Byron to show you his dance moves. The other guests staying at the hotel were also very friendly; it was a fun atmosphere. Because it is a relatively small hotel, there is the opportunity to get to know the other guests. The hotel offers massages in little cabana rooms on top of the hotel. The massages were very good and affordable ($40 for 50 minutes; $10 off if you book one within a day of arriving). You could still hear the music from the bar and the construction noise in the cabana rooms, so that was a bit distracting. Breakfast left a little to be desired. Toast and mediocre pastries were free. It was $5 a person to \u201cupgrade\u201d to include fruit, cereal, and a made to order omelet. They used too much oil in the pan so the eggs were really greasy. Most days we would eat elsewhere. We found a great little bagel/coffee shop on 5th avenue. The location of this hotel can\u2019t be beat \u2013 it was steps to 5th avenue and to the beach, and there was a cheap internet caf\u00e9 across the street. 5th avenue is a pedestrian street filled with bars and restaurants and lots of shops. We could walk everywhere from Illusion. The beach was great \u2013 crystal clear warm water, soft sand, and wait staff bringing you tropical drinks (try the Kaluha Kolada!). It was $5 a day to rent a beach chair. One negative is that there was quite a bit of construction going on across the street. We couldn\u2019t hear it too much in the room, but it was annoying lying out on the rooftop deck by the pool. Some days they blasted music at the bar to try to cover it up, so it wasn\u2019t exactly quiet and relaxing, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re after.

Sometimes it was broiling, scalding hot, other times lukewarm, and you couldn't adjust the temperature -- the hot and cold knobs just turned the water on and off, and didn't even increase or decrease the flow, which maxed out at a slow dribble.

The hotel's General Manager treated us so well; each time we left or returned to our room, he greeted us with a smile and made sure we were happy and enjoying our stay. After my bank became concerned that someone had stolen my debit card and frozen our account, he offered to come pick up the tab if we were stranded at a restaurant again. There isn't a restaurant in the hotel, but they do offer a continental breakfast (included) or eggs made to order (not included) in the courtyard each morning. The two gentlemen operating the breakfast were also incredibly friendly. We stayed in a Luxury Suite and it was not huge, but perfectly adequate for our needs. One interesting thing about the rooms are the lights and air conditioning are operated by a key, meaning, you have to insert a key to power them up, and if the door is ajar or the key is removed, you lose power. We thought we would try to outsmart the system by removing the light key from the room keyring and leave it in the room at all times - try again...the keyring was welded closed. We asked for a second set of room keys (again, we thought we were so clever), and were told that if we ever needed to get into the room to just ask the front desk and they would let us in. This wasn't a huge deal, but it did mean that once you leave your room, unless you want to leave your room unlocked, the A/C wasn't cooling your room. Fortunately, the A/C units were excellent and our room was always cooled down within a matter of a few minutes. I can't say enough nice things about the staff at this hotel, in fact, our last night in Mexico, the staff held a private party for the owner of the hotel and invited us to join them, telling us we were \"family\". The hotel is located right in the heart of 5th Avenue - we simply walked out the door and were exactly where we needed to be. The ferry to Cozumel is also just a few blocks away, and we made the trip over on a number of occasions. There is also an internet cafe right across the street that charges $15 Pesos an hour for broadband, which was incredibly convenient and at about $1.50 an hour U.S., very reasonably priced. The dive shop right next to the hotel is also very reasonable, about $16 a person / per day for snorkeling gear.

Our first impression of the hotel was that the place was very clean, exceptionally well maintained, and with only 40 rooms, completely uncrowded. Our room was spotless, and equipped with everything we might need or want during our stay. Our first stop was to the rooftop pool and cabana bar. Javier quickly served up a couple cerveca's, and within minutes we were making new friends. Over the next few days, we met three great couples, from all different areas, and spent time together going out to dinner and just getting to know new people. Each morning we treated ourselves to a delicious omelet from the omelet bar, along with other goodies, great coffee, all while sitting in the open air courtyard...very relaxing! Our room, located rooftop pool level, was very convenient, and the area provides beautiful ocean views, plenty of chairs, umbrellas etc., for taking in a good book, and a quick jump in the pool to cool off from the hot afternoon sun. Not to mention, you are right there for the afternnoon cocktails served up poolside! Every night we were a minute's walk from fine restaurants, live entertainment, great stores, yet just off the main walk. My wife could shop during the day to her hearts content, and be back to the hotel within minutes to meet up for lunch, or travel off to our next destination. Hotel location was great! From beginning to end, we were well taken care of by all the staff and management, and have returned home to share our great experience with our other traveling friends.

In January it was very windy so that the beautiful roof terrace of which exclusivity is pretty unique in the area, was just perfect. The view is as perfect as it looks on the pics. Great chance to just listen the sound of the sea. The location is also perfect as it is 20ms from Avenida Quinta the main (and the only) shopping street. The prices of food in restaurants are pretty high, but there is a Wal-Mart with Mexican cuisine inside for a 10m walk straight from the hotel that is a good choice for not burning all the money for food. The evenings are sometimes noisy as the restaurant has an attrium and the doors and walls are pretty thin. That is sometimes annoying but I guess that is the only bad thing about the hotel. The members of staff - and the Mexicans in general - are very nice people.

We booked our room through Expedia and this was not made known to us at any time; we told him we certainly did not want to bring our children where they were not allowed nor wanted, but we had no idea! The room was paid in full and it was doubtful we could get a comparable room at another hotel at that time. I felt terrible about the situation and that we were imposing on them! Just that week I emailed the hotel to confirm the reservation and informed them that our family (including the young ones) were looking forward to spending my 40th birthday there- when I asked Miguel about it he quickly said they never received it. Instead of making the best of a bad situation, Miguel chooses to put us in a smaller room than we paid for based on the idea that a futon only fit into this particular room. When my husband went down to speak with him later that night to make sure everything was ok, Miguel offered to help us look around for another hotel the next day- just what we wanted to do on our 1st day in Mexico! In other words, he wanted us OUT! He even explained that they had gotten a bad review on tripadvisor- (see \"lies, lies, lies\") because children were there earlier. So, we were made to feel unwelcomed because someone else was angry that children were there in the past! Finally, we asked to be moved to the room we paid for with the balcony, ocean view and king size bed and showed them that a futon would fit in there without a problem (as the room actually is larger). Guess what, the futon fit perfectly and our family had more room. I wonder why Miguel didn't do this for us when we arrived - ? During our stay, we were almost never at the hotel because we did a lot of trips, so our children were not even physically present to bother anyone. (by the way, they were not the loud ones another reviewer referred to....) And the kids were so worn out at night they went straight to sleep. The bar hoppers coming in at night were even louder than our kids. Our kids have traveled quite a bit and stayed at much nicer hotels, so they understand the idea of respecting others. It was such a disappointment to stay at Illusions. We have never been treated so poorly by people who are supposedly in the business of making guests feel comfortable.

I enjoy sitting on a towel on the beach so that I can feel the soft sand underneath me so I didn't mind not having a beach chair. After sunbathing my husband and I would head back to the Illusion, sit outside on the patio overlooking the ocean, have a bite to eat, and enjoy a few afternoon cocktails. The place is very easy and laid back, altho very attentive when you need something. The staff is great. Chris and Dave are the best! We could not have asked for more. Playa del Carmen is a great town because it has so many great restaurants and little shops, but there's still a huge local flavor there which can be hard to find in the Carribean especially when your staying at an all-inclusive. oh, and by the way, we did the ATV tour thru the jungle. It was the best and you can drive fast!!! And one more thing, when you're there take a look at the promotional video...that's us sitting at the bar!!!", "Date": "March 15, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "5.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "Farmington Hills, MI", "Title": "\u201cGood Value, Location\u201d", "Author": "StewartsLucy", "ReviewID": "UR4587774", "Content": "My husband and I are just returning from a week stay at the Illusion Hotel (2/25/06-3/4/06). I work as a flight attendant for a major US airline for many years now, so we get around. We are in our early 40s if this helps. This hotel was very clean and the location is quite convenient. Just between the beach and 5th avenue. Noise was never a problem. There is a minimart right next door for picking up water or munchies, and a farmacia at the corner of 5th ave. and calle 8. We had room #204 which is one of the standard rooms here. There is free wireless internet throughout hotel. It worked very well for us in our room on the 2nd floor. If you don't want to bring your computer, there are 2 internet cafe's right outside the hotel with low rates. The plumbing worked very well! The shower is great, oversized, and the water pressure the strongest I've had in Mexico. We never ran out of hot water. And the toilets flush fine--you can even throw the TP in. For the gals out there, the in-room blow-dryer provided was powerful enough to blow-dry my long, thick, hair in record time. We had a remote control for the A/C, and there is also a ceiling fan. Some of the suggestions we made to hotel that would improve this particular room were; need a sheer curtain to allow light along with privacy. We only had a blackout curtain, and as this hotel is atrium style, we had to keep it pulled when sleeping, getting dressed, or showering. This made the room dark most of the time. We were told on check-out that this was already under consideration and may be coming. We noticed the 4th floor suites had sheer curtains. There is no closet in this room, nor space enough for the two of us to unpack. The luggage rack, hang space is not sufficient. The entire week I had to keep all of my clothes in my suitcase! They need a closet or some dressers pronto. We went through quite a few rainstorms the week we were there, and there was not a lot of room to hang-dry our wet clothes. There is a clothesline in the bathroom that is suitable for bathing suits. They also need a desk and or table in this room. there was no where to put items. There are 2 nightstands, a small decorative table. We needed a place to put our laptop, review travel books & maps. You do have a futon to sit on. I requested a sheet to throw over it and got it. The hotel does not participate with any of the beach clubs, so you will have to rent loungers if you want to stay on the beach--and who doesn't?? There is a roof-top pool (small) and loungers which we enjoyed, but we wouldn't spend the entire week up there. FYI there are beach clubs up and down the beach in Playa, with 2 right at the end of Calle 8. The roof-top bar also offers happy hour. The coffee served at the continental breakfast wasdelicious. You get a fresh squeezed glass of OJ and a basket of rolls. If you want more, it is available but you must pay for it. After the big dinners we had, the continental was plenty for us. The staff were friendly and accomadating. The maid service was good, again, the room was super clean. Special thanks to our server Christian for his hospitality, and Miguel for his assistance with our reservation. We booked the airport transfer through the hotel via STP Caribe. It cost $100 USD round-trip for a private van with A/C that worked out very well. We would recommend the Illusion. Enjoy your stay in beautiful Playa del Carmen!", "Date": "March 6, 2006"}], "HotelInfo": {"Name": "Illusion Boutique Hotel by Xperience Hotels", "HotelURL": "/ShowUserReviews-g150812-d530526-Reviews-Illusion_Boutique_Hotel_by_Xperience_Hotels-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html", "Price": "$83 - $174*", "Address": "<address> <span rel=\"v:address\"> <span dir=\"ltr\"><span class=\"street-address\" property=\"v:street-address\">Calle 8 Nte.</span> | <span class=\"extended-address\">Entre 5a Ave y ZFM Lote 10</span>, <span class=\"locality\"><span property=\"v:locality\">Playa del Carmen</span> <span property=\"v:postal-code\">77710</span></span>, <span class=\"country-name\" property=\"v:country-name\">Mexico</span> </span> </span> </address>", "HotelID": "530526", "ImgURL": "http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/ef/3e/51/alberca-con-vista-al.jpg"}}
