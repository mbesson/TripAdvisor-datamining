Room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Bathroom was big and good shower strength. Walls are definitely thin, can hear your neighbors and outside street noise. But I wore earplugs, so no problem.

We had the room with balcony on 5th floor. Quite spacious for the two of us. The room came with free wifi and the standard amenities. We found it convenient as it is along Las Ramblas street and nearby Metro station. Hard Rock was also walking distance. And there is also a tourist information counter along the Las Ramblas street. Just nxt to the hotel is a nice bar with good tapas called Bar Lobo and we ate there twice! The hotel receptionists are helpful in providing assistance on tourist information. The first night we arrived, they helped to make reservation for Flamingo dance show which is just 10 mins walk from the hotel. They also sell the hop on & off bus passes which we bought fr 2 days pass. We had the room facing the street so it can be noisy until 1-3am so we couldn't open the balcony glass door for the cool air as it was pretty noisy. We used the aircon instead. We are happy with the room condition and the services as we were only in the room during the night after a day out sight seeing. We managed to find a self service laundry just nearby street fr the hotel so we managed to get our clothes washed as we came from a week in Italy. The laundry is a bit hidden, got to walk almost end of the street to be noticed. Some tips on Barcelona : becareful with your belongings especially when taking out luggages from taxi/car...never leave it out of your sight as its common for snatch thieves to just walk along and carry your bags off!! While we were there, we experienced young tourists reporting stolen bags. Do visit Montserrat for a day tour. Lovely scenery and if one is adventures, can walk to a spot with a cross for good view. Walk take about an hour to go up & back. And make sure to buy online tickets to Sagrada Familia church as the queue is pretty long!! More than an hour to get in. If taking the metro, buy the 10 trip pass for \u20ac9.30 and can be used for few people. We bought a ticket and shared for 2 days.", "Date": "March 30, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Madrid, Spain", "Title": "\u201cAll-round OK\u201d", "Author": "BeenThere07", "ReviewID": "UR125411710", "Content": "Excellent location, simple rooms, contemporary design, great breakfast, WIFI.

When we travel anywhere I spend days on the web trying to find such hotels, so when we choose Barcelona after a very very long search I finally found Hotel Turin who agreed to take 2 adults and 3 kids under 12 in the same room. Firstly a big big WOW on the location. Its literally on the Ramblas but enough paces to cut down on some of its wonderful hustle and bustle and noise. You really couldn't do any better on location. Then you enter the hotel and its very modern, very clean and friendly. Basically a very welcome sight. The short corradoors to the rooms are very modern with the doors almost flush with the walls. Anyone sick of looking at endless corridors of oak architraves and oak doors will be refreshed. Once inside the room is very very cleverly laid out. Almost all the lighting is recessed and the pull down beds are very clever. Even the frosted sliding door into the loo is ultra modern and all about saving space. So, though the rooms are small, just like most Barcelona hotel rooms, you don't feel it at all - and that's saying something with two adults and three kids inside!! Flat screen TV, very responsive Air Con, in-room Safe, all go to bring this hotel beyond most 3 star city hotels. There's even a small communal decked roof terrace (safe and enclosed enough if you have kids with you) which lets you get a feel of urban living among the older surrounding buildings and apartments which overlook it. The car park is right next door, and if you simply pay in the hotel upon departure you get a decent discount and pay only \u20ac18 per day. And, to top it all off, not 10 paces from the front door of Hotel Turin are the first of all the wonderful things about Barcelona, pavement-side cafes and bars ready to serve you some of the finest coffees, beers and tapas while you watch the world go by, contemplating which next cafe you'll stop at. All things considered, value for money, cleanliness, rooms and of course location, you simply cant go wrong.

A big thank to all of you! It turned out to be a good choice! Fantastic Value As Barcelona is a world class conference destination, good accommodation does not come cheap, particularly near La Rambla . Hence Turin Hotel is a hidden gem considering its reasonable rates ( comparatively). While we agree that it is not a plush hotel with grand ballrooms and spa- it is a clean and modern hotel . Its bathrooms were fairly spacious and clean with a bathtub and a shower- you could not expect grand bathrooms in Europe, not in a 3 star hotel. It was definitely bigger than the bathrooms in our Paris and London hotels. The hotel has a small elevator which was big enough for our luggages. The internet was free but it might be limited to their computers at the lobby. The rates did not include breakfast but there are so many cafes nearby that you do not have to worry about getting your morning coffee. It was good enough for us. Great Location The hotel is located less than 5 minutes walk from La Rambla, in a quiet but safe street ( which was a great concern for us as we had read that La Rambla can be unsafe at times). Food: At the beginning of the street you would find Le Meridien hotel and a posh Chinese Restaurant ( with a lovely paper origami like giant dragon) . The small square next to the hotel has about 3 restaurants including one very classy one which seemed very popular with the locals. One night we had a night drink at the square and watched very good acrobatic dance moves performed by street artists.The tapas bar across the Hotel is not bad for a quick bite but there are so many other dining options nearby so you could give this one a miss. Carrefour is 2 minutes away from the hotel which means you could get your essentials anytime at reasonable prices. A quick stroll on La Rambla would lead you to Mercat Le Boqueria- a great place for breakfast and lunch . Must trys are Pinotxo Bar and El Quim. Everything is sold at the mercat ( pastries, bread, cheese, fruit drinks, chocolates, biscuits etc ) so you could also pick up a few items for breakfast/lunch/snack on the go, particularly when you are going on a long sightseeing trail. For photos of and travel tips on the mercat and Barcelona pls check out http://sunlifeshinefree.blogspot.com/. Attractions: La Rambla, Barri Gothic, the Port Vell and the Placa de Catalunya to name a few are all within walking distance of the hotel. Public Transport: The metros are very near and so are the bus stops. Helpful Staff The staff in Turin Hotel were friendly and helpful. We bought our Bus Turistic tickets and the flamenco show tickets from the reception. They also helped us with our car rental to Girona.

The staff was friendly - they spoke English quite well - they made dinner reservations for us and gave us pointers for shopping, dining and touring. Our rooms were basic yet quite functional - beds, closets, cabinets for luggage and desks. The decor is what I would call Scandinavian and was comfortable yet stark. There was good water pressure in the shower. Built in hair dryers and safe in the closet. One trip I stayed with one other person and the other time there were four of us in single beds in the room. I don't think there are many hotels that can accommodate four singles per room. And because of the four per room, the rate was really reasonable. The location of this hotel cannot be beat - it is a half block off of Las Ramblas - close enough for convenience yet not too close for the noise and hoards of people. Hotel Turin is on the same block as a 5 star Hotel and while I didn't go into the expensive hotel, I did not feel that I was missing anything by being at the Turin. Just across the street and about 30 feet away is a full service grocery and a half a block away is the wonderful Mercat de la Boqueria with its wonderful fruit, vegetable,seafood and meat stalls. The displays are works of art in themselves. There are also cafes in the market. The hotel is within walking distance to the Port of Barcelona, the Cathedral and the Gothic Quarter. The hotel has a plan that includes breakfast, but we did not take advantage of that either of my stays... we went to the Market area down the street. Breakfast is the only meal served in the hotel - there are restaurants across the street and next door.
