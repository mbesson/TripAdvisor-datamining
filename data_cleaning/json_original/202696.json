It is steeped in Italian tradition and the general decor is simply stunning. The location is literally a minute's walk from St Mark's Square so it's perfect if you want to be in the hub of it all. The staff are courteous, helpful and professional. One point to consider is that for the amount of mony spent, you could expect a larger room. The deluxe was a little disappointing in size, but overal, the typical venetian style and the small balcony overlooking the small canal below were charming. Ask for a high room floor to get the best possible view. We were on the 3rd floor and our view of the Grand Canal was restricted. In terms of comfort and cleanliness, the double bed was two beds joined together (as with many European hotels) and there was a morning maid service as well as turn down service in the evening. The hotel also has its own private landing strip for the water taxis so arriving in one of these and straight into the hotel is a fabulous and glamourous experience. Enjoy it! Incidently, the hotel also offers a courtesy water taxi to a glass making factory in Murano. If you have an appreciation for fine Murano glass and intend purchasing, then this place is worth going to. We don't and the pushy guide who took us around the showroom was very disgruntled that we didn't buy anything! The breakfast room in the hotel is magnificent - the ceiling frescos were created by students under Tiepolo's tutelage and it was a real pleasure to start the day off in these breathtaking surroundings. The quality and choice of the buffet breakfast was excellent. For those who would be interested in WiFi, there is no free access. An hourly charge is applied. Venice itself is a beautiful city. The best way to appreciate it is by foot. Apart from the obvious attractions like the Basilica, Doges Palace, Bell Tower, Rialto Bridge, Academy Bridge, it is just lovely to walk the small winding streets and discover a little church or browse past the quaint shops. Or just sit in a street cafe with a gelato and watch a gondola pass by. A gondola experience is a must - it is approx EUR 80 for approx 30 minutes and you can pick them up all around the city. We also enjoyed afternoon tea at Florian, which is an early 18th Century tea room, with an Orchestra that plays outside to add to the ambience. It is not cheap (a cup of tea with cost EUR 10) but this is the premium you pay around St Mark's and for us, it was worth doing. Meal times - we adore Italian food so dining for us was no problem. We picked places at random and were not disappointed. If however your palate craves something else, there is a Hard Rock Cafe just off St Mark's Sq. A superb stay in a superb hotel in a superb city.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Various", "Title": "\u201cFantastic location\u201d", "Author": "stargazer43", "ReviewID": "UR128384100", "Content": "Went at Carnival time in February and wanted a hotel with a great location and some style. based on Trip Advisor reviews I managed to get a room at the hotel for a week. My initial impression when I wrote to the hotel asking them if they could arrange to pick me up from the airport and was told to write to the Concierge - instead of forwarding my email - was not good! I also asked the hotel to reserve a table for me at a well known and popular restaurant and all I got was a response that their restaurant was very good and I should book there instead? I got this response twice despite politely declining their kind invitation! Not a good start.... However, once they picked up the ball everything ran like clock work. We were met as promised and elegantly transferred via the Grand Canal to the hotel. The only hiccup was when we arrived no one was there to take the luggage so I was obliged to heave the suitcases from the boat onto the jetty.... Our check in was warm and friendly. The General Manager came to receive us and it felt more like being welcomed into somebody's house than a hotel. Top marks here. Our room was small but bijou. You can see it on their web site. The only thing that let it down was a noisy HVAC fan whose bearings were clearly worn out. Breakfast is served in the former ballroom of this Palazzo with beautiful classical paintings to compliment a good, if not fantastic, buffet breakfast managed professionally by ever attentive staff. We eventually had dinner in the hotel and the food was excellent. Snacks and drinks are served in the downstairs bar all day. Again good quality food, drink and service. In the evenings they have, on occasion, a great musician playing a wide repertoire of music. The concierge team are first rate. Helpful, attentive and ever ready to offer good advice and to please. If you stay in this hotel, use them as they can improve the overall quality of your stay in this beautiful city. The hotel is situated literally around the corner from St Marks Square, the heart of the city. But its location is in a quiet backwater so after beating your way through the crowds and noise you turn a corner and it is quiet and clear. The Baglioni stages masked balls with food, period dancing and modern disco dancing to live music as well as via a DJ. They are well organised, a lot of fun and the best thing is you get to meet people from all over the world who are there to have fun. All ages, all sizes. Dressed up and masked. You can rent everything you need from Paola who manages a rental business in the hotel. One of the nicest people you can ever hope to meet who will advise and help you select a costume. She has a great team who despite the pressure always deliver. A great complimentary service to the hotel Baglioni. I can recommend this hotel without reservation. It is expensive, but for a special trip in a special city that will leave memories for life it is worth it", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Geneva, Illinois", "Title": "\u201cGreat Location!\u201d", "Author": "samlab25", "ReviewID": "UR128080020", "Content": "Venice was the last stop on our Italian vacation. We were traveling with our 10 year old son and we prefer suites as opposed to adjoining rooms for him. We had a wonderful arrival in the private water taxi they arranged, right up the front door of the hotel. Very romantic. Our room was not quite ready, so we had lunch in the main dining room. Nice, great staff, however, our favorite things from the menu were our son's Veal Milanese and the Evolution of Tiramisu (mint, berry and traditional tiramisu). As soon as our suite was ready we headed up, the room was nice, very large with a GREAT view of the Lagoon. Our room was the Tizano Suite. It was very spacious and definitely decorated in the Venitian style. The one thing we did not like about the suite was the exercise bike in the room blocking one of the windows overlooking the Lagoon. I was hoping to place one of the comfy wing chairs there and read. When asking the concierge if they could remove the bike, he was taken aback, but when we returned to the hotel that night, it was gone. Hopefully thy did not put it back. It takes away the charm of such a beautiful view and the Venetian style. I would like to have seen the electronics in the rooms (small TV's just sitting on top of tables with multiple cords, 5 channels, etc.) a little more updated, however, one does not come to Venice to sit in the room and watch TV or browse the internet for hours. It is a city to be enjoyed and revered. There were a few things, electronics included, that would prevent me from giving the hotel 5 stars. The hotel was beautiful, but something about it was bordering on older, just in need of some updating and renovations. Nothing was sub par or sub standard, but it just didn't have quite the shine or polish of a true 5 star. That said, I would still recommend this hotel.

It is very beautiful inside and the ballroom where they serve breakfast is particularly spectacular. Our room was large and grand but I was disappointed with the bathroom as it was extremely tired looking and, judging by other reviews, some rooms have state of the art bathroom suites. However, it was spotlessly clean. I was there for a special birthday and wish my husband had mentioned this to the management as we might have received a complimentary upgrade. Our room overlooked a courtyard, the cost of lagoon view rooms was prohibitive. There were no drink making facilities in the room apart from a mini bar and this was unfortunate. The breakfast selection was excellent and once more the service could not faulted. The staff could not do enough for you and the Concierge was marvellous, at our request he recommended a number of restaurants and made the reservations for us. Il Paradiso on the other side of the Rialto Bridge was particularly good and full of locals which is always a good sign. On our first night we ate in the hotel's restaurant Canova, we were waited on like royalty and the food was good. However, it was shockingly expensive so make sure you look at the prices prior to booking a table, the menu you are presented with at the table is price free and, after a complimentary glass of Prosecco, it is easy to throw caution to the wind and splash out. The hotel arrange a daily complimentary water taxi to Murano. Upon arrival a very kind lady helped me step out of the taxi and then I realised she had appointed herself our guide and consequent sales person. It was a very hard sell but we are not naive and only purchased because we wanted to. With hindsight I wish we had made our own way to the island and had the option to tour a number of factories and Murano itself alone rather than being committed to one location. In terms of time of year, it was exceptionally bitterly cold and in the outer regions, the water was slushy ice. It was nice and sunny though. We were able to get a table on St Marks Square which I should imagine is more of a challenge in the spring and summer. It was the Venice Carnival during our stay and lovely to see the locals in their beautiful costumes and masks.

We were given a suite at no extra cost, with a bottle of prosecco waiting for us in our room. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left we were treated as royalty, from exceptionally efficient and courteous room service, to friendly bartenders to incredibly accommodating restaurant staff (do try the hotel Restaurant, called the Canova, it is delicious!). All in all, full marks for this Hotel, and an absolute must for anyone who wishes to travel to Venice. It doesn't get much better than this. Lastly, remember that Venice is expensive, not the kind of place one goes on a budget holiday, so even though this hotel is slightly higher in price than others, the value for money is second to none.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cGreat hotel, great location.\u201d", "Author": "RobSq", "ReviewID": "UR121534608", "Content": "The hotel was great as was the staff.

We ordered A mixed antipasto salad, Chicken salad club sandwich with french fries, a mozzarella and tomato sandwich, and a few ice cold caffe fredos that were shaken in a cocktail shaker.

So, I'll start this review by saying that we arrived on the Orient Express and also stayed in the Hotel Relais dell'Orologio in Pisa, the Hassler Hotel in Rome and Il San Pietro in Positano. All the hotels that we stayed in had free WiFi, which was very nice change from UK hotels! At the Luna, we had a beautiful suite (Sandro Botticelli) with large rooms and a view to St Mark's tower from the sitting room and a small balcony off the bedroom, which had a narrow view across the grand canal. The bed was comfortable but had rather rough sheets on it. They felt more like the sheets you would find on a hospital bed rather than in a five star hotel. They were probably some sort of very posh material and I'm simply showing my ignorance but the sheets were not to my liking. Altogether I found the place rather charmless. Apart from the reception/concierge staff, the rest of the staff were a fairly disinterested lot. My biggest gripe was breakfast. This is served in an enormous and fabulous room. However, it's a clinical buffet affair with stressed-looking, overworked staff. The hotel caters for large groups and when they all descend on breakfast together, the staff find it very difficult to keep up. On our first morning, the coffee was cold. We didn't ask for fresh, since that would have taken too long. There was a good choice of buffet items but I think you'd still be waiting if you'd ordered eggs to be cooked for you. It was not the sort of experience I would expect from a hotel like this. The hotel bar is very bland and the waiter was much more interested in doing something else behind the scenes rather than waiting on tables and taking orders. I left the place rather underwhelmed (even more so, after having to have a cold shower on the last morning).

We stayed in the Giorgone Suite was is sumptuous and has views of the lagoon from the bedroom and the lovely sun deck. That said, every hotel I've stayed at in Venice (Gritti Palace, Cipriani, Danieli, Londra Palace, now here) has some magnificent rooms and some really crummy rooms. In this town, if you want a good view, you pay for it. This hotel doesn't have the sheer glamour of reputation of the Danieli, for example, but there are a few things to consider. My daughter stayed at the Danieli this past June. Both for check-in and check-out there were long lines of people waiting, one person working very slowly, and multiple other hotel employees standing around chatting. Even at busiest times, I never waited more than a minute or two for what was always careful attention at the Luna Baglioni. I also certainly had no problem getting porters to take care of my bags. Another thing is breakfast. The breakfast buffet at the Danieli was decent, but the cooked egg dishes were often mediocre. Breakfast here was sumptuous (and overseen by a very pleasant and heartily cheerful woman who really went out of her way to make sure guests were well tended to and happy) and the omelets I had and fried eggs my partner had were really excellent. The brioche and croissants here were also top quality, as were the meats, fruits and cheeses as well as the coffee. The breakfast room and main restaurant are beautiful in the old Venetian style; the breakfast room covered in lavish murals and local glass chandeliers. The furnishings in our room were also classic Venetian but in no way old or run-down and the bathroom facilities (shower, etc.) were modern and worked very well. For me, the location is absolutely the best. You don't have the crowd situation that you do in front of the Danieli or Londra Palace, but you are RIGHT THERE for Piazza San Marco. The only downside to the location is that you are dangerously close to expensive and tempting shopping (Loro Piana, Bottega Veneta). Even given the possible variability of the rooms, which we didn't experience, I'm going to rate this high for value because of the location and the service. They have a dock that leads out onto the main lagoon on one side, which means you can arrange water taxi service right to the hotel. You can also walk a very short stretch to the main San Marco vaporetto stop.

My wife and I had booked Luna Hotel Baglioni as well as several other hotels in other parts of Italy for our honeymoon. Just two weeks after our wedding at the end of April, my wife was diagnosed with a severe internal ailment which required surgery and completely forced the cancellation of our entire honeymoon. With less than 3 weeks notice in advance of our arrival, the management of this hotel provided me with a complete refund. Although part of our payment was non-refundable, they were able to 'bend' their policy to provide us with full return of our funds in this severe time of need. We tremendously appreciate this gesture and cannot thank them enough for their consideration in a time of severe challenge and need for my wife, myself, and our families. While this may seem 'normal' for a hotel to provide a refund under such dire extenuating circumstances, we have been completely screwed by another hotel in Italy, specifically on Sardinia, called 'Faro Capo Spartivento', an alleged 'world class' 5 star hotel. I provided them with 25 days notice and the circumstances of our cancellation, yet they have with-held more than 1400 euro from me and refuse to communicate whatsoever with me and provide me with any rationale why. So in summary, I want to provide the utmost confidence that Luna Hotel Baglioni is run by very good, conscientious, and respectful management, and I hope to stay there at a point in the future when my wife's recovery allows.

When we arrived, they first upgraded us to a suite (from a junior suite), and our room was pure luxury. The hotel represents Venice well - there are apparently two buildings tied together to make one so that our room was on floor 4 and a half and we had to walk up a small flight of stairs to get to it. However, the room was really 4 rooms and was beautiful and comfortable. The bedroom was the quietest, darkest, most comfortable room we found in Italy. Truly luxurious bed (the most comfortable we found in two weeks)! The bathroom was beautiful. Also, the staff were very attentive. The first night we arrived, the internet was not working nor was our phone. However, the staff helped us by giving us access to a private phone, and the problem was fixed by the next morning. The internet was very slow which was the one frustration. If doing business while in Italy is important to you, this may not be the place for you. We could not get Skype to work because of the connection. However, everything else about the hotel was awesome. In addition, the hotel is 20 steps from St. Marks Square so it is very convenient. It is also just steps from the San Marco Vaparetto stop and has a private canal for private taxis or gondola rides. We didn't use the restaurants, but there were multiple restaurants available.

Sofas and wing chairs, writing tables, leading through an arch to the bedroom and dressing room, most beautifully furnished in 19th century style. We had an exercise bike and three TV's (not that we watched any TV of course). The bathroom was equipped with the biggest marble shower, a free standing bath and a double sink unit. The window on this side overlooked the bell tower in St Mark's square. Indeed this hotel was close to everything. Harry's Bar 30 metres away as is the square itself. Valparetto (river transport) stop is also very close. Breakfast was included in the package and there simply was everything you could wish for. The one dinner (included in the package)we had at the hotel was very high end. Four courses (excluding beverages) of beautifully cooked food.

We had a confortable stay. Our room had no view but it was so quiet and cozy that made up for a great spot to rest and get some good sleep. The beds and pillows were very comfortable with very fine linens. There was a TV as well threatening to take us out of the room and I am proud to say that we never turned it on. The spacious bathroom was my favorite part of the room, with a large size shower head and a towel rack warmer inside the shower area. Very good quality towels and bathrobes, and plenty of decent quality toiletries as well. The staff was very helpful making phone calls and reservations for us when needed. My only observation on the staff is that they could be a little more friendly. Just smile a little bit... it goes further than you think! Public and private water transportation access is within few meters of the hotel. There were also 2 surprises: one good and the other bad. The good surprise is that the Restaurant Canova at the hotel is excellent. We went to few other restaurants for lunch and dinner and the restaurant at the hotel was the best one of all. The bad surprise is that the\" free trip\" to Murano Glass Factory is a scam. If i was the owner of this hotel I would never put my guest in such an uncomfortable situation. i was interested in seeing process of glass making and asked in the front desk about the tour to the island and how to book it. The person in the desk told me that every half hour there is a boat that takes guest from the hotel and to just let him know when I would like to go. About how much is the trip for two? I asked. \"There is a promotion on going for guests of our hotel and we are offering the trip at no charge.\" No charge? I asked in disbelief. \"Yes, no charge\". He replied Later that morning my husband and I were in a private boat going to the island. When we got there, there was a very brief show of the process of glass making because all the workers were on vacation- they told us- and we didn't see what we went to see. Sooner than wished there was this sales person taking us through the showrooms and pushing really hard for us to buy something. He claimed that he had seeing my eyes go big after viewing a Veronese style water jar on one of the shelves and he was ready to negotiate: the original price for that particular piece was E. 4,900.00 but, since I was staying at this hotel, I would get a discount of 50%, bringing the price down to E. 2,450.00 which he thought was a good deal. I told him very clear that I was not interested. Then he went to speak to another black suit man and he said he got an even better deal on the same item: E. 1,550.00 I had to be very straight forward and harsh at times to get rid of them and I knew that my ride back to the hotel was in their hands. Not a good situation to be in. i had to be very strong and hated the concierge that had set this trip up without giving us a full version of what it was. i wasn't looking for a free ride to Murano, he offered it as a promotion from the hotel, not from the Murano glass company. We didn't buy anything and it felt so good to be in the boat on our way back to the hotel. Oops! they brought us back to the Sn. Marco square this time.

The room we were checked into was not lagune view, and requested that we be moved into the room type we reserved. We were moved to another room that had a slight view of the lagune but had no jacuzzi. We requested that we be moved into the room type that we reserved and told them that we did not appreciate having to be moved again. We were told that there were no other rooms for us to move to and it was left for us to decide which of the two rooms we'd care to stay in. We made some phone calls because we were quite taken aback by what seemed kinda bait and switchy at a leading 5 star property. It was soon after that point that we were apologized to and offered another room by the hotels assistant manager who came to our door personally and led us to the Canale Suite. After a bumpy start, we began to enjoy our stay in Venice. The hotel is lovely. It is conveniently located right off St Marks Square, around the corner from Harry's, and there is a private landing dock right outside the hotels entrance, perfect. The two junior suites we were shown and the suite we stayed in were all wonderful. This 800 year old property has beautiful interior spaces. We did use the hotel dining room and lounge and enjoyed each very much and would have returned but there were so many other great places to visit. Our room was spotless, we felt well taken care of by all service people, with the exception of the front desk, and were satisfied with our stay. When we return to Venice other options like the Gritti Palace, Daniele, Bauer Il Palazzo, etc are all beautiful places too, it'll be so hard to choose where to stay next ! It's not okay to advertise a room rate that includes amenities that are then not provided. Since our visit in 2006 Luna Baglioni has changed it's website and they no longer offer the exact room type we reserved. This review reflects our experience with the hotels front desk personnel at that time and feel that a point should be deducted for what we felt was entirely their fault, they left it to us as 'too bad' and did not offer to reduce our rate, or any other remedy, and we reported it immediately. The hotel did correct errors made by the front desk staff and we were glad because the price and amenities were why we chose this hotel over the many other choices in Venice.

I was so annoyed when we dined there on our first night in Venice. All I want to say is if you can afford it stay at The Cipriani - it is fabulous - it is a very simple easy boat trip from San Marco square which takes apx 5 minutes in a lovely and comfortable boat. There are beautiful gardens, restaurants and views. There is a large swimming pool and the service is fantastic. You can dine outside in the beautiful sunshine and have stunning views. The Luna Baglioni - has no such area to sit outside - there is little natural light in many of the rooms. The breakfast room is in the old ballroom which is fabulous but no natural light or views of anything. Also everyone seems to be woken by delivery boats, bin disposal boats etc every morning if your room is on the same side as the main entrance. In my opinion there are nicer 5star hotels indeed nicer 4star hotels - Most hotels are ideally located as Venice is small and easy to walk about everywhere. The Danelli, The Bauer (the one on the Grand canal), a few others I spotted and checked out whilst I was there where really very nice.

Our overall stay was nice, but not excellent. The hotel has a very old world feel, with likewise decor. Given the lack of more modern hotels in Venice, this is a great option, however there was some room for improvement. The rooms, mostly the bathrooms, are starting to show signs of wear and are in need of an update. The furniture, however, is very elegant. Having booked through the American Express Fine Hotels Resorts program, the included amenities are decent, most notable a nice upgrade, but the other food amenities (in terms of quality) were not the best out of all our travels. Staff: The staff does do a nice job at providing good service and answering questions promptly and with great knowledge. They are genuinely helpful when approached. The concierge was excellent, always helpful and giving tips on good restaurants, shops, and directions. No matter how many questions we asked, he was always pleasant and knew the answers. If you do go to Murano, choose the glass factory you go to after doing research on your own. One note - unless approached, however, the staff never went out of their way to make you feel welcome and never addressed you when you entered/exited the hotel nor never wished you a pleasant day. In fact, after taking a water taxi to the hotel from the rail station, no bellman was there to help with our luggage and staff just seemed to watch us as we entered the hotel, with luggage in tow. Room: We stayed in the \"Suite Giorgione\" or Presidential Suite. The 2 floor suite was elegantly decorated with fine antique furniture and wonderful Murano glass chandeliers. The room was extremely spacious and comfortable, as one would expect. A nice outdoor terrace has 270+ degree view and overlooks the Venetian rooftops and San Marco Plaza. While there is a small view of the Grande Canal, this suite does not directly face the Grande Canal. The bathrooms are nicely appointed, however are beginning to show signs of wear and could use an updating. Water leaked when we took showers and the window shades did not roll up properly. The suite also smelled strongly of liquor as soon as we walked into it. Overall the suite is elegant and nicely furnished. Hotel Food: The breakfast room is spectacular, although the food did not match. While the buffet breakfast is very extensive and has many choices, the quality is just average and not up to par with what a true luxury property should have. We did not eat in the main restaurant for dinner, although we did have lunch in the bar area/cafe. The waiter/bartender is very slow and not attentive. Lunch in the cafe was subpar for both our meals. On a side note, if you are in search of an excellent restaurant for dinner, go to Da Fiore (www.dafiore.net), the best restaurant in Venice (well worth the price). It was truly one of the best meals and service we had in all of Italy (do not confuse it with another restaurant with a similar name). Overall, this property is a nice option in Venice and its location is one of the best. Having decided that Venice does not really have any true 5+ star hotels as other cities do, the Luna Hotel is probably one of the better hotels in Venice. With a few improvements and service changes, this hotel could be the best.", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "DC", "Title": "\u201cA Magical Location\u201d", "Author": "DCtrippers", "ReviewID": "UR24899958", "Content": "My partner and I and two close friends went to Venice to celebrate my 50th birthday and we hoped to find a special hotel that would enhance our experience of this incredible city.

There is no better location in the City, only one building removed -and so protected- from the noise and crowds of St. Mark's Square, it is surrounded by upscale shops in a very safe area. The hotel is accessible by both foot and the water, with arrivals by water taxi being highly recommended. The vaporetto was 25 euros per person from the airport, the same as our water taxi, except that the water taxi was non-stop and all our own, and it took a much more scenic route, so it was a far better deal. The time just before Carnival is an especially good time to come, as the crowds are thin, and Venice's best restaurants are yours for the taking. The hotel was perfect - and the desk was extremely accomodating. Hats off go to the manager, Maurizio D'Este, who not only provided us an unasked, complimentary room upgrade in honor of my birthday, along with a chilled bottle of Asti Spumante on my special day. The staff gave great advice, helped make all requested arrangements, and made arrival and departure worry free. Our only suggestion for improvement would be that they should really include breakfast with the rooms, as the price would seem to justify it. That being said, the morning of our departure, while we were waiting for our water taxi to take us away in the dark before 6 am, the night staff had laid out hot coffee and tea for us - which was a welcome send off gift.

It is indeed a beautiful, almost faultless hotel with its own landing stage, an absolute must for a hotel in Venice to avoid trawling the narrow crowded streets with suitcases. We booked a junior suite as reports I'd read had suggested that double rooms were a bit on the small side. We were glad we did. We were also aware from fellow travellers that it could be noisy. Our suite, although sumptuous, was still on the petite side but full of antiques and very clean although it did face the building opposite over a narrow lane, so there was no particular view. Nothing adequately prepared us for the din coming from the street below on our first night though. We were exhausted from a very early flight and looking forward to a good rest but our room was on the side of the hotel over the Gucci shop, which lead directly to one of the boat landing stages. For most of our three nights the noise coming from people walking to and fro to the vaporetto was apallingly loud even though they were only talking. This was probably due in part to the narrow street and high buildings which filters the noise upwards. Sleepng with the window open therefore was not an option. After the first night, we went to a chemist and bought earplugs. These were brilliant and afforded us two really good nights' sleep after that. I would recommend this hotel mainly because it has an excellent location. On our second night we had a lovely meal in the hotel restaurant, which is well worth a try even though it is not cheap by any means. The staff are helpful too. On another note, first time visitors should be aware that Venice is both horrendously crowded and very expensive so be prepared. We tended to wander to more 'Italian' parts of the city and sit and eat with the locals as the food is still very good but about a third of the price and it's less frantic. On our last day we travelled to the Lido, which is worth a visit as the beach is long and sandy and pretty deserted at this time of year.

I had booked this as a surprise and I managed to get him all the way on the plane before he found out the destination!

The triple room we stayed in was very spacious for a family of three including a teenager. The room was clean, but the curtain had a smoking smell despite being a non-smoking room. Also, we found it inconvenient that there were closets but no chest for unpacking clothes. It had free wireless internet connectivity. The hotel is in a great location close to sites, but it is in a very crowded section of the town. We usually select a hotel in the center of the town, but in Venice, it is so easy to take water buses to everywhere, so we may stay in a less crowded place next time if we go back. The hotel staff were all professional but some were much more friendly than others, and the quality seemed to vary. As for dining, I had read reviews of others and had a dinner at hotel's Canova restaurant, but I feel it is overrated. The quality was decent, but when appetizers cost more than 30 euros, I expect higher quality. In contrast, the neighborhood restaurant Osteria San Marco that the concierge recommended was the best among seven or eight we tried in three cities - Siena, Florence, and Venice - during our trip. Breakfast at the hotel was Ok. The price at this hotel was a bargain compared with other 5-star hotels, and given its location and a decent room (at least in the case of our triple room), this hotel is worth a visit for someone who prefers a luxury hotel but has a limited budget. However, if we go back, I probably want to try some other 5-star hotel for comparison, and as mentioned before, we may look for a hotel in a less crowded place or even a different island.", "Date": "July 5, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Check in / front desk": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Atlanta", "Title": "\u201cSuperb location and experience\u201d", "Author": "Everycontinent", "ReviewID": "UR17454542", "Content": "We stayed two nights at the Luna Hotel Baglioni and also enjoyed three other properties in the Baglioni Hotels group in other cities.

We walked to the Teatro La Fenice for an amazing performance of Tosca. The very kind and efficient Concierge, Antonio Massari, managed to get incredible box seats for our group of four. We contacted him by e-mail several weeks before the trip. We procured a gondola right outside the lobby bar for a ride at dusk, and for our return to the train station for a sad departure from Venice, a water taxi picked us up in the same place - making baggage handling a breeze.

After slogging thru countless Hotel websites, trying to choose a grand but reasonably priced Hotel facing the San Marco Lagoon, I realised the Luna Baglioni offered the best value for money - though not the cheapest, but for the quality of the rooms and the location that they offer, its good value for money, trust me. The Hotel is located on the same block as the Harry's Bar, turn left upon arrving by water bus/taxi at the San Marco stop, cross a small bridge and turn right immediately when you see Calle Valleresco. It is really amazing how close the Hotel is located to the St Mark's square, merely steps I would say. Nearby are Chanel and other branded luxury shops. The only negative is, such shops close early at 7pm, but this also makes the Hotel extremely quiet at night, important for jet lagged visitors like us. Free wine/champagne and chocolate coated strawberries were nice touches upon arrival. However, breakfasts was not included in the price and since we couldn't eat that much early in the morning, decided to give it a miss. I had a chance to see its Marco Polo saloon's grandeur, where breakfasts were served each morning and its really quite fascinating I must say!

We stayed there in April 2007, two adults and a 10 year old child. For our Italy trip, with stops in various cities, I priced hotels through various means, including consolidators like Expedia and Travelocity, certain smaller booking websites, and correspondence with the hotels directly (either by e-mail or telephone). In this particular case I found the best deal at the Hotel Luna Baglioni by booking through the Leading Hotels of the World. After I had a reservation, I communicated with the hotel directly via e-mail to request help with transfers from the Marco polo airport to the hotel. They arranged a water taxi for me at a cost that was significantly cheaper than the best deal I could find myself on the internet. A side note on transfers. It is possible, and easy, to take an inexpensive vaporetto from the airport into the city. In my case, with a wife, young daughter and lots of luggage, it was better to use the far more expensive water taxi. The hotel arranged everything. Someone met us after we cleared customs, took us by car to the water taxi dock, then the water taxi transported us directly to the hotel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own dock. This was far, far easier than shepherding my family and luggage on and off the vaporetto then dragging the luggage through the streets and bridges of Venice to the hotel.

The kids loved feeding the hundreds of pigeons and we then went on a gondala ride (Euro100) quite expensive but well worth it as you get a guided tour and lets face it you only do it once. The driver even sung under the many bridges and I know it was an experience you HAVE to do. In the evening the hotel conciege suggested a low key tratteora , called Dela Pazza, . We were again surprised by how nice everyone was. The next day we went to the water bus to the jewish quater which was very interesting and the kids having leftover bird seeds fed the pigeons along the way. We walked to the Riata bridge and again went local for lunch. The children had ots of fun along the way buying glass animals and looking at all the masks. The last day we went to Morano. It was a great experience, one I would not suggest with very young children...but mine found the blowing of the glass facinating. In the afternoon the sun came out and we went back to the square for ice-cream and to listen to the wonderful orchestras. A few tips....Venice is walking ONLY. Take very comfi walking shoes. Great shops...all the brands...explore the side alleys off the San Marco square...lovely little shops. Stay close to the Square as all the action in the evening is in the square and it can be very tiring at the end of a long day trekking back to the hotel.

Also didn't want to pay the sky-high prices of other 5-star hotels like Bauer...I don't regret the decision at all! First of all position is the best - especially if you have a room at the front or on the courtyard side), the back might be noisy from shopping street crowd in the daytime - it also leads to bus-stop so always people walking). We were upgraded first to deluxe room - and it was new and well-renovated in reds and golds - beautiful bright room. So don't think from reviews that all the rooms are old. We didn't actually take this room as there was some work going on in the courtyard and i prefer peace and quiet (the work is temporary). So we moved to superior room (orirginally booked - the staff did give us a choice) - it was a little smaller and not newly-done but it had an amasing position at the front with a balcony from which you can glimpse SanMarco basin, and from the window - a little park. and a clean small canal Also no foot traffic as the street ends there. You get taxis arriving - but not often (and you are not closed in like in courtyard room - you can watch what's going in vicinity. The room and bathroom were reasonable size - not too small at all, with two armchairs and a table, not just beds. Now about decor that people complain about. I say it's all a matter of perception: yes, it's faded and has some darkened marks in the corners near ceilings (may be it's damp air - but it's not dirt ) like you get on old buildings, but still you can see that the wallpaper is not cheap and still silky - just faded, that's all! Also while they are getting to redecorate, they do put other nice new touches - new bedspreads and chair fabric. Chandeliers are still beauitiful /traditional, and all the furniture highly polished. So i wasn't bothered at all - it just makes you realise you are in an old place, but still a cared for old place. it's the oldest hotel in Venice so i don't know why people complain if they knew it - it's possible to find a modern place if that's what you want. Still, even with the drawbacks the place is still more a 5-star hotel than 4-star. The hall is very beatiful and lots of crystal and paintings everywhere. As to the dim lighting - i agree - the fact is they just don't replace bulbs often enough (we had to ask to put new bulbs in our room - but they did it quickly) - in the corridors they should put more effort themselves. My complaint was the breakfast - although the choice of cold foods was fitting to a 5-star, the hot food and it's quality wasn't! Eggs and bacon always overcooked and instead of replenishing often, they just let it stew for ages - not good! Also the service is not adequate - no one ever collects your used plates while you are eating - and this is buffet so you do change several plates. There are just 2 waitresses for a big room. Teapots are tiny. On the other hand the dinner/lunch restaurant is great! Charming service and very good food! Not cheap but not too expensive for the standard. Great cooking! Though there is no view, the room is nice in an old-fashioned way with flowers and some music Not the brightest of rooms but i think it's dark-ish for atmosphere..

At the airport we had a guy with our name waiting to take us in a road taxi 3 minutes to the water taxi. Then wisked into the water taxi, where we were taken via the canals to the Hotel's doorstep. The entrance is amazing and every other part of the Hotel follows suite. We entered our Junior suite to the sight of Champers and chocolate dipped strawberries. Room was amazing, view looked over the waterfront. Everything was just as it looked in the pictures on the internet. Breakfast was superb with everything from scrambled eggs, cold meats through to a smoked salmon to cut your own slivers from.

His response time to any issues was in terms of half hours rather than minutes. I had read mixed reports about the desk staff, some brilliant, some poor. My guess would be that the poor reviews all relate to this guy on the night shift. On our second night we met up with 2 couples from the US and Columbia, while sat on the small but intimate bar balcony overlooking the canal. Our Columbian friend Rafael negotiated for the six of us to go on a night time Gondola ride with a second Gondola floating alongside with our own private musical entourage. AMAZING. After that we did not take up the free Gondola ride as part of our package, as how could we top that. The hotel is perfectly positioned just at the side of San Marco square, 30 seconds away, yet so quiet and has its own canal point. Nice touches with the hotel are the questionaire sent prior to going on holiday, asking what type of scented candles you prefer and things like what pillow would you prefer. The free hotel slippers are also a nice touch. Every night we are home wearing our slippers reminds us of the Luna.

They did have double sinks, but I would expect that for the money we paid for these rooms. None of my other expectations were met by this hotel. I would have expected a classic double to be better than what we got with a deluxe double. I actually thought we had been given the wrong class of room when we checked in. I went down to the front desk to confirm that we were in a deluxe double and the girl at the desk was fairly rude about it. When I asked if we could move to other rooms in the deluxe double category and she told me we could not. She couldn't believe that we were not satisfied with our rooms. The AC did not work in one of our rooms. We had to go to bed with wet hair and a wet wash cloth on us! After 3 separate complaints about the AC we were finally moved to another room after our first night in the hot room. It was equally as ugly and gross as the original room.

We loved that it is right on the canal and there are not too many things you will experience in life more romantic than pulling right in front of the hotel with your boat! We stayed in a recently renovated wing of the hotel which, according to the front desk, was just completed about 2 months earlier. Our junior suite was exquisite with a large king size bed with wonderful linen sheets which looked brand new. The room had padded fabric brocard walls, a large walk-in closet, sitting area and a huge white marble bathroom (large jacuzzi tub, dual sinks and dual water-fall showers which were refreshing!). We couldn't help but to feel as if we were some distant relatives of the d'Medici family. Upon checking into our room, there was a large tray of chocolate dipped strawberries and a bottle of Prosecco. I would estimate that the room was approximately 500 or so square feet, which I think in Venice is probably pretty large. Not much of a view out of the windows other than what looked to be a utility alley of some sort although being on the fifth floor we really didn't mind (a nice canal or city view would have been nice though). Excellent hotel in general for honeymooners as it is tucked down a sleepy and quiet side street literally a block from San Marco (if you can believe that) which provides a lot of quiet and privacy. I bet a thousand people a day walk right past the street not even realizing that a 5 star hotel is a few feet away. Lounge is equally wonderful with a nice relaxed feel. Breakfast in the morning had pretty much everything you can think of from breads, fruits, eggs, salmon, etc. served in a room fit for royalty. We ate at the Canova restaurant for dinner one night which we thought was very good (the grappa cart for your after-dinner digestif is always a nice touch!). I especially liked the votive candles that they placed around the lobby and on the huge marble staircase at night which provided good ambience and set a very romantic tone. Also liked that you had to leave your key at the front desk when leaving the hotel which reminds me of old-world style hotels (the key fob looks like a bell and is so large and heavy you wouldn't want to carry it around anyways). Front desk personnel were very helpful and unintrusive. Cable internet access is free (as it should be - see my review of the Villa d'Este in Cernobbio/Como which wasn't at $1000 a night) and there was never a problem getting on the one computer that they have just off of the lobby.

This was our first visit to Europe. We were given an impromptu tour of the Grand Canal on our way to the Baglioni and it was a treat for us to arrive at the doorstep of our hotel by water taxi. The hotel was very prompt with our check-in process. We were pre-registered and were given our huge key and shown our room in quick order. The Luna has not gone the way of the electronic locks and still have the old fashioned room key. The key is on a massive key chain (a large gold tassel) which is to be turned into the front desk each time you leave the hotel (pick up on the way in). Very quaint. The lobby of the hotel is beautiful, marble floors, gleaming wooden staircase, antique (but roped-off) furniture. What was a little odd was the lighting. It was dim and a little on the gloomy side...as if they needed to somehow hide the interior with bad lighting. We were scheuled to have a \"deluxe\" accomodation level room. I've seen the pictures on the website of the various rooms available at the Luna and I must say that I was disappointed by my room - Room #102. We had a fairly spacious room with a king bed. I had the impression that most of the rooms had the romantic canopied beds and views of the water. Instead I got a comfortable bed sans canopy overlooking the alley between the hotel and an arcade of shops. My husband is not the type to complain and didn't want to ask about another room. So room #102 was our home for our two day stay. Like I said, the room was really quite spacious. But like the lighting, there was something a little off. I couldn't decide if the decor was \"shabby chic\" or just plain shabby. Faded walls, faded carpet. Very antique feel. The lights in the room were controled by switches located next to the bed (overhead, side light and privacy button). I'm pretty sure that our \"private\" light was not working because we kept getting knocks by the staff. There is a television in the room. Not exactly state of the art but it worked. It was a little on the smallish size (probably a 20' screen) and it was hard to figure out how to work the remote. We only watched CNN during our first couple of hours and spent most of our waking hours exploring the city. The was some sort of temperature control in the room. However, like the TV remote, we could never quite figure it out. We got a lot of \"fan\" action but no real cool air. It does get muggy and with our window just one story up from the street, we didn't feel good about opening the window for air during the day because of the noise from the foot traffic below. The bathroom was also pretty big. With a combination tub/shower and double sinks. The hair dryer was not exactly the most powerful of things, the one instance where you probably should bring your own (with the adapter). They don't have a shower curtain but use intead a half glass wall. I somehow managed to dislogde the half wall (it moves on a hinge) and the water leaked onto the floor. I know that I'm not the first because the carpet right outside the bathroom door had water damage. There was internet access which was extremely necessary for my workaholic husband. The hotel has not set up in-room access. Not the most convenient as you had to use the hotel's set up downstairs next to the coatroom. Pretty slow connection but at least you do have access. We had breakfast included in the room package. We're not really breakfast people, but the spread was as would be expected (some hot-eggs, bacon) more cold (cereal, fruit, pastries) with the ability to order ala carte from the breakfast menu. The breakfast room was quite a sight to see. The whole \"salon\" feel was overwhelming. I felt like I needed a wig and a corset. Beautiful ceiling and walls. The location of the hotel was perfecct for us. Really close (1/4 of a block) to St Mark's Square and next to the water bus stop for St Mark's. Lots of activity in the area for a first time Venice visitor - the doge palace, the basilica, the bridge of sighs, multiple souvenir vendors, feeding the pidgeons, gondola stands (which are just like starbuck - seemingly always around the corner), restaurants abound between the Square and the Rialto Bridge. We managed to get tickets for the Secret Itinerary Tour at the Doge Palace which was a lot of fun. It was the only chance we had to go inside one of the historic buildings. The lines were out the door for the basilica and the campanile. We fed the pigeons, saw all three bridges, took the gondola ride and paid way too much for it. Took pictures, bought glass and art and took enough pictures that even my 1 gig was not enough. Our whole goal was to just get lost in Venice. Share a romantic gondola ride, enjoy the sights and feel of this beautiful city. We would love to come back and bring our children to Venice.

Upon arriving via private water taxi (the hotel arranged for my transfer from the terminal to the private taxi to take me to the hotel) my first eyeview was lovely and charming to say the least. Arriving early Sunday morning my room was not ready as they had been full from the previous evening (I was booked for a deluxe room and the lesser category was available - I preferred to wait for my room) I decided to take a walk and get a coffee. Unfortunatetly when I returned from my coffee my room was still not ready so I decided to freshen up and venture out for lunch (Alla Madonna - near the Rialto bridge was wonderful) and when I returned back to the hotel after lunch my room was ready - and it was simply gorgeous. Large, decorated lovely, large bathroom, spotless and quiet. I was so happy that I decided to wait and not take the lesser category room. One of the most delightful little extras that the Baglioni does is at night when you return from dinner to your room there are candles lit in the bathroom and sleeping area. I found the concierge staff to be quite helpful and very friendly with some good restaurant recommendations (I did have a list of my own which we would discuss). One very valid and valued recommendation was to visit the Doges Palace late in the day after about 4:30pm - you will be amazed as there is no que and you can just walk right in. The staff had also pre-arranged a couple of excursions for me which were handled quite efficiently (a must is a private water taxi to the island of Torcello to lunch at Locando Cipriani which was wonderful.) Breakfast every morning was perfect - from choices to service . I was very pleasantly surprised by the hotels restaurant - it was excellent - from service to food.

Fake antique chairs abound, mixed in with a few genuine (roped-off) ones. The corridors are dismal to the point of suicidal: dimly lit, not in a romantic way, but rather in a \"has there been a power cut and is this the emergency lighting?\" way. The carpets have a dingy, worn-out feeling to them, and the room decor teeters on the fine line between faded Venetian flair and Wild West bordello. The hotel is well located in terms of access to San Marco, but in terms of backstreets you really are in the middle of the slightly-trashed-by-tourism side to Venice, along with the identikit designer boutiques you can see everywhere from Tokyo to LA.

What a terrific hotel! The staff were very friendly and accommodating and the service was excellent. The rooms were nice but a bit small; however, the bathroom was generous and well appointed. The location of the hotel is perfect for its proximity to the major tourist attractions. San marco is right next door! There are quite a few other hotels within easy reach of San marco, but Luna Baglioni is the only one adjacent to a vaporetto stop. as far as we could tell, it is also the only hotel with direct water access to the Grand Canal. Take a water taxi from the airport to the hotel as it is worth the price for door-to-door service. Ask the driver to take you through the Grand Canal on your way as it takes just as long as the direct route to the hotel and offers an incredible grand entrance into the city. The price for the private taxi service from the hotel is 90 Euro. We are so glad that we did this as it saved over an hour; although, catching the bus is easy as you only have to transfer once in Venice. If you have a lot of luggage then you may want to refrain from taking the bus as it was always completely packed and standing room only. From the airport you have to walk about 1,000 feet to the dock; it took us ten minutes to walk with large suitcases. You will not have to wait for a taxi - there will be plenty waiting. Finally, the food. BEWARE!!!! There are many restaurants that are simply tourist traps. The food was terrible and the service even worse. They always tried to rush you through your meal so that the next party could be seated in your place. The best restaurants were the establishments that were recommended to us by the hotel or other travelers. At these locations everything was perfect! So, get advise before blindly choosing a restaurant. Also, don't forget about the high cost of food and drinks in Venice. At restaurants you will pay $9-10 USD for a bottle of water or soda. At bars you will pay about $12-15 for a mixed drink or glass of wine. It's outrageous! But, you only get to go once right? Well, maybe more if you are fortunate. overall, the luna Baglioni is a great luxury hotel with the perfect location. Note: If you must leave the hotel early in the morning to catch a flight don't worry about getting to the airport 2 hours ahead of time. 45-60 minutes will do. The airport is small and not too busy in the morning. Also, water taxi's run all night and we had no problem booking a taxi at 5 in the morning. The bus to the airport runs early as well (I'm not sure of the hours but we saw people standing in the cold with their luggage waiting for it).", "Date": "March 8, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "3", "Service": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Hong Kong, China", "Title": "\u201cPerfect Location\u201d", "Author": "WharfTrader", "ReviewID": "UR4335319", "Content": "thought this was a great hotel - fantastic location right by san marco - moments from the vaporetto stop, and harry's bar is on the corner - got a great deal for the time of year so was nervous of the room - but we got a great one - no view from the room but hardly in it as there is plenty to see in venice! - the decor was a bit chintzy, but comfy - bathroom a good size - staff were professional - didn't eat there but the bar looked nice - excellent base for seeing the city - would recommend getting the bus to piazzale roma and then a vaporetto down the canal when you get there - great way to see the city - and very easy to get around with a good map and once you know where san marco and the rialto are - would recommend this hotel if you can get a good deal", "Date": "January 10, 2006"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Staffordshire, England", "Title": "\u201cBeautiful Baglioni\u201d", "Author": "carol30", "ReviewID": "UR4333119", "Content": "My husband and I have just got back from 3 fantastic nights at the Luna Baglioni.

We notified them that we were going to arrive early since we were on the morning flight into Venice. When we arrived at the hotel, they had our room ready for us and we were able to shower and begin our adventures in Venice. The breakfast buffet is huge and full of breads, meats, cheeses, lots of fresh fruit and juices. They also serve scrambled eggs (might have been from a mix though) and bacon. The breakfast room itself is like dining in an 18th century ballroom. The maitre d' and her staff were very accomodating. Our room was large, especially by European standards with plenty of closet space. The bathroom was double sink and here is the one drawback. The shower and tub were combined with only a small glass half door (typical in many European shower/tub combos). As a result, inexperienced bathers would likely get some water splashing around the bathroom and feel like you had to do your business in a more confined area. The hotel is very conveniently located near the St. Mark's ACTV stop and the square itself. Despite being located in such a busy area, the hotel and room were very quiet which was nice when you are trying to escape the crowds. Dinner at the restaurant was excellent and the service quite good. The concierge staff is helpful and can book concerts and dinner reservations. As for Venice itself, be prepared to pay a fortune to eat. The cheapest restaurants are still expensive and you should expect to pay around 50-70 EUR per person to eat at a decent establishment. It's all part of the island economy here. For transportation from the airport, we recommend buying the Alilaguna Oro (Gold) line ticket for 25EUR per person. We were actually transported by taxi with one other couple directly to Saint Marks. Don't miss the Peggy Guggenheim museum if you like modern art, it was one of the highlights of our trip. Also, try to take in a concert at one of the smaller venues, it was a treat. We saw Interpreti Veneziani's rendition of Vivaldi's Quattro Staggione.

Twenty paces from St Mark's Square, thirty from a vaparetto stop - you can't do better for location for your first visit to Venice.

The air-conned room and bathroom were spacious and spotlessly clean; both very well decorated with expensive furnishings. The bed was large and firm, with high thread count, expensive linens. The end of the toilet roll was perfectly folded and stuck down with a tiny crested sticker after the twice-daily housekeeping visits!! Lovely finishing touches also included crystal chandeliers, slippers and soft mats for the bedsides. The foyer and other areas of the hotel were beautiful and quiet. At night, candles were placed on the stairs leading from reception, a lovely sight to greet you on your return from a long day. Staff were pleasant and efficient at all times, spoke English very well and were happy to store bags on our final day in a secure room. We booked via the excellent website with no problem and received some lovely emails for confirmation. There was some confusion at the end of our stay where apparently the bill still had to be settled despite prebooking with a credit card. This was fine, however. Harry's Bar is on the same block - if you can afford it, pay 20 Euros for a small glass of Bellini at one of the tables (cheaper at the bar, but you'll be pursuaded to sit down!), and then amble over to St Mark's for a cafe latte at Florian. That will blow your budget for the day!
