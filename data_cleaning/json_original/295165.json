I wasn't pleasant with the lack of simpathy from them. Every question I asked was always answered without no smile, without no help. We were given a twin room with two beds far away from each other and separated by furniture. I asked if I could change to a double room and I was told to put the beds together myself. So me and my girlfriend had to charge the desk (wich was heavy) to a corner of the room, which for me is not acceptable in a 4 star hotel. But for me that wasn't a big issue. The worst for me was when I asked if they could give me a map. The answer was: \"5 Turkish lira\". I've never been to a hotel which charged for simple map. We declined to pay that money, went to dinner to the restaurant next door, and they gave us a free map. The hotel is good, but they made a bad impression on me.

Although the entrance, lounge and general rooms downstairs were fine, I found my bedroom to be tired looking, with a bathroom that did not have any plugs and a toilet that you had to squeeze round from an overlarge sink. As I suffer with a bad back I eventually got a plug so I could have a bath, but the plug didn't fit so I gave up!

We stayed at the Grand Yavuz and was disappointed with the rooms. They were extremely small, the beds were very uncomfortable, the bed covers smelled of stale greasy hair, the bathroom was barely big enough to go into and the bath (over which there was a shower) was actually half the length of a normal bath as a normal bath would not have fitted into the room, the pillows were cheap and uncomfortable, the air con did not perform well enough and therefore the room was stuffy. We could not have the windows open for the night as there was continual noise outside the room from youths who just hung around in the small triangle on the corner of the road the hotel was on. I rang down on the third night as we had had very little sleep over the other nights through the temperature of the room. The Receptionist said they would deal with the laughing and joking at 2am in the morning, we waited 15 minutes and nothing happened, I then went down personally to the reception as even with the windows closed (double glazed too) we could hear them clearly. The Receptionist again said that he would deal with it. However, nothing was done and it wasn't until after 3am that the \"gang\" finally went away of their own accord. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone at all. Apart from that, Istanbul was brilliant and would indeed recommend a visit - just don't be fooled by the 4 star ratings, they clearly do not come near to 4 stars.", "Date": "October 21, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Overall": "3.0"}, "AuthorLocation": "wales", "Title": "\u201cNot as it seems\u201d", "Author": "paulharris1969", "ReviewID": "UR20278229", "Content": "On arrival after an hours drive from the airport, we felt slightly let down from the description of what we had seen online. The hotel is located in what i would call a \"run down\" area of the city. Although the hotel looks nice from the reception entrance, the hotel pictures do not show the surrounding area. The rooftop bar is acceptable, but the view in the day time is a bit of a let down, at night at least the ships lights in the bosphurus is slightly better to look at. On arrival we were advised not to travel further than 10 miles away from the hotel for our own safety. We were also told that a taxi would not take us any further than that distance or pick us up. This alarmed us to say the least. The only saving grace of our 3 day trip was the outing to the grand bazaar, which is an incredible experience. There were no bars, only restaurants.Food was mainly seafood. Was not expecting 5 WTL (\u00c2\u00a32.50) per half pint of lager in the hotel, and everywhere else! Hotel food was great (if you like olives). The blue mosque was an amazing sight to see at night when illuminated. Too many aggressive sellers, from the people who try to get you into their restaurants to the fragrance sellers and everything else! And we paid 125 euros per night for a room accomodating three people. I wouldn't choose to go to Istanbul again. Very steep and cobbled sstreets, not recommended for elderly or disabled.", "Date": "September 22, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "1", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "1", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Louisville, Kentucky", "Title": "\u201cNot good!!!\u201d", "Author": "ClauMex", "ReviewID": "UR19178528", "Content": "We stay there just 1 night, and it was enought for us, we were not happy with the service.

So I call to M\u00c3\u00a9xico 8 min and next day in my check out they gave me the bill and I had to ask for the phone call charge because it was not on the bill, after some minutes, they took a report and charged me 66USD for it!!!!! I was in shock and ask why it is was so expensive, and they never answer something correctly, just said because of the system, the lady in the front desk was very rude, and when I was trying to speak, she was screening in order to does not listen me, she must not work there, because I work in a hotel in Playa del Carmen, M\u00c3\u00a9xico and I am front desk staff and is she works with me, she must be kind and educated the other wise she will not work with me.

We (myself, my wife and two children, 8 and 3 years old) were put up in a so called \"family\" room that consisted of a double bed and a separate single bed. Although the room itself was sufficiently clean, we encountered numerous problems. For a family of four, only two bath towels were provided. I had to contact the reception twice everyday to ask them to provide more. There were stains on the duvet as well as on the hand towels. The airconditioning worked for only a few hours (or probably minutes) everyday. This was the middle of summer in Istanbul, when the temperatures easily reached mid 30s and was extremely humid. I found myself waking up every night sweating. When I asked the reception about the poor airconditioning, this is the reply I got - it has something to do with the central heating, which gets hot shutting off the airconditioning system till it gets cooler. I didn't get it, if someone else did, please let me know. But the thing that I consider inexcusable, is their extremely poor room service. My 3 year old son drinks a glass of warm milk everynight before sleeping. The first time we asked room service for warm milk, they took an hour to bring it to us, complaining of being very busy. My son was already asleep by then. The next day, the same thing happened, and my wife had to personally go down to the restaurant to get some milk. Towards the end of our stay, they did manage to get the milk to us, with just a little delay of 20 minutes. I wish I could write something nice, but there is nothing to recommend in this hotel. As other reviewers have noted, the hotel is close to the main tourist sites, but it sits at the bottom of a hill, and there is a steep climb involved to get out of the area. The reception staff are a bit cold and could do with smiling occasionally and being a bit more friendly. They charge 10 euros or 20 Turkish lira to use the safe in the room (although 5 euros is refunded at the end of your stay). The breakfast menu doesnot change at all. The cold milk on offer with the cereals seems more like cold water with a little milk added in. The juices (only 2 types) were bland and warm. You had to pay for fresh juices. All in all, we were pretty glad to leave the hotel at the end of our vacation. It didn't stop us from having a great time in Istanbul, but a better hotel to relax in at the end of the day would have been better.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "3", "Cleanliness": "3", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "1"}, "AuthorLocation": "Greenwich, CT", "Title": "\u201cOK hotel, Horrible location\u201d", "Author": "JAGR32", "ReviewID": "UR16059030", "Content": "Rooms were average European size (small by American standards) and the beds were extremely hard.

Also, it's frequented by Dutch and German tour groups so the price wasn't cheap. if you want to stay in Sultanamet, you're better off staying at a hotel near Divanyolu Cadessi (where the tram line is) or Akbiyik Cadessi, near the Four Seasons.", "Date": "May 15, 2008"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Check in / front desk": "3", "Overall": "2.0", "Value": "2", "Rooms": "2", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "East Midlands, UK", "Title": "\u201cGood service but not 4 star\u201d", "Author": "UKSheffieldlass", "ReviewID": "UR13493242", "Content": "Stayed here for 4 nights Feb 2008.
