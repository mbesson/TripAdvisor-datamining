This review will sound like a broken record of all the other reviews but there is a reason why. The House Hotel is exactly that- your home away from home. That is if you live in the home of the architects that designed the Dolmabahce Palace. The hotel itself is GORGEOUS! If you want a huge sprawling hotel, this is not the place for you. This was literally the house of a famous architectural family and you can see it in all the detailing of the hotel and rooms. Due to some noise that was NOT under the control of the hotel, we were upgraded to the Bosphorus Suite. And what an upgrade it was. This suite has 2 balconies, both which look out onto the Bosphorus. The downside is that the cute little balcony with a small table and chairs and the breathtaking views makes it VERY hard to want to leave the room. We actually nixed a ferry tour so that we could just relax on the balcony. Besides the beautiful detailing in the rooms, the interior decorating is also very charming. My favorite was the bedside lamp that looks like a golden birdcage. It's details like this that make me fall in love with certain hotels. And my favorite part of the rooms- L'Occitane bath products. Sold! That's when I knew everything in this hotel was luxurious. In addition, they provide complimentary bottles of water and my favorite, complimentary brunch. The brunch is located in their library with more amazing views. The food is great with lots of options. The perfect way to start your morning. As for location, it couldn't be any better. You have the most amazing view of the Bosphorus Bridge. Watching it change colors at night was amazing. You are also in walking distance of tons of restaurants, shops and ferry tours. If you are looking to go to do touristy stuff, it is an easy 30 min walk (or quick bus ride) to the Dolmabahce Palace or the Metro which takes you right to old town. Super easy. You are also about a 45 min walk to Bebek which is an adorable little waterfront town to the north. And I had to save the best part for last. What really made The House such a memorable stay was the service. Bahar, the manager, came to greet us when we were done with breakfast. She introduced herself and apologized for the noise (which wasn't their fault). She told us she was changing our room so we were farther away from the noise. She also sent us a bottle of wine and made sure everything was perfect from then on out. Her and her staff were all so helpful and friendly, we were sad to go to the next hotel. She was so great that When we had a terrible experience at the next hotel (Le Meridien Etiler), I emailed her and she was able to get us a room at her sister hotel, The House Hotel Nisantasi. I can't wait to go back to Istanbul and even more, I can't wait to stay at The House Hotel Bosphorus and see Bahar!", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Dundee, United Kingdom", "Title": "\u201cWonderful Hotel w/ Fabulous Staff\u201d", "Author": "mouniratassi", "ReviewID": "UR127115632", "Content": "My wife and I went to Istanbul for our Honeymoon.

There was fresh water in the room each day for us, nice comfortable robes, slippers and a nice marble bathroom with a great rain shower and L\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Occitane bathroom amenities. The room also had a safe for keeping valuables. The breakfast was excellent. Delicious Turkish food with a wonderful view over the Bosphorus. I could stay in the breakfast hall for hours. The Ortak\u00c3\u00b6y area where the hotel is located is very lively area with amazing restaurants, cafes, the Bosphorus bridge and we can take a Bosphorus tour outside the hotel. You can have a lovely walk or sit on a pinch and watch enjoy the view any-time of the day. We had the chance to watch the new year's eve celebration from our balcony. Ortak\u00c3\u00b6y area was full of people celebrating and having fun. We watched the fireworks from our room, we really enjoyed watching the celebration from our room without getting wet (it was raining that night).

First and foremost, the staff is uniformly terrific 24/7 -- very helpful, very nice. It is a boutique hotel, located in a renovated residence, so the rooms will very in size. My room was small, but charming with a very comfortable king bed. The bathroom/shower area was excellent with outstanding toiletries. My greatest concern with the room was the serious lack of storage space -- there was no closet and no real bureau space. There was a relatively small valet piece from which to hang clothes and on which to place a small piece of luggage; this was the only space for clothes and this same piece also contained a safe and (if I recall corectly) a mini-fridge. Other than this one small piece, the only option was to put luggage on the floor. I was alone in the room and made it work, but if I was sharing the room, there would not have been comfortable space for two people, two sets of suitcases, etc. I loved the location of the hotel -- Ortakoy is nice respite from the center of Istanbul, but still within easy tram or cab reach. And Ortakoy has nice shops and a bazaar, with good restaurants nearby. The hotel itself is well situated in Ortakoy, overlooking the Bosphorus and next to restaurants, bars and the Ortakoy bazaar. Breakfast, which is quite good, is served in a lovely room and adjoining terrace area with Bosphorus views. As other reviewers have noted, there is quite an active bar scene at the hotel and so, if you are noise sensitive, that may be a concern. However, my room was on the \"bar side,\" overlooking the Bosphorus and I did not find the noise a problem. All in all, this is a very good choice, albeit a not inexpensive choice -- but the great staff, location and overall feel make it an extremely worthwhile hotel option.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "3", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "New Providence, New Jersey", "Title": "\u201cGreat Boutique Hotel - but not without watch-outs\u201d", "Author": "fhpete", "ReviewID": "UR120893410", "Content": "Lots of positives here for sure: The location can't be beaten, the design is clean and fresh, food is great and the staff is super attentive and ready to take care of you from arrival to departure. Other reviewers have complained about the staff and I have no idea what they are talking about. The bed is super comfortable and housekeeping staff know what they're doing and room amenities are everything you need for a comfortable stay. On the neutral side: This is a boutique hotel so rooms are small....and they don't apologize for that. I booked a superior room with a king bed. I think this is their lowest category room. It is just larger than the King bed, no closet - so your clothes are hanging beside you while you sleep. Views from this category are also limited. The nightly noise in some other reviews is real with a bar that beats out base till the wee hours of the night. Not a big deal - but if you demand silence when you sleep, its a watch-out. The bathroom is beautifully designed, but again - small. I was on the first floor and heard the flush of toilets above me throughout the room. Water temperature fluctuated radically while I showered. This was an apartment building before it was a hotel (I'm told), so perhaps the old plumbing accounts for this.

Without it, this would be THE perfect hotel in Istanbul for me.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "united states", "Title": "\u201cLoved it!\u201d", "Author": "sferringto", "ReviewID": "UR116474608", "Content": "Did not know what to expect from my first trip to Turkey. The staff were very welcoming and helpful. The room was very comfortable and had the most spectacular view. There was so much to see and so much going on that I could just sit and watch and be entertained. The breakfast was probably my favorite part of the stay there. The view from the dining area was unobstructed and breathtaking. My next favorite part was the playlist they had. We had a blast in the restaurant and met so many people from all over the world. I love boutique hotels and this one was very special. Not too big, not too small. I would highly recommend this place and will definitely go back.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Cleanliness": "5", "Sleep Quality": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Service": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "kuwait", "Title": "\u201cwonderful experience\u201d", "Author": "mashmoom", "ReviewID": "UR115792715", "Content": "I do love these kind of boutique hotels and their location , the House Hotel Bosphorus has prime locations in Istanbul in an area called Ortukoi , the area is full of life day and night , full of cafes , restaurants and crowd you always feel in company even if you are alone . The location of the hotel is so great with a wonderful sea view , i loved the view from the hotel lounge where you can have your meals especially breakfast in front of the sea and enjoy your turkish coffee . the rooms are too small , modern and convenient but at the end of the day you only need your room is for bed time . One thing i didn't like was the noise that you hear at night in your room ,the noise was disturbing only week ends Friday and Saturday night . They've started working on tripling the windows of the hotel to be extra sound proof . The food and service are excellent . Suitable for couples , friends and solo .

All of the staff we encountered were friendly, well-trained, polite, knowledgeable and willing to help out to make our time as enjoyable as possible.

But to our delight, it was everything we had hoped it would be and teething issues were at a minimum. The building itself is a period building which has been beautifully restored within the constraints inevitably placed on listed buildings. We were greeted on arrival by the manager, Alp, who made us feel instantly welcome and was always on hand to help us throughout our four night stay. The hotel is right on the Bosphorus with views of the Bosphorus Bridge, the Maiden Tower, Topkapi Palace (in the distance) and the myriad passing ships. These views are the equal of those from the hotel's neighbours, the renowned Kempinski and the Four Seasons. The hotel has its own very good restaurant but it also sits atop the trendy House Cafe (same owners, apparently), which always has a great buzz. Next door is Banyan, an excellent Asian fusion restaurant with an amazing bar, which by itself is a powerful draw for an early (or late) evening cocktail. The location (Ordakoy) is great, first for the views but also if you enjoy a bit of atmosphere, as it's a popular area for eating, walking or just hanging out by the Bosphorus. However, if you're looking for peace and tranquility, you might prefer elsewhere. Also worth mentioning is the pleasure of waking up to enjoy a delicious breakfast on the restaurant balcony looking directly onto the Bosphorus. None of this would matter, of course, if the service did not live up to the hotel and its surroundings but it did. The staff, led by Alp, a true gentleman, was always friendly and helpful. We definitely expect to stay here again on future stays in Istanbul.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cConcept, location and view...\u201d", "Author": "NYC_LONDON_travel", "ReviewID": "UR115612130", "Content": "Handsome property retaining the original details while enhancing it with new features.
