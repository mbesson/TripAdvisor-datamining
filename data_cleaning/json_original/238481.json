The dirty black wallpapers, the stained floor carpets, the tearing towels like rags, the cracked ceilings, the mould wardrobes, the broken and uncovered lightings and the webs of spiders hanging from the ceilings were really disappointed us during the most important part of our trip in Italy. In addition, the space among the beds was extremely restricted for quadruple rooms and the toilet was separated from the room with a drawn door which did not entirely close. The antennas of the televisions were broken, some of the sockets did not work and the drain system in the toilet was blocked. We were also really surprised when the reception stuff offered us the air condition for an additional rate of 13 euros per day (!!!!).
