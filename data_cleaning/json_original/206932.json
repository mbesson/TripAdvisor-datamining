It also has the little more warm than very cold countries. the sea shore is remarkable. the small hillocks on east sie of city make it even better. The location of Hotel Husa Pedralbes is fantastic but the Hotel does not have restaurant of it's own. The rooms are little too small. The TV has just about 3-4 channels", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "4", "Overall": "3.0", "Value": "4", "Sleep Quality": "4", "Rooms": "3", "Location": "3"}, "AuthorLocation": "Reading", "Title": "\u201cOut of the way\u201d", "Author": "reatigger", "ReviewID": "UR120002984", "Content": "This hotel is away from the centre but not far from University. It is in a nice area, with some shops and restaurants around. Helpful and friendly service at the front desk. My corner room in the back was small but quiet due to double doors.
