The bathroom is huge, the colors used in the room was so gorgeous. The hotel is centrally located so you can walk all around the downtown area.

I did go through the tunnel to get to the casino which they say is safer but when you are alone in the tunnel by yourself at anytime, one wonders about how safe they really are walking alone. Yes, I am sure there is security but just the idea how fast can security get to you if you are assaulted or robbed in the tunnel. I started just walking out the casino door and across the intersection to get to the hotel. I did have an experience with a homeless man, I assume he was homeless with his pillowcase full of whatever playing the slots beside me. I won a small jackpot and he started cursing me out. I notified a slot attendent and the man had taken off. She said, next time just push the help button if he does it again. I thought, that doesnt solve the problem the man is still in the casino bothering people. I went to the other side of the casino and there he was again. He came up to me and said something about you gonna win another jackpot which should be mine. I just left and went back to my hotel room and next morning was glad it was time to go home.

Overall, I will say the stay was fine. The staff were very friendly and remembered me by name every time I walked through the lobby. The room was nice and comfortable. I had the pleasure of being upgraded to a suite so my room was a nice little escape. I was an early check-in and somehow the room had shown in the computer as ready but when I went in the room, it had not been completely serviced (i.e. dirty washcloths in the shower, last customers soaps still in the shower, trash items not emptied). I called the front desk and within minutes the housekeeping staff was there and had the room serviced for me. The convention center space looks very nice for the conference that I was attending. However, the internet was painfully slow throughout the convention center. The rooms we were in had a projector that was not functioning properly and could not be focused. While the staff was very gracious and replaced it with a newer one, the inconveniences slowed the pace of the conference and got it off to a bit of a rocky start. If they update their network infrastructure and audio/visual equipment it would help the rating on this location tremendously. As a business traveler I rely on my ability to communicate via the internet and this was very much an issue here. It just didn't seem like a Harrah's standard of service. As far as the location goes, all I can say is that you are within walking distance of great entertainment and great food. Bourbon street is about a 7 minute walk from the hotel, several great restaurants are within less than 5 minutes walk. All in all, nothing just overwhelming with this hotel/convention center. I would stay here again, but if I was presenting I would make sure I had my own wireless hotspot and my own projector.

Not expecting a room that early in the first place it really wasn't an inconvenience, but we said if it was really ready we would take it. When we got to the suite Nicole was there checking it out to be sure it was ready for us. So, we had a beautiful suite for $69 a night. Everything was spotless, no dust , nothing.

Morning papers are not delivered but can pick up a USA today or local paper for free at the main desk. Riverwalk (shops) and the Hilton are right next door with Dragos in the Hilton. There is also a pub/brewery restaurant next door. Also, some restaurants in the casino. Thus, very good food is real close by. Bourbon street is a few blocks away about a good 10 minute walk.

Obviously it's newer than the others. The room (1518) was so spacious, clean, and near the ice machine (very important) and elevators. Besides the comfortable king size bed there was a couch, coffee table, 2 uphostered chairs, desk, end tables, a bench at the foot of the bed, great lighting and a flat screen tv. The large bathroom had a huge tub, small separate shower and a little toilet room. The contemporary decor included artistic photos of places around the city. There is a fitness center but I didn't visit it and there is no pool or spa. Employees were friendly and helpful. I did have a problem with getting enough towels everyday, but the manager assurred me that it wasn't a hotel issue but something with the linen source and was being addressed. The casino is attached to the hotel by an underground tunnel or you can walk across the street. There are a number of restaurants in and next to the hotel, Ruth's Chris is one, and plenty of them within walking distance. The trolley is not right outside the door but near by. Valet parking is $34 a day so I recommend self parking. If you play for 30 minutes in the casino you can get free parking by swiping your players card at the parking validation machine. Just a tip on this , if you take your vehicle out after it's sits there for more than a 24 hour period you will have to pay the difference, so my husband and I would swipe both of our cards (different #s) so that we would have two validation tickets and that took care of the cost of extra hours. One of the things I suggest you do besides roaming the French Quarter is visiting the National WWII Museum which is new, big and very informative if not moving. I also had a great time at the Old New Orleans Rum Distillery, www.oldneworleansrum.com. It's hard to find but they do offer a van transportation if you are on the east end of the French Quarter. I would definately stay at Harrah's New Orleans again especially if they give me the the great room rate I had for this stay.

I called ahead and asked about hotel guest parking, they informed me diamonds have free parking so we did valet. Wrong, it's a good thing I asked at the desk again because it is 35 a night. I used my points to pay for first night then used the parking garage afterwards, which even as a hotel guest we had to get a validation ticket showing we gambled everyday. I would think they would have a ticket they could give you when you checked into the hotel you could just place inside your car window. Parking is confusing and seems every employee has a different outlook or knows nothing. The garage is always full, so parked on 9th majority of the time.

For starters,let me just say that I have become very spoiled from my usual travel destination caesars palace in vegas ,so considering i am used to their best rooms let me just add as far as room quality and service i am more than happy to say that i was very pleased and loved the quality of our room very much. we had 24th floor with a view of the river(rm#2403) we found it as special in nola to look out at the river as we do looking out our vegas window and watching the bellagio fountains. we are not pool ppl,despite it being probably the hottest days they have had this summer while we wwere there so i cant complain about the lack of a pool. It may take some getting used to someone at every turn saying hello or welcome back but its still a nice touch. my only honest complaint in regards to the property was a lack of an on site gift shop, you still had to actually go thru the passage way into the casino to get something you may have forgotten or the usual unexpected things we get from hotel gift shops,be advised,its not open 24 hours,and actually does not open until 10am,not sure what time it closes. at 1st for a new visiter to nola, being told a place you are looking for is just a block over may seem intimidating when the streets around harrahs seem to go at weird angles,but it only took us a day to feel as if we knew where we were goinjg when it came to finding shops and the fq,or even just catching the trolly. as far as the casino,I didnt at all feel it was as smokey as i had read priopr to our trip,but it was very crowded on a saturday,and being used to vegas sized casinos i did feel the selection of slot machines was not as i had hoped. many max bets were higher than the ones i like to play in vegas.but I am here to rate the hotel not the casino. the beds were possibly as comfy as any ive ever slept in. houskeeping was almost silent and never had any issue with noise on our floor. going back to its lack of an onsite gift shop,we enjoyed some in room adult beverages and thats where buying your mixers befor hand may come in handy,there are vending machines which will run you approx 3 bucks a coke . beshi steak house was a real treat. i had a bone in sirloin that was out of this world,wife loved her prime rib. with both of us less seafood fans than most ppl in nola should be we found the buffet our main disapointment, not only for dinner,but we were suprised by the odd hours for breakfast,please check when you arrive the exact times because on weekends the buffet switches to brunch at some point befor 10am, so you will end up paying a much higher price for sleeping in just a little longer. i would highly reccomend even if you dont wish to gamble using the casino entrance when going to the french quarter or canal street coming and going, its an easy walk thru the casino,and by far a huge relief from the heat. elevators to rooms run very fast and the overall feelings i had all over the property was that everyone just seemed happy to be there. If we should decide to return to new orleans i wouldent hesitate to stay anywhere else. If you are more of a casino person like myself feel free to contact me in regards to any pluses or minuses I felt in regards to the gaming.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "", "Title": "\u201cNice hotel with great customer service\u201d", "Author": "espears", "ReviewID": "UR132918425", "Content": "A great hotel close to everything spacious rooms and friendly hotel staff the only thing missing is there is no pool.", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "5", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "hazleton, pa", "Title": "\u201cGreat stay in great city!\u201d", "Author": "dsm640", "ReviewID": "UR132341211", "Content": "My husband and I stayed at the Harrah's in New Orleans for four nights starting 6/14/12.

I know, it's a casino but I have been to others that had a much better filtration system. Next, the buffet was $35 per person. There were others in line before us and I watched people turn away from the cashier. When we approached, my husband asked what happened and the person said they didn't want to pay $35 each. We almost turned around too but he received a 25% discount for being military. So, it was only $50 something. As for the food, it was not impressive. The $35 tag was because it had seafood on the buffet. By seafood they meant crablegs. Since we don't eat crablegs it was a waste of money.

The view was nice, but would have been better if not partially blocked by the Loew's Hotel just across the street. Basically, I would rate this hotel room as excellent, completely comparable to other Harrah's hotels in which we have stayed. Spacious bathroom with separate potty closet; shower separate from tub. Single sink, but plenty of room on each side. The bed was extremely comfortable. The room contained a small refrigerator and a safe, an important feature in a casino hotel. We did not use the hotel's wifi, as there is an extra charge (I think $13.95). Instead, the AT&T cell signal was strong and provided satisfactory data service on my iPad. Every staff member we encountered was extremely friendly, helpful, and courteous. A complaint I would have about this hotel is that restaurant facilities are lacking. Strangely, there is a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse inside the hotel itself, and then a separate upscale steak restaurant called Besh within the casino. We had a late lunch at the casino buffet on arrival, then breakfast there the next morning. I do not recommend eating at the buffet; in both quality and variety it does not meet the standards of most other casino buffets we have experienced. Also, the casino itself lacks a 24-hour cafe seen at others. For breakfast, I recommend Cafe Adelaide in Lowe's just across Peters St. from the hotel front door. (Try the French toast!) The cafe front door opens directly onto Peters. Another handy and moderately-priced restaurant we tried was Gordon Biersch, which we enjoyed and would recommend. As for the casino, it's about what you might expect--meaning smoky, noisy, crowded. Personally, if I had a choice I would go elsewhere; in this case I didn't have a choice.

It's an adult playground that should be left that way. I appreciate the level of security this establishment has. There is security at every single entrance to keep the teenagers and homeless out! For Harrah's safety, they cannot have anyone under the age of 21 on the casino floor, therefore no underage are allowed inside any casino doors.

The major parts of our trip were comped by Caesars Entertainment/ Harrahs New Orleans - air, ground transportation from the airport, hotel and a couple of meals at the hotel.

Out of the two visits inside for drinks and snacks, only once was there just a 'couch with a coffee table' but a table opened up within 5 minutes and she got us moved over with ease. I can't say enough good things about her - can't recall her name though is started with a C - I'm thinking Corneta?! She is a true asset to Harrahs! They had several snack options which was plenty as it covered all bases. Mini muffalettas, crackers, cheese and fruit, chips and dip, etc. The casino was always full but never had a problem getting on the desired slot machines (which have a beverage service request - it was Awesome!) The drinks were ALWAYS delivered very promptly. As for the hotel, itself, the Staff couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating! They were tremendous - at times they had short lines but they moved very quickly. The housekeeping staff was always available within minutes as was room service.

I had five nights at the hotel property afforded to me complimentary on behalf of Harrah's. I am a Diamond member of the Total Rewards program. Reservation was made the month prior to my stay over the winter holidays. I arrived at the hotel property shortly before noon and was notified by the front desk attendant that I would not be able to check-in early. With that notice I took the liberty of utilizing self-parking. There is a charge for the Harrah's parking garage, but I was pleasantly surprised that I had my parking fees waived as another privilege of being a Diamond Total Rewards member. The parking garage is connected to the hotel property and offers an underground connection the the Harrah's Casino across the street. Check-In As it was the winter holiday season the lobby was bustling with pedestrian traffic of all types ranging from families to couples of all ages and types. I approached the front desk counter where my reservation of five complimentary nights was confirmed. Since I do not prefer to leave a credit card on file, I was allowed to place a cash deposit on the hotel room ($100 per night of stay required). I was placed in room 1505 that offered a very scenic view of the Mississippi River. Total check-in time was less than eight (8) minutes. The Room The assigned room for my reservation was on the 15th floor of the hotel property. Upon entering the hotel room it was surprisingly spacious and well-kept compared to other Harrah's properties that I have stayed at. The bathroom is spacious, offering a separate shower and bath tub as well as large vanity area and separate toilet area. The closet and entertainment center were cleverly designed into the wall to permit a more open floor plan. The king-size bed as well as other linens in the room exhibited a purple color scheme that is distinctive of many Harrah's properties. The Stay The room was well-kept throughout our stay during the week. The best part about this property is the proximity to many of the attractions in the area and nearby French Quarter. You did have to utilize your room key as evidence of stay, which I found to be a great security measure especially during the holiday season. Also, the hotel rooms utilize an electronic notification system that allows you to digitally label the room as occupied, requiring housekeeping service or simply \"Do Not Disturb\". I did enjoy the turn down service provided to my hotel room after arriving each day of busy excursions throughout the city. I did eat at the Gordon Biersch restaurant located on property, which offered great classic American food. The garlic fries were especially delicious. I also ate at the Grand Isle Fresh Seafood Restaurant located adjacent to the hotel property, which is a fantastic restaurant serving great local cuisine. Both meals were pricey, but complimentary on behalf of Harrah's and their restaurant partner locations throughout the city. The hotel does offer a business center located among their conference rooms, but internet access does cost extra. Check-Out The check-out process was quick. I was furnished my cash deposit immediately upon check-out and the process took less than two minutes. Overall Experience I thoroughly enjoyed the complimentary stay at this Harrah's property and was a great way to experience New Orleans at little cost to me.

He checked the computer and actually told us that because we were only 'gold' Total Rewards members, there was nothing he could do for us. So basically, because we don't gamble alot in their casino, we were second class citizens. As we were tired, and there was no other availabe rooms nearby, we stayed there reluctantly. Also, without notice, they put a hold on our bank account for more than double the room rate. I was told it would be a week or so before that charge is refunded.

WHAT A JOY these folks are! Hospitality and concern for your having a fun time was not just from the Concierge but from everyone from Housekeepers to Hotel Management staff Check in was quick and courteous and Bell service awesome Room was very nice and roomy with that special Harrah's touch of correct color coordination and style. Bathroom large with separate glass shower and tub was a nice touch. (LOTS AND LOTS of hot water was a good thing too) Room location was a little low for my tastes (6th floor) and definitely too close to the Harrah's parking garage. Did not spend a lot of time in the room BUT if I had that would have been annoying. (CAR ALARMS!!) Lobby area of the hotel and onsite Steak House very nice. There is a covered area that connects the hotel to the casino underground system and it is well lit and maintained at all times. Casino is across the street BUT it is connected via underground tunnel so even if the weather is bad NO ISSUES getting to the Casino Casino was very well maintained and the staff on EVERY level there was exactly like the hotel. Courteous, prompt and knowledgeable (Found myself challenged by the drink ordering system that is embedded into the machines BUT a lovely Cocktail waitress helped me figure it out) Great selection of slots and did not get rich but did not lose a lot either. VERY even play to win ratio for the most part. Ate in every restaurant that was in the casino area and all were very good and the staff once again hospitable. Buffet was very good and a great selection of Southern style cooking with a complimentary glass of wine served at your table. Gift shop was small and did not have ANY of Harrah's swag (shirts, jackets etc) that actually said Harrah's New Orleans on them. A little disappointed in that but otherwise good. Within walking distance of Canal and Bourbon streets and everyone is helpful in getting you to where you are going.

This hotel doesn't need a casino to make it a destination. It is reasonably close to the river as well as Bourbon Street and other attractions in New Orleans. We arrived fairly early on a Sunday morning just returning from a cruise. Absolutely no problem checking in with good instructions on how to access the parking lot (we normally use Valet, but had too much stuff in the car to put it all away). Parking was free with validation of 30 minutes of slot machine play or a longer period on a table game. I believe that the free parking applied to either the valet or self park. Our room which was on 19th floor had an excellent view of the city. It was extremely spacious (could be that our balcony cabin on the ship had something to do with our perception of the size of the room), but sincerely it was the largest of 4 rooms we stayed in on this particular trip. Not only large, but very classy in decor and furnishings with a king size bed, sofa, arm chair, ottoman coffee table and desk with chair.. The bathroom was very large with tile walls and floor with seperate tub, shower and toilet. There was plenty of room for incidentals on the commode. The room was also equipped with a mini- refrigerator, coffee maker and wireless internet (although all Harrah's hotels charge for this service; $12,00 in this case). The room was spotlessly clean and everything was in good repair. We were also very pleased with a top sheet covering the blanket. There are a number of restaurants easily accessible from this hotel, two of which are Ruth's Chris Steak House and Besh Steak along with a buffet in the casino plus others whose names escape me at this point.

The room was clean and spacious,the bedding was wonderful and there was a great soaking tub in the bathroom. The hotel staff was accommodating, I asked for extra coffee packets in the room and it was taken care of each day after that. This was our 4th visit to New Orleans and we had never really taken advantage of the trolley before but our hotel was near the trolley line so we learned the routes and it really came in handy. We also walked quite a bit, it is just a few blocks from Bourbon Street. We also walked the river walk to my husband's favorite morning destination, the Cafe Du Monde! Speaking of breakfast, one morning I just wanted to have the little diner experience so we asked the concierge. She told us about the cafe across the street but I had already checked out there menu and it wasn't what I was looking for. Then she told us about Mother's and it was exactly what I was looking for! A breakfast special for less than $6, grits, eggs, biscuits, sausage and coffee, no substitutions, and you stand in line to place your order. My husband got the stack of 3 pancakes and they were so big he couldn't finish them. It is worth the visit just for the experience. We flew for two of our visits and we drove for two of our visits. I was really nervous about driving in this time because parking was such an issue when we came June 2010 with our family. Because we stayed at Harrah's this time we learned very quickly that parking wasn't an issue. As long as you play 30 minutes a day at the casino and swipe your Total Rewards card to validate it, there will be no charge to park and there are plenty of spaces. This was a real bonus. We ate at Besh Steak one evening and it was enjoyable. Our salads were wonderful! If there was a negative at all it would be that there is no pool and no free wireless. They do have a partner hotel right across the street that has a pool and Harrah's guests can use. I believe it is free for Total Reward card holders but be sure to confirm. As far as wireless, I am all about a hotspot in a hotel, it can be in the seating area of the lobby, I am not picky.

I have a Seven Star card so maybe that had something to do with it, but I also saw other guest and they all seem to be getting very good attention also. I went straight to my room to drop my bag off and another surprise awaited me. As soon as I opened the door I saw a beautiful basket with goodies on the wall table. I walked down the hall and into a beautiful suite. It was so nice; I wish someone else was there to see it. This is the second visit to New Orleans and both times I stayed at Harrah's. The room before this was very nice also; two queen beds and a large bathroom. This time the suite had a bathroom that was as large as my bedroom at home. A nice soaking tub and a separate glass shower, a built in white marble vanity with two sinks and stool between them. The entrance was through the bedroom. I don't think I can return without having this room. Everything went so well on this short trip. I had a comp for the buffet Thursday night. Friday night I had another comp for dinner at one of the restaurants Harrah is affiliated with so I chose Besh Steak House. It was a great surf and turf dinner. I had a wonderful night\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sleep and woke Friday morning feeling so rested. The bed was comfortable the pillows nice. I took a shower and went down to Canal Street for a walk.

I stopped at CVS to buy bubble bath so I could relax in the tub before going out Friday night; I just could not leave without getting in that ceramic beauty.

I felt very safe even at 2:00 am. My wakeup call came at 4:30 Saturday morning. I showered and dressed quickly, took the elevator to the lobby and had them print my boarding pass.

Harrah's is a good casino, its well kept and it looks as good as casinos in Las Vegas, Dealers are very friendly and they truly have a great crowd that goes there.. its a mix of older and middle age people having drinks and having a good time. as soon as you walk in, they check your I.D and make sure you are legal to gamble, to some people it must be annoying but i love the fact that they have people on their payroll, making sure only right people enter their facility and yes they run your driver liscense into three different things to make sure its not a fake I.D as most of us know, how easy it is to get a fake I.D. Everybody wears a name tag and a bage which says \" did i provide you with A+ Service\", looks like the things have started to change, they are trying their best to elevate service, But the drink service was really slow, i couldnt get a drink on a roulette table for good 30-45 min wait on three ocassions i was there. On their end, they have Iphones and guest service managers on the floor taking orders but it is not working for some reason, they need to change that system and just assign servers on certain areas of the casino. Other than that, i had a great time at this casino, they have a poker room a really big one, a bar with poker machine, huge selection of slots, roulette table, black jack tables and anything you can think of.

Robes and an umbrella in the closet for guest use (what a nice surprise to fin). Lots of city information available in our room. Loved that there was a fridge in the room and found out that many hotels do not have them. The bellmen and front desk staff greeted us upon each arrival and departure. Our room was cleaned, bed made daily, towels changed upon request. Oh, and if you've never slept in a Harrah's bed, you will understand my love for them after you do! Great location for riverfront activities and not too far of a walk to Bourban St. We tried to fit it all in during our 5 day stay, but it wasn't possible so we plan on going back for sure! Loved the city, the architecture, the food, the people! Did not expect to have as much fun as we did! The casino was clean and even though there is smoking throughout, you don't smell it unless someone is sitting right next to you smoking. Wish the Starbuck's was closer to the other end of the casino, closer to the hotel, but of course we know why it isn't and it worked EVERY time! We also enjoyed the taxi whistle that the Harrah's crew uses! The room size was incredible and the bathroom was great. Enjoyed the 2 person tub size for a bit of relaxation. We did not use room service, seemed a little pricey, but I don't use it anyway in a city where getting out and about is part of the fun! We did the Steamboat Natchez for lunch and would do it again. The $10 extra for the lunch is worth it and there are coupons for discounts online. The bread pudding, the fried chicken and jambalaya were the best. IMAX Katrina was breathtaking...a must! We felt completely safe in and around this property. Actually, even in the hustle and bustle of the events on Bourban St, everyone is just having a good time and we felt completely safe, especially with the police presence on horses all night.

We have dined at Grand Isle Seafood Restaurant, Besh Steak, Gordon Biersch, and all are highly recommended. We enjoyed Fuddruckers for a quick lunch, but did not like McAllisters Deli (expensive price for a sub-standard sandwich that was not generous with meat portions and the bread was stale). And, Gordon Biersch has a great happy hour with speciality cocktails and tasty delicious appetizers, its a must do every visit. The CASINO has a great mix of slot machines (reel and video) with varied denominations. The beverage service on the floor is very prompt, tip a little bit extra ($5 for the first round), and they're ready to serve you again before You're ready for the next cocktail. Its a fun casino, very Mardi-Gras themed and so eye appealing, and love the marching brass band that parades through the Casino every night! We don't typically dine at the BUFFET, as there are way too many other great restaurants to dine at in New Orleans and on property, can't comment on it, except as we walked past a few times we noticed extremely long wait lines.

There were no Wheel of Fortune or similar types that are in every other casino I have been in elsewhere. At least three machines malfunctioned when trying to cash out with a ticket.

The roulette dealers at two tables seemed less than able to keep up with the play at their tables and it took an extremely long time to get from one spin to the next.

I rate this hotel 3 stars, because I think that as nice as it is the Loews had more of a boutique feel and cost less (about $70 less!) for a very similar stay.

They were wonderful. They remembered my name after the check-in throughout my stay. They were very accomodating and gracious. We were there for 4 days Feb 26-Mar 1 2009. The room was a comp that my friends received because of their status as casino players. I hadn't gambled in 8 years. So I took along $1300.00 of which I earned a WHOPPING GRAND TOTAL OF $5.00 In rewards!!!! The room itself was very nice, it had a built in media/closet and a safe box which was handy. The hallways were littered with trays for days. It would take ALL day long for them to be removed (that is just plain GROSS!) The housekeeping lady was sitting on the floor at 9am or so when I passed her, I came back around 10:15.........STILL SITTING THERE ON HER CELL PHONE BLABBING! Even if she was on break, it should have been done OUT of view! Oh and if you don't turn on your light you wont get your room cleaned and even if you do, you had best plan on being gone a LONG time. I came back 4 times during the day, finally I told the young lady to just refresh my towels and to take the food tray ( she placed it in the hallway where it sat for 15 hours.) There were a few problems, had I not visited my friends room next door I wouldn't have KNOWN that I wasn't given the duvet comforter (which would have been nice.) My door broke the 2nd night we were there, the return arm fell. Thank God it didn't fall on ME! It weighed about 25 lbs and was dangerous! The casino had very expensive dining. The Casino eateries SUCK! Bambu should be named Shamu. Was some of the WORST food ever created. The buffett is GROSS and institutional. The Hotel has a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, that was fabulous, across the way is Gordon Biersch, it was also absolutely fabulous and the food was amazing. Highly recommend both of these. Also Adelaide's at Loew's Hotel was some of the best food I have EVER had in my life. All in all the hotel was OK........the staff beyond housekeeping was great, but the Casino was the WORST. I expect to LOSE $..........just not so damn fast! It wasn't even fun!

I contacted security and two attendants came and told me I had to pay them $250 cash to remove the boot. This seemed like a scam to me so I went to the security office in the casino and I asked why all the other vehicles that were similarly parked were not booted too, I was told they did not have enough boots. The security manager was very sarcastic and told me I had to go back and pay the two attendants $250 if I wanted to have my vehicle released. I refused to hand over $250 cash to some strangers in the garage. The manager made a call to someone and I was then told I could pay the money at the cash cage. I had to pay in order to get my vehicle. It is highly unfair and poor policy to penalize only a few people and let dozens of others slide just because Harrah's is too cheap to buy enough boots.

DO NOT USE YOU TOTAL REWARDS CARD IT'S BAD NEW'S. This is what Harrah's New Orleans did to me and they will do the same to you as well... My name is Louis Smith and I live about 100 mile north of New Orleans, in a city called Hattiesburg, MS. I'm a PLATINUM Card Holder and my brother is a GOLD card Holder. We both booked a room on Harrash's New Orleans for a Sat night stary in July 2008 using both of you players cards. If I were to use just my Platinum card I would have paid $129 for the room and by using a guest players card the room would be comp at no cost. My brother and I book a room using both of you players cards two week before arriveing into New Orleans. Harrah's even emailed me comfermations the the room reservation would be comp at no cost. Well, when my brother and I arrived by train Sat morning we check into the room at the front desk and later got a phone call from VIP services. A Harrah's Guest Service Agent told me that all of my Room Reservation that were book using my brothers players card would be cancel. I told the Agent to the reservation was booked online and there was a place to add another guest and their players card and the room rate charnged. She tried to make like my brother did even come with me. What a bunch of crack heads. My broher is in the same room with me and sign into the room with me. They went as far as getting the front desk to check our bags in our room. Which is really against the law. Okay, they cancel all my reservation that I make though Dec and plus charged my visa $115 deposit on some of the room reservations. When I got back to Hattiesburg I call Jim the GM of Harrahs Casino in New Orleans and told him to check into it. He is rude to me on the phone and said that I should go back to Mississippi and play at the Grand Casino. He also told me that I've already used up all my comp for New Orleans. So why did the online Reservations let me book with using my brother as a guest. If they dont want people to add another guest then they should take that feature off their website. The GM at the Harrahs Casino in New Orleans was a Jerk and would do nothing to help me. He even told me that the Slot Tournment that was book months ago would even be taken away from me. Now, that takes the cake. These people DO NOT give a cracks ass about their guest. I've alway gave high raves on this casino but not anymore after being treated like I'm a dirt under their feet. I've spent lot of money at this casino and have never win one red cent!!! I will never spend another dime at this casino and will find another casino that will treat me better. As you can see for yourself below my Tier Score is 5379 and you need to have at least 4000 to be a Platinum card Player. They took away my Platinum level and moved to to GOLD. I've called the Louisana State Police Gaming and reported this to them. If they need this to me they would do the same to you. I earn ever one of those points because I never won a JACKPOT unitil the last day I visited the Casino in New Orleans on July 18, 2008. I won 1300 on a penny machine but put 1,000 of it back into the machine. The feel the Harrah's New Orleans treated in this manner because I won a small jackpot.

All the employees were very polite and entertaining. The cocktail waitresses were very prompt. Didn't hit it big on the games but I had fun trying. The rapid roulette was super. We only had two meals at Harrah's both were at Besch Steak. Mark our server at the bar did an exceptional job. Food was excellant!!!! It is well worth what you pay. The location is a few blocks away from Bourbon Street. But still conveniently located to walk. You can access the trolley cars right on Canal Street, which will take you most anywhere in the city you would want to go. I would get a map from the concierge desk that shows you what cars, go where. You can also purchase a day ticket or 3 day pass at the Marriott located on Canal, that will save you lots of money if you plan to get off at several stops (it is 1.25 (exact change) for each person each time you board) the pass is very helpful.

In fact 20% service charge was on everything from room service even though after waiting nearly an hour for a bottle of wine- I would've only given them 15%. When complaining that there should be robes and water in the rooms for $500.00 night we were given 2 small bottles of water and 2 robes, however the maid toke the robes the next day and were never replaced- either was the water.

Oh yeah- I forgot that the valet parked my friends car and broke the stick shift because it was forced out of park instead of using the button release and they said they wouldnt pay for it and we should get a lawyer!!! They wouldnt even pay for the towing. They claimed it was broken before it came even though they drove it up to the garage?? Huh? If it was broken how did you drive it if it was undriveable after???

The hotel was adequate, but not what we wanted, we were embarrassed to be turned away after paying more than a fair price. Travelocity wasn't much help either, we got no credit for being put out like this, we had to wait until 3:00 the next day to check in, effectively gutting our planned day taking in the sights and scene that is New Orleans, and putting a real damper on our vacation. It was only 2 1/2 days more and we really had to hustle. The customer service center for Travelocity is based in India, they were ineffective and the response we had from them was frustrating and close to useless.

The bathroom toilet was separate from the sink/tub/shower. Nice shower and separate tub. Everything was clean, clean, clean! Great security - you have to swipe your hotel card to get the elevator to your floor. There's a safe in the room. Only a few things I thought they could improve on: 1) they don't sell transit passes (the Hilton and others do); 2) if you have THEM call a cab, they don't run the meters. We had better experiences getting our own cabs. (I swear the cabbie that took us to the airport was high); 3) there's sooo many people to help and they ALL want a tip everytime they open a door for you! We tipped more frequently than usual because we felt pressured; 4) their restaurant, Riche, is okay. Great for dessert but not living up to expectations on dinner.

The hotel itself is absolutely beautiful. The staff is absolutely horrible. The restaurant in the hotel is terrible. They might as well have served a plate of grease. It was not edible. For a $35 breakfast this is not acceptable. We have been Harrah's players for about 10 years. Due to a recent cancer battle I was unable to play as much and was demoted from Diamond to Platinum status. This really makes a difference for these people. The hotel didn't show my comp points as they were and refused to give us any credit on our room charges. They were incredibly rude and advised since they don't have a gaming license it wasn't their responsibility to accommodate us. It was a really strange situation. I finally asked to speak with the manager. A gentleman named Seabourne came over and was even ruder than the desk clerk. I finally called the Total Rewards desk over at the casino who advised that the hotel was completely incompetent and she fixed the problem in about 2 seconds. I sent a complaint in via the website when I returned home and was advised that the general manager Mr. Tran would call me the next day.
