Just take the A1 or A2 bus, depending on the terminal you are at (which cost 5,30 euro one-way), and get off at Plaza de Catalunya where you can catch a train, or what I found easier to avoid transferring was walking to Passeig de Gracia and catch the (purple) line there to Sagrada Familia. Once there just walk toward the KFC, and up the street which is to the left of the split where the gas station is. NOTE: Traveled with my girlfriend and we decided to buy 10-ride metro cards (~9 euro) which we both could use as we needed, instead of spending ~23 euro/each for a 4-day unlimited. This ended up working out in our favor as we ended up purchasing the 10-ride card three times, therefore saving a substantial amount. Got to the apartments around 11:00 am, earlier than the check-in time but they told me they would have a room ready within a half hour so we went to a small restaurant down the block to have some jamon bocadillos. Once we were done the room was ready and I definitely did not expect what I saw upon entering the room. I had compared prices and locations of many hotels and this seemed around the average price for 4-nights and in a nice area, but to walk into a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment with complete kitchen, dining table, living area and patio was definitely excessive but we were definitely not complaining. NOTE: There is a limit on the hot water usage when taking showers; however, I never did reach this limit. I believe it was a liter-measured limit, which will reset 30 minutes after it has been reached. So i suppose you should not take hour-long showers, but dont let that steer you away from such a great apartment/hotel. There was someone at the front desk at all hours. Internet is an extra charge (unless you have it included); but it was only about 4-5 euro/day which is not bad; but, we never felt the need to use it and even found some wifi spots around the city for our phones, one randomly up in montjuic. Apartment was very modern and had soaps, towels, blow-dryer and a safe in the bedroom. There is a supermarket right on the corner which is open rather late and sells pastries and food which we decided to purchase to save some money and make our own food to kick off the day. Sagrada Familia is just down the street, and can be seen from the apartments; definitely a sight to take in and one that you will be seeing everytime you arrive back at the apartment to call it a day. This is the #1 place I recommend all to stay at and will return, hopefully soon!", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "3", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "5", "Sleep Quality": "5", "Rooms": "5", "Location": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Brisbane", "Title": "\u201cPosition, Position, Position\u201d", "Author": "bettyboopinv", "ReviewID": "UR123991010", "Content": "Minutes from the Sagrada Familia and Metro, what more could one want?

Several grocery shops now in the area, including a Carrefors and there is a great buffet restaurant opposite the Sagrada at 9.90 Euro including drinks and dessert for lunch.

This was a wonderful choice for many reasons: - Location: 2 blocks from Sagrada Familia, a metro station and the \"hop on- hop off\" tourist buses. Better yet, we found better shopping and restaurants here in the Eixample district than in the main tourist and shopping drag downtown. - Size: Don't know actual square footage, but it felt like a 900 sq ft. apartment. Modern, spotlessly clean, and very comfortable. - Price: well below hotel choices of comparable quality. - Other Pros: kitchen let us cook our own breakfast which was very useful as Barcelona was not a big breakfast town, and we were battling jet lag from California. Nearby markets were handy with a good enough selection of food and a short walk led to great food shopping. Also, I can highly recommend the nearby restaurant \"Los Bellota\" for the best quality food. The desk staff were helpful and all spoke english well. Note that the desk was manned 24/7, but it is an apartment, not a hotel, so don't expect a concierge. Nonetheless, the staff gave us great recommendations on where to eat, and the checkout time was good. The balcony had great urban views, and yet it was quiet when everything was closed. - Cons: The kitchen could have had a few more items - like a cutting board and a larger pan, even a sponge. Wifi was not free, but was fast and relatively cheap, especially when compared to hotels that charge more for slower speeds. Other notes: they had no iron or ironing board, contrary to what their site said. They do have a coffee maker in every kitchen, but it's the \"bialetta\" stovetop espresso maker, so if you're not used to that (I have one at home) then you may not realize what it is. Bring some Starbucks Via if that's an issue for you. They do have a little washbasin for cleaning clothes, but no drying line that I saw.

Two well sized bedrooms, a large kitchen and living/dining area were all excellent.

The apartment is well worth the money, we saved about 25% on the advertised price by using Trip Advisor, we will return to Barcelona and stay here again. My visiting Barcelona tip is to avoid the taxi drivers, they'll add all sorts of extras to bump up the price.

We liked it more than staying in the hectic centre. Barcelona isn't huge so it is only 15 mins or so on the metro into the the Ramblas. Lots of shops all around to buy essentials - supermarkets, fruit and vegetable shops, bakeries and lots of restuarants and cafes. Enjoyed going to the Boulangerie next door to buy pastries for breakfast each day. We had rooms at the back which was really quiet. The front is probably bit more more noisy although it's not a main road. Cleaners came in every day and put the dishwasher on and staff at the desk were extremely helpful.

The Apartaments are easy to find from the Sagrada Familia Metro station - about 100 metres away. We were warmly welcomed on arrival although it took ages for the reception to check our passport details and for what reason I wasn't entirely sure. Also, we had to pay the full cost of our stay on arrival. This was a surprise as I don't recall being advised of this when making the reservation. As with most debit and credit card transactions in Spain you are offered the options to pay in \u00a3 Sterling or Euros. If you are from the UK chose \u00a3 Sterling as the exchange rate the card processing company applies are not good. Once in the room we were pleasantly surprised at how spacious and clean it was - with one exception being some hair round the bath plug hole! The 2 bedrooms were adequately sized as was the bathroom and the lounge area was very spacious. The kitchen was reasonably well equipped - look out for the cleaning kit with a cloth and washing up liquid. However, the ceramic hob was past its best and the controls were a bit tempremental but OK once sussed out. The room was serviced every day with fresh towels and a clean of the kitchen. The air con was good although we switched it off as we had the windows and balcony door open - the weather was that good even in late October! The rooms facing the front are noisy as Carrer de la Marina is a busy throughfare and this continues into the night but after a short while we aclimatised to this and it wasn't a problem. There are a few food shops nearby but look out for the Eroski supermarket nearby as this is far cheaper and has a wider range than the more immediate shops. The best bar/cafe we found was in Avinguda de Gaud\u00ed - sit outside and take it the wonder of the Sagrada Familia as the night falls - and get a plate of tapas with your apertitif - Superb! Overall, I would recommend staying here but make sure you have enough to pay the bill on arrival.", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "3", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Denmark", "Title": "\u201cGreat appartments\u201d", "Author": "LOH", "ReviewID": "UR44340297", "Content": "very roomy - we stayed 5 adults in one appartment with no problems", "Date": "September 25, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "5.0", "Value": "5", "Location": "5", "Rooms": "5"}, "AuthorLocation": "Seoul, South Korea", "Title": "\u201cClean, roomy, great value and location\u201d", "Author": "GCake1105", "ReviewID": "UR40049135", "Content": "I had a hard time finding an affordable bargain hotel in Barcelona in early September but I booked this one based on reviews and was surprised! First off, the location was great, it is off of the Sagrada Familia metro line just a block away, very easy to locate and a very short walk. The price was 243 euros for 3 nights, about 80 euros per night. When we first went in the front doors to the building we thought the front desk was the parking attendant and that was true, we were taken aback at his small booth. We were asked to pay up front and had to provide passport information they would send to the police (typically required in Europe although not always enforced). Our room was on the 5th floor, and it was huge compared to what we had been used to in Spain since we had a full kitchen, a living room/dining room, a bathroom, one room w/ a double bed and one room w/ a single bed which we did not ask for and also did not use. The place has a contemporary IKEA type decor, with dishes and pots and pans but not much more. Central air conditioning was awesome! Had a TV with very limited channels, no DVD player. Has a balcony with shutters to keep out the sun. Provides limited items such as shampoo, soap, shower gel. No dishwasher soap because the housekeeping runs in the dishwasher every day after you leave if you put dishes inside. I would definitely stay here again.", "Date": "September 7, 2009"}, {"Ratings": {"Service": "4", "Cleanliness": "5", "Overall": "4.0", "Value": "4", "Location": "4", "Rooms": "4"}, "AuthorLocation": "Upstate New York", "Title": "\u201cRoomy, clean, well located, a bit spartan\u201d", "Author": "Packyourbags", "ReviewID": "UR39582061", "Content": "Our family of myself, my husband and two teens stayed here for 5 nights at 162 euros/night. I picked it based on its TA ranking and also checked out the neighborhood with Google Maps street view. I would recommend this hotel. I initially had some reservations (sorry about the pun!) but the place grew on me. Here are some pros, cons and general info. From airport - I emailed the hotel several times to ask advice on this and didn't hear back for quite a while. I finally had a friend who speaks Spanish call. Turns out that the email link on the website doesn't go directly to the hotel but to the booking agency who had not forwarded it. Here is the email address to use: [--]. We traveled by taxi for 30 euros. Our bags didn't make it so it would have been a bit more if they had. Location - It was a bit removed from some sights but I was happy with it. It is just a couple of blocks from the Sagrada Familia so there was a metro stop right there. AND it made it very easy to locate on our maps as we were navigating around. The area was a mix of residential and business. We ate dinner outside, or had ice cream, several times on the street one block over, with the Sagrada Familia in the background surrounded by a mix that was heavier on the locals than tourists, it seemed. There is a good sized grocery store on the same block, down on the corner, which we visited a couple of times a day to pick up bread for breakfast, or snacks, or sodas, etc. Staff - The people at the desk were always very helpful and friendly, answering questions, chatting, providing history info, calling for our taxi, etc. Rooms - Our apartment, which was very clean, was on the 5th floor in the back and overlooked a pretty large area with the backs of other buildings. A street view would have been nice but this was kind of interesting. It was like seeing people\u2019s backyards in a way. The 4 person units are all in the back. There was plenty of room in the living/dining room area (desk, couch, chair, coffee table, some built ins). We ate and played cards at the large glass table. The kitchen was also bigger than expected with a small microwave, small dishwasher, small cook top and large refrigerator. (Great for freezing water bottles overnight and keeping beverages to have at \"home.\") All the floors were tiled \u2013 marble maybe? Could get noisy with the metal chairs. There were doors between the kitchen and the living/dining room area and between the living/dining area and a small hall that the bedrooms and bathroom opened to. That would be good for families with small children who go to bed before the adults. There was a large balcony in the back and a tiny additional balcony off the kitchen that overlooked a small interior courtyard. All the rooms, but particularly the bedrooms, were pretty spartan. The room with 2 twins didn't have much extra space. Our double was actually 2 twins pushed together - a little uncomfortable if you ended up on the \"junction\", but not horrible. Each bedroom had a built-in closet with ample hanging space and several drawers inside. The twin room also had a small set of shelves. There were no clocks, phones, TVs, dressers, or lamps in the bedrooms. Amenities - Pretty sparse. My daughter referred to the shampoo and body wash as \u201csauce packages.\u201d There were plenty of dishes in the kitchen but nothing like soap, towels, detergent, paper towels, napkins, etc., in case you wanted to actually cook. However, maybe that is available if you ask for them. There was a phone in the living/dining room area but no information about the hotel, who to contact, info about the surroundings, etc. There was a TV in the living/dining room with a few stations. The AC was great with an in-room thermostat. A sign in the bathroom talked about conserving water and the 100 liter tank for hot water \u2013 we never ran out. All in all we were pleased with this hotel. It wasn\u2019t luxurious but clean and modern, friendly, well located, and roomy.

I chose this hotel and booked a air/hotel package though europeandestinations.com. Because we were staying for more than a couple nights, we wanted a place where we could stretch out and feel more homey. This place did the trick! We arrived around 10AM but our room wasn't ready for check-in. We were able to stow our luggage with the hotel and go out to see some sights. The next street over is Gaudi, and it's really cool because down one end you can see La Sagrada Familia, and the other end is the Hospital of Sant Pau. Both worth seeing/exploring! After lunch, check in was no problem and quick. We were impressed with our unit for sure! Because of the layout of the unit, this really felt like it could be an apartment and not just an extended stay hotel. The kitchen was convenient but we didn't cook (only used to the fridge to hold water, beer, and cheese). The OpenCor convenience mart was good to pick up whatever we needed, and if you were to walk a few blocks, there were other supermarkets as well. The pros: lots of space to stretch out. The living room/sitting area was nice and the sofa was very comfortable. I loved the balcony overlooking the street! We were on the 5th floor and had glorious views of La Sagrada Familia, especially early in the morning. The location of the hotel is great! The metro is nearby and made it easy to get around. I just loved walking to the metro and seeing La Sagrada Familia...that something so beautiful was just in full plain view as we were going about our day! Cons: Just one...the beds are very hard. My husband and I are pretty easy to please, but these beds were firm to the point of being uncomfortable. We grabbed the extra pillow from the other room and the sofa cushions and made do. We had a great trip and Apartaments Marina made us feel at home.

The positive reviews of other travellers describe my own experience, so I won't repeat them. Just one further piece of advice. When you arrive at the stop Sagrada Familia by metro L5, take the exit Parc Gaudi - when you arrive by metro L2 take the exit Proven\u00e7a : coming onto the street you will see Pizza Hut on the corner.
